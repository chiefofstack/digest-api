CLOTILDE ARZADON, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<br\/>\n<br\/>\nD E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>ARELLANO, C.J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">Laureano Arzadon, as administrator of the estate of Lorenza Angco, demands the surrender of several rural properties which he states are held by the following persons: By Clotilde Arzadon, those described in the complaint and indicated by the letters (<i>a<\/i>), (<i>b<\/i>), (<i>c)<\/i>,\u00a0 (<i>d<\/i>), (<i>e<\/i>), (<i>f)<\/i>, (<i>g<\/i>), W, (<i>i)<\/i>, (<i>j)<\/i>,\u00a0 (<i>k<\/i>), and (<i>l<\/i>); and by Maria\u00a0 Luna, Basilia Corpus,\u00a0 and Ponciano Tacmo\u00a0 those likewise described in the complaint and marked with the letters (<i>m<\/i>), <i>(n<\/i>),\u00a0 and (<i>n<\/i>).\u00a0 He states that the\u00a0 first-named parcels\u00a0 were taken possession of\u00a0 by Clotilde\u00a0 Arzadon immediately after the death of\u00a0 Lorenza\u00a0 Angco,\u00a0 and\u00a0 that she still retains them against the will of the heirs of the latter;\u00a0 and that the last three are also unlawfully held by Maria\u00a0 Luna, Basilia Corpus, and Ponciano Tacmo who took them from the possession of Clotilde Arzadon.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 evidence was presented\u00a0 in the manner contained in the following recorded statement:<br\/><blockquote>\"At the trial of this case on the same day, the attorneys, to expedite\u00a0 the matter, agreed to file their allegations in writing in order that the trial court might render judgment at the hearing thereof, and the parties thereupon submitted their written allegations in the\u00a0 form of statements of their respective witnesses.\"<\/blockquote>These\u00a0 so-called\u00a0 proofs are nothing more\u00a0 than\u00a0 certain papers signed by the counsel of the contending parties, and containing averments seemingly made by various witnesses. At the bottom of that of the plaintiff, which is signed by Attorney A. M. Jimenez, there appears the following:<br\/><blockquote>\"The undersigned attorney rejects all and each one of the immaterial proofs\u00a0 that\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant may offer\u00a0 to\u00a0 the court, denies under oath\u00a0 the\u00a0 presentation of documents lacking legal 'validity, the declarations that may be in conflict with those\u00a0 made by the witnesses of the defendant, excepting therefrom in case of admission by the court, and, lastly, presents two documentary\u00a0 proofs, Exhibits A and B of the complaint.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>That of the defendant, signed by Attorney Lucas Paredes, contains the following:<br\/><blockquote>\"The defendants object to the documents which the plaintiff has\u00a0 offered as evidence, for the reason that they are immaterial, and\u00a0 in the event their objection is overruled they\u00a0 take exception thereto.\u00a0 As documentary\u00a0 proof\u00a0 they offer\u00a0 Exhibits 1, 2 and 3 of the\u00a0 defendants, and with this they rest their case.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>On such proceedings the Court\u00a0 of First Instance of Ilocos Norte rendered the following judgment:<br\/><blockquote><br\/>\"Inasmuch as\u00a0 the whole of\u00a0 the\u00a0 allegations of the complaint have not been proven as required by law, the court dismisses the same with respect to\u00a0 the\u00a0 parcels of\u00a0 land marked with the letters\u00a0 (<i>a<\/i>), (<i>b<\/i>), (<i>c<\/i>), (<i>d<\/i>),\u00a0 (<i>e)<\/i>,\u00a0 (<i>k<!--<I--><\/i>), (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">I<\/span>), (<i>m<\/i>),\u00a0 (<i>n<\/i>), and\u00a0 (<i>n)<\/i>,\u00a0 with the costs against the\u00a0 plaintiff. The latter may dispose as he wishes of the parcels indicated with\u00a0 the letters\u00a0 (<i>f<\/i>),\u00a0 (<i>g<\/i>), (<i>h<\/i>),\u00a0 (<i>i)<\/i>, and (<i>j<\/i>), inasmuch as no one is opposed thereto, without\u00a0 prejudice to attaching to the record hereof a copy of the plaintiff's petition\u00a0 concerning the appointment of an administrator contained in the heading of civil case No.\u00a0 569.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>From\u00a0 the above decision\u00a0 the plaintiff\u00a0 has\u00a0 appealed, and assigned the following errors to the court below:<br\/><br\/>1. In having admitted the agreement presented by counsel in order to dispense with the trial of the case.\u00a0 2. In having dismissed the complaint instead of holding it to be proven. 3. In overruling the motion\u00a0 for a new trial.<br\/><br\/>Among the irregularities contained in the case herein, the most\u00a0 remarkable\u00a0 is that which is alleged as the first error committed in the judgment, the attorney who\u00a0 alleges it being the same one who contributed thereto, and who\u00a0 also suffered\u00a0 therefrom by exposing\u00a0 his complaint\u00a0 to be\u00a0 dismissed on account of lack\u00a0 of legal proof.\u00a0 This lawyer, together with the counsel for the adverse party, moved\u00a0 that his proof be admitted in the form in which it was made, in order, as he now shows, to dispense with\u00a0 the hearing of the case.\u00a0 Such form of procedure can\u00a0 not\u00a0 constitute a trial. It is an open and manifest violation among others, of sections 132, 273, 274, and 381 of the Code of Civil Procedure, Act No. 190 of the Philippine Commission;\u00a0 of\u00a0 section 132, in so far\u00a0 as it establishes the order of the trial which in this cause has been entirely done away with; of section 273, which\u00a0 governs the manner\u00a0 in\u00a0 which\u00a0 the\u00a0 evidence shall be considered as regards\u00a0 \"all the facts and circumstances of the\u00a0 case, the witnesses'\u00a0 manner of\u00a0 testifying,\u00a0 their intelligence, their means and opportunity of knowing\u00a0 the facts to which they are testifying, the nature\u00a0 of the facts to which\u00a0 they testify, the probability or improbability of their testimony, their\u00a0 interest\u00a0 or want\u00a0 of interest, and also\u00a0 their personal credibility\u00a0 so far\u00a0 as the\u00a0 same may legitimately appear upon the trial;\" of section 274, in so far as it provides that the rules\u00a0 of evidence shall be the same in all courts of the Islands,\u00a0 and upon\u00a0 every trial,\u00a0 unless otherwise expressly provided\u00a0 by statute; and of section 381, which prescribes that\u00a0 the testimony of all\u00a0 witnesses, except such as has been taken in writing in the form of <i>depositions<\/i> as otherwise provided\u00a0 by law, shall be given on oath in open court orally.\u00a0 It is\u00a0 also a singular circumstance that\u00a0 the appellant\u00a0 should claim\u00a0 to have\u00a0 proven\u00a0 his complaint by evidence which he now rejects and says was improperly\u00a0 admitted.<br\/><br\/>This\u00a0 Supreme Court,\u00a0 before which the case\u00a0 is submitted for a review of the proofs thus presented, can not even admit them; they do not constitute legal proof\u00a0 of any\u00a0 kind. It is erroneous to say that it was the duty of the court below to accept the agreements of the parties, not with respect to the facts, but as to the manner of offering their respective proofs.\u00a0\u00a0 The order of trials\u00a0 is not a personal matter between the parties, one\u00a0 that they may ignore or renounce as if it only concerned them privately.\u00a0\u00a0 The form of a trial is a matter of public order and interest.<br\/><br\/>A legal trial of the case must be held, and the judgment appealed from and all\u00a0 the proceedings, with the exception of the written allegations, are hereby set aside;\u00a0 a new trial is hereby ordered, to proceed\u00a0 from the time of the filing of the answer\u00a0 to the complaint, without any\u00a0 special ruling as to costs in this instance.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Johnson, Carson, Moreland<\/i>, and <i>Elliott, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><\/div>",

In view of such testimony and of documentary evidence, the court, on March 24, 1908, rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff-administrator for the sum of P13,606.19 and legal interest from the date of the filing of the complaint on May 24, 1906, and the costs of the trial.<br\/><br\/>Both the plaintiff and the defendant filed notice of appeal from this judgment and also asked for the annulment of the same and for a new trial, on the ground that the evidence did net justify the said judgment and that the latter was contrary to law. The defendant, on April 1, 1908, presented a written motion for a new hearing, alleging the discovery of new evidence favorable to him and which would necessarily influence the decision of this litigation, and that he was unable to discover such evidence or to introduce it at the trial of the case, notwithstanding the fact that he had used all due diligence. His petition was accompanied by affidavits from Attorney Eduardo Gutierrez Repide and Federico Hidalgo, and was granted by order of the court of the 4th of April.<br\/><br\/>At this stage of the proceedings and on August 10, 1908, the plaintiff Pena y De Ramon filed a third amended complaint, with the permission of the court, alleging, among other things, as a first cause of action, that during the period of time from November 12, 1887, to January 7, 1904, when Federico Hidalgo had possession of and administered the following properties, to wit; one house and lot at No. 48 Calle San Luis; another house and lot at No. 6 Calle Cortada; another house and lot at No. 56 Calle San Luis, and a fenced lot on the same street, all of the district of Ermita, and another house and lot at No. 81 Calle Looban de Paco, belonging to his principal, Jose de la Pena y Gomiz, according to the power of attorney executed in his favor and exhibited with the complaint under letter A, the defendant, as such agent, collected the rents and income from the said properties, amounting to P50,244, which sum, collected in partial amounts and on different dates, he should have deposited, in accordance with the verbal agreement between the deceased and himself, the defendant, in the general treasury of the Spanish Government at an interest of 5 per cent per annum, which interest on accrual was likewise to be deposited in order that it also might bear interest; that the defendant did not remit or pay to Jose de la Pena y Gomiz, during the latter's lifetime, nor to any representative of the said De la Pena y Gomiz, the sum aforestated nor any part thereof, with the sole exception of P1,289.03, nor has he deposited the unpaid balance of the said sum in the treasury, according to agreement, wherefore he has become liable to his principal and to the defendant-administrator for the said sum, together with its interest, which amounts to P72,548.24 and that, whereas the defendant has not paid over all nor any part of the last-mentioned sum, he is liable for the same, as well as for the interest thereon at 6 per cent per annum from the time of the filing of the complaint, and for the costs of the suit.<br\/><br\/>In the said amended complaint, the plaintiff alleged as a second cause of action: that on December 9, 1887, Gonzalo Tuason deposited in the general treasury of the Spanish Government, to the credit of Pena y Gomiz, the sum of 6,360 pesos, at 5 per cent interest per annum, and on December 20, 1888, the defendant, as the agent of Pena y Gomiz, withdrew the said amount with its interest, that is, 6,751.60 pesos, and disposed of the same for his own use and benefit, without having paid all or any part of the said sum to Pena y Gomiz, or to the plaintiff after the latter's death, notwithstanding the demands made upon him: wherefore the defendant now owes the said sum of 6,751.60 pesos, with interest at the rate of 5 per cent per annum, compounded annually, from the 20th of December, 1888, to the time of the filingof this complaint, and from the latter date at 6 per cent, in accordance with law.<br\/><br\/>The complaint recites as a third cause of action: that, on or about November 25, 1887, defendant's principal, Pena y Gomiz, on his voyage to Spain, remitted from Singapore, one of the ports of call, to Father Ramon Caviedas, a Franciscan friar residing in this city, the sum of 6,000 pesos with the request to deliver the same, which he did, to defendant, who, on receiving this money, appropriated it to himself and converted, it to his own use and benefit, since he only remitted to Pena y Gomiz in Spain, by draft, 737.24 pesos, on December 20, 1888; and, later, on December 21, 1889, he likewise remitted by another draft 860 pesos, without having returned or paid the balance of the said sum, notwithstanding the demands made upon him so to do: wherefore the defendant owes to the plaintiff, for the third cause of action, the sum of P4,402.76, with interest at the rate of 5 per cent per annum, compounded yearly, to the time of the filing of the complaint and with interest at 6 per cent from that date, as provided by law.<br\/><br\/>As a fourth cause of action the plaintiff alleges that, on or about January 28, 1904, on his arrival from Spain and without having any knowledge or information of. the true condition of affairs relative to the property of the deceased Pena y Gomiz and its administration, he delivered and paid to the defendant at his request the sum of P2,000, derived from the property of the deceased, which sum the defendant has not returned notwithstanding the demands made upon him so to do.<br\/><br\/>Wherefore the plaintiff petitions the court to render judgment sentencing the defendant to pay, as the first cause of action, the sum of P72,548.24, with interest thereon at the rate of 6 per cent per annum from May 24, 1906, the date of the filing of the complaint, and the costs; as a second cause of action, the sum of P15,774.19, with interest at the rate of 6 per cent per annum from the said date of the filing of the complaint, and costs; as a third cause of action, P9,811.13, with interest from the aforesaid date, and costs; and, finally, as a fourth cause of action, he prays that the defendant be sentenced to refund the sum of P2,000, with interest thereon at the rate of 6 per cent per annum from the 23d of January, 1904, and to pay the costs of trial.<br\/><br\/>The defendant, Federico Hidalgo, in his answer to the third amended complaint, sets forth: That he admits the second, third, and fourth allegations contained in the first, second, third, and fourth causes of action, and denies generally and specifically each one and all of the allegations contained in the complaint, with the exception of those expressly admitted in his answer; that, as a special defense against the first cause of action, he, the defendant, alleges that on November 18, 1887, by virtue of the powers conferred upon him by Pefia y Gomiz, he took charge of the administration of the latter's property and administered the same until December 31, 1893, when for reasons of health he ceased to discharge the duties of said position; that during the years 1889, 1890, 1891, and 1892, the defendant continually by letter requested Pena y Gomiz, his principal, to appoint a person to substitute him in the administration of the latter's property, inasmuch as the defendant, for reasons of health, was unable to continue in his trust; that, on March 22, 1894, the defendant Federico Hidalgo, because of serious illness, was absolutely obliged to leave these Islands and embarked on the steamer Isla de Luzon for Spain, on which date the defendant notified his principal that, for the reason aforestated, he had renounced his powers and turned over the administration of his property to Antonio Hidalgo, to whom he should transmit a power of attorney for the fulfillment, in due form, of the trust that the defendant had been discharging since January 1, 1894, or else execute a power of attorney in favor of such other person as he might deem proper;<br\/><br\/>That prior to the said date of March 22, the defendant came, rendered accounts to his principal, and on the date when he embarked for Spain rendered the accounts pertaining to the years 1892 and 1893, which were those that yet remained to be forwarded, and transmitted to him a general statement of accounts embracing the period from November 18, 1887, to December 31, 1893, with a balance of 6,774.50 pesos in favor of Pena y Gomiz, which remained in the control of the acting administrator, Antonio Hidalgo; that from the 22d of March, 1894, when the defendant left these Islands, to the date of his answer to the said complaint, he has not again intervened nor taken any part directly or indirectly in the administration of the property of Pena y Gomiz, the latter's administrator by express authorization having been Antonio Hidalgo, from January 1, 1894, to October, 1902, who, on this latter date, delegated his powers to Francisco Hidalgo, who in turn administered the said property until January 7, 1904; that the defendant, notwithstanding his having rendered, in 1894, all his accounts to Jose Pena y Gomiz, again rendered to the plaintiff in 1904 those pertaining to the period from 1887 to December 31, 1893, which accounts the plaintiff approved without any protest whatever and received to his entire satisfaction the balance due and the vouchers and documents relating to the property of the deceased Pena y Gomiz and issued to the defendant the proper acquittance therefor.<br\/><br\/>As a special defense to the second cause of action, the defendant alleged that, on December 9, 1886, Jose de la Pena y Gomiz himself deposited in the <i>caja general de depositos<\/i> (General Deposit Bank) the sum of 6,000 pesos, at 6 per cent interest for the term of one year, in two deposit receipts of 3,000 pesos each, which two deposit receipts, with the interest accrued thereon, amounted to 6,360 pesos, and were collected by Gonzalo Tuason, through indorsement by Pena y Gomiz, on December 9, 1887, and on this same date Tuason, in the name of Pena y Gomiz, again deposited the said sum of 6,360 pesos in the General Deposit Bank, at the same rate of interest, for the term of one year and in two deposit receipts of 3,180 pesos each, registered under Nos. 1336 and 1337; that, on December 20, 1888, Father Ramon Caviedas, a Franciscan friar, delivered to the defendant, Federico Hidalgo, by order of De la Pena y Gomiz, the said two deposit receipts with the request to collect the interest due thereon viz., 741.60 pesos and to remit it by draft on London, drawn in favor of De la Pena y Gomiz, to deposit again the 6,000 pesos in the said General Deposit Bank, for one year, in a single deposit, and in the latter's name, and to deliver to him, the said Father Caviedas, the corresponding deposit receipt and the draft on London for their transmittal to Pena y Gomiz: all of which was performed by the defendant who acquired the said draft in favor of De la Pena y Gomiz from the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, on December 20, 1888, and delivered the draft, together with the receipt from the General Deposit Bank, to Father Caviedas, and on the same date, by letter, notified Pena y Gomiz of the transactions executed; that on December 20, 1889, the said Father Ramon Caviedas delivered to the defendant, Federico Hidalgo, by order of Pena y Gomiz, the aforesaid deposit receipt from the General Deposit Bank, with the request to remit, in favor of his constituent, the interest thereon, amounting to 360 pesos, besides 500 pesos of the capital, that is 860 pesos in all, and to again deposit the rest, 5,500 pesos, in the General Deposit Bank for another year in Pena y Gomiz's own name, and to deliver to Father Caviedas the deposit receipt and the draft on London, for their transmittal to his constituent; all of which the defendant did; he again deposited the rest of the capital, 5,500 pesos, in the General Deposit Bank, in the name of Pena y Gomiz, for one year at 5 per cent interest, under registry number 3,320, and obtained from the house of J. M. Tuason &amp; Co. a draft on London for 860 pesos in favor of Pena y Gomiz, on December 21, 1889, and thereupon delivered the said receipt and draft to Father Caviedas, of which acts, when performed, the defendant advised Pena y Gomiz by letter of December 24, 1889; and that, on December 20, 1890, the said Father Ramon Caviedas delivered to the defendant, by order of Pefia y Gomiz, the said deposit receipt for 5,500 pesos with the request that he withdraw from the General Deposit Bank the capital and accrued interest, which amounted all together to 5,775 pesos, and that he deliver this amount to Father Caviedas, which he did, in order that it might be remitted to Pena y Gomiz.<br\/><br\/>The defendant denies each of the allegations contained in the third cause of action, and avers that they are all false and calumnious.<br\/><br\/>He likewise makes a general and specific denial of all the allegations of the fourth cause of action.<br\/><br\/>As a counterclaim the defendant alleges that Jose Pena y Gomiz owed and had not paid the defendant, up to the date of his death, the sum of 4,000 pesos, with interest at 6 per cent per annum, and 3,600 pesos, without interest, the said capital and interest amounting all together, on January 15, 1904, to 11,000 pesos, and on the plaintiff's being presented with the receipt subscribed by his father, Pena y Gomiz, on the said date of January 15th, and evidencing his debt, plaintiff freely and voluntarily offered to exchange for the said receipt another document executed by him, and transcribed in the complaint. Defendant further alleges that, up to the date of his counterclaim, the plaintiff has not paid him the said sum, with the exception of 2,000 pesos. Wherefore the defendant prays the court to render judgment absolving him from the complaint with the costs against the plaintiff, and to adjudge that the latter shall pay to the defendant the sum of 9,000 pesos, which he still owes to defendant, with legal interest thereon from the date of the counterclaim, to wit, May 21, 1907, and to grant s.uch other and further relief as may be just and equitable.<br\/><br\/>On the 25th of September, 1908, and subsequent dates, the new trial was held; oral testimony was adduced by both parties, and the documentary evidence was attached to the record of the proceedings, which show that the defendant objected and took exception to the introduction of certain oral and documentary evidence produced by the plaintiff. On February 26, 1909, the court in deciding the case found that the defendant, Federico Hidalgo, as administrator of the estate of the deceased Pena y Gomiz, actually owed the plaintiff, on the date of the filing of the complaint, the sum of f\u00bb37,084.93; that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover any sum whatever from the defendant for the alleged second, third, and fourth causes of action; that the plaintiff actually owed the defendant, on the filing of the complaint, the sum of P10,155, which the defendant was entitled to deduct from the sum owing by him to the plaintiff. Judgment was therefore entered against the defendant, Federico Hidalgo, for the payment of P26,629.93, with interest thereon at the rate of 6 per cent per annum from May 23, 1906, and the costs of the trial.<br\/><br\/>Both parties filed written exceptions to this judgment and asked, separately, for its annulment and that a new trial be ordered, on the grounds that the findings of fact contained in the judgment were not supported nor justified by the evidence produced, and because the said judgment was contrary to law, the defendant stating in writing that his exception and motion for a new trial referred exclusively to that part of the judgment that was condemnatory to him. By order of the 10th of April, 1909, the motions made by both parties were denied, to which they excepted and announced their intention to file their respective bills of exceptions.<br\/><br\/>By a written motion of the 24th of March, 1909, the plaintiff prayed for the execution of the said judgment, and the defendant being informed thereof solicited a suspension of the issuance of the corresponding writ of execution until his motion for a new trial should be decided or his bill of exceptions for the appeal be approved, binding himself to give such bond as the court might fix. The court, therefore, by order of the 25th of the same month, granted the suspension asked for, conditioned upon the defendants giving a bond, fixed at ?34,000 by another order of the same date, to guarantee compliance with the judgment rendered should it be affirmed, or with any other decision that might be rendered in the case by the Supreme Court. This bond was furnished by the defendant on the 26th of the same month.<br\/><br\/>On April 16 and May 4, 1909, the defendant and the plaintiff filed their respective bills of exceptions, which were certified to and approved by order of May 8th and forwarded to the clerk of this court.<br\/><br\/>Before proceeding to examine the disputed facts and to make such legal findings as follow from a consideration of the same and of the questions of law to which such facts give rise, and for the purpose of avoiding confusion and obtaining the greatest clearness and an easy comprehension of this decision, it is indispensable to premise: First, that, as before related, the original and first complaint filed by the plaintiff was drawn against Federico Hidalgo, Antonio Hidalgo, and Francisco Hidalgo, the three persons who had successively administered the property of Jose de la Pena y Gomiz, now deceased; but afterwards the action was directed solely against Federico Hidalgo, to the exclusion of the other defendants, Antonio and Francisco Hidalgo, in the second and third amended complaints, the latter of the date of August 10, 1908, after the issuance by the court of the order of April 4th of the same year, granting the new trial solicited by the defendant on his being notified of the ruling of the 24th of the previous month of March; second, that the administration of the property mentioned, from the time its owner left these Islands and returned to Spain, lasted from November 18, 1887, to January 7, 1904; and third, that, the administration of the said Federico, Antonio, and Francisco Hidalgo, having lasted so long, it is necessary to divide it into three periods in order to fix the time during which they respectively administered De la Pena's property: During the first period, from November 18, 1887, to December 31, 1893, the property of the absent Jose de la Pena y Gomiz was administered by his agent, Federico Hidalgo, under power of attorney; during the second period, from January 1, 1894, to September, 1902, Antonio Hidalgo administered the said property, and during the third period, from October, 1902, to January 7, 1904, Francisco Hidalgo was its administrator.<br\/><br\/>Before Jose de la Pena y Gomiz embarked for Spain, on November 12, 1887, he executed before a notary a power of attorney in favor of Federico Hidalgo, Antonio L. Rocha, Francisco Roxas and Isidro Llado, so that, as his agents, they might represent him and administer, in the order in which they were appointed, various properties he owned and possessed in Manila. The first agent, Federico Hidalgo, took charge of the administration of the said property on the 18th of November, 1887.<br\/><br\/>After Federico Hidalgo had occupied the position of agent and administrator of De la Pena's property for several years, the former wrote to the latter requesting him to designate a person who might substitute him in his said position in the event of his being obliged to absent himself from these Islands, as one of those appointed in the said power of attorney had died and the others did not wish to take charge of the administration of their principal's property. The defendant, Hidalgo, stated that his constituent, Pena y Gomiz, did not even answer his letters, to approve or object to the former's accounts, and did not appoint or designate another person who might substitute the defendant in his administration of his constituent's property. These statements were neither denied nor proven to be untrue by the plaintiff, Pena y de Ramon, nor does the record show any evidence tending to disapprove them, while it does show, attached to the record and exhibited by the defendant himself, several letters written by Hidalgo and addressed to Pena y Gomiz, which prove the said statements, and also a letter from the priest Pedro Gomiz, a relative of the deceased Jose de la Pena y Gomiz, addressed to Federico Hidalgo, telling the latter that the writer had seen among the papers of the deceased several letters from the agent, Federico Hidalgo, in which the latter requested the designation of a substitute, because he had to leave this country for Spain, and also asked for the approval or disapproval of the accounts of his administration which had been transmitted to his constituent, Pena y Gomiz.<br\/><br\/>For reasons of health and by order of his physician, Federico Hidalgo was obliged, on March 22, 1894, to embark for Spain, and, on preparing for his departure, he rendered the accounts of his administration corresponding to the last quarters, up to December 31, 1893, not as yet transmitted, and forwarded them to his constituent with a general statement of all the partial balances, which amounted to the sum total of 6,774.50 pesos, by letter of the date of March 22, 1894, addressed to his principal, Pena y Gomiz. In this letter the defendant informed the latter of the writer's intended departure from this country and of his having provisionally turned over the administration of the said property to his cousin, Antonio Hidalgo, upon whom the writer had conferred a general power of attorney, but asking, in case that this was not sufficient, that Pena send to Antonio Hidalgo a new power of attorney.<br\/><br\/>This notification is of the greatest importance in the decision of this case. The plaintiff avers that he found no such letter among his father's papers after the latter's death, for which reason he did not have it in his possession, but on the introduction of a copy thereof by the defendant at the trial, it was admitted without objection by the plaintiff (p. 81 of the record); wherefore, in spite of the denial of the plaintiff and of his averment of his not having found the said original among his father's papers, justice demands that it be concluded that this letter of the 22d of March, 1894, was sent to, and was received by Jose de la Pena y Gomiz, during his lifetime, for its transmittal, with inclosure of the last partial accounts of Federico Hidalgo's administration and of the general resume of balances, being affirmed by the defendant, the fact of the plaintiff's having found among his deceased father's papers the said resume which he exhibited at the trial, shows conclusively that it was received by the deceased, as well as the letter of transmittal of the 22d of March, 1894, one of the several letters written by Hidalgo, which the said priest, Father Gomiz, affirms that he saw among the papers of the deceased Pena, the dates of which ran from 1890 to 1894; and it is also shown by the record that the defendant Hidalgo positively asserted that the said letter of March was the only one that he wrote to Pena during the year 1894: From all of which it is deduced that the constituent, Pena y Gomiz, was informed of the departure of his agent from these Islands for reasons of health and because of the physician's advice, of the latter's having turned over the administration of the property to Antonio Hidalgo, and of his agent's, the defendant's, petition that he send a new power of attorney to the substitute.<br\/><br\/>The existence, among the papers of the deceased, of the aforementioned statement of all accounts rendered, which comprise the whole period of the administration of the property of the constituent by the defendant, Federico Hidalgo, from November 18, 1887, to December 31, 1893\u00a0\u00a0 a statement transmitted with the last partial accounts which were a continuation of those already previously received - and the said letter of March 22, 1894, fully prove that Jose de la Pena y Gomiz also received the said letter, informed himself of its contents, and had full knowledge that Antonio Hidalgo commenced to administer his property from January of that year. They likewise prove that he did not see fit to execute a new power of attorney in the latter's favor, nor to appoint or designate a new agent to take charge of the administration of his property that had been abandoned by the defendant, Federico Hidalgo.<br\/><br\/>From the procedure followed by the agent, Federico Hidalgo, it is logically inferred that he had definitely renounced his agency and that the agency was duly terminated, according to the provisions of article 1732 of the Civil Code, because, although in the said letter of March 22, 1894, the word \"renounce\" was not employed in connection with the agency or power of attorney executed in his favor, yet when the agent informs his principal that for reasons of health and by medical advice he is about to depart from the place where he is exercising his trust and where the property subject to his administration is situated, abandons the property, turns it over to a third party, without stating when he may return to take charge of the administration, renders accounts of its revenues up to a certain date, December 31, 1893, and transmits to his principal a general statement which summarizes and embraces all the balances of his accounts since he began to exercise his agency to the date when he ceased to hold his trust, and asks that a power of attorney in due form be executed and transmitted to another person who substituted him and took charge of the administration of the principal's property, it is then reasonable and just to conclude that the said agent expressly and definitely renounced his agency, and it may not be alleged that the designation of Antonio Hidalgo to take charge of the said administration was that of a mere provisional substitution during said agent's absence, which indeed lasted for more than fifteen years, for such an allegation would be in conflict with the nature of the agency.<br\/><br\/>This renouncement was confirmed by the subsequent procedure, as well of the agent as of the principal, until the latter died, on August 2, 1902, since the principal Pena did not disapprove the designation of Antonio Hidalgo, nor did he appoint another, nor send a new power of attorney to the same, as he was requested to do by the previous administrator who abandoned his charge; and the trial record certainly contains no proof that the defendant, since he left these Islands in March, 1894, until January, 1904, when he returned to this city, took any part whatever, directly or even indirectly, in the said administration of the principal's property, while Antonio Hidalgo was the only person who was in charge of the aforementioned administration of De la Pena y Gomiz's property and the one who was to represent the latter in his business affairs, with his tacit consent. From all of which it is perfectly concluded, (unless there be proof to the contrary, and none appears in the record), that Antonio Hidalgo acted in the matter of the administration of the property of Jose de la Pena y Gomiz by virtue of an implied agency derived from the latter, in accordance with the provisions of article 1710 of the Civil Code.<br\/><br\/>The proof of the tacit consent of the principal, Jose de la Pena y Gomiz, the owner of the property administered - a consent embracing the essential element of a legitimate agency, article 1710 before cited consists in that Pe\u00f1a, knowing that on account of the departure of Federico Hidalgo from the Philippines for reasons of health, Antonio Hidalgo took charge of the administration of his property, for which Federico, his agent, who was giving up his trust, requested him to send a new power of attorney in favor of the said Antonio Hidalgo, nevertheless he, Jose de la Pena y Gomiz, saw fit not to execute nor transmit any power of attorney whatever to the new administrator of his property and remained silent for nearly nine years; and, in that the said principal, being able to prohibit the party designated, Antonio Hidalgo, from continuing in the exercise of his position as administrator, and being able to appoint another agent, did neither the one nor the other. Wherefore, in permitting Antonio Hidalgo to administer his property in this city during such a number of years, it is inferred, from the procedure and silence of the owner thereof, that he consented to have Antonio Hidalgo administer his property, and in fact created in his favor an implied agency, as the true and legitimate administrator.<br\/><br\/>Antonio Hidalgo administered the aforementioned property of De la Pena y Gomiz, not in the character of business manager, but as agent by virtue of an implied agency vested in him by its owner who was not unaware of the fact, who knew perfectly well that the said Antonio Hidalgo took charge of the administration of that property on account of the obligatory absence of his previous agent for whom it was an impossibility to continue in the discharge of his duties.<br\/><br\/>It is improper to compare the case where the owner of the property is ignorant of the officious management of the third party, with the case where he had perfect knowledge of the management and administration of the same, which administration and management, far from being opposed by him was indeed consented to by him for nearly nine years, as was done by Pena y Gomiz. The administration and management, by virtue of an implied agency, is essentially distinguished from the management of another's business, in this respect, that while the former originates from a contract, the latter is derived only from a qausi-contract. The implied agency is founded on the lack of contradiction or opposition, which constitutes simultaneous agreement on the part of the presumed principal to the execution of the contract, while in the management of another's business there is no simultaneous consent, either express or implied, but a fiction or presumption of consent because of the benefit received.<br\/><br\/>The distinction between an agency and a business management has been established by the jurisprudence of the supreme court (of Spain) in its noteworthy decision of the 7th of July, 1881, setting up the following doctrine:<br\/><blockquote>\"That laws 28 and 32, title 12, Partida 3, refer to the expenses incurred in things not one's own and without power of attorney from those to whom they belong, and therefore the said laws are not applicable to this suit where the petition of the plaintiff is founded on the verbal request made to him by the defendant or the latter's employees to do some hauling, and where, consequently, questions that arise from a contract that produces reciprocal rights and duties can not be governed by the said laws.\"<\/blockquote>It being absolutely necessary for Federico Hidalgo to leave this city and abandon the administration of the property of his principal, Pena y Gomiz, for reasons of health, he made delivery of the property and of his administration to Antonio Hidalgo and gave notice of what he had done to his constituent, Pena, in order that the latter might send a new power of attorney to Antonio Hidalgo, the person charged with the administration of the property. Pena y Gomiz did not send the power of attorney requested, did not oppose or prohibit Antonio Hidalgo's continuing to administer his property, and consented to his doing so for nearly nine years. Consequently the second administrator must be considered as a legitimate agent of the said principal, as a result of the tacit agreement on the latter's part, and the previous agent, who necessarily abandoned and ceased to hold his position, as completely free and clear from the consequences and results of the second administration, continued by a third party and accepted by his principal; for it is a fact, undenied nor even doubted, that the said first administrator had to abandon the country and the administration of Pena's property for reasons of health, which made it impossible for him to continue in the discharge of his duties without serious detriment to himself, his conduct being in accordance with the provisions of article 1736 of the Civil Code.<br\/><br\/>In the power of attorney executed by Pena y Gomiz in this city on November 12, 1887, in favor of, among others, Federico Hidalgo, no authority was conferred upon the latter by his principal to substitute the power or agency in favor of another person; wherefore the agent could not, by virtue of the said power of attorney, appoint any person to substitute or relieve him in the administration of the principal's property, for the lack of a clause of substitution in the said instrument authorizing him so to do.<br\/><br\/>The designation of Antonio Hidalgo was not made as a result of a substitution of the power of attorney executed by Pena in favor of the defendant, but in order that the principal's property should not be abandoned, inasmuch as, for the purposes of the discharge of the duties of administrator of the same, the agent, who was about to absent himself from this city, requested his principal to send to the party, provisionally designated by the former, a new power of attorney, for the reason that the general power of attorney which Federico Hidalgo had left, executed in favor of his cousin Antonio Hidalgo, was so executed in his own name and for his own affairs, and not in the name of Pena y Gomiz, as the latter had not authorized him to take such action.<br\/><br\/>If the owner of the property provisionally administered at the time by Antonio Plidalgo, saw fit to keep silent, even after having received the aforesaid letter of March 22, 1894, and during the lapse of nearly ten years, without countermanding or disapproving the designation of the person who took charge of the administration of his property, knowing perfectly well that his previous agent was obliged, by sickness and medical advice to leave this city where such property was situated, he is not entitled afterwards to hold amenable the agent who had to abandon this country for good and valid reasons, inasmuch as the latter immediately reported to his principal the action taken by himself and informed him of the person who had taken charge of the administration of his property, which otherwise would have been left abandoned. From the time of that notification the agent who, for legitimate cause, ceased to exercise his trust, was free and clear from the results and consequences of the management of the person who substituted him with the consent, even only a tacit one, of the principal, inasmuch as the said owner of the property could have objected to, could have prohibited the continuance in the administration thereof, of the party designated by his agent, and could have opportunely appointed another agent or mandatory of his own confidence to look after his property, and if he did not do so, he is obliged to abide by the consequences of his negligence and abandonment and has no right to claim damages against his previous agent, who complied with his duty and did all that he could and ought to have done, in accordance with the law.<br\/><br\/>The defendant Federico Hidalgo, having ceased in his administration of the property belonging to Pena y Gomiz, on account of physical impossibility, which cessation he duly reported to his principal and also informed him of the person who relieved him as such administrator, and for whom he had requested a new power of attorney, is only liable for the results and consequences of his administration during the period when the said property was in his charge, and therefore his liability can not extend beyond the period of his management, as his agency terminated by the tacit or implied approval of his principal, judging from the latter's silence in neither objecting to nor in anywise prohibiting Antonio Hidalgo's continuing to administer his property, notwithstanding the lapse of the many years since he learned by letter of the action taken by his previous agent, Federico Hidalgo.<br\/><br\/>Moreover, this latter, in announcing the termination of his agency, transmitted the last partial accounts that he had not rendered, up to December 31, 1893, together with a general statement of all the resulting balances covering the period of his administration, and Jose de la Pena y Gomiz remained silent and offered no objection whatever to the said accounts and did not manifest his disapproval of the same nor of the general statement, which he must have received in April or May, 1894, up to the time he died, in August, 1902; and when his son, the plaintiff, came to this city in company with the defendant, Federico Hidalgo, they traveled together from Spain and arrived in Manila during one of the early days of January, 1904, the former, for the purpose of taking charge of the estate left by his father, and after the plaintiff had examined the accounts kept by Federico Hidalgo, his deceased father's first agent, he approved them and therefore issued in favor of the defendant the document, Exhibit 5, found on page 936 of the second record of trial, dated January 15, 1904, in which Jose de la Pena y de Ramon acknowledged having received from his deceased father's old agent the accounts, balances, and vouchers to his entire satisfaction, and gave an acquittance in full settlement of the administration that had been commended to the defendant Hidalgo.<br\/><br\/>This document, written in the handwriting of the plaintiff, Pena y de Ramon, appears to be executed in a form considered to be sufficient by its author, and, notwithstanding the allegations of the said plaintiff, the record contains no proof of any kind of Federico Hidalgo's having obtained it by coercion, intimidation, deceit, or fraud; neither is it shown to have been duly impugned as false, criminally or civilly, for the statements therein made by the plaintiff are too explicit and definite to allow, without proof of some vice or defect leading to nullification, of its being considered as void and without value or legal effect.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the responsibility contracted by the defendant, as regards the payment of the balance shown by the accounts rendered by him, it is not enough that the agent should have satisfactorily rendered the accounts pertaining to his trust, but it is also indispensable that it be proved that he paid to his principal, or to the owner of the property administered, the balance resulting from his accounts, This balance, which was allowed in the judgment appealed from, notwithstanding the allegations of the plaintiff, whjch were not deemed as established, amounts to P6,774.50, according to the proofs adduced at the trial. It was the imperative duty of the administrator, Federico Hidalgo, to transmit this sum to his principal, Jose de la Pena y Gomiz, as the final balance of the accounts of his administration, struck on December 31, 1893, and by his failure so to do and his delivery of the said sum to his successor, Antonio Hidalgo, he acted improperly, and must pay the same to the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>Antonio Hidalgo took charge of the administration of Pena y Gomiz's property from January, 1894, to September, 1902, that fs, during the second period of administration of the several properties that belonged to the deceased Pena.<br\/><br\/>Although the plaintiff, in his original complaint, had included the said Antonio Hidalgo as one of the responsible defendants, yet he afterwards excluded him, as well from the second as from the third amended complaint, and consequently the liability that might attach to Antonio Hidalgo was not discussed, nor was it considered in the judgment of the lower court; neither can it be in this decision, for the reason that the said Antonio Hidalgo is not a party to this suit. However, the said liability of Antonio Hidalgo is imputed to Federico Hidalgo, and so it is that, in the complaint, the claim is made solely against Federico Hidalgo, in order that the latter might be adjudged to pay the amounts which constitute the balance owing from him who might be responsible, Antonio Hidalgo, during the period of this latter's administration.<br\/><br\/>Federico Hidalgo, in our opinion, could not and can not be responsible for the administration of the property that belonged to the deceased Pena y Gomiz, which was administered by Antonio Hidalgo during eight years and some months, that is, during the second period, because of the sole fact of his having turned over to the latter the administration of the said property on his departure from this city for Spain. Neither law nor reason obliged Federico Hidalgo to remain in this country at the cost of his health and perhaps of his life, even though he were the administrator of certain property belonged to Pena y Gomiz, since the care of the property and interests of another does not require sacrifice on the part of the agent of his own life and interests. Federico Hidalgo was obliged to deliver the said property belonging to Pena y Gomiz to Antonio Hidalgo, for good and valid reasons, and in proceeding in the manner aforesaid he complied with the duty required of him by law and justice and acted as a diligent agent. If the principal, Jose de la Pena y Gomiz, the owner of the property mentioned, although informed opportunely of what had occurred saw fit to keep silent, not to object to the arrangements made, not to send the power of attorney requested by Federico Hidalgo in favor of Antonio Hidalgo, and took no action nor made any inquiry whatever to ascertain how his property was being administered by the second agent, although to the time of his death more than eight years had elapsed, the previous agent, who ceased in the discharge of his duties, can in nowise be held liable for the consequences of such abandonment, nor for the results of the administration of property by Antonio Hidalgo, for the reason that, since his departure from this country, he has not had the least intervention nor even indirect participation in the aforementioned administration of the said Antonio Hidalgo who, under the law, was the agent or administrator by virtue of an implied agency, which is equivalent in its results to an express agency, executed by the owner of the property. Consequently, Federico Hidalgo is not required to render accounts of the administration corresponding to the second period mentioned, nor to pay the balance that such accounts may show to be owing.<br\/><br\/>At the first trial of this cause, Federico Hidalgo, it appears, testified under oath that his principal, Jose Pena y Gomiz, did not agree to the appointment of Antonio Hidalgo, chosen by the witness, nor to such appointee's taking charge' of the administration of his property. Aside from the fact that the trial record does not show how nor on what date Pena expressed such disagreement, it is certain that, in view of the theory of defense maintained by the defendant in this suit and his own denial of his having given such a negative answer, we fail to understand how the defendant Hidalgo could have said, by means of a no, that his principal did not agree to the appointment of the said Antonio Hidalgo, and the intercalation of the word no in the statement quoted is the more inexplicable in that the attorney for the adverse party moved that the said answer be striken from the record, as he objected to its appearing therein.<br\/><br\/>Were it true that the principal, Jose de la Pena y Gomiz, had neither agreed to the designation of Antonio Hidalgo, nor to the latter's administering his property, he would immediately have appointed another agent and administrator, since he knew that Federico Hidalgo had left the place where his property was situated and tjiat it would be abandoned, had he not wished that Antonio Hidalgo should continue to administer it. If the latter continued in the administration of the property for so long a time, nearly nine years, it was because the said Pena agreed and gave his consent to the acts performed by his outgoing agent, and for this reason the answer given by Federico Hidalgo, mistakenly, or not, that his principal, Pena, did not agree to the appointment of Antonio Hidalgo, is immaterial and does not affect the terms of this decision.<br\/><br\/>If the defendant is not responsible for the results of the administration of the said property administered by Antonio Hidalgo during the second period before referred to, neither is he responsible for that performed during the third period by Francisco Hidalgo, inasmuch as the latter was not even chosen by the defendant who, on October 1, 1902, when Francisco Hidalgo took charge of Peiia's property that had been turned over to him by Antonio Hidalgo, was in Spain and had no knowledge of nor intervention in such delivery: wherefore the defendant can in no manner be obliged to pay to the plaintiff any sum that may be found owing by Francisco Hidalgo.<br\/><br\/>The trial judge\u00a0 taking into consideration that, by the evidence adduced at the hearing, it was proved that Francisco Hidalgo rendered accounts to the plaintiff of the administration of the property in question during the said third period, that is, for one year, three months, and some days, and that he delivered to the plaintiff the balance of 1,280.03 pesos, for which the latter issued to the said third administrator the document Exhibit 2, written in his own handwriting under date of January 7, 1904, and the signature which, affixed by himself, he admitted in his testimony was authentic, on its being exhibited to him found that the plaintiff, Pena y de Ramon, was not entitled to recover any sum whatever for the rents pertaining to the administration of his property by the said Francisco Hidalgo.<br\/><br\/>All the reasons hereinbefore given relate to the first cause of action, whereby claim is made against Federico Hidalgo for the payment of the sum of P72,548.24 and interest at the rate of 6 per cent per annum, and they have decided some of the errors assigned by the appellants in their briefs to the judgment appealed from.<br\/><br\/>Two amounts are claimed which have one and the same origin, yet are based on two causes of action, the second and the third alleged by the plaintiff; and although the latter, afterwards convinced by the truth and of the impropriety of his claim, had to waive the said third cause of action during the second hearing of this cause (pp. 57 and 42 of the record of the evidence), the trial judge, on the grounds that the said second and third causes of action refer to the same certificates of deposit of the treasury of the Spanish Government, found, in the judgment appealed from, that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover anything for the aforesaid second and third causes of action - a finding that is proper and just, although qualified as erroneous by the plaintiff in his brief.<br\/><br\/>It appears, from the evidence taken in this cause, that Jose de la Pena y Gomiz, according to the certificate issued by the chief of the division of archives (p. 982 of the record), did not again during his lifetime, after having in 1882 withdrawn from the General Deposit Bank of the Spanish Government a deposit of 17,000 pesos and its interest, deposit any sum therein until December 9, 1886, when he deposited two amounts of 3,000 pesos each, that is, 6,000 pesos in all, the two deposit receipts for the same being afterwards endorsed in favor of Gonzalo Tuason. The latter, on December 9, 1887, withdrew the deposit and took out the said two amounts, together with the interest due thereon, and on the same date redeposited them in the sum of 6,360 pesos at 5 per cent per annum in the name of Jose de la Pena y Gomiz. On the 20th of December of the following year, 1888, the defendant Hidalgo received from his principal, Pena y Gomiz, through Father Ramon Caviedas, the two said letters of credit, in order that he might withdraw from the General Deposit Bank the two amounts deposited, together with the interest due thereon, amounting to 741 pesos, and with this interest purchase a draft on London in favor of its owner and then redeposit the original capital of 6,000 pesos. This, the defendant Hidalgo did and then delivered the draft and the deposit receipt to Father Caviedas, of all of which transactions he informed his principal by letter of the same date, transcribed on page 947 of the second trial record.<br\/><br\/>In the following year, 1889, Father Ramon Caviedas again delivered to the defendant Hidalgo the aforementioned deposit receipt with the request to withdraw from the General Deposit Bank the sum deposited and to purchase a draft of 860 pesos on London in favor of their owner, Jose de la Pena y Gomiz, and, after deducting the cost of the said draft from the capital and interest withdrawn from deposit, amounting to 6,360 pesos, to redeposit the remainder, 5,500 pesos, in the bank mentioned, in accordance with the instructions from Pena y Gomiz: All of which was done by the defendant Hidalgo, who delivered to Father Caviedas the receipt for the new deposit of 5,500 pesos as accredited by the reply-letter, transcribed on page 169 of the record, and by the letter addressed by Hidalgo to Pena, of the date of December 20 of that year and shown as an original exhibit by the plaintiff himself on page 29 of the record of the evidence.<br\/><br\/>Lastly, in December, 1890, Father Caviedas, aforementioned, delivered to the defendant Hidalgo the said deposit receipt for 5,500 pesos in order that he might withdraw this amount from deposit and deliver it with the interest thereon to the former for the purpose of remitting it by draft to Jose de la Pena; this Hidalgo did, according to a reply-letter from Father Caviedas, the original of which appears on page 979 of the file of exhibits and is copied on page 171 of the trial record, and is apparently confirmed by the latter in his sworn testimony.<br\/><br\/>So that the two amounts of 3,000 pesos each, expressed in two deposit receipts received from De la Pena y Gomiz by Father Ramon Caviedas and afterwards delivered to Francisco Hidalgo for the successive operations of remittance and redeposit in the bank before mentioned, are the same and only ones that were on deposit in the said bank in the name of their owner, Pena y Gomiz. The defendant Hidalgo made two remittances by drafts on London, one in 1888 for 741.60 pesos, through a draft purchased from the Chartered Bank, and another in 1889 for 860 pesos, through a draft purchased from the house of Tuason &amp; Co., and both in favor of Pena y Gomiz, who received through Father Ramon Caviedas the remainder, 5,500 pesos, of the sums deposited. For these reasons, the trial judge was of the opinion that the certificates of deposit sent by Pena y Gomiz to Father Ramon Caviedas and those received from the latter by the defendant Hidalgo were identical, as were likewise the total amounts expressed by the said receipts or certificates of deposit, from the sum of which were deducted the amounts remitted to Pena y Gomiz and the remainder deposited after each annual operation until, finally, the sum of 5,500 pesos was remitted to its owner, Pena y Gomiz, according to his instructions, through the said Father Caviedas. The lower court, in concluding its judgment, found that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover any sum whatever for the said second and third causes of action, notwithstanding that, as hereinbefore stated, the said plaintiff withdrew the third cause of action. This finding of the court, with respect to the collection of the amounts of the aforementioned deposit receipts, is perfectly legal and in accordance with justice, inasmuch as it is sustained by abundant and conclusive documentary evidence, which proves in an incontro-vertible manner the unrighteousness of the claim made by the plaintiff in twice seeking payment, by means of the said second and third causes of action, of the same sum which, after various operations of deposit and remittance during three years, was finally returned with its interest to the possession of its owner, Pena y Gomiz.<br\/><br\/>From the trial had in this case, it also appears conclusively proved that Jose de la Pena y Gomiz owed, during his lifetime, to Federico Hidalgo, 7,600 pesos, 4,000 pesos of which were to bear interest at the rate of 6 per cent per annum, and the remainder without any interest, and that, notwithstanding the lapse of the period of three years, from November, 1887, within which he bound himself to repay the amount borrowed, and in spite of his creditor's demand of payment, made by registered letter, the original copy of which is on page 38 of the file of exhibits and a transcription thereof on page 930 of the first and second record of the evidence, the debt was not paid up to the time of the debtor's death. For such reasons, the trial court, in the judgment appealed from, found that there was a preponderance of evidence to prove that this loan had been made and that the plaintiff actually owed the defendant the sum loaned, as well as the interest thereon, after deducting therefrom the 2,000 pesos which the defendant received from the plaintiff on account of the credit, and that the former was entitled to recover.<br\/><br\/>It appears from the pleadings and evidence at the trial that in January, 1904, on the arrival in this city of Federico Hidalgo and the plaintiff, Jose de la Pena y de Ramon, and on the occasion of the latter's proceeding to examine the accounts previously rendered, up to December 31, 1893, by the defendant Hidalgo to the plaintiff's father, then deceased, Hidalgo made demand upon the plaintiff, Pena y de Ramon, for the payment of the said debt of his father, although the creditor Hidalgo acceeded to the requests of the plaintiff to grant the latter an extension of time until he should be able to sell one of the properties of the estate. It was at that time, according to the defendant, that the plaintiff\u00a0 Pena took\u00a0 up\u00a0 the\u00a0 instrument of\u00a0 indebtedness, executed by his deceased father during his lifetime, and delivered to the defendant in exchange therefor the document of the date of January 15, 1904, found on page 924 of the second record of evidence, whereby the plaintiff, Jose de la Pena, bound himself to pay his father's debt of 11,000 pesos, owing to the defendant Hidalgo, out of the proceeds of the sale of some one of the properties specified in the said document, which was written and signed by the plaintiff in his own handwriting.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff not only executed the said document acknowledging his father's debt and binding himself to settle it, but also, several days after the sale of a lot belonging to the estate, paid to the creditor on account the sum of 2,000 pesos, according to the receipt issued by the latter and exhibited on page 108 of the first record of evidence. The said document, expressive of the obligation contracted by the plaintiff, Pena y de Ramon, that he would pay to the defendant the debt of plaintiff's deceased father, amounting to 11,000 pesos, out of the proceeds from some of the properties of the estate, has not been denied nor impugned as false; and notwithstanding the averment made by the plaintiff that when he signed he lacked information and knowledge of the true condition of the affairs concerning Hidalgo's connection with the property that belonged, to De la Pena's father, it can not be denied that absolutely no proof whatever is shown in the trial record of the creditor's having obtained the said document through deceit or fraud circumstances in a certain manner incompatible with the explicit statements contained therein. For these reasons, the trial court, weighing the whole of the evidence furnished by the record, found that the loan of the said 7,600 pesos was truly and positively made, and that the plaintiff must pay the same to the defendant, with the interest thereon, and that he was not entitled to recover the 2,000 pesos, as an undue payment made by him to the defendant creditor. For the foregoing reason the other errors assigned by the plaintiff to the judgment appealed from are dismissed.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the obligation to pay the interest due on the amounts concerned in this decision, it must be borne in mind that, as provided by article 1755 of the Civil Code, interest shall only be owed when it has been expressly stipulated, and that should the debtor, who is obliged to pay a certain sum of money, be in default and fail to fulfill the agreement made with his creditor, he must pay, as indemnity for losses and damages, should there not be a stipulation to the contrary, the interest agreed upon, and should there be no express stipulation, the legal interest (art. 1108 of the Civil Code); but, in order that the debtor may be considered to be in default and obliged to pay the indemnity, it is required, as a general rule, that his creditor shall demand of such debtor the fulfillment of his obligation, judicially or extrajudicially, except in such cases as are limitedly specified in article 1100 of the Civil Code.<br\/><br\/>It was not expressly stipulated that either the balance of the last account rendered by the defendant Federico Hidalgo in 1893, or the sum which the plaintiff bound himself to pay to the defendant, in the instrument of the 15th of January, 1904, should bear interest; nor is there proof that a judicial or extrajudicial demand was made, on the part of the respective creditors concerned, until the date of the complaint, on the part of the plaintiff, and that of the counterclaim, on the part of the defendant. Therefore no legal interest is owing for the time prior to the respective dates of the complaint and counterclaim.<br\/><br\/>By virtue, then, of the reasons hereinbefore set forth, it is proper, in our opinion, to adjudge, as we do hereby adjudge, that the defendant, Federico Hidalgo, shall pay to the plaintiff, Jose de la Pena y de Ramon, as administrator of the estate of the deceased Jose de la Pena y Gomiz, the sum of P6,774.50, and the legal interest thereon at the rate of 6 per cent per annum from the 23d of May, 1906, the date of the filing of the original complaint in this case; that we should and hereby do declare that the said defendant, Federico Hidalgo, is not bound to give nor render accounts of the administration of the property of the said deceased Jose de la Pena y Gomiz, administered, respectively, by Antonio Hidalgo, from January, 1894, to September 80, 1902, and by Francisco Hidalgo, from October 1, 1902, to January 7, 1904, and therefore the defendant, Federico Hidalgo, not being responsible for the results of the administration of the said property administered by the said Antonio and Francisco Hidalgo, we do absolve the said defendant from the complaint filed by the plaintiff, in so far as it concerns the accounts pertaining to the aforesaid two periods of administration and relates to the payment of the balances resulting from such accounts; and that we should and hereby do absolve the defendant Hidalgo from the complaint with respect to the demand for the payment of the sums of P15,774.19 and P2,000, with their respective interests, on account of the second and the fourth cause of action, respectively, and, because the plaintiff renounced and withdrew his complaint, with respect to the third cause of action; and that we should and do likewise adjudge, that the plaintiff, Jose de la Pena y de Ramon, shall pay to Federico Hidalgo, by reason of the counterclaim, the sum of P9,000 with legal interest thereon at the rate of 6 per cent per annum from the 21st of May, 1907, the date of the counterclaim.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from, together with that part thereof relative to the statement it contains concerning the equivalence between the Philippine peso and the Mexican peso, is affirmed in so far as it is in agreement with the findings of this decision, and the said judgment is reversed in so far as it is not in accordance herewith. No special finding is made as to costs assessed in either instance, and to the plaintiff is reserved any right that he may be entitled to enforce against Antonio Hidalgo.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C J., Johnson, Moreland, <\/i>and <i>Trent, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><\/div>",

he got up and opened the window to see who it was, and saw standing\u00a0 in\u00a0 front of his house two\u00a0 individuals who asked him to allow them to pass the night in the house; he thereupon struck a light and\u00a0 opened the door at\u00a0 the top of the staircase, and inquired who they were, to which one of the men\u00a0 answered that his name was Miguel.\u00a0 At this moment, as the owner of the house, the lieutenant of the barrio, sought to recognize the stranger, another man, who was already\u00a0 upstairs alongside the staircase, struck Labitoria on the forehead with a wooden stick;\u00a0 as a result of the attack, the latter fell backward over a bench inside the house, and the aggressor, who turned out to be Toribio Abanto, passed\u00a0 through the door and threw himself upon Labitoria, seizing him by the throat; at this, Urbano Quiambao, who was staying in the house that\u00a0 night, seeing what was taking\u00a0 place, caught up a stick of <i>palma brava <\/i>which he used for\u00a0 carrying his stock of drygoods, and struck\u00a0 the aggressor with it.\u00a0\u00a0 As a result of the struggle that\u00a0 ensued between\u00a0 the three, Toribio Abanto fell wounded\u00a0 to\u00a0 the ground, and after some time he was picked up by order of the justice of the peace, to whom Marcos Labitoria reported the affair, and the wounded aggressor was\u00a0 carried in a hammock to the town.<br\/><br\/>For\u00a0 these reasons the provincial fiscal filed a complaint on the 11th of\u00a0 February, 1909, with the Court of First Instance of Lucena, charging Toribio Abanto with the crime of forcible\u00a0 entry of a\u00a0 dwelling.\u00a0 Proceedings were instituted, and the trial judge entered judgment on the same date, sentencing\u00a0 the defendant to the penalty of five years of <i>prision correccional,<\/i> to the accessory penalties, to pay a fine of 1,000 pesetas, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and costs.\u00a0 From the said judgment the\u00a0 defendant has\u00a0 appealed.<br\/><br\/>Article 491 of the Penal Code reads :<br\/><blockquote>\"Any private individual who shall enter another's dwelling against the will of the tenant thereof shall be punished with <i>arresto mayor<\/i> and a fine of from 325 to 3,250 pesetas.<br\/><br\/>\"If the deed were committed with violence\u00a0 or intimidation, the penalties shall be prision correctional in its medium and maximum degree and a fine of from 325 to 3,250 pesetas.\"<\/blockquote>The facts related and\u00a0 fully proven in the present\u00a0 case constitute the crime of forcible entry of a dwelling, defined and punished by paragraph 2 of the foregoing article, inasmuch, as on the night in question the defendant forcibly entered the house of Macario Labitoria; taking advantage of the fact that the house owner opened the door and put his head outside to ascertain who were the two persons\u00a0 that were asking shelter, Abanto suddenly, and without reason, struck Labitoria a heavy blow on the forehead\u00a0 with a stick (<i>garrote<\/i>) and when the\u00a0 assaulted man fell over a bench inside his house,\u00a0 the\u00a0 aggressor passed through the open door and repeated the assault, grasping the latter, who had fallen over said bench, by the neck.\u00a0 Thanks to the assistance rendered\u00a0 by the guest, Urbano Quiambao, Labitoria fared no worse, nor was the accused Abanto, as prearranged with his two companions\u00a0 who remained outside the house, able to accomplish his ulterior purpose,\u00a0 It is probable that the latter did not dare enter the house upon hearing or observing the effective defense\u00a0 offered by the owner of the house and his guest, Quiambao.<br\/><br\/>The circumstance that the dpor of the house was already open and that there was\u00a0 no\u00a0 previous express opposition or prohibition on the part of the owner thereof to the entry of the defendant is no bar to the qualification of the crime ; in order that the crime of forcible entry of a dwelling may be considered\u00a0 as\u00a0 having\u00a0 been\u00a0 perpetrated,\u00a0 it is not an essential requisite that the door of the house should be closed; even if it were open, so long as the entry of a person is\u00a0 opposed or prohibited by the tenant, the crime is committed if said individual introduces himself therein against the express will of its tenant.<br\/><br\/>Paragraph 2 of the above-cited article\u00a0 is applicable\u00a0 in this case, it having been fully proven that the defendant Abanto entered the house of the injured party in a violent manner, and\u00a0 assaulted\u00a0 the\u00a0 latter from the\u00a0 door to the interior of his house, and in view of such behavior it is not necessary that\u00a0 express opposition or prohibition on the part of the tenant should have preceded the forcible entry.\u00a0\u00a0 Even in a semicivilized country it must be supposed that a person entering a house\u00a0 with violence and maltreating the tenant, as stated herein before, would not obtain the tacit nor express consent of the latter.<br\/><br\/>The defendant pleaded not guilty,\u00a0 and,\u00a0 notwithstanding his allegations, not only unsupported by proof, but notoriously false and contrary to his own\u00a0 testimony in another case instituted\u00a0 against Mateo Lacuarin and Isaac de Ocampo, who accompanied him on the night in question,\u00a0 these proceedings furnish evidence conclusive\u00a0 beyond all reasonable doubt of his guilt as the sole principal of the crime herein prosecuted.\u00a0 In the proceedings alluded to, brought against said persons for attempted robbery, the defendant Abanto testified that by order of\u00a0 the latter, he called\u00a0 to the injured party from the street and asked him for lodging,\u00a0 and that when the door of the house was opened, he being near it, was at once maltreated\u00a0 by\u00a0 the inmates of the same, and not by\u00a0 reason of the gambling that was going on therein; Ms testimony\u00a0 in these proceedings is, therefore, false, being not only contrary to his former allegation, but contradicted by the\u00a0 injured party and his house companion.<br\/><br\/>In the commission oi the crime herein the trial judge has rightly\u00a0 considered\u00a0 the\u00a0 aggravating circumstance of nocturnity, for the reason that it was perpetrated at a late hour\u00a0 and in the\u00a0 silence\u00a0 of night, without any mitigating circumstance to lessen its effects.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 penalty of<i> prision correccional in<\/i>\u00a0 its medium and maximum degrees, as fixed by the code, should be imposed upon\u00a0 him in the maximum degree.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing\" reasons, and as the judgment appealed from is in accordance with the\u00a0 law and the merits of the case, it is our opinion that the same should be and is hereby affirmed, with the costs against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered,<br\/><br\/><i> Arellano, C.

Fernando, with\u00a0 respect to a portion of the said land, comprising 8 hectares, 18 ares and 8 centares, which she alleged was hers and which was included within the area of the land that was the subject of the application.<br\/><br\/>The applicants derive their right and title of ownership from\u00a0 Luis Saenz de Vizmanos,\u00a0 who sold them the whole of the said land on September 7, 1904.\u00a0\u00a0 De Vizmanos acquired the land through title by composition\u00a0 from the state on April 17, 1893.\u00a0 This title, as well as that of purchase and sale, was recorded in the property registry of the Province of Bulacan, the former\u00a0 on June 2, 1893, and the latter on September 7, 1904.<br\/><br\/>Petrona Fernando also\u00a0 invokes a similar title by composition\u00a0 from the state, obtained on\u00a0 March\u00a0 17,\u00a0 1895, and recorded in the property registry of the province mentioned on September 19, 1896.<br\/><br\/>Prior to the time when the vendor, Saenz de\u00a0 Vizmanos, obtained his title by composition from the state, he was already in possession of the whole of the land therein specified, through its award to him, as it appears, in a suit against Timoteo de Pano, decided\u00a0 in his favor.\u00a0 This previous possession was confirmed by the witnesses on both sides in that litigation.\u00a0 Saenz de Vizmanos testified that Vicente Enriquez, the former husband\u00a0 of Petrona Fernando, begged the witness, after the termination of the suit against Timoteo de Pano, to give him the parcel of land which is now in contention,\u00a0 and that, as they were friends, he gave it to him.\u00a0 When questioned as to whether he had transferred the\u00a0 ownership or only the usufruct, he replied\u00a0 \"the ownership of\u00a0 the land.\"\u00a0 On cross-examination he was asked whether he had told Juana Gatmaitan, one of the applicants, that the portion transferred was only in usufruct, and he denied having made such a statement.\u00a0\u00a0 He affirmed that the\u00a0 sale\u00a0 mentioned in the\u00a0 public instrument presented\u00a0 in evidence by\u00a0 the applicants\u00a0 was executed by him in their favor; but he said that on the contract of purchase and sale being presented to him, he made the remark that the portion belonging to\u00a0 Petrona\u00a0 (the\u00a0 opponent)\u00a0 should\u00a0 be excluded from the sale, to which Juana Gatmaitan replied that there was no need to set forth the fact in\u00a0 the instrument, because she, Gatmaitan, had a lease\u00a0 on that portion and, moreover, Petrona was her aunt.\u00a0 De Vizmanos further testified that he\u00a0 made the\u00a0 same statement to the notary, but that the latter told him that there was no need of such an exclusion, as there was already a contract with the said Petrona.\u00a0\u00a0 On being questioned by the judge, he stated that he had signed the application for the composition title twenty years before and had\u00a0 transferred the land to Vicente Enriquez\u00a0 thirty years before,\u00a0 and that thirty years had elapsed\u00a0 since the termination of the suit with Timoteo de Pano; so that, as admitted by this witness, the transfer had already been made at\u00a0 the time that he applied for his composition title for the whole of the land.<br\/><br\/>One of the applicants, Juana Gatmaitan, testified\u00a0 that in June, 1904, she leased from Petrona S. Fernando the portion of land concerned in\u00a0 this litigation, that is, four months before purchasing it from Saenz de Vizmanos.<br\/><br\/>The statements made by the seller,\u00a0 Saenz de Vizmanos, in his testimony, contrary to those\u00a0 contained in the public instrument of sale executed\u00a0 by him in favor of the applicants, and the lapse of more than thirty years of possession by the opponent, not less than the title of ownership obtained by the latter from the state eighteen years before, induced the\u00a0 trial judge to declare the title by composition of Saenz de Vizmanos null, in so far as it\u00a0 concerned the portion of land in dispute, which portion in fact he no longer possessed on the date he applied for the said title, and to decide this suit in favor\u00a0 of the opponent.\u00a0\u00a0 The court below decreed that \"the registration solicited is denied with respect to the disputed portion of the land, described in opponent's petition (L. D. 3145) and plan, Exhibit B, which is declared to belong to the opponent, Petrona Sepulveda Fernando.\"<br\/><br\/>The applicants appealed from\u00a0 this judgment and\u00a0 forwarded to this court a bill of exceptions,\u00a0 with right\u00a0 to a review of the evidence, containing the following allegations of error:<br\/><br\/>First.\u00a0 The court\u00a0 erred in finding, on the sole testimony of Saenz de Vizmanos, that the latter had\u00a0 thirty years before transferred to Vicente Enriquez, the\u00a0 opponent's\u00a0 husband, the portion of land in question.<br\/><br\/>Second. The court erred\u00a0 in finding that the land which is the subject of the opposition\u00a0 was not included\u00a0 in the sale made by Saenz de Vizmanos.<br\/><br\/>Third. The court erred in giving, weight\u00a0 to the testimony of a witness in so far as it was not rebutted.<br\/><br\/>Fourth. The court erred in declaring the.\u00a0 nullity\u00a0 of the title issued by the state in\u00a0 favor of Saenz de Vizmanos.<br\/><br\/>Fifth.\u00a0 The court erred in declaring the validity\u00a0 of the title issued by the state in favor of the opponent.<br\/><br\/>Sixth.\u00a0 The court erred by not declaring valid the sale executed by Saenz de Vizmanos in favor of the\u00a0 applicants.<br\/><br\/>The first error\u00a0 alleged\u00a0 was not committed.\u00a0 The\u00a0 important fact is the transfer made by Vizmanos to the\u00a0 husband of the opponent, Vicente Enriquez,\u00a0 and this fact is admitted by the applicants in their brief,\u00a0 under No. 2 of the enumeration of the facts that they admit as proved.\u00a0 The period of thirty years, as found in the judgment appealed from, in\u00a0 accordance with the testimony of\u00a0 the witness\u00a0 Vizmanos, is of no importance\u00a0 in this suit,\u00a0 inasmuch as no defense of prescription, neither ordinary nor extraordinary, was argued or alleged therein.<br\/><br\/>The second\u00a0 error alleged is not without foundation, but it does not invalidate the judgment.\u00a0 Certainly, it was improper to consider in the judgment appealed from,\u00a0 as a ground for the decision, the'testimony of Saenz de Vizmanos to the effect that he did not wish to include in the sale made to the applicants the portion of land which is now the subject of opposition.\u00a0 According to the context of the instrument,\u00a0 it is included therein, and no one\u00a0 has denied nor may deny the fact; and because now the vendor desires\u00a0 by his testimony to\u00a0 invalidate and\u00a0 annul the sale which\u00a0 he is shown in that instrument solemnly to have made, no greater weight can be given to his\u00a0 subsequent testimony, as against the previous execution of the deed of sale, on the hypothesis that the contents of a contract are not at the mercy\u00a0 of one of the contracting parties, as regards its effects, unless it be to one's own detriment, but not to that of the other party, nor in favor of or against a third person.\u00a0 Moreover, it has in no\u00a0 manner been proven - for the sole testimony\u00a0 of the vendor is not proof that can prejudice the purchasers - that either the latter, or the\u00a0 notary who authorized the instrument,\u00a0 was cautioned with\u00a0 respect to the exclusion of any portion whatever of the land the whole of which appears in the said instrument as sold.<br\/><br\/>It is a fact fully substantiated that Saenz de Vizmanos sold to the petitioners all of the land which is at present the subject of their\u00a0 application.\u00a0\u00a0 But it has been conclusively proved, beyond all peradventure of doubt, that he could not have and ought not to have sold all the land specified in the instrument of sale; and for this reason,\u00a0 that\u00a0 finding, although it may appear erroneous, does not vitiate the judgment appealed from.\u00a0 On the part of the vendor it has been fully proved,\u00a0 by\u00a0 his own testimony given at the trial,\u00a0 that thirty\u00a0 years before he transferred\u00a0 to Vicente Enriquez the ownership, not the usufruct, of the portion of land in question, and that this transfer was made before Vizmanos had applied for and\u00a0 received the title by composition from the state,\u00a0 in 1893.\u00a0 Consequently, the\u00a0 said portion could not have been included in that application, nor\u00a0 in that title, being as it was then a thing belonging to another, neither could it be transferred by the vendor, in 1904, in favor of the applicants.\u00a0\u00a0 The result is that he knowingly sold\u00a0 a thing which was not his, by including the said portion of land as a part of the whole tract sold.\u00a0 He knowingly sold a thing belonging to another, for it is improper for him to allege that he was not aware that it had already been registered in\u00a0 the\u00a0 registry of land\u00a0 by the\u00a0 opponent herein. With respect to the purchasers, there is the fact that one of them, before the\u00a0 purchase\u00a0 of the said\u00a0 portion from Vizmanos, had leased it from the opponent; and the lessee not having proved at the trial that she had accepted it from the opponent in the Iatter's capacity\u00a0 as a mere\u00a0 usufructuary, it is to be supposed, by\u00a0 the\u00a0 ordinary\u00a0 rules\u00a0 for the\u00a0 interpretation of contracts, that in\u00a0 taking\u00a0 the lease from the opponent she recognized her as\u00a0 the owner of the land; so that, knowing that the opponent\u00a0 was then the owner of the land, instead of buying it from her,\u00a0 she\u00a0 bought it from Vizmanos who, thirty years ago, ceased to be the owner of that portion by reason of his having transferred the ownership thereof to the husband of the opponent.\u00a0\u00a0 And whether there was or was not knowledge of this right of ownership\u00a0 which, as a general rule, the contract of lease implies, it is a proven fact that it is the opponent who possessed the said portion of land as owner, and against this right of ownership the sale, the basis\u00a0 of the application, was effected.<br\/><br\/>When, on the 7th of September, 1904, the applicants purchased the whole of the land from Vizmanos, they could and ought to have seen by the property registry that the said portion\u00a0 of land was\u00a0 shown therein to belong to\u00a0 Petrona Fernando, through title by composition obtained in\u00a0 March, 1895,\u00a0 and\u00a0 recorded on September 19,\u00a0 1896.\u00a0\u00a0 Hence,,\u00a0 the title of\u00a0 ownership, which\u00a0 the applicants\u00a0 believe they have acquired by the alleged\u00a0 contract of purchase and sale, can not be affirmed, for it clearly appears that the vendor could not have transmitted to them an ownership which for many years\u00a0 he no longer had, at least not since the opponent, without opposition on his\u00a0 part, had acquired from the state a solid title by\u00a0 composition.<br\/><br\/>It appears from the\u00a0 property registry that the land registered as belonging absolutely to the opponent is bounded on the north and south by land belonging to Saenz de Vizmanos, and, as shown by the plan presented by the opponent and according to its unquestionable location admitted at the trial, it is surrounded on all\u00a0 sides, across\u00a0 several\u00a0 esteros, by the rest of the land\u00a0 previously registered as the property of Saenz de Vizmanos.<br\/><br\/>During the course of the proceedings in the matter of the application\u00a0 of Petrona Fernando for the composition title, necessarily Saenz de Vizmanos should have\u00a0 been summoned, and then and only then, as this court has decided\u00a0 in several cases, arose Saenz de Vizmanos's opportunity to object to the registration, as property belonging to\u00a0 Petrona Fernando, of the land which he considered to be his own, for any of the reasons now alleged, not by Saenz de Vizmanos but by those who are merely his successors in interest.\u00a0 For a successor in interest to invoke a\u00a0 right as one derived from his predecessor which the latter did not and could not have and does not and\u00a0 can not invoke,\u00a0 is indeed invoking a great deal. Unhesitatingly, Saenz de Vizmanos testified that thirty years ago he transferred to Vicente Enriquez,\u00a0 in turn predecessor in interest of Petrona Fernando, the land now in litigation, and conveyed\u00a0 not merely the usufruct, but also the ownership.\u00a0 And\u00a0 not because\u00a0 he so testified\u00a0 must\u00a0 the land he considered as\u00a0 belonging to Petrona Fernando, but because her ownership is plainly shown by the property registry as against Saenz de Vizmanos and whomsoever may claim to derive his right from Saenz de Vizmanos.\u00a0 If the latter can in no manner invalidate the title of ownership registered in favor of Petrona Fernando, still less are\u00a0 the petitioners able to do\u00a0 so,\u00a0 who\u00a0 simply invoke a right which\u00a0 they suppose to lie with Saenz de Vizmanos and which\u00a0 the\u00a0 latter does not claim to have possessed in 1904 when he executed the instrument of sale of the whole of the land which he continued to\u00a0 possess at the\u00a0 place aforementioned, in\u00a0 the center of which land is situated the property in litigation.<br\/><br\/>It is consequently needless to consider the other assignments of error alleged, the gro.unds of the judgment appealed from having been herein\u00a0 sufficiently established.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, the said judgment is affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellants.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Johnson, Carson,<\/i> and <i>Moreland, JJ.,<\/i> concur.<br\/><\/div>",

It is urged by the Attorney- General, who appears as counsel for the respondents, that:<br\/><ol><li>The complainant has no such beneficial interest in the act which he seeks to have performed or restrained as to make him a proper party to these proceedings and entitle him to maintain the same;<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>That this court has no jurisdiction to control by mandamus or injunction the official acts of the Governor-General, the head of the executive department of the Philippine Government; and,<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>That the official act which the complainant seeks to have performed, and also the official act which he seeks to have restrained, are acts which are left to the discretion of the Governor-General, and as such are not subject to the control of the court.<\/li><\/ol>The complainant, Lope Severino, is a private individual of the Philippine Islands. The only allegation in the petition which tends to show (aside from the fact that he is a duly qualified elector and citizen of the Philippine Islands) that he is a proper party to these proceedings is that he is the local chief of the <i>Nacionalista <\/i>party in the town of Silay. He has no authority by statute, or otherwise, to represent the public. The only provision in the Election Law which refers in any manner to political parties is found in section 15. This section deals exclusively with the appointment of election inspectors and provides that, should there be in any municipality one or more political parties, or branches thereof, which shall have polled 30 per cent, or over, of the votes cast at the preceding general election, then two inspectors shall belong to the party which polled the largest number of votes, and the other shall belong to the party which polled the next largest number. The complainant does not allege that the local party which he represents polled 30 per cent, or over, of the votes cast for municipal president, or any other office, at the preceding general election.<br\/><br\/>Should the Governor-General appoint a president of the municipality of Silay and fail to call a. special election, if any injury should result it would be of a public nature and the complainant would suffer no substantial injury different from that suffered by the public at large. So his status as complainant in these proceedings is that of a private citizen of the town of Silay. Therefore, we shall inquire into the question as to whether or not, admitting that the writs might issue, Lope Severino is a proper complainant. This question has been before the courts of the United States frequently and the decisions upon the same are not uniform. Some of the courts hold that an individual citizen is not entitled to institute proceedings in mandamus against public officers to compel the performance of a public duty, unless such citizen shows some specific or peculiar interest in himself different from that shared by the public at large, and in such cases the relief should be sought in the name of the public and by its legal representative.<br\/><br\/>It the case of Mitchell <i>vs.<\/i> Boardman (79 Me:, 469), the court held that -<br\/><blockquote>\"A writ of mandamus will be granted to a private individual only in those cases where he has some private or particular interest to be subserved, or some particular right to be protected, independent of that which he holds in common with the public at large. It is for the public officers exclusively to apply for the writ when public rights are to be subserved.\"<\/blockquote>This same rule has been announced and followed in the case ,of Sanger <i>vs<\/i>. Kennebec County Com'rs. (25 Me., 291) ; Bobbet <i>vs.<\/i> State (10 Kan., 9); Commonwealth <i>vs<\/i>. Park (9 Phila., 481); Linden <i>vs<\/i>. Alameda County Sup'rs. (45 Cal., 6); People <i>vs.<\/i> State Prison (4 Mich., 187); and O'Brien <i>vs.<\/i> Members of the Board of Aldermen of Pawtucket (18 R. I., 113). Other decisions might be cited in support of this doctrine.<br\/><br\/>On the other hand, High, in his work on Extraordinary Legal Remedies, third edition, section 431, says:<br\/><blockquote>\"As regards the degree of interest on the part of the relator requisite to make him a proper party on whose information the proceedings may be instituted, a distinction is taken between cases where the extraordinary aid of a mandamus is invoked merely for the purpose of enforcing or protecting a private right, unconnected with the public interest, and cases where the purpose of the application is the enforcement of a purely public right, where the people at large are the real party in interest. And while the authorities are somewhat conflicting, yet the decided weight of authority supports the proposition that, when the relief is sought merely for the protection of private rights, the relator must show some personal or special interest in the subject-matter, since he is regarded as the real party in interest and his right must clearly appear. Upon the other hand, when the question is one of public right and the object of the mandamus is to procure the enforcement of a public duty, the people are regarded as the real party in interest, and the relator at whose instigation the proceedings are instituted need not show that he has any legal or special interest in the result, it being sufficient to show that he is a citizen and as such interested in the execution of the laws.\" (Citing numerous cases.)<\/blockquote>In the case of Hamilton, Auditor of Marion County, <i>vs.<\/i> State, on relation of Bates (3 Ind., 451), the court, after stating the facts, said (p. 458):<br\/><blockquote>\"Were this a case merely for private relief, the relator would have to show some special interest in the subject- matter. But here the case is different. The defendant, who was county auditor, refused to issue the legal duplicate for the collection of the taxes and a mandamus was applied for to compel him to discharge this duty of his office. It is a case for the enforcement, not of a private, but of a public right; and it is not necessary, in such cases, that the relator should have a special interest in the matter, or that he should be a public officer. That the defendant should discharge, correctly, the duties of his office, was a matter in which Bates, as a citizen of the county, had a general interest; and that interest was, of itself, sufficient to enable him to obtain, the mandamus in question.\"<\/blockquote>In the case of the State of Ohio, <i>ex rel<\/i>. Trauger, <i>vs<\/i>. Nash, Governor (6Q Ohio St., 612), the complainant alleged that he was an elector, citizen, taxpayer, and the owner in fee simple of real estate in the city of Columbus, State of Ohio; that the defendant, Nash, was the duly elected, qualified, and acting governor of the State; that on May 2, 1902, the duly elected and qualified lieutenant-governor resigned, thereby creating a vacancy in the office of lieutenant-governor; and that it was the duty of the defendant, as governor, under the provisions of sections 11 and 81 of the revised statutes of the State, to appoint an elector of the State of Ohio to fill the vacancy in the office of lieutenant-governor. The court in passing upon the question as to whether or not the complainant, Trauger, was the proper party to institute these proceedings, said (p. 615) : \"It may be conceded that a majority of the courts which have pronounced opinions on the subject have held that a private relator applying for a mandamus must show a special interest in himself; but even in some of those jurisdictions it has been said that 'the rule which rejects the intervention of the private complainants against public grievances is one of discretion and not of law,' \" citing Ayres <i>vs<\/i>. Board of State Auditors (42 Mich., 422) ; Railroad Co. <i>vs.<\/i> Hall et al. (91 U. S., 343) ; Railroad Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Suffern et al. (129 111., 274); State,<i> ex rel<\/i> Currie, et al.,<i> vs<\/i>. Weld County Auditor (39 Minn., 426) ; State <i>vs.<\/i> Brown (38 Ohio St., 344) and State, <i>ex rel., vs.<\/i> Tanzey<i> et <\/i>al. (49 Ohio St., 656).<br\/><br\/>In the case of Ayres <i>vs.<\/i> Board of State Auditors,<i> supra,<\/i> the court said (pp. 429, 430):<br\/><blockquote>\"In the present case the officer whose duty it usually is to enforce the rights of the State, in this court, has, in the performance of his official functions as adviser of the State officers, placed himself in an adverse position, and appears for the respondents on this application. Inasmuch, then, as the attorney-general refuses to appear and seek the enforcement of the statutory provision, does his refusal preclude its enforcement? And if not, is the relator authorized to bring the matter before this court?<br\/><br\/>\"There may perhaps be others who have interests that would justify their appearance, but there is no one else whose duty it is to appear where the attorney-general declines to do so.<br\/><center><br\/>* \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0* \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/><br\/><\/center> \"There are serious objections against allowing mere in- terlopers to meddle with the affairs of the State, and it is not usually allowed unless under circumstances where the public injury by its refusal will be serious. * * * But we find no reason to consider the matter as one lying outside of judicial discretion, which is always involved in mandamus cases concerning the relief as well as other questions.\"<\/blockquote>In the case of Railroad Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Hall et al.<i>, supra<\/i>, the Supreme Court of the United States said:<br\/><blockquote>\"There is, we think, a decided preponderance of American authority in favor of the doctrine that private persons may move for a mandamus to enforce a public duty, not due to the Government as such, without the intervention of the Government law officer.\"<\/blockquote>Paragraph 2 of section 164 of the Code of Civil Procedure in force in the Philippine Islands provides that a preliminary injunction may be granted when it is established, to the satisfaction of the judge, \"that the commission or continuance of some act complained of during the litigation would <i>probably<\/i> work <i>injustice <\/i>to the plaintiff.\"<br\/><br\/>Section 222 of the same code provides that when the complaint in an action in a Court of First Instance alleges that any inferior tribunal, corporation, board, or person unlawfully neglects the performance of an act which the law especially enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station, or unlawfully excludes the plaintiff from the use and enjoyment of a right or office to which he is entitled, * * * and the court on the trial finds the allegations of the complaint to be true, it may, if there is no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary courts of law, render a judgment granting a peremptory order against the defendant to do the act required to be done to protect the rights of the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>Section 515 provides that the Supreme Court shall have concurrent jurisdiction with the Courts of First Instance in all cases where an inferior tribunal, corporation, board, or person unlawfully excludes the plaintiff from the use and enjoyment of a right or office to which he is entitled, and from which he is unlawfully excluded by such inferior tribunal, corporation, board, or person.<br\/><br\/>Under these provisions the relator, in order to obtain an injunction, must show that he is entitled to the relief demanded and that the continuance of the acts complained of or threatened to be done would probably work an injustice to the plaintiff. Also in order to obtain a mandamus he must allege and show that the respondents are excluding him from a right or office to wHich he is entitled, and that the respondents are unlawfully neglecting the performance of an act or acts which the law especially enjoins as a duty resulting from their office, trust, or station.<br\/><br\/>The relator in the case at bar alleges that he has a right conferred upon him by statute to participate in the selection of the president of the town of Silay; that the respondents are attempting to deprive him of this right by appointing a president and refusing to call a special election. It is true, as we have stated, that the right which he seeks to enforce is not greater or different from that of any other qualified elector in the municipality of Silay. It is also true that the injury which he would suffer in case he fails to obtain the relief sought would not be greater or different from that of the other electors; but he is seeking to enforce, a public right as distinguished from a private right.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The real party in interest is the public, or the qualitied electors of the town of Silay. Each elector has the same right and would suffer the same injury. Each elector stands on the same basis with reference to maintaining a petition to determine whether or not the relief sought by the relator should be granted.<br\/><br\/>It is urged by counsel for the respondents that should this court hold that the relator has a sufficient right to maintain this proceeding and should grant or deny, the writs prayed for, such holding would not preclude any other qualified elector of Silay from instituting another proceeding of this same character and seeking the same relief, resulting in a multiplicity of suits and a continual annoyance to the respondents. While this may possibly be true (a question which we do not now decide), nevertheless the question as to whether or not innumerable petitions of this character would follow is a practical one and not one of law. We are not called upon to decide practical questions of this nature, but we might add that as far as the practical effect of such holding is concerned it would preclude the filing of other petitions by other electors inasmuch as should this court hold that these writs will not lie to the Governor-General, and the rights of the other parties being the same as that of the petitioner herein, it would be seen that it would be useless to institute other proceedings of the same character. On the other hand, should this court hold that the writs will lie, then it would not be necessary for any other elector or electors to move in the matter. Should they do so this court in the use of its discretionary power could deny such petitions without a hearing.<br\/><br\/>We have examined the cases wherein the courts of the United States have held that private individuals are not proper parties in cases where a public right is to be enforced, unless such private persons have some particular interest to be subserved or some particular right to be protected independent of that which they hold in common with the public at large. In these cases the courts hold that it is for the public officers exclusively to apply for the relief when such rights are to be subserved.\u00a0\u00a0 In such cases it is the duty, by express provisions of law, of public officers to enforce such rights.<br\/><br\/>In this jurisdiction it is the duty of the Attorney-General \"to perform the duties imposed upon him by law,\" and \"he shall prosecute or defend therein all causes, civil and criminal, to which the Government of the Philippine Islands, or any officer thereof, in his official capacity, is a party.\" (Sees. 1365 and 1366 of Compilation.) The duties of the Attorney-General are expressly provided and he is not called upon to perform any other duties. He would have no authority to represent any other entities or persons in a case in which duties are not especially imposed upon him by statute. It is his duty to represent the public officer when such public officer is a party to a suit in his official capacity. The same is true of the provincial fiscals.<br\/><br\/>The Attorney-General, in compliance with the duty imposed upon him by law, appeared for the respondents in this case. It is not the duty of any law officer of the Government to appear for the relator, neither could such law officer, in his official capacity, represent the relator if he desired to do so. No express provision is found making it the duty of any official of the Government to bring these proceedings. So, if the relator is precluded from maintaining these proceedings for the purpose of having his rights passed upon by this court, these questions could not be raised.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for respondents urge that this court impliedly laid down the rule in the case of Abendan vs. Llorente (10 Phil. Rep., 216) that, where the injury complained of is really a public injury and the right violated is a public right, an individual can not maintain a suit to enforce such right unless he alleges that he would suffer a special injury and has a substantial right different from that suffered or held by the public at large. The question presented in this case is different from that presented in the case at bar. Abendan, the plaintiff in this case, brought an original action of certiorari in the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands for the purpose of having reviewed a judgment entered in the Court of First Instance of the Province of Cebu. The defendants, one of whom was the judge of that court, having been directed to show cause why the record in the case in which that judgment was entered should not be remitted to the Supreme Court and examined, appeared and objected to such an order on the ground that the plaintiff had no right to have such judgment reviewed. That case arose out of a certain election protest proceeding had in the Court of First Instance. The plaintiff, Abendan, was not a party to the said proceedings. Those proceedings were carried on exclusively between Llorente on the one hand and Vicente Sotto and Timoteo Castro on the other, Llorente protesting the election of municipal president. If Abendan cast his vote in the said election he exercised all the rights he had in the premises. The question was between the candidates as to who was entitled to hold the office of municipal president. This court in passing upon the question raised in this case said (p. 217) : \"In our opinion, this fact (referring to the fact that Abendan was a qualified elector) does not give him any standing in this court to ask for the review of that judgment. There is nothing in the complaint to show whether or not he voted at the election in question, or, if he did so vote, whether he voted for Llorente, Sotto, or Timoteo de Castro. We find nothing in the Election Law (Act No. 1582) which allows a voter who was not a candidate to take any proceedings in court to contest the legality of an election.\"<br\/><br\/>The court in this case held that a voter who was not a candidate could not take any proceeding into court to contest the legality of an election. No other question was before the court and it did not decide any other question. The question before the court in the case at bar is not one affecting the legality of an election. We now have nothing to do with any election, so far as its legality is concerned.<br\/><br\/>In the case at bar the question between the candidates was settled in the Court of First Instance and their rights as such candidates disappeared on the final determination of the case in said court. The court held that no one was legally elected municipal president and thereafter the candidates who protested that election had no greater or different right from that of any other elector, as far as the questions under consideration are concerned. The relator seeks to have the whole question returned to the municipality for determination. Any qualified elector could have become a candidate immediately upon the termination of the protest. The question is no longer just between the two candidates, but all the electors are now affected alike.<br\/><br\/>We are therefore of the opinion that the weight of authority supports the proposition that the relator is a proper party to proceedings of this character when a public right is sought to be enforced. If the general rule in America were otherwise, we think that it would not be applicable to the case at bar for the reason \"that it is always dangerous to apply a general rule to a particular case without keeping in mind the reason for the rule, because, if under the particular circumstances the reason for the rule does not exist, the rule itself is not applicable and reliance upon the rule may well lead to error.\"<br\/><br\/>No reason exists in the case at bar for applying the general rule insisted upon by counsel for the respondent. The circumstances which surround this case are different from those in the United States, inasmuch as if the relator is not a proper party to these proceedings no other person could be, as we have seen that it is not the duty of the law officer of the Government to appear and represent the people in cases of this character.<br\/><br\/>We are, therefore, of the opinion that the relator is a proper party to these proceedings and has a right as such to have the question <br\/><br\/>We will now proceed to determine whether or not the court has jurisdiction to control by mandamus or injunction the official acts of the Governor-General. If the Governor-General can not be compelled by a mandamus to call this special election it follows that he can not be restrained by injunction from appointing a person to fill the position of municipal president, for the nature of the act to be performed by him is precisely the same in one case as in the other, and the same considerations operate to sustain or defeat the jurisdiction of the court in both instances.<br\/><br\/>It is admitted and universally recognized that mandamus and injunction will never lie to enforce or restrain a duty which is discretionary. This proposition is elemental and it is unnecessary to cite authorities in support of the same. We believe that it is well settled in the United States that the courts will never assume jurisdiction over the official acts of the President. This question was first raised and so impliedly decided in 1803 in the case of Marbury <i>vs.<\/i> Madison (1 Cranch, 152), and was directly decided in the case of the State of Mississippi <i>vs.<\/i> Johnson (4 Wall., 475). In this latter case a motion was filed on behalf of the State of Mississippi for leave to file a bill in the name of the State praying the Supreme Court to perpetually enjoin and restrain Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, from executing, or in any manner carrying out, the Reconstruction Act. The court in passing upon this question as to whether or not in any case the President of the United States could be compelled to perform a purely ministerial act under a positive law, said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The Congress is the legislative department of the Government; the President is the executive department. Neither can be restrained in its action by the iudicial department; though the acts of both, when performed, are, in proper cases, subject to its cognizance.<br\/><br\/>\"The impropriety of such interference will be clearly seen upon consideration of its possible consequences.<br\/><br\/>\"Suppose the bill filed and the injunction prayed for allowed. If the President refuse obedience, it is needless to observe that the court is without power to enforce its process. If, on the other hand, the President complies with the order of the court and refuses to execute the acts of Congress, is it not clear that a collision may occur between the executive and legislative departments of the Government? May not the House of Representatives impeach the President for such refusal? And in that case could this court interfere, in behalf of the President, thus endangered by compliance with its mandate, and restrain by injunction the Senate of the United States from sitting as a court of impeachment? Would the strange spectacle be offered to the public world of an attempt by this court to arrest proceedings in that court?<br\/><br\/>\"These questions answer themselves. * * * We are fully satisfied that this court has no jurisdiction of a bill to enjoin the President in the performance of his official duties; and that no such bill ought to be received by us. * * * The motion for leave to file the bill is therefore, denied.\"<\/blockquote>The differentiation invoked by the courts between the President and governors of States on one hand and cabinet officials and inferior state officials on the other hand is plainly indicated in the case of Kendall vs. United States (12 Pet., 522), wherein the court used the following language:<br\/><blockquote>\"The executive power is vested in a President; and so far as his powers are derived from the Constitution, he is beyond the reach of any other department, except in the mode prescribed by the Constitution, through the impeaching power. But it by no means follows that every officer in every branch of that department is under the exclusive direction of the President. Such a principle, we apprehend, is not, and certainly can not be claimed by the President. There are certain political duties imposed upon many officers in the executive department, the discharge of which is under the direction of the President. But it would be an alarming doctrine, that Congress can not impose upon any executive officer any duty they may think proper, which is not repugnant to any rights secured and protected by the Constitution; and in such cases, the duty and responsibility grow out of and are subject to the control of the law, and not to the direction of the President. And this is emphatically the case, where the duty enjoined is of a mere ministerial character.\"<\/blockquote>The question whether governors of States in the Union are amenable to the orders of the courts in the performance of their ministerial duties has been answered in two irreconcilable lines of decisions. In one line of decisions it is held that the writ of mandamus will not lie to the governor of a State to compel the performance of any official duty, he being entirely removed from the control of the courts without regard to the question as to the nature of such duties, whether strictly executive or political, inherent in the office of governor, or purely ministerial. On the other hand, the courts, while granting the complete independence of the governors from judicial control in the performance of purely executive and political functions, have held, as to ministerial duties incumbent by law upon them, and which the legislature might with equal propriety require any other official to perform, wherein the special private right of a citizen is involved, that the writ of mandamus will lie to compel the performance of such duty.<br\/><br\/>In the case at bar counsel for the relator insists that the acts sought to be performed by the Governor-General are purely ministerial, conferred upon him by express statute and which could have been with equal propriety conferred upon other officials of the Philippine Government. Conceding, without deciding, the correctness of this proposition, we will proceed to the decision of the main question, for the proper determination of which it is necessary to notice some of the steps by which the constituted Government in the Philippine Islands was established.<br\/><br\/>The United States acquired the Philippine Islands by cession under the treaty of peace executed at Paris on December 10, 1898, between the United States and Spain, the final ratifications being exchanged on April 11, 1899. The Philippine Islands after American occupation were under military rule, prior to the creation by the President of the Philippine Commission. This military government was established by the President of the United States under his war power, exercising executive, legislative, and judicial authority, all of which he might have exercised personally or through such military or civil agents as he chose to select. The President continued to exercise his war power, as Commander in Chief of the military forces, up until March 2, 1901, the date of the approval by the President of the Spooner Amendment. Notwithstanding that the Philippine Commission had been created prior to this time with certain legislative and executive powers, the government established continued to be a military government. The Spooner Amendment did not change the form of the government which had been established by the President under his war power, but it did make a fundamental change in respect to the legal authority exercised by the President in this country. Thereafter, in the administration of civil affairs in this country, he acted in his civil capacity as President of the United States and not as Commander in Chief of the Army. From this time, legally speaking, dates the commencement of civil government. Exercising this civil authority as President of the United States, conferred upon him by the Spooner Amendment, the President proceeded to create the office of Civil Governor, which he did in June, 1901, to take effect on July 4 of the same year, on which date the Civil Governor was inaugurated. By virtue of the same power the President proceeded with the further organization of civil government by creating (September 1, 1901) four executive departments and the office of Vice-Governor (October 29,1901), and by virtue of the authority conferred upon him by the said Spooner Amendment he continued the administration of civil affairs until the Congress of the United States assumed charge July 1, 1902. In the meantime the office of Military Governor was abolished and the Civil Governor became the Executive. The instructions of the President of the United States to the Philippine Commission, dated April 7, 1900, and the Act of Congress approved July 1, 1902, now constitute the Organic Acts, by virtue of which the Civil Government was established.<br\/><br\/>The President of the United States, in the creation of civil government and the administration of civil affairs, exercised the combined powers of the Federal and State governments, and now Congress, in legislating for this country, exercises the combined legislative powers which are exercised by the Federal and State governments. The legislative power which was delegated by the President to the Philippine Commission and which was later ratified by the Congress of the United States was more comprehensive than the legislative powers now possessed by State governments.<br\/><br\/>In the Organic Act (Instructions of the President to the Philippine Commission) there were extended to the Philippine Islands and made the very foundation of our governmental system the great principles which are found in the Constitution of the United States and the constitutions of the different States. These great principles of government, as President McKinley said in his instructions, \"have been made the basis of our governmental system, which we deem essential to the rule of law and the maintenance of individual freedom, * * *; that there are also certain practical rules of government which we have found to be essential to the preservation of these great principles of liberty and law, and that these principles and these rules of government must be established and maintained in their Islands for the sake of their liberty and happiness, * * *. Upon every division and branch of the Government of the Philippines, therefore, must be imposed these inviolable rules: \"That no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law; that private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation; that in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *.\"<br\/><br\/>These fundamental principles were approved and ratified by the Congress of the United States and are now, and have been since the organization of the Philippine Commission, the law of the land, and upon them has been reared our present Civil Government in these Islands. In order to make these principles effective and considering that the American Union has always believed them essential to a republican form of government, the Philippine Commission proceeded to organize one of the great coordinate branches of the government, the judicial department, providing in section 2 of Act No. 136 that \"the judicial power of the Government of the Philippine Islands shall be vested in a Supreme Court, Courts of First Instance, and courts of justices of the peace, together with such special jurisdictions of municipal courts, and other special tribunals as now are or hereafter may be authorized by law.\" This provision was likewise affirmed and ratified by Congress.<br\/><br\/>It having become necessary in the judgment of the President of the United States, he created, as we have seen, the office of Civil Governor (Governor-General) and vested in him the executive authority in all civil affairs in the Government of the Philippine Islands, which had theretofore been exercised by the Military Governor. This order of the President was also ratified and affirmed by Congress. All the legislative power in civil affairs was vested in the Philippine Commission, which was exercised by it until the convening of the Assembly, and that legislative power is now exercised by the Philippine Legislature in all that part of the Philippine Islands not inhabited by Moros or other non-Christian tribes, the Commission still retaining its legislative power over the Moro Province and the territory inhabited by non-Christian tribes.<br\/><br\/>This government being modeled after the Federal and State governments in the United States now possesses a complete governmental organization, with executive, legislative, and judicial departments, which are exercising functions as independent of each other as the Federal or State governments.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the relator urges that the executive and legislative departments are not independent of each other, basing this contention upon the fact that the Governor-General is not only the Executive of the Philippine Islands but a member and presiding officer of the Upper House of the Philippine Legislature. It is true that the Governor-General is a member of the Upper House and presides over its deliberations, but he does not possess the veto power which is possessed by the President of the United States and every State governor. This veto power gives the Chief Executive of the United States and the chief executives of the different States greater control over the legislation than is possessed by the Governor-General of the Philippine Islands. The Governor-General has only one vote in the Philippine Legislature, while the chief executives of the Federal and State governments, exercising their veto power, can prevent enactments from becoming laws when passed by a majority of the legislative body, unless the consent of two-thirds of the members of the legislative body is obtained and the law passed over the executive's veto.<br\/><br\/>While the duties imposed upon the Governor-General of the Philippine Islands are not as great as those imposed upon the President of the United States, we think he holds a more responsible position than those held by the State governors. As a general rule the powers and duties of State governors are specifically set forth in the State constitutions and enactments. The powers and duties of the Governor-General of the Philippine Islands are not specincally stated in the Organic Acts. The Governor-General, who we think can properly be called the Executive of the Philippine Islands, is not elected by the people, but appointed by the President of the United States, with the advice and consent of the United States Senate, and he is directly responsible to the President for his official acts. No provisions are made or provided in this country for the impeachment of the Governor-General as is provided in Federal and State governments. Nevertheless, he is responsible directly to the President and indirectly to the people of the United States and of the Philippine Islands for his official acts and conduct. His recall is not so difficult to obtain as the impeachment of the President of the United States or a State governor. The Governor-General is in a way responsible for, and has direct supervision over, the provincial and municipal executive officers, although a part of them are elected by the people.\u00a0\u00a0 The election of provincial officials must be approved and confirmed by him, and he, with the advice, and consent of the Philippine Commission, may remove for just cause any of these elective provincial officials. He has the power to, and does, appoint, with the advice and consent of the Philippine Commission, the chiefs of the Insular Bureaus and their assistants, with the exception of those of Auditor and Treasurer, and may suspend or remove them for just cause. He also, under the same conditions, has the power, and does appoint, and can remove a great number of other Insular officials. In exercising his executive authority in the enforcement of the laws he does so through an unbroken chain of subordinate officials. Governors of States in the Union are not the \"executives,\" but are only the \"chief executives.\" All State officials associated with the governor, it may be said as a general rule, are, both in law and in fact, his colleagues, not his agents nor even his subordinates (except in formal rank and precedence) . They, like himself (with the exception of a few States wherein the governors have the power to appoint some State officials), are elected by the people. He is in no way concerned in their choice. They are not given him as advisers; on the contrary they are coordinated with him. As a general rule he has no power to suspend or remove them. It is true that in a few of the States the governors have power to appoint certain high officials, but they can not be removed for administrative reasons. These are exceptions to the general rule. The duties of these officials are prescribed by constitutional provisions or by statute, and not by the governor. The actual execution of a great many of the laws does not lie with the governors, but with the local officers who are chosen by the people in the towns and counties and \"bound to the central authorities of the State by no real bonds of responsibility.\" In most of the States there is a significant distinction between the State and local officials, such as county and city officials over whom the governors have very little, if any, control; while in this country the Insular and provincial executive officials are bound to the Governor-General by strong bonds of responsibility. So we conclude that the powers, duties, and responsibilities conferred upon the Governor-General are far more comprehensive than those conferred upon State governors.<br\/><br\/>Inasmuch as the three coordinated departments of the Government, the executive, legislative, and judicial, have been established and are operating, as we have said, as independently of each other as the same three coordinated branches created under the constitution of the Federal and State governments are operating in the American Union, and in view of the fact that there have been conferred upon the Chief Executive of these Islands more extensive powers, duties, and responsibilities than have been conferred upon the governors of the various States of the Union, we think the reason for the holdings of the courts of the United States, which have passed upon this question, are worthy of consideration. We might here add that we have no doubt that the present incumbent of the office of Governor-General, a man who is ready and willing at all times to render obedience to the law, would follow the mandate of this court, but such willingness to be governed by the order of this court would not of itself give us jurisdiction. Nor should he manifest (which he has not done) his intention to not obey the mandate of this court, this would not be sufficient reason for us to abstain from requiring him to comply with such mandate in case we have jurisdiction.<br\/><br\/>The question as to whether or not the courts have jurisdiction to control the official acts of the governor has been before a great many courts of the States in the Union. We shall not attempt to examine all of these cases. Among those which support the proposition that the courts of the States have no jurisdiction are the following: Hawkins <i>vs.<\/i> The Governor - mandamus -\u00a0 (1 Ark., 570) ; The State, ex ret, <i>vs<\/i>. Drew, Governor - mandamus - (17 Fla., 67); Low <i>vs<\/i>. Towns, Governor - mandamus - (8 Ga., 360) ; The People, ex rel., <i>vs.<\/i> Bissell, Governor - mandamus - (19 111., 229) ; The People, ex rel., <i>vs<\/i>. Yates, Governor - mandamus -\u00a0 (40 111., 126) ; The People, ex rel, <i>vs.<\/i> Cullom, Governor -\u00a0 mandamus - (100 111., 472); The State <i>vs<\/i>. Warmoth, Governor - mandamus - (22 La. Ann., 1); Dennet, petitioner, <i>vs<\/i>. The Governor - mandamus - (32 Me., 508) , The People <i>vs<\/i>. The Governor - mandamus - (29 Mich., 320); Rice <i>vs.<\/i> Austin, Governor - mandamus - (19 Minn., 74); Western Rid. Co. <i>vs<\/i>. De Graff - mandamus - (27 Minn., 1) ; Vicksburg Rid. Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Lowry, Governor - mandamus - (61 Miss., 102) ; The State <i>vs.<\/i> The Governor - mandamus - (39 Mo., 388); The State <i>vs.<\/i> Price, Governor - mandamus - (1 Dutcher (N. J.), 331); Hartranft's Appeal - contempt - (85 Pa. St., 433); Mauran vs. Smith, Governor - mandamus -\u00a0 (8 R. I., 192); Turnpike Co. <i>vs.<\/i> Brown, Governor - mandamus - (8 Baxt. (Tenn.), 490).<br\/><br\/>And the cases which support the proposition that the courts can compel the governors to perform purely ministerial duties are the following;<br\/><br\/>Tenn., etc., Rid. Co. vs. More, Governor - mandamus - (36 Ala., 371); Middleton <i>vs.<\/i> Low, Governor - mandamus = (30 Cal., 596) ; Harpending <i>vs.<\/i> Haight, Governor - mandamus -\u00a0 (39 Cal., 189); Wright, Governor,<i> vs<\/i>. Nelson - mandamus -\u00a0 (6 Ind., 496); Baker, Governor, <i>vs.<\/i> Kirk - mandamus - (33 Ind., 517); Gray, Governor, <i>vs.<\/i> The State - mandamus -\u00a0 (72 Ind., 567); Magruder <i>vs.<\/i> Swann, Governor - mandamus - (25 Md., 173); Groome, Governor, <i>vs.<\/i> Gwinn - mandamus - (43 Md., 572 ; Chamberlain <i>vs<\/i>. Sibley, Governor -\u00a0 mandamus\u00a0 - (4 Minn., 309); Chumasero <i>vs<\/i>. Potts, Governor - mandamus - (2 Mont., 242); Wall<i> vs.<\/i> Blasdel, Gov- ernor - mandamus - (4 Nev., 241); Cotton <i>vs.<\/i> Ellis, Governor - mandamus - \u2014(7 Jones (N. C.) Law, 545); The State vs. Chase, Governor - mandamus - (5 Ohio St., 528).<br\/><br\/>One of the foremost cases supporting the last proposition is that of State, ex ret Whiteman et al. <i>vs.<\/i> Governor (5 Ohio St., 528), decided in 1856. In this case the court said (p. 534):<br\/><blockquote>\"That each of these coordinate departments (executive, legislative, and judicial) has duties to perform in which it is not subject to the controlling or directing authority of either of the others, must be conceded.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But this independence arises not Mn the grade of the officer performing the duties, but the nature of the authority exercised. Under our system of government, no officer is placed above the restraining authority of the law, which is truly said to be universal in its behests - 'all paying it homage, the least as feeling its care, and the greatest as not exempt from its power.' And it is only where the law has authorized it, that the restraining power of one of these coordinate departments can be brought to operate as a check upon one of the others.<br\/><center><br\/>*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*<br\/><\/center> <br\/>\"While the authority of the governor is <i>supreme<\/i> in the exercise of his political and executive functions which depend on the exercise of his own judgment or discretion, the authority of the judiciary of the State is <i>suprem<\/i>e in the determination of all legal questions involved in any matter judicially brought before it. Although the State can not be sued, there is nothing in the nature of the office of govnor which prevents the prosecution of a suit against the person engaged in discharge of its duties. This is fully sustained by the analogy of the doctrine of the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of Marbury <i>vs.<\/i> Madison (1 Cranch, 170).\"<\/blockquote>The court in this case incorporated into its decision the words of Chief Justice Marshall in the case of Marbury <i>vs.<\/i> Madison as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"It is not by the office of the person to whom the writ is directed, <i>but the nature of the thing to be done<\/i>, that the propriety or impropriety of issuing a mandamus is to be determined.\"<\/blockquote>These words of the great Chief Justice have frequently been cited by the courts and are considered as authoritative in support of the last proposition.<br\/><br\/>In the case of Marbury <i>vs.<\/i> Madison,<i> supra<\/i>, a rule was granted requiring the Secretary of State, Mr. Madison, to show cause why a mandamus should not be issued, directing him to deliver to William Marbury his commission as justice of the peace for the County of Washington, in the District of Columbia. No cause having been shown, the case came on by motion for a mandamus. The court discussed and decided three questions:<br\/><ol><li>\u00a0Had the applicant a right to the commission he demanded?<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>If he had such right and that right had been violated, would the laws of his country afford him a remedy?<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>If they would afford him a remedy was it a mandamus issuing from that court?<\/li><\/ol>That court held that Marbury had been duly and regularly appointed justice of the peace and that the appointment conferred upon him a legal right to the office; that having this legal title to the office he had a consequent right to the commission, further holding that a refusal to deliver the commission was a plain violation of the appellant's right for which the laws of his country afforded him a remedy. The case went off on a jurisdictional question and the writ was denied.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The Act to establish the judicial courts of the United States authorizes the Supreme Court 'to issue writs of mandamus, in cases warranted by the principles and usages of law, to any courts appointed or persons holding office, under the authority of the United States.' The Secretary of State, being a person holding an office under the authority of the United States, is precisely within the letter of this description; and if this court is not authorized to issue a writ of mandamus to such an officer, it must be because the law is unconstitutional, and therefore, absolutely incapable of conferring the authority, and assigning the duties which its words purport to confer and assign.\"<\/blockquote>After due consideration of the question as to the constitutionality of this Act, the court held that it was unconstitutional and that it had no original jurisdiction to issue the writ, inasmuch as this was a proceeding filed in the Supreme Court and did not come up by appeal. If the proceedings had been instituted in an inferior court and came to the Supreme Court on appeal, then the court might have had jurisdiction.<br\/><br\/>Chief Justice Marshall's same words were used in the case of Martin vs. Ingham (38 Kan., 641), as a basis for holding that the writ of mandamus would lie to the governor to compel the performance of a purely ministerial duty. The court in this case, after quoting these words of Chief Justice Marshall, said (p. 654):<br\/><blockquote>\"And such is the rule in all cases unless the courts are required to make an exception in favor of the governor.\"<\/blockquote>This statement of the Chief Justice, relied upon in the Ohio, Kansas, and other cases, deserves due consideration; but it has been held by a number of courts to be dictum, inasmuch as the only question which it was necessary to determine was one of original jurisdiction. Chief Justice Marshall, in the same opinion, made use of this language:<br\/><blockquote>\"Still, to render the mandamus a proper remedy, the officer to whom it is to be directed, must be one to whom, on legal principles, such writ may be directed.\"<\/blockquote>On the other hand, Merrill on Mandamus, p. 102 <i>et seq.<\/i>, summarizing the decisions relative to the question of mandamus against governors of States, says that:<br\/><blockquote>\"A large number of State courts hold that the writ of mandamus will never run against the governor of a State, assigning as reasons for such ruling political necessity and public policy, regardless of whether duty be imposed upon him by the State constitution or by statute.\"<\/blockquote>And under the heading \"Deductions From the Decisions,\" concludes:<br\/><blockquote>\"Fortunately such cases seldom arise, yet they show that the courts can not cope with all the difficulties, and if they can not act m some cases it can not follow that they are necessarily fhe parties to pass on other cases, where political questions of a similar nature are involved, namely, the independence of the various coordinate branches of the government. When it is remembered that the use of this writ is the outgrowth of necessity in order to meet the demands of justice, and its issuance is largely dependent upon the discretion of the court, its use to determine the legality of a body claiming to be a legislature seems questionable, while its issue to compel an action by the governor would seem to be entirely inappropriate.\"<\/blockquote>One of the leading cases which support the proposition that the courts have no jurisdiction to control the official acts of a State governor is that of Sutherland <i>vs.<\/i> Governor (29 Mich., 320). The opinion in this case was delivered by Justice Cooley, one of the leading American jurists. This is a very exhaustive opinion and one cited and followed by a number of the State courts. We think it pertinent to note the major points in this case and quote extensively from this opinion.<br\/><br\/>In 1874 an application was made to the supreme court of Michigan for an order requiring the governor to show cause why he did not issue his certificate showing that the Portage Lake and Lake Superior ship canal and harbor have been constructed in conformity with the Acts of Congress making a land grant for the same, and the acts of the legislature of this State conferring the grant upon a corporation, which the relators now claim to represent.<br\/><br\/>When this application was first presented to the court, it declined to make the usual ex parte order until the question of jurisdiction was argued. This having been done on the voluntary appearance of counsel for the relators, and of the attorney-general on behalf of the governor, the question of jurisdiction was squarely submitted to the court.<br\/><br\/>The duty which the court was asked to compel the governor to perform was one imposed upon him by statute. The relators insisted that the question involved in this case was a purely judicial one, involving nothing but a proper construction of the law.<br\/><br\/>It was not claimed on the part of the relators that that court, or any other, had jurisdiction to require and compel the performance by the governor of his political duties, or the duties devolved upon him as a component part of the legislature. It was conceded that these duties, under the constitution and laws, were to be exercised according to own judgment and on his own sense of official responsibility, and that from his decision to act or decline to act there could be no appeal to the courts.<br\/><br\/>The relators submitted the following proposition to the court which was made the basis of the decision. They claimed that, \"where the act is purely ministerial, and the right of the citizen to have it performed is absolute (vested right), the governor, no more than any other officer, is above the laws, and the obligation of the courts, on a proper application, to require him to obey the laws, is the same that exists in any other case where an official ministerial duty is disregarded.\"<br\/><br\/>It would be difficult to express the proposition in more absolute and emphatic terms. The court first considered the advisability of attempting to draw the lines between those duties of the governor which are political and those which are to be considered ministerial, and upon this point the court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"There is no very clear and palpable line of distinction between those duties of the governor which are political, and those which are to be considered ministerial merely; and if we should undertake to draw one, and to declare that in all cases falling on one side the line the governor was subject to judicial process, and in all falling on the other he was independent of it, we should open the doors to an endless train of litigation, and the cases would be numerous in which neither the governor nor the parties would be able to determine whether his conclusion was, under the law, to be final, and the courts would be appealed to by every dissatisfied party to subject a coordinate department of the government to their jurisdiction. However desirable a power in the judiciary to interfere in such cases might seem from the standpoint of interested parties, it is manifest that harmony of action between the executive and judicial departments would be directly threatened, and that the exercise of such power could only be justified on most imperative reasons. Moreover, it is not customary in our republican government to confer upon the governor duties merely ministerial, and in the performance of which he is to be left to no discretion whatever; and the presumption in all cases must be, where a duty is devolved upon the chief executive of the State rather than upon an inferior officer, that it is so because his superior judgment, discretion, and sense of responsibility were confided in for a more accurate, faithful, and discreet performance than could be relied upon if the duty were devolved upon an officer chosen for inferior duties.<br\/><center><br\/>\"* \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*<br\/><\/center> <br\/>\"We are not disposed, however, in the present case, to attempt on any grounds to distinguish it from other cases of executive duty with a view to lay down a narrow rule which, while disposing of this motion, may leave the grave question it presents to be presented again and again in other cases which the ingenuity of counsel may be able to distinguish in some minor particulars from the one before us.

On the other hand, it would be readily conceded that no court can compel the legislature to make or to refrain from making laws, or to meet or adjourn at its command, or to take any action whatsoever, though the duty to take it be made ever so clear by the constitution or the laws.\"<\/blockquote>As the legislative and judicial departments, acting within their respective spheres, are so entirely independent, the court then proceeded to determine on what ground an intervention in the case of executive duties could be justified. As the court well said in this case, such intervention could certainly not be justified on the ground that the executive is only a single person, who need await the advice or consent of no one before proceeding to the discharge of his duty, and whose default will consequently be more palpable when he acts wrongfully or refuses to act at all, than the default of any member of an aggregate body, like a legislature or a court, nor can it be because the reference of a duty or authority to an aggregate body raises an implication that it is entrusted to its judgment or discretion any more than if it were referred for performance or exercise to one person only. Then, if intervention is ever justifiable it must be upon the ground of the nature of the act to be performed. Upon this point of the case the court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"One reason very strongly pressed why the governor is subject to process in cases like the present is, that the act required is not to be done in performance of an executive duty imposed by the constitution, but is in its nature a ministerial act, provided for by statute, and which might, with equal propriety, have been required of an inferior officer, who, beyond question, could have been compelled by mandamus to take the necessary and proper action in the premises. And the question is put with some emphasis, whether, when individual interests depend upon the performance of ministerial action, to which the party is entitled of right, the question whether there shall be a remedy or not can depend upon the circumstance that in the particular case the ministerial action is required of a superior officer when there is no reason in its nature why it might not have been required of an interior.<br\/><center><br\/>*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*<br\/><\/center> <br\/>\"In many cases it is unquestionable that the head of an executive department may be required by judicial process to perform a legal duty, while in other cases, in our judgment, the courts would be entirely without jurisdiction; and, as regards such an officer, we should concede that the nature of the case and of the duty to be performed must determine the right of the court to interfere in each particular instance. When the head of a department acts as the mere assistant or agent of the executive in the performance of a political or discretionary act, he is no more subject to the control of the courts than the chief executive himself; but where a ministerial act is required to be done by him, independently of the executive, though in a certain sense he is an executive officer, it would be as idle to dispute his responsibility to legal process, as it would be to make the same claim to exemption on behalf of an officer entrusted with similar duties of a lower grade.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * <br\/><\/div><br\/>\"The apportionment of power, authority, and duty to the governor is either made by the people in the constitution, or by the legislature in making laws under it; and the courts, when the apportionment has been made, would be presumptuous if they should assume to declare that a particular duty assigned to the governor is not essentially executive.<br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><br\/>*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * <\/div><br\/>\"Were the courts to go so far, they would break away from those checks and balances of government which were meant to be checks of cooperation and not of antagonism or mastery, and would concentrate in their own hands something at least of the power which the people, either directly or by the action of their representatives, decided to entrust to the other departments of the government.\"<\/blockquote>It was urged that should it be held that the governor could not be compelled to perform purely ministerial duties, that such a conclusion would leave parties, who have rights in many cases, without a remedy. In disposing of this question the court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"Practically there are a great many such cases, but theoretically there are none at all. All wrongs, certainly, are not redressed by the judicial department. A party may be deprived of a right by a wrong verdict, or an erroneous ruling of a judge, and though the error may be manifest to all others than those who are to decide upon his rights, he will be without redress. A person lawfully chosen to the legislature may have his seat given by the house to another, and be thus wronged without remedy. A just claim against the State may be rejected by the board of auditors, and neither the governor nor the courts can give relief. A convicted person may conclusively demonstrate his innocence to the governor, and still be denied a pardon. In which one of these cases could the denial of redress by the proper tribunal constitute any ground for interference by any other authority? The law must leave the final decision upon every claim and every controversy somewhere, and when that decision has been made, it must be accepted as correct. The presumption is just as conclusive in favor of executive action as in favor of judicial.\"<\/blockquote>The court then declined to make any order to show cause.<br\/><br\/>Another leading case which supports the same proposition, that the courts have no jurisdiction to control the official acts of a State governor, is that of Hawkins <i>vs.<\/i> Governor (1 Ark., 570, 33 Am. Dec, 346), decided in 1839. In this case an act of the legislature declared \"that there shall be elected by the general assembly a commissioner of public buildings,\" and that this official shall be commissioned by the governor.\u00a0 The applicant was duly elected, but the governor withheld the commission. In passing upon the question involved, the court, speaking through Justice Lacy, said (p. 347):<br\/><blockquote>\"The first question, then, submitted for our consideration and decision is, has the supreme court jurisdiction of the case? or is the governor of the State such an officer to whom the writ may be properly directed upon legal or constitutional principles?<br\/><blockquote><div style=\"text-align: center;\">*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * <br\/><\/div><\/blockquote>\"So far as this case (Marbury vs. Madison) can be considered as authority at all, it goes to disprove the position that the writ can legally be directed to the executive of the State (p. 349).<br\/><center><br\/>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * <\/div><br\/><\/center> \"All the officers of the government, except the President of the United States, and the executives (governors) of the States, are liable to have their acts examined in a court of justice.

In this case the court said (p. 232):<br\/><blockquote>\"It is urged upon us, that in a government of laws there must be an adequate remedy for every wrong, and that where a clear right exists, there must be some mode of enforcing that right. While human society is governed by so imperfect a being as man, this can be true only in theory. If we are to compel the governor or the legislature to right every wrong which may arise from their omissions of duty, then surely they must, in order to make this Utopian system perfect, have the power to compel us to do right in every case. May it not be as well supposed that we will act perversely, and refuse to perform a duty imposed upon us, to the injury of the citizen, as that the governor will do so? In the formation of the government, equal confidence was rightfully reposed in each department, to which appropriate and independent duties were assigned.\"<\/blockquote>A case showing the difficulties which would arise if the courts were to attempt to differentiate between ministerial and discretionary acts of the governor comes from the civil law, State of Louisiana. (State <i>vs.<\/i> Warmoth, 22 La. Ann., 1.)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this case the court said\u00a0\u00a0 (p. 4):<br\/><blockquote>\"Circumstances may arise and conditions may exist which would require the governor of a State, in the proper exercise of his duty, and with regard to the interests of the State, not to perform a ministerial act. Is the judge to determine his duty in such a case and compel him to perform it? The reasons of the executive for the nonperformance of an act the judge may never know, or if brought to his knowledge, he may review and overrule them, and, in so doing, assume political functions.\"<\/blockquote>In the case of People <i>vs.<\/i> Cullom (100 111., 472), the substantial facts were as follows: The county judge of Ogle County resigned his office. The governor was notified of the resignation and appointed a judge to fill the vacancy. A petition was presented to the governor asking him to call a special election on the ground that under the constitution he had no power to appoint. The governor refused to call an election and mandamus was asked to compel him to do so. The court, without discussion, based its opinion upon the case of People <i>vs<\/i>. Bissell (<i>supra<\/i>), and denied the petition.<br\/><br\/>We think that the weight of authority, based upon legal principles and sound reasoning, supports the proposition that in the United States the supreme courts of the States do not have jurisdiction to control the official acts of the governor. For better reasons we conclude that this court has no jurisdiction, either by mandamus or injunction, to control the official acts of the Governor-General, inasmuch as we have seen that his duties, powers, and responsibilities are more comprehensive than those conferred upon any State Governor. When the Philippine legislative body confers upon the Governor-General powers and duties, it does so for the reason that he is in a better position to know the needs of the country than any other member of the executive department, and with the full confidence that he will perform such duties, under his official oath, as his best judgment dictates. If this had not been the intention of the Legislature, they could have placed the duty upon some other official of the executive department. It no doubt is sometimes very necessary for the Governor-General to perform certain important executive duties without delay, and should this court attempt to distinguish between purely ministerial and discretionary duties, conferred upon him by law, and attempt to determine in each case which are purely ministerial, which are political, or which are discretionary, the Governor-General, to that extent, would become subservient to the judiciary. To avoid this is why the three great coordinate departments of the Government were created and made independent of each other. President McKinley in creating civil government in this country took into consideration these fundamental principles of separate and independent departments, which have been demonstrated to be essential to a republican form of government, and conferred upon the Governor-General, as the Executive of the Philippine Islands, the power to execute the laws according to his best judgment, holding him responsible to the President of the United States, without interference on the part of the judiciary. In so doing he reposed in the Executive of this country great confidence, realizing that he, the Executive, acting independently of the judiciary, would be in a better position to carry out the great underlying principles of American institutions for the peace and happiness of the inhabitants of this country. The President realized that the final decision of every question in controversy must be left somewhere, and when such decision has been made it must be accepted as correct. The presumption is just as conclusive in favor of executive action, as to its correctness and justness, as it is in favor of judicial action.<br\/><br\/>It is argued that if the courts have no control over the official acts of the Governor-General, the Government would become one of men and not of laws. If this is true, why is it not also true that if the judiciary, which is composed of men, can enter the field assigned to the Chief Executive and determine what are his political, ministerial, and discretionary duties, the Government, to that extent, would become one of men and not of laws?<br\/><br\/>In the case at bar we are called upon to compel the Governor-General to call a special election in the town of Silay for the purpose of electing a municipal president. We are not disposed, neither will we attempt on any grounds, to distinguish this case from any other case of executive duty, with a view, as was said in the case of Sutherland<i> vs.<\/i> Governor (<i>supra<\/i>), \"to lay down a narrow rule which, while disposing of this case, may leave the grave question it presents to be presented again and again in other cases.\" But after due consideration, and being fully aware of the seriousness of the question, we have reached the conclusion that we have no jurisdiction to interfere with the Governor-General of these Islands, as the head of the executive department, in the performance of any of his official acts.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons we conclude:<br\/><ol><li>That the preliminary injunction prayed for in this case should not be issued;<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>\u00a0That the facts alleged in the complaint do not constitute a cause of action; and,<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>That we can not and should not entertain a complaint which seeks to control or interfere with the official duties of the Governor-General<\/li><\/ol>The demurrer is, therefore, sustained, and the complaint dismissed, without special ruling as to costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

JACINTO LIMJAP, OPPONENT AND APPELLANT.<br\/>\n<br\/>\nD E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">By a writing presented on the 3d of January, 1906, the representative of Irineo Felix\u00a0 requested the\u00a0 registration of a parcel of land belonging to the latter,\u00a0 situated in the town of Antipolo, Rizal Province, bounded on the north by Calle Real; on the east by lots owned by Braulia Cuepangco and Engracia Loalhati; on the south by Calle Martinez; and on the west by lots belonging to Gregorio Lim and Braulia Cuepangco;\u00a0 it has an area of 815.98\u00a0 square meters and its description and boundaries are stated in the plan attached to the petition; the said property, as alleged, was acquired by purchase from the owner of the same, Vicente Francisco Ayco, was assessed at the last assessment at $110 United States currency, and is free from all incumbrances, no one having any right or interest therein; it is now occupied by the applicant who, after the\u00a0 hearing of this case and before judgment was rendered in the\u00a0 premises, conveyed the\u00a0 said land by means of an absolute sale to Canuto Reyes for the sum of P600, according to the\u00a0 notarial instrument appearing at folio 78.<br\/><br\/>On the 4th of April, 1907, the\u00a0 representative of Jacinto Limjap made\u00a0 written opposition\u00a0 to the foregoing application,\u00a0 requesting that the same be dismissed and\u00a0 that the registration of the said\u00a0 property in favor of Irineo Felix with costs be\u00a0 denied; he alleged\u00a0 that\u00a0 the opponent is the owner and present possessor of\u00a0 the land and denied\u00a0 that the applicant\u00a0 or his predecessors or\u00a0 principals\u00a0 had ever been in legal or material possession\u00a0 of the same,\u00a0 and\u00a0 also denied all the other allegations not expressly or implicitly denied in the previous paragraphs.<br\/><br\/>The case\u00a0 came\u00a0 up for trial and evidence was adduced by both parties to the suit, the documents exhibited by them being made\u00a0 of record. On the 3d of March, 1909, the trial court overruled the opposition of Limjap and decreed the adjudication and registration of\u00a0 the aforesaid property in favor of Canuto Reyes,\u00a0 after declaring a general default. The opponent excepted to the foregoing decision and moved for a new trial, on the ground\u00a0 that the judgment\u00a0 was\u00a0 contrary to law and not sustained\u00a0 by the evidence; the motion was overruled; the petitioner excepted and gave notice of his intention to appeal by the\u00a0 corresponding bill of exceptions which was duly presented, approved, and submitted to this court.<br\/><br\/>From the record of the case forwarded by the Court of Land Registration upon this appeal, it is fully\u00a0 proven by means of documents and by\u00a0 the testimony of\u00a0 competent witnesses:\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 That Crisostomo Marero possessed the land in question under title of ownership and sold it under pacto de retro to Vicente Francisco Ayco on the 25th of May, 1874, for the sum of 60 pesos, on condition that the vendor and the purchaser would both receive as partners the rent that the house erected on said land should produce, according to document marked with the letter \"B\"; (2) that\u00a0 in view of the fact that the vendor did not redeem the property within the period fixed by article 1508 of the Civil Code, as no term whatever was stipulated in the contract sale with the right of repurchase, Vicente Francisco sold it on the 17th of December, 1906, to Irineo Felix under public instrument, folio 7, and the latter,\u00a0 after having applied for the registration of his title in the registry of property, also sold the said lot to Canuto Reyes, in whose favor the\u00a0 registration was decreed.<br\/><br\/>It appears to have been admitted by the opponent, who did not impugn in due course the document marked as Exhibit B of the applicant, that Crisostomo Marero was the original owner\u00a0 and possessor of said land, and,\u00a0 as it does not appear that Marero had transferred his control over the property to Braulia Cuepangco, no possible reason exists under the law for considering the latter\u00a0 to be the lawful owner of the land; therefore, she could\u00a0 neither\u00a0 have\u00a0 disposed of it nor sold it to the\u00a0 opponent Limjap.<br\/><br\/>As\u00a0 a matter of fact Cuepangco, as stated by her son-in-law and attorney-in-fact or representative, Dalmacio Gui- dote, in his affidavit, folio 99 of the record, never possessed nor pretended to\u00a0 own the said parcel\u00a0 of land situated between two lots belonging to\u00a0 his mother-in-law,\u00a0 and when he sold them in her behalf he\u00a0 did not include\u00a0 the intermediate lot, which was the property of\u00a0 one Marero, who subsequently sold\u00a0 it to the\u00a0 Chinaman Vicente\u00a0 Francisco, and the latter to\u00a0 Irineo Felix, and this fact was stated to the notary Manikis; and even though at first he refused to subscribe the instrument\u00a0 of sale\u00a0 drawn\u00a0 up by\u00a0 the said notary, because it referred to lands of larger\u00a0 area, he afterwards did so because after consulting with Attorney Sotelo, the notary assured\u00a0 him that as the\u00a0 writing contained no clause providing for the protection of purchaser from interference, nothing serious could happen.<br\/><br\/>Article 430 of the Civil Code provides that \"Natural possession is the holding of\u00a0 a\u00a0 thing\u00a0 or the\u00a0 enjoyment of a right by a person.\u00a0\u00a0 Civil possession is the\u00a0 same holding or enjoyment, together with the intention of acquiring ownership of the thing or right.\"<br\/><br\/>If Braulia\u00a0 Cuepangco was never in\u00a0 material nor civil possession of the land in\u00a0 question, and did not\u00a0 even\u00a0 have the intention to possess it,\u00a0 and if her representative and son-in-law, Dalmacio Guidote, being well aware that the said land situated between the two parcels owned by\u00a0 his mother-in-law belonged to a third person, Ireneo Felix, the\u00a0 last purchaser, and for this reason he did not include the same in the sale of the two parcels to Limjap, the latter could never have acquired any right to the land of the applicant, because none was ever transferred to him by the vendor Cuepangco, under the instrument\u00a0 marked\u00a0 wi$h the letter A,\u00a0 folio 66, who was not the owner\u00a0 of\u00a0 the intermediate\u00a0 land\u00a0 or lot owned by\u00a0 Vicente\u00a0 Francisco,\u00a0 and finally sold\u00a0 to Canuto Reyes.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the rights in the said land acquired by Vicente Francisco by virtue of the contract of sale contained in document marked \"B,\" executed in his favor by the owner Crisostomo Marero, more than thirty years ago, in the presence of the <i>gobernadorcillo accidental<\/i> of Antipolo,\u00a0 notwithstanding the\u00a0 fact that it is not a transfer by a public instrument recorded in the registry of property, the\u00a0 transfer arose from a valid\u00a0 contract,\u00a0 and is legal and efficient; for this reason Vicente Francisco was the owner and possessor with just title and in good faith, and the right that he transmitted to the applicant must\u00a0 be sustained and protected by the courts while no better title under the law has been presented; nor has\u00a0 it been shown that the property was redeemed\u00a0 in due course.\u00a0 Therefore,\u00a0 the applicant has an unquestionable right to have his title recorded in the registry of property.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the identity of the land, it has been sufficiently shown by the documents offered in evidence, among which is the plan that was presented and which the witness Guidote\u00a0 had before him when\u00a0 testifying in the presence of the opponent,\u00a0 and\u00a0 also by the testimony of the\u00a0 witnesses examined at the trial.\u00a0 The opponent has not proven that the land,\u00a0 the registration of which has been applied for, is not the land described\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 application, in the public instrument, and by the plan above\u00a0 referred\u00a0 to, or that it was larger than it should really\u00a0 be; for\u00a0 which reason, in\u00a0 the absence\u00a0 of proof to the contrary, it must be acknowledged and admitted that said facts so proven are true.<br\/><br\/>The mere fact that in the instrument of sale of the lands of Cuepangco\u00a0 to Limjap a greater extension\u00a0 was stated than the actual area, including a parcel which belonged to another and not the property of the vendor, can not have conferred\u00a0 any\u00a0 right whatever to the purchaser\u00a0 over the land improperly included, even though he consented to have the clause of eviction and warranty suppressed in\u00a0 the document, because the inclusion was\u00a0 made without the knowledge or consent of the real owner of the land, and Cuepangco, who did not own the property, could not dispose of it or sell it; and the pretension\u00a0 of the opponent is all\u00a0 the more unsustainable inasmuch as the representative of the vendor, who acted in her behalf in negotiating and closing the sale, frankly and spontaneously acknowledged that an error had been committed by including in the document the land of the applicant which has not been, and could not be included in said sale, that he had endeavored\u00a0 to correct the error, and that, if he subsequently subscribed the instrument it was through the advice of the lawyer,, who assured him that nothing could happen if said clause of eviction and warranty were suppressed.<br\/><br\/>Article 1281, paragraph 2, of the Civil Code provides that<br\/><blockquote>\"If the words should appear contrary to the evident intention of the contracting parties, the intention shall prevail.\"<br\/><br\/>Article 1283 of said code prescribes that \"However general the terms of a contract may be, there should not be understood\u00a0 as included therein\u00a0 things and cases different from those with regard to which the persons interested intended to contract.\"<\/blockquote>Hence, considering that the land of the applicant was not the subject\u00a0 of the contract, and that it could not so be for the reason that it did not belong to the vendor, it can in nowise\u00a0 be understood as included in the instrument of sale which appears at folio 66, no matter\u00a0 what may be the terms of the document.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons,\u00a0 by which are\u00a0 refuted the errors assigned to\u00a0 the judgment appealed from, wherein the deposition of witness Vicente Francisco is entirely disregarded, it\u00a0 is our\u00a0 opinion\u00a0 that the said judgment should be and is hereby affirmed, with the costs against the appellant.\u00a0\u00a0 So\u00a0 ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano,\u00a0 C.

The precise question submitted to this court for decision is whether\u00a0 the vacating order thus entered was a final order subject to appeal, or\u00a0 whether it was a mere\u00a0 interlocutory order, and as\u00a0 such not subject to appeal.\u00a0 We are\u00a0 not called upon, at this time, to consider the legality or validity of that order, or to determine whether it was or was\u00a0 not properly\u00a0 entered under all the circumstances of the case.<br\/><br\/>In the\u00a0 case of Go-Quico <i>vs.<\/i> The Municipal Board of Manila (1 Phil. Rep.,\u00a0 502), one of the\u00a0 early cases decided by this court,\u00a0 we sustained a motion to dismiss the appeal on the ground that\u00a0 the order from which the appeal had been taken\u00a0 was not a final one,\u00a0 and after discussing the\u00a0 not altogether uniform rulings of the American cases, we said (p. 508):<br\/><blockquote>\"In considering the American authorities it must be borne in mind\u00a0 that probably no one of the statutes therein construed contained such strong provisions against appeals from interlocutory resolutions as are found in our article 123. The evils resulting from such appeals under the <i>Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil <\/i> were\u00a0 well\u00a0 known.\u00a0 It was to cure such evils that this article was adopted.\u00a0 It expressly prohibits appeals not\u00a0 only from interlocutory orders, but also from interlocutory judgments.\u00a0 This\u00a0 prohibition is reiterated in article 143, which says: 'Upon the rendition of final judgment <i>disposing of the action<\/i> either party shall have the right to perfect a bill of\u00a0 exceptions.'\"<\/blockquote>Since that time\u00a0 this court has strictly and\u00a0 uniformly adhered to the doctrine enunciated in the case\u00a0 just cited, and indeed an examination of the decisions will disclose that we have steadfastly denied the right of appeal from rulings, orders, and judgments of the lower court until final judgment has been rendered\u00a0 for one\u00a0 party or the other, and have construed the term\u00a0 final judgment in this connection in its strictest sense, as a\u00a0 j udgment completely disposing of, and finally determining the action or proceeding\u00a0 wherein it was entered.<br\/><br\/>It seems\u00a0 quite clear that the vacating\u00a0 order in the case at bar did not make a final\u00a0 disposition of the proceedings wherein it was entered.\u00a0\u00a0 Those proceedings were originally had in accordance with the provisions of Act No. 627 and its\u00a0 amendments,\u00a0 for the purpose of securing\u00a0 a judicial declaration\u00a0 that certain lands\u00a0 are public lands,\u00a0 and\u00a0 when the original order, which\u00a0 if not appealed\u00a0 or vacated would have\u00a0 finally disposed\u00a0 of\u00a0 those proceedings,\u00a0 was in part vacated in a motion made in those very\u00a0 proceedings, they were left, pro tanto, in\u00a0 precisely the\u00a0 condition in which they were before that part of the vacated order was entered. There was thereafter no final judgment, order, or decree of the court in existence which disposed of or terminated that part of the original proceedings affected by\u00a0 the vacated order, and accordingly it was the duty of the court, upon motion or otherwise,\u00a0 to go forward with the proceedings until it had entered a \"proper judgment, order, or decree, making a final disposition thereof.\u00a0\u00a0 It is\u00a0 not\u00a0 necessary\u00a0 for us to consider whether, under the circumstances, further proceedings in\u00a0 the nature of a new trial\u00a0 were necessary before a final judgment, order, or decree could or should have been entered; it is sufficient for our purposes to say that until the court\u00a0 below\u00a0 had\u00a0 made some final disposition of the matters\u00a0 left undecided as a result\u00a0 of the\u00a0 entry of the vacating order, the action\u00a0 of the court below could not be brought here for review upon appeal.<br\/><br\/>Black in his work on Judgments, volume 1, paragraph 34, points out that a distinction\u00a0 is to be\u00a0 made between an independent action brought (under particular statutes authorizing such actions) for the purpose of vacating a former judgment between the same\u00a0 parties and procuring a\u00a0 new trial of the action and a case wherein\u00a0 the application comes in the form of a motion made in the\u00a0 same cause.\u00a0 In the former class of cases it has\u00a0 frequently been held that a judgment granting the relief asked for is final and appealable, because \"the issues in\u00a0 the independent suit having been determined and the relief accorded, the decision puts an end to that controversy.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (McCall <i>vs<\/i>. Hitchcock, 7 Bush, 615; Belt <i>vs<\/i>. Davis, 1 Cal., 134; State <i>vs<\/i>. Allen, 92 Mo., 20,\u00a0 4 S. W. Rep., 414) ;\u00a0 and similar reasoning seems to have led to a like conclusion where the method of seeking relief was by the ancient writ of audita querela, which was a regular suit with\u00a0 its usual incidents, pleadings, issues of law and fact, trial,\u00a0 judgment, and error.\u00a0\u00a0 (Fitch <i>vs<\/i>. Scovel, 1 Root, 56; White <i>vs.<\/i> Clapp,\u00a0 8 Allen, 283; Gordonier <i>vs<\/i>. Billings, 77 Pa. St.,\u00a0 498.)<br\/><br\/>But in\u00a0 those cases\u00a0 where\u00a0 the application\u00a0 comes in the form of a motion made in the same cause, an order vacating the judgment is not a final appealable judgment, since, as we have seen, the effect is to leave the cause open for further proceedings before the final judgment or decree can be entered.\u00a0\u00a0 (McCulloch <i>vs<\/i>. Dodge, 8\u00a0 Kan., 476; Higgins <i>vs.<\/i> Brown, 5 Colo., 345; Brown <i>vs<\/i>. Edgerton, 14 Neb., 453, 16 N. W. Rep., 474.)<br\/><br\/>Counsel\u00a0 for appellant cites in support of his contention the cases cited in Freeman on Judgments, volume 1, paragraph 18;\u00a0 but these cases as well as the text\u00a0 in support of which they are cited will be found to deal with vacating judgments rendered\u00a0 in separate\u00a0 actions brought to\u00a0 vacate a judgment in a former action or proceeding; and Freeman in paragraph 32 (c)\u00a0 of the same work cites many cases in support of his text which there sustain the general doctrine as laid down herein.<br\/><br\/>After\u00a0 ten days let judgment be entered dismissing this appeal with costs\u00a0 against the appellant, and\u00a0 twenty days thereafter let the record be returned to the court below.\u00a0\u00a0 It is so ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

S.\u00a0 Crossfield, judge of the Court\u00a0 of First Instance, directing Him to execute and carry out the judgment of this court, rendered on appeal on the 17th day of August, 1910, in the case of De la Pena <i>vs.<\/i> Hidalgo.<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup><br\/><br\/>Petitioner alleges that on the 11th day of October he appeared by\u00a0 his attorney in the Court of\u00a0 First Instance of the city of Manila, and orally prayed the judge thereof, the\u00a0 Hon. A. S. Crossfield, to issue a writ\u00a0 of execution\u00a0 on the above-mentioned judgment, and at the same time to\u00a0 issue an order directing the clerk to turn over to him a certain cash deposit,. which petitioner alleges he placed in the hands of the clerk in lieu of an appeal bond in the course of the proceedings had in the court below, and to the release of which as he alleges, he was entitled as a necessary and immediate consequence of the judgment of this court rendered on the appeal of the case above-mentioned.\u00a0 Petitioner further\u00a0 alleges that respondent refused to issue execution on the judgment in question, and declined to order the clerk to\u00a0 turn over the cash deposit as requested.<br\/><br\/>Respondent denies that\u00a0 petitioner or his attorney did in fact ask for the issuance of execution, and disclaiming all intent or desire to fail or neglect to comply with the terms of the judgment in question, so far as it imposed any duty upon him, alleges that in response to the request for an order directing the turning over of the cash deposit in the hands of the clerk to the petitioner, he, the respondent, informed counsel for the petitioner that he\u00a0 would take the proper action in that regard as soon as the parties in interest had been duly notified, and he had time to examine the judgment by virtue of which petitioner claimed the right to the deposit. The record discloses that on the day the application for the release of the\u00a0 deposit was made, an order was issued by respondent to the various parties in interest to appear within four days from the date thereof and show cause if any they had, why the deposit should not be released.<br\/><br\/>There is considerable conflict in the testimony as to precisely what occurred on the occasion when counsel for petitioner appeared in open court, and as he alleges, orally moved the court to issue execution on the judgment of this court, and to order the release of the cash deposit; but it\u00a0 is not necessary for us to make any findings on the disputed facts, because we are of opinion that, granting the truth of the petitioner's allegations and of the\u00a0 evidence\u00a0 he submitted in support thereof,\u00a0 and taking into\u00a0 consideration only those allegations of respondent which are supported by\u00a0 the testimony offered by him and\u00a0 uncontroverted by the evidence offered by the petitioner,\u00a0 the writ of mandamus\u00a0 prayed for should not issue.<br\/><br\/>The issuing of an execution is a ministerial act, and must be carefully distinguished from the awarding of an execution, which is a judicial act.\u00a0 \"To award is to adjudge, to give\u00a0 anything\u00a0 by judicial sentence\/' and when\u00a0 it is said that\u00a0 a party is awarded an execution upon a judgment it should be understood thereby that it is judicially declared that\u00a0 the party\u00a0 has a right to have the judgment executed. It need not, therefore, be expressly granted nor even mentioned in the judgment.\u00a0\u00a0 The prevailing party\u00a0 is always entitled\u00a0 as\u00a0 of right to the execution of\u00a0 the\u00a0 judgment\u00a0 in the manner and form prescribed by\u00a0 law,\u00a0 so that the very act of granting judgment is of itself an award of execution thereon.\u00a0\u00a0 (Freeman on Executions, 3d edition, Vol. I, par. 9a, and cases there cited.)\u00a0 The right of a party to have an execution having been duly adjudged, the mere issuing\u00a0 of the writ when\u00a0 the time for\u00a0 its issuance\u00a0 as prescribed by law has arrived; that is to say, the preparation and delivery of the formal writ or order to the sheriff, or other officer charged with the execution of judgments, directing him\u00a0 to proceed with the execution is a mere compliance with the provisions\u00a0 of the award of judgment, and essentially a purely ministerial act.<br\/><br\/>In\u00a0 the absence of\u00a0 statutory provisions\u00a0 to the\u00a0 contrary, and speaking generally,\u00a0 all courts\u00a0 which\u00a0 have power and jurisdiction\u00a0 to render judgments have inherent powers to enforce such judgments, for \"If a court is competent to pronounce judgment, it\u00a0 must be equally competent to\u00a0 issue execution to\u00a0 obtain its\u00a0 satisfaction.\u00a0 A court without the means of executing its judgment and decrees would be an anomaly\u00a0 in\u00a0 jurisprudence, not\u00a0 deserving the name\u00a0 of\u00a0 a judicial tribunal.\u00a0 It would be idle to adjudicate what could not be executed,\u00a0 and the power to pronounce necessarily implies\u00a0 the\u00a0 power\u00a0 of execution.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (U.\u00a0 S.\u00a0 <i>vs.<\/i> Drennan, Hemp., 325.)\u00a0 Hence where the\u00a0 statute does not otherwise provide,\u00a0 and when\u00a0 a party has a right\u00a0 to\u00a0 execution,\u00a0 it becomes the\u00a0 imperative duty of the court to issue the proper writ;\u00a0 and this duty\u00a0 will necessarily be\u00a0 performed\u00a0 by the judge or\u00a0 justice himself when the court has no clerk; but when\u00a0 the court has a clerk, in whose hands is intrusted the court seal,\u00a0 and who is charged with\u00a0 the\u00a0 keeping of the court records and the issuance of process under the seal of the court, the imperative duty of issuing the writ of execution, which in such cases as we have seen is purely a ministerial function of the court, manifestly devolves upon him, unless in a particular case\u00a0 the judge elects to perform the duty\u00a0 himself instead\u00a0 of intrusting it to\u00a0 his ministerial officer.<br\/><br\/>It is\u00a0 evident, therefore, that in the absence of statutory designation of the officer or person whose duty it is to issue execution,\u00a0 mandamus\u00a0 will\u00a0 lie to the judge\u00a0 or justice of an inferior court who has no cleric; but that\u00a0 under similar circumstances mandamus will not lie to the judge if the court has\u00a0 a clerk who could issue the writ, because in such cases the duty of issuing the\u00a0 writ is not obligatory on the judge, who may, and in general does leave the performance of this\u00a0 purely ministerial function of the court to the clerk.\u00a0 And on the other hand, the\u00a0 duty being imperative and\u00a0 obligatory upon the clerk, the\u00a0 writ in\u00a0 such cases properly lies to\u00a0 him\u00a0 in the event of his refusal or neglect to perform it.<br\/><br\/>Our statute, section 444 of Act No. 190, expressly provides that writs of execution must be \"sealed with the\u00a0 seal of the court,\u00a0 and subscribed by the judge, or clerk thereof,\" and it has been suggested that the effect of this provision is to impose the duty on each of these officers, so\u00a0 that in the event of the failure of either of them to perform it when called upon\u00a0 to do so by a party entitled to the writ, mandamus should issue to compel him to perform the duty thus imposed\u00a0 upon him.\u00a0 We do not think so.\u00a0 This proision in so far as a grant of authority to the judge and clerk to issue writs is to be inferred therefrom, is merely declarative of the authority, which, as we have seen, might be exercised by those officers of the court in the absence of express statutory provisions.\u00a0 It does not, in\u00a0 itself, impose the imperative duty of issuing these writs on either the judge or clerk.\u00a0 It merely declares that either of\u00a0 these\u00a0 officers may, and that one of them must subscribe the writ, and we must look elsewhere in seeking to determine whether the imperative duty is imposed by statute upon either of them.<br\/><br\/>Section 384 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which treats of the general duties of clerks of Courts of First Instance provides that:<br\/><blockquote>\"The clerk shall be the recording officer of all the proceedings of the court.\u00a0 He or his deputy may, at any time, receive and\u00a0 file all complaints, answers, motions, reports, injunctions,\u00a0 orders, judgments, decrees,\u00a0 or\u00a0 other\u00a0 papers affecting\u00a0 an action\u00a0 or special proceeding offered for the purpose;\u00a0 and shall indorse upon all such papers the time when and the party by whom they were respectively filed, and may\u00a0 issue, under the seal\u00a0 of the court,\u00a0 all process authorized by law to be issued by him and\u00a0 proper in any action or\u00a0 proceeding\u00a0 pending in\u00a0 the\u00a0 court\u00a0 of which\u00a0 he is clerk.\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.\"<\/blockquote>This provision of the code,\u00a0 read together with the\u00a0 provision which requires the name of the judge or clerk to be subscribed to\u00a0 the writ expressly confers authority and imposes the duty upon\u00a0 the clerks\u00a0 of\u00a0 the Courts of First Instance to issue writs of execution; and since, as we\u00a0 have seen, the issuance of the writ in a proper case is\u00a0 a purely ministerial function of the court, the duty thus imposed on the clerk becomes an\u00a0 imperative one when he is requested to issue the writ by a judgment creditor who is entitled to execution on his judgment.\u00a0\u00a0 But there is no provision of\u00a0 law which expressly\u00a0 or by implication\u00a0 imposes the\u00a0 imperative duty of performing this ministerial function of the court upon the judge when the court is provided with a clerk.\u00a0 On the contrary, the code clearly recognizes the right of the\u00a0 judge to leave the issuance\u00a0 of executions to the proper ministerial officer, in the various sections\u00a0 which provide that by special order the judge may \"direct\" that execution issue in certain cases.\u00a0 In no case\u00a0 does it provide that a judge himself shall issue\u00a0 the\u00a0 execution\u00a0 when the court is provided with a clerk.\u00a0 And the various provisions of\u00a0 the code\u00a0 touching the functions of the\u00a0 various officers of\u00a0 the Court of\u00a0 First Instance clearly indicate that such\u00a0 courts being\u00a0 provided with a clerk, the judge may, and in the orderly conduct of the business of his\u00a0 court, he usually\u00a0 should leave\u00a0 to\u00a0 the proper ministerial officers of the\u00a0 court\u00a0 the performance of this, as\u00a0 well as\u00a0 all\u00a0 other ministerial functions\u00a0 which these officers are authorized to perform.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 imperative\u00a0 duty of issuing\u00a0 writs\u00a0 of\u00a0 execution\u00a0 not being imposed by statute upon the judges of Courts of First Instance, a judge of one of these courts is strictly within his\u00a0 rights when he leaves the performance of this purely ministerial duty to the clerk, and it is manifest that mandamus will not lie to compel him to issue the writ.<br\/><br\/>The prayer of the\u00a0 petitioner for mandamus to the judge of the court below, in so\u00a0 far as it\u00a0 is based on his failure to direct the release of the fund on deposit\u00a0 in the\u00a0 hands of the clerk of the court may be disposed of without much discussion.\u00a0 The record\u00a0 clearly discloses, and petitioner substantially admits\u00a0 that respondent\u00a0 did not absolutely refuse to\u00a0 issue the order; and that,\u00a0 on the contrary,\u00a0 he informed counsel for petitioner that he would do what was proper in that regard, but that first it would be necessary for him to carefully\u00a0 acquaint himself with the\u00a0 contents of the judgment of this court, for the purpose of ascertaining its true meaning and effect; and further, that before issuing the order the various parties in interest should be notified and given an opportunity\u00a0 to\u00a0 show cause, if any they had, why the order should not issue, intimating as one of the reasons for giving all\u00a0 the parties an opportunity to be heard, that in the event that any of the parties were\u00a0 to perfect\u00a0 an appeal from the judgment of this\u00a0 court\u00a0 to\u00a0 the Supreme Court of the United States, the release of the deposit might not be justified.<br\/><br\/>Without deciding whether, in any event,\u00a0 an appeal\u00a0 of the judgment of this court to the Supreme\u00a0 Court of the United States would or would not have furnished a sufficient reason for denying the motion to release the deposit in the event that this question had been raised, we are of opinion that the prayer for mandamus based as it is on respondent's refusal to\u00a0 issue the order\u00a0 without first giving the parties in\u00a0 interest an opportunity to be heard should be\u00a0 denied. The release of the\u00a0 deposit was not expressly\u00a0 directed in the judgment of this court which was certified to the court below, and the right of petitioner thereto\u00a0 is at most\u00a0 an inference to be drawn\u00a0 from the terms of\u00a0 the judgment. While we can conceive of instances wherein an inference of this nature might be so clear, definite, and free from doubt as\u00a0 to justify a court in\u00a0 acting .thereon without having\u00a0 all the 'parties to the action before it; nevertheless, we think that in any case wherein there\u00a0 is no final\u00a0 judgment, order or\u00a0 decree expressly directing the release of such a deposit, the better practice would be te decline to issue an order for its\u00a0 release unless it appears that all the parties in\u00a0 interest have had notice of motion therefor, and an\u00a0 opportunity to be heard to show cause, if any they have, why it should not issue.\u00a0\u00a0 The very fact that money is deposited with the court implies, as a rule, that there\u00a0 are in the proceedings different parties claiming an interest therein, and\u00a0 in\u00a0 the absence of\u00a0 a final and\u00a0 unappealable judgment,\u00a0 order,\u00a0 or decree expressly\u00a0 adjudicating the\u00a0 rights\u00a0 of the\u00a0 various claimants thereto, the turning\u00a0 over of\u00a0 such funds on an <i>ex parte<\/i> motion would be an extremely dangerous practice which might lead to great abuse.<br\/><br\/>The petition for a writ of mandamus should be dismissed with the costs against the petitioner.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

The form\u00a0 of the writ\u00a0 is\u00a0 immaterial\u00a0 and\u00a0 it matters not whether it be\u00a0 issued under the signature of\u00a0 the judge and of\u00a0 the clerk or the\u00a0 latter's alone,\u00a0 but it would be the most\u00a0 expedient,\u00a0 in\u00a0 my opinion,\u00a0 inasmuch as\u00a0 its\u00a0 issuance has already previously been ordered by the judge, for the writ to issue by order of the judge with the signature only of the clerk of the court and the\u00a0 proper seal.<br\/><br\/>For the\u00a0 foregoing reasons, and in view of\u00a0 the fact that the petition of the plaintiff Hidalgo as well as the ruling of the judge thereon, were\u00a0 both merely verbal, it is proper, in my opinion, to deny the application for a writ\u00a0 of mandamus.<br\/><\/div>",

Reyes,\u00a0 the municipal treasurer, and examining the accounts of\u00a0 the said treasury.\u00a0 Reyes was\u00a0 at\u00a0 his office,\u00a0 but alleging that he had forgotten his keys he asked for\u00a0 a few minutes in order to get them; his absence, however,\u00a0 lasted about forty minutes and\u00a0 as soon as he returned the inspector ordered him to open the safe and place\u00a0 all the money\u00a0 contained in it on the table.\u00a0 The inspector noticed that Reyes was worried and nervous, and that his\u00a0 pockets were bulging out;\u00a0 that he went to another apartment of the building\u00a0 and brought back an old cigar box without a lid, which contained, when counted, the sum\u00a0 of P1,520; this sum, according to Reyes, was\u00a0 a portion of the municipal funds.\u00a0\u00a0 Deputy Espinosa observed that Reyes' trousers pockets no longer bulged out, for which reason he refused to receive the aforesaid amount as being part of the municipal funds, and because the money was\u00a0 not\u00a0 in\u00a0 the safe; but as Reyes insisted that\u00a0 the\u00a0 said sum was\u00a0 the amount of certain checks that\u00a0 he\u00a0 had had cashed,\u00a0 it\u00a0 was agreed between\u00a0 them to lay the matter before W. W. Barclay, the provincial\u00a0 treasurer, and\u00a0 to this\u00a0 end\u00a0 Espinosa and Reyes went to San\u00a0 Fernando, the capital of the province, to\u00a0 see the provincial treasurer.<br\/><br\/>In the presence of\u00a0 the latter, Pedro\u00a0 A. Reyes\u00a0 repeated his statement that\u00a0 the said sum of P1,520\u00a0 was the value of certain checks, although he was unable to say by whom they were drawn, or\u00a0 where and by whom the same were cashed; he only indicated two persons for P500\u00a0 each, and the balance he said was cashed at his own house; but the Chinese named Suana and Reyes' own wife denied having cashed\u00a0 any\u00a0 check.\u00a0 Later on\u00a0 Reyes\u00a0 told Treasurer Barclay that the checks were\u00a0 cashed at the bank in Manila, but that he had\u00a0 forgotten\u00a0 the name of the bank, as well as the name of the person who at his request\u00a0 had gone to Manila\u00a0 to\u00a0 cash them;\u00a0 however, as the\u00a0 investigation proceeded Reyes\u00a0 finally confessed\u00a0 that\u00a0 he had taken the money from the municipal\u00a0 safe and had loaned it to some of his friends residing in the\u00a0 said town, although he could not give their names, but\u00a0 he assumed the responsibility therefor.<br\/><br\/>During the counting of the\u00a0 cash found in the safe,\u00a0 Treasurer Reyes, between\u00a0 2\u00a0 and\u00a0 3 o'clock\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 afternoon, presented the sum of P155.86 which\u00a0 he\u00a0 took\u00a0 from the drawer of the desk of his clerk, Carlos Dyjanco,\u00a0 saying that this amount\u00a0 was a portion of or proceeded from the market collections,\u00a0 and had\u00a0 been\u00a0 in the\u00a0 custody of said clerk from Saturday until Monday,\u00a0 the 27th of said month. This witness, notwithstanding the fact\u00a0 that he was\u00a0 in the office since that morning, and that he witnessed the\u00a0 counting of the money, made\u00a0 no mention of\u00a0 said amount until the afternoon of\u00a0 that\u00a0 day.<br\/><br\/>Before the counting of the money was finished,\u00a0 Reyes asked if there was still any\u00a0 deficit for him to make up, and in effect, between 3 and 4 p. m., he was told that there was\u00a0 still a shortage of P193.79; which sum, as soon\u00a0 as he was informed, he\u00a0 took\u00a0 out of his pocket\u00a0 and gave to the said clerk,\u00a0 Dyjanco,\u00a0 directing him\u00a0 to\u00a0 hand over the amount to Espinosa.<br\/><br\/>At\u00a0 about\u00a0 9\u00a0 p.\u00a0 m. on\u00a0 the\u00a0 same\u00a0 day\u00a0 Reyes signed the document offered\u00a0 in evidence as\u00a0 Exhibit\u00a0 A, wherein\u00a0 he himself admitted that he was short in the sum of Pl,869.65. He told C. F. Richmond,\u00a0 the\u00a0 district auditor, that he was responsible for the shortage and that he assumed the\u00a0 whole responsibility, but he said he could not be prosecuted other than for estafa because he had refunded the money,\u00a0 and prayed\u00a0 that\u00a0 he be not\u00a0 prosecuted before the courts because it would\u00a0 be unpleasant for him as he was a married man.<br\/><br\/>A complaint\u00a0 was filed by the provincial fiscal on the 2d of June, 1908,\u00a0 with the Court of First Instance of Pampanga, charging Pedro A. Reyes with the crime of misappropriation of public funds\u00a0 under Act No. 1740, and these proceedings were instituted.\u00a0 The trial judge entered judgment on the 13th of October of the same year,\u00a0 and sentenced the accused to\u00a0 the penalty\u00a0 of three years'\u00a0 imprisonment, to pay a fine of ?l,500, and in case of insolvency to suffer subsidiary imprisonment at the rate of one day for every P2.50 that he\u00a0 failed to pay, which\u00a0 subsidiary imprisonment, however, should not exceed one third of the principal penalty,\u00a0 he further sentenced him to be perpetually\u00a0 disqualified for public office and to pay the costs.\u00a0 From said judgment the accused has appealed.<br\/><br\/>The facts related in the complaint bear the character of the crime of misappropriation of public funds, under section 1 of Act No.\u00a0 1740, enacted October 3,\u00a0 1907, which reads as follows:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"Any bonded officer or employee of the Insular Government, or of\u00a0 any provincial or\u00a0 municipal government, or of the city of Manila, and any other person who, having charge, by reason of his office or employment, of Insular, provincial,\u00a0 or municipal funds or\u00a0 property, or\u00a0 of funds or property of the city of Manila, or of trust or other funds by\u00a0 law required to be kept or deposited by or with such officer, employee,\u00a0 or other person, or by or with any public office, treasury, or other depositary, fails\u00a0 or refuses to account for the same, or makes personal use\u00a0 of such funds or property, or of any part thereof, or abstracts or misappropriates\u00a0 the\u00a0 same, or any part thereof, or is guilty of any malversation with reference to such funds or property, or through his abandonment, fault, or\u00a0 negligence permits any other person to abstract, misappropriate, or make personal use of the same, shall, upon conviction, be punished by imprisonment for not less than two months nor more than ten years and, in the discretion\u00a0 of the court, by a fine of not more than the amount of such funds and the value of such\u00a0 property.\"<\/blockquote><br\/><br\/>It appears fully proven in the case that Deputy Inspector Panfilo Espinosa went to the office of the municipal treasurer of Guagua after 9 o'clock on the morning of the 27th of April, 1908; that when the\u00a0 accused\u00a0 Pedro A. Reyes, opened his safe by order of said\u00a0 inspector and\u00a0 counted\u00a0 the money therein, there appeared a shortage of Pl,869.65.\u00a0 As this\u00a0 amount\u00a0 was not in the municipal safe the\u00a0 treasurer in charge of\u00a0 its care and custody must\u00a0 be considered as being discovered in default; this he acknowledged himself to be in the\u00a0 document marked \"Exhibit A,\" drawn up at the time as a result of the inspection, and which was subscribed by the accused.\u00a0 It is undeniable that as a result of the counting of the money, which, by the books of the municipal treasurer of Guagua\u00a0 ought\u00a0 to be in\u00a0 the\u00a0 safe, there appeared a\u00a0 shortage of P1,869.65 which, according to the provisions of section 21\u00a0 (e)\u00a0 of Act\u00a0 No. 82, should have been kept in the municipal safe, apart from the private funds of the treasurer; the latter\u00a0 was not empowered to dispose of, loan, or use it, except in the manner authorized by law.<br\/><br\/>The accused pleaded not guilty, and denied the charge imputed to\u00a0 him.\u00a0 His allegations\u00a0 in\u00a0 exculpation were\u00a0 not proven, and\u00a0 indeed he himself contradicted them in\u00a0 his statements to the inspector, the provincial treasurer, W.\u00a0 W. Barclay, to the district auditor,\u00a0 C.\u00a0 F.\u00a0 Richmond, and\u00a0 by the contents\u00a0 of the said\u00a0 document\u00a0 Exhibit\u00a0 A authorized by the accused himself.<br\/><br\/>By the terms of the said Act,\u00a0 the regulations published by the Insular Auditor, and the circular instructions issued to all treasurers, it was the unavoidable duty of\u00a0 the accused as a treasurer, to deposit all moneys belonging to the municipality,\u00a0 or other Government funds,\u00a0 in the safe\u00a0 kept for that purpose, and which is in charge of the officer charged with the custody of the same.<br\/><br\/>When the accused\u00a0 Reyes was ordered by\u00a0 the\u00a0 inspector Espinosa\u00a0 to produce all\u00a0 the\u00a0 money\u00a0 which,\u00a0 according\u00a0 to the books of the municipal treasury\u00a0 of Guagua,\u00a0 ought\u00a0 to have been in the safe under his charge, he was unable to comply with the order, which was a perfectly legal one; the\u00a0 result\u00a0 showed\u00a0 that the said\u00a0 sum\u00a0 of\u00a0 Pl ,869.65 was missing from the safe, and when asked to explain how and\u00a0 why such part of the funds,\u00a0 which according to the books\u00a0 ought to\u00a0 be found\u00a0 therein,\u00a0 was so missing, after making various vague\u00a0 explanations,\u00a0 he finally stated\u00a0 at the expiration of some hours that\u00a0 he\u00a0 had disposed of part of the money belonging to the safe and had loaned it\u00a0 to certain of his friends in\u00a0 the\u00a0 town, and that although\u00a0 he could not give their names he assumed all the\u00a0 responsibility in the\u00a0 premises; on making this confession he alleged that as he had refunded the money taken from the municipal funds\u00a0 he\u00a0 believed that he could\u00a0 only\u00a0 be\u00a0 prosecuted for <i>estafa.<\/i><br\/><br\/>In spite of this, the defense alleged that the money with which\u00a0 the accused Reyes had replaced the amount missing from the municipal safe was in the precincts of the treasury,\u00a0 and should therefore be\u00a0 admitted\u00a0 and considered\u00a0 as forming a part of the funds in said safe.<br\/><br\/>Act\u00a0 No. 82 and the regulations on the subject prescribe that\u00a0 funds belonging\u00a0 to the treasury must be kept in the safe, with the exception of certain amounts\u00a0 required for the purpose of\u00a0 making change during\u00a0 office hours, and it appears by the confession of the accused\u00a0 himself that he disposed\u00a0 of the missing money for the purpose of loaning it\u00a0 to\u00a0 some of his friends;\u00a0 thus, when\u00a0 the inspector presented himself at his office and ordered\u00a0 him to produce the money,\u00a0 he went back\u00a0 to his house on the pretext\u00a0 of getting the keys,\u00a0 and\u00a0 when he returned more than half\u00a0 an hour later, he brought with him a little less than the amount that\u00a0 was lacking; this he produced in a manner and under conditions that leads to the well-founded presumption that the said sum of Pl,520 was not in the office, and that he had been obliged to recover it from the friends to whom he said he\u00a0 had loaned it.\u00a0 From all of the above it is undeniable that said amount did\u00a0 not form part of the municipal funds,\u00a0 nor was it in the office of the municipal treasurer as belonging to such\u00a0 funds at the time when the demand was made,\u00a0 and it must further\u00a0 be taken into account that\u00a0 the sums of P155.86 and P193.79 were still short and were paid some hours later.<br\/><br\/>Section 2 of Act No. 1740, cited above, provides:<br\/><br\/><blockquote><br\/>\"In all prosecutions for violations\u00a0 of the preceding section, the absence of any of the public funds or property of which\u00a0 any\u00a0 person described in said section\u00a0 has\u00a0 charge, and any\u00a0 failure or\u00a0 inability\u00a0 of\u00a0 such person to produce all the funds and property properly\u00a0 in his charge on the demand of\u00a0 any\u00a0 officer authorized\u00a0 to examine or\u00a0 inspect such person, office, treasury,\u00a0 or depositary shall be deemed to\u00a0 be prima\u00a0 facie evidence\u00a0 that such missing funds or property have been\u00a0 put to personal uses or used\u00a0 for\u00a0 personal ends by such person within the meaning of the preceding section.\"<\/blockquote><br\/><br\/>The accused performed the duties of said office for more than\u00a0 three\u00a0 years; therefore\u00a0 he knew perfectly well that it was strictly his duty to keep and maintain in the municipal safe all of such amounts\u00a0 as constituted the funds of the municipality; but having been surprised on that morning by the\u00a0 sudden\u00a0 appearance of the inspector, and by the latter's peremptory demand to open the safe and produce\u00a0 for the\u00a0 purpose of counting all the money in his charge, he at once understood that he had\u00a0 incurred liability on account of the absence of part of the funds that should have been found therein; even before the money was counted he appeared to be worried and nervous, passing from\u00a0 one side of the house to the other, sweating copiously, and showing by\u00a0 his demeanor that he was\u00a0 not an innocent man; thereafter, in view of the result of the count he subscribed the document marked as \"Exhibit A,\" admitting that the amount misappropriated was\u00a0 in effect missing from\u00a0 the safe,\u00a0 and confessing at the same time that he had loaned the money of the municipality to some of his friends although he assumed all\u00a0 the responsibility therefor.<br\/><br\/>So\u00a0 that, the case not only offers prima facie and unimpeached evidence of\u00a0 the crime,\u00a0 under\u00a0 the provisions of the foregoing section\u00a0 2 of Act No. 1740, but other conclusive proof that the accused disposed of a certain portion of the municipal funds and employed the same for personal and outside\u00a0 uses, other than such\u00a0 as are authorized by law, since it is so testified by Treasurer Barclay, Auditor Richmond, and Inspector Espinosa,\u00a0 competent\u00a0 witnesses who saw the money counted and\u00a0 heard the confession and other\u00a0 statements of the\u00a0 accused\u00a0 at\u00a0 the\u00a0 time when they were exercising their functions.<br\/><br\/>Even though the confession which the accused made in the presence of the above-named\u00a0 officers only constitutes circumstantial\u00a0 evidence,\u00a0 or raises\u00a0 a grave suspicion as to him, according to law 7, title 13, partida 3, yet, it\u00a0 is corroborated however by other circumstantial data showing that the three amounts with which the shortage was covered came\u00a0 from\u00a0 other persons, or from places\u00a0 outside of the treasury building, and it is a fully \"proven fact,\u00a0 admitted by said accused, that on counting the\u00a0 money which according to the books, ought to have been in the treasury, the amount stated\u00a0 in the\u00a0 said document Exhibit A was missing; thus it was that the accused, being convinced of the truth\u00a0 and reality of the fact, made no objection to signing said document, and for this\u00a0 reason\u00a0 his culpability as the only principal, convicted beyond\u00a0 all doubt of the\u00a0 crime prosecuted herein, can\u00a0 not be denied.\u00a0 The fact that on the same date that the\u00a0 money was counted he\u00a0 refunded the amount that\u00a0 he had misappropriated\u00a0 does not exempt him from responsibility, it having been proven that he had withdrawn the same from the safe and used it for personal or for outside purposes, without warrant, and in\u00a0 manifest violation of the law requiring that all public funds, including municipal funds, shall be kept only in the safe.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons the several unfounded errors assigned to the judgment appealed from have been fully refuted, since in conclusion\u00a0 it is fully shown\u00a0 that\u00a0 the\u00a0 accused unlawfully\u00a0 disposed of a portion\u00a0 of\u00a0 the municipal funds, putting the same to his own use and to that of other persons in violation of Act No.\u00a0 1740,\u00a0 and consequently he has incurred the\u00a0 penalty therein\u00a0 established\u00a0 as\u00a0 principal of the crime of misappropriation;\u00a0 and even though when imposing it, it is not necessary to adhere to the rules of the Penal Code, the court\u00a0 in using\u00a0 its discretional powers as authorized by law, believes that the circumstances present in the commission\u00a0 of crimes should be taken into consideration,\u00a0 and in the present case the amount misappropriated was refunded at the time the funds were counted.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, in\u00a0 view of what has\u00a0 been set forth, it\u00a0 is our opinion that the judgment appealed from should be affirmed, provided, however, that the\u00a0 principal\u00a0 penalty\u00a0 shall be six months' imprisonment with the costs of this instance against the accused.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

This latter parcel of land the lower court held belonged to the estate of Vito Tiongco.<br\/><br\/>In\u00a0 discussing the\u00a0 evidence\u00a0 adduced during the trial relating to\u00a0 the\u00a0 question of ownership\u00a0 of said house and parcel of land, the lower court\u00a0 said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The preponderance of evidence\u00a0 in this case establishes the fact that the house in question, with the tile roof, was originally the property of Catalina Tiongco, sister of Anselma, which was afterwards left to Anselma by virtue of the will made by Catalina before her death,\u00a0 and that after that time,\u00a0 probably\u00a0 in 1887, her\u00a0 nephew,\u00a0 Vito Tiongco, was appointed <i>gobernadorcillo<\/i> of Molo,\u00a0 whose appointment was contested with much animosity, among other objections adduced against him being the allegation that he\u00a0 was not the owner of any realty.\u00a0 In order to\u00a0 counteract his opposition and avoid his\u00a0 being\u00a0 defeated for that\u00a0 reason, Anselma,\u00a0 who\u00a0 then\u00a0 possessed\u00a0 many properties, put him into possession of the\u00a0 said tile-roofed house\u00a0 as apparently his own property.\u00a0 He lived in the house from that date up to\u00a0 the time of his death in 1904, and, as\u00a0 it appeared to everybody, he considered it as if he was the real\u00a0 owner thereof.\u00a0\u00a0 He made many repairs as well as alterations in the house on his account and to suit his own wishes.\u00a0 From the weight of the evidence I find that, after being put\u00a0 into possession of the\u00a0 house in the manner above mentioned, Anselma agreed that he could have the house as his\u00a0 own if he would pay to her P3,OO0, which sum is alleged to be the amount paid by her sister Catalina\u00a0 for the erection of said house; and that\u00a0 afterwards, and before the death of Anselma,\u00a0 he had paid this sum to the satisfaction of\u00a0 Anselma, and, while I can not find any formal conveyance of the property on the part of Anselma, I do find that some time subsequent to that date he claimed it as his property and it was recognized as his\u00a0 own, therefore, I am inclined to find that the house with tile roof was, at the time of the death of Anselma, really\u00a0 <i>the property of Vito Tiongco<\/i>, her nephew.\"<\/blockquote>From this decision of the lower court the plaintiffs appealed and made the following assignments of error in\u00a0 this court:<br\/><blockquote>\"First.\u00a0 In allowing the defendants to\u00a0 prove, by means of oral evidence, the ownership of the said realty.<br\/><br\/>\"Second. In\u00a0 declaring that Anselma\u00a0 Tiongco sold\u00a0 the realty in question to Vito Tiongco.\"<\/blockquote>The appellant in his brief said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The question now at issue in\u00a0 this court is limited to <i>the said house.<\/i>\"<\/blockquote>The appellant contends, in\u00a0 his first assignment of error, that the lower court\u00a0 committed an\u00a0 error by allowing the defendants\u00a0 to\u00a0 prove\u00a0 the sale\u00a0 of\u00a0 said\u00a0 parcel\u00a0 of\u00a0 land by Anselma Tiongco\u00a0 to\u00a0 Vito\u00a0 Tiongco,\u00a0 in\u00a0 or about the year 1887,\u00a0 by\u00a0 oral\u00a0 proof.\u00a0 The simple\u00a0 question\u00a0 presented is, May the sale of real\u00a0 property made in\u00a0 1887 be proven by oral testimony? In support of his contention the appellant cites articles 1278,\u00a0 1279, and 1280 of the Civil Code.\u00a0 These articles of the\u00a0 Civil Code have already been construed by this court\u00a0 in the cause\u00a0 of\u00a0 Couto <i>vs.<\/i> Cortes\u00a0 (8 Phil. Rep., 459) as well as in the cause of Thunga Chui<i> vs<\/i>. Que Bentec (2 Phil. Rep.,\u00a0 561),\u00a0 where the court held that\u00a0 \"An\u00a0 oral contract for the sale of real estate, made prior to the enactment of the Code of Civil Procedure, is binding between the parties thereto, although it may still be necessary for the parties, seeking to enforce\u00a0 such contract to take some action to secure the execution of proper documents, but this requirement will not render the agreement invalid.\"<br\/><br\/>Section 335 of the\u00a0 Code of Procedure\u00a0 in Civil Actions, now in force, has established a rule relating to the method of proving contracts of sale of real property, and an oral contract for the sale of real property can not now be proven under said section 335 except \"some note or memorandum thereof\u00a0 be in writing\u00a0 and subscribed by the party charged or by his agent.\"\u00a0 However, said\u00a0 section (335) makes no attempt to render such contracts\u00a0 [oral contracts] invalid. It simply provides that the contract shall not be enforced by an action, unless the same is evidenced by some note or memorandum.\u00a0 This provision (sec. 335) of the code simply provides how contracts\u00a0 for the sale of real property shall be proved.\u00a0\u00a0 It does not attempt to make contracts invalid which have not been executed in writing.\u00a0 This provision does not go to the existence of the contract, except when made by an agent (par. 5 of sec. 335).\u00a0 It simply requires a\u00a0 form\u00a0 of contract.\u00a0\u00a0 The contract exists\u00a0 and\u00a0 is\u00a0 valid, though it may not be clothed\u00a0 with\u00a0 the necessary form and the\u00a0 effect of a\u00a0 noncompliance with the provisions\u00a0 of the statute is simply that no action can be proved unless the requirement\u00a0 is complied\u00a0 with;\u00a0 but a\u00a0 failure to except\u00a0 to the evidence because it does not conform with the statute is a\u00a0 waiver of\u00a0 the provisions of the law.\u00a0\u00a0 (Anson on\u00a0 Contracts, p. 75.)\u00a0 If the parties to the action, during the trial make no objection to the admissibility of\u00a0 oral evidence to support a contract of sale of real property, and thus permit the contract to be proved, it will be just as binding upon the parties as if it had been\u00a0 reduced to\u00a0 writing.\u00a0 In the present case\u00a0 the defendants called thirteen witnesses, who each testified concerning the sale of the parcel of land and the house in question by Anselma Tiongco to Vito Tiongco, in\u00a0 or about the year 1887, and no\u00a0 objection was made by the plaintiffs to the admissibility of this testimony.\u00a0\u00a0 The plaintiffs did\u00a0 not invoke\u00a0 the provisions of\u00a0 section\u00a0 335. <i>They permitted\u00a0 the defendants to prove the oral contract of sale.<\/i>\u00a0 The contract of sale, therefore, being fully proven, and under the provisions of the law an oral contract for the sale of real property being binding and valid between the parties,\u00a0 we see no escape from the conclusion that if the evidence\u00a0 was sufficient to show the sale, that the contract was binding, even though it had not been reduced to writing.<br\/><br\/>The second question is, then, Was the evidence adduced during the trial sufficient\u00a0 to\u00a0 show\u00a0 that Anselma Tiongco sold the parcel of land in\u00a0 question to\u00a0 Vito Tiongco in or about\u00a0 the year 1887?\u00a0 The lower court found\u00a0 that a\u00a0 preponderance of the evidence showed that the sale had actually been\u00a0 made.\u00a0 Upon a\u00a0 full consideration\u00a0 of the evidence adduced during the trial upon this question, we are satisfied and so hold\u00a0 that\u00a0 a large\u00a0 preponderance of the evidence shows, beyond question, that said sale took place and\u00a0 that Vito Tiongco, at the time\u00a0 of his\u00a0 death was the\u00a0 owner of the said parcel of land.<br\/><br\/>For the reasons heretofore stated, the judgment of the lower court is hereby\u00a0 affirmed, with costs.\u00a0 So\u00a0 ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Dorotea Diaz opposed\u00a0 the registration of the petitioner's title to the land in\u00a0 question upon the ground that the land sought to be registered by the petitioner contained within its limits 16\u00a0 hectares of land in the possession of\u00a0 said oppositor.\u00a0 Rosario\u00a0 Diaz\u00a0 also\u00a0 opposed\u00a0 the registration\u00a0 of petitioner's\u00a0 title to\u00a0 said land upon the ground that\u00a0 said land described\u00a0 in the petition included within its limits\u00a0 12 hectares of land in the possession\u00a0 of said Rosario\u00a0 Diaz. These two seem to found their opposition upon a possession of their respective parcels of land, although there is no real proof in the case of such possession, and also upon certain papers issued to them by the Insular Government, giving them authority to take possession of the lands mentioned as homesteads.\u00a0\u00a0 Such permission from the Insular Government in favor of Rosario Diaz was\u00a0 obtained the 28th of December, 1907; that in favor of Doroteo Diaz bears date the 8th day of February, 1908.\u00a0\u00a0 Neither of those instruments contains a description of the land referred to therein and we have no means\u00a0 of knowing from\u00a0 the record where said lands are located or what their limits or\u00a0 boundaries may\u00a0 be.\u00a0 The right of the\u00a0 said\u00a0 oppositors in the lands claimed in their\u00a0 opposition rests\u00a0 solely\u00a0 upon the permits issued to them respectively\u00a0 by the\u00a0 Insular Government. There is no proof in the case of their possession of the lands and no\u00a0 evidence as to their location, situation,\u00a0 boundaries, or limits. There is no proof whatever upon which we may sustain the opposition.<br\/><br\/>The attorney for the oppositors makes some\u00a0 claim that the right to the possession of the\u00a0 land in question has been once\u00a0 adjudicated by the Court of First Instance of the Province of Nueva Ecija in an action brought\u00a0 to test the right\u00a0 to such possession, entitled \"Bernardo Ferrer <i>vs.<\/i> Venancio Diaz and others,\" in which the complaint of Ferrer was dismissed by the judge.\u00a0 An examination of the order made by the court in that action\u00a0 discloses that said action was dismissed without a trial\u00a0 upon the merits and expressly without prejudice to the bringing of another action for the determination of the rights of the parties to the land in question.<br\/><br\/>After a careful examination of the record and the proofs we are unable to see any reason why the judgment of the court\u00a0 below,\u00a0 ordering the registration of the\u00a0 petitioner's title to the land described in the\u00a0 petition, namely, 14 hectares 62 ares and 32 centares, should not be sustained.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below is hereby affirmed, with costs against the appellants.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano,\u00a0 C.

The four petitioners, as co-owners, sought to have registered\u00a0 the following-described property:<br\/><blockquote>\"A parcel\u00a0 of land situated in the barrio\u00a0 of Talampas, municipality\u00a0 of Baliuag, Province of\u00a0 Bulacan, upon which are situated three houses and one camarin of light material, having a superficial area of 52 hectares, 51\u00a0 ares, and 22 centares; bounded on the north by the highway (<i>calzada<\/i>) of Talampas\u00a0 and the lands of Rita Ruiz Mateo; on the east by the lands of the said Rita Ruiz Mateo,\u00a0 Hermenegildo Prado, Policarpo de Jesus,\u00a0 and a stream called\u00a0 Sapang Buslut; on the south by the same stream and the\u00a0 lands of the <i>capellania<\/i>; and on the west by the stream called Sapang Buslut, and the lands of Vicente de la Cruz, Jose Camacho and Domingo Ruiz Mateo.\"<\/blockquote>This parcel of agricultural land is used for the raising of rice and\u00a0 sugar cane and is assessed at $1,000 United States currency.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 petition, which was\u00a0 filed\u00a0 on the 18th of December,\u00a0 1906, was accompanied by a plan and technical description of the above-described parcel of land.<br\/><br\/>After hearing the\u00a0 proofs presented, the court entered, on the 12th of February,\u00a0 1908, a decree in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 6 of section 54 of Act\u00a0 No. 926, directing that the land described in the petition be registered in the names of the four petitioners,\u00a0 as coowners, subject to the usufructuary right of Vicente Reyes, widower of Remedios Grey.<br\/><br\/>On the 16th of June, 1908, Anacleto Ratilla de la Cruz filed a motion\u00a0 in the\u00a0 Court of Land Registration asking for a revision of the case, including the decision, upon the ground that he is the absolute owner\u00a0 of the two parcels of land which are described in said motion, and which, according to his\u00a0 allegations', are included in the lands decreed to the petitioners.\u00a0 He alleged that the decree\u00a0 of February 12, 1908, was obtained maliciously and fraudulently by the petitioners, thereby\u00a0 depriving him of said two parcels of land.\u00a0 He further alleged that he was the absolute owner of the two parcels of land, having inherited them from his father, Baldomero R.\u00a0 de la\u00a0 Cruz, who had\u00a0 a state grant for the same.\u00a0\u00a0 He therefore asked, under the provisions of section 38 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 Land Registration Act\u00a0 (No.\u00a0 496), a revision of the case, and that the said decree be modified so as to exclude the two parcels of land\u00a0 described in\u00a0 said motion.\u00a0 The\u00a0 Land Court upon this\u00a0 motion reopened\u00a0 the case, and\u00a0 after hearing the\u00a0 additional evidence presented by both,parties, rendered, on the 23d of November, 1908, its decision modifying the former decree by excluding from the\u00a0 same the\u00a0 two parcels of land claimed\u00a0 by Anacleto Ratilla de la Cruz.\u00a0\u00a0 From this decision and\u00a0 judgment\u00a0 the petitioners appealed and now insist, first, that the trial court erred in reopening the\u00a0 case and modifying its decree. dated the\u00a0 12th of February, 1908, for the reason that\u00a0 said decree was not obtained by means of fraud; and, second,\u00a0 that the\u00a0 court erred in holding that the two parcels of land described in the appellee's motion are not\u00a0 their property.<br\/><br\/>It was agreed by counsel that the two small parcels\u00a0 now in dispute form a part of the land described in the petition and\u00a0 were included in the decree of February 12, 1908,\u00a0 and that the petitioners\u00a0 are the\u00a0 owners of\u00a0 the\u00a0 remainder of the land described in the said decree.<br\/><br\/>The petitioners\u00a0 inherited this land from their\u00a0 parents, who acquired the same, including the two small parcels in question, by purchase, as is evidenced by a public document dated\u00a0 the 26th of November,\u00a0 1864, duly executed\u00a0 before Francisco Iriarte, <i>alcalde mayor<\/i> and judge of the Court of First Instance of the Province of Bulacan.<br\/><br\/>Baldomero R. de la Cruz, father of the appellee, obtained in March, 1895, a state\u00a0 grant for several parcels of land, including the two parcels in question.\u00a0 This grant was duly inscribed in the old register of property in Bulacan on the 6th of April of the same year.<br\/><br\/>It is admitted that at the time the appellants presented their petition\u00a0 in this case\u00a0 the\u00a0 appellee was occupying the two parcels\u00a0 of land now in question.\u00a0 It is\u00a0 also admitted that the name of the\u00a0 appellee does not appear in the said petition as\u00a0 an\u00a0 occupant\u00a0 of the\u00a0 said\u00a0 two\u00a0 parcels.\u00a0 The petitioners\u00a0 insist that the\u00a0 appellee was occupying these parcels as their tenant and\u00a0 for\u00a0 this reason they did not include his name in their petition, as an occupant, while the appellee contends that he was occupying the said parcels as the absolute owner under the state grant by inheritance.<br\/><br\/>The court below held that the failure on the part of the petitioners\u00a0 to\u00a0 include\u00a0 the\u00a0 name\u00a0 of the appellee\u00a0 in their petition, as\u00a0 an occupant of these two parcels of land, was a violation of section 21 of Act No. 496, and that this constituted fraud within\u00a0 the\u00a0 meaning of\u00a0 section 38 of said Land Registration Act.\u00a0 The trial court further held that the grant\u00a0 from\u00a0 the state\u00a0 should prevail over\u00a0 the\u00a0 public document of purchase of 1864.<br\/><br\/>The mother of the petitioners died on November 15, 1881; their father died prior to that time.\u00a0\u00a0 Manuela, the\u00a0 oldest of the petitioners, was about six\u00a0 years of age when their mother died.\u00a0 So these\u00a0 children\u00a0 were minors when\u00a0 the father of the appellee obtained\u00a0 the state\u00a0 grant.<br\/><br\/>On the 13th of June, 1882, Jose Grey, uncle and representative of the. petitioners, who were then minors, rented the land owned by the petitioners' deceased parents to one Irineo Jose\u00a0 for a period of\u00a0 three years.\u00a0 On\u00a0 the 23d\u00a0 of March, 1895, the said\u00a0 Jose Grey, as the representative of the petitioners, rented the\u00a0 same\u00a0 land for a\u00a0 period of six years to Baldomero R. de la Cruz, father of the appellee. This\u00a0 rental\u00a0 contract was duly\u00a0 executed\u00a0 in writing.\u00a0\u00a0 This land was cultivated during these six years by Baldomero R. de la Cruz and his children, one of whom is the appellee. On the 14th\u00a0 of December, 1905, Jose Grey, for himself and the other petitioners,\u00a0 rented the\u00a0 same land\u00a0 to\u00a0 Estanislao R. de la Cruz for a period of two years.\u00a0 Estanislao de la Cruz\u00a0 on entering into this\u00a0 rental contract with Jose Grey did so for himself and his brothers, one of whom is the appellee.\u00a0 While the appellee\u00a0 admits\u00a0 that his\u00a0 father and brother entered into these rental contracts and did, in fact, cultivate\u00a0 the petitioners' land, nevertheless\u00a0 he insists that the two\u00a0 small\u00a0 parcels\u00a0 in\u00a0 question\u00a0 were.not\u00a0 included\u00a0 in these contracts.\u00a0 In the rental contract between the uncle of\u00a0 the\u00a0 petitioners and\u00a0 the\u00a0 father of the appellee the land is not described.\u00a0 In the rental contract between Jose Grey, one of the petitioners, and Estanislao R. de la Cruz, brother of\u00a0 the\u00a0 appellee, the two small parcels of land in question are included, according to the description\u00a0 given therein. This was found, to be true by the court below, but the said court held that as this contract was made by Estanislao R. de\u00a0 la Cruz it was not binding upon Anacleto R. de la Cruz, the appellee.<br\/><br\/>The two small parcels of land in question were purchased by\u00a0 the\u00a0 parents of the petitioners in 1864, as is\u00a0 evidenced by\u00a0 the\u00a0 public document of purchase\u00a0 and\u00a0 sale of that year. The same two parcels of land are included in\u00a0 the state grant issued in favor of\u00a0 Baldomero Ratilla de la\u00a0 Cruz in 1895. This grant was obtained after the death of the petitioners' parents and while\u00a0 they were minors.\u00a0 So it is clear that the petitioners honestly believed that the appellee was occupying the said parcels as their lessee\u00a0 at\u00a0 the thne they presented their application\u00a0 for registration.\u00a0\u00a0 They did not act in\u00a0 bad\u00a0 faith, nor\u00a0 with any\u00a0 fraudulent intent, when they omitted to include\u00a0 in their application the name of the appellee as one of the occupants of the land.\u00a0 They believed that it was not necessary nor required that they include in their application the names of their tenants.\u00a0\u00a0 Under these circumstances, did the court below commit an error in reopening this case in June, 1908, after its decree\u00a0 had been entered in February of the same year?<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 application\u00a0 for\u00a0 registration\u00a0 is to be in\u00a0 writing, signed and sworn to\u00a0 by the applicant, or by some person duly authorized in his behalf.\u00a0\u00a0 It is to contain an\u00a0 accurate description of the land.\u00a0 It shall contain the name in full and the address of the\u00a0 applicant, and also the names and addresses of all occupants of land\u00a0 and\u00a0 of all adjoining owners, if known; and, if not known,\u00a0 it shall state what search has been made to find them.\u00a0 In the form of notice given by statute,, which shall be sworn to, the\u00a0 applicant is required to state and set forth clearly all mortgages or encumbrances affecting said land, if any, the rights and interests, legal or equitable, in the possession, remainder, reversion, or expectancy of air persons, with their names in full,\u00a0 together with their place of residence and post-office addresses.\u00a0 Upon receipt of the application the clerk shall cause notice of the filing to be published twice in the Official\u00a0 Gazette.\u00a0\u00a0 This published notice shall be\u00a0 directed to all persons appearing to have an interest in the\u00a0 land sought\u00a0 to be registered and to the adjoining owners, and also <i>\"to\u00a0 all\u00a0 whom it may concern.\" <\/i> In\u00a0 addition to the notice in the Official Gazette the Land Court shall, within seven days after said publication, cause a copy of the notice, in Spanish, to be mailed by the clerk to every person named in the application whose address is known; to cause a duly attested copy of the notice, in Spanish, to be posted in a conspicuous place on every parcel of land included in the application, and\u00a0 in\u00a0 a conspicuous place on the\u00a0 chief\u00a0 municipal building of the town in which the land is situated. The court may\u00a0 also\u00a0 cause\u00a0 other or further notice of the application to be given in such manner and to such persons as it may deem proper.\u00a0 The\u00a0 certificate of the clerk that he has served the notice as\u00a0 directed by the court by publication or\u00a0 mailing shall\u00a0 be conclusive\u00a0 proof of such service. Within the time allowed in the\u00a0 notices, if no person appears and answers, the court may at\u00a0 once, upon motion of the applicant,\u00a0 no reason to the contrary appearing, order a general\u00a0 default.\u00a0 By the description in the\u00a0 published notice \"to all whom it may concern,''\u00a0 and by express provision of law\u00a0 \"all the world are made parties defendant and shall be concluded\u00a0 by the default and order.\"\u00a0\u00a0 If the court, after hearing, finds that the applicant has title, as stated in his application, a decree\u00a0 of registration shall be\u00a0 entered.<br\/><blockquote>\"Every decree of registration\u00a0 shall\u00a0 bind\u00a0 the land\u00a0 and quiet title thereto, subject only to the exceptions stated in the\u00a0 following\u00a0 section.\u00a0\u00a0 It\u00a0 shall be\u00a0 conclusive\u00a0 upon and against <i>all persons<\/i>, including the Insular Government, and all the branches thereof, whether mentioned by name in the application, notice, or citation,\u00a0 or included in the general description '<i>to all whom it may concern.<\/i>'\u00a0 Such decree shall not be opened\u00a0 by reason of the absence, infancy, or other disability of any person affected thereby, nor by any proceedings\u00a0 in\u00a0 any court for\u00a0 reversing judgments or decrees; subject,\u00a0 however,\u00a0 to\u00a0 the right\u00a0 of any\u00a0 person deprived of land or of any\u00a0 estate or\u00a0 interest therein by decree of registration <i>obtained by\u00a0 fraud<\/i> to file in the Court of Land Registration a petition for review within one year\u00a0 *\u00a0 * *.\" (Sec. 38\u00a0 of Act No.\u00a0 496.)<\/blockquote>The appellee is not included in any of the exceptions named in section 38 referred to above.<br\/><br\/>It will\u00a0 be seen that the applicant is required to mention not only the outstanding interest which he admits but also all claims of interest, though denied by him.\u00a0 By express provision of law all the\u00a0 world are made parties defendant by the description in the notice \"to all whom it may concern.\"<br\/><br\/>Although the appellee, occupying the two\u00a0 small parcels of land in question under the circumstances as we have set forth, was not served with notice, he\u00a0 was\u00a0 made a\u00a0 party defendant by publication; and the entering of a decree on the 12th of February, 1908, must be held to\u00a0 be\u00a0 conclusive against all\u00a0 persons,\u00a0 including\u00a0 the appellee, whether his (appellee's) name is\u00a0 mentioned in the application,\u00a0 notice, or citation.<br\/><br\/>The said\u00a0 decree of February 12, 1908,\u00a0 should not have been\u00a0 opened on account of the absence, infancy, or other disability of any person affected thereby, and\u00a0 could have been\u00a0 opened only on\u00a0 the ground that the said\u00a0 decree had been obtained by fraud.\u00a0 That decree was not obtained by fraud on the\u00a0 part of\u00a0 the applicants,\u00a0 inasmuch as they honestly believed that the appellee was occupying these, two small parcels of land as their tenant.\u00a0\u00a0 One of the petitioners went upon the premises with the surveyor when the original plan was made.<br\/><br\/>Proof of constructive fraud is not sufficient to authorize the Court of Land Registration to reopen a case and modify its decree. Specific, intentional acts to deceive and deprive another of his right, or in some manner\u00a0 injure him, must be alleged\u00a0 and proved; that\u00a0 is, there\u00a0 must\u00a0 be actual or positive fraud as\u00a0 distinguished from constructive fraud.<br\/><br\/>The question as to the meaning of the word\u00a0 \"fraud\" in the\u00a0 Australian\u00a0 statutes has been frequently\u00a0 raised.\u00a0\u00a0 Two distinctions have\u00a0 been\u00a0 noted by the Australian courts; the first is the distinction between the\u00a0 meaning\u00a0 of the word \"fraud\" in the\u00a0 sections relating to the conclusive effect of certificates of title, and its meaning in the sections\u00a0 relating to the protection\u00a0 of bona fide\u00a0 purchasers from registered proprietors.\u00a0\u00a0 The second is the distinction between\u00a0 \"legal,\" \"equitable,\" or \"constructive\"\u00a0 fraud,\u00a0 and\u00a0 \"actual\"\u00a0 or \"moral\" fraud.\u00a0\u00a0 In none of the\u00a0 groups of the sections of the\u00a0 Australian\u00a0 statutes\u00a0 relating to the\u00a0 conclusive\u00a0 effect of certificates of title,, and in which fraud is referred to, is there any express indication of the meaning of \"fraud,\" with the sole exception of that of\u00a0 the\u00a0 South Australian group.\u00a0\u00a0 (Hogg\u00a0 on Australian Torrens System,\u00a0 p.\u00a0 834.)<br\/><blockquote>\"With regard to decisions on the sections relating to the conclusive effect of\u00a0 certificates\u00a0 of title, it has\u00a0 been held in some cases that the 'fraud' there mentioned , means actual or moral fraud, not merely constructive or legal fraud.\u00a0\u00a0 In other cases 'fraud'\u00a0 has been\u00a0 said to\u00a0 include\u00a0 constructive, legal, and every kind of fraud.\u00a0\u00a0 In other cases, again, knowledge of other persons' rights, and the deliberate acquisition of registered title in the face of such knowledge, has been held to be 'fraud' which rendered voidable the certificates of title so obtained; and voluntary ignorance is,\u00a0 for this purpose, the same\u00a0 as\u00a0 knowledge.\u00a0 But\u00a0 in\u00a0 none of\u00a0 these three classes of cases was there absent the\u00a0 element of intention\u00a0 to deprive another of just rights, which constitutes the essential characteristics of actual\u00a0 as distinguished\u00a0 from legal-fraud.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Id., p. 835, and cases cited in notes Nos. 85, 86, 87, 88, and 89 at bottom of pages 835 and 836.)<br\/><\/blockquote>By \"fraud\" is meant actual fraud - dishonesty of some sort.\u00a0 (Judgment of Privy Council in Assets Co. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>. Mere Roihi, and Assets Co. <i>vs.<\/i> Panapa Waihopi, decided in March, 1905, cited\u00a0 by Hogg in his\u00a0 Supplementary\u00a0 Addendum to his work on Australian Torrens System, <i>supra<\/i>.)\u00a0 The same meaning should be given to the word \"fraud\" used in section 38 of our statutes (Act No, 496).<br\/><br\/>The question\u00a0 as to whether any particular transaction shows fraud, within the meaning of\u00a0 the\u00a0 word as used in our statutes, will\u00a0 in each case be a question of fact;\u00a0 We will not attempt\u00a0 to say what acts would constitute this kind of fraud\u00a0 in\u00a0 other cases.\u00a0 This must be\u00a0 determined from the\u00a0 facts and circumstances in\u00a0 each particular case. The only\u00a0 question we are called\u00a0 upon to determine, and have determined,\u00a0 is whether\u00a0 or not, under the facts and circumstances in this case,\u00a0 the petitioners did obtain the decree of February 12, 1908, by means of fraud.<br\/><br\/>It might\u00a0 be urged that the appellee has been deprived of his property without due process of law, in violation of section 5 of the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902, known as the \"Philippine Bill,\" which provides\u00a0 \"that no law shall be enacted in the said Islands which shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.\"<br\/><br\/>The Land Registration Act requires that all occupants be named in\u00a0 the petition and given notice by registered mail. This did not do the appellee any good, as he was notitotified; but he\u00a0 was\u00a0 made\u00a0 a party defendant, as we\u00a0 have\u00a0 said, by means of the publication \"to all whom it may concern.\"\u00a0 If this section of the\u00a0 Act is to be upheld this must be declared to be due process of law.<br\/><br\/>Before examining the validity of this part of the Act it might be well to note the history and purposes of what is known as\u00a0 the \"Torrens Land Registration System.\"\u00a0\u00a0 This system\u00a0 was\u00a0 introduced in South\u00a0 Australia by Sir Robert Torrens in 1857 and was there worked out in its practicable form.<br\/><br\/>The main principle of registration is to make registered titles indefeasible.\u00a0 As we have said, upon the presentation in the Court of Land Registration of an application for the registration of the title to lands, under this system, the theory of the law is that all\u00a0 occupants, adjoining owners, adverse claimants, and other interested persons are notified of the proceedings, and have a right to appear in opposition to such\u00a0 application.\u00a0\u00a0 In other words,\u00a0 the proceeding\u00a0 is against the whole world.\u00a0 This system was evidently considered by the Legislature to be a public project when\u00a0 it passed Act No.\u00a0 496.\u00a0 The interest\u00a0 of the\u00a0 community at large was considered to be\u00a0 preferred to that of private individuals.<br\/><blockquote>\"At the close of this nineteenth century all civilized nations are coming to registration of title to land, because immovable property is becoming more and more a matter of commercial dealing, and there can be no trade without security.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Dumas's Lectures,\u00a0 p. 23.)<br\/><br\/>\"The registered proprietor will no longer have reasons to fear that he\u00a0 may\u00a0 be evicted because\u00a0 his\u00a0 vendor had, unknown to him, already sold the\u00a0 land to a third person. *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 The registered proprietor may feel\u00a0 himself protected against any defect in his vendor's title.\"\u00a0 (Id., p. 21.)<br\/><br\/>\"The following summary of\u00a0 benefits of the\u00a0 system\u00a0 of registration of titles, made by Sir Robert Torrens, has been fully justified in\u00a0 its use:<br\/><br\/>\"First. It has substituted security for insecurity.<br\/><br\/>\"Second. It has\u00a0 reduced the\u00a0 cost of conveyances from pounds to shillings, and the time occupied from months to days.<br\/><br\/>\"Third. It has\u00a0 exchanged brevity and clearness for obscurity and verbiage.<br\/><br\/>\"Fourth. It has so simplified ordinary dealings that he who has\u00a0 mastered the 'three R's' can transact his own conveyancing.<br\/><br\/>\"Fifth. It affords protection against fraud.<br\/><br\/>\"Sixth. It has\u00a0 restored to their just value many estates, held under good\u00a0 holding titles, but\u00a0 depreciated in consequence of some blur or technical defect, and has barred the re-occurrence of any similar faults.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Sheldon on Land Registration, pp.\u00a0 75, 76.)<br\/><br\/>\"The boldest effort to\u00a0 grapple with the problem of simplification of title to land\u00a0 was made by\u00a0 Mr. (afterwards Sir Robert)\u00a0 Torrens, a layman, in\u00a0 South Australia in 1857. *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 In the Torrens system <i>title by registration<\/i> takes the place of '<i>title by deeds<\/i>' of the system under the 'general' law.\u00a0\u00a0 A sale of land, for example, is effected by a registered transfer, upon\u00a0 which a certificate of title is\u00a0 issued.\u00a0 The certificate is guaranteed by\u00a0 statute, and,\u00a0 with certain exceptions,\u00a0 constitutes\u00a0 indefeasible\u00a0 title to the land\u00a0 mentioned therein.\u00a0\u00a0 Under the old system\u00a0 the same sale\u00a0 would\u00a0 be effected by\u00a0 a conveyance, depending for its validity, apart from intrinsic flaws, on the correctness\u00a0 of a long series of prior deeds, wills,\u00a0 etc.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 The object of the Torrens system, then, is to\u00a0 do away with the\u00a0 delay, uncertainty, and\u00a0 expense of the\u00a0 old\u00a0 conveyancing system.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Duffy &amp; Eagleson on The Transfer of Land Act, 1890, pp. 2, 3, 5, 7.)<br\/><br\/>\"By 'Torrens' systems generally are meant those systems of registration of transactions with interest in land whose declared object\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 is, under governmental authority, to establish\u00a0 and certify to the ownership\u00a0 of an absolute and indefeasible\u00a0 title to realty, and\u00a0 to\u00a0 simplify\u00a0 its\u00a0 transfer.\" (Hogg on Australian Torrens System, <i>supra,<\/i>\u00a0 pp. 1, 2.)<\/blockquote>Compensation for\u00a0 errors from assurance\u00a0 funds\u00a0 is provided in all countries in which the Torrens system has been enacted.\u00a0\u00a0 Cases of error\u00a0 no doubt will always occur.\u00a0 The percentage\u00a0 of\u00a0 errors, as compared\u00a0 with\u00a0 the number\u00a0 of registered dealings in Australia,\u00a0 is very\u00a0 small.\u00a0 In\u00a0 New South\u00a0 Wales there were,\u00a0 in 1889, 209,894 registered\u00a0 dealings, the average risk of error being only 2 1\/2 cents for each dealing.\u00a0 In Queensland the risk of error was only 14 cents, the number\u00a0 of registered dealings being 233,309.\u00a0\u00a0 In\u00a0 Tasmania\u00a0 and in Western Australia not a\u00a0 cent was paid for compensation for errors during the whole time of operation,.

Woodward, George Wilson, and Edward T. Clark, all of said cavalry troop (Troop F), producing a wound in the head of Sergeant William Hoey, in the left shoulder of George Wilson, in the hips of Thomas F. Woodward, and one wound in the head and another in the abdomen of Edward T. Clark, by reason of which said wounds so received said above-named individuals, and each of them, died\u2014the first instantly, the second at 1.15 p. m. of the same day, the third at 2 p. m., and the fourth on the 14th day of said month of May. In addition, said shots occasioned wounds in the right loin and right forearm, respectively, of soldiers Damper and Whipple.\"<\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>On July 10, 1908, upon being arraigned on the foregoing information, the defendant entered a plea of not guilty, and the case was set for trial. On July 16, 1908, when the case was called for trial, the prosecution asked and was granted leave to sever the charge and file a separate complaint for the shooting of each of the persons named in the above information. There being no objection on the part of the defendant to this procedure, the motion was granted, and separate complaints were filed, to each of which the defendant then and there pleaded not guilty and the trial proceeded. During the trial the following stipulation was made between the Government and the counsel for the defendant.<\/p> <blockquote> <p>\"It is stipulated by the parties that the evidence presented by each side in this case, No. 589 (R. G. No. 5161), United States <em>vs<\/em>. Mike Beecham, be applicable in all respects to each and all of the other cases with the same title, being Nos. 609, 610, and 611. This stipulation is made with the consent of the court.\"<\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>As a result of the trial then and there had before the Hon. Julio Llorente, the court, on the 29th day of October, 1908, found the defendant guilty of the crime charged and sentenced him to the penalty of <em>cadena perpetua,<\/em> with the proper accessory penalties, the same sentence being recorded in each of the four cases, each sentence providing that all four sentences should be served simultaneously, but that the maximum time of imprisonment should not exceed forty years. From the judgment of conviction and the thus imposed sentence this appeal is taken.<\/p> <p>There does not seem to be serious dispute as to the main facts in this case. They are:<\/p> <p>On May 11, 1908, the date of the shooting, the defendant, an American, 28 years of age, was serving his third enlistment as a soldier in the United States Army, being then a member of Troop F, First United States Cavalry, stationed at Camp Stotsenberg, Province of Pampanga, Philippine Islands.<\/p> <p>The plan of the barracks occupied by Troop F at the date of the occurrence is shown by the plan hereto attached.<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> It will be observed from said plan that the barracks consist of two main apartments, the squad room and the dining room, connected by a covered passageway about 12 feet in length by 7 in width. The length of the dining room is 60 feet. In its southeast corner, directly in line with the passageway, is a barber shop. In the southwest corner is a kitchen.<\/p> <p>About half-past 12 of the day in question, after the men had finished their noon mess, the deceased Clark and Woodward were seated in the window of the mess room, marked \"1\" in the plan, facing the interior and engaged in conversation with the deceased, Hoey, and a witness named Merritt. These two were standing at the side of the window, side by side. Both had their backs toward the hallway from which the defendant entered. No witness was able to locate the precise position of deceased Wilson at the time he was shot, but from the evidence in the case it appears well established that he was located in the east end of the dining room, near the barber shop.<\/p> <p>Besides Merritt, the following witnesses testified as to the shooting:<\/p> <p>Furze, who was seated on his cot in the squad room, marked \"6\" in the plan.<\/p> <p>Damper and Whipple, who were in the barber shop, the latter seated in the chair while his hair was being cut by the former.<\/p> <p>Queenth, who was getting a drink at a water tank which was located in the passageway referred to, marked \"3\" in the plan.<\/p> <p>Garrett and Swartz, who at the time were engaged in a game of billiards in the dining room, marked \"2\" in the plan.<\/p> <p>Plesser, who was in the kitchen.<\/p> <p>The first person to observe anything extraordinary was Merritt. Merritt testified that his attention was attracted by heavy steps behind him, causing him to turn his face toward the passageway from which the sound came. There he saw defendant approaching through the passageway with a gun. He saw him raise the gun and, as Hoey turned his face to see who was approaching, discharge it directly into his face. He saw Hoey fall to the floor, where he remained motionless, and then saw defendant quickly extract the discharged cartridge and fire a second shot. Upon the firing of the first shot Merritt saw Clark and Woodward spring from the window sill upon which they were seated and run toward the door of the barber shop. Upon their leaving the window sill, witness himself leaned his body over it, and while in that position heard defendant exclaim, \"Get away from in front of me; let me get that * * *.\" He also heard something fall, the defendant's exclamation, the second shot and the sound of the falling body being quickly followed by a third shot. Upon hearing this third shot the witness raised up and looking toward the barber shop saw there the defendant standing with his gun pointed downward. Thereupon the defendant turned and walked rapidly toward the squad room. After the defendant had gone the witness found Woodward stretched at full length on the floor, face downward, with his body halfway through the door of the barber shop. Clark was lying in the barber shop with his feet in the doorway, apparently dead.<\/p> <p>Witness Furze, who was seated at his bunk in the squad room, heard <em>one gunshot<\/em> followed by <em>two others,<\/em> whereupon he proceeded toward the mess room and to the point where Hoey's body lay, and from this position saw defendant standing in the doorway of the barber shop with his gun pointed downward at a person prostrate on the floor. The witness then ran away in fright.<\/p> <p>Witness Queenth, who was at the water tank in the passageway, noticed the defendant pass by him with his gun, and, when two or three steps beyond him toward the dining room, raise his gun to a firing position and discharge it. Witness did not know at the time whether he aimed at any particular person or not. While the witness was still at the tank the defendant discharged his gun a <em>second time, whereupon witness saw two men fall in the doorway of the barber shop.<\/em> Witness, being frightened, then ran away.<\/p> <p>Witness Damper, who was cutting Whipple's hair in the barber shop, upon <em>hearing a shot<\/em> stepped toward the door but, upon being struck on the right thumb by a <em>second shot,<\/em> turned and leaped through the barber shop window.<\/p> <p>Witness Whipple, who was seated in the barber chair, heard shots from the direction of the mess room, and, finding himself hit in the right arm by either the <em>first<\/em> or <em>second<\/em> shot, leaped out of the barber shop window, following Damper.<\/p> <p>Witness Garrett, at the billiard table, marked \"2\" in the plan, was standing with his back toward the window, marked \"1\" in the plan. Upon the discharge of the first shot he turned and saw the defendant in the passageway, marked \"3\" in the plan. After firing the first shot the witness saw the defendant walk into the dining room to the point where Hoey was lying on the floor and there fire a second shot. Witness then escaped through the kitchen.<\/p> <p>Witness Swartz, who was playing billiards with Garrett, also heard the first shot and saw the defendant come into the dining room with his gun raised in a firing position. Seeing Hoey fall, the witness started toward the door of the kitchen and as he turned toward the kitchen door he noticed Wilson and heard another shot.<\/p> <p>Witness Plesser was in the kitchen, where he heard two shots, whereupon Wilson came running into the kitchen exclaiming, \"I am wounded.\"<\/p> <p>The last two witnesses are the only persons who testify to having seen Wilson at all.<\/p> <p>The defendant, upon being asked on cross-examination to point out on the plan hereto adjoined where Wilson stood at the time when he claimed to have fired at him, answered: \"It is not necessary for me to see the plan, <em>because I can not point out where he was when I fired at him.\"<\/em><\/p> <p>One witness spoke with the defendant, just before he began shooting, and another immediately after the shooting was concluded. The former, witness Steward, saw the defendant in the water-closet in the rear of the dining room. Steward testified that while defendant was in the closet he asked defendant for some toilet paper, and that defendant on handing him the paper said, \"Take it quickly, for I am going to attend to a matter.\" Witness Quiery met defendant in the squad room immediately after the shooting, and the defendant called out to him, saying, \"At last I have got two.\"<\/p> <p>Respecting the character of the wounds that resulted from defendant's shots, the post doctor, Allen Macy Smith, testified that Hoey's death was instantaneous and was caused by a gunshot wound, the ball entering at the point of the nose, completely tearing away the right side of the face. He testified that Clark received two shots, one in the fleshy part of the abdomen, the other entering the left jaw and passing out through the right jaw, traversing the tongue and completely destroying the right side of the face. The wound indicated that the weapon was discharged very near the face. Clark died within three days. The doctor testified that Woodward was shot completely through the hips or loins, dying within an hour and a half. Wilson received a wound in the back, the ball entering the left shoulder and producing death within an hour and a half.<\/p> <p>For some weeks prior to May 11th the relations between the defendant and the deceased William Hoey were strained, and upon the part of defendant, at least, very bitter, owing to offensive conduct on the part of the defendant toward the deceased Edward T. Clark, on account of which the defendant incurred repeated reprimands from Sergeant Hoey. As to the nature of the offensive conduct which occasioned the trouble between himself and Hoey, the evidence introduced by the prosecution tended to show that the defendant made indecent proposals to the deceased Clark, who was a youth of only 17 years, which broke off the previous friendly relations existing between the defendant and Clark. Thereafter the defendant persisted in annoying Clark, with the result that Clark protested to Sergeant Hoey and appealed to him for protection. Responsive to Clark's appeals, Hoey threatened the defendant at various times with punishment, and on one occasion told him that he would place him under arrest if he continued to annoy Clark. On another occasion he told the defendant that he would report the matter to the captain in charge of the troop if he did not cease his offensive conduct toward Clark.<\/p> <p>In testifying as a witness on his own behalf, the defendant claimed that one of his grievances against Sergeant Hoey was that for some weeks prior to the shooting the sergeant frequently reprimanded him while on drill and assigned him to the worst kind of work there was to be done. He also claimed that one of the series of persecutions which induced him to shoot the sergeant was an occurrence that took place at target practice on the morning of May 11th, the day of the shooting. On that morning, according to the defendant, at between 8 and 9 o'clock, a dispute arose between him and the sergeant while the troop was on duty, and the defendant then and there challenged the sergeant to a fight with fists, which the sergeant declined. The defendant also claims that after they had returned from target practice and had taken their midday meal, and just prior to the shooting, defendant passed the window of the mess room, marked \"1\" on the plan, on his way toward the water-closet in the rear of the mess room; that on his way to the closet he saw Hoey standing near the window talking with other soldiers; that as he returned from the closet to the squad room, where his gun and ammunition were, he claims on passing the window to have heard the sergeant make a vile remark with reference to him, but which remark did not induce in him any particular feeling of resentment. On arriving at the squad room he claims to have gone to the point marked \"8\" in the plan, testifying that on that day he had his cot there, although witness Barner testifies that the usual place for his cot was at point \"7.\" While at point \"8,\" he claims that he saw Hoey, while standing at the said window, turn in the direction of the squad room and make up a face at him. It was at this instant, he claims, that he decided to kill Hoey <em>and Wilson,<\/em> and proceeded forthwith to carry out his resolution. The shooting followed as soon as he could get his gun and load it.<\/p> <p>Respecting the alleged provocation which brought him to the resolution to kill not only Hoey but Wilson, witness Merritt, who is the only survivor of the three men who were in conversation with Hoey at the time of the vile remark and insulting gesture testified to by the defendant, swore on rebuttal that he neither heard the remark attributed by the defendant to Hoey nor saw Hoey make up a face, as alleged by the defendant.<\/p> <p>As to his motive for shooting Wilson, the defendant claims that he did not receive any provocation from Wilson on the day of the shooting, and also admits that Wilson had been his friend prior to the trouble that resulted with Clark, but claims that since that time Wilson had turned against him and had repeatedly charged him with making improper proposals to youths.<\/p> <p>Respecting the shooting of Clark and Woodward, the defendant claims that this was an accident; that he had no motive for desiring the death of either of these two men and did not intend to harm them and was not aware that he had done so until some days after the shooting.<\/p> <p>It is conceded that the defendant is guilty of murder. The only question for our consideration is the penalty that should be imposed under the law. There is no extenuating circumstance disclosed. In order to impose the maximum penalty there must be present at least one aggravating circumstance. The crime being clearly qualified by <em>alevosia,<\/em> it is necessary to determine whether or not there is present the aggravating circumstance of premeditation, there concededly being present no other aggravating circumstance. For that purpose it is necessary, first, to decide whether or not there was a present provocation inducing of itself the killing\u2014in other words, whether the defendant killed in the heat of passion. We look first at his own testimony.<\/p> <p>The defendant testified in part as follows:<\/p> <blockquote> <p>\"For six months I had friendly relations with Sergeant Hoey. After that those relations gradually changed. I noticed it first when he began to reprimand me during the instruction and whenever he could. He had not done this before. I also noticed that he began to assign me to the worst kind of work which he had to do. For a month this is all I noticed. After that he began to make remarks about me, saying that I was accustomed to make improper proposals to young boys. He made these remarks in particular to Clark and Wilson and to me myself when nobody else was present. He also made up faces at me and showed me his teeth in order to irritate me. He also threatened to send me to prison for ten years. For a long time I had friendly relations with Wilson. Two or three months before the 11th of May those relations began to change. He also then began to make personal remarks about me. He began by making them to me personally. These personal remarks consisted in his saying that I was accustomed to make improper proposals to young boys. Up to that time I had had no difficulty with him. I was having a discussion with Sergeant Hoey at the target practice on the occasion on which he made the personal remarks that I have just referred to, to which I replied that if he would come to where I was, or behind the trench, we would arrange our difficulty. He answered me that that was not necessary and that he was able to arrange matters with me in some other way. This conversation took place during the morning of the 11th of May. My relations with Clark had always been those which one brother has for another. He was about 17 years of age and we had always been the very best of friends. About three weeks before the 11th of May those relations began to change. Hoey and Wilson were the ones who caused it.<\/p> <p>\"On the 11th of May, in the forenoon, we had target practice at about 7 o'clock in the morning. At the time I went to the place where the target practice occurred I had no ammunition. There I received a receptacle containing sixty loaded cartridges. We returned from the target practice at about 11 o'clock.\"<\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>After relating how he occupied himself just prior to the shooting, defendant testified further as follows:<\/p> <blockquote> <p>\"I then went to the water-closet from the barber shop. In passing from the barber shop to the closet I went through the east part of the dining room and passed out by the stairway which is situated at the side where the word 'steps' is marked on the plan. I then turned to the right, returned to the front part of the dining room and went directly to the water-closet. In passing from the barber shop to the water-closet I saw Sergeant Hoey standing in the dining room in front of a window, marked '1' in the plan. I had no conversation with him, and he said nothing to me at that time. I do not remember who else was standing there but there were various soldiers and I am quite sure that Wilson was one of them. In the water-closet I met Steward and I remember sitting upon one of the seats beside him. In a few minutes I arose, but before arising Steward asked me for some paper and then I returned to the squad room. In passing to the squad room I passed near to the window marked '1' in the plan. I saw there Sergeant Hoey, who was standing in front of the window. On seeing me pass he said <em>'alli va uno que acostumbra a mamarla,'<\/em> referring to me. I saw several there with Hoey, but do not remember at this moment their names. I then entered the squad room, went to where my gun was and got it. I then went to the place where my bed was for the purpose of cleaning my gun. In looking for some things to clean the gun I looked toward where I saw Hoey standing at the side of the door of the dining room. I was at the place marked '8' on the plan. From that place I was able to see the door where Hoey stood. On turning toward me Hoey made up a face at me, the same as he usually did. I then seized my cartridge belt and took out five cartridges. At that time I had my gun in my hands. I loaded my rifle with the cartridges and went to the door of the dining room. My intention then was to kill Hoey and Wilson. The intention to kill them arose at the time when Hoey made the face at me. I then lost my reason. Prior to that time I had no intention whatever to cause such injury to Wilson or Hoey. The first time I thought of killing Wilson and Hoey was at the time that Hoey turned and made a face at me. I went slowly to the door which led to the dining room and discharged the first shot at Sergeant Hoey. The second shot I discharged at Wilson. From that moment I do not remember what I did. I remember meeting Captain Babcock after the shooting. He ordered me to drop my gun and I did so. I do not remember how many shots I fired. I do not remember having recognized any other persons at the time except Hoey and Wilson. I do not remember clearly what happened until I found myself in the guardroom one and one-half hours after the event. It was eight or nine days after the event before I was informed of what had occurred.\"<\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>On cross-examination the defendant testified:<\/p> <blockquote> <p>\"I do not remember having entered the barber shop and I only remember discharging two shots. I did not go there to kill Clark because my relations with Clark were those of an older brother to a younger. It was on the 11th of May at the place of the target practice that I offered to fight with Sergeant Hoey. This was about 8 or 9 o'clock in the morning. It was about half past 2 when I shot him. At 9 o'clock I had no intention to kill him. I had no resentment against Hoey by reason of his reprimanding me nor by reason of his threatening me on account of my actions toward Clark. After a little while the charge that I was having improper relations with Clark caused me indignation. Natural indignation has its limits and when I saw Hoey make up a face at me natural indignation reached its limits. My indignation and resentment were gradually increased until they arrived at the extreme limit when he made up the face at me. Wilson had not made up a face at me but I concluded to kill him at the same time that I did Hoey. Although Wilson had not made a face at me, still he had done other things which would have justified my action not only on the part of myself but on the part of others who have more moderate tempers than I have. Wilson accused me at various times of having made immoral propositions to young boys. He had also accused me of a crime which in my judgment could not be pardoned by God or man. For those reasons I decided to kill him. I shot first at Hoey. My second shot was at Wilson. Before the shooting I saw Wilson once in the dining room, so that when I went there I knew he was there. I was not able to see him from the squad room. It is not necessary to show me the plan because I am unable to show where Wilson was when I shot him, but I am able to say that he was in the dining room. I saw Quiery after the shooting and it is probable that I said to him that I had got two at last, but I do not recall at this moment whether I said it to him or not. I did not shoot the other soldiers. It was a very extraordinary circumstance that I should have done what I did. It is very probable that I said to Quiery that I had got two of them. I do not remember having been in the barber shop and having seen Clark lying on the floor, nor do I remember having discharged a shot at Clark while he was lying on the floor.\"<\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>From the inherent nature of defendant's own evidence, it is apparent that there was no present provocation such as would in any way permit him to offer the excuse that he killed in the heat of passion. The provocation which he urges, even if real, was absurdly inadequate of itself to produce the result he contends for. Moreover, it is perfectly apparent from such testimony that the cause of the killing was not the one alleged, but consisted of a series of different occurrences affecting the relations between the defendant and his victims, leading to and producing in him the bitterest and most malignant feelings toward his alleged persecutors. This subject will be more fully discussed when we deal with premeditation.<\/p> <p>In determining the question of present provocation, we look, second, at the other evidence of the case and the attendant circumstances.<\/p> <p>It is seen from the testimony of the defendant himself, that he claims to have formed the purpose of killing Hoey and Wilson just before the shooting, the formation of said resolution having been caused solely by Hoey making a face at him. From his own testimony and from all the circumstances of this case, it is impossible to accept this claim, because the testimony which the defendant gives in assigning the cause for his resolution to kill is contradicted by substantially all of the other testimony of the case and by all of the circumstances connected therewith:<\/p> <ol><li>The claim on the part of the defendant that Hoey made up a face at him is undoubtedly false. The statement of the defendant that Hoey made the insulting remark above mentioned has been clearly proved to be untrue. Merritt, who stood at Hoey's side at the time the alleged remark was made by him to the defendant, and who was much nearer to Hoey than the defendant himself was, testified directly that he heard no such remark. It is undoubted that if such remark had been made Merritt would have heard it. That statement having been shown to be wholly untrue, we would, even if there was no other evidence, have every reason for discrediting his statement about the gesture which he claims Hoey made. But we have testimony on that subject. Merritt testified that he did not see Hoey make up a face at the defendant. This gesture would probably have been seen by Merritt if it had really been made. If Hoey had deliberately turned around and made up a face at defendant, it is more than probable that Merritt would have noted the act. In addition, it is extremely doubtful, even if the face had been made, that the defendant would have been able to see it from the point at which he claims he was at the time of the alleged occurrence. It will be observed from the plan that the distance between Hoey and the defendant at the time of the alleged grimace was at least 40 feet. In order to see the gesture complained of it was necessary for the defendant to look completely across the squad room, through two doorways and through a hall 12 feet long and about 7 feet wide. In that hallway was at the time a water barrel or tank and at that tank was standing a soldier, directly in the line of vision between the defendant and the place where he claims Hoey was standing. Moreover, the east end of the dining room, it will be observed from the plan, extends beyond the hallway a distance of 3 or 4 feet. Woodward and Clark were sitting in the window at the east end of the dining room. At the side of the window and near them were standing Hoey and Merritt, conversing with them. They were not standing out into the body of the room directly in front of the window. They were standing at the side of the window. That being the case, Hoey, at the time it is claimed that he made the wry face, could not have been standing any distance west of the east line of the hallway, even if he had been standing directly in front of Clark and Woodward. From the evidence, however, it appears, as we have said, that Merritt was standing at the <em>side<\/em> of the window and Hoey was beside him. That Merritt was at the <em>side<\/em> of the window is further indicated by the fact that immediately after the first shot he <em>leaned out of the same window.<\/em> It is not at all probable that defendant could at the time in question have seen Hoey at all, much less his face. <p><\/p><\/li><li>The defendant admits that no particular indignation was raised in his mind when he heard the vile remark which he says Hoey flung at him. He claims that he went about his usual and ordinary duties after that time and was on the point of cleaning his rifle when he saw Hoey make up the face referred to. It is very improbable that if the remark referred to, which was a remark as vile and insulting as any that could possibly be flung at a man, failed to stir up the ire of the defendant, the simple act of making up a face would have been sufficient to do it.<p><\/p> <p><\/p><\/li><li>Prior to the time when the alleged remark was made and the alleged act of Hoey performed, the defendant made a remark to witness Steward in the water-closet which, taken in connection with the subsequent acts of the defendant, throws a flood of light not only upon the state of mind of the defendant at that time but also upon the question whether there was a present provocation or not on the part of Hoey. Witness Steward being in the water-closet with defendant just <em>prior to the time when the gesture is alleged to have been made,<\/em> he asked defendant for some toilet paper and he, in giving him the paper, said, \"Hurry up and take it, because I have a matter to attend to.\" He immediately went from there to the squad room, got his gun, and shot all of his enemies and more.<p><\/p> <p><\/p><\/li><li>Even if there had been a present provocation on the part of Hoey, there was admittedly none on the part of Wilson or Clark. It is entirely clear to our minds that the same cause which impelled the defendant to kill Hoey animated him to kill Clark. That cause was not the bad face which it is alleged Hoey made up at the defendant.<p><\/p> <p><\/p><\/li><li>The alleged provocation was wholly inadequate to incite the defendant to the frightful slaughter which he thereafter executed. Such cause being entirely inadequate to produce the result which the defendant claims it did produce, we must presume and hold, in the absence of trustworthy evidence to the contrary, that it could not and did not affect that result.<\/li><\/ol><p><\/p> <p>It conclusively appearing from defendant's own testimony, and from the other evidence and the attendant circumstances, that there was no present provocation for the deed which the defendant committed, his murderous act must be referred to some other cause. The question of the real cause of the murder is so closely allied to the question of premeditation that we shall discuss them together.<\/p> <p>The last trouble which occurred between Hoey and the defendant took place between 8 and 9 o'clock in the morning, as the shooting occurred at about 1 o'clock in the afternoon. Nothing whatever transpired during those intervening hours between the defendant and any of his victims. He had no more reason to shoot Hoey or his other victims at 1 o'clock than he had at 9. It is undoubted also that the trouble which occurred in the morning was not of itself and alone the provoking cause of the shooting. It seems to us that it is the unavoidable inference and inevitable conclusion from defendant's own testimony that the trouble of the morning was not the immediate cause of his act, but was rather one of a series of occurrences beginning many weeks before which had created in defendant a hatred of Hoey and his other victims deep seated and malignant. The defendant was a passionate man, violent in temper and strong in his prejudices. According to his own admission, for many weeks he had been laboring under the fixed belief that the men whom he subsequently killed had been guilty of conduct toward him that was wholly unpardonable by God or man. He says that he had come to a point in his relations with them when his nature had reached its limits. He had brooded over his wrongs and nurtured them with his wrath until they were mountain high. It is impossible to mistake or doubt the motive or cause of the defendant's terrible act. His own testimony certifies to it too clearly for error. Did he desire justice for the wrongs that had been done him and protection from further persecutions in the future? If so, he did not seek it as reasonable and honest men seek it. He was admittedly a soldier of several years' experience. He knew that he could obtain an impartial hearing at the hands of his superior officers if he had really been wronged. He unquestionably knew the procedure by which that could be done. He knew that thereby he could protect himself from the persecutions of Hoey and the rest. He knew that he had an easy and adequate remedy at hand which would not only insure him against further molestations but would also secure the punishment of his persecutors for what they had already done. Yet, knowing all this, he made no complaint and lodged no charges with the proper authorities. The fact necessarily is that he was not seeking justice or protection for himself or the proper and adequate punishment of his defamers. He wanted more. He wanted to take the law into his own hands. He wanted vengeance. He wanted to wreak upon his enemies a punishment so frightful as would glut to the full that consuming desire. It is undoubted from his own evidence and from his own acts that the motive which dominated the whole man was revenge pure and simple. No other cause or motive existed. The whole case discloses no other. On the contrary, every proved fact leads to that conclusion. No other result could possibly be reached. So frightfully out of proportion to wrongs done him was the redress which he took, and so recklessly brutal was the method of its accomplishment, as to demonstrate with perfect clearness, apart from any other fact or circumstance, the violent passion which ruled him at the time.<\/p> <p>Having arrived at the conclusion that vengeance was the motive or cause impelling the defendant to his fatal act, premeditation, as defined by law, becomes under the circumstances of this case a necessary ingredient of the crime. It needs no argument to establish the proposition that when one believes that he has received an injury at the hands of others so terrible in its character as to be unpardonable and to tax the limits of human nature to endure it, and that state of mind and feeling have continued for weeks, there must be deliberation, meditation, and reflection; and, if that state of mind is followed by an act against the authors of that injury provoked by no new cause, that act must, of necessity, be the result of such deliberation, meditation, and reflection. It is impossible to believe that the defendant, driven by such a motive, arrived at the resolution to kill without having fully and thoroughly considered from every point of view the course which his vengeance should take. It is a mental impossibility to arrive at the point of killing a human being, reached by reason of injuries inflicted during a period of several months, inducing a malignant spirit of revenge, without having, so far as the human mind is capable of so doing, thoroughly and repeatedly considered the question whether or not the crime should be committed. The limits of human endurance can not be reached to the extent of causing a violent, unnatural, and criminal act except by previous deliberation, meditation, and reflection <em>in the absence of some present exciting cause.<\/em> Every voluntary act which is not produced by a present exciting cause is necessarily a part of some anterior state of mind and is a legitimate product thereof. It is admitted by the defendant in this case that he had been so much affected mentally by the persecutions of his victims that he had arrived at the limit of his nature's endurance, and that that limit was reached and passed by the provocation (the made-up face) which he received from Hoey just prior to the killing. The question presents itself, What does he mean by limit? We can judge only by what he said, what he did, and what he testified to. By limit he evidently means a point at which and beyond which he was unable to restrain himself from killing. Before he reached that point he was able to prevent himself from killing his persecutors. After he had reached or passed that point he was not able to prevent himself from killing them. In other words, the question of limit was to him a question of killing. This is necessarily so because <em>when he did reach the limit he killed.<\/em> To him the limit meant death to his enemies. This means nothing more nor less than that the concept of killing was presented to his mind over and over again in determining whether or not his enemies up to a given point had done enough to deserve death at his hands. Although he was a passionate and headstrong man, still he was calculating to a degree. He did not act hastily. He proceeded slowly. At each new insult he passed upon the question of what should be the punishment of his persecutors\u2014he determined whether he could longer endure their persecutions. Now, defendant claims that the limit was reached, that his resolution to kill was made, just prior to the killing; and he assigns as a reason and the sole reason why the limit was suddenly reached at that time, the provocation which he claims to have received from Hoey, namely, the face which Hoey made at him. But, inasmuch as we have already found, after a careful consideration of the evidence, <em>that there was no such provocation,<\/em> then it necessarily follows that the defendant assigned a false reason for the killing. It shows, moreover, that he not only did that but that he also assigned <em>a false time as to when his resolution to kill was formed.<\/em> Instead of the resolution to kill being formed at the very time of the killing, it must, rather, have been formed some considerable time prior thereto. If the defendant was able to keep from resolving to kill up to and including the last injury, which occurred between 8 and 9 o'clock in the morning, then absolutely nothing occurred to tax his endurance further up to the time of the killing: in other words, nothing further occurred to induce him to come to a resolution to kill. The same causes inducing him to kill operated on his mind at 9 o'clock as operated on his mind at 1 o'clock. If, then, he did not kill at 9 o'clock, it was not because he did not have at that time a cause to kill which to him was entirely sufficient, but for some other reason\u2014such, for example, as the lack of opportunity to kill <em>both<\/em> of his enemies before his hand could be stayed. All that he had at 1 o'clock that he did not have at 9 o'clock <em>was the opportunity to kill both of his enemies instead of one of them.<\/em> This opportunity presented itself to him with striking force when he passed the window of the dining room and saw his alleged persecutors, Hoey and Clark, talking together, with so few other soldiers present as to make it highly probable that he would be able to conduct the long-contemplated slaughter to its frightful conclusion unmolested. The only conclusion permitted by the proofs is that the defendant at 9 o'clock lacked, <em>not the resolution, but the opportunity.<\/em><\/p> <p>Besides the evidence inherent in the situation we have before us other proofs showing that, even before the provocation which the defendant alleges he received from Hoey just prior to the killing, he had resolved to kill as he did kill. After passing Hoey in the dining room and receiving, as he alleges, the grossly insulting remark which Hoey directed toward him, the defendant, still, as he claims, without the resolution to kill, entered the water-closet and took a seat near another soldier named Steward. The latter asked the defendant to hand him some toilet paper. This the defendant did, saying with apparent excitement as he did so, \"Hurry up and take it as I have a matter to attend to.\" He immediately left the closet, went straightway and got his gun and murdered those whom he had already marked as his victims. Can there be doubt as to what that \"matter\" was? Moreover, and as another circumstance showing his forethought, when he had finished his slaughter and was returning to the squad room with his gun he met the witness Quiery, to whom he said, \"At last I have got two.\" The words \"at last\" are of the very deepest significance. They indicate the satisfaction which one feels on having achieved a purpose long had in view and for the consummation of which he had long been waiting. What more indicative of long waiting, of delayed hope, of impatient longing, of anxious thought and meditation, than those two words? They are in themselves, in view of all the circumstances of this case, as demonstrative of premeditation, deliberation and reflection as words could well be. They were involuntarily spoken at a time when no defense was thought of and when the whole soul of the man abandoned itself to an expression of the most utter satisfaction at the consummation of a thing so long and so devoutly wished. Moreover, the sentence used includes the idea of a plan as well as a purpose. He did not want <em>one;<\/em> he wanted <em>two.<\/em> The opportunity to get one had presented itself many times before\u2014in fact, many times that very day. He had laid his plans for two. If his ingenuity could prevent it he was not going to be hanged for killing <em>one<\/em> man and thus leave his vengeance half appeased, when by judiciously and carefully biding his time he could satiate to the full his consuming passion by murdering <em>two<\/em> and still suffer no greater penalty. His was the game of a calculating as well as a desperate and vengeful man\u2014to lose his own life in order that two other men lose theirs. But it must be <em>two,<\/em> not <em>one.<\/em> His revenge could not be satisfied with half its demands.<\/p> <p>From the words \"I have got two\" can not be drawn the inference that they were used to indicate that he expected to get more. Not at all. At the moment of uttering those words he knew that he would never get anybody else. They indicate rather the successful termination of a long waiting during which he often had the opportunity to get one but not two. They indicate clearly that he was biding his time until he should find the two together so as to permit the destruction of both in so short a time as would forestall interference. That time and opportunity came when he saw his victims together, unarmed and defenseless, so nearly alone as to assure him that at last his vengeance could exact its own. This was what he had been waiting for, to get the two together. This was the situation to which those words referred.<\/p> <p>The fact is that the defendant, by his own evidence, as well as by his acts and words, has laid open before us his mental attitude and processes for the whole time during which these alleged grievances were taking root, as well as down to the time of the killing. Premeditation is nothing more or less than a mental process\u2014a series of mental attitudes. As already stated, we have those mental attitudes and those mental processes clearly spread before us. Under such circumstances, whether there is premeditation or not hardly reaches the dignity of a conclusion.<\/p> <p>Touching finally the question of premeditation.<\/p> <p>We said a moment ago that the words of the defendant indicated a plan of action as well as deliberation and premeditation over a contemplated criminal act. That plan of action, and, therefore, premeditation and deliberation as well, are also disclosed by his acts, words, and testimony. It is evident from the record in this case that when the defendant came to think over the defense he should make upon his trial, he began immediately to consider how he could smooth over the rough places in his case. An attempt to cover up nothing is foolish. It does not concur with the common sense or the common activities of mankind. When an attempt is made to cover up the evidence showing the existence of a thing, the necessary presumption follows that such a thing exists or existed. If it clearly appears in this case that the defendant sought and endeavored to obliterate the traces of design and premeditation, then we may confidently assume that there was design and premeditation. The effort to obliterate traces of a plan and to destroy evidence of premeditation and deliberation is proof as strong as direct evidence in favor of their existence. There appears in this case abundant evidence of attempts upon the part of the defendant to avoid the inference of premeditation:<\/p> <ol><li>He falsely substitutes Wilson in the place of Clark as one of the two men whom he admitted after the killing he intended to kill. <p>The witness Merritt was looking directly at the defendant when he fired his first shot. He saw defendant extract the empty cartridge and again raise his gun to fire. At that moment Merritt leaned out of the window from which Woodward and Clark had fled. His testimony, therefore, is not clear as to whether or not he first heard the exclamation of the defendant to get out of the way or the sound of the falling bodies of Woodward and Clark. The second shot and the exclamation and the sound of the falling bodies were doubtless so near together that the witness is uncertain as to the order in which they occurred; but he is sure that the exclamation, the second shot, and the sound of the falling bodies were followed by a third shot and that when he looked up immediately thereafter he saw defendant standing in the barber shop with his gun pointed downward. Witness Furze, who was at his cot in the squad room, heard one shot, followed by two others. Proceeding to investigate the cause of the shooting, he reached the place in the mess room where Hoey's body lay and saw defendant in the barber shop standing over the prostrate body of Clark with his gun pointed downward. Merritt and Furze thus corroborate one another as to there having been three shots fired and as to the fact that after the firing of the third shot the defendant stood with his gun pointed downward toward Clark, who was lying on the floor of the barber shop. The fact that Woodward and Clark fell upon the discharge of the second shot is further corroborated by witness Queenth, who stood by the water tank and heard the second shot fired, and, before he turned and ran away and before he distinguished the third shot, saw the two men fall in the door of the barber shop. Clark, it will be remembered, had a wound in the abdomen and another in his face. From their location the two wounds must necessarily have been made by different shots. Since Clark fell upon the firing of the second shot, and since after the firing of the third shot the defendant was seen standing over Clark with his gun pointed downward, the inference is unavoidable that the wound through Clark's head was made by the third shot. It will be remembered also that the witness Doctor Smith stated that this wound was of such a character that it must have been made when the gun was close to the face. The shot that killed Hoey was not the one that caused Clark and Woodward to fall, because after the first shot was fired they leaped from the window sill and ran toward the barber shop. It must, therefore, have been the second shot that went through the body of Woodward and grazed the abdomen of Clark, causing the two men to fall. The two men who were in the barber shop heard the first shot before they were wounded and escaped out of the window before they saw anyone in the barber shop or heard the third shot. The shot that passed through Woodward's loins and grazed Clark's abdomen must then have been the shot which also lightly wounded these two men, one in the hand and the other in the arm. The locality of these wounds conforms to the theory that they were made by a shot fired upon a plane that passed through the hips of Woodward and the abdomen of Clark. Thus, the testimony of the three witnesses, Merritt, Furze, and Queenth, the location and number of the wounds, and the testimony of Damper and Whipple, are corroborative of the theory that the second shot fired by the defendant resulted in the killing of Woodward and the wounding of Clark in the abdomen.<\/p> <p>As to the first shot, the only certain data disclosed by the evidence is that Wilson received a fatal wound in the back of the left shoulder and that he succeeded in reaching the kitchen, where Plesser was, before the third shot was fired. The location of the wound in the shoulder demonstrates that it could not have been made by the shot that passed through Woodward's hips and grazed Clark's abdomen. Neither could it have been made by the third shot, that being the one that killed Clark. It must, therefore, have been made by the shot that was aimed at Hoey and that passed out through the side of his face. This shot, according to the evidence, was directed toward the barber shop, whither Wilson may have been going at the time. The defendant admits that he does not know where Wilson was when he claimed he aimed his gun at him. This, of course, would be true if the shot that he aimed at Hoey's face was the one that struck Wilson in the back, causing him to turn and run toward the kitchen while the defendant was trying to get at Clark with his second and third shots. It should also be noted carefully that defendant claims that the shot he aimed at Wilson was his second shot, but, as we have before observed, witnesses Merritt, Furze, and Queenth all testified positively and clearly that it was the second shot that caused Woodward and Clark to fall. Furthermore, when defendant left the place of shooting and, upon reaching the squad room, told witness Quiery that he had got two, defendant must have referred, not to Hoey and <em>Wilson,<\/em> as he now claims, but to Hoey and <em>Clark,<\/em> because, upon receiving the shot in his shoulder, Wilson instantly ran into the kitchen, so that defendant at that time could not have known positively that he had shot Wilson at all, much less that he had shot him fatally.<\/p> <p>The defendant admits that he began shooting with the intention of killing Hoey, but claims that he did not intend to injure Clark, his sentiments toward the latter being those of an older brother. It must be noted, however, that, if the witnesses Merritt, Furze, and Queenth are to be believed (as the testimony is analyzed above), the defendant aimed his second shot at Clark and Woodward as these two men were running toward the barber shop. Since he aimed at the two and yet, as he himself says, did not want to shoot Woodward, the man whom he did want to shoot must have been Clark. Moreover, Merritt testifies that simultaneously with the firing of the second shot the defendant called out to some one, \"Get away from in front of me; let me get that * * *.\" Since without intending to shoot Woodward he did so, Woodward must have been the man in front of him whom he wanted to get out of the way, leaving the man referred to by the epithet either Clark or Wilson. But as the bullet which passed through Woodward's hips did not strike Wilson, the inference is unavoidable that Woodward did not stand in the way of shooting Wilson but did stand in the way of shooting Clark, the man who fell simultaneously with Woodward. After the third shot was fired Merritt and Furze saw the defendant standing in the barber shop with his gun pointed downward. Since at that time Clark had a hole through his head made, according to Doctor Smith, by the discharge of a gun placed very close to his head, this situation also indicates that Clark was not only the man whom defendant wanted to get but the man whom he knew <em>he did get.<\/em> Finally, since, right after leaving the bodies of Hoey and Clark apparently lifeless, defendant boasted to Quiery that he had succeeded in getting two, and since he could not have known that he had shot Wilson because the latter fled to the kitchen where he informed Plesser that he was shot, the conclusion seems unavoidable that the two men over whose death defendant was glorying were Hoey and Clark. It thus appears clearly that the man whom defendant refers to as a brother is the man whom he, when engaged in his campaign of murder, was so anxious to \"get\" that he recklessly slew his friend Woodward.<\/p> <\/li><li>He assigns a fictitious provocation for the killing and a false time when he arrived at the determination to kill, thereby attempting to show that he committed said act in the heat of passion and therefore his conscience had no opportunity to overcome his will. We have already discussed this subject fully and come to the conclusion that the defendant gave a false cause as the origin of his murderous act and assigned a false time as to when he came to the definite resolution to kill.<\/li><\/ol><p><\/p> <p>From all the facts and circumstances of this case, we have no hesitancy in arriving at the conclusion that the crime of murder was accompanied with the aggravating circumstance of premeditation and that, therefore, the maximum penalty should have been imposed.<\/p> <p>We do not deem it necessary to consider those assignments of error of counsel for the defendant in which he raises the question of the right of the accused to be presented by a grand jury and to a trial by jury. That question has been determined adversely to the defendant by the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Dorr <em>vs<\/em>. United States (195 U. S., 138). As to those assignments of error in which counsel for the defendant asserts, in effect, that there are no courts in these Islands for the reason that they have not been legally constituted, we believe that we may justly say, if a court may properly discuss at all the question of its own existence, that this question also has been determined adversely to the defendant's contention by the Supreme Court of the United States. That court has taken cognizance of appeals from decisions of the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands, in which were passed upon judgments of the Courts of Firsts Instance, and has affirmed, reversed, or modified them as occasion required. This is, in effect, a holding on the part of the Supreme Court of the United States that the Courts of First Instance and the Supreme Court of these Islands have a legal existence and are legally constituted. Otherwise the Supreme Court of the United States would have had no authority or power to take cognizance of appeals from said court or to deal with any of the decisions thereof. If the courts here are not legally constituted and have no real existence, then their orders and decisions have no more force or effect than would the orders and decisions of one man or seven men, entirely irresponsible, gathered together on a street corner. It is no adequate reply to say that the question of the legal existence of the courts in these Islands was not raised in those cases before the Supreme Court of the United States. It does not need to be raised. It is not a question of jurisdiction but of existence. It is not a question of whether the act of this court is legal and within its jurisdiction or powers but whether there <em>is<\/em> a court. We are of the opinion that the Supreme Court of the United States by taking cognizance of the decisions of the courts of these Islands has necessarily declared their legal existence.<\/p> <p>Moreover, that the government here in these Islands, including, of course, the courts as an essential and integral accompaniment of government, has been legally and properly constituted by Congress, we do not doubt. That Congress had power to found and institute the government which is here established is not an open question. (Santiago <em>vs<\/em>. Nogueras, 214 U. S., 260; Downes <em>vs<\/em>. Bidwell, 182 U.

TISON, OPPONENT AND APPELLANT.<br\/>\n<br\/>\nD E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>CARSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">The ground of appellant's opposition to the adjudication and registry of the land in question in favor of the applicant therefor, under the provisions of the Land Registration Act, is her claim to an interest therein as one of the heirs of her deceased father, Domiciano Tison, who died in 1885, and in whose name a composition title to the land in question was issued on the 19th of March, 1883, by the <i>Direccion General\u00a0 de\u00a0 Administracion Civil\u00a0 de\u00a0 Filipinas,<\/i> which was duly registered in the old land registry.<br\/><br\/>Applicant for adjudication and registry does not deny the fact that the composition title was issued as\u00a0 alleged\u00a0 by the objector, nor does he\u00a0 question objector's right to\u00a0 an\u00a0 undivided interest by inheritance in any property owned by Domiciano Tison\u00a0 at the time of his death.<br\/><br\/>Applicant relies on\u00a0 the\u00a0 terms of a notarial instrument dated April 12, 1904, whereby Dolores Singian, the\u00a0 widow of Domiciano Tison (the father of the\u00a0 objector),\u00a0 sold to the\u00a0 applicant the land in question,\u00a0 reserving a right to repurchase on the terms and conditions set out in the deed; and\u00a0 contends\u00a0 that the\u00a0 land\u00a0 in question was the separate property (<i>bienes\u00a0 propios<\/i>)\u00a0 of Dolores Singian, his vendor, inherited from her father, and that her husband Domiciano Tison, although he procured the granting of the composition title thereto in his own name, never had any real right of ownership in or to the land.<br\/><br\/>The evidence of record\u00a0 discloses that Domiciano Tison owned no real estate whatever in\u00a0 the vicinity wherein the land in question is located prior to the time when he secured the issuance of the composition title in his own name; and in a formal instrument (Exhibit H)\u00a0 executed by him less than a year prior to the issuance of the composition title (June 26, 1882),\u00a0 before a local official in San Fernando de Pampanga, styling himself <i>juez mayor de sementeras,<\/i> and in the presence of various members of the <i>principalia,<\/i> or headmen, of the locality, he acknowledged and declared that certain lands located in that vicinity were\u00a0 the\u00a0 separate property (<i>bienes propios<\/i>) of his wife, Dolores.\u00a0 This\u00a0 evidence together with the evidence contained in various other private documents, including the <i>hijuela<\/i> (apportionment instrument) setting out the share of the estate of her father which was apportioned to Dolores Singian, tends strongly to sustain the finding of the trial court that the greater part of the land described\u00a0 in the composition title was the property of her ancestors\u00a0 and was inherited by her from them, and that the remainder of the land described in the composition title was purchased by or for her from funds which constituted a part of\u00a0 her separate estate (<i>bienes propios<\/i>).<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 only evidence tending to put these facts in doubt is the apparent discrepancy between the\u00a0 superficial extent of the land contained in the tract to which composition title was issued in the name of Domiciano Tison, and the amount of land which appears to have been apportioned to\u00a0 Dolores Singian from the estate-of her father, as shown by\u00a0 the <i>hijuela<\/i> (apportionment instrument) and by the other documents\u00a0 describing the land in that vicinity owned by her ancestors\u00a0 and claimed\u00a0 by her as\u00a0 her separate property (<i>bienes propios<\/i>).\u00a0\u00a0 These discrepancies, however, may be and must be accounted\u00a0 for and explained by the fact that ancient documents describing\u00a0 lands in these\u00a0 Islands\u00a0 by metes and boundaries frequently\u00a0 set\u00a0 out\u00a0 extremely inaccurate\u00a0 estimated areas\u00a0 of the lands\u00a0 thus described, the superficial extent never having been ascertained by a formal survey.<br\/><br\/>Upon the whole record, we are of opinion that the evidence sustains the\u00a0 finding\u00a0 by the\u00a0 trial court that the\u00a0 greater part of the land described in the composition title was the separate property\u00a0 (<i>bienes propios<\/i>.) of\u00a0 Dolores\u00a0 Singian\u00a0 acquired\u00a0 by her by inheritance from her father who\u00a0 died in 1879, and that the remainder was also her separate property (<i>bienes propios<\/i>) purchased by or for her with funds which constituted a part of\u00a0 her separate\u00a0 estate (<i>bienes propios)<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>It does not appear that the wife consented to the taking by her husband of the title to her separate property\u00a0 (<i>bienes propios<\/i>) in his own name or that he had any lawful authority so to do, and after his death she appears to have asserted her separate right thereto, notwithstanding the fact that it was registered in her husband's name, and to have exercised all the rights of ownership therein\u00a0 up to the time when she sold it to the applicant in these proceedings and put him in possession.\u00a0 Under these circumstances, we are of opinion that the husband had not and that his heirs have not such a right, title, or interest in or to the property in question\u00a0 as would\u00a0 sustain an opposition by\u00a0 them to the adjudication and registry of the\u00a0 land in question in favor of the applicant in these proceedings.\u00a0 At\u00a0 the time when the husband obtained the composition title to the land in his own name, he was\u00a0 the legal administrator of the conjugal property,\u00a0 and it is\u00a0 clear that\u00a0 in procuring the issuance of the composition\u00a0 title, in his own name,\u00a0 he must be\u00a0 held to have done so, first, merely as\u00a0 a step toward the placing of the title in her name by means of a later conveyance, which for some reason\u00a0 never was executed, or, second, by mistake either in\u00a0 the preparation\u00a0 of the formal documents or of his rights as legal administrator\u00a0 of the conjugal property, or, third, in fraud of his wife's rights thereto, for this purpose taking advantage of his\u00a0 position as administrator of the conjugal proierty.\u00a0 It is not necessary for us to determine the precise reason which induced him to act as he did, because it is quite clear that in any event, so\u00a0 long as the land\u00a0 remained\u00a0 in his name, his wife and\u00a0 her\u00a0 assigns had a perfect right to compel him during his lifetime, or his heirs after his\u00a0 death, to make\u00a0 the necessary conveyance placing the property in her name on the old land registry.<br\/><blockquote>\"The heirs of a\u00a0 deceased person can not be held to be 'third persons' (as\u00a0 that phrase is used in article 27 of the Mortgage Law)\u00a0 in relation to any contracts touching the real estate of their decedent which comes into their hands by right of inheritance; they take such property subject to all the obligations resting thereon in the hands of him from whom they derive their\u00a0 rights.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Mojica\u00a0 <i>vs. <\/i>Fernandez, 9 Phil. Rep., 403; decisions of the supreme\u00a0 court of Spain of January 27, 1881, and January 28, 1892.)<br\/><\/blockquote>The only question submitted on this appeal, resting as it does on the claim of appellant to an interest in the land in question,\u00a0 as heir of her father in whose name the composition title\u00a0 was issued, and it appearing\u00a0 that, as one of his heirs, she has no real interest or right of ownership therein and is under an obligation to join in a proper conveyance of the title to the\u00a0 land in question to\u00a0 Dolores Singian or her assignee,\u00a0 it is evident that the judge below properly rejected her opposition to the adjudication and\u00a0 registration of the land in favor x&gt;f the applicant, and\u00a0 held that she could not be heard\u00a0 to deny the right\u00a0 of ownership\u00a0 set up by him or to assert title in herself.<br\/><br\/>It is not necessary for us to decide\u00a0 and we do not decide what would\u00a0 have been the\u00a0 effect\u00a0 of a transfer on the old land registry by Domiciano\u00a0 Tison or his heirs of title to the land in question to a third person, a purchaser in good faith, because the\u00a0 record\u00a0 clearly\u00a0 discloses that\u00a0 no such transfer of title was in fact made.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of\u00a0 the court below adjudicating the land in question in favor of the applicant\u00a0 and directing its registry in his name should be affirmed with the costs of this instance against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i> Arellano,\u00a0 C.\u00a0 J., Torres,\u00a0 Mapa, Johnson, Moreland,<\/i>\u00a0 and <i>Elliott, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><\/div>",

That the three parcels of\u00a0 land\u00a0 above\u00a0 mentioned were,\u00a0 on the 3d day of\u00a0 August, 1899, sold by the said Ciriaco\u00a0 Montafies to Pedro Jaboneta,\u00a0 under a <i>pacto de retro<\/i>, for the sum of =P550.\u00a0 (Exhibit A.)<br\/><br\/>Fourth. That each of the above-mentioned contracts was a private document and none of them were recorded.<br\/><br\/>Fifth.\u00a0 That on the 3d day of August, 1906, the Court of First\u00a0 Instance of the Province of Occidental Negros, in an action then pending between Pedro Jaboneta, as plaintiff, and Ciriaco Montanez, as defendant, with reference to the three\u00a0 parcels of land in question, rendered a decision, the dispositive part of which was as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"In view of the allegations and the proofs adduced, this court deems it\u00a0 proper,\u00a0 as\u00a0 a matter\u00a0 of\u00a0 strict\u00a0 justice,\u00a0 to accede to the petition of the plaintiff,\u00a0 Pedro Jaboneta, and to declare consummated the\u00a0 sale, with <i>pacto de retro,<\/i> of the property specified in the contract set forth on folios 7 to 9 of the record, which property should be delivered to the plaintiff, together with the fruits, the rents, and the interest produced since the 16th of\u00a0 September, 1889, following tjie month in which\u00a0 the said contract was executed,\u00a0 with the costs of this instance.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Sixth. That under that sentence\u00a0 of the\u00a0 Court\u00a0 of First Instance (see par. 5 above) the defendant herein, Juan Garganera, as deputy sheriff of the Province of\u00a0 Occidental Negros, on the 2d of September, 1907,\u00a0 delivered the possession of the said parcels of land in question to the defendant, Pedro Jaboneta.<br\/><br\/>Seventh. That\u00a0 on the 5th of September, 1907, the plaintiff commenced the present action.<br\/><br\/>Eight. That at the time of the alleged mortgage and sale by Ciriaco Montanez to his brother, Higino Montanez, the former\u00a0 delivered to the latter the actual\u00a0 possession of the parcels of land in question.<br\/><br\/>Ninth. That in the said action in\u00a0 the Court of First Instance of the Province of Occidental Negros, between Pedro Jaboneta and\u00a0 Ciriaco\u00a0 Montanez, the\u00a0 plaintiff\u00a0 herein was not\u00a0 a party.\u00a0 The rights of Higino Montanez\u00a0 could not, therefore, have been affected in\u00a0 any way\u00a0 by that action\u00a0 or judgment.\u00a0 As to him\u00a0 that judgment was null and void. He was not given an opportunity to be heard.<br\/><br\/>Our conclusions from the foregoing\u00a0 facts are as follows:<br\/><br\/>First.\u00a0 That\u00a0 Higino\u00a0 Montanez having purchased of Ciriaco Montanez the parcels\u00a0 of land located in the <i>sitios<\/i>\u00a0 of Tabao\u00a0 and Nabusuang\u00a0 and having obtained possession\u00a0 of the same before the sale to Pedro\u00a0 Jaboneta, he\u00a0 (Higino Montanez) is\u00a0 the owner and entitled to\u00a0 its possession. (Art. 1473, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>Second. That\u00a0 Higino Montanez having legally\u00a0 acquired possession of the two parcels of\u00a0 land in the <i>sitios<\/i> of Tabao and Nabusuang under his alleged mortgage (Exhibit No. 1) before the sale to Pedro Jaboneta, he is entitled to the possession of said parcels of land until he\u00a0 is\u00a0 paid the full amount of his alleged mortgage.<br\/><br\/>Third.\u00a0 That Higino Montanez not having\u00a0 been a party to the action between Pedro Jaboneta and Ciriaco Montanez, his right in the parcels of land was not affected thereby, and consequently his\u00a0 dispossession\u00a0 under that judgment\u00a0 was illegal.\u00a0 He is, therefore, entitled to be restored to the possession of the two parcels of land located in the\u00a0 sitios of Tabao and Nabusuang, until his so-called mortgage is paid.<br\/><br\/>Therefore that\u00a0 part of the judgment of the lower court which allowed Pedro Jaboneta to retain the\u00a0 possession of the parcels of land in the <i>sitios<\/i> of Tabao and Nabusuang is hereby reversed and it is hereby ordered and decreed that the possession of those parcels of land be returned to Higino Montanez and that he be protected in the possession of the same until the full amount of his alleged mortgage is paid. Without any finding as to damages for the illegal possession or as to costs, it is so ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J.,\u00a0 Torres, Moreland, <\/i>and <i>Trent, JJ., <\/i>concur.<\/div>",

eleven plow carabaos, three carabao cows with four calves, and four head of cattle, acquired by the community; a mortgage credit of\u00a0 130 pesos against Laureano Soliano. secured by a mortgage on his land in the barrio of Bagacay of the pueblo of Bogo, and three carabaos.<br\/><br\/>That the business of\u00a0 the said four brothers and sisters was, by\u00a0 common\u00a0 accord, administered by\u00a0 one\u00a0 of them, Espiridion Barte, and, when he died,\u00a0 the three\u00a0 survivors remained united in their interests and\u00a0 the undivided property was\u00a0 administered,\u00a0 until\u00a0 December,\u00a0 1901, by\u00a0 Pedro Barte, who at his death\u00a0 left four heirs, the said Maximina, Paulina, Pelagia, and Maxima, represented by their mother, Luisa Ravilan, the wife and widow of Pedro Barte\u00a0 and the\u00a0 defendant in\u00a0 this\u00a0 suit; that\u00a0 the said\u00a0 property, as aforestated,\u00a0 was\u00a0 administered by\u00a0 Espiridion\u00a0 Barte, in common accord with the others, and, he having died without leaving heirs, by\u00a0 force\u00a0 of law the\u00a0 part that pertained to him passed to his brother Pedro and his sisters Jorgia\u00a0 and Matea, as the heirs nearest\u00a0 of kin of the said Espiridion, and,\u00a0 by\u00a0 common agreement, the said\u00a0 brother and sisters continued their partnership organization and appointed the brother Pedro as administrator;\u00a0 that\u00a0 during the latter's administration, Matea Barte also died,\u00a0 leaving as her heir Nicolas Mendoza, represented by his father Donato, one of the\u00a0 plaintiffs; that at the death\u00a0 of Pedro\u00a0 Barte,\u00a0 Jorgia Barte and Donato Mendoza, in the name of their son Nicolas, decided upon the distribution\u00a0 of the property mentioned and so stated, in February, 1902, to Luisa Ravilan, thie'guardian of the heirs\u00a0 of Pedro Barte, but that\u00a0 Ravilan would\u00a0 not agree to\u00a0 the partition, on the pretext that was the administratrix of that property, she had to pay\u00a0 debts of\u00a0 the deceased.<br\/><br\/>That three years having elapsed, up to\u00a0 the time of\u00a0 the complaint, and the debts having been settled, as\u00a0 admitted by the defendant herself, the latter was requested to present the accounts, which she\u00a0 absolutely refused to do,\u00a0 and that she continued in the possession\u00a0 and to\u00a0 enjoy the usufruct of the said property, without\u00a0 the consent or intervention of the\u00a0 plaintiffs; that Jorgia\u00a0 Barte,\u00a0 Nicolas\u00a0 Mendoza,\u00a0 the heir of Matea Barte, and the heirs of Pedro Barte, named Maximina, Paulina, Pelagia, and Maxima Barte, were then entitled to the property in question, which should be divided among them in three equal parts, one to be allotted to Jorgia Barte, another to Nicolas Mendoza,\u00a0 and the other to\u00a0 the heirs of Pedro Barte.<br\/><br\/>The demand further recites that the plaintiffs desire that a\u00a0 division be made and therefore pray that\u00a0 a partition of the property,\u00a0 both real and personal, be decreed and also of the profits that may have accrued thereto during\u00a0 the time that it was in the possession of and usufruct enjoyed by the defendant,\u00a0 in accordance with the respective rights of the parties, and that, in case that the distribution can not be made without detriment to such rights, the property be ordered sold and the proceeds divided among the parties. The plaintiffs requested\u00a0 also that the costs of the suit be assessed against the defendant.<br\/><br\/>A demurrer to\u00a0 the\u00a0 complaint was interposed, although the record\u00a0 does not show\u00a0 how it was\u00a0 decided.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 defendants in their\u00a0 answer denied all the allegations of the amended complaint.<br\/><br\/>The case\u00a0 came\u00a0 to trial and, the testimony having been adduced by\u00a0 both parties, the exhibits being attached to the record, the judge,\u00a0 in view of the conclusions reached therefrom and on the date of November 4, 1907, rendered judgment in favor of\u00a0 the plaintiffs, by ordering the partition of the property mentioned, in the manner and portions expressed in the judgment,\u00a0 and decreeing that such partition must be made in accordance with sections 185 to 195 of the Code of Civil Procedure, with respect to the real property,\u00a0 and that the five\u00a0 carabaos\u00a0 should be distributed in three equal allotments in\u00a0 the\u00a0 manner\u00a0 determined for the real property.\u00a0 The costs were charged to the plaintiffs and assessed against' the divisible property.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the\u00a0 defendant excepted to this judgment and prayed for its annulment and a new trial.\u00a0 The motion was overruled, to which exception was taken, and the appellant duly presented his bill\u00a0 of exceptions, which was approved and forwarded to this court.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<br\/><br\/>A demand is made in the complaint for the partition of the common property\u00a0 held\u00a0 undividedly by four\u00a0 brothers and sisters who formed\u00a0 a partnership for the use and enjoyment of the same.<br\/><br\/>In\u00a0 relating the\u00a0 origin of a part of the\u00a0 property of the four brothers and sisters joined in partnership, the plaintiffs stated that their deceased parents, Javier Barte and Eulalia Seno,\u00a0 left at their death nine children, above mentioned, and property consisting of carabaos,\u00a0 a credit, and\u00a0 lands situated in the pueblo of Mandaue, and that, their property having been divided among their nine children, that portion thereof which corresponded\u00a0 to the brothers and sisters Espiridion, Jorgia, Matea, and Pedro\u00a0 remained undivided and its owners, associated together, continued to enjoy it and manage it in common,\u00a0 separately from their\u00a0 other brothers and sisters.<br\/><br\/>Although it be decided that it was not necessary to prove that the said nine brothers and sisters were unquestionably the children of the deceased Javier Barte and Eulalia, and are therefore\u00a0 their only heirs, it should at least have been shown that a lawful partition was made among their nine children, of the property left by both\u00a0 spouses at their death, and that the\u00a0 three\u00a0 parcels of land situated in\u00a0 the pueblo of Mandaue,\u00a0 and said to be possessed by\u00a0 the\u00a0 said four brothers and sisters associated together, were awarded to the same.\u00a0 Such a partition, were it made, should appear in an\u00a0 authentic document,\u00a0 which was\u00a0 not exhibited with the complaint, since article 1068 of the Civil Code provides \"A division legally made confers upon\u00a0 each heir the exclusive ownership\u00a0 of the\u00a0 property\u00a0 which\u00a0 may have\u00a0 been awarded to him.\"<br\/><br\/>Even though titles of ownership of the\u00a0 said property were not exhibited, if it had been shown that the Mandaue lands\u00a0 had been awarded by partition to the four brothers and sisters aforementioned, there would have been prima facie proof that they were and\u00a0 certainly\u00a0 are the owners thereof.<br\/><br\/>Section\u00a0 181\u00a0 of the\u00a0 Code of Civil Procedure reads:\u00a0 \"A person having or holding real estate with others, in any form of joint tenancy or tenancy in common, may compel partition thereof in the manner hereinafter prescribed.\"<br\/><br\/>Section 183 of the same code also prescribes: \"The complaint in an action for partition\u00a0 shall set forth the nature. end extent of the plaintiff's title and contain an adequate description of the real estate of which partition\u00a0 is\u00a0 demanded, and name each tenant in common, coparcener, or other person interested therein, as defendants.\"<br\/><br\/>So that\u00a0 he\u00a0 who demands or claims a partition of the property must have the status of; a coproprietor or coowner of the property the partition\u00a0 of which is asked for; and notwithstanding the fact that Jorgia Barte and the son of Matea Barte, through his representative, aver that they are the coowners of the said Mandaue lands and of others situated in\u00a0 the\u00a0 municipalities of\u00a0 Bogo\u00a0 and Tabogon, they have not proved their\u00a0 averment by titles\u00a0 which establish the common ownership alleged.\u00a0 A mere affirmation without proofs is insufficient, since the defendant party, represent ng the four daughters of the deceased Pedro Barte, absolutely denied all the allegations of the complaint.<br\/><br\/>It is true that the defendant Luisa Ravilan stated in her sworn testimony that, as the guardian of her\u00a0 children, she had an\u00a0 interest in the lands situated in Mandaue and that the parcels of land situated in Tabogon did not belong to her, nor to her deceased husband,\u00a0 Pedro Barte; but she positively affirmed that\u00a0 the seven parcels of land situated in\u00a0 Bogo were acquired by her said husband during\u00a0 his lifetime and during his marriage with her, and\u00a0 she exhibited five documents, one of them\u00a0 the original\u00a0 of\u00a0 a possessory information, as titles\u00a0 proving the ownership\u00a0 of\u00a0 her said husband.<br\/><br\/>Against the averment of the\u00a0 plaintiffs\u00a0 appears that of the defendant, in the name of her four daughters, the heirs of Pedro Barte, and while the plaintiff party exhibited no title of ownership whatever, not even of the lands situated in the pueblo of Bogo and which the defendant\u00a0 affirmed were acquired by her deceased husband, Pedro Barte, during his lifetime,\u00a0 it\u00a0 is\u00a0 an\u00a0 indisputable fact\u00a0 that\u00a0 the latter's widow, who in her own behalf and in the name of her four daughters claims the exclusive\u00a0 ownership of the lands in Bogo, is\u00a0 at the present\u00a0 time in possession thereof, and moreover\u00a0 showed documents which prove\u00a0 the\u00a0 acquisition of some of them.\u00a0 The testimony of the\u00a0 defendant to the effect\u00a0 that she only had a share in the lands of Mandaue, but not in those situated\u00a0 in Tabogon,\u00a0 is worthy of serious consideration, although she positively affmned\u00a0 that those situated in Bogo belonged to her husbatfd and\u00a0 to herself. As she is\u00a0 in possession of these lands and as\u00a0 the record of the trial shows no proof that they belonged to the joint association\u00a0 or partnership existing between the said four brothers and sisters, there are no legal provisions that would support the\u00a0 issuance of an order\u00a0 for the partition of the said lands in Bogo, of which the widow of their alleged former owner is now in\u00a0 possession.<br\/><br\/>In actions for the partition of property held in common it is assumed that\u00a0 the parties are all coowners\u00a0 or coproprietors of the undivided\u00a0 property to be partitioned.\u00a0 The question of common ownership\u00a0 need not be gone into at the time of the trial, but only how, in what manner, and in what proportion the said property of common\u00a0 ownership , shall be distributed among the interested\u00a0 parties by\u00a0 order of court.<br\/><br\/>Moreover, for the purposes of the partition demanded, it must be remembered that the hereditary succession of the deceased Espiridion Barte, who it is said left no\u00a0 legitimate descendants at his\u00a0 death, should be divided among his eight brothers and sisters who may have survived him, and\u00a0 in case any of these have\u00a0 died, the children of his deceased brother or sister, that is, his\u00a0 nephews and nieces. per stirpes, are entitled to share in his inheritance, according to the provisions of articles 946, 947, and 948 of the Civil Code,\u00a0 the last cited of\u00a0 which\u00a0 prescribes: \"Should brothers survive with nephews, children of brothers of the whole blood,\u00a0 the former\u00a0 shall\u00a0 inherit per capita and the latter <i>per stirpes,<\/i>\" representing their respective fathers or mothers, brothers or sisters of the deceased.<br\/><br\/>The record does not show whether Jorgia Barte left any legitimate heir at her death, and if she did not, her collateral relatives succeed her\u00a0 in the manner provided by law.<br\/><br\/>It\u00a0 is to be noted\u00a0 that the\u00a0 partnership contract entered into\u00a0 by the four brothers and\u00a0 sisters\u00a0 can not affect the hereditary rights which belong\u00a0 to the relatives of the deceased predecessor in interest nor alter the order prescribed by law for testate or intestate successions.\u00a0 (Arts. 744, 763, 806, 808, 913, 946, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, it is proper, in our opinion, with\u00a0 a reversal of the judgment appealed from, to declare, and we do hereby declare,\u00a0 that\u00a0 the partition\u00a0 prayed for be denied, and\u00a0 to absolve, as we\u00a0 do hereby absolve, the defendant Luisa Ravilan from the complaint, without special finding as to costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Rep.', 1) ; but apart <em>from the concurrence <\/em>of the courts below, the proper proceeding in a case of this kind is by writ of error, and therefore the appeal is dismissed (Carino <em>vs.<\/em> Insular Government, 212 U. S., 449; 53 L. ed., 594; 29 Sup. Ct. Rep., 334). So much being established, the grounds on which the plantiff in error can claim title may be stated in a few words. On July 13, 1873, the <em>gobernadorcillo <\/em>and <em>principales<\/em> of the town of Mabalacat, in the Province of Pampanga, Luzon, executed an instrument, marked 0. K. by the parish priest, purporting to grant the land, with qualifications not needing to be noticed, to one Rafael Lacson, under whom the plaintiff in error claims. Possession was held until 1885, and since then has been abandoned. The land was public land. The question brought here were whether the original grant was valid, or, if not, whether the possession that followed it without interruption for ten years and more conferred title by prescription under the royal decree of June 25, 1880. This decree states the rule of prescription in the usual terms of the civil law. It confers ownership on those who shall establish that they have possessed the lands in question for the requisite time under just title and in good faith. (See Civil Code, arts. 1957, 1952, 1953.)<p><\/p><p>As we understand the later briefs filed in behalf of the plaintiff in error, the vain attempt to justify the grant under the <em>Recopilacion de Leyes de las Indias<\/em>, Book 4, title 12, law 1, is given up, and therefore we shall spend no time upon that. There is, however, an effort to support it under a decree of January 4, 1813 (1 Reynolds, Spanish and Mexican Land Laws, 83.) This was a scheme of the <em>Cortes <\/em>to reduce public and crown lands to private ownership, after reserving one half for the public debt. When certain preliminaries had been accomplished as to which we have no information, the other half was to be allotted in the first place to retired officers and soldiers who had served in the present war, etc., as a patriotic reward. Of the remaining land, there was to be given, gratuitously and by lot, to every resident of the respective towns who applied, a tract, under certain limitations. The proceedings on these grants were to be had by the constitutional common councils, and the provincial deputations were to approve them. Although this decree purported to apply to crown lands \"in the provinces beyond the sea\" as well as to those in the <em>Peninsula<\/em>, it would seem, on the face of it, to have been intended for Spaniards, and to have had but doubtful reference to the natives of conquered territory.<\/p><p>But there are other answers to the suggestion that are free from doubt. The decree has been said to have been repealed in the following year. (United States <em>vs.<\/em> Clarke, 8 Pet., 436, 455; 8 L. ed., 1001, 1008; Hall, Mexican Law, 48.) But compare United States <em>vs.<\/em> Vallejo (1 Black, 541; 17 L. ed., 232), Hayes <em>vs.<\/em> United States (170 U. S., 637, 653, 654; 42 L. ed., 1174, 1180, 1181; 18 Sup. Ct. Rep., 735.) But even if it be assumed, as it is by the argument for the plaintiff in error, that either that or later legislation to similar effect instituted a working system in the Philippines \u2014a large assumption\u2014it is admitted that the conditions of the supposed gratuity were not fulfilled. Our attention has not been called to any law giving authority to the ill-defined body that attempted to make the grant. The land was not distributed by lot, and the essential requirement of approval by a higher authority was wholly neglected. In view of the admission to which we have referred, we find it unnecessary to follow the learned and able argument of the Solicitor-General. There is a hint, to be sure, that the grant may be presumed to have satisfied native custom, and may be sustained upon that ground. But such a notion would be a mongrel offspring of Spanish law and ignorance, and no reason is given for making the presumption other than a guess. Unauthorized grants of public lands by subordinate officials seem to have been a noticeable feature in other<\/p><p>Spanish colonies. (Whitney <em>vs.<\/em> United States, 181 U. S. 104, 114, 115; 45 L. ed., 771, 775, 776; 21 Sup. Ct. Rep!] 565.) The real object of the reference to the decree of 1813 is to found a claim of prescription by showing a just title for the possession which is proved to have been maintained for ten years. Lacson, the original grantee, held the land until 1881, when he conveyed it to Pedro Carrillo and his wife. Posses sion was abandoned in 1885 without further change of title. Therefore the only \"just title\" to which the possession can be referred is the original grant. The phrase justo titvlo is explained to mean a title such as to transfer the property (Schmidt, Civil Law of Spain and Mexico, 289, 290; see Partidas, law 18, tit. 29, p. 3) ; or, as it is denned in the Civil Code of a few years later than the decree of 1880, \"that which legally suffices to transfer the ownership or property right, the prescription of which is in question.\" (Section 1952.) Of course, this does not mean that the <em>titulo<\/em> must have been effective in the particular case, for then prescription would be. unnecessary. We assume for instance that if a private person in possession of Crown lands, seeming to be the owner, executed a formally valid conveyance under which his grantee held, supposing his title good, possession for ten years might create an indisputable right. But if the public facts known by the grantees showed that the conveyance to him was void, we understand that it would not constitute a starting point for the running of time, and that the grantee's actual belief would not help his case. Indeed, in such a case he would not be regarded as holding in good faith, within the requirement of the decree, because a man is not allowed to take advantage of his ignorance of law. The subject is fully expounded in Hayes <em>vs.<\/em> United States (170 U. S., 637, 650, et aeq.; 42 L. ed., 1174, 1179; 18 Sup. Ct. Rep., 735).<\/p><p>All that was done to give Lacson a lawful title was insufficient on its face. Therefore, on the facts known to him he was chargeable with knowledge that he had acquired no legal rights, and it was impossible that the period of scription should begin to run from the date of the instrument under which he claimed. The possession of Carrillo and his successors, after the conveyance to him in 1881, was not maintained for ten years, and therefore the claim of the plaintiff in error must fail.<\/p><p><em>Judgment affirmed<\/em>.<\/p><br\/><br\/><br\/><hr align=\"LEFT\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> 215 U.

Villanueva gave the bond, the subject of this suit, he was already permanently insane, was in that state when summoned and still continued so, for which reason he neither appeared nor defended himself in the said litigation; and, in conclusion, she petitioned the court to relieve the said defendant Villanueva from compliance with the aforestated judgment rendered against him in the suit before mentioned, arid to reopen the trial for the introduction of evidence in behalf of the said defendant with respect to his incapacity at the time of the execution of the bond in question, which evidence could not be presented in due season on account of the then existing incapacity of the defendant.<br\/><br\/>The court granted the petition and the trial was reopened for the introduction of evidence, after due consideration of which, when taken, the court decided that when Vicente Villanueva, on the 15th of December, 1908, executed the bond in question, he understood perfectly well the nature and consequences of the act performed by him and that the consent that was given by him for the purpose was entirely voluntary and, consequently, valid and efficacious. As a result of such findings the court ruled that the petition for an indefinite stay of execution of the judgment rendered in the case be denied and that the said execution be carried out.<br\/><br\/>After the filing of an exception to the above ruling, a new hearing was requested \"with reference to the defendant Vicente S. Villanueva\" and, upon its denial, a bill of exceptions was presented in support of the appeal submitted to this court and which is based on a single assignment of error as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Because the lower court found that the monomania of great wealth, suffered by the defendant Villanueva, does not imply incapacity to execute a bond such as the one herein concerned.\"<\/blockquote>Certainly the trial court founded its judgment on the basis of the medico-legal doctrine which supports the conclusion that such monomania of wealth does not necessarily imply the result that the defendant Villanueva was not a person capable of executing a contract of bond like the one here in question.<br\/><br\/>This court has not found the proof of the error attributed to the judgment of the lower court. It would have been necessary fo show that such monomania was habitual And constituted a veritable mental perturbation in the patient; that the bond executed by the defendant Villanueva was the result of such monomania, and not the effect of any other cause, that is, that there was riot, nor could there have been any other cause for the contract than an ostentation of wealth and this purely an effect of such monomania of wealth; and that the monomania existed on the date when the bond in question was executed.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the first point: \"All alienists and those, writers who have treated of this branch of medical science distinguish numerous degrees of insanity and imbecility, some of them, as Gasper, going so far into a wealth of classification and details as to admit the existence of 60 to 80 distinct statesman enumeration of which is unnecessary. Hence, the confusion and the doubt in the minds of the majority of the authors of treatises on the subject in determining the limits of sane judgment and the point of beginning of this incapacity, there being some who consider as a sufficient cause for such incapacity, not only insanity and imbecility, but even those other chronic diseases or complaints that momentarily perturb or cloud the intelligence, as mere monomania, somnambulism, epilepsy, drunkenness, suggestion, anger, and the divers passional states which more or less violently deprave the human will of necessary liberty.\" (Manresa, Commentaries on the Civil Code, Vol. V, p, 342.) In our present knowledge of the state of mental alienation such certainty has not yet been reached as to warrant the conclusion, in a judicial decision, that he who suffers the monomania of wealth, believing himself to be very wealthy when he is not, is really insane and it is to be presumed, in the absence of a judicial declaration, that he acts under the influence of a perturbed mind, or that his mind is deranged when be executes an onerous contract. The bond, as aforesaid, was executed by Vicente S. Villanueva on December 15,1908, and his incapacity, for the purpose of providing a guardian for him, was not declared until July 24, 1909.<br\/><br\/>The trial court, although it conceded as a fact that the defendant,had for several years suffered from such monomania, decided,;however,,guided by the medico-legal doctrine above cited, that a person's believing himself to be what he is not or his taking a mere illusion for a reality is not necessarily a positive proof of insanity or incapacity to bind himself in a contract. Specifically, in reference to this case, the following facts were brought out in the testimony given by the physicians, Don Rudesino Cuervo and Don Gervasio de Ocampo, witnesses for the defendant, the first of whom had visited him some eight times during the years 1902 and 1903, and the latter, only once, in 1908.<br\/><blockquote>Dr. Cuervo:<br\/><br\/>\"Q. But if you should present to him a document which in no wise concerns his houses and if you should direct him to read it, do you believe that he would understand the contents of the document? - A. As to understanding it, it is possible that he might, in this I see nothing particularly remarkable; but afterwards, to decide upon the question involved, it might be that he could not do that; it depends upon what the question was.\"<br\/><br\/>Dr. Ocampo:<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Do you say that he is intelligent with respect to things other than those concerning greatness? - A. Yes, he reasons in matters which do not refer to the question of greatness and wealth.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. He can take a written paper and read it and understand it, can he not? - A. Read it, yes, he can read it and understand it, it is probable that he can, I have made no trial.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Is he not a man of considerable intelligence only with the exception of this monomania of greatness and wealth? -\u00a0 A. Of not much intelligence, an ordinary intelligence.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. He knows how to read and write, does he not ? - A. Yes, sir, I believe that he does.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Mr. F. B. Ingersoll, a witness for the plaintiff, testified that as a notary he had prepared the instrument of bond and received the statements of the signers; that he explained to Mr. Villanueva its contents and when the witness asked the latter whether he wished to sign it he replied that he was willing and did in fact do so; that the defendant's mental condition appeared to the witness to be normal and regular and that he observed nothing to indicate the contrary; and that the defendant was quiet and composed and spoke in an ordinary way without giving cause for any suspicion that there was anything abnormal.<br\/><br\/>Honorable Judge Araullo testified as a witness for the plaintiff that while trying in the Court of First Instance, over which he presided, the case concerning the estate of the Chinaman Go-Cho-Co, and Mr. Villanueva haying been proposed as a surety therein, the witness asked him some questions about his property, in order to ascertain whether he was solvent and would be adequate surety, and that Villanueva testified the same as many .others had done, and witness did not notice any particular disorder or perturbation of his mental faculties; that he answered the questions concerning the property that he held, stated its value, specified the place where it was situated, his answers being precisely relevant to the matter treated; that he therefore approved the bond; and that all this took place between July and September, 1908. This witness having been asked, on cross-examination, whether Mr. Villanueva, subsequent to the date mentioned, had again been surety in any other case, and whether it appeared strange to witness that Mr. Villanueva should engage in giving bonds and whether for that reason he rejected this new bond, replied that it was in that same case relative to the estate of the Chinaman. Go-Cho-Co that he endeavored to investigate, as he customarily did, with regard to whether Mr. Villanueva had given any other previous bond, and that he discovered that he had in fact previously given bond in a criminal case, but that, as it had already been cancelled, he had no objection to accepting the one.offered by Mr. Villanueva in the said Go-Cho-Co case.<br\/><br\/>Capacity to act must be supposed to attach to a person who has not previously been declared incapable, and such capacity is presumed to continue so long as the contrary be not proved, that is, that at the moment of his acting he was incapable, crazy, insane, or out of his mind: which, in the opinion of this court, has not been proved in this case.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the second point, it is very obvious that in every contract there must be a consideration to substantiate the obligation, so much so that, even though it should not be expressed in the contract, it is presumed that it exists and that it is lawful, unless the debtor proves the contrary. (Civil Code, art. 1277.) In the contract of bond the consideration, generally, is no other, as in all contracts of pure beneficence, than the liberality of the benefactor. (Id, 1274.) Out of the ordinary, a bond may be given for some other consideration, according to the agreement and the free stipulation of the parties and may be, as in onerous and remuneratory contracts, something remunerative stipulated as an equivalent, on the part of the beneficiary of the bond.<br\/><br\/>It is not clear as to the reason why Villanueva gave the bond in favor of the two members of the firm of Arenas &amp; Co., Francisco Lara, and Juan Arenas. Lara testified that he had never had dealings with Villanueva; from which it is inferred that the latter could hardly have been moved to favor the former by the benefit of an assumed obligation to pay him some three thousand pesos, with monthly interest. But he added that Arenas &amp; Co. obtained an agent to look for sureties for them, to whom Arenas paid a certain sum of money. The witness did not know, however, whether Arenas gave the money for the signature of the bond or simply in order that the agent might find sureties. The fact is that the sureties came with the agent and signed the bond.<br\/><br\/>The appellant presented, as proof that Villanueva concealed from his family his dealings with Arenas, a note by the latter addressed to his friend, Mr. Villanueva, on the 13th of May, 1909, that is, two days before Villanueva was declared to be in default, inviting him to a conference \"for the purpose of treating of a matter of great importance of <i>much interest<\/i> to Villanueva, between 5 and 6 of that same day, in the garden and on the benches which are in front of the Delmonico Hotel, on Calle Palacio, corner of Calle Victoria, and, if it rained, in the bar on the corner.\" It can not be affirmed with certainty, (the trial court considers it probable) that Villanueva engaged in the business of giving bonds for a certain consideration or remuneration; but neither can it be sustained that, there was no other cause for the giving of the bond in question than the mental disorder that dominated the intellect of the person obligated, to the extent of his believing'himself so oversupplied with money as to be able to risk it in behalf of any person whatever. There is no proof that the said bond was merely the product of an insensate ostentation of wealth, nor that, if Villanueva boasted of wealth in giving several bonds, among them that herein concerned, he was influenced only by the monomania of boasting of being wealthy, when he was not.<br\/><br\/>Neither is there any proof whatever with respect to the third point, that is, that, granting that he was a monomaniac, he was dominated by that malady when he executed the bond now under discussion. In the interpretative jurisprudence on this kind of incapacity, to wit, lunacy or insanity, it is a rule of constant application that it is not enough that there be more or less probability that a person was in a state of dementia at a given time, if there is not direct proof that, at the date of the performance of the act which it is endeavored to invalidate for want of capacity on the part of the executor, the latter was insane or demented,in other words, that he could not, in the performance of that act, give his conscious, free, voluntary, deliberate and intentional consent. The witnesses who as physicians testified as to extravagancies observed in Villanueva's conduct, referred, two of them, to a time prior to 1903, and another of them to the year 1908, but none to December 15, 1908, the date of the execution of the bond sought to be invalidated. The testimony of one of these witnesses shows that when Villanueva's wife endeavored, in 1908, to have her husband confined in the Hospicio de San Jose and cared for therein, objection was made by the director of the institution who advised her that if he entered in that way and lodged in the ward for old men, as soon as he shouted and disturbed them in their sleep he would have to be locked up in the insane ward; to which Villanueva's wife replied \"that her husband was not exactly insane enough to be placed among the insane.\" This same lady, testifying as a witness in this case, stated: that no restrictions had ever been placed upon her husband's liberty to go wherever he wished and do what he liked; that her husband had property of his own and was not deprived of its management; that he went out every morning without her knowing where he went; that she did not know whether he had engaged in the business of signing bonds, and that, with reference to the one now concerned, she had learned of it only by finding the note, before mentioned, wherein Arenas invited him to a rendezvous on the benches in front of the Delmonico Hotel; that she had not endeavored legally to deprive him of the management of his own real estate.which had been inherited by him, although he did not attend toihe collection of the rents and the payment of the land tax, all this being done by her, and she also it was who attended to the subsistence of the family and to all their needs. Finally, and with direct reference to the point under discussion, she, was asked:<br\/><blockquote>\"Q. Is it not true that, up to the date of his signing this bond, he used to go out of the house and was on the streets nearly every day? to which she replied: - A. He went where he pleased, he does this even now. He goes to the markets, and buys provisions and other things. In fact I don't know where he does go.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Prom his actions toward others, did he show any indication of not being sane when he was on the street, according to your opinion? - A. Half of Manila knows him and are informed of this fact and it is very strange that this should have occurred. If you need witnesses to prove it, there are many people who can testify in regard to this particular.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The only incorrectness mentioned by this lady is that her husband, when he went to the market, would return to the house with his pockets full of tomatoes and onions, and when she was asked by the judge whether he was a man of frugal habits, she replied that, as far as she knew, he had never squandered any large sum of money; that he had never been engaged in business; that he supported himself on what she gave him; and that if he had something to count on for his living, it was the product of his lands.<br\/><br\/>Such is a summary of the facts relating to the debated incapacity of the appellant, and it is very evident that it can not be concluded therefrom that, on December 15,1908, when Villanueva subscribed the obligation how contested, he did not possess the necessary capacity to give efficient consent with respect to the bond which he freely executed. Therefore, the judgment appealed from is affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant. So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Johnson, Carson,<\/i> and <i>Moreland, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><\/div>",

He may be\u00a0 civilly liable for a\u00a0 breach of his contract, but\u00a0 there were no\u00a0 misrepresentations\u00a0 made by the defendant, so far as the\u00a0 evidence shows,\u00a0 sufficient to justify his conviction for\u00a0 the crime of <em>estafa.<\/em>\u00a0 The sentence of the lower court\u00a0 is, therefore, hereby reversed, and it is hereby ordered that the complaint be dismissed against the defendant and that he be discharged from the custody of the law.<\/p><p><em>Torres, Mapa, Carson<\/em>, and <em>Moreland, JJ<\/em>., concur.<\/p><\/div>",

But this alleged written partition\u00a0 agreement, was not produced at the trial, and the failure to produce it, in view of the other evidence of record, leaves no room for doubt that no written agreement signed by all the heirs to the estate was ever executed; and we agree with the trial judge that whatever tentative agreement in\u00a0 regard to the partition of the estate may have been entered into by some of the heirs, the plaintiff in this action, Eusebia Broce,\u00a0 was\u00a0 not a party thereto.<\/p><p>Article 1067 of the Civil Code provides\u00a0 that:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>If any of the heirs should sell his hereditary rights to a stranger before the division, all or any of the coheirs may\u00a0 subrogate themselves\u00a0 in the\u00a0 place\u00a0 of\u00a0 a purchaser, reimbursing him\u00a0 for\u00a0 the value of the purchase,\u00a0 provided they\u00a0 do so within the period of a month, to be counted from the time they were informed thereof.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Plaintiff's claim of\u00a0 a right to be subrogated in place of the defendant as the purchaser of the interests of some of her coheirs in the intestate estate of her grandmother is based upon\u00a0 this\u00a0 article,\u00a0 and\u00a0 the real\u00a0 contention of\u00a0 the defendant\u00a0 in this court is that she failed to exercise\u00a0 her rights of subrogation\u00a0 within the\u00a0 period of a month from the time when she was informed of the sale of the interests of\u00a0 her coheirs to\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant; indeed, defendants\u00a0 claim that these sales were made with the knowledge and consent of the plaintiffs.\u00a0\u00a0 There is nothing in\u00a0 the record, however, which sustains or even tends\u00a0 to\u00a0 sustain defendants' contention.\u00a0 The sales were made on\u00a0 the\u00a0 24th day of November, 1909, and an\u00a0 attempt was made to prove that Silverio Vicente, the co-plaintiff and husband of the plaintiff Eusebia Broce, had knowledge of the sales before\u00a0 the end of that month or early in\u00a0 the\u00a0 month of December.\u00a0 This is denied by\u00a0 the husband and we think it is quite clearly established that if he knew anything whatever in\u00a0 regard to the transaction, his information was based wholly on current rumor, and was so indefinite and uncertain that it could not have imposed upon him any obligation\u00a0 to exercise or to decline to exercise a right of\u00a0 subrogation under the provisions of the above\u00a0 cited article of\u00a0 the Civil\u00a0 Code,\u00a0 even had\u00a0 he himself been the\u00a0 directly interested party.\u00a0 There is\u00a0 no proof whatever in the\u00a0 record as to the time when Eusebia Broce, herself, had notice of the sales of the shares of her coheirs to the defendant De la Vina, other than her own testimony that she learned that these sales\u00a0 had been made, some time about the middle of the month of January, 1910. Her husband admits that during\u00a0 the month of December, 1909,\u00a0 he heard rumors as to the sales, and\u00a0 alleges\u00a0 that immediately thereafter he made diligent effort to ascertain the truth of these\u00a0 rumors.\u00a0 He employed an attorney and with his assistance made inquiry at the office of the registrar\u00a0 of property\u00a0 of Occidental Negros,\u00a0 but found no documentary\u00a0 evidence or other record\u00a0 in\u00a0 regard to the transaction.\u00a0\u00a0 He called on the notary who was said to have written the document, but could not at that time secure any accurate\u00a0 information as to the contents of the\u00a0 deeds of sale, because the notary's books had been forwarded to the clerk of the court at Bacolod for some purpose. Later, on or about the 14th day of January, 1910, plaintiff's attorney for\u00a0 the first time learned the date and time of the sales, and the parties\u00a0 thereto, from a record found in the office of the clerk of the court at Bacolod, and immediately notified the plaintiffs\u00a0 of the facts thus discovered.\u00a0\u00a0 This action was commenced twelve days later, on the 26th day of January, 1910, by the filing of\u00a0 the complaint in the\u00a0 Court of First Instance of Occidental Negros.\u00a0 In our opinion the record clearly discloses that the plaintiff Eusebia Broce, when she received the first\u00a0 authentic information as to the terms and conditions\u00a0 of the sale of\u00a0 the property of her coheirs to the defendant De\u00a0 la Vina, undertook to assert and did in fact\u00a0 assert her right\u00a0 to subrogation\u00a0 within the period of thirty days prescribed in the above set-out article of the Civil Code.<\/p><p>We are of opinion, therefore, that the trial judge properly recognized her claim to subrogation, and that the judgment of the lower\u00a0 court should\u00a0 be affirmed, with the\u00a0 costs of this instance against the appellants.\u00a0 So ordered.<\/p><p><em>Torres, Mapa,\u00a0 Johnson,<\/em> and <em>Moreland, JJ<\/em>., concur.<\/p><\/div>",

Movellan &amp; Angulo. The plaintiff continued to keep\u00a0 said\u00a0 vessels insured on behalf of the defendant, causing the policies to be renewed each year\u00a0 for nine years.\u00a0\u00a0 The insurance premiums were paid by the plaintiff each year up to and including a portion of the year\u00a0 1909, the sums so paid being charged by the plaintiff on its books against the\u00a0 defendant in its\u00a0 current account.\u00a0 In the month of June of that year the plaintiff began\u00a0 an action against the defendant for the recovery of the amount due upon its current account with the defendant, no reference being made in the complaint in that action to the\u00a0 sum sued for in the action at bar.\u00a0 What the status of that action is we do not know.\u00a0\u00a0 Later, and on the 18th of March,\u00a0 1910, the plaintiff began this action for the recovery of premiums paid during the years 1907, 1908, and 1909.\u00a0 During these three years one of the vessels in question, the<i> Serantes<\/i>, was insured in the. name of the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>The appellant\u00a0 raises six questions on this appeal, asserting (1) that the\u00a0 vessel Serantes, having been insured in the name\u00a0 of Gutierrez Hermanos, the defendant is not chargeable with the payment of the insurance premiums, although it is admitted that it is the owner of the vessel; (2)\u00a0 that having paid the said insurance premiums after the plaintiff had\u00a0 closed its current account with the defendant, such payments can not be said to have been made on behalf of the defendant, for the. reason\u00a0 that\u00a0 the\u00a0 closing of the account and the commencement of an action thereon severed all relations\u00a0 of every kind between the parties and the plaintiff had no authority to act thereafter for the defendant; (3)\u00a0 that at the time of the payment by\u00a0 the plaintiff of the insurance premiums in controversy the insurance-company to which such premiums were paid was owing to the defendant the sum of P8,000 upon a contract of insurance for the\u00a0 payment of repairs made by the defendant on said vessels, which repairs were covered by said policies of insurance, and\u00a0 that the plaintiff having paid, without protest or objection of any kind, said premiums while\u00a0 the claim of defendant for said sum was still pending and unsettled, such act of the plaintiff had precluded the defendant from recovering said sum from such insurance company;\u00a0 (4)\u00a0 that the plaintiff was not acting as\u00a0 the\u00a0 agent\u00a0 of the defendant in securing the insurance for which the premiums in controversy\u00a0 were paid; (5)\u00a0 that the plaintiff,\u00a0 having already brought an action upon its account current in which should appear the\u00a0 premiums in controversy and\u00a0 all\u00a0 of the other premiums paid prior to the\u00a0 year 1909,\u00a0 the plaintiff can not now maintain a separate action upon the theory that it was acting as the commission agent of the defendant;\u00a0 and (6) that the premiums in\u00a0 controversy\u00a0 paid\u00a0 by\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiff resulted in no benefit to the defendant.<br\/><br\/>Relative to the first Question, it is undoubted from the proofs that the vessel Sermies was insured in the\u00a0 name of the plaintiff, while the Comillas was insured in the\u00a0 name of the defendant.\u00a0\u00a0 It appears, however,\u00a0 from the letters of the defendant to the plaintiff and by the testimony of Tomas Oria, manager of the defendant company, that the\u00a0 plaintiff in insuring the Serantes acted\u00a0 merely as\u00a0 the commercial agent\u00a0 of the defendant and under its orders; that all of the payments made by the plaintiff of insurance premiums prior to the 1st day of June, 1909, were charged to the defendant in the account current upon the books of the plaintiff; that the plaintiff had charged no commission; and that all of the damages which had occurred to the vessels prior to that time had been paid by the insurance company to the defendant, notwithstanding the fact that the Serantes was insured in the name of the plaintiff.\u00a0 Moreover, we find no terms in the insurance policy which forbid the insurance of the vessel in the name of the plaintiff.\u00a0 Furthermore, it appears from the correspondence between the defendant and the insurance company, through\u00a0 Movellan &amp; Angulo\u00a0 of Paris, that, although it was the fact that the vessel Serantes was insured in the name of\u00a0 the plaintiff, instead of the defendant, a fact known, of course, to the insurance company, the latter, nevertheless, recognized its responsibility to the defendant upon the policy covering the said ship.<br\/><br\/>It\u00a0 should be\u00a0 further noted\u00a0 that, in the correspondence passing between the plaintiff and the defendant, it is continually recognized that the insurance of the vessel Serantes, as well as the Camillas, was made for and on\u00a0 behalf and in benefit\u00a0 of\u00a0 the defendant;\u00a0\u00a0 In\u00a0 that correspondence\u00a0 the plaintiff was\u00a0 continually asking defendant for funds with which to pay the insurance premiums on said vessel, as well as on the Comillas.\u00a0\u00a0 (Art. 246, Commercial Code and art. 717, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>Relative to\u00a0 the second question raised by the\u00a0 appellant, namely, that the plaintiff having closed the current account with\u00a0 the defendant prior to\u00a0 the payment of the insurance premiums\u00a0 which are the\u00a0 subject-matter of this action, it could not, thereafter, begin a separate action to recover for the payment of said premiums,\u00a0 it appears that\u00a0 the objection urged in this question is directed rather\u00a0 at\u00a0 a\u00a0 method of procedure than to a question of\u00a0 substantive\u00a0 law.\u00a0 From this point of view\u00a0 the defendant has some cause for complaint. Under the practice prevailing in the Islands under the Code of\u00a0 Civil Procedure, the plaintiff\u00a0 should have\u00a0 brought one action instead of two, combining its claim upon the account current with\u00a0 its claim for the payment of the\u00a0 insurance premiums involved in this suit.\u00a0 The payment\u00a0 of the\u00a0 insurance premiums in controversy\u00a0 having been made after the commencement of the action upon the\u00a0 account-current, the plaintiff, instead of beginning a separate action for the recovery of said premiums, would' have followed a better practice if it had amended its complaint in\u00a0 the other action or added thereto a supplementary complaint.\u00a0 It was not, however, as a\u00a0 matter of law, obliged to do this, but it could have been forced to do so by\u00a0 the defendant if\u00a0 it had taken the proper steps.\u00a0 It is undoubted that it would have been the duty of the trial court, upon proper motion\u00a0 of the defendant, to consolidate the two actions into one.\u00a0 The defendant,\u00a0 however, not having\u00a0 taken any\u00a0 steps\u00a0 whatever to accomplish\u00a0 this result, can\u00a0 not\u00a0 be heard to\u00a0 raise that question in the manner in which it seeks to raise it.<br\/><br\/>As\u00a0 to the second and fourth\u00a0 questions raised by the appellant, little needs to be said.\u00a0\u00a0 The whole case as presented, both by the oral testimony and the exhibits,\u00a0 demonstrates beyond shadow of doubt that the plaintiff was acting as the agent\u00a0 of the defendant in placing the\u00a0 insurance upon the vessels in question and that such act redounded to its benefit. The idea presented\u00a0 in argument of counsel for appellant, that all relations were broken\u00a0 off and terminated by the commencement of the action upon the account current by the plaintiff in March, 1909, and that, therefore, the plaintiff could do nothing whatever on behalf of the defendant thereafter, wholly loses its force when we observe that, in reality, the plaintiff did not\u00a0 do anything on behalf of the defendant after that\u00a0 time.\u00a0\u00a0 What it did\u00a0 and all it did was to fulfill a contract\u00a0 which it\u00a0 had made with the insurance company prior to the beginning of that action.\u00a0 The\u00a0 plaintiff had secured the insurance of\u00a0 the two\u00a0 vessels during the years 1907, 1908, and 1909, and had agreed to pay the insurance company the premiums thereon.\u00a0 The\u00a0 three contracts for those years had been made by the plaintiff and it had become liable to fulfill the same on its part prior to the commencement of the action on the 30th\u00a0 of March, 1909.\u00a0 The\u00a0 payment thereafter of the insurance premiums\u00a0 for those three years is no proof that the\u00a0 plaintiff was still exercising a relation\u00a0 which\u00a0 existed after the\u00a0 commencement\u00a0 of\u00a0 that action, but indicates simply that it was completing an obligation\u00a0 which it had made when that relation\u00a0 was admittedly in force.<br\/><br\/>As to the third question raised by the appellant, involving the proposition\u00a0 that the\u00a0 plaintiff\u00a0 had\u00a0 paid the insurance premiums at a time when there was pending between the defendant and the insurance company a claim for P8,000 on account of repairs made to said vessels, and that, therefore, the payment\u00a0 by the plaintiff resulted in an injury rather than a benefit to the defendant, it need only\u00a0 be said that there is no\u00a0 proof in the record which is sufficient to sustain the allegation that there was pending a claim between the defendant and the insurance company\u00a0 for any sum which could in any way be affected by the payment of insurance premiums made by the plaintiff.\u00a0\u00a0 We can imagine a situation in which the objections made by the defendant in this regard would be well founded,\u00a0 but there is absolutely nothing in the record upon which we can found any decision touching that question adverse to the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>For these reasons,\u00a0 we see no other course than to affirm the judgment of the learned trial court, which we hereby do, without special finding as to costs.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i> Arellano, C.

By said\u00a0 writing\u00a0 the vendor warranted\u00a0 the title\u00a0 to said premises and agreed to protect the purchaser in his possession.\u00a0 Later the plaintiff was dispossessed of a part of said land by virtue of a\u00a0 final judgment in an action prosecuted against him by Mariano Perfecto.\u00a0\u00a0 The appellant in this case was\u00a0 duly\u00a0 notified of the pendency of said action and, while he did not intervene as a suitor, he urged the plaintiff in this case to defend the action and prosecute an appeal from the\u00a0 judgment\u00a0 rendered\u00a0 by the\u00a0 trial court.<br\/><br\/>On this appeal the appellant presents the following assignment of errors:<br\/><ol type=\"1\"><li>The\u00a0 court erred in fixing P650 as the value of that portion of the land lost by the plaintiff.<\/li><\/ol>As to this alleged error, it appears that the\u00a0 plaintiff lost about two-thirds or three-quarters of the\u00a0 land purchased from the appellant.\u00a0 The appellant, in his testimony, placed the value of such portion at about P700.\u00a0\u00a0 A witness for the plaintiff testified that the value thereof was about P600.

It is not necessary to determine whether this contention is sound or not.\u00a0\u00a0 It appears uncontradicted in the record that the translation and transcription of the\u00a0 record and the payment of P325 therefor was made at the\u00a0 request of the appellant\u00a0 and on his promise to reimburse the plaintiff. In fact, it appears that the appellant induced the plaintiff to take the\u00a0 appeal on which\u00a0 said record was to be used. From\u00a0 these facts it is\u00a0 clear that the allowance of\u00a0 P325 was proper.<br\/><ol start=\"3\"><li>The court erred in\u00a0 including in its judgment the sum of P70, being expenses of travel, etc., incurred\u00a0 by the plaintiff in the action which caused the Joss of his land.<\/li><\/ol>The appellant asserts that such expenses are not a part of the costs as defined in the Civil Code, article 1478, and in sections 487 to 492 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u00a0\u00a0 In this the appellant\u00a0 is partly right.\u00a0 Section 492 of the Code of Civil Procedure reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"SEC. 492.\u00a0 <i>Costs\u00a0 in\u00a0 Courts of First\u00a0 Instance<\/i>. - In an action pending in\u00a0 a Court of First Instance, the prevailing party may recover the following costs, and no others:<br\/><br\/>\"For the complaint or answer, eight pesos.<br\/><br\/>\"For his own attendance, and that of\u00a0 his lawyer, down to and including final judgment, twenty pesos.<br\/><br\/>\"For each witness necessarily produced by him, for each day's necessary attendance of such witness at the trial, one peso, and his\u00a0 lawful traveling fees.<br\/><br\/>\"For each deposition lawfully taken by him, and produced in evidence, five pesos.<br\/><br\/>\"For original documents, deeds, or papers of any kind produced by him, nothing.<br\/><br\/>\"For official copies of\u00a0 such\u00a0 documents,\u00a0 deeds, or papers, the lawful fees necessarily paid for obtaining such copies.<br\/><br\/>\"The lawful fees paid by him for the service of any process in the action, and all lawful clerk's fees paid by him.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>From these\u00a0 provisions\u00a0 it is clear that the prevailing party is entitled to\u00a0 only \u00a5*20 for\u00a0 the attendance of <i> himself<\/i> and <i>lawyer.<\/i>\u00a0 No\u00a0 provision is made\u00a0 for expenses of travel or other expenses of that nature.\u00a0 Bad faith\u00a0 in\u00a0 making the sale to the plaintiff not having been shown, these expenses can not be allowed as damages under paragraph 5 of article 1478\u00a0 aforesaid. The contention of the appellant\u00a0 should, therefore, be allowed, at least to\u00a0 the extent of P50.\u00a0 But inasmuch as we shall later allow the other P20 as lawyer's fees, we now disallow the said sum of P70 included by the learned trial court in the judgment appealed from.<br\/><ol start=\"4\"><li>The court erred in including in the judgment the sum of P850 as lawyer's fees in the said action in which plaintiff lost said part of his property.<br\/><\/li><\/ol>We are of the opinion that the appellant is partly right in this contention.\u00a0 As we\u00a0 have\u00a0 already seen from section 492 of the\u00a0 Code of\u00a0 Civil Procedure, quoted above, the only allowance for lawyer's fees to the\u00a0 prevailing party in an action in the\u00a0 Court of\u00a0 First Instance is the sum of P20. Section 489 of that Code provides as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"SEC. 489. <i> Lawyer's\u00a0 fees\u00a0 as\u00a0 costs<\/i>. - No lawyer's\u00a0 fees shall be taxed as costs against\u00a0 the\u00a0 adverse party, except as herein\u00a0 specially\u00a0 provided.\u00a0 But\u00a0 this section\u00a0 shall have no relation to\u00a0 the fees to be charged by a lawyer as against his client.\"<\/blockquote>Section 494 reads in part:<br\/><blockquote>\"Sec. 494. <i>Costs\u00a0 in Supreme Court<\/i>. - In an action pending in the Supreme\u00a0 Court, the prevailing party may recover the following costs,\u00a0 and no others:<br\/><br\/>\"For his own attendance, and that of his lawyers, down to and including\u00a0 final judgment, forty pesos.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>This\u00a0 court\u00a0 has repeatedly held that the word \"costs,\" as used in the law, includes no lawyer's fees except those fees specifically prescribed therein.\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, the only sums to which the plaintiff is entitled as lawyer's fees are P20 in the Court of First Instance and P40 on appeal. It follows that the learned trial court should have included in his judgment the sum of P60 as lawyer's fees instead of P850.<br\/><br\/>These are the only modifications which are required by the facts of record.<br\/><br\/>With the modification that the judgment against the appellant\u00a0 is\u00a0 the sum\u00a0 of P1,182.42\u00a0 instead of P2,042.42, the judgment appealed from is affirmed, without special finding as to costs of appeal.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

The defendants further alleged that the parcels of land were not properly described in the complaint.<\/p><p>After hearing\u00a0 the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause, the Hon.

but these women, on being informed by Cuison, who acted as interpreter, of Lieutenant\u00a0 Poggi's desire that Valeriana Escarpe should leave\u00a0 her niece, Marifias, in the said barracks, in exchange for a certain sum of money which\u00a0 he\u00a0 offered her,\u00a0 immediately rejected his proposal\u00a0 and\u00a0 left the barracks.\u00a0\u00a0 They went back home, where they\u00a0 related to Facundo Balangao, Valeriana's\u00a0 husband, what had happened, and then left the house to go to the mountains to\u00a0 get some corn.<\/p><p>That night Felix Cuison, by order of Lieutenant Poggi, who had doubtless learned of the departure of the\u00a0 said woman\u00a0 and her\u00a0 niece for the\u00a0 mountains, went to\u00a0 their house, accompanied by several armed Constabulary soldiers, and arrested\u00a0 the said\u00a0 girl's uncle,\u00a0 Valeriana Escarpe's husband, the afore-mentioned Facundo Balangao, and\u00a0 took him to the barracks.\u00a0 Before their arrival at their destination, when they\u00a0 were passing\u00a0 the\u00a0 house of Crispina Marinas, adjacent to the house of the prisoner, he charged her to take care of the house, because, he said, Corporal Cuison was taking him along in order that he might act as a guide in the search for the girl Anastasia.\u00a0 As soon as\u00a0 Balangao arrived at the barracks, Lieutenant Poggi, through Corporal Felix Cuison, who\u00a0 acted as interpreter, delivered\u00a0 the prisoner\u00a0 to\u00a0 the\u00a0 private\u00a0 Valentin\u00a0 Fortuna, who was awakened by Poggi for the\u00a0 purpose, with orders to take the said Balangao to the cemetery and there kill him with the weapon with which the said Fortuna was provided;\u00a0 the\u00a0 latter, complying with\u00a0 the orders\u00a0 of his superior, took the unfortunate Balangao to the\u00a0 cemetery and there shot him twice from behind, inflicting upon him two wounds in the neck and back, after which he reported the facts\u00a0 to Lieutenant Poggi,\u00a0 who said to him:\u00a0 \"All right.\"<\/p><p>Some hours afterwards, the defendant Cuison with several constabulary privates, among them Valentin Fortuna, went by order of Lieutenant Poggi to the\u00a0 place where the body of the deceased lay, and commanded the soldiers to spread out in skirmish line and discharge their firearms into the air; then the defendant, with the private Fortuna, went to the house of Epimaco Sosa to\u00a0 ask him for a dagger to place beside\u00a0 the body of a man whom they had shot, thereby to give the appearance that the deceased had been carrying a dagger.\u00a0 These facts were related by Corporal Cuison in\u00a0 his testimony\u00a0 and were corroborated by Valentin Fortuna.<\/p><p>Thereupon, the provincial fiscal, on September 30, 1910, six\u00a0 years\u00a0 and eleven months after the\u00a0 commission of the crime, filed an information in the Court of First Instance of Cebu, charging Felix Cuison and Valentin Fortuna with the crime of murder.\u00a0 This case was prosecuted against Felix Cuison alone, and the court, on\u00a0 December 28, 1910,\u00a0 sentenced\u00a0 the defendant, as principal, to\u00a0 the penalty of seventeen years four months and one day of cadena\u00a0 temporal to\u00a0 indemnify the heirs of the\u00a0 deceased\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 sum\u00a0 of Pl,000, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay the costs.\u00a0 From this judgment counsel for the defendant appealed.<\/p><p>There is attached to the record in this case the judgment pronounced against Valentin Fortuna, with respect to whom it was held in the beginning thereof,\u00a0 page 2, that no substantial grounds\u00a0 appeared\u00a0 to warrant his\u00a0 prosecution for the crima. of homicide, and he\u00a0 was therefore sentenced to the penalty of two years of <em>prision correccional<\/em> and to pay the costs.<\/p><p>The present case deals\u00a0 with\u00a0 a\u00a0 horrible murder\u00a0 committed by an agent of the authority in obedience to an order given by his superior, who was actuated by unchaste and unlawful designs.<\/p><p>From the\u00a0 facts related, duly proved at the trial, it appears that Facundo Balangao, a former resident\u00a0 of the pueblo of Barili,\u00a0 was killed on the night of November 4, 1903,\u00a0 by two\u00a0 shots fired at him from a revolver by the constabulary\u00a0 private, Valentin Fortuna,\u00a0 at a moment when the deceased\u00a0 had\u00a0 his back turned toward the latter, in the vicinity of the cemetery of the said pueblo where he had been\u00a0 conducted in compliance with a command given by Lieutenant Poggi.\u00a0 The\u00a0 post-mortem examination\u00a0 of the body of the deceased by a <em>curandero,<\/em> conducted by order of the municipal president, disclosed that it bore two wounds, one in the nape of the neck and the other in the back.\u00a0\u00a0 Inasmuch as these two wounds were inflicted with a firearm while the victim was defenseless,\u00a0 with his back\u00a0 turned toward his slayer, and without warning; and as the custodian of the deceased, in firing the\u00a0 shots at the latter from\u00a0 behind\u00a0 without giving\u00a0 him any notice\u00a0 whatsoever, employed\u00a0 ways and means which\u00a0 directly insured the commission of the act without risk to the person of the aggressor, such\u00a0 as might have arisen from any defense that the assaulted\u00a0 party\u00a0 might\u00a0 otherwise have\u00a0 made, the crime committed is properly classified\u00a0 as murder, pursuant to the\u00a0 provisions of article 403 of the Penal Code, since it was perpetrated with <em>alevosia<\/em>.<\/p><p>Although the complaint was directed against Felix Cuison, a corporal,\u00a0 and Valentin Fortuna, a\u00a0 private of the constabulary,\u00a0 from the very beginning of\u00a0 the\u00a0 case\u00a0 there has\u00a0 been\u00a0 strong circumstantial evidence that this heinous crime was committed\u00a0 at the command and by the direct order of\u00a0 a lieutenant of\u00a0 the said\u00a0 organization,\u00a0 Richard Poggi, who, although he remained in this\u00a0 country,\u00a0 or at least in this city, until November 24, 1910 (pp. 102 to 105 of the record), was not brought into court to be examined at the trial.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding the fact that the information on which this cause is based\u00a0 was\u00a0 also directed\u00a0 against Valentin Fortuna, the court, by order of October 25, 1910, in proceeding against Felix Cuison,\u00a0 found that\u00a0 there were\u00a0 no grounds for ordering the arrest\u00a0 of\u00a0 the said Fortuna, yet pages 90 to 92 of the record show that he was considered a defendant, his arrest having been ordered\u00a0 (p. 12), and the judgment is attached to folios 106 to 108 of the record. This judgment does not appear to have been rendered in any\u00a0 other cause,\u00a0 for\u00a0 none was\u00a0 prosecuted\u00a0 against him separately (p. 35).\u00a0 Therein he\u00a0 was found to be a\u00a0 principal in the crime of homicide perpetrated\u00a0 upon the said Facundo Balangao, and was merely sentenced to two years of <em>prision correccional<\/em> and to pay the costs\u00a0 of the\u00a0 trial, from which judgment it does not appear that he appealed and therefore he must now be serving the sentence imposed upon him.<\/p><p>With\u00a0 respect to the liability of the defendant\u00a0 Felix Cuison,\u00a0 it must first be determined what participation\u00a0 he had in the commission of the said crime.<\/p><p>Lieutenant Poggi employed the corporal, Felix Cuison, to get the girl, Anastasia\u00a0 Marinas,\u00a0 and\u00a0 her aunt,\u00a0 Valeriana Escarpe, into the Constabulary\u00a0 barracks, where Poggi was, and\u00a0 the\u00a0 said corporal acted as interpreter to make the woman and the girl understand the lieutenant's desire that Anastasia Marinas remain with him as his querida or paramour.\u00a0 It was also Cuison who, accompanied by several privates,\u00a0 at the lieutenant's order, arrested Facundo Balangao, the unfortunate\u00a0 husband of Escarpe, aunt\u00a0 of\u00a0 the young girl Marinas, and took\u00a0 him to the barracks to be then turned over to Valentin Fortuna who, obeying\u00a0 orders from the same\u00a0 lieutenant, proceeded to kill the\u00a0 prisoner in or near the\u00a0 cemetery of the\u00a0 said pueblo, by\u00a0 shooting him.\u00a0 These acts performed by Felix Cuison, in obedience to orders\u00a0 from his lieutenant, do not constitute real participation or complicity in the crime under prosecution.<\/p><p>It was not Cuison, but\u00a0 Lieutenant Poggi who gave\u00a0 orders to Private Fortuna, and delivered to him the person\u00a0 of\u00a0 the deceased\u00a0 in order that he might murder him.\u00a0 The mere fact of Cuison's having acted\u00a0 as interpreter in\u00a0 order to make Fortuna understand the intention and criminal command of\u00a0 the\u00a0 lieutenant\u00a0 who decided upon and wantonly directed the death of a peaceable citizen,\u00a0 does not constitute participation by the defendant in\u00a0 the commission of the crime.<\/p><p>The record\u00a0 does not\u00a0 show that the defendant Cuison performed any act in any way tending to the perpetration of the crime,\u00a0 nor any of those defined\u00a0 in\u00a0 the three paragraphs of article\u00a0 13, nor that specified in article\u00a0 14, of the Penal Code, as it\u00a0 was not shown that Cuison took a direct part in\u00a0 the crime\u00a0 or compelled any\u00a0 other person to commit it, or\u00a0 that he cooperated in its consummation\u00a0 by some act without which it would not have been committed, or that he lent such cooperation by means\u00a0 of acts\u00a0 prior or simultaneous to its perpetration; and it can\u00a0 not be held that the act of interpreting, in obedience\u00a0 to orders\u00a0 of his superior, the latter's criminal determination, so\u00a0 that\u00a0 it\u00a0 might be understood\u00a0 by the actual\u00a0 perpetrator of the crime, constituted cooperation in the commission thereof.\u00a0 Therefore it\u00a0 is not\u00a0 just\u00a0 to consider the defendant either a principal or an accomplice in the said crime.<\/p><p>But we do find criminal liability in the acts performed by Corporal Cuison, even though\u00a0 he obeyed orders from his lieutenant,\u00a0 Poggi; such liability consists in his having intervened subsequently to the commission of the crime, by furnishing the means to make it appear that the deceased was armed and that it was necessary to kill him on account of his resistance\u00a0 to the\u00a0 constabulary men, who, to lend color to\u00a0 such pretended resistance, discharged their firearms into\u00a0 the\u00a0 air, under the direction of\u00a0 Cuison, at the place where the corpse was lying;\u00a0 and also consists in his having tried to find\u00a0 a dagger to place beside the deceased. Such acts must be characterized as concealment,\u00a0 and since they are not only wrong\u00a0 but also unlawful, the defendant is not exempt from\u00a0 liability, even though he acted\u00a0 in obedience to a command from his superior, because such command\u00a0 was illegal and\u00a0 in conflict with law and justice. Therefore it can not be alleged that obedience\u00a0 was\u00a0 due, or that it exempts the defendant from criminal liability.<\/p><p>The defendant Cuison knew that the man\u00a0 whose body was lying near the\u00a0 cemetery had been violently killed by the constabulary private Fortuna, through an illegal order given by Lieutenant\u00a0 Poggi, and that it was not\u00a0 true that the deceased was an armed outlaw whose resistance to the constabulary caused\u00a0 a\u00a0 fight\u00a0 which necessitated the discharge of firearms at that place.\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, the defendant, by performing acts\u00a0 tending to make it appear that something else had occurred, and to\u00a0 prevent the discovery of a heinous crime, is guilty of\u00a0 concealment, for he took part in the commission of said crime as an accessory\u00a0 after the fact.\u00a0\u00a0 (Art. 15, Penal Code.)<\/p><p>In committing the crime, the defendant must be allowed the benefit\u00a0 of the special mitigating circumstance provided in article 11 on account of his\u00a0 being a native,\u00a0 his scant education, and\u00a0 his status as\u00a0 a subordinate of Lieutenant Poggi, from whom he may have received orders to perform the unlawful acts.\u00a0 There is\u00a0 no aggravating circumstance to offset this mitigating circumstance, so the\u00a0 penalty for an\u00a0 accessory after the fact\u00a0 in the crime of murder, two degrees lower than that prescribed\u00a0 for\u00a0 the consummated crime, pursuant to article 68\u00a0 of the Penal\u00a0 Code, must be imposed upon the defendant\u00a0 in its\u00a0 minimum degree, which is <em>presidio correcional<\/em> in\u00a0 its maximum degree to <em>presidio mayor<\/em> in its medium degree.<\/p><p>For the foregoing reasons, which dispose of the errors assigned, we reverse the judgment and sentence Felix Cuison, as an accessory after the fact, to the penalty of four years two months and one day of <em>presidio correccional<\/em>, and in case of insolvency of the real principal or accomplice to indemnify the heirs and widow of\u00a0 the deceased in the sum of P1,000 and in case\u00a0 of his own insolvency, to the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment, which shall not exceed one year, and to the payment of the costs in\u00a0 both instances. So ordered.<\/p><p><em>Mapa, Johnson, Moreland<\/em>,\u00a0 and <em>Trent, JJ<\/em>.,\u00a0 concur.<\/p><\/div>",

The members\u00a0 of this\u00a0 association,\u00a0 including Cayetano\u00a0 de la Cruz, having decided to lease a building site and erect thereon\u00a0 a chapel,\u00a0 made\u00a0 voluntary contributions for that\u00a0 purpose,\u00a0 Cayetano\u00a0 de\u00a0 la Cruz\u00a0 being among\u00a0 those who contributed.\u00a0 Cayetano de\u00a0 la Cruz, as such\u00a0 member and president, was then authorized by the association\u00a0 to lease a\u00a0 certain building site and\u00a0 to use the funds contributed for the purpose of constructing a chapel.\u00a0\u00a0 So on the\u00a0 17th of May, 1907,\u00a0 he leased from one J.\u00a0 C. Miller,\u00a0 the agent of the appellant, His Grace Jeremiah J. Harty, Archbishop of Manila and\u00a0 administrator\u00a0 of the\u00a0 hacienda of\u00a0 Dinalupijan, for a period of two years, a certain lot or parcel of land, being a part of that hacienda and which is fully described in the\u00a0 written\u00a0 contract oi lease, agreeing to pay as rental P2 per\u00a0 year,\u00a0 the first year's rent to be\u00a0 paid in advance.\u00a0 On the execution\u00a0 of this lease Cayetano de la Cruz, as member and president of the Methodist\u00a0 Episcopal association,\u00a0 was placed in possession\u00a0 of this lot or building site and proceeded to construct thereon a chapel for the use of the\u00a0 said\u00a0 religious association.\u00a0 About the time this\u00a0 chapel was completed an action of forcible entry and detainer was commenced\u00a0 by\u00a0 one Raymundo\u00a0 Sinsuangco in the justice of\u00a0 the peace court of\u00a0 Dinalupijan,\u00a0 in which Cayetano de\u00a0 la\u00a0 Cruz, as\u00a0 lessee of\u00a0 the\u00a0 lot\u00a0 upon which the chapel was\u00a0 constructed,\u00a0 and J. C. Miller,\u00a0 as agent\u00a0 and representative\u00a0 of the appellants,\u00a0 who, in\u00a0 such capacity executed said lease, as lessor, were made defendants.\u00a0 Judgment was rendered\u00a0 against the defendants in that action. The\u00a0 appellants in the case at bar were duly notified of the judgment of the justice of the peace and were\u00a0 requested to appeal to\u00a0 the Court of First Instance.\u00a0 No appeal\u00a0 Was taken\u00a0 and the\u00a0 judgment becoming final\u00a0 was executed\u00a0 in such a manner that the\u00a0 above-mentioned chapel\u00a0 was completely destroyed.\u00a0 Subsequently thereto, and on the\u00a0 21st of October, 1907, Cayetano\u00a0 de la\u00a0 Cruz commenced\u00a0 this action in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila against the appellants to recover\u00a0 the sum\u00a0 of 2,000\u00a0 as damages for a breach\u00a0 of the rental contract.\u00a0\u00a0 To\u00a0 this complaint the appellants, through their attorneys,\u00a0 presented a demurrer, based upon\u00a0 the\u00a0 following grounds:\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 That the Court\u00a0 of First Instance of the city\u00a0 of Manila\u00a0 was without jurisdiction to try and determine this action for the reason that damages for injuries caused to real property situated\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 Province of\u00a0 Bataan is sought to be recovered; and (2) the complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to constitute a cause\u00a0 of action.\u00a0\u00a0 This demurrer was overruled,\u00a0 the appellants duly noting their exception.<br\/><br\/>After all the evidence had\u00a0 been submitted by both parties, the appellee, after\u00a0 due\u00a0 notice to the appellants, presented an amended complaint,\u00a0 to conform, as he alleged,\u00a0 with the agreed statement of facts and the admissions\u00a0 made by the appellants\u00a0 in their\u00a0 answer.\u00a0\u00a0 This amended\u00a0 complaint was admitted by the court without objection on the part of the appellants.\u00a0 The\u00a0 amended complaint is the same as the original complaint,\u00a0 with the following exceptions: (1) A number of unnamed\u00a0 person were made parties\u00a0 plaintiff; (2) in paragraph 2 of the amended\u00a0 complaint it is alleged that Cayetano de la\u00a0 Cruz was the\u00a0 president, agent,\u00a0 and member of the Methodist Episcopal religious association; and (3) a\u00a0 judgment for only P402 was asked.<br\/><br\/>The court below\u00a0 on the 29th of March, 1909,\u00a0 rendered judgment\u00a0 in favor of the appellees and against the appellants for the sum of\u00a0 P402, P2 being the\u00a0 rent for the first year paid in advance, and the P400 being the agreed value\u00a0 of the chapel which was destroyed by the sheriff in executing\u00a0 the judgment rendered\u00a0 by\u00a0 the justice of the peace.<br\/><br\/>The appellants after noting their exception to this judgment\u00a0 and making a motion\u00a0 for a new trial, which motion was\u00a0 overruled\u00a0 and exception thereto noted,\u00a0 appealed to this court,\u00a0 and now insist:<br\/><ol type=\"1\"><li>That\u00a0 as this action is one for damages to real estate situated in the Province of Bataan, under the provisions of section 377 of\u00a0 the Code of Civil Procedure the Court of First Instance of\u00a0 the city of\u00a0 Manila had no jurisdiction;<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>The court below\u00a0 erred in admitting the amended\u00a0 complaint by which the\u00a0 other members of the religious association, jointly\u00a0 interested\u00a0 with\u00a0 Cayetano de la Cruz,\u00a0 were made\u00a0 parties plaintiff; and,<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>That\u00a0 the\u00a0 appellants are not\u00a0 liable for\u00a0 the consequences of\u00a0 the judgment of the justice of the peace.<\/li><\/ol>The demurrer was properly overruled.\u00a0 This is not an action to recover damages to real estate; it is an action for breach of covenant in a lease.\u00a0 The fact that the damages to real estate are involved, as an incident to the breach of the contract,\u00a0 does not change the character of the action. Such an\u00a0 action is personal and transitory.\u00a0 The rule is well stated in the case of Neill <i>vs<\/i>. Owen (3 Tex., 145), wherein the court said (p. 146):<br\/><blockquote>\"If the action is founded on privity of contract between the parties, then the action whether\u00a0 debt\u00a0 or covenant, is transitory.\u00a0 But if there is no privity of contract and the action is founded on privity of estate only, such a covenant that runs with the land in the hands of the remote grantees, then the action is local and must be brought in the county wherein\u00a0 the land lies.<br\/><br\/>\"In an action on a covenant contained in a lease, whether begun by the lessor against the lessee, or by\u00a0 the\u00a0 lessee against the lessor, the action is transitory\u00a0 because\u00a0 it is founded\u00a0 on a mere privity of contract.\u00a0\u00a0 (Thursby <i>vs.<\/i> Plant, cited\u00a0 in vol. 5, Ency. Plead. &amp; Prac, p. 362.)<br\/><br\/>\"In genera], also, actions\u00a0 which\u00a0 are founded\u00a0 upon contracts are transitory.\u00a0 In\u00a0 an\u00a0 action upon a lease for non-payment of rent or other breach of\u00a0 covenants, when the action is founded on the\u00a0 privity of contract it is\u00a0 transitory and the venue may be laid in any county.\u00a0 (22 Ency. Plead. &amp;\u00a0 Prac,\u00a0 pp. 782-783.)\"<\/blockquote>Therefore,\u00a0 section\u00a0 377 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which provides, among other things, that actions\u00a0 to recover damages for\u00a0 injuries to real estate\u00a0 shall\u00a0 be brought in the province where the land, or a part thereof, is situated, is\u00a0 not applicable.\u00a0\u00a0 (Molina <i>vs.<\/i> De la Riva,\u00a0 6 Phil. Rep., 12.)\u00a0\u00a0 The amended complaint clearly\u00a0 states facts sufficient to constitute\u00a0 a cause\u00a0 of\u00a0 action.\u00a0 (Sec. 90, Code of\u00a0 Civil Procedure.)<br\/><br\/>The defendants in the second assignment of error assert that the\u00a0 plaintiff ought not to have been allowed to amend his complaint so\u00a0 as to make him the\u00a0 representative of all the persons interested in the subject matter of this action. We are of the opinion\u00a0 that such amendment was properly allowed.\u00a0 Section 110\u00a0 of the\u00a0 Code\u00a0 of\u00a0 Civil Procedure is exceedingly broad in its terms and there is no disposition in this court to narrow its terms or meaning.\u00a0 We are also of the opinion that this is\u00a0 particularly\u00a0 the\u00a0 class of action to which section\u00a0 118 of the Code of Civil Procedure refers. It would be exceedingly difficult and expensive\u00a0 to require that all persons\u00a0 interested\u00a0 be made parties plaintiff.\u00a0 To avoid this was the\u00a0 very\u00a0 purpose in enacting section 118. The plaintiff,\u00a0 as appears\u00a0 from\u00a0 the\u00a0 record, is the person chosen by\u00a0 the members of the association\u00a0 in question\u00a0 to look after and represent their interest and it is correspondingly appropriate that he should represent and act for them in this action. In permitting this the court is not thwarting their will or endangering\u00a0 their interest, but, rather, is carrying out their desires\u00a0 and purposes as\u00a0 they have already expressed them.<br\/><br\/>In the third assignment\u00a0 of error\u00a0 it is\u00a0 insisted that the appellants\u00a0 are not liable for the consequences of the\u00a0 judgment of the justice of\u00a0 the peace, for\u00a0 the\u00a0 reason\u00a0 that according to that judgment the plaintiff, in violation of the rights of Raymundo Sinsuangco, entered upon\u00a0 the lot\u00a0 in question.\u00a0\u00a0 It\u00a0 is argued that the plaintiff should not have entered into possession\u00a0 of this lot in\u00a0 violation of the rights of Sinsuangco, but that he should have acquired\u00a0 possession by due judicial process, and that having entered into possession in this manner\u00a0 he must suffer the consequences\u00a0 of his illegal\u00a0 acts.\u00a0 In this we can\u00a0 not\u00a0 agree.\u00a0 When this rental contract was executed the lot in question was vacant. The agent, Miller, led the plaintiff to believe that he\u00a0 could place him in legal possession of the lot.\u00a0 It was\u00a0 upon this theory that\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiff entered\u00a0 into\u00a0 this contract and paid the rent for the first year.\u00a0 The record does not\u00a0 affirmatively show\u00a0 that Miller placed\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiff in possession of this lot, but in the absence of proof to the contrary we\u00a0 think it\u00a0 fair to presume\u00a0 that\u00a0 this occurred. Miller then placed the plaintiff in possession of this lot,\u00a0 but not\u00a0 in the legal possession of same.\u00a0 He himself did not have the legal possession as was shown by the proof\u00a0 before\u00a0 the justice of the peace.\u00a0\u00a0 Sinsuangco was the person who was in the actual possession and Miller should have known this and he should\u00a0 have known at the time he entered into the contract with\u00a0 the plaintiff\u00a0 that he could not place\u00a0 the plaintiff in legal,\u00a0 peaceful,\u00a0 and quiet possession\u00a0 of this lot.\u00a0 The plaintiff took possession under these\u00a0 circumstances and proceeded to construct the chapel,\u00a0 which was afterwards destroyed\u00a0 in the\u00a0 execution of the judgment of the\u00a0 justice of\u00a0 the peace.\u00a0\u00a0 In the\u00a0 contract\u00a0 entered into between Miller and the plaintiff,\u00a0 it was Miller's\u00a0 duty to place the\u00a0 plaintiff legally in possession of\u00a0 this\u00a0 lot and maintain him in the peaceful and quiet possession of\u00a0 the same during the entire period of the contract.<br\/><br\/>The rights and obligations of lessor and lessee are treated in articles\u00a0 1554 to 1574, inclusive, of the Civil Code.\u00a0 Article 1554 provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"The lessor is obligated:<br\/><center><br\/>*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*<br\/><\/center> <br\/>\"3.

VICENTE VILLANUEVA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nD E C I S I O N<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TRENT, J.:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, condemning the defendant, Vicente Villanueva, to six months <em>arresto mayor<\/em> and to pay a fine of P300 for the crime of housebreaking.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAbout 11 or 12 o&#39;clock on the night of January 27, 1910, the defendant entered the dwelling of one Ramon R. Ortiz, situated on Calle Vergara, city of Manila. The only question to be determined is one of fact; that is, whether the defendant entered this house without the consent of the owner or any of the inmates. It is a well-settled rule that whoever enters the dwelling of another at a late hour of night, after the inmates have retired and closed their doors, does so against their will and in violation of the provisions of article 491 of the Penal Code. Under these circumstances an express prohibition is not necessary, as such prohibition is presumed.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe prosecution presented four witnesses to establish its case. The first, Ortiz, and the owner of the house, was not at home on that night and knew nothing about how the defendant gained entrance.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nPaz Aspillera, an employee of the office of the prosecuting attorney, was called for the sole purpose of testifying to the correctness of the translation of a certain letter admitted in evidence.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe only direct testimony presented by the Government is that of Pilar Carreon, who was temporarily residing at this house on the night in question, and Nicolasa Concepcion, the wife of the owner. Pilar Carreon, a young girl 17 years of age, testified that she had been stopping at the house in question for about a week prior to the entrance of the defendant on the 27th of January, 1910, she having been left there by her mother; that she had known the defendant from childhood, he being her first cousin and they having both lived in the same town of Baliuag, Province of Bulacan; that the defendant had been making advances and courting her for upward of three years, but that she did not respond; that on the night of the 27th of January she was sleeping in one of the rooms in Ortiz&#39;s house with Fe Ortiz, a small girl; that about 12 o&#39;clock on that night she felt someone hugging her and said: &quot;Do not hug me,&quot; thinking at the time that it was the small girl with whom she was sleeping. At that time a voice said: &quot;Be quiet, because I am Vicente Villanueva.&quot; On hearing this she screamed for the purpose of awaking Nicolasa, and upon crying out the accused caught her by the throat, put his hand over her mouth, and tried to raise her skirt; that then she placed herself face downward and began kicking the little girl to awaken her. About this time everybody in the house awoke and entered her room; that a policeman was called, but before the policeman could arrive the defendant had gone; and that when she retired on that evening the door to her room was closed, but on being awakened it was open,<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nNicolasa Concepcion testified that about 12 o&#39;clock on the night in question she was awakened by her little girl calling &quot;Mamma;&quot; that she arose, entered the room where Pilar and Fe were sleeping and saw the accused there; that she asked him what he was doing at that time of night and he answered: &quot;Nothing; I just wished to have intercourse with this girl;&quot; that on sending for a policeman the defendant left the house; that he had lived with them for about a year in 1907; that he frequently visited their house, they being relatives; that when she went to sleep that night there was a light burning in the sala and also one burning in the room where the girls were sleeping; that she retired about 10 o&#39;clock on that night and on retiring the door was closed and so fastened that it could not be opened from without.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe defendant, testifying in his own behalf, stated that he arrived in Manila from Baliuag about 8 o&#39;clock on that night. After arrival he went direct to the house of Marcelo Valderrama for the purpose of spending the night there. On arriving at this house he was informed by Marcelo&#39;s wife that Marcelo was then at the fair going on at the San Sebastian Church. He then went to this fair, where he met Marcelo and one Tomas Trinidad. On meeting Marcelo he stated to him that he desired to spend the night with him which was satisfactory to Marcelo. After they had spent an hour or so at the fair some one of them suggested that they return to the house and retire. On leaving the fair grounds the defendant asked Marcelo and Tomas to pass along Calle Vergara as he desired to speak with his cousin Pilar; that they then proceeded along this street and on arriving in front of Ramon Ortiz&#39;s house he saw his cousin, Pilar, looking out of the window. He then said to her, &quot;Buenas noches.&quot; Pilar replied by saying, &quot;Who is that?&quot; He answered, giving his name. Pilar then replied, &quot;Didn&#39;t you know that I was here?&quot; He answered by saying that he had just arrived on the last train and requested permission to enter the house for the purpose of talking with her. She replied &quot;yes&quot; and said that she would have the door opened. He then bid good night to his two friends and oh seeing that the door had been opened entered the house. On going up he met Nicolasa and she stated to him that he could not enter because little Pilar was there, having been left by her mother with instructions to not allow her to speak to him, and that he then left the building.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMarcelo Valderrama and Tomas Trinidad testified that they were met by the defendant in the fair on that aright and on leaving for their homes they were asked by him to pass along Calle Vergara for the purpose of giving him an opportunity to speak with his cousin, Pilar; that on arriving in front of a certain house on that street they saw a girl looking out of the window and heard the conversation, as stated, between her and the defendant; and that the defendant bade them good night, saying that he would remain there for a short time.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe defendant is only 20 years of age and is a near relative of Ortiz and his family; he lived with this family about a year, in 1907; he visited them frequently since that time; he is a native of and lived in the same town with Pilar Carreon, and is likewise related to her. He was greatly in love with Pilar and had been for some time prior to this occurrence. His story that he arrived in Manila about 8 o&#39;clock on the night of January 27, went to the house of his friend Marcelo, end from there to the fair where he met Maxcelo and Tomas is very reasonable. The train arrives in Manila about thst hour and there was a fair at San Sebastian. Quite naturally on leaving that fair he would desire to see his cousin and sweetheart. It appears that Oitiz&#39;s house, was only a short distance from where this fair was being held. It is not at all uncommon or extraordinary for people to be in their windows at that hour of the night, especially when there is a fair in progress in the immediate neighborhood. There is nothing in the record whatever to show that Marcelo and Tomas testified falsely. They heard Pilar invite the defendant to enter the house and some one opened the door from within. According to the testimony of Nicolasa herself the defendant could not have opened the door from the outside. Nicolasa said that when she retired for the night there was a hanging lamp burning in the sala and also a lamp burning in the room where the two girls were sleeping. Pilar testified that the door leading to her room was closed when she retired. It is extremely difficult to see how it would have been possible for the defendant to have entered the house under these circumstances without disturbing some one of the inmates. In fact we believe it would have been impossible for him to do so. He would have had to pass through the sala where Nicolasa was sleeping in order to enter the room where the two girls were. He would have had to force his way into the building, necessarily making considerable noise, put out the two lights and open the closed door to the girls&#39; room. This seems so inherently improbable that we are fully satisfied that the entrance did not occur in the manner stated by the Government&#39;s witnesses.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe trial court said that if anything were needed to strengthen the Government&#39;s case or to show that the accused and his two witnesses did not tell the truth it was furnished by two letters introduced by the prosecution. The court further said that one of these letters in itself is sufficient to show that the accused entered the house in questfon against the will of the owner.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThese letters are marked exhibits &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B.&quot; Exhibit A was written by the defendant to Pilar some time in the month of November, 1909, which was several months previous to the occurrence at Ortiz&#39;s house. In this letter the defendant said:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&quot;I did repent my daring feat upon that night. Why should I have entered your house? Otherwise they would not have been angry with you. Nevertheless wreak vengeance upon me. Let all your wrath descend upon me. Punish me, that you may be appeased. I will never do it again, what I have done. Never again. * * *&quot;<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>From this letter it would appear that the night of the 27th of January was not the first time the defendant had entered the house where Pilar was. This letter strongly indicates that the defendant previous to this time entered the house where Pilar was staying, with her consent and without the knowledge of the other inmates of the house. This letter also indicates that these two young people had been caught in some compromising act and as a result the friends or family of the young girl had become very angry with her.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nRather than tending to establish the guilt of the defendant this letter has the contrary effect. If he had once entered the house with the aid and consent of Pilar, it is a strong circumstance to show that she aided and assisted him when he entered on the night in question.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nA cursory examination of the other letter, which was written the very next day after the act complained of was committed, considering it alone, might lead one to believe that the defendant did admit in this letter that he forcibly entered Ortiz&#39;s house; but the defendant did not intend to make this admission in his letter. The whole letter shows the contrary to be true. That the defendant repented of his conduct in entering Ortiz&#39;s house at that time there can be no question; but this letter indicates that he only entered at the request and with the connivance of the young girl, and that while in there they were caught in some compromising position. This is why he felt so remorseful and also why he said in his letter: &quot;I would feel remorseful for having entered your house as I did and thus offending your honor.&quot;<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nTaking into consideration these two letters, together with all the other testimony of record, and particularly that of Nicolasa, wherein she states that the door could not have been, opened from without, we think there can be no question about the innocence of the defendant.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFor these reasons the judgment appealed from is reversed and the defendant acquitted, with costs <em>de oficio<\/em>. So ordered.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<em>Arellano, C. J., Mapa, Johnson, Carson<\/em>, and <em>Moreland, JJ.<\/em>, concur.<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<hr \/>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>DISSENTING<\/em><br \/>\r\n&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><br \/>\r\n<strong>TORRES, <em>J.<\/em>,<\/strong><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI think that the judgment should be affirmed with costs.<\/p>",

S. <i>vs.<\/i> Fortaleza (12 Phil. Rep., 472).<br\/><br\/>The judgment of conviction of the\u00a0 court below must, therefore, be reversed, unless the evidence discloses that having made the arrest, the defendant arbitrarily and without legal authority, as it is alleged, caused the complaining witness to be detained for a period of three days without having him\u00a0 brought before the proper judicial authority for the investigation and trial of the charge on which he was arrested.\u00a0 But so far as we can gather from the extremely meagre record in this case the arrested man was in fact brought before a justice of the peace as soon as \"practicable\" after his arrest.\u00a0 True, three days were expended in doing so, but it was conclusively proven at the trial that at the time of the arrest neither the local justice of the peace nor his auxiliary were in the municipality, and to reach the justice of the peace of either of the two adjoining municipalities, it was necessary to take a long journey by boat.\u00a0 The evidence discloses, moreover, that with all practicable dispatch,\u00a0 the prisoner was forwarded\u00a0 first to one and then to the other of the adjoining municipalities for trial, the failure to secure trial on the first occasion being due to the fact that the written complaint, which was intrusted to the policeman in charge of the\u00a0 prisoner, was either lost or stolen.\u00a0 It does not\u00a0 appear why the prisoner was not sent to the same municipality on both occasions, but in tne absence of proof we\u00a0 must assume that in this respect the officers in charge were controlled by local conditions,\u00a0 changes in the weather, or the like,\u00a0 which, as appears from the uncontradicted evidence\u00a0 of record, made the journey by boats safer and more commodious sometimes to one and\u00a0 sometimes to the other of the two adjoining municipalities.<br\/><br\/>It may be that the defendant was not friendly to the arrested man, and that he was not sorry to see him exposed to considerable inconvenience and delay in the proceedings incident to his trial, but there is nothing in this record upon which to base a finding that this defendant caused the arrest and the subsequent detention of the prisoner otherwise than in the due performance of his official duties; and there can be no doubt of his lawfuly authority in the premises.\u00a0 The trial judge lays great stress\u00a0 upon the trivial nature of the offense for which\u00a0 the arrest was made, but keeping in mind the fact that there was no\u00a0 judicial officer in the remote communiity where the incident occurred at the time of the arrest, and no certainty of the early return of the absent justice of the peace, or his auxiliary, we are not prepared to hold, in the absence\u00a0 of\u00a0 all the evidence on this point that in a particular case of a defiance of local authority by the willful violation of a local ordinance, it was not necessary, or at least expedient, to make an arrest and send the offender forthwith to the justice of the peace of\u00a0 a neighboring municipality, if only to convince\u00a0 all would-be offenders that the forces of law and order were supreme, even in the absence of the local municipal judicial officers.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the lower court convicting and sentencing the defendant must be reversed and he is hereby acquitted of the offense with which he is charged, with the costs in both instances de oficio.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano,\u00a0 C.

I answered no, that I did not know them, and then asked him 'What reason have you that you are asking for these men?' and he answered, 'I would like to know that because I was intending to go to a house where there is some money. His name is Ignacio,\u00a0 a merchant.'\u00a0\u00a0 The conversation continued, and the accused said, 'I need those two men because they know Ignacio, and even if I do not know Ignacio I can do the business myself\/\u00a0 I said\u00a0 to him, 'Why, are you not afraid?'\u00a0 And the accused said, 'I am not afraid because only Ignacio and his mother and a little girl\u00a0 live\u00a0 in that house,' and he then\u00a0 said to me that Ignacio, the merchant, had some money and\u00a0 he said to me that\u00a0 he saw when Ignacio was counting the money.\u00a0\u00a0 He said,\u00a0 'I was\u00a0 hunting\u00a0 those men,\u00a0 Angel and\u00a0 Apolinar, because I would like, to\u00a0 catch Ignacio because he has some money and is trying to\u00a0 go\u00a0 to Iloilo,'\u00a0 I told him that I thought\u00a0 it\u00a0 was not a good\u00a0 thing and as the house is within the\u00a0 municipality I\u00a0 thought the business was risky and he said to me, 'Although that\u00a0 house is within the town\u00a0 there\u00a0 are\u00a0 no houses near\u00a0 and\u00a0 it\u00a0 is separated from the other houses,' and then he bid me\u00a0 good-by and went to Silay.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The next witness was Mr. Barber,\u00a0 a captain in the Constabulary, who identified\u00a0 the trunk\u00a0 and the basket, and their contents, which were taken from the defendant\u00a0 at Iloilo.<br\/><br\/>Guillermo Julayco testified that he knew the defendant; that the\u00a0 last time he saw\u00a0 him was about 9\u00a0 o'clock on the morning of May 4, 1910, coming out of the house of Ignacio Ferrero,\u00a0 walking toward the street,\u00a0 with\u00a0 his hand under his coat pocket as if he were carrying\u00a0 something heavy in\u00a0 it.<br\/><br\/>Severina Apao testified that the defendant and his <i>querida<\/i> were living in her house; that early on the morning of the day when Petra Magallon was murdered the\u00a0 defendant left her house, saying that he was going to the house of one Cesar to get some money;\u00a0 that he came back about\u00a0 noon, bringing some money wrapped in a handkerchief which he turned over to his <i>querida <\/i>Lucia; that on that\u00a0 same afternoon the defendant and his querida left for Iloilo on a <i>lorcha.<\/i><br\/>.<br\/>Filomena de la Roma (<i>alias <\/i>Lucia), the defendant's <i>querida,<\/i> was called as a witness for the prosecution and testified that she had lived with the defendant before\u00a0 he\u00a0 was married, but that after he got married they separated and she went to Iloilo; that\u00a0 they again began living together in April; that the defendant left the house where they were living\u00a0 about 5 o'clock on the morning of the day Petra Magallon was murdered\u00a0 and returned about 11 o'clock of the same day; that on his return he brought a little less than P100 in cash\u00a0 and turned it over to her and told her to keep it in the trunk;\u00a0 that she\u00a0 put\u00a0 this money in the trunk without counting it; that on the same afternoon about 2 o'clock, they left for Iloilo on a <i>lorcha<\/i>, taking the money with them; that while in Iloilo they\u00a0 bought the trunk which had been exhibited in court, and\u00a0 also the following articles.<br\/><blockquote>\"A new pair of men's patent leather American make Regal shoes; one pair of ladies' shoes, new; a new Roskopf watch and chain; a set of\u00a0 two cuff buttons and two shirt buttons, new; two collars, new; two\u00a0 men's shirts, new; one\u00a0 pair of ladies' stockings, new? two\u00a0 men's new neckties; one pair of socks, new, for men; new necktie scarf pin;\u00a0 woolen\u00a0 cloth for man's pants, new; a\u00a0 piece of white muslin, new;\u00a0 cloth for woman's shirt, new; six\u00a0 pieces of lace embroidery, new, and a pair of armlets, new.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>She\u00a0 testified further that\u00a0 this hat (the one which was exhibited and identified as belonging to Ignacio) was bought in Iloilo, but that she could not state the shape of it because they bought it at night, and that the .defendant never wore this hat at any time.<br\/><br\/>The witnesses presented by the defense were the father and wife of the defendant, Florentino Lastimoso,\u00a0 and the defendant himself.\u00a0 According to the testimony of defendant's father he, the defendant,\u00a0 owned, at the time of this trial, four carabaos and had gathered\u00a0 in April, 1910, from sugar fields\u00a0 which he had\u00a0 rented, 380 piculs\u00a0 of\u00a0 sugar.\u00a0 This witness also testified that his son came to his house\u00a0 (the defendant and witness were living together) on Wednesday, May 4, to get some money; that\u00a0 on that day he gave the defendant P50; that on the\u00a0 same day he, defendant, got P15 from Florentino Lastimoso, and that he also got P20 from his\u00a0 wife the day before.\u00a0\u00a0 Lastimoso corroborates the testimony of this witness with reference to the P15 turned over to the defendant by him, and so does\u00a0 the wife of the defendant with reference to the P20 which she claims she gave the defendant.<br\/><br\/>Ciriaco Levente, the defendant, married, and about\u00a0 26 years of age, testifying in his\u00a0 own behalf, stated that\u00a0 he and his<i> querida<\/i>, Filomena (<i>alias <\/i> Lucia), left Silay on a lorcha on\u00a0 the afternoon of\u00a0 May\u00a0 4 for\u00a0 Iloilo, arriving\u00a0 at their destination\u00a0 about 4 p. m.\u00a0 on the following day; that he took with\u00a0 him on this trip P85 which\u00a0 he had received from his wife, his father,\u00a0 and Florentino; that he and his concubine bought in\u00a0 Iloilo the\u00a0 articles, including the hat, mentioned by the witness Ferrero and enumerated by Filomena ; that when\u00a0 he was arrested in Iloilo on May 6 he had these articles\u00a0 in his possession;\u00a0 that he did go\u00a0 to the house of Ferrero, at about 7.30 p. m. on May 3, to get a drink\u00a0 of water and that he was\u00a0 also there on May 1, but\u00a0 he denied having tried to borrow P5 from Ferrero on April 28, and also denied that he was in the church in Silay on the morning of the 4th of May; that he did not have\u00a0 a conversation with\u00a0 Marciano Castellanes on April 28.\u00a0 On\u00a0 being asked about the\u00a0 380 piculs of sugar which Ms father testified he, defendant, had gathered from his fields, he stated that\u00a0 he did not receive this sugar.<br\/><br\/>After his arrest and return to the town of Silay the justice of the peace held\u00a0 a preliminary investigation\u00a0 and the accused, at his own request, testified as a witness in his own behalf.\u00a0 His\u00a0 testimony\u00a0 then taken was reduced to writing and duly\u00a0 presented at the trial\u00a0 of this\u00a0 cause.\u00a0 In\u00a0 this preliminary investigation the defendant testified that the woman Filomena\u00a0 (alias Lucia)\u00a0 was his wife and that the money which they spent in Iloilo belonged to this woman, she having received\u00a0 same\u00a0 from\u00a0 her former\u00a0 husband,\u00a0 a\u00a0 Chinaman, some two and a half years before; and that he did not leave the house where he was stopping at any time on Wednesday morning, May 4.\u00a0\u00a0 While on the trial of this case in the Court of\u00a0 First Instance he testified that the money with which he bought the trunk and other articles in Iloilo, and also the money which he lost in gambling in that city, was money which he had received\u00a0 from his wife, his father, and from Florentino.<br\/><br\/>That Petra Magallon was murdered in her house on the 4th of May and robbed there can be no question.\u00a0 She was left alone on that morning by her son.\u00a0\u00a0 There was P300 in the trunk in her house at that time.\u00a0 The defendant is a comparatively young man and had abandoned his wife and was then living with another woman.\u00a0 He knew\u00a0 that there was money in Ferrero's house as\u00a0 he had seen him counting it on the 28th of April, just\u00a0 six days\u00a0 before the murder occurred.\u00a0\u00a0 He had no money and attempted to borrow some from Ferrero.\u00a0\u00a0 He was in Ferrero's house again\u00a0 on the 1st and\u00a0 3d of May.\u00a0 He knew that\u00a0 Ferrero\u00a0 would\u00a0 not be\u00a0 at home on the morning of the 4th\u00a0 of May,\u00a0 and he was seen on that morning coming out of the house of Ferrero holding his pocket as if he were carrying something of some weight. On the 28th of April he was seeking two men to assist him in securing Ferrero's money.\u00a0 He returned on May 4th\u00a0 to the house where he and\u00a0 his concubine were\u00a0 stopping with a certain\u00a0 amount of money which he turned over\u00a0 to his <i> querida.<\/i>\u00a0 He, in company with his <i>querida,<\/i> left that afternoon for Iloilo, and while in Iloilo purchased various articles of value,\u00a0 which he\u00a0 had not\u00a0 been accustomed\u00a0 to\u00a0 using. He also lost some money at gambling.\u00a0 When arrested\u00a0 in that city, aside from these various articles, there was found in his possession the hat of Ignacio Ferrero.\u00a0 Ferrero identified this hat as his and\u00a0 showed\u00a0 that it was in the trunk along with the money.\u00a0 According to the defense the defendant had not used this hat, but the\u00a0 court below, on examining the same, found that\u00a0 it had\u00a0 been\u00a0 used.\u00a0 The\u00a0 defendant stated in the preliminary investigation that Filomena was his wife and that the money spent by them in Iloilo belonged to her and that he did not leave the house where they were stopping at any time\u00a0 on the morning of the 4th of May. In the Court of\u00a0 First Instance\u00a0 he told an entirely different story.\u00a0 No one saw the defendant enter the house, murder the old woman,\u00a0 nor take the money.\u00a0\u00a0 All of the testimony is circumstantial, but it is strong and convincing.\u00a0\u00a0 It allows the mind to rest easily upon the certainty of his guilt.\u00a0\u00a0 All the facts are consistent with each other\u00a0 and with the main fact established\u00a0 (guilt of the defendant), and the circumstances taken together are\u00a0 of a conclusive\u00a0 nature.\u00a0\u00a0 All produce a reasonable and moral certainty that the defendant, and no other person, committed this crime.<br\/><blockquote>\"No general rule can be laid down as to the quantity of circumstantial evidence which in any case will suffice.\u00a0\u00a0 All the circumstances proved must be consistent with each other, consistent with\u00a0 the hypothesis that the accused is guilty, and at the same time inconsistent with the hypothesis\u00a0 that he is innocent,\u00a0 and with every\u00a0 other rational hypothesis except that of guilt.\u00a0 (12 Cyc, 488.)<br\/><br\/>\"A conviction may\u00a0 rest upon circumstantial\u00a0 testimony alone, but the facts and circumstances must be such as are absolutely incompatible upon any reasonable hypothesis with the innocence of the accused, and incapable of explanation upon any reasonable hypothesis other than that of the guilt of the accused.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (State <i>vs.<\/i> Hunter, 50 Kan., 302.)<br\/><\/blockquote>Article 503 of\u00a0 the Penal Code provides\u00a0 as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"A person guilty of robbery with violence\u00a0 or intimidation of the person shall be punished:<br\/><br\/>\"1. With the penalty of\u00a0 <i>cadena perpetua<\/i> to death, if on account or on the\u00a0 occasion\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 robbery there results homicide.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The\u00a0 trial court found the defendant guilty of a violation of this article,\u00a0 without any aggravating or\u00a0 extenuating circumstances.\u00a0\u00a0 This crime was committed in the dwelling house of the\u00a0 deceased and\u00a0 without any provocation,\u00a0 and also without\u00a0 respect for the age and sex of the deceased\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 These facts\u00a0 must be\u00a0 considered as\u00a0 aggravating circumstances, as provided for in No. 20 of article 10 of the Penal Code.\u00a0\u00a0 (U.

The plaintiff has plainly failed to prove a cause of action. The\u00a0 burden\u00a0 of proof is upon him to show title.\u00a0\u00a0 He must recover upon the strength of his own title and cannot rely\u00a0 for success upon the\u00a0 weakness\u00a0 of that of his adversaries.\u00a0 Having no better title than that\u00a0 which he acquired from Magdalena Cernandi, he can recover only in case she could.<\/p><p>It is undisputed in the evidence that the defendants Luis, Leon and Teodoro Sermonia\u00a0 purchased certain lands from Buenaventura Cernandi sometime before his death and that they have\u00a0 been\u00a0 openly, notoriously, peaceably\u00a0 and\u00a0 continuously occupying the same ever since the purchase.\u00a0 It is the undisputed evidence that the lands which they now occupy are the\u00a0 same lands which\u00a0 they bought of Buenaventura Cernandi and of which they took immediate possession on the purchase.\u00a0\u00a0 It is the undisputed evidence that Buenaventura died in the year 1897, with said defendants in possession of the lands to his knowledge under the purchases referred to.\u00a0 It is the undisputed evidence that said defendants have been in possession of the lands ever since his death to the knowledge of Magdalena Cernandi and the plaintiff, openly, notoriously, peaceably and continuously, claiming title thereto under\u00a0 the deeds\u00a0 which they present in evidence.\u00a0 It is conceded\u00a0 that at the time of such purchase\u00a0 and\u00a0 sale they knew that the said defendants were claiming said lands as\u00a0 owners by purchase, admitting a superior title in nobody.<\/p><p>The court, bases its judgment in favor of the plaintiff wholly upon the proposition that the technical\u00a0 descriptions of the lands in\u00a0 the deeds of said defendants\u00a0 do\u00a0 not now agree\u00a0 with the\u00a0 descriptions\u00a0 of the lands which they\u00a0 are actually occupying; and that said\u00a0 lands, being, as claims the court, clearly comprehended within the description of the lands mentioned in the complaint,\u00a0 plaintiff is\u00a0 entitled to the\u00a0 possession thereof.\u00a0 We do not believe that that conclusion necessarily follows.\u00a0 The description of the lands at the\u00a0 present time may not be at all like the description of the lands at the time they were sold by Buenaventura to said defendants.\u00a0 This\u00a0 for\u00a0 the very good\u00a0 reason that\u00a0 those descriptions refer t,o and are based very largely upon\u00a0 the names of contiguous owners.\u00a0 Contiguous owners frequently change.\u00a0 The description consequently changes.\u00a0 Moreover, it is\u00a0 well\u00a0 known\u00a0 that\u00a0 in the sale\u00a0 of small\u00a0 parcels\u00a0 of land in the Philippine Islands the\u00a0 descriptions have been heretofore\u00a0 very\u00a0 inaccurate,\u00a0 generally\u00a0 speaking,\u00a0 and\u00a0 the identification of the lands from the description alone is in many\u00a0 cases substantially impossible.\u00a0\u00a0 But,\u00a0 aside from all this, the description of the land in a deed is not necessarily controlling as to the lands\u00a0 actually sold.\u00a0 The conveyance itself may,\u00a0 by mistake, describe one piece\u00a0 of\u00a0 land when the intention of the\u00a0 parties was to convey an\u00a0 entirely different piece.\u00a0 Acting on the agreed intention, the purchaser may have taken\u00a0 possession of the land\u00a0 which was intended to be sold\u00a0 instead of the land\u00a0 actually described. The occupation of the land\u00a0 by consent of the vendor, with the intention clear between\u00a0 the parties to sell and buy that particular piece of land, the faulty description in the conveyance cannot later be made the basis for the dispossession of the vendee by an heir who claims the right to dispossess solely by reason of\u00a0 his inheritance.<\/p><p>In the case at bar, from\u00a0 the undisputed proofs, the description of the lands in defendants' conveyances has very little signification.\u00a0\u00a0 As we\u00a0 have already said, it\u00a0 is undisputed that the defendants Luis, Leon and Teodoro Sermonia purchased\u00a0 certain\u00a0 lands from\u00a0 Buenaventura\u00a0 Cernandi; that they immediately took possession of the lands which they purchased and\u00a0 which were supposed to have been described in their deeds; that they have continuously occupied these lands from that day until the present j that they were the lands which Buenaventura intended to sell\u00a0 and which they intended to purchase.<\/p><p>Under such circumstances, the fact, if it be a fact, that the descriptions in\u00a0 their deeds do not\u00a0 coincide with\u00a0 the lands which they actually bought and occupied is of very little importance.\u00a0 The great and important fact is that <em>these are the lands which they actually bought.<\/em>\u00a0 By consent of all\u00a0 parties they took possession of these lands and have occupied\u00a0 them ever\u00a0 since.<\/p><p>Counsel for the appellee lays considerable stress upon what he\u00a0 alleges to be\u00a0 certain admissions or\u00a0 contradictions of the\u00a0 witnesses\u00a0 for the defendants. We have carefully read the\u00a0 evidence and are satisfied that\u00a0 the\u00a0 overwhelming preponderance thereof presents the facts as we have stated them.<\/p><p>The\u00a0 defendant Andrea Pajantoy claims the land which she occupies in two ways: First, by virtue of her relationship\u00a0 with Calixta Pajantoy, wife\u00a0 of Buenaventura Cernandi; and,\u00a0 second, a gift of said land from said Calixta with\u00a0 delivery of possession which has lasted the prescriptual period.\u00a0 It appears from the proofs that this defendant was the only heir of said Calixta Pajantoy and that the land which she occupies is land which belonged exclusively to\u00a0 said Calixta at the time of her death.\u00a0 Moreover, it appears in the case as undisputed proof that said Calixta, prior to her\u00a0 death, delivered the parcel of land\u00a0 in question to the defendant Andrea as a conveyance to her of the same, without, however, executing any instrument incorporating1 such transfer; that said Andrea took possession\u00a0 of the land at the time of such delivery\u00a0 and has continuously retained such possession to the present time.\u00a0 While Magdalena Cernandi was an heir of Buenaventura\u00a0 Cernandi, being his niece, she was not an heir of Calixta\u00a0 Pajantoy, his wife, the only heir of\u00a0 the\u00a0 latter\u00a0 being\u00a0 the defendant Andrea. These facts\u00a0 certainly furnish the\u00a0 foundation for a right of possession.\u00a0 Moreover, from\u00a0 possession itself ownership is presumed\u00a0 in\u00a0 the absence\u00a0 of\u00a0 proof\u00a0 showing title or interest in some other person.\u00a0\u00a0 Magdalena claims ownership of the parcel occupied by the defendant Andrea by having inherited it from Buenaventura.\u00a0 It appears, however, undisputed in the evidence that Buenaventura never had possession of such land but that\u00a0 possession thereof was always found in Calixta,\u00a0 his wife.\u00a0 From this and from the fact that Calixta\u00a0 disposed of this piece of land during the life-time of her\u00a0 husband by transferring\u00a0 it to\u00a0 the defendant Andrea, it is indicated with fair conclusiveness that it was her separate property and that she had the right to dispose of it as she wished.\u00a0\u00a0 This\u00a0 being true, Magdalena did not receive such property by virtue of her relationship with Buenaventura.\u00a0\u00a0 She has\u00a0 not, therefore,\u00a0 demonstrated\u00a0 in the proofs a right\u00a0 or title superior to that of the defendant Andrea.<\/p><p>It is\u00a0 asserted by the appellee, and\u00a0 it is\u00a0 true, that this court\u00a0 has many times held that it\u00a0 will not interfere with the intelligent conclusion\u00a0 of a trial\u00a0 court concerning the credibility of\u00a0 witnesses and the opposing testimony which they present, the court having seen them in the act of testifying and having carefully observed their manner\u00a0 and demeanor,\u00a0 unless\u00a0 the record discloses that some fact or circumstance of weight and influence\u00a0 has either been overlooked by the court or has been misapprehended or misinterpreted.\u00a0\u00a0 (U. S. <em>vs<\/em>. Ambrosio and Palsario, 17 Phil. Rep., 295.)<\/p><p>In the\u00a0 case\u00a0 at bar, however, there can\u00a0 scarcely be said to be conflicting evidence\u00a0 there cannot be said\u00a0 to\u00a0 be\u00a0 any real dispute between\u00a0 the\u00a0 parties as\u00a0 to the vital facts in the\u00a0 case.\u00a0\u00a0 The case before us\u00a0 is one in which\u00a0 the court failed to\u00a0 draw\u00a0 the\u00a0 proper conclusion\u00a0 from the evidence before it.<\/p><p>For these reasons the judgment appealed from is reversed and the complaint dismissed on the merits;\u00a0 title\u00a0 to\u00a0 the lands occupied by the defendants to\u00a0 be awarded to them, respectively.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<\/p><p><em>Torres, Mapa,<\/em> and <em>Carson, JJ<\/em>., concur.<\/p><\/div>",

Cruz, deceased.<br\/><br\/>The objectors,\u00a0 who opposed the registry of the land in favor of the applicants in the court below, claim title to an undivided one-half interest in the land,\u00a0 as\u00a0 the sole heirs of Estanislao C. Cruz, deceased, through his\u00a0 brother Pedro C. Cruz, deceased, their common ancestor.<br\/><br\/>It was\u00a0 satisfactorily\u00a0 proven,\u00a0 and,\u00a0 indeed,\u00a0 practically agreed in the court below\u00a0 that the land\u00a0 in question was originally\u00a0 public land, conveyed to Estanislao C. Cruz, deceased,\u00a0 by Government\u00a0 grant in the year\u00a0 1886; that it thereafter became the communal property of Estanislao C. Cruz and his wife, Eduvigis Manikis; that after the death of Estanislao C. Cruz, his widow executed a deed of sale of the land on the 19th of May, 1896, to Simon Tecson, deceased, the husband\u00a0 and\u00a0 father, respectively, of the applicants, and that from that date to the date of the filing of the\u00a0 application in this\u00a0 proceeding,\u00a0 December\u00a0 2,\u00a0 1908\u00a0 (a period of more than ten\u00a0 years' duration), Tecson and\u00a0 the appellants have successively been in quiet, peaceable and uninterrupted possession, under a\u00a0 claim of ownership.<br\/><br\/>It was further practically agreed and satisfactorily proven in the court below, that at the time of the death of Estanislao C. Cruz, his estate and his widow\u00a0 were each\u00a0 entitled to an undivided one-half interest in the land in question, it being a part of the bienes gananciales (communal property); that the\u00a0 objectors in this proceeding are the\u00a0 legitimate heirs of the estate of Estanislao C. Cruz, and his\u00a0 only\u00a0 heirs, if it be a fact that Pedro C. Cruz (the brother of Estanislao C. Cruz, through whom they claim their right of inheritance) was\u00a0 lawfully married to\u00a0 Petra, his alleged wife; but that if\u00a0 Pedro C. Cruz and Petra were not lawfully married then the land in question, as a part of\u00a0 the estate\u00a0 of\u00a0 Estanislao C. Cruz, went, at his death, to his widow, in accordance with the laws touching the distribution of intestate estates.<br\/><br\/>The applicants contend\u00a0 that the evidence does not sustain a finding that Pedro C. Cruz and\u00a0 Petra, his\u00a0 alleged wife, were lawfully married; and that even if it be granted that they were, and\u00a0 that the objectors are the lawful\u00a0 heirs of Estanislao C. Cruz, through his brother Pedro C. Cruz, nevertheless, the admitted occupation of the land in question for a period of more than ten years, under a claim of ownership, based on the deed of sale executed by\u00a0 the widow of Estanislao Ci Cruz, establishes a prescriptive title, valid even against the heirs of the estate of her deceased\u00a0 husband.<br\/><br\/>The court below found against the applicants\u00a0 on both contentions, and was of opinion that they are entitled to but an\u00a0 undivided\u00a0 one-half interest in\u00a0 the land in question, that being all that the widow owned at the time when she executed the deed of sale.\u00a0 We think that the opinion of the trial judge in this regard must be sustained.<br\/><br\/>We have carefully examined the evidence of record touching the marriage of Pedro C. Cruz and Petra, his wife, and we agree with the trial judge that the evidence upon which the applicants attempt to raise a question\u00a0 as\u00a0 to its legality is of the flimsiest character, and wholly insufficient to justify us in holding that the trial court erred in finding the existence of a lawful marriage.\u00a0 True, the evidence in support of the marriage (and we might here\u00a0 add\u00a0 of\u00a0 the birth and baptism of the offspring therefrom) lacks\u00a0 the confirmation which would be furnished by duly authenticated copies of the\u00a0 pertinent extract from the\u00a0 parish\u00a0 registers\u00a0 (<i>libros canonicos<\/i>) of the church\u00a0 of San Rafael,\u00a0 in\u00a0 the Province of Bulacan, wherein it is alleged the formal record of these events was\u00a0 kept,\u00a0 but we think that the other evidence of record satisfactorily establishes, the fact of the marriage, and further establishes the legitimacy of the alleged offspring therefrom.\u00a0 This\u00a0 evidence was\u00a0 properly\u00a0 taken into consideration by the trial court, not only because no objection was offered to its introduction in the\u00a0 court below\u00a0 but also because it appears from the record that the parish registers, wherein it was alleged the above\u00a0 mentioned entries were made, have been destroyed.\u00a0 (Chua Soco <i>vs<\/i>. Veloso, 2 Phil. Rep., 658; Loper\u00a0 <i>vs<\/i>. Standard Oil Co., 5\u00a0 Phil. Rep., 549; City of Manila <i>vs.<\/i> Cabangis, 10 Phil. Rep., 151; Boiler <i>vs<\/i>. Alcazar, 13\u00a0 Phil.

Rep., 1.)<br\/><br\/>Under the provisions of article 1950 of the Civil Code a prescriptive title to real estate is not acquired by the mere possession thereof, under a claim of ownership, for a period of ten years, unless it was originally acquired \"<i>con justo titulo y buena fe\"<\/i>\u00a0 (with color\u00a0 of\u00a0 title\u00a0 and good faith). Good faith,\u00a0 in this connection,\u00a0 while it is always to be presumed in the absence of proof to the contrary, requires a\u00a0 <i>well-founded <\/i> belief that\u00a0 the\u00a0 person\u00a0 from whom\u00a0 title was received was himself the owner .of the land, with the right to convey it.\u00a0\u00a0 In the case at bar, it affirmatively appears that Simon Tecson, through whom applicants claim title, was well aware\u00a0 that\u00a0 the\u00a0 widow, Eduvigis Manikis, was only entitled in her own right to an undivided one-half interest in the land in question at the time of her husband's death, and that this\u00a0 other undivided one-half interest was the property of her deceased husband's estate, and, as such, of his heirs; it also appears that, although the fact\u00a0 that the Government grant of the land in question was made to and in the name\u00a0 of Estanislao C. Cruz was well known to Tecson, the original title deeds having been delivered to him when he purchased the land from the widow, nevertheless he took from his vendor a deed which\u00a0 falsely makes it appear that the grant had been made to the widow herself, this false recital\u00a0 manifestly having\u00a0 for its object the\u00a0 concealment of the fact that the vendor was entitled, in her own right, to only an undivided one-half interest in\u00a0 the\u00a0 land conveyed; and it further appears that some, if not all, of the heirs of the estate\u00a0 of the deceased husband were living in the vicinity wherein the transaction took place, and could hardly fail to have been known as such to the purchaser of the land had he made reasonable inquiry to\u00a0 satisfy himself as to their existence or nonexistence.\u00a0\u00a0 Under these circumstances we think that the finding of the lower court against the existence of good faith in the original purchase - that is to say, of a well-founded belief that the vendor was the owner of all the land which she undertook to sell him, and had the right to convey it - must be sustained.<br\/><br\/>The trial court, however, having properly found that the appellants are only entitled to an undivided one-half interest in the land in question, and that the objectors (opositores) are entitled to the remaining undivided\u00a0 one-half interest therein, thereupon improperly directed the registry of the land as the property of both the applicants\u00a0 and the objectors in the proportions indicated.\u00a0 Under the provisions of section 19 of the Land Registration Act, which requires \"That one or more tenants claiming undivided shares less than a fee simple in the whole land described in the application shall not make application except jointly with\u00a0 the other tenant owning undivided shares, so that the whole fee shall be represented in the action;\" and under our ruling in the case of Tecson <i>vs.<\/i> Corporacion de los PP.

Dionisio Chanco presiding, declaring that the plaintiff had not made out a cause of action against the defendant and\u00a0 dismissing the complaint upon the merits, with costs.<p>This is an action to test the title and right to\u00a0 possession of the land described in\u00a0 the complaint.<\/p><p>It appears from the proofs in\u00a0 this case that the lands in question were many years ago owned by one Agustin Carlos, a relative of the plaintiff.\u00a0 Agustin Carlos and his wife, Juliana Carlos, had no\u00a0 children\u00a0 and, so\u00a0 far as the record shows, died leaving no heirs except the\u00a0 plaintiff.\u00a0 Getting old and needing someone to care for\u00a0 them, Carlos and his wife took to live with them a young girl of the neighborhood. She grew up with them, giving\u00a0 them the best of care and doing for them all that\u00a0 could be\u00a0 required of a faithful and dutiful child.\u00a0 In the year 1901 the said daughter\u00a0 was about to marry the defendant in this case,\u00a0 Antonio Ramil.\u00a0 The old people, fearing that the\u00a0 husband would\u00a0 remove\u00a0 the daughter from\u00a0 the\u00a0 house and take her to live with him separately, and feeling that this would deprive them of the only\u00a0 person who would\u00a0 give them the\u00a0 care which\u00a0 they needed in their old age, Agustin Carlos and his wife on the 5th day of April, 1901, after the marriage of said daughter and the defendant, made an agreement with them that if they would remain,\u00a0 living in their house, caring for them as long as they should live, they, Carlos and his wife, would give to the children the real estate described in the complaint in this action.<\/p><p>This agreement, which\u00a0 was duly signed and executed by all the parties thereto, assumes somewhat the appearance of a remunerative donation, and it was\u00a0 upon the theory that it was such that this\u00a0 action\u00a0 was tried and decided by the trial court and upon which the appeal is taken to this court.<\/p><p>A careful examination of the record, however,\u00a0 demonstrates clearly that\u00a0 the instrument in question is not a remunerative donation within the meaning\u00a0 of that term used in the Civil Code, but is rather a contract by which Carlos and\u00a0 his wife transferred\u00a0 to the defendant and his wife the lands described in the complaint upon the consideration\u00a0 that the latter should\u00a0 give to the former the\u00a0 care therein mentioned and prescribed.\u00a0\u00a0 That contract was fully executed upon the part of the\u00a0 defendant and his wife. They cared for Carlos and his wife as long as they\u00a0 lived, giving them\u00a0 food,\u00a0 clothing and\u00a0 shelter.\u00a0\u00a0 If\u00a0 the\u00a0 transaction between\u00a0 Carlos and the defendant was a donation it was\u00a0 <em>una donacion con causa onerosa and not una donation remuneratoria.<\/em>\u00a0 One of the leading\u00a0 differences between these\u00a0 two classes of donations\u00a0 or gifts is that in the one <em>con causa onerosa<\/em> the services\u00a0 which form the consideration for the gift have not yet been performed, while in the other they have.\u00a0\u00a0 At the time of the transaction heretofore referred to none of the services which formed the consideration for the agreement in question had yet been performed.\u00a0 They were all to be performed in the future. Under the provisions of the Civil Code <em>una donacion con causa onerosa<\/em> is governed by the provisions of\u00a0 said code relative\u00a0 to contracts.\u00a0 That being so, the arguments of appellant relative to the validity of the instrument in question are entirely inapplicable and beside the point for the reason that they relate solely to a remunerative gift.\u00a0 The judgment is affirmed, with costs.<\/p><p><em>Torres, Mapa, Johnson,<\/em> and <em>Carson, JJ.<\/em>, concur.<\/p><\/div>",

Simplicio del Rosario.<p>On June 7, 1910, a written and sworn information was filed with the court of the justice of the peace of the pueblo of Pasig, the governmental seat of the Province of Rizal, by Filemon\u00a0 Andres,\u00a0 charging\u00a0 his wife,\u00a0 Emiliana\u00a0 Cruz, and Ricardo\u00a0 Reyes,\u00a0 with the crime of adultery.\u00a0 After the required preliminary investigation the\u00a0 said justice of the peace, deeming\u00a0 that there were no grounds whereupon to proceed against\u00a0 the accused, ordered their release\u00a0 from custody, by an order of the 12th of the following month of July; but, on September 26th of the same year, a written complaint\u00a0 was presented\u00a0 against the accused by the\u00a0 provincial fiscal over the signature of the previous complainant, Filemon Andres, again charging them\u00a0 with the crime of adultery,\u00a0 inasmuch as Reyes, one\u00a0 day in December, 1908, knowing\u00a0 that Emiliana\u00a0 Cruz was the wife of the\u00a0 complainant and that their marriage had not\u00a0 been annulled, did lie with her.<\/p><p>The evidence\u00a0 adduced\u00a0 at the\u00a0 trial shows that,\u00a0 because the husband, Filemon Andres, warned his wife, Emiliana Cruz, that she should not allow Ricardo\u00a0 Reyes to enter her house when he\u00a0 (Andres)\u00a0 was absent therefrom, the\u00a0 wife separated\u00a0 from\u00a0 her husband\u00a0 and\u00a0 left\u00a0 the home.\u00a0 Three witnesses, Luisa Rojas, Esteban Cruz, and Juan Reyes, testified\u00a0 that, on different occasions,\u00a0 they\u00a0 each had seen the accused, Reyes, lying with the woman, Emiliana Cruz; the first occasion was\u00a0 early\u00a0 one morning\u00a0 of\u00a0 the month of April, 1908, in the kitchen of witness' house, where\u00a0 they were surprised sleeping together, wherefore witness ejected them\u00a0 from his house; the second\u00a0 occasion, one night of\u00a0 the month of February of that same year, on the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">azotea <\/span>of the house of the said accused, Emiliana Cruz, and because witness\u00a0 was a\u00a0 relative\u00a0 of the offended\u00a0 party and of the accused\u00a0 Reyes,\u00a0 he did not wish to testify in\u00a0 the court of the justice\u00a0 of the peace, although he advised\u00a0 the husband to\u00a0 observe the conduct of the said accused; and the third time, the witness testified he surprised the defendants while they were sleeping together, between 1 and 2 o'clock in the afternoon one day of the aforesaid month of April, in the house of the offended party, and that, as he was a relative of the latter, and also of the accused Reyes, he was unwilling to testify before the justice of the peace.<\/p><p>The court, in view of the evidence adduced\u00a0 at the trial, and on January 3 of the present year, rendered judgment sentencing the defendants each to the penalty of two years four months and one day of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">prision correccional<\/span> and to the payment of the\u00a0 costs, from which judgment they appealed.<\/p><p>The release of the two accused having been ordered by the justice of the peace, during the preliminary investigation,\u00a0 for the reason\u00a0 that\u00a0 he\u00a0 deemed that there were not sufficient reasons to warrant a continuation\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 proceedings, the\u00a0 complaint that\u00a0 was\u00a0 afterwards\u00a0 filed\u00a0 in the Court of First\u00a0 Instance by the provincial fiscal,\u00a0 although it bore the signature of the aggrieved\u00a0 party, Filemon Andres,\u00a0 could not support the present prosecution and confer jurisdiction upon the court.\u00a0\u00a0 Section. 1\u00a0 of\u00a0 Act No, 1773 prescribes:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"Hereafter the\u00a0 crimes\u00a0 of <em>adulterio,\u00a0 estupro, rapto, violacion, calumnia, and injuria<\/em>,\u00a0 as defined by the Penal Code of the Philippine Islands, shall be deemed to be public crimes and shall be prosecuted in the\u00a0 same manner as are all other crimes defined by said Penal Code or\u00a0 by the\u00a0 Acts\u00a0 of the Philippine Commission: Provided,\u00a0 however,\u00a0 That no prosecution for the crimes\u00a0 of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">adulterio, estupro,<\/span>\u00a0 or <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">injuria<\/span> committed against persons other than public\u00a0 officials or employees shall\u00a0 be instituted except upon the complaint of the aggrieved person or of the parents,\u00a0 grandparents, or guardian of such person.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>All public offenses triable in.

Adolph Wislizenus.\u00a0\u00a0 Juan Casipong\u00a0 later\u00a0 withdrew his appeal, so the judgment\u00a0 is final in his case (p. 16 of the record), while the appeal continues with respect to Gregoria Hongoy.<p>On March 5,\u00a0 1909, Juan\u00a0 Casipong contracted\u00a0 civil marriage with Teodora Juanico before the justice of the peace of the pueblo of Dumanjug, Cebu, witnesses thereto being Telesforo\u00a0 Quirante and Macario Pasculado, as shown in the certificate issued by the\u00a0 acting municipal secretary of that municipality; but two weeks\u00a0 after the ceremony Casipong left his wife and removed to the barrio of Bolocboloc to live with Gregoria Hongoy, whereupon the offended\u00a0 wife went to live at her mother's.\u00a0 For the purpose of assuring herself that her husband was\u00a0 really living\u00a0 with another\u00a0 woman, according to rumors she had heard, the offended\u00a0 wife went in company with one Hilaria Lumban to said barrio,\u00a0 where she actually saw her husband, Casipong, maintaining marital relations\u00a0 with\u00a0 the\u00a0 aforesaid Gregoria Hongoy, and although she did not see them\u00a0 in carnal intercourse, still she saw the two lying side by side and on several occasions going together to different places in that barrio, and that there was no one besides them in the\u00a0 house where they lived.<\/p><p>Accordingly, the provincial fiscal\u00a0 on August 24,\u00a0 1910, filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance of Cebu, charging Juan\u00a0 Casipong and\u00a0 Gregoria Hongoy with the crime of concubinage, and instituted this cause, wherein the judge rendered decision the same day, sentencing the defendant Casipong to one\u00a0 year eight\u00a0 months and twenty-one days of <em>prision correccional<\/em>, and the defendant Gregoria Hongoy to two years of banishment, prohibiting her during the period of the sentence from going within a radius of 25 kilometers of the place where the crime was committed, the barrio of Bituon, pueblo of Dumanjug; with half the costs against each party.\u00a0 From this judgment the defendants appealed, but later\u00a0 Casipong withdrew his\u00a0 appeal, as has been stated.<\/p><p>The crime in this case is provided\u00a0 for and\u00a0 penalized\u00a0 by article 437 of the Penal Code, as follows:<\/p><p>\"The husband who shall keep a concubine in his home, or out of it with scandal, shall be punished with the penalty of <em>prision correccional<\/em> in its minimum and medium degrees.\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"The concubine shall be punished with banishment.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>From the text of this article it appears that it is an indispensable condition for convicting the husband of concubinage outside of\u00a0 his home that his conduct\u00a0 produce scandal and set a bad example among his neighbors, and,\u00a0 according to a\u00a0 principle laid down\u00a0 by the supreme court\u00a0 of Spain\u00a0 in applying this article of the Penal Code in that country to a case analogous\u00a0 to the foregoing, in\u00a0 a judgment of June 16, 1888, publicity of an\u00a0 immoral act produces scandal, for by\u00a0 the\u00a0 bad example set\u00a0 it gives offense and wounds the virtuous sentiments of others.\u00a0 This principle was reiterated in another\u00a0 judgment of February 25, 1896.<\/p><p>The unlawful union of\u00a0 a married man with\u00a0 a woman not his wife, when the two live within a town and in the same house as lawful husband and wife, go together through the streets of\u00a0 the town, frequent places\u00a0 where large crowds gather,\u00a0 and commit acts in plain sight of the community without caution and with effrontery,\u00a0 is\u00a0 a procedure that gives rise to criticism and general protest among the neighbors and by its bad example\u00a0 offends\u00a0 the conscience and feelings of every moral person; and when\u00a0 these conditions attend the conduct of a married person it\u00a0 is indubitable that his concubinage with another woman,\u00a0 even though she does not live in his home, carries with\u00a0 it the circumstance of scandal required by the law to make his action criminal.<\/p><p>It is to be noted in\u00a0 considering such complex actions that in order to regard them as criminal it is necessary and indispensable that they be performed by a married man and a woman, or by both, the man being the active and the woman the passive agent, each with separate responsibility.\u00a0 Therefore, notwithstanding the man's\u00a0 withdrawal of\u00a0 his appeal and the fact that the appeal taken by Gregoria Hongoy will alone be the subject of the decision, yet the arguments bearing upon the perpetration of the\u00a0 crime\u00a0 and proof of it will necessarily affect the man who is the alleged active agent thereof.<\/p><p>On this hypothesis\u00a0 and as a result of the hearing in this case, it is impossible to affirm that Juan Casipong, husband of Teodora Juanico,\u00a0 has been living in concubinage with public\u00a0 scandal with another woman, Gregoria. Hongoy, because of lack of conclusive proof demonstrating\u00a0 the reality of the crime with the conditions the law requires for punishing the perpetrator thereof and his concubine.<\/p><p>Nothing would\u00a0 be\u00a0 easier than\u00a0 to adduce\u00a0 proofs of\u00a0 the criminal act, if\u00a0 said Casipong really forsook his wife and unlawfully entered into relations with Gregoria Hongoy, for if they have\u00a0 lived publicly in\u00a0 concubinage\u00a0 and in sight of everybody, various witnesses,\u00a0 residents not only of\u00a0 the place of residence of the offended wife and her husband but also of the barrio of Bolocboloc, to which the\u00a0 unfaithful husband removed in order to live with his paramour, could have testified.\u00a0 The statement of the offended wife and of the witness Hilaria Lumban, who only once saw them together, is not sufficient to prove the aggregate of acts\u00a0 performed by the two accused, with the scandal produced by the bad example set in their neighborhood.<\/p><p>Under\u00a0 the prevailing criminal\u00a0 procedure, the fiscal's sphere of action\u00a0 is quite extensive, for he\u00a0 has very direct and active intervention in the trial, assuming as the Government's representative the defense of society, which\u00a0 has been disturbed by\u00a0 the crime, and taking public action as though he were the injured party, for the purpose of securing the offender's punishment, whenever the crime has been proved and the guilt of the accused as the\u00a0 undoubted\u00a0 perpetrator thereof established.<\/p><p>Perfunctory routine action\u00a0 is not sufficient performance of this duty, but a\u00a0 searching and intelligent prosecution is necessary. There should be an effort to submit at the trial the best and strongest evidence available, where from must necessarily appear either the guilt or the complete innocence of the accused.<\/p><p>In\u00a0 this case it would have\u00a0 been easy to have submitted abundant evidence\u00a0 that Juan\u00a0 Casipong forsook his lawful wife\u00a0 and lived in concubinage in the village of Bolocboloc with\u00a0 his paramour\u00a0 Gregoria Hongoy, for there would have been\u00a0 more than sufficient witnesses to testify to the actions performed by the defendants,\u00a0 actions not of isolated occurrence but carried on for many days in sight of numerous residents scandalized by their\u00a0 bad example. But from\u00a0 the result of the trial\u00a0 it is impossible to conclude that\u00a0 the concubinage\u00a0 with scandal charged against the defendants has been proved, and therefore\u00a0 conviction\u00a0 of the\u00a0 alleged concubine Gregoria\u00a0 Hongoy is not according to law.<\/p><p>For these reasons and from\u00a0 lack of proof of the facts alleged in this case, it is our opinion that the judgment\u00a0 appealed from should be reversed and Gregoria Hongoy acquitted, as we hereby do, with half of the costs in each instance <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">de oficio<\/span>.\u00a0 As the defendant Juan Casipong, through withdrawal\u00a0 of his appeal, is now serving sentence for a crime which is held in this decision to be not proven,\u00a0 this case should be respectfully brought to\u00a0 the attention of the Honorable, the Governor-General, so that, if he deem it just and expedient, he may pardon the said Casipong.\u00a0 So ordered.<\/p><p><em>Mapa, Johnson, Carson<\/em>, and\u00a0 <em>Moreland, JJ<\/em>., concur.<\/p><\/div>",

that prior to the commencement of the action the\u00a0 plaintiff had demanded in\u00a0 due form of the Board of Pharmacy of the Philippine Islands the issuance to him of a license and\u00a0 certificate\u00a0 of\u00a0 registry as a practicing pharmacist in pursuance of\u00a0 section 9\u00a0 of Act No. 597 of\u00a0 the Philippine\u00a0 Commission;\u00a0 that said\u00a0 Board\u00a0 had refused\u00a0 to issue such license or certificate, alleging as a reason therefor that the plaintiff had not registered as\u00a0 required by section 11 of said law and did not possess the qualifications prescribed by the statute.<\/p><p>The complaint further alleges that said Board in refusing to issue to the plaintiff a license\u00a0 or certificate of registry as a pharmacist has\u00a0 failed to fulfill a clear legal duty,\u00a0 expressly laid upon it by the clear terms of the law&gt; thereby depriving the plaintiff of the right to practice his legitimate profession and illegally excluding him from hid personal and professional rights to his great damage and injury.<\/p><p>The plaintiff further alleges, by way of excusing himself for\u00a0 his failure to register within\u00a0 the 120\u00a0 days after the promulgation of said Act No. 597, as provided by section 11 thereof, that at the time said law took effect and during the\u00a0 succeeding 120 days thereafter, the plaintiff was in the\u00a0 interior\u00a0 of the Island of Negros,\u00a0 detained there by reasons over which he had no\u00a0 control, and was not informed and did not know\u00a0 of the requirements laid down by said section 11 of Act No. 597;

These two classes embrace all of the persons who may at the present time receive licenses or certificates to practice pharmacy in the Philippine Islands.\u00a0 There are now practicing in the Philippine\u00a0 Islands persons who compose a third class provided for in\u00a0 section\u00a0 11 above quoted.\u00a0 This class is made up of persons who, at the time of the passage of Act No. 597, were engaged in the practice of pharmacy in the Philippine Islands and who, within one hundred and twenty days from the\u00a0 date\u00a0 of\u00a0 its passage,\u00a0 registered\u00a0 with\u00a0 the secretary-treasurer of the Board as required by the Act and paid the registration fee corresponding.\u00a0 Under the prohibition of section 7 the practice of pharmacy\u00a0 by\u00a0 a person who does not fall within one\u00a0 of the classes above\u00a0 named is illegal.\u00a0 This means that the Board of Pharmacy is without legal authority to issue a license or certificate of registry to any person who\u00a0 is not embraced within at least one of said classes.<\/p><p>This Act revoked all licenses to practice pharmacy existing at the time it took effect unless the provisions thereof were fully complied with.\u00a0 A provision was incorporated in .the Act under which existing licenses could be continued in force and effect provided the holder thereof was engaged in the practice of pharmacy at the time the Act was passed.

It is simply a command to exercise a power already possessed\u00a0 and to perform a duty already imposed.<\/p><p>For these reasons we are of the opinion that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and that, therefore, the demurrer thereto must be sustained.<\/p><p>It is therefore adjudge that The demurrer be and the same is hereby sustained and the complaint is dismissed upon the merits, unless within ten days from the entry of this judgment the plaintiff amends the complaint to cure the defects herein specified.\u00a0 So ordered.<\/p><p><em>Torres, Mapa, Johnson,<\/em> and <em>Carson, JJ<\/em>., concur.<\/p><\/div>",

All interior surfaces of unlined tunnel sections shall be given\u00a0 a plaster coat of cement mortar composed of 1 part cement and 1 part sand upon the\u00a0 scored surfaces heretofore described.\u00a0 This plaster coat shall be as thin as possible, flowed and troweled to a smooth and true surface, and shall in surface and appearance be equal to a plaster's finish coat.<br\/><br\/>\"18. All lined sections or\u00a0 portions of sections and\u00a0 all chambers shall, immediately after forms are removed and pointing\u00a0 done, have a skim coat of cement mortar, consisting of 1\u00a0 part cement and\u00a0 1 part\u00a0 sand, applied by a\u00a0 skillful plasterer in a workmanlike manner.\u00a0\u00a0 This\u00a0 skim coat shall in surface and\u00a0 appearance be equal to a\u00a0 plaster's finish coat.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The plaintiff\u00a0 alleges that it has placed\u00a0 upon the inner surface of the reservoir a plaster\u00a0 coat to the extent of about 43,000 square yards, for 41,592 of which it has not received pay.\u00a0 Under\u00a0 the contract\u00a0 between\u00a0 the\u00a0 Matson, Lord &amp; Belser Company and the city of Manila the contractor was to be paid 55 cents gold for each square yard of plaster coat placed on the inside\u00a0 of the reservoir.\u00a0 In\u00a0 its subcontract with\u00a0 the plaintiff the Matson,\u00a0 Lord\u00a0 &amp; Belser Company agreed to pay to the plaintiff the sum of 44 cents gold for each\u00a0 square\u00a0 yard of plaster coat placed on the\u00a0 inside of said reservoir.\u00a0 The city asserts\u00a0 that it is not\u00a0 liable to the Matson,\u00a0 Lord &amp; Belser Company and, therefore, the latter is not liable to the plaintiff, for the placing of\u00a0 said 41,592 square yards of alleged plaster\u00a0 coat for\u00a0 the\u00a0 reason that said 41,592 square yards is not plaster coat but skim coat, the city maintaining that there is a vital distinction between the two.\u00a0 The\u00a0 city contends that under the terms of the contract it is not liable to pay anything whatever for the so-called skim coat, as\u00a0 it is a part of the concrete\u00a0 lining and other\u00a0 work for which the contract specifies\u00a0 plaintiff shall be paid $9.18 per cubic yard, claiming that the plaintiff, in order to complete the work under the terms of the contract, was obliged to place upon the outside surface of the concrete lining of the reservoir the skim coat mentioned in the contract, and that the payment\u00a0 for said skim coat was included in the $9.18 per cubic yard paid\u00a0 by\u00a0 the city to the plaintiff for the concrete work in\u00a0 said reservoir.<br\/><br\/>The contention of\u00a0 the parties in\u00a0 this\u00a0 action is clearly presented by the letters passing between the various companies interested and the chief engineer of sewer and waterworks construction on behalf of the city prior to the termination of the work and the commencement of the action.

coat placed\u00a0 in the reservoir.\u00a0\u00a0 We understand that the Manila Construction Co. claims that this difference arises in this way:<br\/><br\/>\"The subcontractor claims that the entire

Our affirmance is based on the following grounds:<br\/><ol type=\"1\"><li>There is, by the\u00a0 terms of the contract itself, a vital difference between\u00a0 \"plaster coat\" and \"skim coat.\"<\/li><\/ol>In the first place, there is no provision in the contract anywhere relative\u00a0 to\u00a0 payment for services rendered and materials furnished in putting on skim coats; independent of other work.\u00a0 In other\u00a0 words, under the terms\u00a0 of the contract, \"skim coat\" has\u00a0 no separate, independent existence as a thing apart.\u00a0 It is regarded as\u00a0 something in connection with\u00a0 other\u00a0 things\u00a0 and other\u00a0 services.\u00a0\u00a0 On the other hand, \"plaster coat\" has its own individual existence, its own independent functions, and forms no integral part of any other work.\u00a0 It is\u00a0 given a separate\u00a0 paragraph in the contract and a value is therein\u00a0 set for the\u00a0 services rendered and materials furnished in putting it on, namely, 55 cents gold per square yard.\u00a0 From this point of view, nothing could be recovered, under the terms of the contract, for placing the skim coat alone.\u00a0 Its\u00a0 existence has no set financial value.<br\/><br\/>In the second place, while the plaster coat\u00a0 and the skim coat perform some functions which are identical, they perform others quite different.\u00a0 Both fulfill\u00a0 the office of making a smooth surface for the free passage of\u00a0 the water, of preventing\u00a0 the adherence of\u00a0 foreign substances, and\u00a0 of rendering easier the cleansing of the reservoir.\u00a0 It is true also that their composition is the same.\u00a0\u00a0 Each is composed of\u00a0 1 part cement and 1 part\u00a0 sand.\u00a0 But the point which is important is that the functions which are\u00a0 vital to each are the very functions\u00a0 which show the difference between them.\u00a0 Under\u00a0 the terms\u00a0 of\u00a0 the contract plaster coat was to be placed on those portions of the reservoir upon which, aside from the mere excavation, no work of any kind had theretofore been done, that is to say, on solid rock free from defects; while the skim coat was to be placed only on concrete surfaces.\u00a0 The difference between\u00a0 them consists\u00a0 in the different ends they were to subserve as indicated by the different surfaces on which they were to be put.\u00a0 A plaster coat placed\u00a0 on a surface of solid rock torn apart by the forces\u00a0 making the\u00a0 excavation\u00a0 would evidently perform a service different from and additional to that of a skim coat placed on the level, even and comparatively smooth surface of concrete adjusted to forms.\u00a0\u00a0 It is thus seen that, apart from the difference in\u00a0 meaning signified by the technical definition of the two terms, plaster coat and skim coat, there is a real difference in their use and the results obtained thereby.\u00a0 Such difference\u00a0 is\u00a0 emphasized by\u00a0 those\u00a0 provisions of the contract relative to the construction of the tunnel, which,\u00a0 at a reading, disclose the different ends to which the two\u00a0 substances were destined by the contracting parties.\u00a0 We conclude, then, that plaster coat\u00a0 and\u00a0 skim coat are not the same thing\u00a0 under the contract we are construing.<br\/><ol start=\"2\"><li>The skim\u00a0 coat is an integral part of the finished concrete lining and payment for the latter includes payment for the former.<br\/><\/li><\/ol>That this is so we regard as having been clearly demonstrated by the proofs in the case.\u00a0 The\u00a0 arguments already adduced to show the difference between the plaster coat and the skim coat are equally effective in proving our present assertion, speaking from the\u00a0 standpoint of the contract itself.\u00a0\u00a0 If the\u00a0 skim coat has no independent or separate existence of its own, then it must be an integral part of some other structure mentioned\u00a0 in the\u00a0 contract by which it is completely swallowed up.\u00a0 If it has no separate and independent value given to it as work performed and materials furnished, then\u00a0 its value must be included in that of some part or structure to which it is attached;\u00a0 for surely it was not intended that it should be composed and attached for nothing.\u00a0\u00a0 If the contractor\u00a0 who provides and places it gets no pay for it as a separate part of the work, then he undoubtedly gets it as a part\u00a0 of some other\u00a0 work\u00a0 or structure.<br\/><br\/>As we have seen, it is provided in the contract that the whole\u00a0 interior\u00a0 of the reservoir\u00a0 was to be lined, certain parts with plaster coat,\u00a0 certain parts\u00a0 with 4\u00a0 inches\u00a0 of concrete surfaced with skim coat,\u00a0 and certain parts with skim\u00a0 coat\u00a0 alone.\u00a0\u00a0 For part of\u00a0 this work\u00a0 payment\u00a0 was separately provided.\u00a0 For other parts\u00a0 no provision\u00a0 was made for separate payment.\u00a0 Unless such work,\u00a0 therefore, is paid for by being included\u00a0 as\u00a0 part of the\u00a0 price\u00a0 of other work, then\u00a0 the contractor,<i> under the terms of the contract<\/i>, is not entitled to pay for doing such work.\u00a0 This naturally and\u00a0 inevitably follows\u00a0 from the finding already made that the plaster coat is different from the\u00a0 skim coat and\u00a0 was intended\u00a0 for a purpose\u00a0 which\u00a0 the\u00a0 use of the latter\u00a0 would not\u00a0 accomplish.\u00a0\u00a0 It\u00a0 can not fairly be assumed, however, that a contractor will voluntarily furnish materials and perform services for nothing; and we are accordingly forced to the conclusion that\u00a0 he received his compensation for the\u00a0 skim coat through\u00a0 the\u00a0 medium of the structure to which the skim coat\u00a0 was attached.\u00a0 And this is\u00a0 precisely the contention of the\u00a0 city in this case, as presented in the words of the chief engineer when he stated in\u00a0 his letter to the defendant, the Matson, Lord &amp; Belser Co., that Mr. Thurber confounded the plaster coat on <i>unlined <\/i>sections of the tunnel with the skim coat \"required as the <i>finish for concrete lining<\/i>\" and asserted the proposition that the \"skim coat finish is included in the price for concrete lining as per paragraph 17, page 63 of the contract.\" The paragraph referred to reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"17.\u00a0 The prices hereinafter stipulated for concrete lining and for concrete in parapet walls and elsewhere shall include the entire cost of the materials\u00a0 and labor\u00a0 for the finished work.\u00a0 It\u00a0 shall include the cost of expansion joints\u00a0 as herein before specified, and shall\u00a0 also include the cost of all forms, centers, and any other work incidental to the mixing and placing\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 finished\u00a0 concrete masonry.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>When the excavation for the reservoir was complete the sides thereof were composed of various materials: a portion consisted of solid rock without defects; a portion was composed of rock with defects; while still another portion was earth.\u00a0 In finishing the reservoir, that is, in lining it, these various\u00a0 materials composing the sides as excavated,\u00a0 in order to finish the reservoir\u00a0 for\u00a0 satisfactory and enduring results,\u00a0 required different treatment, depending on the materials which composed them.\u00a0 That this was so is evident. The sides composed\u00a0 of earth\u00a0 or defective rock\u00a0 must be lined\u00a0 differently from the\u00a0 sides formed by solid rock free from defects, if the work was to be done in a workmanlike manner.\u00a0 To meet this requirement there was inserted in the contract paragraph 14, division\u00a0 E,\u00a0 above quoted.\u00a0 Under its\u00a0 provisions the plaster coat was the only thing required to be placed on the sides composed of perfect rock. But \"on all surfaces of\u00a0 embankments\u00a0 (earth),\u00a0 defective rock, or elsewhere where ordered by the engineer, a layer of concrete 4 inches in thickness shall be placed, <i>and this layer shall be finished with a top skim coat <\/i>conforming in all respects to the skim coat specified\u00a0 for lined sections of the tunnel.\"\u00a0 Now, take this\u00a0 provision in connection with that in\u00a0 paragraph 17 above quoted which says that\u00a0 \"the prices hereinafter stipulated for <i>concrete lining<\/i>\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 * shall include the <i>entire cost of materials and\u00a0 labor<\/i> for the <i>finished work<\/i>,\" and the inference\u00a0 is\u00a0 clear that the skim coat is a part of the <i>finished<\/i> concrete\u00a0 lining.\u00a0\u00a0 When paragraph 14 said\u00a0 that the 4-inch concrete layer should be \"finished with\u00a0 a top skim coat,\" it\u00a0 meant that such lining would not ue complete, <i>as a lining<\/i>, until it had received such skim-coat finish.\u00a0 This being so, it follows necessarily that the placing of the skim coat was paid for when the concrete was paid for.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 payment\u00a0 for the\u00a0 latter was provided for in item 39, page 78 of the\u00a0 contract, which\u00a0 reads:<br\/><blockquote><i>\"Item 39<\/i>. - For Portland cement concrete masonry lining on reservoir, composed of 1 part Portland cement, 2 1\/2 parts sand, 5 parts broken stone or gravel, the sum of nine dollars and eighteen cents\u00a0 ($9.18) per cubic\u00a0 yard.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>This is one of the ''prices\" referred to in paragraph 17 of division E, page 63 of contract, above quoted when it said: \"The prices hereinafter stipulated for concrete lining and for concrete in\u00a0 parapet walls and elsewhere\u00a0 shall include the entire cost of materials and labor for the finished work.\" Moreover, the\u00a0 provisions\u00a0 of the\u00a0 contract relating to the tunnel require\u00a0 the\u00a0 contractor, under certain conditions, to introduce concrete as a lining for the tunnel.\u00a0 It appears clear that the concrete lining so required is\u00a0 of the same genera] character as the concrete lining required for certain parts of the reservoir and\u00a0 for the same reasons.\u00a0 Having this in mind, the terms of paragraph 20 of division D, page 60 of the contract, relative to the construction of the tunnel, are interesting\u00a0 and\u00a0 significant.\u00a0 They are:<br\/><blockquote>\"20. The quantity of concrete to be paid for\u00a0 shall be that actually built in accordance with the plans and specifications and the requirements of the engineer thereunder. The prices herein stipulated per\u00a0 cubic yard for concrete shall include the total cost of labor and materials, including the skim coat and water stop herein before described.\u00a0\u00a0 The plaster coat\u00a0 on unlined sections\u00a0 or portions of sections shall be paid for at the stipulated price\u00a0 per square\u00a0 yard.. Said\u00a0 payments\u00a0 shall include all\u00a0 expenses\u00a0 incidental to the furnishing\u00a0 of materials and construction of the tunnel.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Here, as is seen, the skim coat is expressly required as a part of the concrete lining which would be incomplete\u00a0 without it.\u00a0 We can see no\u00a0 good reason for holding that concrete lining which is not\u00a0 complete without the skim coat in one\u00a0 place is\u00a0 complete without it in another when such lining is precisely the same and serves precisely equivalent purposes in both cases.\u00a0\u00a0 We are aware that it may be urged that the skim coat\u00a0 having been\u00a0 in the\u00a0 one case expressly required to complete the\u00a0 lining and in the other not expressly required, the presumption might well be that\u00a0 it was not the intention to require it in the\u00a0 latter case. , This argument would be\u00a0 sound if it were not for the fact that the provisions\u00a0 of the contract under consideration on the subject, although not direct, are so clear in their general intendment as\u00a0 to amount in law substantially to express provision.<br\/><br\/>In addition it should\u00a0 be borne in mind that paragraph 30, page 66 of the contract, provides that:<br\/><blockquote>\"The entire specifications for\u00a0 all portions of the work of building\u00a0 the gravity water supply\u00a0 complete shall\u00a0 be considered\u00a0 as a\u00a0 whole, and items specified\u00a0 under one\u00a0 class of work which\u00a0 are applicable to another\u00a0 class shall be of force and effect though\u00a0 not specifically mentioned.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>We also feel the force of plaintiffs' contention based on the fact that the fanners\u00a0 of the\u00a0 contract once\u00a0 used the words \"plaster coating\" as\u00a0 a substitute for\u00a0 the words \"skim coat.\"\u00a0\u00a0 We\u00a0 do not believe, however, that\u00a0 decisive\u00a0 weight ought to be\u00a0 given to that fact.\u00a0 The words\u00a0 used are not precisely the same as \"plaster coat\" and, as appears from the context, they were used in the general sense.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiffs lay much stress on the wording of paragraph 28 of Article IV, headed \"General Specifications - General Conditions.\u00a0 Information for\u00a0 Bidders,\"\u00a0 wherein, estimating the quantities of work to be done, the amount of \"plaster coat for reservoir\" is estimated at 43,500 square yards.\u00a0 It\u00a0 should\u00a0 be borne in mind, however, in gauging the strength of plaintiffs' argument in this regard that, prior to actual excavation, the character of the\u00a0 soil to be met with could not accurately be determined.\u00a0 It could not be known to a certainty what proportion of the sides of the reservoir would be solid\u00a0 rock clear of defects, and what part\u00a0 defective\u00a0 rock or\u00a0 earth.\u00a0 As\u00a0 a matter\u00a0 of\u00a0 necessity, therefore, each party was obliged to take his chance on the amount of each particular kind of side, and, consequently, on the amount of plaster coat and skin coat that would be required.\u00a0\u00a0 Paragraph 28 meets this condition of uncertainty by providing that the estimates of \"quantities of work to be done\" shall be \"subject to change.\"<br\/><br\/>It is\u00a0 admitted by the plaintiff, by the testimony of Mr. Thurber, that all of the skim coat\u00a0 for the\u00a0 composing and placing of\u00a0 which it is in this action demanding\u00a0 payment was\u00a0 attached to the concrete\u00a0 lining inside the\u00a0 reservoir described in\u00a0 paragraph 14, page 63 of the contract.<br\/><br\/>The foregoing reasons\u00a0 lead us to\u00a0 affirm the judgment of the\u00a0 court below.\u00a0 No\u00a0 special finding as to costs.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres,\u00a0 Mapa, Johnson, <\/i>and\u00a0 <i>Carson,\u00a0 JJ.,<\/i> concur.<br\/><\/div>",

On the 10th day of June a decision was rendered in the case, after due trial, terminating with the following resolution:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"The opposition of the respondents is overruled and, a general declaration in default having been made,\u00a0 it is decreed that the\u00a0 lands described in the application belong to the applicant, and that they be registered in favor of the applicant, Emiliano Soriano, as administrator of the property of Maria Soriano, deceased.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>We find no authority anywhere in the law relative to the registration of lands,\u00a0 or in the amendments thereto, permitting an application to be made by an administrator of the goods, chattels\u00a0 and credits of a deceased person\u00a0 for the registration of the lands of which said decedent died seized. In the absence of a statute expressly authorizing\u00a0 the administrator of the deceased owner thereof to that end, we must hold that such\u00a0 administrator has no such authority and that\u00a0 the registration\u00a0 of lands\u00a0 in\u00a0 his name\u00a0 as such administrator is without warrant of law.<\/p><p>As we have before stated, it appears that the service and publication\u00a0 of\u00a0 the notices following\u00a0 the application presented herein were completed before the amendment of the application changing the personality of\u00a0 the applicant.\u00a0 As a result no one\u00a0 can, from that point of view, claim to have been in any way deceived if the proceedings and judgment below are amended so as to register the land in the name of the applicant\u00a0 personally instead of as administrator. There are indications in the record also that the applicant is the only heir at law of the deceased Maria Soriano and that\u00a0 he is, therefore, the only person\u00a0 interested in said lands, conceding that Maria Soriano died owning the same. For these reasons we do not see the necessity of requiring the reservice and republication of said notices in case we order an amendment of the proceedings and decree in the case\u00a0 registering the land in the\u00a0 name of\u00a0 the\u00a0 applicant personally.\u00a0 We are not. however, fully satisfied that the applicant is\u00a0 the only heir at law of the\u00a0 deceased Maria Soriano and, therefore, the sole owner of the lands in question.\u00a0\u00a0 Nor are we fully satisfied that there were not other appearances in the case besides that of the respondents now before\u00a0 the court.\u00a0 It is\u00a0 possible\u00a0 that there are persons, co-owners with the applicant, who may have appeared on the return day of the\u00a0 notice and who subsequently may have withdrawn their appearances relying upon the amendment of the application making the applicant the administrator instead of Emiliano Soriano personally, believing that, as heirs, their interests would be fully protected if the lands were registered in the name of the administrator instead of the applicant personally.<\/p><p>In\u00a0 view of\u00a0 these doubts, we open the judgment and remand the\u00a0 cause, with\u00a0 instructions to the court below to take proofs as to the points upon which we have herein expressed doubt.\u00a0 If the court find from such proofs that the applicant is the sole\u00a0 owner of the lands in question, he shall, if the applicant consent thereto, register the\u00a0 lands in the name of the applicant personally, amending all proceedings to conform thereto.\u00a0 If\u00a0 the applicant refuse to consent, an order shall be entered dismissing the application.

On June 15, the committee received a letter from the administrator, Serrano, requesting postponement of the hearing\u00a0 to the month of July, as he was unable on account of\u00a0 his\u00a0 health to be present, which request was refused.\u00a0 On July 17 following, Riosa's counsel requested a further postponement of twenty days for the hearing on his\u00a0 claim against the estate, which request was granted, the hearing of the case being set forward until the 16th of August following. At the request of Mariano Riosa's counsel that the hearing on his claim be\u00a0 further postponed to the\u00a0 early part of September of that year, the committee on August 19, ordered the foregoing petition transmitted to the administrator, so that he might state whether or not he agreed to the new postponement requested.\u00a0 Neither party appeared, and the committee after fifteen days adjourned its meetings, leaving Mariano Riosa's claim undecided\u00a0 on account of his counsel's failure\u00a0 to appear.\u00a0 Accordingly,\u00a0 the committee submitted its\u00a0 report to the Court\u00a0 of First Instance for settlement according to law, under section 693 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<\/p><p>In a letter to the committee on appraisal, dated May 14, 1907, Mariano\u00a0 Riosa sets\u00a0 forth that the deceased Tomas Valenciano's estate owes him:<\/p><table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" width=\"75%\"> <tbody><tr> <td colspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\">To balance current\u00a0 account closed June 30, 1901, derived\u00a0 from a commercial partnership between the debtor and\u00a0 the claimant-creditor .............................................................<\/td> <td valign=\"bottom\" width=\"17%\">Pl,509.43<\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td colspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\">To legal interest thereon to date, at 6 per cent per annum....<\/td> <td valign=\"bottom\">525.30<\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td valign=\"top\" width=\"16%\">\u00a0<\/td> <td valign=\"top\" width=\"67%\">Total .................................................<\/td> <td valign=\"bottom\">2,034.73<\/td> <\/tr> <\/tbody><\/table><p>In view of this account and of the recorded oath of Riosa's counsel, averring that no payment had been made on said account, arid that there\u00a0 was no record of any counterclaim against the\u00a0 creditor Riosa, the court issued the order of December 17, 1907, approving the report of the committee only in its first, second and third parts, relating\u00a0 to recognized accounts, and setting a date for these proceedings, for approval of the administrator's\u00a0 accounts,\u00a0 declaration of heirs,\u00a0 appointment of a committee of distribution, and everything pertaining to the settlement of the matter.<\/p><p>In another order of January 22, 1908,\u00a0 appears the following : \"Whereas, at the expiration of the time set by the committee on appraisal, there\u00a0 was\u00a0 pending a claim of P2,034.73 of Francisco Alvarez, counsel for Mariano Riosa, which was not examined or allowed because of claimant's failure to appear on the different occasions\u00a0 when he was summoned by said committee, it is ordered that the accounts recognized by the committee on appraisal in favor of the Chinamen Quien Choco, Dy\u00a0 Deco, and Don Marcelino Vie jo, amounting respectively to P29, P100 and P80, be declared legal, and the claim of Don Mariano Riosa to have\u00a0 lapsed, as well as all others that may be outstanding against this estate, because of failure in\u00a0 presentation in due time.\"<\/p><p>On the\u00a0 29th of July following, counsel for Mariano Riosa filed a written motion, representing:\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 that\u00a0 it appears from the attached documents,\u00a0 exhibits A\u00a0 and\u00a0 B, setting forth the account taken from Riosa's books, that the deceased Tomas Valenciano owed Riosa the sum of \u00a51,509.43 as outstanding balance on the current account closed June 30, 1901, resulting from a commercial partnership between him and the said Riosa, with the sum of P525.30 as legal interest at 6 per cent per annum, making in all P2,034.73; that for the reasons set forth in the attached sworn statement, such account could not be proved before\u00a0 the committee, but that as this claim was not\u00a0 rejected by the committee and the account whereon it is based was in\u00a0 part recognized by the testator himself in one clause of his will (pp. 4 and 5 of the record), and as section 748 of the Code of Civil\u00a0 Procedure authorizes the admission of such claims if presented within two years from the time allowed\u00a0 the other\u00a0 creditors, he prays the court to\u00a0 regard the\u00a0 claim, with\u00a0 its exhibits A and B, as presented and to admit it; and in case it be disputed to order that it be proved\u00a0 before the committee already\u00a0 appointed or before\u00a0 another to be appointed for the purpose, as provided\u00a0 in said section of the code.<\/p><p>Exhibit A is a document setting\u00a0 forth the contract\u00a0 between Mariano Riosa and Tomas Valenciano, stating the business in\u00a0 which they\u00a0 were going to engage and the conditions of the partnership formed.\u00a0 This\u00a0 document\u00a0 was signed by both parties on May 18, 1899.<\/p><p>Exhibit B, dated January 2, 1905, and signed merely by S.

On May 14, 1907, there was presented the claim of the creditor,\u00a0 Mariano\u00a0 Riosa,\u00a0 for collection of\u00a0 the\u00a0 sum\u00a0 of P2,034.73, balance\u00a0 due, with\u00a0 legal interest at 6 per cent, which the estate of Valenciano owed him.\u00a0\u00a0 (B. of e., p. 6.)<\/p><p>The committee on appraisal at a\u00a0 meeting on May 21, 1907, took up the claim presented, fixed a day\u00a0 for a hearing, and issued\u00a0 summonses to\u00a0 the claimant\u00a0 and the administrator of the estate, Ruperto Serrano.\u00a0 After the postponements\u00a0 requested by each party\u00a0 and in\u00a0 view of the new postponement, or the petition that for the reasons given the time for the hearing be again extended, the committee on appraisal ordered\u00a0 the administrator\u00a0 to\u00a0 be informed thereof in order that he might\u00a0 state whether or not\u00a0 he agreed to the new postponement\u00a0 requested.\u00a0 According to the report, the parties did not appear, and the committee adjourned its meetings, leaving undecided and pending the claim of the creditor Riosa, and submitted its report to the court for action in accordance with law.<\/p><p>It is an indisputable fact that Mariano Riosa's claim was presented within the period of six months fixed in the notices published\u00a0 in\u00a0 said\u00a0 newspaper\u00a0 by the\u00a0 committee on appraisal.\u00a0 Decision thereon was still pending, and there is no record that the administrator of the estate admitted or denied it, nor that the committee on appraisal rendered a decision either way on the claim presented, only\u00a0 that it adjourned its meetings after forwarding due report to the Court of First Instance.<\/p><p>In such case, with an account\u00a0 outstanding, presented in time and not rejected\u00a0 by the administrator\u00a0 of the\u00a0 estate, the committee on appraisal was under obligation to\u00a0 extend the time and to\u00a0 pass upon the correctness and legality of the account, collection whereof was under consideration with the administrator's\u00a0 knowledge.\u00a0 Nor\u00a0 for this reason could said claim be declared not presented,\u00a0 or that it had\u00a0 lapsed like other claims not presented in time; neither could such declaration be reiterated\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 order appealed from of November 26, 1906, notwithstanding the\u00a0 notice that the proceedings would be terminated\u00a0 on January 22, 1908, for the\u00a0 claim made by Mariano Riosa for the collection\u00a0 of his account, in part recognized by the testator in his will, was duly presented,\u00a0 as has\u00a0 been said, within the period\u00a0 of\u00a0 six months fixed by the committee on appraisal, and as a creditor to appear\u00a0 in\u00a0 the case he\u00a0 should\u00a0 have been personally notified in order that another new period of judicial character might have elapsed and that he might be held to have renounced his right.<\/p><p>Mariano Riosa's account\u00a0 does not fall within the\u00a0 provisions of section 695\u00a0 of the Code of Civil Procedure for the reason that his counsel\u00a0 presented his claim\u00a0 within the first period of six months fixed by the committee\u00a0 on appraisal, which has the right or is authorized only to reject it in case it be illegal and must not be settled by the estate, but there is no jusification for a declaration by the committee on appraisal or by the court that the right to collect said\u00a0 account has lapsed, when collection thereof was claimed in due time.<\/p><p>Under article 1026 of the Civil Code, Tomas Valenciano's estate is understood to be under\u00a0 administration\u00a0 until all the known creditors and legatees are paid.\u00a0 In accordance with this legal provision, the principle has been laid down in law that only after\u00a0 the obligations of the estate have been discharged\u00a0 can the portion of the heir, or the balance divisible among the heirs, if there are several, be recognized. (Judgment of March\u00a0 2, 1896.)<\/p><p>Section 753 of the\u00a0 Code of Civil\u00a0 Procedure affirms the provisions of said article of\u00a0 the Civil Code and the legal principle cited, by providing that after\u00a0 payment of the debts, funeral charges,\u00a0 expenses\u00a0 of\u00a0 administration\u00a0 and allowances made for\u00a0 the expense of maintenance of the family of the deceased, the court shall assign the residue of the estate to the persons entitled to the same, in its order naming\u00a0 the\u00a0 persons\u00a0 and proportions, or\u00a0 parts, to\u00a0 which each\u00a0 is entitled,\u00a0 etc.,\u00a0 thus carrying out the law\u00a0 and the wishes of the deceased.<\/p><p>We agree\u00a0 that the claim, presented in due time by Mariano\u00a0 Riosa's counsel, is not a fortuitous one, because it is a claim for the collection\u00a0 of a certain account, which was in part\u00a0 recognized by the debtor in his will, together with\u00a0 interest thereon.\u00a0\u00a0 As there is\u00a0 no record of\u00a0 any objection on the part of the administrator to payment of said claim, nor was it disputed on the legal ground\u00a0 that it was not correct or that the claim was\u00a0 not presented in due time, it follows in our opinion that the report dated\u00a0 September 17, 1907,\u00a0 should\u00a0 be\u00a0 returned to\u00a0 the committee on\u00a0 appraisal which made it, or to another to be appointed for the purpose, in order that it may, with the administrator's knowledge, examine\u00a0 the claim presented\u00a0 by Mariano Riosa's counsel within the time set therefor,\u00a0 render due decision thereon, and then make report to the\u00a0 court for settlement three of in accordance with the provisions\u00a0 of section 693 of\u00a0 the Code of Civil Procedure. Tomas Valenciano's estate\u00a0 can not be regarded as settled, nor\u00a0 the testamentary property be awarded to\u00a0 his heiress, until all the legal claims presented within the time fixed\u00a0 by law have been paid or\u00a0 settled.\u00a0\u00a0 Such is the case of Mariano Riosa's account, claim for which was presented in time.\u00a0 Only\u00a0 after this account may have been rejected and there is no other legal\u00a0 claim, can the unencumbered balance of the testator's estate be determined.<\/p><p>Therefore, it\u00a0 follows, in our opinion, that the final portion of the order appealed from,, of November 26,\u00a0 1908, should\u00a0 be revoked,\u00a0 and\u00a0 that the court\u00a0 should make due disposition for\u00a0 a\u00a0 committee\u00a0 on appraisal to examine and pass upon the said claim of Mariano Riosa in\u00a0 the manner indicated, said committee to act as provided by law and to communicate its\u00a0 decision\u00a0 to the court.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 clerk will change the title\u00a0 of this case as requested by Riosa's counsel in\u00a0 his written motion dated\u00a0 December 23\u00a0 of last year included in the record.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<\/p><p><em>Mapa, Johnson, Carson,<\/em>\u00a0 and <em>Moreland, JJ.<\/em>, concur.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 <br\/><\/p><hr align=\"left\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><p><\/p><sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> The original title was: Marcos Pimentel, petitioner and appellee,\u00a0 <em>vs<\/em>.

The grounds upon which they base this contention are stated by counsel as follows:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"The\u00a0 crime with which the above-named defendants are charged is provided for and penalized by a special Act, No. 1740, which has repealed such provisions of the Penal Code relating to malversation and misappropriation as conflict with the provisions of said Act.<\/p><p>\"According to the\u00a0 information cited,\u00a0 the above-named accused were municipal policemen of\u00a0 Calabangar where the crime was committed, and their sole participation therein was that they directly aided Rufino Ponte, the municipal treasurer, in said malversation by taking the safe with the sum misappropriated and carrying it from the\u00a0 municipal treasury to the<em> sitio<\/em> of Inarian.<\/p><p>\"It is evident from\u00a0 what has just been stated that the question relates to the guilt of the accused Alamida, Narvades, Cada, Metram and Verata as <em>accomplices<\/em> in the crime of malversation.\u00a0\u00a0 (3 Phil. Rep., 6; art. 14, Penal Code.)<\/p><p>\"As accomplices,'said defendants are not liable under Act No. 1740, because this Act only punishes the principals, the officers,\u00a0 whether bonded or not, who misapply or misappropriate the funds they may have in their possession by reason of their office.<\/p><p>\"The provisions of the Penal Code regarding the criminal responsibility of accomplices in crimes\u00a0 are applicable to this case, because the crime under consideration is penalized by a special Act, which is the only law that should govern.<\/p><p>\"Therefore, in view of the arguments adduced, the court is requested\u00a0 to\u00a0 sustain this\u00a0 demurrer and order the\u00a0 dismissal of this cause with reference to the accused municipal policemen of Calabanga.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The court\u00a0 below sustained\u00a0 the demurrer\u00a0 in the following order:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"Careful perusal of section 1 of Act No. 1740 shows that it. refers, to bonded officers or employees and any other persons who, having charge, by reason of their office or\u00a0 employment or\u00a0 by operation of law, of funds or property of the Government, who misappropriate, fail to render account, etc.<\/p><p>\"Two requisites are therefore necessary for the existence of the crime of malversation, according to Act No. 1740? to wit:\u00a0 (1) That a bonded officer or employee or any other person by reason of his office or employment or by operation of law have charge of funds or property of the Government; and\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 that said officer or person refuse or fail to render account,\u00a0 or make personal use of the same\u00a0 or\u00a0 misappropriate them, etc.<\/p><p>\"Are these requisites applicable to the accused policemen?<\/p><p>\"No: for the office of municipal policeman does not carry with it any duty of guardianship or\u00a0 custody of Government funds, nor is\u00a0 there any law which prescribes that by reason of being policemen they must take charge of and guard Government funds, nor is it\u00a0 alleged in the complaint\u00a0 that the funds in\u00a0 question were turned over to them; it merely appears that it\u00a0 was\u00a0 their duty as policemen to guard\u00a0 the safe, or municipal treasury.\u00a0\u00a0 The information itself avers that 'as\u00a0 such officials they\u00a0 had committed\u00a0 to\u00a0 them\u00a0 the guardianship and custody of the\u00a0 municipal\u00a0 treasury of\u00a0 Calabanga, where the said sum of P3,795.93 and the safe containing: it were kept.'\u00a0 More clearly:\u00a0 the law does not refer to those who guard or care for the\u00a0 municipal building1 or treasury, but to those who are intrusted\u00a0 with or have in their charge funds or property of the Government.<\/p><p>\"Accordingly, if the policemen abstracted the money and the safe containing it, and carried it\u00a0 to another place, as is alleged in the complaint, they committed the crime of robbery, or some other crime against property, but not\u00a0 the crime of malversation as denned\u00a0 in Act No. 1740.<\/p><p>\"Therefore the court sustains the demurrer, declaring this cause dismissed with reference to the policemen Juan Alamida, Ignacio Narvades, Agapito Cada, Alejandro Metram, and Esteban Verata, with five-sixths\u00a0 of the costs <em>de oficio,<\/em> and orders the provincial fiscal again to investigate the fads and then present an information against said policemen for robbery or some other crime against\u00a0 property.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>We are agreed with the trial judge in so far as he refused to give any weight to contention of counsel for the defense that the information merely charges these defendants\u00a0 as accomplices in the commission of the crime defined and penalized in Act No. 1740, and that there is nothing in the Act which penalizes the assistance rendered by accomplices in the commission of this crime; it\u00a0 will be seen\u00a0 that the information expressly alleges that \"the defendants\u00a0 did, each and every one of them, maliciously, criminally and unlawfully, directly aid said Rufino Ponte in this malversation by taking said safe with the said amount from the municipal treasury and carrying it to the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">sitio\u00a0<\/span> of Inarian,\" thus charging them with having taken a direct part in the commission of the crime, which could not have been successfully carried out had it not been for\u00a0 their direct participation and cooperation.\u00a0\u00a0 Clearly these, defendants are charged\u00a0 in the information as co-principals and not as accomplices.<\/p><p>But we can not agree with the trial court in sustaining the demurrer on the\u00a0 ground that the accused, not having had the money in question in their charge by reason of a public office held by them, could not\u00a0 commit the crime of malversation of public funds as defined in Act No. 1740, the true nature of the crime committed by them being, in the opinion of the trial judge, \"robbery\" or some other of the offenses against property defined and penalized in the code. It may be that the acts committed by these defendants constituted the crime of robbery, but under all the circumstances, we have no doubt that these acts also constituted the crime of malversation of public funds as defined in Act No. 1740.<\/p><p>Groizard, in\u00a0 his Commentaries on article 405 of\u00a0 the Spanish Penal Code, which is substantially\u00a0 identical with article 390 of the Philippine Code, says that:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"Doubt, weighty doubt may arise, nevertheless, regarding the definition of the crime and of the penalty to be imposed upon the\u00a0 private party who abstracts public funds with the consent of the officer charged with their custody.\u00a0\u00a0 Shall the person\u00a0 so doing be <em>guilty of the crime of malversation here provided\u00a0 for,<\/em> and shall\u00a0 he suffer the same penally as the unfaithful officer, or shall he be guilty only of the crime of theft and undergo the punishment he deserves therefor?<\/p><\/blockquote><p align=\"center\"> *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<\/p><blockquote><p>\"Without overlooking the force of the arguments we have just cited, we are inclined to take the first point of view.\u00a0 We are led thereto by the consideration that in contending for the imposition of the same penalty upon the private party who abstracts public funds as upon the employee who gives his consent thereto we recognize the differentiation with which crimes are always\u00a0 described and\u00a0 penalized\u00a0 in the code.\u00a0 In the action which the text\u00a0 describes as a crime there is\u00a0 perfect unity: the private party does not act independently from the public officer: rather, he knows that the funds of which he wishes to get\u00a0 possession are in the latter's charge, and instead of trying to abstract them by circumventing the other's vigilance he resorts to corruption, and in the officer's unfaithfulness seeks and finds the most reprehensible\u00a0 means for accomplishing a deed which by having a public officer as its moral instrument assumes the character of a social crime.\u00a0 If the article were not so interpreted, it would be necessary to\u00a0 agree\u00a0 that the act, in spite of its evident unity, would constitute\u00a0 not one but two distinct crimes, and\u00a0 the persons participating therein, although they acted\u00a0 together throughout, would be guilty of two different kinds of wrongdoing.\u00a0 Moreover, the rule of article\u00a0 80, which prevents extension\u00a0 from some culprits to others of the responsibility that arises from their personal qualities, is restricted by fundamental principles and by the article itself, wherein it is applied to the <em>consideration of the extenuating and aggravating circumstances<\/em> which may affect the persons respectively responsible\u00a0 for the\u00a0 crime, and it neither can nor must influence in any way the characterization\u00a0 of the facts.\u00a0\u00a0 One who helps a son kill his father is an accomplice of parricide:\u00a0 one who plans with a servant to commit a theft (<em>hurto<\/em>), and does commit it, is guilty of <em>hurto domestico.<\/em> When the\u00a0 law clearly defines\u00a0 a crime, as it has here defined the crime of malversation, those who in any\u00a0 way participate therein must be principals,\u00a0 accomplices or abettors thereof.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Vol. 4,\u00a0 p. 275.)<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Viada, in his\u00a0 Commentaries upon the same article, says:<\/p><blockquote><p><em>\"Shall the person who participates or intervenes as coperpetrator,\u00a0 accomplice or abettor in the crime of malversation of public funds, committed by a public officer, have the penalties of this article also imposed\u00a0 upon him? <\/em> In Opposition to the opinion maintained by some jurists\u00a0 and commentators (among others\u00a0 the learned Pacheco) we\u00a0 can only answer the question affirmatively, for the same reasons (<em>mutatis mutandis<\/em>) we have already advanced in\u00a0 Question I of the commentary\u00a0 on article 314.\u00a0\u00a0 French jurisprudence has also settled the question in the same way on the ground that the person guilty of the crime <em>necessarily aids<\/em> the other culprit\u00a0 <em>in\u00a0 the acts which constitute\u00a0 the,\u00a0 crime.<\/em>\"\u00a0 (Vol. 2, 4th edition, p. 653.)<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The reasoning by which Groizard and Viada support their views as to the\u00a0 correct interpretation of the\u00a0 provisions of the Penal\u00a0 Code\u00a0 touching malversation of public funds by a public official,\u00a0 is equally applicable in our opinion, to the provisions of Act\u00a0 No. 1740 defining and penalizing that crime, and we have heretofore, in the case of the United States <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs. <\/span>Dowdell (11 Phil.

On the day on which the preliminary investigation was held, which was sixteen\u00a0 days after the accused\u00a0 Chinamen were arrested and the opium was delivered\u00a0 into the possession of the appellant, the internal-revenue officer claimed to have discovered that the opium, deposited\u00a0 with the appellant as acting justice\u00a0 of the peace\u00a0 on the arrest of the accused Chinamen, had disappeared and in its\u00a0 place had been substituted\u00a0 123\u00a0 grams of\u00a0 honey\u00a0 or black sugar.\u00a0\u00a0 Thereupon an information was filed charging the appellant with the crime of malversation of public property under Act No. 1740.<br\/><br\/>The attorney for the people discusses the question whether or not\u00a0 the\u00a0 accused is guilty of\u00a0 malversation of\u00a0 public property under the\u00a0 act\u00a0 referred to or whether he is guilty of <i>estafa <\/i>under subdivision 5 of article 535 of the Penal Code, concluding that\u00a0 he is guilty\u00a0 of <i>estafa<\/i>\u00a0 and\u00a0 not of malversation.<br\/><br\/>We find it unnecessary to discuss this question for the reason that upon the facts we are\u00a0 satisfied that the appellant has\u00a0 not\u00a0 been proved guilty\u00a0 of any crime\u00a0 beyond a\u00a0 reasonable doubt.\u00a0 No sufficient or\u00a0 satisfactory proof was made of the character or constituency of the 123 grams of substance which was found substituted\u00a0 in\u00a0 place of the opium sixteen days after its\u00a0 deposit\u00a0 with the appellant, admitting that there was a substitution.\u00a0\u00a0 There is no satisfactory proof\u00a0 that the\u00a0 substance was not\u00a0 the\u00a0 same substance that\u00a0 had\u00a0 been\u00a0 delivered\u00a0 to the\u00a0 appellant.\u00a0\u00a0 This means that there is no satisfactory proof that there was a substitution.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 difference in weight may easily be accounted for by evaporation of the liquid\u00a0 or other causes, it appearing\u00a0 from the proofs that the receptacle in which the substance was at the time of its delivery to the appellant was open and\u00a0 without covering of any\u00a0 kind.\u00a0\u00a0 The proofs as to the actual composition of the substance in controversy are\u00a0 scanty,\u00a0 indefinite\u00a0 and altogether unsatisfactory.\u00a0 It appears from the record that an expert pharmacist, testifying as a witness for the defendant, asserted that the substance which the prosecution alleges was\u00a0 either\u00a0 honey\u00a0 or black sugar did not contain either of those substances.\u00a0 We do not believe that the proofs fairly sustain the judgment of conviction.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of conviction is reversed and the discharge of the\u00a0 accused from custody ordered forthwith.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Guillermo Crisostomo and Isabel Angeles also appeared and opposed\u00a0 the petition on\u00a0 the\u00a0 ground that they\u00a0 were the owners of certain portions of the land sought to be inscribed. Judgment was rendered in the court below supporting the opposition of Crisostomo and Angeles as to the portions of the lands described in their\u00a0 respective oppositions.\u00a0 The opposition of the Government was overruled and judgment was entered in favor of the petitioner\u00a0 as to all of the land except that as\u00a0 to\u00a0 which the\u00a0 said\u00a0 two oppositions\u00a0 were sustained.\u00a0 From the decree of the\u00a0 court sustaining these two oppositions\u00a0 the petitioner alone appealed.\u00a0 The only questions to be resolved relate to this appeal.<\/p><p>The important part of the judgment appealed\u00a0 from is the following:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"Therefore, the possession given to\u00a0 Revilla of the lands situated\u00a0 in Umanat and Tumana, respectively, was wholly unauthorized and illegal.\u00a0 Hence, he has not enjoyed the same\u00a0 continuously and peacefully, at least with reference to Jhe lands in Umanat, in regard to which he was compelled to institute an action for the recovery of the same against one Guillermo Crisostomo.\u00a0\u00a0 Even assuming that such possession was continuous and peaceful since the year 1887, when\u00a0 the land was\u00a0 awarded to him,\u00a0 his claim could not be established under any provision\u00a0 of\u00a0 law.\u00a0 The title which was subsequently issued in December,\u00a0 1889, for the above mentioned lands was completely invalid.\u00a0 The grant io him being gratuitous, as it were, must\u00a0 have been necessarily made upon one\u00a0 of these two grounds, to wit:\u00a0 an\u00a0 uninterrupted possession for ten years with\u00a0 just title in good faith (sec. 4, regulations of June 25, 1880) ; or, if such a title was lacking,\u00a0 possession\u00a0 for a period of twenty years provided the lands were under cultivation, and of thirty years if. the lands\u00a0 were uncultivated.\u00a0\u00a0 (Sec. 5 of the same regulations.) Neither\u00a0 of these two conditions\u00a0 obtained at the time the title, through an error or flaw, was\u00a0 granted,\u00a0 and secondly, because,\u00a0 considering the date on which the title was issued and the\u00a0 date\u00a0 upon which the grantee took\u00a0 possession, it could\u00a0 not have had\u00a0 effect with regard\u00a0 to Eulogio Revilla. The lands situated\u00a0 in\u00a0 Umanat were held and occupied\u00a0 by Crisostomo\u00a0 and\u00a0 Angeles,\u00a0 according to the\u00a0 evidence\u00a0 of record.<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The three parcels\u00a0 of land sought\u00a0 to\u00a0 be inscribed are, according to the petition,\u00a0 situated in\u00a0 Calumpang, Umanat, and Tumana, barrio of San Marcos, municipality of Calumpit, Province of Bulacan, and are respectively described as follows:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"<em>Parcel A<\/em>. - Bounded on the north\u00a0 by the lands of Pantaleon de los Santos, Pedro Flores, Honorata Bayan, Juan de los Reyes, and Eugenio Sufiga; on the east by the lands of Leon\u00a0 Rueda; on\u00a0 the west by the lands of Guillermo Crisostomo;\u00a0 and on\u00a0 the south by the lands of Generoso Tiongson; containing 221,115 square meters (22\u00a0 hectares 11 ares 15 centares).\u00a0 <\/p><p><em>\"Parcel B. <\/em>- .Bounded on the north by the lands of Donato Bayan, Faustina Torres, Antonio de Leon, Benito Espiritu, Pablo Bundoc, Felipe\u00a0 de\u00a0 Leon,\u00a0 Felipe Balares, and Luis Sinkak; on the east by the lands of Guillermo Crisostomo; on the south by the lands\u00a0 of the Insular Government; and on the west\u00a0 by the lands of Guillermo Crisostomo,\u00a0 Felix Bautista, Sabino Manio, Pedro\u00a0 Flores, and Fruto Rojas: containing\u00a0 194,747 square meters\u00a0 (19 hectares\u00a0 47 ares\u00a0 47 centares).\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"<em>Parcel C<\/em>. - Bounded on the north by the Quingua River; on the east by\u00a0 the lands\u00a0 of Antonio de Leon and Luis Sinkak; on the south\u00a0 by the lands of Luis Sinkak, Tomas Lacsamana and Donato Bayan; and on the west by the lands of Antonio Tiongson; containing 52,852 square meters\u00a0 (5 hectares 28 ares 52 centares).\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Guillermo Crisostomo opposed\u00a0 the registration of parcels A and B\u00a0 on the ground that there was included in parcel A 2\u00a0 hectares\u00a0 66 ares and 40 centares, and in parcel B 8 hectares\u00a0 55 ares and 5 centares, of his lands.\u00a0\u00a0 Isabel Angeles opposed\u00a0 the registration of the same two\u00a0 parcels on the ground that there was included in parcel A 4 hectares 87 ares and 59\u00a0 centares of her\u00a0 property, and\u00a0 that all\u00a0 of parcel B except that part claimed by Guillermo Cris6stomo was her land.<\/p><p>The petitioner's title to these lands is based upon a purchase made by her\u00a0 from Eumelia\u00a0 Eleizegui and Salud Revilla, as appears from a public document duly executed on the 2d\u00a0 of November, 1907, and\u00a0 inscribed in the registry of property, Eumelia Eleizegui acting for\u00a0 herself and as guardian of the minors Eulogio, Manuel, Pilar,\u00a0 and Jose, surnamed\u00a0 Revilla.\u00a0\u00a0 These\u00a0 vendors are\u00a0 the widow\u00a0 and children of\u00a0 the deceased Eulogio Revilla,\u00a0 husband of Eleizegui and father of the other vendors.<\/p><p>Sometime prior to the year 1880, Jose Perez Rubio filed in the Court of First Instance, Quiapo, Manila, a civil suit against\u00a0 Gregorio Rivera and\u00a0 Maria Soledad Cruz for the purpose of recovering certain fees for professional services. Subsequently thereto judgment was entered and\u00a0 execution issued against the defendants.\u00a0 By\u00a0 virtue of this execution the lands of the defendants situated\u00a0 in Calumpit were levied upon, and\u00a0 on the 23d\u00a0 of\u00a0 February,\u00a0 1880,\u00a0 sold\u00a0 at\u00a0 public auction.\u00a0 On the 13th\u00a0 of November\u00a0 of\u00a0 that\u00a0 same\u00a0 year, Rubio by means of a public document executed by the clerk of the court, sold all his right, title, and interest\u00a0 in and to such lands to\u00a0 Eulogio Revilla for the\u00a0 sum of 2,000\u00a0 pesos. This sale was approved\u00a0 by\u00a0 the court.\u00a0\u00a0 On the 12th of February, 1887, the purchaser,\u00a0 Revilla, was placed in possession of one parcel of land.\u00a0\u00a0 Revilla,\u00a0 believing that\u00a0 he had not been placed\u00a0 in possession of all the lands purchased by him from Rubio, made application to the court to be\u00a0 placed in possession\u00a0 of\u00a0 two other parcels which he claimed\u00a0 were included in\u00a0 the execution sale and\u00a0 the purchase made by him.\u00a0 The\u00a0 appellant now insists that\u00a0 Revilla was, on the 18th\u00a0 of March,\u00a0 1887,\u00a0 placed\u00a0 in possession\u00a0 of these\u00a0 two parcels by order of the court, and that the document of this purchase and sale, including the three\u00a0 parcels of land, was duly executed\u00a0 by\u00a0 order\u00a0 of\u00a0 the court on the 12th of\u00a0 April, 1889.<\/p><p>The appellees insist that the possession of the two parcels of land, one in Umanat\u00a0 and the other in Tumana, given to Revilla by the Court of First Instance of Quiapo was\u00a0 illegal and void, for the reason that the said lands in Umanat and Tumana were not included in the execution sale of February 23, 1880, as\u00a0 shown by the\u00a0 description of the lands then levied upon; and that the lands in the order of execution issued by the Court of First Instance of Quiapo are described as follows:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"Certain lands which they (the judgment debtors) possess in the jurisdiction of Calumpit, bounded on the north by the lands of Lorenzo de los Reyes; on the south by the lands of the town of Barosuain; on the east by the lands of Jose Tiongson; and on the west by the lands of Guillermo Crisostomo; containing three quinones, more or less.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The appellees further insist that the lands described in their respective\u00a0 oppositions have been adjudged to be their property by a court of competent jurisdiction, and that the said judgments have long since become final.<\/p><p>Eulogio Revilla obtained on the 4th of December, 1889, a State grant for the three parcels of land described in the petition.\u00a0 The ownership\u00a0 of this land was adjudged to him on that date by\u00a0 the State and the title ordered registered. The registrar, on the 12th of September, 1892, made the following entry\u00a0 in the property\u00a0 register:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"The foregoing instrument was provisionally recorded in the absence of the old indices, at pages 241, 244, and 246, volume 1, of\u00a0 the Calumpit District,\u00a0 Properties Nos.\u00a0 105, 106,107, entry letter A, Bulacan, September 12,1892.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The final registration was made November 2, 1908.<\/p><p>The opponents lay no\u00a0 claim\u00a0 to that parcel\u00a0 of land described in paragraph C of\u00a0 the petition, neither do they claim to be the owners\u00a0 of all of parcel A, as it will be seen that this parcel contains\u00a0 22 hectares\u00a0 11\u00a0 ares\u00a0 and 15 centares, according to the petition, whereas the appellees together claim only 7 hectares\u00a0 53\u00a0 ares and\u00a0 99\u00a0 centares.\u00a0 This leaves undisputed 14 hectares 57 ares and 16 centares of that parcel. It is insisted that a portion of parcel A was the only\u00a0 land included in\u00a0 the\u00a0 order of\u00a0 execution issued in 1880.\u00a0 This contention is based upon the description of the land given in that order and its actual area, which appears to be three quinones, more or less.\u00a0 Notwithstanding the fact that it is stated that this parcel contains three quinones,\u00a0 more or less,\u00a0 it appears from the\u00a0 boundaries given that all of the land\u00a0 in that parcel was\u00a0 included.\u00a0 The\u00a0 statement \"containing three quinones, more or less\" is a mere estimate and it was\u00a0 not intended to be accurate.\u00a0 While it is true that parcel A was the only description in the order of execution, it is\u00a0 nevertheless\u00a0 a fact that all\u00a0 of the lands\u00a0 owned by the judgment debtors\u00a0 in that case were\u00a0 levied upon\u00a0 and the sale went forward on this theory.\u00a0 The judgment\u00a0 creditor purchased all of the lands owned by his judgment debtors within the jurisdiction\u00a0 of that\u00a0 barrio at this execution sale, and he\u00a0 transferred to Revilla all of the\u00a0 lands\u00a0 thus\u00a0 purchased;\u00a0 but when the authorities proceeded to put Revilla in possession of the lands purchased by him and placed him in possession of the one parcel only, he immediately made application to the\u00a0 court for the possession of the other two parcels,\u00a0 and upon this application\u00a0 he was given\u00a0 judicial possession\u00a0 of the said two parcels, one in Umanat\u00a0 and the other in Tumana.\u00a0\u00a0 This fact was\u00a0 found by the trial\u00a0 court.<\/p><p>The appellee Crisostomo presented Exhibit\u00a0 No. 1, which is a copy of a judgment rendered in\u00a0 the case wherein\u00a0 he was plaintiff and\u00a0 Antero Coronel and Maria\u00a0 Soledad Cruz were\u00a0 defendants.\u00a0\u00a0 In\u00a0 this case\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiff\u00a0 sought\u00a0 to recover possession of two parcels\u00a0 of iand.\u00a0\u00a0 This action was commenced in\u00a0 1878, judgment was rendered in favor\u00a0 of the plaintiff in 1892, and this judgment was executed in the same\u00a0 year over the opposition of Revilla.\u00a0 The\u00a0 execution of this judgment\u00a0 which resulted\u00a0 in\u00a0 temporarily\u00a0 placing Crisostomo in possession of these two parcels took place long after the State grant had been issued to Revilla and long after Revilla\u00a0 had been judicially placed in possession of these lands.\u00a0\u00a0 Revilla was not a party plaintiff or\u00a0 defendant in that case,\u00a0 nor in any\u00a0 other case upon\u00a0 which the appellees rely.\u00a0\u00a0 Consequently,\u00a0 the judgments rendered\u00a0 in those\u00a0 cases could not be binding upon Revilla.<\/p><p>With reference to who was actually in possession of these two\u00a0 parcels of land prior\u00a0 to the insurrection against the American authorities, it might be well to examine the oral testimony also.<\/p><p>The first witness presented by the petitioner was Francisco Mavia, 40 years of age, resident of Malolos, Bulacan. This witness testified that he knew the deceased, Eulogio Revilla; that before his death the deceased was in possession of three parcels of land within the jurisdiction of the town of Calumpit; that one of these parcels is in Tumana, one in Calumpang, and one in Umanat; that he was the encargado or administrator of these lands\u00a0 for Revilla from 1891 up until the commencement of the revolution; that every year during his administration, all of these three parcels of land were cultivated; that during the revolution Guillermo Crisostomo took possession\u00a0 of one parcel\u00a0 and a man\u00a0 called Ninoy took possession of another one.\u00a0\u00a0 This witness then proceeded to\u00a0 give\u00a0 the names of the\u00a0 owners of\u00a0 the land adjoining these three parcels at that time.<\/p><p>The second witness presented was Juan Borja,\u00a0 70 years of age and a resident of Calumpit.\u00a0 This witness stated that he was well acquainted with the deceased Revilla; that he (Revilla) was\u00a0 in\u00a0 possession\u00a0 for\u00a0 a number of\u00a0 years of three parcels of land situated in\u00a0 Calumpang, Umanat, and Tumana; that\u00a0 Revilla and the parties from\u00a0 whom he acquired these lands were in possession of the same since 1887; that he knew this to be a fact because he was one of the laborers of the deceased and\u00a0 assisted in cultivating these lands; that he\u00a0 was present and\u00a0 pointed out\u00a0 to the commissioner\u00a0 Vicente Enriquez, clerk of the court, the location\u00a0 and boundaries of these three parcels\u00a0 when this commissioner\u00a0 placed Revilla in possession of all\u00a0 three parcels;\u00a0 that Revilla\u00a0 continued in possession of the same until his death, after which his wife and daughter remained in possession up to the time of the\u00a0 revolution, when they were\u00a0 dispossessed of a portion of these lands; that he accompanied the surveyor when said\u00a0 lands were surveyed. This witness also gave the boundaries at that time.<\/p><p>The third witness called was Donato Bayan, who testified that the deceased Revilla was in\u00a0 possession of the three parcels of land in question from 1891 and 1892 up to the time\u00a0 of his death;\u00a0 that during all\u00a0 these years Revilla cultivated the three parcels; that he had personal knowledge of these facts because he, in 1891, owned lands joining one of these parcels.<\/p><p>The fourth witness for the petitioner was Emeterio Manlapit, 47 years of age, a laborer, and resident of Calumpit, who testified that he knew the deceased Revilla; that the deceased owned and possessed three parcels of land situated in Umanat, Calumpang, and Tumana; that during the ten years in which the\u00a0 deceased possessed these lands he was one of the laborers who cultivated the same for the deceased; that the latter was\u00a0 never interrupted in the possession of said lands during that time; that upon the death of Revilla, his wife\u00a0 and\u00a0 daughter continued\u00a0 in the\u00a0 possession and cultivation of these\u00a0 parcels of land;\u00a0 that some time after the deceased died a man by the name of Ninoy\u00a0 (Saturnino Letingco), against the will of the widow, took possession of a part of these lands.<\/p><p>The appellee Guillermo\u00a0 Crisostomo,\u00a0 74 years of\u00a0 age, laborer, resident of Malolos,\u00a0 testifying as witness in his own behalf, pointed out on the plan the two parcels\u00a0 in Umanat and Calumpang and stated that these two parcels were his property, he having acquired a part of the same by purchase and the other part by inheritance from\u00a0 his parents, Jorge Crisostomo and Gervasia Dimaliuat;\u00a0 that he had had five lawsuits over these two parcels; that during the proceedings which\u00a0 resulted in the issuance of a grant by the State to Revilla, he signed the\u00a0 expediente as owning land on\u00a0 the south of those parcels for which title was sought; that his sister Escolastica Cris6stomo did not sign this\u00a0 expediente for the reason that she was\u00a0 single and consulted him about all her acts.<\/p><p>The next witness presented for the opposition was Saturnino Litingco,\u00a0 husband of the\u00a0 appellee,\u00a0 Isabel Angelo, 66 years of age, resident of the barrio of San Vicente, Malolos, Bulacan.\u00a0 After pointing out on the plan the lands claimed by his\u00a0 wife, he stated that these lands were inherited by his wife from her father, Hermogenes Angelo; that he and his wife have been for more than thirty years and are now in possession of these lands; that his father-in-law had a lawsuit with Maria Soledad over the possession and title to these two small parcels in 1878, and that\u00a0 the court in that suit,\u00a0 by a final judgment, decreed possession and title to his father-in-law; that after the death of his father-in-law, they had another suit over the same lands with Maria Soledad with the same result; that since the termination of\u00a0 these suits they have had quiet and peaceful possession of\u00a0 these lands without interruption; that it is true that he and\u00a0 his wife sold certain lands inherited by his wife from her father, located in Umanat, to Felix Bautista and Fruto Roxas.<\/p><p>The\u00a0 foregoing testimony considered\u00a0 together\u00a0 with the documentary evidence, establishes the fact that the deceased Revilla was in continuous possession of all\u00a0 the three parcels of land sought to be inscribed\u00a0 for some time prior to the issuance of the State\u00a0 grant and\u00a0 up to the time of his death. This testimony also establishes the fact that after the death of Revilla, his widow\u00a0 and children continued in the peaceful possession of these\u00a0 three\u00a0 parcels\u00a0 of land up until\u00a0 they were dispossessed by the\u00a0 appellees,\u00a0 sometime\u00a0 during the insurrection.<\/p><p>Whether or not a State grant of the character of the one issued to Revilla can be annulled at the instance of\u00a0 a private person,\u00a0 we find it\u00a0 unnecessary\u00a0 to decide;\u00a0 but before this can be done, if it can be done at all, the testimony of the person seeking such relief, before it can\u00a0 overcome the acts of the officials who carried on the proceedings which resulted in the issuance of the State grant, must be clear, positive, and conclusive.\u00a0 The testimony of the appellees in\u00a0 this case falls far short of these requirements.<\/p><p>We concluded that the trial\u00a0 court erred in its findings of fact\u00a0 and conclusions of law and we therefore ordered the judgment\u00a0 rendered\u00a0 in accordance\u00a0 with\u00a0 the above\u00a0 short decision.<\/p><p><em> Arellano, C.

JACINTA MATA ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br\/>\n<br\/>\nD E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>CARSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">The evidence\u00a0 of record conclusively establishes the performance of the ceremony of marriage between the defendant, Jacinta Mata, and\u00a0 the complaining\u00a0 witness,\u00a0 Marcial Tanedo Tiu Chiu, and leaves no\u00a0 room\u00a0 for doubt of the existence of the alleged carnal relations between this woman and the codefendant, Quiterio Sarmiento.\u00a0 The\u00a0 judgment of the trial court convicting them of the crime of adultery must, therefore, be affirmed, unless it be held, as contended by counsel for the defendants, that the evidence also shows that the\u00a0 marriage\u00a0 between the complaining witness and Jacinta Mata\u00a0 was bigamous, and that\u00a0 in view of this\u00a0 fact, the carnal relations between the defendants should not be adjudged to have constituted\u00a0 the crime of adultery.<br\/><br\/>There is evidence in the\u00a0 record which undoubtedly tends very\u00a0 strongly\u00a0 to establish\u00a0 the contention of\u00a0 counsel for defendants\u00a0 that\u00a0 at the time when the complaining\u00a0 witness married the defendant,\u00a0 Jacinta Mata, he had\u00a0 a wife in China; but we do not deem it necessary to make an\u00a0 express finding in\u00a0 this regard,\u00a0 because we are of opinion that\u00a0 in the absence of proof of a formal judicial decree declaring the nullity of\u00a0 the\u00a0 second alleged bigamous marriage the acts complained of constitute the\u00a0 crime of adultery.<br\/><br\/>Article 433 of the Penal Code, defining\u00a0 and penalizing the crime of adultery, is as\u00a0 follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Adultery\u00a0 shall be punished with the penalty of <i>prision correccional<\/i> in its medium and maximum degrees.<br\/><br\/>\"Adultery\u00a0 is committed by the married woman who lies with\u00a0 a man\u00a0 not\u00a0 her husband, and by\u00a0 him who lies with her knowing that she\u00a0 is married,\u00a0 although the marriage be afterwards\u00a0 declared void.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It is quite clear\u00a0 from the peculiar phrasing of the last paragraph of this article, that the lawmakers intended\u00a0 to declare adulterous\u00a0 the\u00a0 infidelity of a married woman\u00a0 to her marital vows, even though it should be made to appear that she is entitled to have\u00a0 her marriage contract declared null and void, until and\u00a0 unless she actually secures a formal judicial declaration to that effect.\u00a0 The reason for this provision is thus stated by Groizard, in his commentary upon similar provisions contained in\u00a0 article 488 of the Spanish Penal\u00a0 Code of 1870:<br\/><blockquote>\"At no time does the bond of matrimony contain a defect which by itself is sufficient to dissolve the\u00a0 union.\u00a0 The marriage must be\u00a0 declared to\u00a0 be\u00a0 null\u00a0 in order that the bond\u00a0 may\u00a0 be severed.\u00a0 \"Until\u00a0 it is so declared, until by competent authority in\u00a0 a final judgment the marriage contract\u00a0 is\u00a0 set aside, the offense to the vows taken, and the attack on\u00a0 the family\u00a0 exists - the adultery reunites the essential conditions\u00a0 required for\u00a0 its\u00a0 punishment.\u00a0 This abundantly satisfies the reason and furthermore is expressly set out in our statute.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Counsel for appellants contends that the provision under consideration is intended merely to\u00a0 declare that, notwithstanding the fact that\u00a0 the\u00a0 marriage is subsequently annulled\u00a0 because of the adulterous conduct of\u00a0 the woman, nevertheless the penalty prescribed by the code is to be imposed\u00a0 and enforced.\u00a0 But the language\u00a0 of the article itself does not justify such a\u00a0 restricted construction, and an examination of the earlier provisions of the Spanish laws upon this subject, from\u00a0 which this article was\u00a0 undoubtedly drawn, disposes of the idea that such could have been the intention of the Spanish lawmaker.\u00a0\u00a0 Law 81 of Toro, which is law 4,\u00a0 title 28, book\u00a0 12 of the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Novisima Recopilacion, <\/span>prescribed that it will not serve as an\u00a0 excuse to the adulterers\u00a0 to\u00a0 allege\u00a0 and prove \"by divers reasons that the marriage\u00a0 was null on the grounds that the contracting parties were relatives by\u00a0 blood or affinity\u00a0 within the fourth degree,\u00a0 or that either of them\u00a0 was bound by a former\u00a0 marriage,\u00a0 or has taken the vows of chastity, religous vows, or for\u00a0 any\u00a0 other reason whatever, as they ought not to have done that which they had no right to do.\"<br\/><br\/>In the discussion of this case among the members of the court, the question arose\u00a0 whether\u00a0 the provision of\u00a0 article 433\u00a0 under consideration\u00a0 may\u00a0 not\u00a0 have been modified\u00a0 or abrogated by\u00a0 necessary implication by the publication\u00a0 of General Orders, No. 68, December,\u00a0 1899, whereby \"certain provisions respecting marriage\" were\u00a0 put in\u00a0 force by\u00a0 the command of the Military Governor during the period\u00a0 of the military occupation of these Islands by the American military forces.<br\/><br\/>Section III of that Order is\u00a0 as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"A subsequent marriage contracted by any person during the life\u00a0 of a former husband or wife of such\u00a0 person, with any person other than the\u00a0 former husband or wife, is illegal and void from the beginning, unless\u00a0 -<br\/><br\/>\"(1)\u00a0 The former\u00a0 marriage\u00a0 has been\u00a0 annulled or dissolved.<br\/><br\/>\"(2)\u00a0 Unless such former husband or wife was absent, and\u00a0 not known to\u00a0 such person to\u00a0 be living for the space of seven successive years immediately preceding such\u00a0 subsequent marriage, or\u00a0 was generally reputed and was believed by such\u00a0 person to be dead at the time such\u00a0 subsequent marriage was contracted; in either of which cases the\u00a0 subsequent marriage is\u00a0 valid\u00a0 until\u00a0 its\u00a0 nullity\u00a0 is adjudged by a competent tribunal.\"<\/blockquote>Keeping in mind the conditions under which this order was published,\u00a0 and the objects which were\u00a0 sought to\u00a0 be obtained by\u00a0 its provisions, we are of opinion that it was not intended to have the effect,\u00a0 and that it\u00a0 did not have the effect of abrogating those just and humane provisions of the Spanish law which secure to the\u00a0 innocent\u00a0 party to a\u00a0 bigamous\u00a0 marriage certain\u00a0 rights in the communal property\u00a0 acquired\u00a0 during the existence\u00a0 of the\u00a0 bigamous relations, and which legitimate the offspring of such unions and recognize the\u00a0 right of inheritance\u00a0 of such offspring from the offending spouse.\u00a0 The bigamous\u00a0 marriage,\u00a0 as a marriage,\u00a0 is\u00a0 declared to be illegal and void\u00a0 from the beginning, but this provision is not necessarily in conflict with those statutory provisions\u00a0 of the Spanish law which prescribe the status of the children resulting from the bigamous\u00a0 relations\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 party,\u00a0 or the rights of property arising, not as a result of the bigamous marriage but of the communal relations existing thereafter between the parties.<br\/><br\/>The gist of the crime of adultery under the Spanish law, as under the common\u00a0 law in\u00a0 force\u00a0 in\u00a0 England\u00a0 and the United States in the absence of\u00a0 statutory enactments,\u00a0 is the danger of introducing spurious heirs into the family, whereby the\u00a0 rights of the real heirs may be impaired and a man may be charged with the maintenance of a family not his own. And\u00a0 since, under\u00a0 Spanish law, legitimate heirs may be begotten of a bigamous marriage, the danger of the introduction\u00a0 of\u00a0 spurious heirs is not less\u00a0 real as a result of the infidelity of the wife of a bigamous marriage than it is in\u00a0 the case of\u00a0 a lawful wife;\u00a0 logically, therefore, the incontinence of the wife of a bigamous marriage, as long as the bigamous relations exist, was\u00a0 deemed by the Spanish legislator to constitute the crime of adultery, and penalized in like manner as\u00a0 is the\u00a0 marital faithlessness of a lawful wife.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 fact that the law is otherwise\u00a0 in those jurisdictions where legislation has been largely\u00a0 influenced by the doctrines and principles of the common\u00a0 law of England is a natural\u00a0 consequence of the failure of that system of jurisprudence to recognize the existence of heritable blood of the father in\u00a0 the fruits of a bigamous marriage.\u00a0\u00a0 But it would seem in those States where such children are, by-statute, legitimized, a\u00a0 consistent system of penal legislation would\u00a0 demand the penalization of the incontinence of the wife of a bigamous marriage equally with that of a lawful\u00a0 wife.\u00a0 Certainly, in this jurisdiction, a statute declaring bigamous marriages illegal and void from the beginning ought\u00a0 not to\u00a0 be held to\u00a0 repeal by necessary\u00a0 implication the provisions of the\u00a0 Penal Code penalizing as adulterous the incontinence of the wife of a bigamous marriage unless it be held further\u00a0 to\u00a0 repeal by necessary implication the statutes legitimizing the offspring of bigamous\u00a0 marriages; and as we have said no such effect\u00a0 can or should be given to the\u00a0 General Order under consideration.<br\/><br\/>We conclude, therefore,\u00a0 that the\u00a0 provisions\u00a0 of the\u00a0 code penalizing as adultery the infidelity of the wife of a bigamous marriage continue in full force and effect.<br\/><br\/>We find no error in the\u00a0 proceedings of the court below prejudicial to the rights of the appellants, and the judgment convicting them\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 crime\u00a0 of\u00a0 adultery and\u00a0 the sentence imposed upon\u00a0 them by the trial court should therefore be affirmed.<br\/><br\/><i> Arellano, C.

It\u00a0 should\u00a0 be observed\u00a0 (<i>a<\/i>) that\u00a0 the crime is alleged\u00a0 to have been committed\u00a0 on Sunday and in the middle\u00a0 of the day;\u00a0 (<i>b<\/i>)\u00a0 that the accused is alleged\u00a0 to have attempted the violation of the complainant in the presence of a little boy seven years of age; (<i>c<\/i>)\u00a0 that the\u00a0 house wherein the assault is alleged to have been made is situated in a locality where there were other habitations, being only about forty yards from the house of Sotera Baltazar, who, it is alleged, came instantly\u00a0 at the call of the complainant;\u00a0 (<i>d<\/i>)\u00a0 that the father and a companion were fishing within forty yards of the\u00a0 house\u00a0 at the\u00a0 time\u00a0 and that,\u00a0 it\u00a0 is asserted by the prosecution, there were a\u00a0 number\u00a0 of other people in close proximity; that they\u00a0 were attracted\u00a0 by the cries of the child and not\u00a0 of the complainant.<br\/><br\/>It should be\u00a0 particularly noted\u00a0 <i>(e)<\/i>\u00a0 that although\u00a0 it is alleged\u00a0 that\u00a0 two disinterested\u00a0 witnesses,\u00a0 namely, Sotera Baltazar and Ponciano Mallari, saw the accused\u00a0 leap from the house\u00a0 and flee, they have not been presented as witnesses for the prosecution; and that the little boy, although presented by the prosecution\u00a0 as\u00a0 a witness\u00a0 against the accused,\u00a0 was not\u00a0 permitted\u00a0 to\u00a0 testify for the reason that, in the judgment of the court, he did not display sufficient intelligence to make him a competent\u00a0 witness.<br\/><br\/>It thus appears that the only evidence against the accused is that produced by\u00a0 the complainant and her father. While\u00a0 evidence\u00a0 of this character would\u00a0 generally be sufficient, everything else being equal, nevertheless,\u00a0 under the circumstances of this particular case, we do not regard the case made by it as satisfactory.\u00a0\u00a0 The failure of the prosecution to\u00a0 present the two disinterested witnesses above- mentioned\u00a0 seriously\u00a0 weakens its\u00a0 case\u00a0 against the accused. The prosecution\u00a0 asserts that it caused subpoenas to be issued for the witnesses in\u00a0 question and\u00a0 that\u00a0 they could not be found.\u00a0 There are found in the record simply two subpoenas, one directed to\u00a0 Ponciano\u00a0 Mallari,\u00a0 dated\u00a0 August 10,\u00a0 1909, and\u00a0 another\u00a0 to\u00a0 Sotera\u00a0 Baltazar,\u00a0 date\u00a0 the\u00a0 16th of\u00a0 the same month and year.\u00a0 The trial began on the <i>fifth day of March preceding, at which time the prosecution\u00a0 put in its proofs and closed its case without ever having\u00a0 issued a subpoena for the two witnesses referred to. <\/i>\u00a0 Nothing more seems to have been\u00a0 done with the case until the\u00a0 20th of August, 1909,\u00a0 when the accused began his defence.\u00a0 It was just prior to this date that the two subpoenas above-mentioned were issued.\u00a0 As\u00a0 to these, the\u00a0 record does not disclose when they were delivered to the sheriff for service or what effort, if any, he\u00a0 made to find the witnesses; nor does\u00a0 it appear that\u00a0 other or further\u00a0 effort\u00a0 was\u00a0 made\u00a0 at any time.<br\/><br\/>We do not believe the evidence\u00a0 warrants the conviction of the accused.\u00a0\u00a0 (U.

The defendant was the chief\u00a0 clerk in\u00a0 the quartermaster's office in Iloilo, to whom was intrusted the combination\u00a0 and the key to the quartermaster's safe.\u00a0 He did not, however, have charge of the cash book, which was kept by another clerk in\u00a0 the office; nor\u00a0 did he have authority to open the safe or to withdraw funds therefrom except at the direction of his superior officer, the quartermaster, who was in charge of the safe and\u00a0 its contents, and under whose\u00a0 immediate control it was.\u00a0 The only duty of the defendant in regard to the safe and its contents was to keep safely the combination and the key, and to open and\u00a0 close it at the direction of his superior officer, the quartermaster in charge of the\u00a0 office;\u00a0 he\u00a0 had no\u00a0 control whatever over the contents of the safe and\u00a0 was not charged with\u00a0 the withdrawal or distribution of the funds, checks and other property which were kept in\u00a0 it.<\/p><p>During the absence of his superior officer and while in a state of intoxication, defendant opened the safe\u00a0 and\u00a0 abstracted therefrom the\u00a0 cash and checks described in\u00a0 the information.\u00a0 Before judgment of conviction in the court below, the cash and all of the checks were recovered,\u00a0 except three which were indorsed by the parties to whom the defendant sold them, and paid by the Treasurer of\u00a0 the Philippine Islands,\u00a0 upon whom they were drawn.\u00a0 The face value of these checks was\u00a0 refunded to the quarter-master, so that at the time when judgment was entered in the court below all of the stolen\u00a0 property\u00a0 or its value had been recovered.<\/p><p>Counsel for appellant, without denying that\u00a0 the\u00a0 record discloses highly reprehensible\u00a0 conduct in the abstraction of the checks and cash from the safe, and the negotiation of some of the checks, contends nevertheless that the judgment of the lower\u00a0 court\u00a0 should be reversed on various grounds.<\/p><p>Counsel insists that the trial court\u00a0 erred in refusing to declare the information fatally\u00a0 defective because, as counsel contends, it does not set out the value\u00a0 of the stolen checks. Counsel apparently does not deem the use of the sign T in the information\u00a0 a sufficient designation\u00a0 or equivalent of the term \"pesos Philippine currency,\" and he\u00a0 insists that the tabulated form\u00a0 in\u00a0 which\u00a0 the checks are described in the\u00a0 information does not affirmatively disclose that\u00a0 the checks were worth the amount for which it is alleged they were drawn.\u00a0 Counsel's contention can not be sustained. The sign or character V is generally accepted in these Islands as the equivalent of the words peso or pesos Philippine currency; by Executive Order\u00a0 No. 44 dated Manila, October 29, 1904, this character was made the official \"designation for the new\u00a0 Philippine\u00a0 pesos,\" and since that date its use for that purpose has become uniform and universal. We think that the allegation that the defendant stole\u00a0 the checks described in\u00a0 the tabulated statement set out in\u00a0 the information, and the sum of Pl78.08 in cash \"which amount in all to the sum of P3,041.56 pesos Filipinos,\" is a sufficiently definite allegation of the value of the stolen property; and that it is so clear and explicit as \"to leave no room for doubt in the mind of any person of even rudimentary intelligence\" that it meant to charge the defendant with the theft of the sum of money therein mentioned and of the checks therein described, the total value of which was the sum therein indicated, the value of each separate check being the amount for which\u00a0 it was\u00a0 drawn as set out in the tabulated statement.\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"The bill of rights for the Philippines, giving the accused the right to demand the nature and cause of the accusation against him does not fasten forever upon those Islands the inability of the seventeenth century common law to understand or accept\u00a0 a pleading that did not exclude every misinterpretation capable of\u00a0 occurring\u00a0 to\u00a0 intelligence\u00a0 fired with a desire to pervert.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Paraiso <em>vs<\/em>.

His relation to the contents of\u00a0 the safe\u00a0 was merely that of a guard whose duty it was to see that no one but his superior officer\u00a0 had access\u00a0 to the\u00a0 funds,\u00a0 and he had no more right of disposition of the contents of the safe than has a watchman of a warehouse\u00a0 to\u00a0 whom the key is intrusted the right to dispose of its contents.\u00a0\u00a0 In\u00a0 the\u00a0 case of U.\u00a0 S. <em>vs<\/em>. Webster\u00a0 (6 Phil. Rep., 393), the defendant was a\u00a0 forage\u00a0 master in\u00a0 charge\u00a0 of Government\u00a0 forage, subject to the orders of the quartermaster, who was directly responsible therefor to the owner, the United\u00a0 States Government, and without\u00a0 whose\u00a0 order no\u00a0 forage\u00a0 could be issued.\u00a0 The forage master had no authority to issue any orders or give out any forage except upon the requisition of the\u00a0 quartermaster, nor\u00a0 was he\u00a0 authorized to\u00a0 receive money on account of sales of this forage.\u00a0 Without such authority and without an order from the quartermaster he disposed of hay and oats to the value of some P2,015, for which he failed to account\u00a0 to the Government.\u00a0 In that case we said:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"The qualified charge of this forage, subject to the orders of a superior, who alone was responsible to the Government for it, without the right on the\u00a0 part\u00a0 of the accused to sell it or to part\u00a0 with the\u00a0 physical custody\u00a0 of it unless on written orders,\u00a0 was not such\u00a0 a\u00a0 possession as to render the abstraction\u00a0 of the property by him\u00a0 malversation\u00a0 instead of theft.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Counsel's remaining contentions may,\u00a0 for convenience, be summed up in the proposition that since, as counsel suggests, checks have\u00a0 no value in themselves, or at\u00a0 most a mere nominal value, that is, the value\u00a0 of the piece of paper on which they are written, they are not properly the subject\u00a0 of larceny; and that whatever offense is committed by one who abstracts a check, the property of another, and thereafter negotiates it,\u00a0 it\u00a0 is not theft.\u00a0\u00a0 It is contended that the offense of abstracting and negotiating\u00a0 a check may be <em>estafa<\/em>\u00a0 (embezzlement)\u00a0 or one\u00a0 of its\u00a0 kindred\u00a0 offenses, but that it is not theft.\u00a0 This was the theory of the common law under which commercial paper was not the subject of larceny,\u00a0 for the reason, as it was said, that it has no intrinsic value, and is merely an evidence or token of the\u00a0 existence of money\u00a0 or\u00a0 property\u00a0 elsewhere.\u00a0\u00a0 The common law\u00a0 rule,\u00a0 however, has been abrogated in\u00a0 most American\u00a0 jurisdictions\u00a0 by\u00a0 statutes making\u00a0 commercial papers\u00a0 the subject of larceny\u00a0 (18 Am.\u00a0 &amp;\u00a0 Eng. Ency. of Law, p. 515)\u00a0 and it is not in force in these Islands.\u00a0\u00a0 The supreme court of Spain has repeatedly\u00a0 held that checks (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">cheques<\/span>) and other commercial papers (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">valores<\/span>) are subjects of larceny.\u00a0\u00a0 Decisions of March\u00a0 16,\u00a0 1899,\u00a0 and of March 7, 1900.<\/p><p>In those States where commercial paper\u00a0 has by statute been made the\u00a0 subject of\u00a0 larceny,\u00a0 the\u00a0 statute\u00a0 generally provides that\u00a0 the face value shall \"be taken, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">prima facie,<\/span> as its\u00a0 value for\u00a0 the purpose of the statute, though this last provision is not universal.\u00a0\u00a0 In Vermont,\u00a0 commercial paper was by statute made the subject of larceny without any regulation as to its value.\u00a0 In the recently decided case of State <em>vs.<\/em> McClellan\u00a0 (23 L, R. A. (N. S.) 1063), an unendorsed check was held to be the subject of larceny, and for the purpose of\u00a0 determining the degree\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 crime\u00a0 its value was\u00a0 held\u00a0 to be its face value, or the amount for which\u00a0 it was\u00a0 drawn and which could have been realized upon it by its legal owner.<\/p><p>A check in\u00a0 the hands of\u00a0 its lawful owner is something more than a\u00a0 mere evidence or token of the existence of money\u00a0 elsewhere.\u00a0 It\u00a0 is an instrument\u00a0 which,\u00a0 from\u00a0 its peculiar qualities as a commercial document, places certain funds\u00a0 under the special control of its\u00a0 lawful holder so long as he retains it in his possession.\u00a0 It confers upon its holder exceptional and peculiar powers as to the disposition of the funds against which it is drawn,\u00a0 and enables him to realize\u00a0 those funds without regard to\u00a0 the mutual relations existing\u00a0 between himself and the drawer of the check or the depository wherein the funds are actually placed. Furthermore,\u00a0 as\u00a0 a\u00a0 result of the peculiar\u00a0 qualities\u00a0 of a check as a commercial instrument,\u00a0 the\u00a0 lawful\u00a0 holder, so long as he retains possession, has not only the right to the funds against which it is drawn, but a claim against the drawer and previous endorsers\u00a0 in the event of\u00a0 a failure of these funds in\u00a0 whole or in\u00a0 part; provided,\u00a0 however, there is due diligence on his part in asserting his claim, and in case of endorsers in protesting the\u00a0 check in\u00a0 the event of nonpayment.\u00a0 The loss of possession of\u00a0 a check deprives the owner of the immediate control of the funds against which it is drawn, and may involve the loss of the fund itself, unless he adopts prompt and efficient measures to protect\u00a0 himself; indeed if the check be made payable to bearer its\u00a0 abstraction from his possession exposes him to the\u00a0 risk of Joss of the fund without redress except only as\u00a0 against the\u00a0 guilty person.\u00a0 Manifestly these peculiar qualities which\u00a0 the law\u00a0 confers upon commercial instruments\u00a0 of this kind, and\u00a0 the exceptional incidents attaching\u00a0 to such\u00a0 instruments\u00a0 in the hands of a lawful owner, give them\u00a0 an actual substantial value in his hands which may and should be measured by the amount of cash which may be realized\u00a0 upon them, that is to say, in the case of a good and valid check, by its face value; and evidence that a check is\u00a0 a good and valid check is <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">prima facie<\/span> proof that it is worth its face value in the hands of the lawful owner. We\u00a0 are of opinion that\u00a0 a check\u00a0 is\u00a0 in a\u00a0 very real sense personal property, and that\u00a0 when abstracted with the intention of\u00a0 converting it to the\u00a0 use of the person taking it, the abstraction of the check constitutes a taking of persona] property from the possession of another, defined and penalized as the crime of hurto (theft) in the Penal Code.<\/p><p>As to unendorsed checks made payable to order, the contention that\u00a0 they are of\u00a0 no\u00a0 value seems also to be based on the theory that the value of stolen property\u00a0 is to be determined by its condition when taken; that a check payable to order is an incomplete instrument as long as it remains unendorsed;\u00a0 that no one can draw\u00a0 money on a stolen check in\u00a0 the condition in which it\u00a0 is found at the time of the theft as long\u00a0 as it remains unendorsed by the payee; and that consequently stolen checks payable to order have only\u00a0 a\u00a0 nominal\u00a0 value at the time of the theft.\u00a0 We are\u00a0 of opinion,\u00a0 however, that it\u00a0 is not\u00a0 necessary that the subject matter of a larceny should be of value to a third person if\u00a0 valuable\u00a0 to the owner, and the value of good and\u00a0 valid checks and\u00a0 similar commercial\u00a0 paper to the\u00a0 owner is, as we have seen, the amount\u00a0 which he is entitled\u00a0 to receive therefor,\u00a0 ordinarily their face value, that is to\u00a0 say the amount for which they are drawn.\u00a0\u00a0 In the case\u00a0 at bar the defendant took personal property of this character from\u00a0 the constructive possession of\u00a0 its owner with the intention\u00a0 of converting: it\u00a0 to\u00a0 his own\u00a0 use.\u00a0 The fact, admitting that it was a fact, that he could not make use\u00a0 of this property in the condition\u00a0 in\u00a0 which it was at the\u00a0 moment when\u00a0 he\u00a0 deprived the owner of it\u00a0 without indorsing it, does not and ought not to determine its value when he is called\u00a0 to account for his criminal\u00a0 act.\u00a0 The checks in the hands of\u00a0 their lawful owners were completed instruments.\u00a0 They gave their lawful owner control of the amount of currency corresponding to their face value, with the power\u00a0 of transferring that\u00a0 control by an appropriate endorsement; and\u00a0 indeed\u00a0 the lawful\u00a0 owner\u00a0 might have realized\u00a0 their substantial value\u00a0 without indorsement,\u00a0 for endorsement was not absolutely essential to the value of these checks in the hands of an honest holder.\u00a0 A formal assignment in an appropriate public instrument and perhaps a parol agreement\u00a0 with manual\u00a0 delivery would have been sufficient for that purpose: as between the assignor and assignee, such an assignment would be complete and effectual, and the holder of a check thus assigned could enforce his right therein\u00a0 by appropriate legal proceedings.\u00a0 So far,\u00a0 therefore, as the\u00a0 lawful holder of a check payable to order\u00a0 is\u00a0 concerned, its value is the same whether he has actually endorsed it, or has yet to do so before demanding payment.<\/p><p>We find\u00a0 no prejudicial error in the proceedings in the court below; the judgment of conviction and the sentence based thereon should therefore be affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<\/p><p><em>Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Moreland,<\/em> and <em>Trent, JJ.<\/em>, concur.<\/p><\/div>",

Julio Llorente, judge,\u00a0 on the 10th of February, 1910, rendered a judgment\u00a0 in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendants\u00a0 for the sum of P610.22 Philippine\u00a0 currency, with interest at 6 per cent from the 16th of July, 1908, with the provision that if the defendants failed to pay the said\u00a0 amount,\u00a0 the plaintiffs were entitled to sell at public auction one-sixth part of the land mortgaged under\u00a0 and\u00a0 by virtue of a\u00a0 contract between Mariano Alejandrino and Cornelia\u00a0 Laochangco, dated the 30th of July, 1886.\u00a0 (See\u00a0 Exhibit\u00a0 A.)\u00a0\u00a0 Mariano\u00a0 Alejandrino was the father\u00a0 of the defendant,. Ana\u00a0 Alejandrino,\u00a0 and Cornelia Laochangco was the mother of the plaintiffs.\u00a0 Mariano Alejandrino and Cornelia\u00a0 Laochangco are both dead.<br\/><br\/>From\u00a0 the\u00a0 judgment of the\u00a0 lower\u00a0 court\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiffs appealed.<br\/><br\/>From an examination of the record, the following facts seem to be true:<br\/><br\/>First. That on the 30th of July, 1886, the said Mariano Alejandrino borrowed from the said Cornelia Laochangco the sum of P6,000 Mex., under certain conditions mentioned in the said contract.\u00a0 (See Exhibit A.)<br\/><br\/>Second. That on the 15th of August, 1895, the said Mariano\u00a0 Alejandrino and Cornelia Laochangco liquidated the amount due under the said contract, Exhibit A, and it was found on that date that there was still due under the said contract the sum of P4,115.75.\u00a0 On the same day (August 15,1895) the said Mariano Alejandrino borrowed from Cornelia Laochangco the additional sum of P234.25, making a total amount due of 4,350 pesos Mex.\u00a0 (Exhibits B.)<br\/><br\/>Third. That later, the exact date not appearing of record, the said Mariano Alejandrino died, leaving six children, the defendant herein, Ana Alejandrino, being one of them.<br\/><br\/>Fourth. That on the 15th of December, 1906, all of the children of the said Mariano Alejandrino, except the defendant\u00a0 herein,\u00a0 Ana\u00a0 Alejandrino, entered into\u00a0 a\u00a0 contract, by the terms of which they obligated themselves to pay to the plaintiffs the balance due from their father, Mariano Alejandrino.\u00a0\u00a0 (See Exhibit D.)<br\/><br\/>Fifth. That on the 23d of April, 1898, the amount due on the said contract of July 30,1886, was again liquidated and it was found that\u00a0 there\u00a0 was\u00a0 remaining due and\u00a0 unpaid on the said contract, the sum of P4,465.\u00a0\u00a0 (See Exhibit C.)<br\/><br\/>Under the provisions of Exhibit B (the contract which was entered into by all of the heirs of Mariano Alejandrino, except the defendant herein,\u00a0 Ana Alejandrino), they obligated themselves\u00a0 to\u00a0 pay their proportional\u00a0 amount of the indebtedness of their father, together\u00a0 with 12 per\u00a0 cent interest,\u00a0 the plaintiffs claim that the amount due on the contract of July 30, 1886, at the time of the commencement of the present action (the 15th of July, 1908), together with the interest amounted to the sum of P9,946.50, and that the defendant herein,\u00a0 Ana Alejandrino, was liable for one-sixth part of said\u00a0 sum, or the sum of P1,657.75.<br\/><br\/>The defendant, Ana Alejandrino, was not a party to the contract represented by Exhibit D.\u00a0 She did\u00a0 not agree to pay 12 per cent interest on the amount\u00a0 remaining due on the 23rd of April, 1898, of the debt between her father and the plaintiffs herein.\u00a0 There is no proof in the record that any demand was ever made upon her for the payment of her aliquot part of the balance found to be due on the 23rd of April, 1898, either judicially or extra judicially. She was, therefore, not liable to pay interest on her aliquot part of the said amount.\u00a0 The lower court correctly held, however, that she was liable for the\u00a0 payment\u00a0 of\u00a0 one-sixth\u00a0 part of said amount by virtue of\u00a0 her having accepted her proportional part of the property involved and covered by the original contract between\u00a0 her father\u00a0 and the mother of the plaintiffs, bearing date of\u00a0 July 30, 1886, or for the sum of 744.16 pesos Mex., which, reduced to\u00a0 conant, amounted to P610.22,\u00a0 the\u00a0 amount for\u00a0 which the lower court rendered judgment, with 6 per cent from the 16th of July, 1908. While we\u00a0 have not discussed the assignments of error in detail, we\u00a0 believe that\u00a0 we have answered each of them in\u00a0 effect.\u00a0 We have discussed the questions upon their merits as they are\u00a0 presented\u00a0 in the\u00a0 record.\u00a0 There is a question of parties, however, which has not been presented, which we can not overlook.<br\/><br\/>It will be noted that Faustino Lichauco has brought this action for himself and in representation of his co-heirs.\u00a0 So far as the record shows, the co-heirs have no knowledge of the pendency of the action.\u00a0 Faustino\u00a0 Lichauco shows no authority for representing his\u00a0 co-heirs,\u00a0 except the mere allegation\u00a0 in\u00a0 the title of his\u00a0 complaint.\u00a0 He speaks 'of himself as the plaintiff.\u00a0\u00a0 The attorney signs himself as attorney for the plaintiff\u2014not for the plaintiffs.\u00a0 Faustino Lichauco\u00a0 represents himself\u00a0 and\u00a0 his co-heirs, and the attorney-at-law, who signs the complaint,\u00a0 represents as he alleges \"the\u00a0 plaintiff.\"\u00a0 There\u00a0 is\u00a0 nothing in the\u00a0 record which shows that the co-heirs are not capable of representing themselves.\u00a0 There is nothing in the\u00a0 record\u00a0 which shows that they ever gave\u00a0 their consent to the commencement of the present action.\u00a0 It may be assumed that they did, but this is not sufficient.\u00a0\u00a0 The Code of Procedure in Civil Actions\u00a0 provides that in Courts of First Instance a party may conduct his litigation personally or by the aid of a lawyer, and his appearance must be either personal or by the aid of a duly authorized member of the bar.\u00a0 (Sec. 34, Act No.\u00a0 190.)\u00a0 In the present case the co-heirs\u00a0 are neither in court personally nor by a duly authorized member of the bar.\u00a0 Therefore they are not in court at all, and any judgment which we might\u00a0 render in the present case, with reference\u00a0 to the heirs, either pro or con, would in no way be binding upon them.\u00a0 (Espiritu\u00a0<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> vs<\/span>.\u00a0 Crossfield and\u00a0 Vicente Guasch, No. 5313).<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup><br\/><br\/>The present\u00a0 case seems\u00a0 to have been\u00a0 tried in\u00a0 the lower court upon the theory that all of the interested parties were present, and for that reason\u00a0 we have\u00a0 discussed\u00a0 the\u00a0 case upon its merits, believing that the parties would deem further litigation\u00a0 unnecessary, once being informed of\u00a0 the views of this court upon the facts presented.\u00a0 This assumption, however, is based upon the ground that even though the co-heirs\u00a0 had been represented in the trial of the cause, in accordance\u00a0 with law, no\u00a0 other\u00a0 or different\u00a0 evidence would have been adduced.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, following the decision of this court in the case of Lichauco\u00a0 <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>.

Benito did not comply with this request so Estavillo paid said taxes on September 30th.<br\/><br\/>Mariano Erice testified that when he took\u00a0 the electors' oath he did not know that he was delinquent and that on finding out this fact he immediately paid his taxes.<br\/><br\/>Victor\u00a0 Fontanilla testified that he had been absent from Laoag working in the town\u00a0 of Vintar from May,\u00a0 1909, until the 1st of October of the same year; that when he left Laoag,he requested his wife to pay his land taxes but that she\u00a0 involuntarily\u00a0 failed to do so; that when he took the electors' oath\u00a0 he did not know that his land taxes had not been paid, and that on discovering this fact he immediately paid them.<br\/><br\/>Mateo Guerrero testified that before\u00a0 the end of August, 1909, he authorized and directed his nephew, Leoncio Guerrero, to pay his land taxes in the towns of Laoag, Baccra and\u00a0 Dingras, and for this purpose turned\u00a0 over to him the sum of P5; that after so doing\u00a0 he left for the Cagayan valley and\u00a0 did not return until the 28d day of September of that year, and feeling sure that his nephew had paid the taxes on his land he\u00a0 took the\u00a0 electors' oath; that he did\u00a0 not discover that he was delinquent until sometime in October and\u00a0 then he immediately\u00a0 paid his taxes.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 testimony of this\u00a0 defendant is corroborated by that of\u00a0 his nephew, Leoncio, with reference to having received the P5 and having promised\u00a0 to pay his uncle's taxes, but\u00a0 he\u00a0 said he did\u00a0 not comply with this request for the reason that his (Leoncio's father)\u00a0 was sick and he had to remain with him.<br\/><br\/>Elias Guieb testified\u00a0 that he paid his land taxes before the election and therefore\u00a0 considered\u00a0 himself\u00a0 a qualified elector, notwithstanding the fact that he was delinquent at the time he took the electors' oath.<br\/><br\/>Gregorio Ruiz stated that he did not\u00a0 know he was delinquent until he received, in the month of October, 1909, a notification from the municipal\u00a0 treasurer,\u00a0 and that on the receipt of this notification he paid his taxes.<br\/><br\/>Leandro Domingo, a municipal policeman, testified that he delivered, on the 4th of October, to Gregorio Ruiz a delinquent tax notice, issued by the municipal treasurer.<br\/><br\/>Leopoldo Tongson testified that when he took the electors' oath he did not consider himself delinquent for the reason that he had sold, with a right to repurchase, his lands to Alejandra Mena on the 28th of April, 1908; that since that sale he had considered himself not responsible for the taxes, as they had been assumed by Mena and paid by her in the year 1908; and that these lands still appear in the tax books in his name as he had not had an opportunity to have same transferred to Alejandra Mena.<br\/><br\/>Alejandra Mena testified that it is a fact that she had purchased\u00a0 the lands\u00a0 of Leopoldo Tongson,\u00a0 with a right to redeem, and had assumed the payment of the land taxes and that she\u00a0 did pay the land taxes for the year\u00a0 1908,\u00a0 but that she had not, up to the 24th of September, paid\u00a0 said taxes for the year 1909.<br\/><br\/>Andres\u00a0 Diego\u00a0 testified\u00a0 that he\u00a0 went to the\u00a0 provincial treasurer's office in Ilocos Norte in May or June, 1909, for the purpose of paying his land tax; that he paid\u00a0 certain of his taxes and received a\u00a0 receipt therefor and that he at that time asked the clerk in the treasurer's office whether or not he still owed other taxes and received a negative reply. Believing that\u00a0 he was not delinquent he took the electors' oath, but after doing so he discovered that he still owed a part of his taxes and he then proceeded immediately to pay them.<br\/><br\/>Leon Bruno testified that when he took the electors'\u00a0 oath he thought that his\u00a0 taxes had been\u00a0 paid as he had turned over the\u00a0 money\u00a0 to\u00a0 his nephew\u00a0 Alejandro Ricardo,\u00a0\u00a0 with instructions to pay his taxes;\u00a0 that being a laborer in\u00a0 the fields he fully believed same\u00a0 had been paid, but as soon as he discovered this mistake he paid these taxes.<br\/><br\/>Alejandro\u00a0 Ricardo's testimony was corroborative of\u00a0 the above.\u00a0 He stated that his\u00a0 uncle, Leon Bruno, upon\u00a0 the latter going away to harvest\u00a0 his palay, gave him the money to pay his taxes, but as the time for\u00a0 payment of the taxes had not then expired he involuntarily\u00a0 forgot to so pay them until the 27th of September,\u00a0 at which time they were paid.<br\/><br\/>Inocente Cayetano stated that he handed the money to pay his taxes to one Francisco Guerrero, with the request that he pay said taxes. Believing that his taxes had been fully paid by Guerrero he took the electors' oath.\u00a0 Upon learning that they had not been paid he made inquiries of Guerrero and was informed that he, Guerrero, had been taken ill and\u00a0 for that reason had\u00a0 been unable to attend to\u00a0 the\u00a0 matter and further testified that he then satisfied these taxes.<br\/><br\/>Francisco Guerrero, corroborating the last witness, testified that his uncle, Inocente Cayetano, had given him on the 22d of September more than &amp;5 for the payment of his taxes; that his uncle was very busy and had not the time to spare to attend to the matter;\u00a0 that the very day on which he received this money from his uncle he, Francisco, was taken ill and was unable to leave the house for the\u00a0 period of eight days; and that his uncle was engaged in working his lands and did not know of his, witness's illness.<br\/><br\/>Timoteo Mateo testified that during the past two years his lands had been in the possession of one Antonio Fontanilla, but that his, witness', name remained on the tax books. Believing that the taxes had been paid he took the electors' oath.\u00a0 Upon learning later that they had not, he proceeded immediately to\u00a0 pay them.<br\/><br\/>Esteban Lampitoc testified that he took the electors' oath before having paid his taxes, but that as he was later unable to satisfy said taxes he did not vote on election day.<br\/><br\/>Urbano Agcaoili testified that when he left Laoag in the month of August, 1909, he charged one Toribio Alvano with the payment of his taxes; that Alvano died\u00a0 in the.month of December of that year; that believing his taxes to have been paid by Alvano he took the electors' oath, and that later upon being informed of his delinquency he proceeded immediately to pay his taxes.<br\/><br\/>Gelacio Felipe testified that the real property upon which he is charged with not having paid the taxes is\u00a0 owned and possessed in common by himself and his two brothers; that it was the duty of his two brothers to pay the taxes on this land; that on account of his duties as a member of the insular police force it was impossible for him to attend\u00a0 to the payment of these taxes\u00a0 and that after receiving notice of his delinquency he did not vote.<br\/><br\/>The following questions are raised\u00a0 for determination:<br\/><br\/><ol type=\"1\"><li>1. Should the\u00a0 demurrer\u00a0 have been sustained upon the ground that more than one crime\u00a0 is charged in the complaint?<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>2. Was it incumbent upon the prosecution to show that the notices provided in section 18 of Act Nq. 1791 had been given to each of these defendants before it can be said that they were delinquent?<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>3. If the defendants were delinquent at the time they took the electors' oath, but paid their taxes before they voted, or did hot vote at all, are they guilty of having violated the Election Law?<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>4. Must the prosecution show that\u00a0 the defendants at the time they took the electors'\u00a0 oath did\u00a0 so knowing that they were delinquent, or is it presumed that they knew this\u00a0 fact?<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>5. If the latter is the rule, have the defendants made such a showing of good faith as\u00a0 to entitle them to an acquittal on the ground that\u00a0 they honestly believed they were not delinquent at the time they took the electors' oath?<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>6. Should subsidiary imprisonment have been imposed in accordance with the provisions of Act No. 1732?<\/li><\/ol><br\/><br\/>These questions will be passed upon in their order. Paragraphs 4 and 6,\u00a0 section 30 of the Election\u00a0 Law provide as follows:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"(Par.\u00a0 4.) Any person\u00a0 who knowingly takes\u00a0 or\u00a0 sub- scribes any false\u00a0 oath, affidavit, or affirmation before any election officer, or before any court or other officer in relation to any material fact in any\u00a0 registration or election proceeding, shall be punished by imprisonment for not less than three months nor more than\u00a0 five years, or by a fine of not less\u00a0 than\u00a0 two hundred pesos nor more\u00a0 than two thousand pesos, or both, in the discretion of the court.<br\/><br\/>\"(Par. 6.) Any person who causes or attempts to cause his name to be\u00a0 registered, knowing that he is not a qualified voter in the district in which he registers, or who attempts to register, and any person who falsely represents himself as some other person to any election\u00a0 officer or\u00a0 board\u00a0 of registry, or who willfully gives a false answer relative to any matter relating to the registration\u00a0 of a voter\u00a0 or to the right of any person to vote, or who willfully aids or abets any other persons in doing any of the acts above mentioned, shall\u00a0 be\u00a0 punished by imprisonment for, not\u00a0 less\u00a0 than one month nor more than one year, or by a fine of not\u00a0 less than one hundred pesos, or more than five hundred pesos, or both, in the discretion of the court.\"<\/blockquote><br\/><br\/>The fourth\u00a0 paragraph\u00a0 defines and fixes the penalty for the crime of perjury committed in\u00a0 an\u00a0 election proceeding, and the sixth\u00a0 paragraph makes it a crime for anyone who causes or attempts to\u00a0 cause his name to be registered, knowing that he is\u00a0 not a qualified voter.<br\/><br\/>It is alleged in the\u00a0 complaint that\u00a0 the defendants\u00a0 did knowingly\u00a0 take and\u00a0 subscribe to a false oath\u00a0 and by\u00a0 so doing had their names illegally entered upon the\u00a0 registry of qualified voters.\u00a0 The\u00a0 other allegation shows what\u00a0 the defendants did to consummate this crime and that the false oath was material.\u00a0\u00a0 The defendants\u00a0 are charged with\u00a0 a single offense\u00a0 - the taking of a false oath in violation\u00a0 of section 30 of the Election Law - although\u00a0 in order to better establish the criminality of the defendants it became neces- sary for the prosecution to make a detailed statement of the various criminal acts committed by them.\u00a0 The allegation that the defendants caused their names to be entered upon the registry knowing that they were not qualified voters, might constitute, if standing alone, a separate offense, under paragraph 6,\u00a0 but in this case this allegation is used in a descriptive sense, describing or detailing the acts committed by the defendants, which, together with the other allegations, constitute the consummated crime of taking a false oath in violation of section 30 of the Election Law.\u00a0 No error, therefore, was committed in overruling the demurrer.<br\/><br\/>Sections 15,16,17, and 18 of Act No. 1791 are as follows:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"SEC.\u00a0 15. The Governor-General shall, by executive order, upon recommendation\u00a0 of the provincial board, fix a term of three months in each year within which land taxes due the municipalities of the province shall be payable.\u00a0 Such executive order\u00a0 shall be issued\u00a0 before the thirty-first day of December of each year and at least three months before the beginning of the term during which such taxes shall be collected: <i>Provided, <\/i>That in\u00a0 case no action is taken by the provincial board and by the Governor-General the date fixed for the preceding year shall be held to\u00a0 oe the date upon which the taxes shall be collected for the\u00a0 ensuing\u00a0 year. After such term is so fixed the provincial treasurer shall select a period of not less than one or more than three weeks during such term, within which said taxes shall be payable at the office of the provincial treasurer in the municipality, and such treasurer, or his deputy, shall attend and be present at said office\u00a0 during the usual office hours\u00a0 of each\u00a0 week during such period, exclusive of legal holidays, to receive payment of such taxes.\u00a0\u00a0 The provincial treasurer shall fix the time of collection in the municipality with a view to economy in the\u00a0 administration and discharge of his\u00a0 duties and the convenience of the taxpayers of\u00a0 the municipality: <i>Provided,<\/i> That\u00a0 in municipalities in which the municipal treasurer is a deputy of the provincial treasurer the\u00a0 collection period for each year shall cover the entire three months ending the day before the tax becomes delinquent.\u00a0 Notice of the dates during which said taxes may be paid in each municipality shall be posted\u00a0 by the provincial treasurer at the main entrance of the provincial building and\u00a0 of\u00a0 all municipal buildings and in a public and\u00a0 conspicuous\u00a0 place in each barrio.\u00a0\u00a0 Failure to pay the aforesaid taxes within the period specified shall subject the delinquent taxpayer to a penalty of twenty per centum of the amount of the original\u00a0 tax due, if\u00a0 paid\u00a0 within the first six months of delinquency, and a penalty of forty per centum of the orig- inal tax\u00a0 due if paid thereafter, to be collected at the\u00a0 same time and in the same manner a\u00bb the original\u00a0 tax, and the notice shall so state.\u00a0 The\u00a0 penalty shall be accounted for by the collecting officer in the same manner as the tax.<br\/><br\/>\"SEC.\u00a0 16. Fifteen days after the tax shall become delinquent the provincial treasurer, or his deputy, shall prepare and sign a certified copy of the records of his office, showing the persons delinquent in payment of their taxes\u00a0 and the amounts of tax\u00a0 and penalty\u00a0 respectively\u00a0 due from\u00a0 each of them.\u00a0 He\u00a0 may\u00a0 proceed at\u00a0 once\u00a0 to\u00a0 seize a sufficient amount of the personal\u00a0 property of\u00a0 each delinquent, and, after\u00a0 due advertisement by notice\u00a0 stating the time, place, and cause of the sale, posted for ten days at the main entrance of the municipal building and at a public and conspicuous place in the barrio where the property was seized, unless redeemed as hereinafter provided, to sell at public auction, either at the main\u00a0 entrance of the municipal building or at the place\u00a0 where such\u00a0 property is seized, in his discretion, so\u00a0 much of\u00a0 the same as\u00a0 shall satisfy the tax, penalty,\u00a0 and costs of the seizure and sale, to the highest bidder.\u00a0 The certified copy of the provincial treasurer's record of delinquents shall be the warrant for his proceedings, and the purchaser at such sale shall acquire an indefeasible title to the property sold.<br\/><br\/>\"As soon as\u00a0 possible after the sale the provincial treasurer,\u00a0 or\u00a0 his deputy, shall make\u00a0 return of his proceedings and spread it upon his record.\u00a0 Any surplus resulting from the sale, over and above the tax, penalty, and costs,\u00a0 shall be returned to the delinquent taxpayer.<br\/><br\/>\"SEC.\u00a0 17. Taxes and\u00a0 penalties assessed against realty shall be a lien thereon, which shall be superior to all other liens,\u00a0 mortgages, or incumbrances of any kind whatsoever; shall be\u00a0 enforceable against the property whether in the possession of the delinquent or any subsequent owner, and which can only be removed\u00a0 by the payment of the taxes, penalties, and costs.\u00a0 Said lien shall attach to the real property from the first day of January of the year in which the taxes were due.<br\/><br\/>\"SEC. 18, Each person delinquent in the payment of real property taxes, and all persons known to have liens thereon or to be tenants thereon, shall\u00a0 immediately be notified of the\u00a0 delinquency by the provincial\u00a0 treasurer by\u00a0 a notice deposited in the post-office, postage prepaid, and addressed to him at his last-known place of residence, or to the municipality and barrio in which\u00a0 his delinquent property is situated.\u00a0\u00a0 Such notice shall clearly state the amount of taxes due\u00a0 and the penalty which\u00a0 will be added if payment is made within six months from delinquency and the penalty which will be added if payment is made thereafter, together with a statement that the expiration of one year from the date of delinquency, unless the tax and penalties be sooner paid or the tax shall have been judicially set aside, the delinquent's real property will be forfeited\u00a0 and escheat to the Government of the Philippine Islands, and that he will be dispossessed of such property and all occupants and tenants thereon will be ejected, and thereafter the full title thereto will\u00a0 be\u00a0 and remain in\u00a0 said Government.\"<\/blockquote><br\/><br\/>Pursuant to the provisions of section 15, <i>supra<\/i>,\u00a0 the Governor-General issued on November 30,\u00a0 1907, Executive Order No. 57, fixing the months of March, April, and May, 1908, as the term within which the land taxes in the province of\u00a0 Ilocos Norte should be paid.\u00a0 No subsequent order was\u00a0 issued for the year 1909, so by virtue of the express provisions contained in said section 16, the same months in 1909 were fixed for\u00a0 the payment of these taxes in this province.<br\/><br\/>It was the duty of\u00a0 the provincial treasurer to\u00a0 select\u00a0 a period of not less than on&amp; nor more than three weeks during this term of three months within which the land taxes must be paid at his office in each municipality.\u00a0 This provision was inserted on the theory that the\u00a0 provincial treas- urer, or\u00a0 his deputies,\u00a0 would have to visit\u00a0 the\u00a0 different municipalities for the purpose of collecting the taxes.\u00a0\u00a0 One official or employee of the office of the provincial treasurer was required to be present at his office in each municipality at\u00a0 all times\u00a0 during\u00a0 office\u00a0 hours,\u00a0 Sundays\u00a0 and\u00a0 holidays excepted, during this period.\u00a0 After\u00a0 due notice\u00a0 had been given this period was considered by the legislature sufficient time for the people to pay their taxes, and also to give the\u00a0 provincial treasurer time to cover his province within the three months designated;\u00a0 but in those municipalities where the municipal treasurers were also deputies of the provincial treasurer the people\u00a0 had the whole of the three months\u00a0 in\u00a0 which\u00a0 to pay\u00a0 their taxes.\u00a0 Failure to pay the taxes within the period specified (one to three weeks, or three months, as\u00a0 the\u00a0 case may be), \"shall subject the delinquent taxpayer to a\u00a0 penalty\u00a0 of twenty per centum of the amount of the original tax due, if paid within the first six months of delinquency, and a penalty of forty per centum of the original tax due if\u00a0 paid thereafter.\"<br\/><br\/><blockquote><br\/>\"Fifteen days.after the tax shall have become delinquent the provincial treasurer,\u00a0 or his\u00a0 deputy shall prepare\u00a0 and sign a certified copy\u00a0 of the records of his office\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.

So taxes and penalties assessed\u00a0 against realty have been declared to be a first mortgage\u00a0 or\u00a0 lien on such property. (Sec. 17, supra.)\u00a0 For the enforcement of\u00a0 this lien some regular procedure must be\u00a0 provided.\u00a0 At first a\u00a0 sufficient amount of the realty was sold at public auction to the highest and\u00a0 best bidder.\u00a0 This was found\u00a0 to be, in this country, against public policy.\u00a0 Finally, and lastly, it was thought best to have delinquent real property escheat to the Philippine Government; but before this can\u00a0 be done additional notices must be given.\u00a0\u00a0 These notices must \"clearly state the amount of the taxes due and the penalty which\u00a0 will be added if payment is made within six months from the delinquency, and the penalty which will be added if payment is made thereafter, together with a statement that at the expiration\u00a0 of one year from the date of delinquency, unless the tax and penalties be sooner paid, or the tax shall have been judicially set aside,\u00a0 the delinquent real property\u00a0 will be forfeited to the Government of the Philippine\u00a0 Islands.\" (Sec. 18,<i> supra.<\/i>)<br\/><br\/>We, therefore,\u00a0 conclude that the notices provided for in section 16,\u00a0 <i>supra, <\/i>are not required to be given for the purpose of constituting\u00a0 delinquency\u00a0 but for the purposes of enforcing the tax lien against the real property.<br\/><br\/>As to the third proposition, it is\u00a0 insisted that if the defendants had the qualifications specified in section 13 of Act No. 1582 at the time they took the\u00a0 electors' oath, they did not violate any of the provisions of the Election Law by reason of being delinquent in their taxes at that time.<br\/><br\/>Said section 13 provides as follows;<br\/><blockquote><i><br\/>\"SEC\u00a0 13.<\/i> Qualification of\u00a0 voters. - Every male\u00a0 person twenty-three years of age or over who has had a legal\u00a0 residence for\u00a0 a period of\u00a0 six\u00a0 months\u00a0 immediately preceding the election in the municipality in which he exercises the suffrage, and who is not a citizen or subject of any foreign power, and who is comprised\u00a0 within\u00a0 one of the following three classes - <br\/><br\/>(<i>a<\/i>)\u00a0 Those who, prior to the thirteenth of August, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight,\u00a0 held the office of municipal captain, gobernadorcillo, alcalde, lieutenant, cabeza de barangay, or member of any ayuntamiento;<br\/><br\/>\"(b) Those who own real property to the value of five hundred pesos, or who annually pay thirty pesos or more of the established taxes;<br\/><br\/>\"(c) Those who speak, read, and write Spanish or English - shall be entitled to\u00a0 vote at\u00a0 all elections: Provided, That officers, soldiers, sailors,\u00a0 or marines of the Army or Navy of the United States shall not-be considered as having acquired legal residence within the meaning of this\u00a0 section by reason of their having\u00a0 been stationed\u00a0 in the municipalities for the required six months.\"<\/blockquote><br\/><br\/>The pertinent part\u00a0 of section 14 of the\u00a0 same Act is as follows:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"Sec. 14.

If a person knowingly takes or subscribes any false oath, affidavit, or affirmation in these proceedings in relation to any\u00a0 <i>material matter<\/i>, he then and there commits\u00a0 the crime defined and punished in\u00a0 pararaph 4 of section 30 of the Election Law.\u00a0 And\u00a0 it makes no\u00a0 difference whether he actually voted or not.\u00a0 By desisting from voting will not blot\u00a0 out the crime\u00a0 already committed.\u00a0 If he\u00a0 commits the crime by having his name entered upon the registry he is still\u00a0 disqualified as a\u00a0 voter,\u00a0 and if\u00a0 he votes knowing\u00a0 this fact\u00a0 he commits another distinct and separate offense, which is that defined and\u00a0 penalized in the first paragraph\u00a0 of\u00a0 said section 30, and may be punished accordingly.<br\/><br\/>It\u00a0 is true that section 13, supra, provides that those\u00a0 who have the qualifications set forth therein \"shall be entitled to vote at all\u00a0 elections.\" This is\u00a0 a benefit\u00a0 or privilege extended to the\u00a0 people by the Government, but before they can\u00a0 exercise\u00a0 this privilege,\u00a0 or secure for themselves\u00a0 this benefit, they have certain duties to perform, one of which is to pay their taxes.\u00a0 One who fails or refuses to perform these duties can not and should not expect to reap those benefits.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the\u00a0 fourth question, it is incumbent upon the prosecution to show that the defendants were, in fact, delinquent in the payment of their taxes at the time they took the electors' oath; and when this has been done it\u00a0 must then be presumed that the defendants knowingly and intentionally took and subscribed the false oath.\u00a0 This rule was laid down by this court in the case of U. S.<i> vs.<\/i> Tria\u00a0 (17 PhiL Rep., 303).\u00a0 In\u00a0 this\u00a0 case the defendants were charged with a criminal violation of the Election Law, in that they voted in the general election held on the 2d of November, 1909, without having the qualifications required by law\u00a0 so to do.\u00a0 In\u00a0 passing\u00a0 upon the questions therein involved this court, among other things, said:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"Under the Election Law of these Islands,\u00a0 there is\u00a0 no presumption\u00a0 that anybody is entitled to vote.\u00a0\u00a0 In fact,\u00a0 the contrary presumption\u00a0 prevails.\u00a0 This\u00a0 presumption, taken in connection with the evidence of the prosecution,\u00a0 clearly and effectively\u00a0 established a prima facie case against\u00a0 the appellants.\u00a0 Their conviction naturally and necessarily follows,\u00a0 unless\u00a0 they overcome the effect of the case made against them.\u00a0 In order to meet a prima facie case, that is, in order to destroy its effect and shift the burden of producing further evidence, the party\u00a0 denying it must produce evidence tending to negative the claim asserted to a point where, if no more evidence be given, his adversary can\u00a0 not win by\u00a0 a preponderance\u00a0 of\u00a0 evidence in\u00a0 a civil\u00a0 case, and beyond a reasonable doubt in a criminal case.<br\/><br\/>\"Where the subject-matter of a negative averment in\u00a0 an indictment, or a-fact relied upon by defendant as a justification or excuse,\u00a0 relates to him personally or otherwise lies peculiarly within his knowledge, the general rule is that the burden of\u00a0 proof as to\u00a0 such averment or fact is on him.

He asserts,\u00a0 in other words, that, to\u00a0 sustain a conviction, it is necessary to prove not only that the appellants voted illegally but, in addition, that they voted knowing their lack of qualification.\u00a0 It is well\u00a0 known\u00a0 that a presumption of criminal intention may arise from proof of the commission of an\u00a0 unlawful act, it being the general rule that, if it is proved that the accused committed the unlawful act charged, it will be presumed that the act was done with a\u00a0 criminal intention, and that it is for the accused to rebut this\u00a0 presumption.\u00a0\u00a0 While there are certain\u00a0 crimes of which a spe- cific intent to accomplish a particular purpose is an essential element\u00a0 and for which there can\u00a0 be\u00a0 no conviction\u00a0 upon proof of mere general malice or criminal intent,\u00a0 the case at bar does not fall within that class.\u00a0\u00a0 It is a\u00a0 well-settled principle that everyone is\u00a0 presumed\u00a0 to know\u00a0 the law of the land, and that one's ignorance of it furnishes no exemption from criminal responsibility for his acts.\u00a0\u00a0 The appellants, therefore, necessarily knew the law which prohibited them from voting unless they had the qualifications expressed in the\u00a0 law.\u00a0\u00a0 They\u00a0 knew\u00a0 also,\u00a0 and that\u00a0 far\u00a0 better\u00a0 than anyone else,\u00a0 whether or not they actually had those qualifications.\u00a0 The\u00a0 necessary\u00a0 consequence\u00a0 is that\u00a0 when\u00a0 they voted,\u00a0 they voted knowingly.\u00a0 They, being fully aware of their Jack of qualifications when they voted, may not now be heard to\u00a0 plead their ignorance.\u00a0 No one may be heard to plead ignorance of a fact which from the nature of things he must necessarily know better than\u00a0 anyone else.\"<\/blockquote><br\/><br\/>The only\u00a0 difference\u00a0 between this case and\u00a0 the one at bar is in the fact that in the one the defendants were tried and convicted for having voted without possessing\u00a0 the necessary qualifications, while in the\u00a0 other\u00a0 they\u00a0 were tried and convicted for having knowingly taken and subscribed a false oath in election proceedings.<br\/><br\/>In each case the defendants\u00a0 were charged with having violated the provisions of the same law.\u00a0\u00a0 The same subject matter\u00a0 (that of elections)\u00a0 was\u00a0 involved in each case.\u00a0 He who votes, knowing that he does not possess the necessary qualifications, shall be\u00a0 punished,\u00a0 etc.\u00a0\u00a0 He who knowingly takes or subscribes any false oath shall also be punished, etc.\u00a0 The act of the one is of the same nature as that of the other.\u00a0\u00a0 They (the acts) relate to the same subject matter (elections)\u00a0 so\u00a0 the doctrine laid down in that case is equally applicable to the case now under consideration.<br\/><br\/>When the defendants in the case at bar took the electors' oath they swore that they were not delinquent in the payment of their taxes.\u00a0 They read, or had read to them, sec- tions 13 and\u00a0 14 of the\u00a0 Election Law.\u00a0\u00a0 The provisions of these sections are clear, plain and easily understood.\u00a0 They admit of no\u00a0 explanation, they\u00a0 explain themselves.\u00a0 The defendants surely understood these plain and simple provisions of law.\u00a0 Each swore that: \"I have the qualifications of a voter,\u00a0 and\u00a0 none of\u00a0 the disqualifications prescribed in said sections.\"\u00a0 Not that I have been\u00a0 informed, but that I have or have not - a positive fact. To make doubly sure as to the payment of his taxes each also swore:\u00a0 \"I am\u00a0 not delinquent in the payment of\u00a0 any public taxes\u00a0 assessed against or due from me.\"\u00a0 This was the second time in\u00a0 the same oath that he swore he was not delinquent in the payment of his taxes.\u00a0\u00a0 As to whether or not he had actually paid his taxes at that time was a question of fact which\u00a0 lay peculiarly within his own knowledge.\u00a0 No one knew better than himself; he was the party most interested in the matter. There was no presumption that he was not delinquent; in fact, the contrary presumption\u00a0 prevailed.\u00a0 This presumption, taken in connection with the\u00a0 fact that\u00a0 he\u00a0 was delinquent, establishes his guilt of the crime charged, unless he has overcome, by competent proof,\u00a0 the effect of the case thus made out against him.\u00a0 In order\u00a0 to do this he must show that he had used every reasonable means\u00a0 within\u00a0 his power to ascertain whether or not his taxes had\u00a0 been paid. The best evidence of this fact is the tax\u00a0 receipt itself. But if\u00a0 the receipt is not presented he must produce other proof substantially as\u00a0 strong.\u00a0\u00a0 He can not\u00a0 substitute his oath for the\u00a0 mere statement or promise of\u00a0 another.\u00a0\u00a0 He must ascertain for himself.\u00a0 When he made application to have his name placed\u00a0 on the register as a qualified\u00a0 voter, he was seeking to exercise a privilege \"extended to him by the Government, a\u00a0 benefit, not an inherent right.\u00a0 This privilege or benefit was conditioned upon his performance of certain duties.\u00a0 He could not and should not expect to exercise such a privilege without performing his duty - in this case paying his taxes.\u00a0\u00a0 Then, again, taking the electors' oath was purely a voluntary act on his part.\u00a0 He could take it, or not, just as he choose. When it is admitted or shown, as in the case at bar, that the defendants committed the unlawful act (swearing that they were not delinquent, when in\u00a0 fact\u00a0 they were), it is presumed that they did so\u00a0 knowingly\u00a0 and\u00a0 intentionally. And when they seek\u00a0 to\u00a0 justify themselves by\u00a0 an excuse such an excuse must be reasonable and adequate.\u00a0 If it ap- pears that they voluntarily closed their eyes to\u00a0 the\u00a0 truth, or negligently failed to make inquiry,\u00a0 then their ignorance or mistake of fact is not defense.<br\/><br\/><blockquote><br\/>\"It may fairly be assumed that one who has reason to believe\u00a0 a fact exists, knows it\u00a0 exists.\u00a0 Certainly if\u00a0 he be a reasonable being.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Shaw <i>vs<\/i>. Railroad Co., 101\u00a0 U.\u00a0 S., 557.)<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/><br\/>Each one of the defendants presented what he now claims to be a justifiable excuse\u00a0 for the commission of this crime; They pretend that they did not know\u00a0 that their taxes\u00a0 had not been paid.\u00a0 They\u00a0 are reasonable\u00a0 beings\u00a0 and not only had\u00a0 reason\u00a0 to believe\u00a0 that their taxes had not been paid, but they were in a position to know this fact.\u00a0\u00a0 Not a\u00a0 single one made any inquiries to ascertain whether or not his taxes had\u00a0 been paid, but he took the electors'\u00a0 oath in which he swore positively that they had been.\u00a0\u00a0 If they\u00a0 had exercised due diligence, or had used all reasonable means within their power,\u00a0 they could\u00a0 have easily\u00a0 ascertained that\u00a0 they were delinquent.\u00a0 It would have been\u00a0 so simple\u00a0 and\u00a0 easy for them to have inquired of the municipal or provincial treasurer with reference to this fact and to have obtained the correct information.\u00a0 Each would have\u00a0 been informed by the treasurer that he Was delinquent.\u00a0\u00a0 There\u00a0 will rarely,\u00a0 if ever, be\u00a0 a case where this information can not\u00a0 be\u00a0 obtained in this manner.\u00a0 The excuses presented by these defendants fall far short of being sufficient to relieve them of criminal responsibility.\u00a0 If such flimsy excuses are accepted by the courts, then that part of the statute\u00a0 (par. 4, sec. 30 of the Election Law) becomes practically a dead letter\u00a0 The expressed will of the Legislature should not be frittered away in such a manner.\u00a0 Solemn oaths should be taken seriously. These defendants called upon God to witness the truthfulness of their statements when they took\u00a0 the\u00a0 electors' oath and at the same time voluntarily closed their eyes to the truth. They can not now be heard to\u00a0 say that they did not know they were committing this crime.\u00a0 In accordance with the very plainest principles of justice they must suffer the consequences of these\u00a0 acts.\u00a0 The Legislature has\u00a0 so declared and we must obey this\u00a0 mandate by imposing upon the de- fendants the corresponding\u00a0 penalty;\u00a0 first, because they deserve to be\u00a0 punished, and second, in order to deter others from committing the same crime.<br\/><br\/>The last paragraph of section 30 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 Election Law provides that - <br\/><br\/><blockquote><br\/>\"Whenever any person shall be convicted of\u00a0 an offense under this Act, the fine and costs imposed, if any, shall be extinguished by\u00a0 imprisonment at the rate of one day's imprisonment for each two pesos of fine or costs remaining unpaid.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/><br\/>This Act went\u00a0 into effect on January 9, 1907, and on the 1st day of October, 1907, Act No. 1732\u00a0 was passed.\u00a0 The first section\u00a0 of this Act\u00a0 provides as follows:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"When a fine\u00a0 is imposed\u00a0 as a whole or any part of the punishment\u00a0 for\u00a0 any criminal offense made\u00a0 punishable\u00a0 by any Act or Acts of the Philippine Commission, the court shall also sentence the guilty person to suffer subsidiary imprisonment until the fine is satisfied:\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.<br\/>\"(<i>a<\/i>)\u00a0 The term of such subsidiary imprisonment shall be calculated at the rate of two pesos and fifty centavos\u00a0 per day\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *.<br\/><br\/><center><br\/>*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*<br\/><\/center> <br\/><br\/>\"(<i>c<\/i>)\u00a0 In case the sentence of the court merely imposes a fine, the\u00a0 subsidiary imprisonment\u00a0 shall\u00a0 not exceed\u00a0 six months.\"<\/blockquote><br\/><br\/>No provision is made in this Act for subsidiary imprisonment in case of failure to pay the\u00a0 costs.\u00a0 The\u00a0 term \"by any Act or Acts of the Philippine\u00a0 Commission\"\u00a0 is clear and positive.\u00a0 It was intended to repeal\u00a0 any other provisions to the contrary in any and all acts of the Commission.

One class\u00a0 was composed\u00a0 of\u00a0 laborers who worked\u00a0 by the day for the Government, each one of whom\u00a0 received from the Government for each day's\u00a0 work the sum of 60 centavos and\u00a0 food.\u00a0 The other class\u00a0 was made\u00a0 up\u00a0 of cart drivers, who were apparently the owners of the carts and carabaos driven, respectively, who\u00a0 were working\u00a0 for the Government, not by the day, but were engaged in hauling sand and gravel upon the road at P1 per load.\u00a0 This latter class of laborers was not entitled to food from the Government.\u00a0 They compose the class presented in voucher Exhibit C, which contains a list of ten men who were driving carts on said road during the month of July, hauling gravel and sand at Pl per load.\u00a0 It is not charged\u00a0 in\u00a0 the complaint that the\u00a0 voucher containing the names of these men was falsified.\u00a0 The falsification\u00a0 charged\u00a0 by the information relates solely to Exhibit B, which contains a list of the men who were working for the Government by the day at 60 centavos\u00a0 a day, the Government furnishing them their food. The theory of the prosecution seems to be that Emeterio Macatangay was carried upon the time book and appears in the\u00a0 pay\u00a0 roll, Exhibit B, as being a day laborer\u00a0 of the Government, receiving 60 centavos a day and food, whereas he was, in reality,\u00a0 driving a\u00a0 cart and carabao\u00a0 belonging to the accused, and that\u00a0 the\u00a0 money\u00a0 which was paid\u00a0 for such services was drawn by the accused\u00a0 or his tool, Emeterio\u00a0 Macatangay,\u00a0 under the name\u00a0 of John McStay; that inasmuch as cart drivers were hauling by the load and\u00a0 not by the\u00a0 day, they\u00a0 received pay for\u00a0 their personal\u00a0 labor, as well\u00a0 as\u00a0 for their carts and\u00a0 carabaos,\u00a0 by means\u00a0 of\u00a0 the charge of P1 per load;\u00a0 and that if\u00a0 Emeterio Macatangay, for example, were driving a cart and carabao for the\u00a0 accused, his daily wage should be paid by the accused and not by\u00a0 the\u00a0 Government, as the payment of Pl per load by the Government\u00a0 included the services of driver, cart, and\u00a0 carabao;\u00a0 that\u00a0 the\u00a0 accused, by means of the\u00a0 crime charged, procured\u00a0 the payment to Emeterio Macatangay, by the Government, of P6.60,\u00a0 wages which ought to have been\u00a0 paid by him,\u00a0 and thereby profited\u00a0 to the\u00a0 extent\u00a0 of that\u00a0 sum.<br\/><br\/>In the consideration of the evidence in this case it should be borne in mind\u00a0 that\u00a0 Exhibit C, introduced in evidence by the prosecution,\u00a0 which\u00a0 contains a list\u00a0 of those working on said road\u00a0 who\u00a0 were\u00a0 cart drivers during the\u00a0 month of July, 1909, the\u00a0 number\u00a0 of loads\u00a0 each\u00a0 hauled\u00a0 during said\u00a0 month, and the sum\u00a0 each\u00a0 was\u00a0 entitled to receive\u00a0 for his services for said month,\u00a0 stands\u00a0 wholly\u00a0 unimpeached as to\u00a0 its accuracy.\u00a0\u00a0 While the\u00a0 learned trial court seems to assume\u00a0 that there\u00a0 is something wrong\u00a0 with, it, yet not a name, a\u00a0 word,\u00a0 or a figure\u00a0 which it contains has been proved to be incorrect or a fact which\u00a0 it\u00a0 contains to be false.\u00a0 While it may be urged that, if Emeterio Macatangay was in reality working\u00a0 as a cart driver\u00a0 on said road\u00a0 for the accused during said month, as the prosecution\u00a0 claims he W0S,\u00a0 and not as\u00a0 a day\u00a0 laborer, his name should appear on Exhibit C, we must\u00a0 note that, if the\u00a0 carabao and cart which the\u00a0 prosecution alleges\u00a0 that\u00a0 Emeterio Mecatangay was driving belonged to the accused and\u00a0 was being\u00a0 driven for him\u00a0 by Emeterio Macatangay, as is claimed by the prosecution,\u00a0 then the name which should appear on Exhibit C is that of the accused and\u00a0 not Emeterio Macatangay, inasmuch as the person whom the Government should pay would be the accused and not\u00a0 Emeterio Macatangay, the latter being required to look to the accused for\u00a0 compensation.\u00a0 So that,\u00a0 if there is any\u00a0 inaccuracy in said exhibit, even under the\u00a0 evidence offered by the prosecution, it consists in the absence of the name of the accused\u00a0 in the list of cart drivers working on said\u00a0 road or owners of carabaos and carts driven thereon.\u00a0 But, inasmuch as, if the accused actually had a\u00a0 cart and carabao in service on\u00a0 said\u00a0 road during said month, he has received, as shown by the proofs, absolutely no compensation therefor and that the Government has received such services free of charge, it is not an error\u00a0 of which the prosecution may complain, particularly when it is seen that such error in no positive way touches or is related to the alleged falsification of Exhibit B and can be used under the evidence in no possible way toward showing the guilt of the accused in committing such falsification.\u00a0 It would be little short of absurd to\u00a0 urge that a man\u00a0 who was so abandoned to cupidity and avarice as feloniously to falsify a public\u00a0 document\u00a0 (Exhibit B) in order to defraud the Government out of P6.60, would falsify another\u00a0 document\u00a0 (Exhibit C)\u00a0 in order to cheat himself out\u00a0 of\u00a0 ten\u00a0 times\u00a0 that\u00a0 sum; for if there is any error in Exhibit C, it consists, as we have said, in the absence of the name of the accused as the owner of\u00a0 a carabao and cart which rendered service on said road during July; but if the accused's driver, carabao, and cart worked during July,\u00a0 as the\u00a0 prosecution claims, then the absence of such fact on the pay\u00a0 roll demonstrates conclusively that the accused has received no pay therefor, as only those were paid whose names appear in the exhibit.\u00a0 John McStay received P71\u00a0 for the\u00a0 month of July and\u00a0 he worked\u00a0 only nineteen days.\u00a0 Emeterio\u00a0 Macatangay\u00a0 received\u00a0 P6.60.\u00a0 If the\u00a0 accused's carabao and cart had worked, they could have earned at least as much as John McStay earned with his and paid the driver besides.\u00a0 The necessary conclusion is,\u00a0 from the standpoint of the prosecution, that by one falsification the accused gained P6.60, and by another he lost at least This is absolutely the only result\u00a0 at\u00a0 which the evidence will permit us to arrive if we accept the theory of the prosecution and then test it by the proofs adduced.<br\/><br\/>It seems to us that, when a document is presented in evidence which is serviceable to the party introducing it only when the verity of the facts which it contains is impeached, and the party thus offering\u00a0 it fails utterly in his attempts to impugn its correctness,\u00a0 it is but just that\u00a0 he should be bound\u00a0 by\u00a0 every material fact which\u00a0 it contains.\u00a0 So, the prosecution in this case having offered in evidence Exhibit C for the purpose of later demonstrating that at least a portion\u00a0 of\u00a0 its contents had\u00a0 been falsified to the injury of someone interested, and\u00a0 having utterly failed to show such falsification, the prosecution should be bound by every material\u00a0 fact\u00a0 stated therein.\u00a0 There is not a scintilla of proof showing or tending to show that a single name among the ten appearing in Exhibit C is false\u00a0 or fictitious.\u00a0\u00a0 There is no\u00a0 proof whatever showing\u00a0 or\u00a0 tending to show that any one of those names covered\u00a0 a dummy.\u00a0 There is not a particle of evidence which in\u00a0 the remotest way\u00a0 indicates that any man\u00a0 of the ten was not a living, breathing entity, working faithfully with his own hands, owning the carabao and cart which he drove, and receiving for his own\u00a0 benefit the sums which he earned.\u00a0 There is not a scrap of evidence connecting the accused or Emeterio Macatangay with John McStay.\u00a0\u00a0 There is not a word\u00a0 in all the evidence of record even intimating that the accused was in any way connected with Exhibit\u00a0 C except\u00a0 that he\u00a0 was general\u00a0 overseer of the men named therein and\u00a0 certified to its .correctness.<br\/><br\/>We are perfectly aware that\u00a0 it might\u00a0 be\u00a0 possible that John McStay or some other man on the list\u00a0 in Exhibit C was\u00a0 either a\u00a0 dummy or a fictitious name used\u00a0 to\u00a0 cover Emeterio\u00a0 Macatangay in order\u00a0 that, by\u00a0 such fraud,\u00a0 the accused might induce the Government to pay\u00a0 the wages of Emeterio\u00a0 Macatangay, when\u00a0 in reality he was working for the accused.\u00a0 We are perfectly\u00a0 able to see how this\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 might happen.\u00a0\u00a0 But the question presented to us is,\u00a0 \"Did it happen?\"\u00a0 For the determination of that question we are relegated to the proofs in the record; and they show, as we have before stated, that there is no foundation whatever for such a supposition.\u00a0 Even if we concede the most that the prosecution contends\u00a0 for,\u00a0 viz, that the accused owned the cart and carabao and that Emeterio Macatangay was driving it during the time alleged, what does it signify? It does\u00a0 not necessarily mean that Exhibit C is a\u00a0 false pay roll or\u00a0 that the accused is guilty of any crime.\u00a0 Such\u00a0 a state of fact\u00a0 is entirely consistent with his innocence.\u00a0 It is perfectly harmonious with the proofs and with\u00a0 reason to assume\u00a0 that, in such case, the Government had hired of him the carabao and cart\u00a0 to be used as its own and had employed Emeterio Macatangay to drive it.\u00a0\u00a0 In that event Emeterio\u00a0 Macatangay would have\u00a0 been\u00a0 listed as a\u00a0 day laborer\u00a0 of the Government, as it is admitted\u00a0 he\u00a0 was, and neither\u00a0 one of the\u00a0 exhibits,\u00a0 by their nature,\u00a0 would\u00a0 show, as neither does, the relation between the accused and the Government.\u00a0\u00a0 It nowhere\u00a0 appears\u00a0 in the record that the accused ever drew a centavo out of the public treasury except for\u00a0 his personal services as road and\u00a0 bridge\u00a0 foreman; or that he ever received\u00a0 a centavo for the services of a carabao\u00a0 and cart, or for the labor of Emeterio Macatangay.<br\/><br\/>We hold, therefore, that the\u00a0 accuracy and truth of Exhibit C have not been impeached\u00a0 or impugned,\u00a0 and the facts therein\u00a0 stated must accordingly be taken as true.<br\/><br\/>After a careful reading\u00a0 of the testimony in the record, both oral and documentary, we are of the opinion that the judgment of\u00a0 conviction must be reversed.\u00a0 The evidence comes far\u00a0 short of showing the defendant guilty of the crime charged.\u00a0\u00a0 The condition of the proofs leaves much to be assumed.\u00a0 From what has already been said, it is apparent that to find the accused guilty upon the theory of the prosecution, and that\u00a0 is the only theory presented\u00a0 to us by the briefs or by the record, it is necessary to make the following assumptions, which must be made in effect without proof:<br\/><ol type=\"1\"><li>It involves the necessity of finding that Canuto Manalo was a <i>particeps criminis.<\/i><br\/><br\/>As we have already noted, the time book from which was made up that portion of the pay roll (Exhibit B) alleged to\u00a0 be falsified\u00a0 was kept by Canuto Manalo.\u00a0 If Emeterio Macatangay was not working for the\u00a0 Government by\u00a0 the day but, instead, was employed by the\u00a0 accused as a driver of\u00a0 his\u00a0 carabao\u00a0 and cart, then\u00a0 Manalo falsified the time book and made a false\u00a0 report\u00a0 to the assistant engineer. He was also in charge of the gang of men who were drawing sand and gravel by the load and kept a record of\u00a0 the number of loads which\u00a0 each man drew.\u00a0 There were only ten men thus engaged,\u00a0 of\u00a0 whom he had charge and concerning whom the evidence speaks.\u00a0 If\u00a0 John McStay was a fictitious person or if he was the pay-roll name of Emeterio Macatangay or of the accused, then Manalo again falsified the record and\u00a0 misstated the fact when he said in Exhibit C that John McSfay had drawn 71 loads of gravel during the month of July and was entitled to P71\u00a0 from Government funds.\u00a0 It is impossible upon the record to find\u00a0 the accused\u00a0 guilty\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 crime\u00a0\u00a0 charged\u00a0 without\u00a0 finding Manalo equally guilty.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>It involves finding that Crispin Ribargoso, deputy provincial\u00a0 treasurer, was,\u00a0 in\u00a0 effect, also\u00a0 either a <i> particeps criminis <\/i>or was grossly negligent in the discharge of\u00a0 his duties.\u00a0\u00a0 Qn the pay roll, Exhibit B, said deputy provincial treasurer certified that he,\u00a0 on the 8th and 9th of August, 1909, paid to Emeterio Macatangay the sum of P6.60 for work performed by him for the Government as a day laborer on the Lucena-Tayabas Road during said month of July, and that he made\u00a0 such payment in\u00a0 the presence of Salvador Lagdameo, who also certifies on the same pay roll that such payment was actually made in his presence.\u00a0\u00a0 The said deputy provincial treasurer\u00a0 also certified\u00a0 on\u00a0 Exhibit\u00a0 C that on the\u00a0 8th and 9th of August\u00a0 he paid John McStay the sum of P71, the same being for hauling 71 loads of gravel at Pl\u00a0 per load, and that such payment was made in the presence of Salvador Lagdameo, who also certifies in said exhibit that such\u00a0 payment was made in his presence.\u00a0 If\u00a0 John McStay was a fictitious name, and the person who was really\u00a0 driving said carabao and cart was Emeterio Macatangay, as the prosecution\u00a0 would have\u00a0 us believe, then the said deputy provincial treasurer was guilty of paying Emeterio Macatangay for\u00a0 working in two capacities\u00a0 at the same time.\u00a0 It appears from the exhibits that John McStay and\u00a0 Emeterio Macatangay both\u00a0 worked on the Lucena-Tayabas\u00a0 Road on\u00a0 the following days in July: On the 9th, 10th, 20th, 21st, 22d, 23d, 24th, 28th, 29th, and 30th.\u00a0 For those days John McStay\u00a0 received pay and Emeterio Macatangay received pay, the one as a cart driver and the other as a day laborer.\u00a0\u00a0 It is\u00a0 thus evident that if McStay was the pay-roll name\u00a0 of Macatangay, then\u00a0 the deputy provincial treasurer paid Emeterio Macatangay for those days as a laborer and then immediately turned about and paid him for the very same days as\u00a0 a cart driver.\u00a0 In other\u00a0 words, if John McStay\u00a0 and Emeterio Macatangay were the same person, then the deputy provincial treasurer paid one man for doing two men's work, each one working at the same time in widely separated places.\u00a0 If McStay was a fictitious person, Who collected the\u00a0 P71?\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 deputy\u00a0 provincial treasurer paid said sum.\u00a0 There is\u00a0 no question\u00a0 about that. There\u00a0 is not a syllable of evidence in\u00a0 the\u00a0 case going to show that Emeterio Macatangay received the P71, or any part thereof, or that the accused received said sum, or any part thereof.\u00a0 Somebody received it, if the certificate\u00a0 of the deputy provincial treasurer is\u00a0 correct.\u00a0 Who was it? There is not a scrap of evidence showing that it was anyone except John McStay.\u00a0 While some of the witnesses for the prosecution testified that Emeterio Macatangay did not work on said road during the month of July except as\u00a0 a cart driver, yet, as we have already observed, the prosecution has introduced evidence in\u00a0 the\u00a0 shape of Exhibit C, a duly certified voucher containing the names of all the men who drove\u00a0 carts on\u00a0 that road during the month of July,\u00a0 the number of loads that each drew, and the amount of money to which each was entitled\u00a0 for such services,\u00a0 and in that exhibit the name of Emeterio Macatangay does not appear. Moreover, that exhibit carries upon its face proof that Emeterio Macatangay was not a cart driver during that period and that he was not working on that road under a fictitious or different name\u00a0 than\u00a0 his own, because that\u00a0 exhibit contains a certificate in which the deputy provincial treasurer states\u00a0 officially and directly that he paid ten different men for performing the labor\u00a0 referred to\u00a0 and that not\u00a0 one of them was Emeterio Macatangay.\u00a0\u00a0 He certified in that exhibit that he paid Ananias Rago, not Emeterio Macatangay, P27; that he paid Pedro Ramirez, not Emeterio Macatangay, P13; that\u00a0 he paid Pelix Marasigan, not Emeterio\u00a0 Macatangay, P6; that he paid John McStay, not Emeterio Macatangay, P71; that he\u00a0 paid Camilo Puresa, not Emeterio Macatangay, P6; that he paid Nicetas\u00a0 Danes, not Emeterio Macatangay, P2; that he paid Primo\u00a0 Sante, not Emeterio Macatangay, Pl; that he\u00a0 paid Elisario\u00a0 Pabello, not Emeterio Macatangay,\u00a0 P1; that he paid\u00a0 Florencio Salamillas, not Emeterio Macatangay, P26; that he\u00a0 paid Valerio Enriquez, not Emeterio Macatangay, P3.\u00a0 There also appears on the face of said exhibit a receipt from each one\u00a0 of the persons to\u00a0 whom money was paid, signed by each person in his\u00a0 own handwriting or in the handwriting of\u00a0 someone who signed for him.\u00a0 Upon that pay\u00a0 roll is the name of John McStay apparently in his own\u00a0 handwriting,\u00a0 which handwriting is\u00a0 entirely different from that of any\u00a0 other name\u00a0 appearing on the roll.\u00a0 Moreover, Salvador Lagdameo certified in said exhibit that the payment to each one of the\u00a0 persons heretofore\u00a0 named for services rendered as cart driver was made in his presence.\u00a0\u00a0 The payments made to the\u00a0 men for those services were made at substantially the same time and place as the payments made to the laborers who\u00a0 were working\u00a0 for\u00a0 the\u00a0 Government by the day; so\u00a0 that if Emeterio\u00a0 Macatangay\u00a0 was\u00a0 paid for services rendered as a day laborer for the Government, as the deputy provincial\u00a0 treasurer certifies, and\u00a0 then\u00a0 presented himself again to be paid as a\u00a0 cart driver, the services rendered as such having been performed upon many of the very days for which he had already received pay as a day laborer for the Government, it is almost impossible that the persons\u00a0 paying him would not have\u00a0 discovered the fraud.\u00a0 It thus appears that\u00a0 the evidence of the witnesses for the prosecution tending to show\u00a0 that Emeterio Macatangay\u00a0 was a\u00a0 cart driver in the month of July and not a day laborer is\u00a0 contradicted and destroyed\u00a0 by\u00a0 the documentary evidence introduced by the prosecution\u00a0 itself in the shape of Exhibit C.\u00a0 The accused had nothing whatever to do with the\u00a0 payment of the sums stated\u00a0 in\u00a0 said exhibit.\u00a0\u00a0 The deputy\u00a0 provincial treasurer and the person in whose presence he made the payments are not charged\u00a0 with falsification or\u00a0 with misstating\u00a0 the facts which appear in that document.\u00a0 Both of them certified\u00a0 that they\u00a0 paid each of ten\u00a0 individuals, each one having a separate entity, not one of them being either Emeterio Macatangay or the\u00a0 accused in this case. It is perfectly evident that\u00a0 in order to find that Emeterio Macatangay was not a day\u00a0 laborer but was a\u00a0 cart driver, this\u00a0 court\u00a0 must find that the deputy provincial\u00a0 treasurer and Salvador Lagdameo\u00a0 were either falsifiers of a public document or were grossly negligent in the performance of their duties.\u00a0 This is necessary inasmuch as it appears, if the theory\u00a0 of the\u00a0 prosecution is correct,\u00a0 that said officials paid Emeterio Macatangay\u00a0 for\u00a0 services\u00a0 as a day laborer during the\u00a0 month\u00a0 of July and then turned about and paid him for services rendered as a cart driver for at least a\u00a0 considerable portion of the same time.\u00a0 Unless we\u00a0 hold that to have been done, the accused can not be charged with having used Emeterio Macatangay in a double capacity or with using John\u00a0 McStay or any other person as a dummy to draw money illegally from the Government treasury.\u00a0 The\u00a0 officials above named certified\u00a0 that the\u00a0 ten men heretofore enumerated were the only men who worked as cart drivers during the month of July.\u00a0 Among those ten are not found either the defendant,\u00a0 Emeterio Macatangay, or\u00a0 a dummy. Each of those ten men, according to the unimpeached certificate of said officials, was a person, an entity who\u00a0 appeared before said officials, who received his pay, and who signed a receipt therefor.\u00a0\u00a0 In the consideration of this case, then, we must discard either the oral testimony introduced by the prosecution for the purpose of proving that\u00a0 Emeterio Macatangay worked as a cart driver, not as a day laborer, during the month of July,\u00a0 or we must\u00a0 reject\u00a0 the documentary testimony offered by the prosecution in\u00a0 the shape of Exhibit C,\u00a0 in which\u00a0 it is proved by\u00a0 certificate of\u00a0 public officials that Emeterio Macatangay was\u00a0 not a cart driver during the month of July but was a day laborer and received pay as such.\u00a0 In this\u00a0 connection it must be remembered that Exhibit C\u00a0 is not the pay roll alleged to be\u00a0 falsified.\u00a0 The defendant is charged, according to the information and according to the brief of the\u00a0 attorney-general, with\u00a0 having\u00a0 falsified Exhibit B.\u00a0 It must be further noted, as we have already observed, that neither said document nor the truth of any of the facts stated therein has been impeached or impugned.<\/li><\/ol>In addition, we may call attention to the fact that Emeterio Macatangay worked from the 6th to the 10th of\u00a0 July, inclusive,\u00a0 also\u00a0 from the 20th to the 24th, inclusive,\u00a0 and from the\u00a0 28th to the\u00a0 30th, inclusive, making\u00a0 11 days in all, he working on some of those dates only half days.\u00a0 This is admitted by the prosecution.\u00a0 It is also admitted that John McStay,\u00a0 or someone impersonating him, worked July 9th to 10th, inclusive, 12th to 17th, inclusive, 20th to 24th, inclusive, and 26th to\u00a0 31st, inclusive.\u00a0 It is the testimony of\u00a0 the prosecution, and this is entirely undisputed,\u00a0 that Emeterio Macatangay was sick for about two weeks during the month of July, possibly during the time intervening between the 10th and 20th of July, when the records show that he was not at work, although he\u00a0 alleges that he was taken sick\u00a0 the\u00a0 first day of July.\u00a0 It being admitted\u00a0 that he was sick for this period of time during the month of July, no matter what part, how could he have been working under the name of John McStay, when it appears from the records presented as proof that John McStay\u00a0 worked substantially the entire month of July, without a\u00a0 break in the continuity of his labor except now and then a day or two.<br\/><br\/>The oral\u00a0 testimony introduced by the prosecution shows that the carabao and cart which, it is alleged by the witnesses of the prosecution, Emeterio Macatangay was driving during the month of July were a cart and carabao bought by the accused from one Felix Marasigan.\u00a0 Serapio Sarto, a\u00a0 witness for the accusation,\u00a0 testified that:<br\/><blockquote>\"One Sunday, about nine o'clock in\u00a0 the morning in the month of July,\u00a0 I do not\u00a0 remember the date,\u00a0 I\u00a0 heard the defendant ask Felix if he had any carabaos for sale.\u00a0\u00a0 Felix answered\u00a0 the defendant 'If\u00a0 you wish to buy my cart and carabao, I will sell them\u00a0 to you.'\u00a0\u00a0 Isaac\u00a0 asked Felix how much he wanted for this cart and carabao.\u00a0\u00a0 Then Felix asked him\u00a0 P250 for both\u00a0 cart and\u00a0 carabao.\u00a0\u00a0 Isaac\u00a0 offered him P230 but they did\u00a0 not come to\u00a0 an agreement\u00a0 and\u00a0 they separated.\u00a0\u00a0 I saw the defendant on the\u00a0 evening of\u00a0 that Sunday in Felix's house.\u00a0 I saw\u00a0 Felix and the\u00a0 defendant take the cart and carabao to\u00a0 the defendant's house.\"<\/blockquote>Felix Marasigan,\u00a0 another witness for\u00a0 the\u00a0 prosecution, testified:<br\/><blockquote>\"On the morning of\u00a0 one Sunday, he, the accused,\u00a0 talked to me about buying this carabao, but we did not come to an agreement until four o'clock in the afternoon\u00a0 and at\u00a0 that time I took the carabao to his\u00a0 house. It was in the month of July of this year.\u00a0 If it\u00a0 was not on\u00a0 the 9th it was on the 10th.\u00a0 It was Sunday.\u00a0 At the time\u00a0 when Mr. Isaac bought this carabao of me he asked me\u00a0 if I knew Emeterio Macatangay.\u00a0 I told him,\u00a0 yes I knew him.\u00a0 He\u00a0 asked me if\u00a0 he was a good man and I said, yes, a good man.\u00a0 He told me, I am going to see this man to take care of my carabao and use him as my driver.\u00a0 I told him, yes, that is good, because he is an old cart driver.\u00a0 I carried sand and gravel on the road to Tayabas during three days.\u00a0 Only one day elapsed after these three days before I sold the carabao to Mr. Isaac.\u00a0 I arrived here Friday evening and Sunday next I sold the carabao to Mr. Isaac.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In connection with this\u00a0 testimony,\u00a0 it should be noticed that\u00a0 neither the 9th or 10th of July, 1909, was Sunday. The 11th was Sunday.\u00a0 It is, therefore evident that if\u00a0 the accused\u00a0 bought the carabao of Felix Marasigan, he\u00a0 did not buy it or obtain possession of it until 4 o'clock, Sunday afternoon, the 11th of July.\u00a0 This being so,\u00a0 it becomes very important to notice that, at the time when\u00a0 he obtained possession of the carabao Emeterio\u00a0 Macatangay had been working five days, namely, the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th of July.\u00a0 It being conceded by the\u00a0 prosecution\u00a0 that\u00a0 the only carabao which Emeterio Macatangay is alleged to have driven in the month of July is the\u00a0 one which Marasigan is alleged to have sold to the accused,\u00a0 it is impossible that Emeterio Macatangay could have been driving\u00a0 the defendant's carabao during those five days, for the\u00a0 simple and obvious reason that the accused did not at that time own the\u00a0 carabao in question or have it\u00a0 in his possession.\u00a0 In this connection, it should be noted that, according to\u00a0 the evidence of the prosecution, the eight days of carabao driving were\u00a0 the first eight days which\u00a0 Emeterio Macatangay worked during the month of July,\u00a0 The three days of road work for the Government by the day,\u00a0 making\u00a0 eleven days in all, were the last three days which he worked during that month.\u00a0 All this is shown by the evidence of the\u00a0 prosecution.\u00a0 It should also be noted with great care that, at the time the accused became the owner of the carabao in question, John McStay had been working two\u00a0 days, namely, the 9th and 10th of\u00a0 July.\u00a0\u00a0 It is, therefore, impossible that he could have been driving the carabao which the accused is\u00a0 alleged to have\u00a0 bought\u00a0 from Marasigan.\u00a0\u00a0 The charge then that Emeterio\u00a0 Macatangay was\u00a0 driving the carabao belonging to the accused during eight out of the\u00a0 eleven days on which he worked during the month of July\u00a0 is necessarily untrue under the people's own testimony<br\/><br\/>So far we have considered only the testimony introduced by the prosecution.\u00a0\u00a0 From the observations already made, it is evident that the prosecution failed to make out a case against the accused and that the action\u00a0 should have\u00a0 been dismissed and the accused acquitted\u00a0 at\u00a0 the close of the people's case, in conformity with the motion made by counsel for the defendant.<br\/><br\/>When we come to examine the proofs introduced by the defendant, we find\u00a0 the case in\u00a0 his favor\u00a0 still stronger. Morgan Cilley, the assistant engineer in charge of the construction\u00a0 of the road\u00a0 in\u00a0 question, testified that the pay roll alleged to have been falsified by the accused was made up by clerks in his office from data furnished by the inferior bosses or <i>capataces <\/i> who were working under the supervision of the accused.\u00a0\u00a0 He testified that:<br\/><blockquote>\"Williams\u00a0 had nothing\u00a0 to\u00a0 do\u00a0 with the making out of the time\u00a0 book or pay roll\u00a0 or\u00a0 anything in connection with this pay roll except to sign his name.\u00a0\u00a0 The <i>capataz <\/i>makes out the time\u00a0 book, with the name and days' labor which the man has performed, and that is brought into my office and approved there and certified by Isaac Williams.\u00a0 I\u00a0 sign the pay roll\u00a0 and certify to it the same that Williams did in the pay roll.\u00a0\u00a0 I do not\u00a0 know who is responsible to the Government for any wrongdoing, if there is any.\u00a0 The <i>capataz<\/i> is responsible for the correct\u00a0 keeping\u00a0 of the time\u00a0 book and he is responsible to Isaac Williams.\"<\/blockquote>The\u00a0 court put the following question to this\u00a0 witness:<br\/><blockquote>\"Q. I want to know who is responsible to you for\u00a0 this time book and the correctness of it, Isaac Williams or the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">capataz<\/span> direct. - A. The man that made out the time\u00a0 book is.\u00a0 He is directly responsible to him.\"<\/blockquote>Canuto\u00a0 Manalo testified as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"This is the time\u00a0 book in which\u00a0 we kept the list of all the workmen on the construction of the road for the Government.\u00a0 I\u00a0 wrote the names in this\u00a0 time book.\u00a0 The\u00a0 name of Emeterio Macatangay appears in this book.\u00a0 He worked on the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 20th half a day, on the 21st a whole day, 22d whole day, 23d half a day, 24th whole day, 28th\u00a0 half a day, 29th half a day, also the 30th all day. I know he worked on these dates because I am the <i>capataz<\/i> and he was under my direction.\u00a0\u00a0 The kind of work he did during these days is as follows: One day he worked scattering gravel along the road.\u00a0\u00a0 As he did not know this work I told him to\u00a0 discontinue it. Then I put him to work on the ground to get sand.\u00a0 On these days which I have marked he\u00a0 worked three days driving\u00a0 a\u00a0 bull cart.\u00a0 He drove a carabao cart three\u00a0 days from the\u00a0 1st of July and then he stopped.\u00a0 He drove the bull cart on the 1st, 2d,\u00a0 and 3d of July.\u00a0\u00a0 I did not put\u00a0 that down\u00a0 in the time book because Mr. Isaac paid him for that work.\u00a0 He did not work\u00a0 for the Government\u00a0 at that time;\u00a0 he worked\u00a0 for\u00a0 a\u00a0 private man.\u00a0\u00a0 I am absolutely sure that\u00a0 the days I marked in that book\u00a0 were days worked by Macatangay on the road\u00a0 and in the gravel pit. I would\u00a0 not have entered his name there if he\u00a0 had\u00a0 not worked\u00a0 for the Government.\"<br\/><br\/>Later when asked on cross-examination who\u00a0 paid Emeterio\u00a0 Macatangay for those\u00a0 three days, he said,\u00a0 \"I\u00a0 do not know who paid him.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The witness Fructuoso\u00a0 Marto testified in part as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"During the month of\u00a0 July I\u00a0 was working on the road near a distillery in Tayabas.\u00a0\u00a0 Canuto Manalo was my <i>capataz,<\/i>\u00a0\u00a0 Emeterio Macatangay\u00a0 was\u00a0 working on the sand pit. I know he was\u00a0 working on the sand pit because every evening we\u00a0 gathered\u00a0 together in the sand pit to get our rice.\u00a0 We slept during the night at that place. All the loads of sand were\u00a0 dumped on the road near\u00a0 the distillery.\u00a0 I generally\u00a0 unloaded\u00a0 all the carts\u00a0 that arrived loaded with sand.\u00a0\u00a0 I do not know whether or\u00a0 not Emeterio Macatangay unloaded his cart\u00a0 in any\u00a0 other place but in\u00a0 my place, no. I worked during the whole month of July without missing a day.\u00a0 Emeterio Macatangay did not work the whole month but\u00a0 worked only eleven days.\u00a0 He worked\u00a0 with me.\u00a0\u00a0 During\u00a0 the 11 days he worked there\u00a0 in the sand pit.\"<\/blockquote>The learned trial court seems\u00a0 to lay much stress\u00a0 upon the claim\u00a0 that\u00a0 it was the duty of the\u00a0 accused to know with certainty each one of the men who was working on the road, each day they worked, and the\u00a0 number of hours each one worked per day, and\u00a0 that he should be held responsible criminally if he certified a\u00a0 pay roll which\u00a0 was not absolutely\u00a0 correct.\u00a0 This\u00a0 contention\u00a0 has value\u00a0 only when we concede that there was a mistake in the pay roll as certified by the accused. This fact has not in any\u00a0 way been proved, but it may be interesting to note that,\u00a0 even if there had\u00a0 been\u00a0 a mistake in the pay\u00a0 roll as\u00a0 certified to by the\u00a0 accused, still he is\u00a0 not necessarily guilty\u00a0 of &amp; falsification.\u00a0\u00a0 His guilt would\u00a0 depend upon the circumstances.\u00a0 It must be remembered in this connection\u00a0 that there were nearly 200 men working on the\u00a0 road in question, as appears from the\u00a0 exhibits introduced in evidence. The duty of the accused appears to have\u00a0 been of a supervisory character, seeing to\u00a0 it that the road was constructed according to the plans and specifications made by Morgan Cilley, the\u00a0 assistant engineer.\u00a0\u00a0 With these duties laid upon him, it\u00a0 would be going\u00a0 a\u00a0 long\u00a0 way to say that he ought to be held criminally responsible for not knowing every one of\u00a0 the nearly 200 men\u00a0 working\u00a0 on\u00a0 the road at the time,\u00a0 whether or not each one of them was\u00a0 working each day and how many hours each worked\u00a0 per day.\u00a0\u00a0 If he were\u00a0 required to know all this in\u00a0 such\u00a0 complete detail, he would have little time to perform his\u00a0 other duties. It is apparent from the\u00a0 proofs\u00a0 presented\u00a0 that\u00a0 it was\u00a0 the duty of the\u00a0 various inferior\u00a0 bosses\u00a0 working under\u00a0 the direction and\u00a0 control of the accused to make a record of the names\u00a0 of the men who were working, and the number of days\u00a0 or hours that\u00a0 they worked.\u00a0\u00a0 It\u00a0 was essential to have some one\u00a0 take at\u00a0 least\u00a0 a portion\u00a0 of that work off of the shoulders of the accused, or it is quite probable that the other duties\u00a0 which were imposed\u00a0 upon\u00a0 him by virtue of his position would have gone unattended.\u00a0 It is, therefore,\u00a0 very\u00a0 questionable indeed\u00a0 whether the accused, even if there\u00a0 were an\u00a0 error in the pay\u00a0 roll as certified, would, under the circumstances, be guilty of a crime unless it was shown that he certified the roll knowing its falsity.<br\/><br\/>The learned\u00a0 trial court\u00a0 says\u00a0 in his opinion:<br\/><blockquote>\"Defendant does not or\u00a0 did\u00a0 not deny that\u00a0 he was road and bridge foreman, whose duty as such foreman was to be in charge of the laborers; keep the time\u00a0 and certify it for payment;\u00a0 and offered no evidence to show that he was not responsible.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It was shown upon proofs of the prosecution, as well as those of the accused, that it was not\u00a0 primarily\u00a0 the duty of the latter to\u00a0 keep the time.\u00a0\u00a0 That was the duty of the <i>capataz. <\/i>\u00a0 As to\u00a0 his not having offered any evidence to show that\u00a0 he was not responsible, the proofs\u00a0 of the prosecution, as well\u00a0 as\u00a0 those of the defense, show what the duties of the accused were.\u00a0 From\u00a0 such proofs it appears that the most that can be said\u00a0 of the responsibility of the accused in this connection\u00a0 is that he\u00a0 was responsible only in a general way.\u00a0 It does not appear\u00a0 in evidence that it was the duty of the accused to hire or\u00a0 discharge\u00a0 laborers. It does not appear that he hired Macatangay\u00a0 or John McStay.\u00a0\u00a0 If he\u00a0 was not responsible for these men being engaged upon\u00a0 Government\u00a0 work, it is difficult to\u00a0 see how he could have manipulated\u00a0 Emeterio Macatangay and John McStay in the manner in which\u00a0 he is alleged to have manipulated them.<br\/><br\/>The learned trial court further says in his opinion:<br\/><blockquote>\"The defendant did not see fit to\u00a0 go upon the stand and give an explanation of the charges and damaging testimony against him, but allowed it to be proven,\u00a0 not only by the witnesses\u00a0 for the prosecution,\u00a0 but\u00a0 by\u00a0 the two witnesses he did produce in his behalf, t<i>hat he was hauling sand and gravel at so much a load to the read he was building with his private\u00a0 teams as well as with teams belonging to\u00a0 the province.\"<\/i><\/blockquote>We are unable to find evidence to\u00a0 support\u00a0 this finding of the learned trial court.\u00a0 As we have already seen from the testimony of Canuto Manalo and\u00a0 Fructuoso Marto above quoted, the exact contrary appears.\u00a0 Both\u00a0 of these men testified that Emeterio Macatangay\u00a0 did not work driving a earabao during the 11\u00a0 days mentioned in Exhibit B, but that he worked as a day laborer for the Government in the sand pit.<br\/><br\/>The learned trial court further says:<br\/><blockquote>\"Such a thing\u00a0 may be carried\u00a0 on\u00a0 perfectly\u00a0 fair and honestly and in itself may not be wrong, certainly\u00a0 not criminal if done with the knowledge and consent of his department; but when it is remembered that this defendant keeps the time of\u00a0 laborers for the province and counts his loads of sand and gravel and pays his own laborers, or uses the laborers paid by the province as he is charged, it seems that said defendant would wish to explain for himself and department, etc.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Throughout the whole record we have been unable to find any proof which shows or tends to\u00a0 show that \"defendant keeps the time\u00a0 of laborers for the province and counts his loads of said and gravel, and pays his own laborers.\"\u00a0 As we\u00a0 have already indicated, from the evidence\u00a0 of Cilley, of <i>capataz<\/i> Manalo and of witness Marto, the contrary seems to have been proved.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 learned trial court further says:<br\/><blockquote>\"He had at least one cart and cartman at work on\u00a0 the road, for all the witnesses, including his own, one of whom said he kept the time and knew\u00a0 Macatangay worked\u00a0 three days driving defendant's cart, but presumed defendant paid him for it.\u00a0 It\u00a0 is true that although defendant had a team hauling gravel\u00a0 his\u00a0 name does not appear on the pay roll made out to his department and\u00a0 approved by Mr. Cilley.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>So far as we have been able to ascertain from a careful reading of the record, it nowhere\u00a0 appears that\u00a0 \"defendant had a team hauling\u00a0 gravel.\"\u00a0 It is true\u00a0 that two\u00a0 of the people's witnesses testified that Emeterio\u00a0 Macatangay drove a earabao and cart but\u00a0 it also\u00a0 appears\u00a0 from the prosecution's own testimony that\u00a0 Emeterio Macatangay was not one of them, neither was the accused one of them, and neither was there\u00a0 anybody working for the accused or on his\u00a0 behalf upon said road driving a earabao and cart.<br\/><br\/>The learned trial court further says:<br\/><blockquote>\"The\u00a0 evidence\u00a0 of\u00a0 Macatangay\u00a0 is not only not disputed in some particulars but corroborated by the two witnesses for the\u00a0 defendant.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Macatangay testified that in the month of July he drove a carabao cart eight days out of the eleven for which he received\u00a0 pay.\u00a0\u00a0 The witness Canuto Manalo testified positively that Macatangay did not drive a\u00a0 carabao cart during even\u00a0 one of\u00a0 said\u00a0 eleven days but instead worked in\u00a0 the sand pit as a day laborer for the Government.\u00a0\u00a0 The other witness\u00a0 for the defendant, Marto, testified that during the eleven days of July Emeterio Macatangay was working with him in the sand pit\u00a0 as a day laborer for the\u00a0 Government and that they worked\u00a0 together by day and slept together at night, and that they both drew their rations from\u00a0 the Government as day laborers.\u00a0 From this testimony we are unable to see how the evidence of Macatangay is\u00a0 not\u00a0 disputed but is corroborated\u00a0 by the witnesses for the defendant.<br\/><br\/>The trial court\u00a0 further says:<br\/><blockquote>\"Macatangay and\u00a0 three witnesses\u00a0 for the prosecution swore that Macatangay drove the carabao and cart bought by defendant from Marasigan, hauling sand and gravel in July last for eight days.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>We have already shown that, according to the testimony of the witnesses\u00a0 for the prosecution\u00a0 themselves,\u00a0 the\u00a0 accused did not obtain possession of the carabao and cart which Macatangay is alleged to have driven until 4 o'clock on the afternoon\u00a0 of the 11th of July; and it appears that, at that\u00a0 time, Macatangay had been\u00a0 working five\u00a0 days on the road and these five days are five of the days in which the witnesses for\u00a0 the prosecution\u00a0 allege that Emeterio Macatangay was driving\u00a0 the\u00a0 carabao\u00a0 and cart belonging to the accused.\u00a0 It is impossible for this testimony to be true because\u00a0 Emeterio\u00a0 Macatangay could not have been driving the\u00a0 carabao and cart belonging to the accused when the accused had not yet obtained\u00a0 either ownership or possession of the carabao and cart in question.<br\/><br\/>The learned trial court further says:<br\/><blockquote>\"Capataz Canuto\u00a0 Manalo said on the first days of July last,\u00a0 viz, 1st, 2d and 3d, Macatangay\u00a0 drove\u00a0 defendant's cart, but that he did not put these days on Macatangay's daily time record because he presumed defendant paid him, as Macatangay was working for him.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It nowhere appears in the record or in the testimony of Canuto Manalo that Macatangay drove accused's carabao the 1st, 2d,\u00a0 and 3d of July.\u00a0\u00a0 He simply says\u00a0 that Emeterio Macatangay drove a carabao <i>for a private person<\/i> on those days and that someone, he don't\u00a0 know who, paid him for it.\u00a0 Emeterio Macatangay himself testified\u00a0 that he fell sick on\u00a0 the\u00a0 1st\u00a0 day of\u00a0 July and was sick \"perhaps two weeks, more or less.\"\u00a0 AH of the other witnesses, both of the prosecution and of the defendant, who have touched that subject, testified that Emeterio Macatangay worked only eleven days in July, beginning with the\u00a0 6th and ending with\u00a0 the\u00a0 30th.\u00a0 Moreover, as the evidence\u00a0 does not show that the accused ever owned more than one carabao and cart, the one he\u00a0 is alleged to have purchased from Marasigan, and inasmuch as he possessed that carabao for the first time on the afternoon of\u00a0 the\u00a0 11th\u00a0 day of July, it is impossible that Emeterio Macatangay could have\u00a0 driven his carabao and cart on the 1st, 2d, and 3d\u00a0 of July.\u00a0 This being so,\u00a0 we can not see how it can be true that he drove a\u00a0 carabao and cart belonging\u00a0 to the\u00a0 accused on the 1st, 2d and 3d of July.<br\/><br\/>The trial court further says:<br\/><blockquote>\"There can not be the slightest doubt or even\u00a0 a question about this defendant owning a\u00a0 carabao and cart that was driven by Macatangay\u00a0 hauling gravel and sand\u00a0 for the Lucena-Tayabas Road, for every witness, including both witnesses for defendant, swore this.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>We are unable to find the evidence upon which this statement rests.\u00a0 As we have repeatedly stated, the two witnesses for the defendant assert that during not one of the eleven days on which Macatangay worked on\u00a0 the Lucena-Tayabas Road was he driving a carabao and cart; but\u00a0 they assert, on the contrary, that he was working on each and every one of these eleven days as a day laborer for the Government in the gravel pit.\u00a0 Moreover, as we have repeatedly observed, the officials who certified Exhibit C state in such certificate that Emeterio Macatangay was not a driver of a cart and carabao on said road during any one of the days of July. It is true that it might be assumed from the evidence that the accused bought a carabao and cart from Felix Marasigan, but in this connection\u00a0 it must not be forgotten that he acquired that carabao and cait on the\u00a0 afternoon of the 11th day\u00a0 of\u00a0 July.\u00a0 At that time Macatangay\u00a0 had been working on five of\u00a0 the eight days on which it\u00a0 is alleged that he\u00a0 drove a carabao and cart for the accused.\u00a0 How is\u00a0 it possible that Macatangay could have driven a cart and carabao belonging to the accused on the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th of July when the accused did not\u00a0 own the carabao or have\u00a0 it in\u00a0 his possession until the 11th\u00a0 of July, according to the prosecution's own evidence?<br\/><br\/>But, as we\u00a0 have before observed, even if it be conceded that the\u00a0 accused owned the cart and carabao and that\u00a0 Emeterio Macatangay was driving it\u00a0 during\u00a0 the eight\u00a0 days as\u00a0 alleged by the prosecution, what does it\u00a0 signify?\u00a0 It nowhere appears in the evidence that the accused ever\u00a0 drew a\u00a0 dollar\u00a0 out of\u00a0 the\u00a0 public treasury for any services rendered by anybody except himself as road and bridge\u00a0 foreman.\u00a0 It does not appear that he recterio Macatangay.\u00a0\u00a0 Even if he were the owner of the cart and carabao, as\u00a0 stated,\u00a0 and Emeterio Macatangay drove it for eight days, as alleged,\u00a0 it is perfectly harmonious\u00a0 with reason and the evidence to say that the Government may have hired of the accused the cart and carabao and that the Government had employed Macatangay to drive it.\u00a0 There is absolutely no evidence in the case inconsistent with that theory.\u00a0 If that were the case,\u00a0 Macatangay\u00a0 would\u00a0 have been\u00a0 listed as a day laborer for the Government, and it is probable that neither one of the exhibits in the case would have shown the relation existing between the accused and the Government arising from\u00a0 this arrangement.<br\/><br\/>The learned trial court further says:<br\/><blockquote>\"Macatangay swore he only worked eleven days in July and was\u00a0 paid\u00a0 only by the Government for these eleven days, and the\u00a0 pay\u00a0 roll shows this payment.\u00a0 Defendant paid him\u00a0 nothing.\u00a0 He\u00a0 says he worked\u00a0 eight days driving a carabao and\u00a0 cart and three\u00a0 days at\u00a0 something else on the road,\u00a0 and was paid by the Government for all eleven days, snd that\u00a0 he drew the daily ration of rice furnished by the\u00a0 Government\u00a0 and thought he was working for the Government until he was questioned some time later.\u00a0 None of this\u00a0 is denied by the <i>capataz,<\/i> Canuto Manalo, in\u00a0 toto, but nearly all he says corroborates Macatangay.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>As we have before stated, we\u00a0 have been unable to find evidence in the\u00a0 record\u00a0 to support the allegation made in the last sentence of the above\u00a0 quotation.\u00a0\u00a0 A reference to the testimony of\u00a0 Canuto Manalo\u00a0 heretofore quoted in this opinion shows that he denied, directly and absolutely, the testimony of Macatangay.<br\/>In the same paragraph the trial court further says:<br\/><blockquote>\"<i>Capataz<\/i> Manalo\u00a0 said that Macatangay worked\u00a0 eleven days for the Government,\u00a0 which he\u00a0 put on the pay roll and\u00a0 says\u00a0 that he did work three days\u00a0 driving a carabao and cart for defendant, on the 1st, 2d, and 3d days of July, for which he presumed defendant paid Macatangay.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>As we have heretofore stated,<i> Capataz<\/i> Manalo did not testify that Mscatangay drove a carabao and cart belonging to the defendant on\u00a0 the 1st, 2d, and 3d\u00a0 days of July.\u00a0\u00a0 He testified simply that Macatangay \"drove a carabao and cart three days from the 1st\u00a0 of July.\u00a0\u00a0 Then he stopped.\u00a0 These<br\/>three days were the 1st, 2d, and 3d of July.\u00a0 I did not put that time down.\u00a0\u00a0 He did not work for the\u00a0 Government at the time.\u00a0 He worked for a <i>private man.\" <\/i> It is true\u00a0 that Manalo\u00a0 first testified that the accused paid Macatangay for services rendered during said three days, but being later asked by the attorney for the prosecution who paid\u00a0 Macatangay\u00a0 for the work thus performed on the\u00a0 three days referred to, the witness replied, \"I do not know who paid him.\"<br\/><br\/>There is\u00a0 no evidence\u00a0 whatever that the carabao which Macatangay is alleged to have\u00a0 driven\u00a0 on\u00a0 the\u00a0 1st, 2d and 3d days of\u00a0 July belonged to the accused,\u00a0 and\u00a0 there\u00a0 is no positive evidence that the accused paid him for such services.\u00a0 All there is in\u00a0 the record concerning this subject appears from the testimony quoted.\u00a0\u00a0 Macatangay himself expressly denies that he\u00a0 worked for the accused or anyone else during\u00a0 the first three days\u00a0 of July or that he drove a carabao and cart on the said days.\u00a0 He testified that he fell sick on\u00a0 the 1st day of July and was sick perhaps two weeks, more or less.\u00a0\u00a0 Here are\u00a0 some questions directed to Macatangay\u00a0 and\u00a0 his answers\u00a0 thereto.<br\/><blockquote>\"Q. When did you fall sick in the month of July? - A. I think the first day of July.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. How\u00a0 long\u00a0 were you sick?\u00a0 - A. Perhaps\u00a0 two weeks, more or less.<br\/>\"Q. When you were\u00a0 sick during these first two weeks in July, were\u00a0 you sick in\u00a0 bed\u00a0 or\u00a0 able\u00a0 to work? - A. I was unable to work the first two weeks in July.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>How\u00a0 then could he have worked on the 1st, 2d, and 3d of July?<br\/><br\/>Moreover, as we have repeatedly shown heretofore, the accused under the evidence of record, did not own a carabao and cart until 4 o'clock\u00a0 of the afternoon of Sunday, July 11.\u00a0 At the\u00a0 risk of repetition we again say that\u00a0 it is utterly impossible that Macatangay\u00a0 could have driven a\u00a0 carabao and cart belonging to\u00a0 the accused on the\u00a0 1st,\u00a0 2d, and 3d days of July when\u00a0 the accused,\u00a0 under the\u00a0 facts of record, did not\u00a0 own a carabao\u00a0 and cart\u00a0 at that time.<br\/><br\/>We have\u00a0 given this\u00a0 case\u00a0 careful consideration.\u00a0\u00a0 We do not believe the facts proved warrant the conviction.\u00a0\u00a0 The judgment of\u00a0 conviction\u00a0 is,\u00a0 therefore, reversed,\u00a0 the accused acquitted, and his immediate discharge from custody ordered. The sureties\u00a0 on his bail bond are released\u00a0 from responsibility thereunder, with costs <i>de oficio.<\/i><br\/><br\/><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Arellano, C.

that\u00a0 it\u00a0 was stipulated that each of the said purchasers should pay one-half of the price, or P22,\u00a0 and that an equal division should be made between them of the land thus purchased, situate in the place called Tangian, of the barrio of Dohinob, municipality of Dapitan, sub-district of the same name, Moro Province, and bounded on the north and east by the Tangian river, on the south and west by\u00a0 government forests, and containing:\u00a0 19.968 square\u00a0 meters, approximately,\u00a0 planted\u00a0 with\u00a0 200\u00a0 abaca plants; that, notwithstanding the demands he had repeatedly made upon the defendant to divide the said land, the latter, after having promised him on several occasions that he would make such partition, finally refused, without good reason, and still continued to refuse to divide the land\u00a0 and, moreover, without the knowledge and consent of the plaintiff, gathered the abaca crops of the years 1904, 1905 and 1906, produced on the land in question, and extracted the hemp therefrom in the amount of about 12 arrobas to each crop,\u00a0 he being the sole beneficiary of the fiber obtained that the plaintiff, relying upon the several promises made him by the defendant to\u00a0 divide the said land, took\u00a0 to the latter l,500 seeds to be planted in the part thereof which would have fallen to the plaintiff in the division,\u00a0 all of which seeds died, as an indirect result of the defendant's never having made the partition he offered to make; and, that since the year 1904, up to the time of the complaint, he alone had been paying the taxes on the land, without the defendant's having contributed to their payment.\u00a0 Therefore the plaintiff petitioned the court to render judgment in his favor by ordering a partition to be made\u00a0 of the\u00a0 said land through\u00a0 the mediation\u00a0 of\u00a0 commissioners appointed for the purpose,\u00a0 and by sentencing the defendant to pay to the plaintiff, as damages, the total value of the seed\u00a0 lost, amounting to P50, to restore to him one-half of the abaca harvested or the value thereof, and to the payment\u00a0 of the costs of the case.\u00a0 Defendant's counsel received a copy of this amended complaint.<\/p><p>The defendant, Ceferino Tabiliran, having\u00a0 been notified and summoned, in his answer to the preceding amended complaint denied each and all of the facts alleged in each and all of the paragraphs thereof and asked that\u00a0 he be absolved from\u00a0 the complaint,\u00a0 with the costs against the plaintiff.<\/p><p>After the hearing of the case and the production of oral evidence by the parties thereto, the court,\u00a0 on the 10th of the same month, rendered judgment by absolving the defendant from\u00a0 the\u00a0 complaint, with the costs\u00a0 against\u00a0 the plaintiff.\u00a0 Counsel for the latter excepted to this judgment and by a written motion\u00a0 asked\u00a0 for its annulment, and the holding of a new trial on the ground that\u00a0 the findings of the court were contrary to law.\u00a0 This motion was denied by an order of March 11, 1909, excepted to by the plaintiff's counsel, and the proper bill of exceptions having been duly filed, the same\u00a0 was certified and forwarded to\u00a0 the clerk of this court. <\/p><p>This\u00a0 suit concerns the\u00a0 partition of a piece of land held<em> pro indiviso<\/em>\u00a0 which the plaintiff\u00a0 and the\u00a0 defendant\u00a0 had acquired in common from its original owner.\u00a0 By the refusal of the defendant to divide the property, the plaintiff was compelled\u00a0 to bring the proper action for the enforcement of partition, referred to in sections 181 and following of the Code of Civil Procedure.<\/p><p>The\u00a0 record shows it to have been duly proved that Catalino Gallemit and Ceferino Tabiliran by mutual agreement acquired by purchase the land concerned, situate in Tangian, municipality of Dapitan, from its original owner, Luis Gandnong, for the sum of P44.\u00a0 It was stipulated between the purchasers that they each should pay one-half of the price\u00a0 and that the property\u00a0 should be\u00a0 divided equally between them.\u00a0\u00a0 The vendor testified under oath that\u00a0 the plaintiff Gallemit paid him\u00a0 the\u00a0 sum of P22, one-half\u00a0 of the price that it\u00a0 was incumbent upon him\u00a0 to\u00a0 pay,\u00a0 and that four months afterwards the defendant paid his part of the price, although,\u00a0 owing to\u00a0 the refusal of\u00a0 the defendant, who was then the justice of the peace of the pueblo, to comply with the stipulations made, the deed of sale was not executed, nor was a partition\u00a0 effected of the land which they had acquired. The defendant, instead of delivering\u00a0 to the plaintiff\u00a0 the share, that belonged to the latter, the proportionate price for which the plaintiff had already paid, kept all the land which belonged to them in common, in\u00a0 violation\u00a0 of\u00a0 the stipulations agreed upon, notwithstanding that he paid the vendor only one-half of the price thereof.<\/p><p>There is community of property when the ownership of a\u00a0 thing\u00a0 belongs to different persons undividedly.\u00a0\u00a0 (Art. 392, Civil Code.)\u00a0 No co-owner shall be obliged to remain a party\u00a0 to the community.\u00a0 Each\u00a0 of them may ask at any time the division of the thing owned in common.\u00a0\u00a0 (Art. 400 of the\u00a0 same code.)<\/p><p>Considering the terms of the claim made by the plaintiff and those of the defendant's answer, and the relation\u00a0 of facts contained in the judgment appealed from, it does not appear that any contract of partnership whatever was made between\u00a0 them for the purposes expressed in article 1665 of the Civil Code,\u00a0 for the sole transaction performed by them was the acquisition jointly by mutual agreement\u00a0 of the land in question, since\u00a0 it was undivided,\u00a0 under the condition that they each should pay one-half of the price thereof and that the property so acquired should be divided between the two purchasers; and as,\u00a0 under this title, the plaintiff\u00a0 and the defendant are the co-owners\u00a0 of\u00a0 the said land, the partition or division of such property held in joint tenancy must\u00a0 of course\u00a0 be allowed, and the present possessor\u00a0 of the land has no right to deny the plaintiff's claim on grounds or reasons unsupported by proof.<\/p><p>The\u00a0 circumstance of the plaintiff's inability to present any document whatever to prove that he\u00a0 and the defendant did actually purchase jointly the land in litigation can not be a successful defense in the action for partition, notwithstanding the provision contained in paragraph 5 of section 335 of the\u00a0 Code of Civil Procedure, inasmuch as the trial record\u00a0 discloses that testimony was adduced,\u00a0 unobjected to on the part of the defendant, to prove that the purchase was actually made by both litigants of the land in question from its original owner, Luis Ganong; furthermore, it was proved that after the contract was made the deed of sale was not drawn up on account of the opposition of the defendant, Tabiliran, to this being done, with the indubitable purpose, as has been seen, of his keeping the whole of the land purchased, though he paid but one-half\u00a0 of its\u00a0 price.<\/p><p>In the decision rendered in the case of Conlu et al. <em>vs.<\/em> Araneta and\u00a0 Guanko (15 Phil. Rep., 387), the following appears in the syllabus:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"The decisions in the cases of Thunga Chui <em>vs<\/em>. Que Bentec (2 Phil. Rep., 561) and Couto <em>vs.<\/em> Cortes\u00a0 (8 Phil. Rep., 459) followed to the extent of holding that \"an oral contract for the sale of real estate, made prior to the enactment of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions,\u00a0 is binding between the parties thereto.\"\u00a0\u00a0 The contract exists and is valid though it may not be clothed with the necessary form, and the effect of a noncompliance with the provisions of the statute (sec. 335 of\u00a0 the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions) is simply that no action can\u00a0 be proved unless the\u00a0 requirement is complied with; but a failure to except to the evidence because it does not conform with the\u00a0 statute, is a waiver of the provisions of the law.\u00a0 If the parties to the action, during the trial, made no objection to the admissibility of oral evidence to support the contract of sale of real property, thus permitting the contract\u00a0 to be\u00a0 proved, it\u00a0 will be just as binding upon the\u00a0 parties as if it had been reduced to writing.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>So that, once it\u00a0 has been\u00a0 proven by the testimony of witnesses that the purchase of a piece of real estate was made by a verbal contract between\u00a0 the\u00a0 interested parties, if the oral evidence was taken\u00a0 at the\u00a0 petition of one of them without opposition\u00a0 on the part of the other, such proven verbal\u00a0 contract, as the one herein concerned, must be held to be valid.\u00a0 On these premises it is, therefore, not indispensable that a written instrument be presented in order to prove a contract of purchase and sale of real estate; neither is it necessary,that the record show\u00a0 proof of a contract of partnership, in order that a demand may be made for\u00a0 the division of a real property acquired jointly and undividedly by two or\u00a0 more interested parties,\u00a0 inasmuch as the land was acquired by the two purchasers,\u00a0 not for the purpose of undertaking any business, nor for its cultivation in partnership, but solely to divide it equally between themselves. Therefore, it is sufficient to show proof of the fact that a real property was actually purchased by them jointly, in order to insure a successful issue of an action\u00a0 brought to enforce\u00a0 partition, in\u00a0 accordance with\u00a0 the provisions\u00a0 of sections\u00a0 181 to 196 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions, since the plaintiff is really a co-owner of the undivided land.<\/p><p>It is neither\u00a0 just nor permissible for the defendant to violate a contract made, even though verbally, with\u00a0 the plaintiff, and to keep without good reason, for his exclusive benefit and to the\u00a0 prejudice only of his co-owner,\u00a0 the plaintiff, the whole of the land belonging to both of them in common, because each paid a half of the value thereof.<\/p><p>\"Contracts shall be binding\/' prescribes\u00a0 article 1278 of the Civil Code,\u00a0 \"whatever may be the form in which they may have been\u00a0 executed,\u00a0 provided the essential conditions required for their validity exist.\"\u00a0 These\u00a0 conditions are enumerated in\u00a0 article 1261 of the same code, and they are also requisite in a verbal contract that has been proved.<\/p><p>As the plaintiff suffered damage through the\u00a0 loss of\u00a0 the seed which could\u00a0 not be\u00a0 planted in the part of the land belonging to him, on account of the refusal of the defendant to accede to a division of the property, in accordance with the agreement made, it is\u00a0 right and\u00a0 just\u00a0 that the latter be compelled to make\u00a0 indemnity for the amount of the damage occasioned through his fault.<\/p><p>With respect to the abaca obtained by the defendant, to his exclusive benefit, from the land of joint ownership: inasmuch as the amount and value of the fiber gathered is not shown in the trial record, there are no means available in law whereby a proper determination may be\u00a0 reached in the matter.<\/p><p>Therefore, we are of opinion that the judgment appealed from should be, as it is hereby, reversed.\u00a0 It is held to be proper to effect the partition of the land in question, and the judge\u00a0 of the\u00a0 Court of First Instance is directed to decree, through the proceedings prescribed by law, the division of the said land in conformity with the petition made by the plaintiff, and an indemnity, in behalf of the latter, in the sum of P50, the value of the seed lost.\u00a0 The delivery to the\u00a0 plaintiff of one-half of the abaca\u00a0 harvested on\u00a0 the land, or the value thereof, can not be ordered, on account of the\u00a0 lack of proof in the premises.\u00a0 No\u00a0 special finding is made as to costs.\u00a0 So ordered.<\/p><p><em>Mapa, Johnson, Carson,<\/em> and <em>Moreland, JJ<\/em>., concur.<\/p><\/div>",

Benito did not comply with this request so Estavillo paid said taxes on September 30th.<br\/><br\/>Mariano Erice testified that when he took\u00a0 the electors' oath he did not know that he was delinquent and that on finding out this fact he immediately paid his taxes.<br\/><br\/>Victor\u00a0 Fontanilla testified that he had been absent from Laoag working in the town\u00a0 of Vintar from May,\u00a0 1909, until the 1st of October of the same year; that when he left Laoag,he requested his wife to pay his land taxes but that she\u00a0 involuntarily\u00a0 failed to do so; that when he took the electors' oath\u00a0 he did not know that his land taxes had not been paid, and that on discovering this fact he immediately paid them.<br\/><br\/>Mateo Guerrero testified that before\u00a0 the end of August, 1909, he authorized and directed his nephew, Leoncio Guerrero, to pay his land taxes in the towns of Laoag, Baccra and\u00a0 Dingras, and for this purpose turned\u00a0 over to him the sum of P5; that after so doing\u00a0 he left for the Cagayan valley and\u00a0 did not return until the 28d day of September of that year, and feeling sure that his nephew had paid the taxes on his land he\u00a0 took the\u00a0 electors' oath; that he did\u00a0 not discover that he was delinquent until sometime in October and\u00a0 then he immediately\u00a0 paid his taxes.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 testimony of this\u00a0 defendant is corroborated by that of\u00a0 his nephew, Leoncio, with reference to having received the P5 and having promised\u00a0 to pay his uncle's taxes, but\u00a0 he\u00a0 said he did\u00a0 not comply with this request for the reason that his (Leoncio's father)\u00a0 was sick and he had to remain with him.<br\/><br\/>Elias Guieb testified\u00a0 that he paid his land taxes before the election and therefore\u00a0 considered\u00a0 himself\u00a0 a qualified elector, notwithstanding the fact that he was delinquent at the time he took the electors' oath.<br\/><br\/>Gregorio Ruiz stated that he did not\u00a0 know he was delinquent until he received, in the month of October, 1909, a notification from the municipal\u00a0 treasurer,\u00a0 and that on the receipt of this notification he paid his taxes.<br\/><br\/>Leandro Domingo, a municipal policeman, testified that he delivered, on the 4th of October, to Gregorio Ruiz a delinquent tax notice, issued by the municipal treasurer.<br\/><br\/>Leopoldo Tongson testified that when he took the electors' oath he did not consider himself delinquent for the reason that he had sold, with a right to repurchase, his lands to Alejandra Mena on the 28th of April, 1908; that since that sale he had considered himself not responsible for the taxes, as they had been assumed by Mena and paid by her in the year 1908; and that these lands still appear in the tax books in his name as he had not had an opportunity to have same transferred to Alejandra Mena.<br\/><br\/>Alejandra Mena testified that it is a fact that she had purchased\u00a0 the lands\u00a0 of Leopoldo Tongson,\u00a0 with a right to redeem, and had assumed the payment of the land taxes and that she\u00a0 did pay the land taxes for the year\u00a0 1908,\u00a0 but that she had not, up to the 24th of September, paid\u00a0 said taxes for the year 1909.<br\/><br\/>Andres\u00a0 Diego\u00a0 testified\u00a0 that he\u00a0 went to the\u00a0 provincial treasurer's office in Ilocos Norte in May or June, 1909, for the purpose of paying his land tax; that he paid\u00a0 certain of his taxes and received a\u00a0 receipt therefor and that he at that time asked the clerk in the treasurer's office whether or not he still owed other taxes and received a negative reply. Believing that\u00a0 he was not delinquent he took the electors' oath, but after doing so he discovered that he still owed a part of his taxes and he then proceeded immediately to pay them.<br\/><br\/>Leon Bruno testified that when he took the electors'\u00a0 oath he thought that his\u00a0 taxes had been\u00a0 paid as he had turned over the\u00a0 money\u00a0 to\u00a0 his nephew\u00a0 Alejandro Ricardo,\u00a0\u00a0 with instructions to pay his taxes;\u00a0 that being a laborer in\u00a0 the fields he fully believed same\u00a0 had been paid, but as soon as he discovered this mistake he paid these taxes.<br\/><br\/>Alejandro\u00a0 Ricardo's testimony was corroborative of\u00a0 the above.\u00a0 He stated that his\u00a0 uncle, Leon Bruno, upon\u00a0 the latter going away to harvest\u00a0 his palay, gave him the money to pay his taxes, but as the time for\u00a0 payment of the taxes had not then expired he involuntarily\u00a0 forgot to so pay them until the 27th of September,\u00a0 at which time they were paid.<br\/><br\/>Inocente Cayetano stated that he handed the money to pay his taxes to one Francisco Guerrero, with the request that he pay said taxes. Believing that his taxes had been fully paid by Guerrero he took the electors' oath.\u00a0 Upon learning that they had not been paid he made inquiries of Guerrero and was informed that he, Guerrero, had been taken ill and\u00a0 for that reason had\u00a0 been unable to attend to\u00a0 the\u00a0 matter and further testified that he then satisfied these taxes.<br\/><br\/>Francisco Guerrero, corroborating the last witness, testified that his uncle, Inocente Cayetano, had given him on the 22d of September more than &amp;5 for the payment of his taxes; that his uncle was very busy and had not the time to spare to attend to the matter;\u00a0 that the very day on which he received this money from his uncle he, Francisco, was taken ill and was unable to leave the house for the\u00a0 period of eight days; and that his uncle was engaged in working his lands and did not know of his, witness's illness.<br\/><br\/>Timoteo Mateo testified that during the past two years his lands had been in the possession of one Antonio Fontanilla, but that his, witness', name remained on the tax books. Believing that the taxes had been paid he took the electors' oath.\u00a0 Upon learning later that they had not, he proceeded immediately to\u00a0 pay them.<br\/><br\/>Esteban Lampitoc testified that he took the electors' oath before having paid his taxes, but that as he was later unable to satisfy said taxes he did not vote on election day.<br\/><br\/>Urbano Agcaoili testified that when he left Laoag in the month of August, 1909, he charged one Toribio Alvano with the payment of his taxes; that Alvano died\u00a0 in the.month of December of that year; that believing his taxes to have been paid by Alvano he took the electors' oath, and that later upon being informed of his delinquency he proceeded immediately to pay his taxes.<br\/><br\/>Gelacio Felipe testified that the real property upon which he is charged with not having paid the taxes is\u00a0 owned and possessed in common by himself and his two brothers; that it was the duty of his two brothers to pay the taxes on this land; that on account of his duties as a member of the insular police force it was impossible for him to attend\u00a0 to the payment of these taxes\u00a0 and that after receiving notice of his delinquency he did not vote.<br\/><br\/>The following questions are raised\u00a0 for determination:<br\/><ol type=\"1\"><li>Should the\u00a0 demurrer\u00a0 have been sustained upon the ground that more than one crime\u00a0 is charged in the complaint?<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>Was it incumbent upon the prosecution to show that the notices provided in section 18 of Act No. 1791 had been given to each of these defendants before it can be said that they were delinquent?<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>If the defendants were delinquent at the time they took the electors' oath, but paid their taxes before they voted, or did hot vote at all, are they guilty of having violated the Election Law?<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>Must the prosecution show that\u00a0 the defendants at the time they took the electors'\u00a0 oath did\u00a0 so knowing that they were delinquent, or is it presumed that they knew this\u00a0 fact?<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>If the latter is the rule, have the defendants made such a showing of good faith as\u00a0 to entitle them to an acquittal on the ground that\u00a0 they honestly believed they were not delinquent at the time they took the electors' oath?<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>Should subsidiary imprisonment have been imposed in accordance with the provisions of Act No. 1732?<\/li><\/ol>These questions will be passed upon in their order.

Any person who causes or attempts to cause his name to be\u00a0 registered, knowing that he is not a qualified voter in the district in which he registers, or who attempts to register, and any person who falsely represents himself as some other person to any election\u00a0 officer or\u00a0 board\u00a0 of registry, or who willfully gives a false answer relative to any matter relating to the registration\u00a0 of a voter\u00a0 or to the right of any person to vote, or who willfully aids or abets any other persons in doing any of the acts above mentioned, shall\u00a0 be\u00a0 punished by imprisonment for, not\u00a0 less\u00a0 than one month nor more than one year, or by a fine of not\u00a0 less than one hundred pesos, or more than five hundred pesos, or both, in the discretion of the court.\"<\/blockquote>The fourth\u00a0 paragraph\u00a0 defines and fixes the penalty for the crime of perjury committed in\u00a0 an\u00a0 election proceeding, and the sixth\u00a0 paragraph makes it a crime for anyone who causes or attempts to\u00a0 cause his name to be registered, knowing that he is\u00a0 not a qualified voter.<br\/><br\/>It is alleged in the\u00a0 complaint that\u00a0 the defendants\u00a0 did knowingly\u00a0 take and\u00a0 subscribe to a false oath\u00a0 and by\u00a0 so doing had their names illegally entered upon the\u00a0 registry of qualified voters.\u00a0 The\u00a0 other allegation shows what\u00a0 the defendants did to consummate this crime and that the false oath was material.\u00a0\u00a0 The defendants\u00a0 are charged with\u00a0 a single offense\u00a0 - the taking of a false oath in violation\u00a0 of section 30 of the Election Law - although\u00a0 in order to better establish the criminality of the defendants it became neces- sary for the prosecution to make a detailed statement of the various criminal acts committed by them.\u00a0 The allegation that the defendants caused their names to be entered upon the registry knowing that they were not qualified voters, might constitute, if standing alone, a separate offense, under paragraph 6,\u00a0 but in this case this allegation is used in a descriptive sense, describing or detailing the acts committed by the defendants, which, together with the other allegations, constitute the consummated crime of taking a false oath in violation of section 30 of the Election Law.\u00a0 No error, therefore, was committed in overruling the demurrer.<br\/><br\/>Sections 15,16,17, and 18 of Act No. 1791 are as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"SEC.\u00a0 15. The Governor-General shall, by executive order, upon recommendation\u00a0 of the provincial board, fix a term of three months in each year within which land taxes due the municipalities of the province shall be payable.\u00a0 Such executive order\u00a0 shall be issued\u00a0 before the thirty-first day of December of each year and at least three months before the beginning of the term during which such taxes shall be collected: <i>Provided, <\/i>That in\u00a0 case no action is taken by the provincial board and by the Governor-General the date fixed for the preceding year shall be held to be the date upon which the taxes shall be collected for the\u00a0 ensuing\u00a0 year. After such term is so fixed the provincial treasurer shall select a period of not less than one or more than three weeks during such term, within which said taxes shall be payable at the office of the provincial treasurer in the municipality, and such treasurer, or his deputy, shall attend and be present at said office\u00a0 during the usual office hours\u00a0 of each\u00a0 week during such period, exclusive of legal holidays, to receive payment of such taxes.\u00a0\u00a0 The provincial treasurer shall fix the time of collection in the municipality with a view to economy in the\u00a0 administration and discharge of his\u00a0 duties and the convenience of the taxpayers of\u00a0 the municipality: <i>Provided,<\/i> That\u00a0 in municipalities in which the municipal treasurer is a deputy of the provincial treasurer the\u00a0 collection period for each year shall cover the entire three months ending the day before the tax becomes delinquent.\u00a0 Notice of the dates during which said taxes may be paid in each municipality shall be posted\u00a0 by the provincial treasurer at the main entrance of the provincial building and\u00a0 of\u00a0 all municipal buildings and in a public and\u00a0 conspicuous\u00a0 place in each barrio.\u00a0\u00a0 Failure to pay the aforesaid taxes within the period specified shall subject the delinquent taxpayer to a penalty of twenty per centum of the amount of the original\u00a0 tax due, if\u00a0 paid\u00a0 within the first six months of delinquency, and a penalty of forty per centum of the original tax\u00a0 due if paid thereafter, to be collected at the\u00a0 same time and in the same manner a\u00bb the original\u00a0 tax, and the notice shall so state.\u00a0 The\u00a0 penalty shall be accounted for by the collecting officer in the same manner as the tax.<br\/><br\/>\"SEC.\u00a0 16.

So taxes and penalties assessed\u00a0 against realty have been declared to be a first mortgage\u00a0 or\u00a0 lien on such property. (Sec. 17, supra.)\u00a0 For the enforcement of\u00a0 this lien some regular procedure must be\u00a0 provided.\u00a0 At first a\u00a0 sufficient amount of the realty was sold at public auction to the highest and\u00a0 best bidder.\u00a0 This was found\u00a0 to be, in this country, against public policy.\u00a0 Finally, and lastly, it was thought best to have delinquent real property escheat to the Philippine Government; but before this can\u00a0 be done additional notices must be given.\u00a0\u00a0 These notices must \"clearly state the amount of the taxes due and the penalty which\u00a0 will be added if payment is made within six months from the delinquency, and the penalty which will be added if payment is made thereafter, together with a statement that at the expiration\u00a0 of one year from the date of delinquency, unless the tax and penalties be sooner paid, or the tax shall have been judicially set aside,\u00a0 the delinquent real property\u00a0 will be forfeited to the Government of the Philippine\u00a0 Islands.\" (Sec. 18,<i> supra.<\/i>)<br\/><br\/>We, therefore,\u00a0 conclude that the notices provided for in section 16,\u00a0 <i>supra, <\/i>are not required to be given for the purpose of constituting\u00a0 delinquency\u00a0 but for the purposes of enforcing the tax lien against the real property.<br\/><br\/>As to the third proposition, it is\u00a0 insisted that if the defendants had the qualifications specified in section 13 of Act No. 1582 at the time they took the\u00a0 electors' oath, they did not violate any of the provisions of the Election Law by reason of being delinquent in their taxes at that time.<br\/><br\/>Said section 13 provides as follows;<br\/><blockquote><i>\"SEC\u00a0 13.<\/i> Qualification of\u00a0 voters. - Every male\u00a0 person twenty-three years of age or over who has had a legal\u00a0 residence for\u00a0 a period of\u00a0 six\u00a0 months\u00a0 immediately preceding the election in the municipality in which he exercises the suffrage, and who is not a citizen or subject of any foreign power, and who is comprised\u00a0 within\u00a0 one of the following three classes - <br\/><br\/>(<i>a<\/i>)\u00a0 Those who, prior to the thirteenth of August, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight,\u00a0 held the office of municipal captain, gobernadorcillo, alcalde, lieutenant, cabeza de barangay, or member of any ayuntamiento;<br\/><br\/>\"(b) Those who own real property to the value of five hundred pesos, or who annually pay thirty pesos or more of the established taxes;<br\/><br\/>\"(c) Those who speak, read, and write Spanish or English - shall be entitled to\u00a0 vote at\u00a0 all elections: Provided, That officers, soldiers, sailors,\u00a0 or marines of the Army or Navy of the United States shall not be considered as having acquired legal residence within the meaning of this\u00a0 section by reason of their having\u00a0 been stationed\u00a0 in the municipalities for the required six months.\"<\/blockquote>The pertinent part\u00a0 of section 14 of the\u00a0 same Act is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Sec. 14.

If a person knowingly takes or subscribes any false oath, affidavit, or affirmation in these proceedings in relation to any\u00a0 <i>material matter<\/i>, he then and there commits\u00a0 the crime defined and punished in\u00a0 parargaph 4 of section 30 of the Election Law.\u00a0 And\u00a0 it makes no\u00a0 difference whether he actually voted or not.\u00a0 By desisting from voting will not blot\u00a0 out the crime\u00a0 already committed.\u00a0 If he\u00a0 commits the crime by having his name entered upon the registry he is still\u00a0 disqualified as a\u00a0 voter,\u00a0 and if\u00a0 he votes knowing\u00a0 this fact\u00a0 he commits another distinct and separate offense, which is that defined and\u00a0 penalized in the first paragraph\u00a0 of\u00a0 said section 30, and may be punished accordingly.<br\/><br\/>It\u00a0 is true that section 13, supra, provides that those\u00a0 who have the qualifications set forth therein \"shall be entitled to vote at all\u00a0 elections.\" This is\u00a0 a benefit\u00a0 or privilege extended to the\u00a0 people by the Government, but before they can\u00a0 exercise\u00a0 this privilege,\u00a0 or secure for themselves\u00a0 this benefit, they have certain duties to perform, one of which is to pay their taxes.\u00a0 One who fails or refuses to perform these duties can not and should not expect to reap those benefits.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the\u00a0 fourth question, it is incumbent upon the prosecution to show that the defendants were, in fact, delinquent in the payment of their taxes at the time they took the electors' oath; and when this has been done it\u00a0 must then be presumed that the defendants knowingly and intentionally took and subscribed the false oath.\u00a0 This rule was laid down by this court in the case of U. S.<i> vs.<\/i> Tria\u00a0 (17 PhiL Rep., 303).\u00a0 In\u00a0 this\u00a0 case the defendants were charged with a criminal violation of the Election Law, in that they voted in the general election held on the 2d of November, 1909, without having the qualifications required by law\u00a0 so to do.\u00a0 In\u00a0 passing\u00a0 upon the questions therein involved this court, among other things, said:<br\/><blockquote>\"Under the Election Law of these Islands,\u00a0 there is\u00a0 no presumption\u00a0 that anybody is entitled to vote.\u00a0\u00a0 In fact,\u00a0 the contrary presumption\u00a0 prevails.\u00a0 This\u00a0 presumption, taken in connection with the evidence of the prosecution,\u00a0 clearly and effectively\u00a0 established a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">prima facie<\/span> case against\u00a0 the appellants.\u00a0 Their conviction naturally and necessarily follows,\u00a0 unless\u00a0 they overcome the effect of the case made against them.\u00a0 In order to meet a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">prima facie<\/span> case, that is, in order to destroy its effect and shift the burden of producing further evidence, the party\u00a0 denying it must produce evidence tending to negative the claim asserted to a point where, if no more evidence be given, his adversary can\u00a0 not win by\u00a0 a preponderance\u00a0 of\u00a0 evidence in\u00a0 a civil\u00a0 case, and beyond a reasonable doubt in a criminal case.<br\/><br\/>\"Where the subject-matter of a negative averment in\u00a0 an indictment, or a-fact relied upon by defendant as a justification or excuse,\u00a0 relates to him personally or otherwise lies peculiarly within his knowledge, the general rule is that the burden of\u00a0 proof as to\u00a0 such averment or fact is on him.

He asserts,\u00a0 in other words, that, to\u00a0 sustain a conviction, it is necessary to prove not only that the appellants voted illegally but, in addition, that they voted knowing their lack of qualification.\u00a0 It is well\u00a0 known\u00a0 that a presumption of criminal intention may arise from proof of the commission of an\u00a0 unlawful act, it being the general rule that, if it is proved that the accused committed the unlawful act charged, it will be presumed that the act was done with a\u00a0 criminal intention, and that it is for the accused to rebut this\u00a0 presumption.\u00a0\u00a0 While there are certain\u00a0 crimes of which a specific intent to accomplish a particular purpose is an essential element\u00a0 and for which there can\u00a0 be\u00a0 no conviction\u00a0 upon proof of mere general malice or criminal intent,\u00a0 the case at bar does not fall within that class.\u00a0\u00a0 It is a\u00a0 well-settled principle that everyone is\u00a0 presumed\u00a0 to know\u00a0 the law of the land, and that one's ignorance of it furnishes no exemption from criminal responsibility for his acts.\u00a0\u00a0 The appellants, therefore, necessarily knew the law which prohibited them from voting unless they had the qualifications expressed in the\u00a0 law.\u00a0\u00a0 They\u00a0 knew\u00a0 also,\u00a0 and that\u00a0 far\u00a0 better\u00a0 than anyone else,\u00a0 whether or not they actually had those qualifications.\u00a0 The\u00a0 necessary\u00a0 consequence\u00a0 is that\u00a0 when\u00a0 they voted,\u00a0 they voted knowingly.\u00a0 They, being fully aware of their Jack of qualifications when they voted, may not now be heard to\u00a0 plead their ignorance.\u00a0 No one may be heard to plead ignorance of a fact which from the nature of things he must necessarily know better than\u00a0 anyone else.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The only\u00a0 difference\u00a0 between this case and\u00a0 the one at bar is in the fact that in the one the defendants were tried and convicted for having voted without possessing\u00a0 the necessary qualifications, while in the\u00a0 other\u00a0 they\u00a0 were tried and convicted for having knowingly taken and subscribed a false oath in election proceedings.<br\/><br\/>In each case the defendants\u00a0 were charged with having violated the provisions of the same law.\u00a0\u00a0 The same subject matter\u00a0 (that of elections)\u00a0 was\u00a0 involved in each case.\u00a0 He who votes, knowing that he does not possess the necessary qualifications, shall be\u00a0 punished,\u00a0 etc.\u00a0\u00a0 He who knowingly takes or subscribes any false oath shall also be punished, etc.\u00a0 The act of the one is of the same nature as that of the other.\u00a0\u00a0 They (the acts) relate to the same subject matter (elections)\u00a0 so\u00a0 the doctrine laid down in that case is equally applicable to the case now under consideration.<br\/><br\/>When the defendants in the case at bar took the electors' oath they swore that they were not delinquent in the payment of their taxes.\u00a0 They read, or had read to them, sections 13 and\u00a0 14 of the\u00a0 Election Law.\u00a0\u00a0 The provisions of these sections are clear, plain and easily understood.\u00a0 They admit of no\u00a0 explanation, they\u00a0 explain themselves.\u00a0 The defendants surely understood these plain and simple provisions of law.\u00a0 Each swore that: \"I have the qualifications of a voter,\u00a0 and\u00a0 none of\u00a0 the disqualifications prescribed in said sections.\"\u00a0 Not that I have been\u00a0 informed, but that I have or have not - a positive fact. To make doubly sure as to the payment of his taxes each also swore:\u00a0 \"I am\u00a0 not delinquent in the payment of\u00a0 any public taxes\u00a0 assessed against or due from me.\"\u00a0 This was the second time in\u00a0 the same oath that he swore he was not delinquent in the payment of his taxes.\u00a0\u00a0 As to whether or not he had actually paid his taxes at that time was a question of fact which\u00a0 lay peculiarly within his own knowledge.\u00a0 No one knew better than himself; he was the party most interested in the matter. There was no presumption that he was not delinquent; in fact, the contrary presumption\u00a0 prevailed.\u00a0 This presumption, taken in connection with the\u00a0 fact that\u00a0 he\u00a0 was delinquent, establishes his guilt of the crime charged, unless he has overcome, by competent proof,\u00a0 the effect of the case thus made out against him.\u00a0 In order\u00a0 to do this he must show that he had used every reasonable means\u00a0 within\u00a0 his power to ascertain whether or not his taxes had\u00a0 been paid. The best evidence of this fact is the tax\u00a0 receipt itself. But if\u00a0 the receipt is not presented he must produce other proof substantially as\u00a0 strong.\u00a0\u00a0 He can not\u00a0 substitute his oath for the\u00a0 mere statement or promise of\u00a0 another.\u00a0\u00a0 He must ascertain for himself.\u00a0 When he made application to have his name placed\u00a0 on the register as a qualified\u00a0 voter, he was seeking to exercise a privilege \"extended to him by the Government, a\u00a0 benefit, not an inherent right.\u00a0 This privilege or benefit was conditioned upon his performance of certain duties.\u00a0 He could not and should not expect to exercise such a privilege without performing his duty - in this case paying his taxes.\u00a0\u00a0 Then, again, taking the electors' oath was purely a voluntary act on his part.\u00a0 He could take it, or not, just as he choose. When it is admitted or shown, as in the case at bar, that the defendants committed the unlawful act (swearing that they were not delinquent, when in\u00a0 fact\u00a0 they were), it is presumed that they did so\u00a0 knowingly\u00a0 and\u00a0 intentionally. And when they seek\u00a0 to\u00a0 justify themselves by\u00a0 an excuse such an excuse must be reasonable and adequate.\u00a0 If it appears that they voluntarily closed their eyes to\u00a0 the\u00a0 truth, or negligently failed to make inquiry,\u00a0 then their ignorance or mistake of fact is not defense.<br\/><blockquote>\"It may fairly be assumed that one who has reason to believe\u00a0 a fact exists, knows it\u00a0 exists.\u00a0 Certainly if\u00a0 he be a reasonable being.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Shaw <i>vs<\/i>. Railroad Co., 101\u00a0 U.\u00a0 S., 557.)<br\/><\/blockquote>Each one of the defendants presented what he now claims to be a justifiable excuse\u00a0 for the commission of this crime; They pretend that they did not know\u00a0 that their taxes\u00a0 had not been paid.\u00a0 They\u00a0 are reasonable\u00a0 beings\u00a0 and not only had\u00a0 reason\u00a0 to believe\u00a0 that their taxes had not been paid, but they were in a position to know this fact.\u00a0\u00a0 Not a\u00a0 single one made any inquiries to ascertain whether or not his taxes had\u00a0 been paid, but he took the electors'\u00a0 oath in which he swore positively that they had been.\u00a0\u00a0 If they\u00a0 had exercised due diligence, or had used all reasonable means within their power,\u00a0 they could\u00a0 have easily\u00a0 ascertained that\u00a0 they were delinquent.\u00a0 It would have been\u00a0 so simple\u00a0 and\u00a0 easy for them to have inquired of the municipal or provincial treasurer with reference to this fact and to have obtained the correct information.\u00a0 Each would have\u00a0 been informed by the treasurer that he Was delinquent.\u00a0\u00a0 There\u00a0 will rarely,\u00a0 if ever, be\u00a0 a case where this information can not\u00a0 be\u00a0 obtained in this manner.\u00a0 The excuses presented by these defendants fall far short of being sufficient to relieve them of criminal responsibility.\u00a0 If such flimsy excuses are accepted by the courts, then that part of the statute\u00a0 (par. 4, sec. 30 of the Election Law) becomes practically a dead letter\u00a0 The expressed will of the Legislature should not be frittered away in such a manner.\u00a0 Solemn oaths should be taken seriously. These defendants called upon God to witness the truthfulness of their statements when they took\u00a0 the\u00a0 electors' oath and at the same time voluntarily closed their eyes to the truth. They can not now be heard to\u00a0 say that they did not know they were committing this crime.\u00a0 In accordance with the very plainest principles of justice they must suffer the consequences of these\u00a0 acts.\u00a0 The Legislature has\u00a0 so declared and we must obey this\u00a0 mandate by imposing upon the defendants the corresponding\u00a0 penalty;\u00a0 first, because they deserve to be\u00a0 punished, and second, in order to deter others from committing the same crime.<br\/><br\/>The last paragraph of section 30 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 Election Law provides that -<br\/><blockquote>\"Whenever any person shall be convicted of\u00a0 an offense under this Act, the fine and costs imposed, if any, shall be extinguished by\u00a0 imprisonment at the rate of one day's imprisonment for each two pesos of fine or costs remaining unpaid.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>This Act went\u00a0 into effect on January 9, 1907, and on the 1st day of October, 1907, Act No. 1732\u00a0 was passed.\u00a0 The first section\u00a0 of this Act\u00a0 provides as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"When a fine\u00a0 is imposed\u00a0 as a whole or any part of the punishment\u00a0 for\u00a0 any criminal offense made\u00a0 punishable\u00a0 by any Act or Acts of the Philippine Commission, the court shall also sentence the guilty person to suffer subsidiary imprisonment until the fine is satisfied:\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.<br\/><br\/>\"(<i>a<\/i>)\u00a0 The term of such subsidiary imprisonment shall be calculated at the rate of two pesos and fifty centavos\u00a0 per day\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *.<br\/><center><br\/>*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*<br\/><\/center> <br\/>\"(<i>c<\/i>)\u00a0 In case the sentence of the court merely imposes a fine, the\u00a0 subsidiary imprisonment\u00a0 shall\u00a0 not exceed\u00a0 six months.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>No provision is made in this Act for subsidiary imprisonment in case of failure to pay the\u00a0 costs.\u00a0 The\u00a0 term \"by any Act or Acts of the Philippine\u00a0 Commission\"\u00a0 is clear and positive.\u00a0 It was intended to repeal\u00a0 any other provisions to the contrary in any and all acts of the Commission. That provision of the\u00a0 Act imposing subsidiary\u00a0 imprisonment in case of failure to pay a fine is\u00a0 penal in its nature. It is more favorable to the defendants\u00a0 than the last paragraph of section\u00a0 30\u00a0 of the Election Law above quoted.<br\/><br\/>For these reasons the judgment appealed from is affirmed:<br\/><br\/>Provided, however, That in\u00a0 case of insolvency in the payment of the fine the subsidiary imprisonment shall be at the rate of two pesos and fifty centavos\u00a0 per day, not including costs.\u00a0 Costs in this instance will be taxed against the appellants.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Johnson, Carson,<\/i> and <i>Moreland, JJ.,<\/i> concur.<br\/><\/div>",

That\u00a0 about\u00a0 eight or nine years ago,\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendants constructed on the plaintiff's land a camarin or warehouse made of old galvanized iron and other second-hand material, as\u00a0 shown in\u00a0 the\u00a0 photograph, Exhibit C,\u00a0 as No. 2, and erected on that part of the plaintiff's land that is indicated in the rough sketch, Exhibit B, as No. 3;<br\/><br\/>\"4. That\u00a0 the true boundary line of the northern part of the plaintiff's land is that given as\u00a0 \"4\u00a0 to 6\"\u00a0 in the rough sketch,\u00a0 Exhibit B, and within which boundary is\u00a0 included the aforementioned warehouse constructed\u00a0 by the\u00a0 defendants;<br\/><br\/>\"5. That\u00a0 the said\u00a0 defendants refused to remove the said warehouse from the place before cited, after a demand had been made\u00a0 upon them so to do, and, instead, alleged that they owned\u00a0 the land on which it is built;<br\/><br\/>\"6. That,\u00a0 owing to the form of\u00a0 construction of\u00a0 the roof of the said\u00a0 warehouse, the water shed by\u00a0 this roof\u00a0 falls against the\u00a0 wall of the\u00a0 plaintiff's house\u00a0 and has thereby caused him\u00a0 damage to the extent of P100;<br\/><br\/>\"7. That the just and reasonable rental for the plaintiff's parcel of land, illegally occupied by the defendants during eight years,\u00a0 is two pesos for each month, or, for the period of eight years, P192.<br\/><br\/>\"Therefore, this court\u00a0 is of the opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to\u00a0 a\u00a0 judgment\u00a0 against the defendants for the recovery of the\u00a0 ownership and possession\u00a0 of the land in question as\u00a0 described\u00a0 in the complaint and shown in the plan; Exhibit B,\u00a0 and for damages in the sum of P292, with the costs, moreover, against the defendants.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>From this judgment, rendered on\u00a0 August\u00a0 3, 1909, the defendants appealed\u00a0 and\u00a0 also moved for a new trial, which motion was\u00a0 denied by the\u00a0 court and the record\u00a0 does\u00a0 not show that the defendants took any exception to such ruling.<br\/><br\/>The latter filed a bill of exceptions with this court wherein they made five assignments of error; but in\u00a0 view of\u00a0 the provisions of the law, it does not lay within the power of this court in\u00a0 the present case, to review the evidence,\u00a0 the conclusion upon\u00a0 which, by the lower court, is argued in the specification of the errors alleged against the judgment appealed from.<br\/><br\/>Pursuant to section\u00a0 497,\u00a0 paragraph 3, of the\u00a0 Code of Civil Procedure now\u00a0 in force, if the excepting party files a motion in the Court of First Instance for a new trial upon the ground that the findings of fact are plainly and manifestly against the weight of evidence, and the\u00a0 judge\u00a0 overrules the\u00a0 motion, and\u00a0 due exception\u00a0 is taken, the Supreme Court may review the\u00a0 evidence, make such findings\u00a0 upon the facts and render\u00a0 such\u00a0 final judgment as\u00a0 justice and equity may require.\u00a0 The appellant not having taken exception to the denial of his motion for a new trial, this\u00a0 court ought not to review the evidence adduced in first\u00a0 instance nor could it\u00a0 do so in the present case, though it\u00a0 required review, owing to the failure to bring up the\u00a0 evidence pursuant to the provision of law above quoted, and\u00a0 must accept the findings of fact established by the trial court and only examine the\u00a0 direct application of the findings of law,\u00a0 on which the judgment rests, to the facts that\u00a0 were proved. This examination having been made, it is our opinion that the judgment accords with the facts found by\u00a0 the learned Court of First Instance to have been proved, and\u00a0 that the conclusions based thereon are in agreement with the provisions of law governing the matter at\u00a0 issue.<br\/><br\/>We therefore affirm\u00a0 that\u00a0 judgment, with the\u00a0 costs\u00a0 of this\u00a0 instance against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i> Torres, Johnson, Moreland,<\/i> and <i>Trent, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><\/div>",

Taking into consideration the conflict of evidence\u00a0 and also the fact, which\u00a0 we regard as of considerable importance, that, prior to the sales and services involved in suit, there had never been a meeting of the stockholders of the corporation, that no officers had ever been elected, that no one had ever\u00a0 been authorized to act\u00a0 for said corporation and that if the defendant\u00a0 was acting as agent for the\u00a0 corporation he was an official <em>de facto<\/em> and\u00a0 not <em>de jure<\/em>, we\u00a0 are constrained to the conclusion that we would not be warranted in disturbing the conclusion of the trial court.<\/p><p>The judgment\u00a0 of the court below\u00a0 is\u00a0 affirmed, without special finding as\u00a0 to costs.<\/p><p><em>Torres, Mapa, Johnson,<\/em> and <em> Carson, JJ<\/em>., concur.<\/p><\/div>",

J. S. Powell\u00a0 presiding,\u00a0 awarding the possession of\u00a0 the lands\u00a0 described in the\u00a0 complaint to the plaintiff, with costs.<br\/><br\/>The action\u00a0 is brought by Simon Malahacan as administrator of\u00a0 the goods, chattels, and\u00a0 credits of Guillerma Martinez, deceased, against the defendants, the only heirs at law of the said deceased, to recover possession of the real estate of which the said Guillerma Martinez died\u00a0 seized, which said real estate the defendants had been occupying for some years before the commencement of this action.<br\/><br\/>Under the provisions of the Civil Code\u00a0 the ownership\u00a0 of real estate passes to the heirs of the owner instantly on his death.\u00a0\u00a0 Guillerma Martinez, having died seized of the lands involved in this suit, leaving the defendants as her only heirs at law, it follows that said heirs instantly became the owners and were entitled to the immediate possession thereof.\u00a0\u00a0 It is not alleged\u00a0 in the complaint nor does it appear from the record or the\u00a0 evidence in this case that\u00a0 there were debts outstanding against Guillerma Martinez at the time of her death.\u00a0\u00a0 The only ground upon which an administrator can demand of the heirs at law possession of\u00a0 the real estate\u00a0 of which his intestate died seized is that such land will\u00a0 be required to\u00a0 be sold to pay the debts of the\u00a0 deceased.\u00a0\u00a0 In the case of\u00a0 Ilustre, administrator of the\u00a0 estate of the deceased Calzado, <i>vs.<\/i> Alaras Frondosa\u00a0 (17\u00a0 Phil. Rep., 321), this court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"Under the\u00a0 provisions of the Civil Code (arts. 657-661), the rights to the succession of a person are\u00a0 transmitted from the moment of his death; in other words, the heirs succeed immediately to all of the property of the deceased ancestor. The property belongs to\u00a0 the\u00a0 heirs at the moment of the death of the ancestor as completely as if the ancestor had executed and delivered to them a deed for the same before his death.\u00a0 In the\u00a0 absence of debts existing\u00a0 against the estate, the heirs may enter upon the administration of the said property immediately.\u00a0 If they desire to administer it jointly, they may do so.\u00a0 If they desire to partition it among themselves and can do this by mutual agreement, they also have that privilege.\u00a0\u00a0 The Code of Procedure in Civil Actions provides how an estate may be divided by\u00a0 a petition for partition in case they can not mutually agree in the division. When there are no\u00a0 debts existing\u00a0 against the estate, there is certainly no occasion for the intervention of an administrator\u00a0 in the settlement and partition of the estate among the heirs.\u00a0 When the heirs are all of lawful\u00a0 age and there are no debts,\u00a0 there is no reason why the\u00a0 estate should be burdened with the costs and expenses of an\u00a0 administrator. The property belonging absolutely to the heirs, in the absence of existing debts against the estate, the administrator has no right to intervene in any way whatever in the\u00a0 division of the estate among the heirs.\u00a0 They are co-owners of an undivided estate\u00a0 and the law\u00a0 offers them a remedy\u00a0 for the\u00a0 division of the same among themselves.\u00a0 There is nothing in the present case to show\u00a0 that the heirs requested the appointment of\u00a0 the administrator, or that they intervened in any way whatever in the present action.\u00a0 If there are any heirs of the estate who have not received their participation, they have their remedy\u00a0 by petition for partition of\u00a0 the\u00a0 said estate.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The\u00a0 judgment appealed from is reversed\u00a0 and the complaint\u00a0 dismissed on the merits, without special finding as to costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa, Johnson,<\/i> and <i>Carson, JJ.,<\/i> concur.<br\/><\/div>",

At the said hearing, from among those defendants only the girl Encarnacion, then under age, appeared, assisted by a <i>curator ad litem,<\/i> and the trial was continued in the absence and default of the other four, Agapito, Honorato, Perfecto, and Guagerico.\u00a0\u00a0 On May 1, 1907, the court rendered judgment against the\u00a0 defendants,\u00a0 directing them\u00a0 to pay to Saturnina de Leon, as the administratrix of the estate of the deceased Rufino Tongoy, P2,300.30, with legal\u00a0 interest from the\u00a0 date of the filing of the complaint and the costs of\u00a0 the\u00a0 suit.\u00a0 On November\u00a0 4,\u00a0 1907, the sheriff\u00a0 sold the mortgaged property at public\u00a0 auction, and it was adjudicated to the plaintiff's lawyer, Jose Felix Martinez.<br\/><br\/>On November 6,\u00a0 1907,\u00a0 some\u00a0 work animals, belonging to Agapito Hinlo and\u00a0 others of\u00a0 the defendants,\u00a0 that had been attached by Saturnina de\u00a0 Leon, were sold at auction by the sheriff.\u00a0\u00a0 In\u00a0 the\u00a0 return of the sale it\u00a0 was stated that \"the total amount of the said\u00a0 sale was P2,638 only for the 11 carabaos and 23\u00a0 cows of\u00a0 all\u00a0 kinds as shown in the inventory.\"\u00a0\u00a0 It was\u00a0 likewise stated\u00a0 in\u00a0 the return that, as the amount received from the sale exceeded\u00a0 that of the\u00a0 judgment, other animals that\u00a0 had been attached were not sold and were\u00a0 returned\u00a0 to Agapito\u00a0 Hinlo, and that the sheriff also delivered to the latter\u00a0 P33.93,\u00a0 as\u00a0 surplus\u00a0 over the amount collected on the judgment.<br\/><br\/>The foregoing facts are connected with the case decided under No. 168 of the docket.<br\/><br\/>The following facts are those alleged in the present suit, No. 326, the result of the complaint filed by Agapito Hinlo against Saturnina de Leon and the sheriff for the recovery of possession of the said animals whicfy the latter two parties had attached and sold:\u00a0 (1) That notwithstanding the protest made and notice of intervention given by Agapito Hinlo to the sheriff, the latter proceeded with the attachment of the said animals, under bond given by Saturnina de Leon; (2) that the attached animals were the personal and exclusive\u00a0 property\u00a0 of\u00a0 Agapito Hinlo,\u00a0 and not property left by his deceased parents, nor by the latter's heirs; (3)\u00a0 that on\u00a0 October 21,\u00a0 1907, before the\u00a0 said\u00a0 animals were\u00a0 sold, Agapito Hinlo filed\u00a0 suit to have\u00a0 them declared to be his exclusive property and\u00a0 be restored to him,\u00a0 or should\u00a0 they be sold that he be paid\u00a0 their value as well as an indemnity for the resultant loss and damage, and the costs.<br\/><br\/>These facts of the complaint in\u00a0 this case\u00a0 having\u00a0 been established, the defendant sheriff did not appear to answer the complaint\u00a0 and was declared in default.\u00a0\u00a0 The defendant Saturnina de\u00a0 Leon\u00a0 appeared and made a general denial, and as her special defense established the following facts: (1) that against the judgment in case No. 168, the\u00a0 then defendants, among them the present plaintiff, Agapito Hinlo, did not avail themselves of any of the legal remedies the law grants to\u00a0 those sentenced by default, and. consented to the judgment,\u00a0 which on this\u00a0 account became final;\u00a0 (2) that,\u00a0 after the judgment had become final,\u00a0 the sheriff attached and sold at public auction property that was subject to an execution of judgment;\u00a0 that Agapito Hinlo, by his acts and in writing,\u00a0 gave his consent and agreement to the auction sale of the property attached and sold as a result of that execution.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff,\u00a0 Agapito Hinlo, presented as\u00a0 proof of his exclusive right in the\u00a0 animals claimed in\u00a0 this\u00a0 action of intervention the ownership titles which he possessed;\u00a0 and, after\u00a0 the production of oral and documentary\u00a0 evidence by both\u00a0 sides, the court rendered its judgment\u00a0 in which it made, among others, the following findings of facts:<br\/><blockquote>\"6.\u00a0 Thev also attached the carabaos and other cattle specified in the\u00a0 complaint in this case and\u00a0 which\u00a0 were the exclusive and private property of\u00a0 Agapito Hinlo, acquired subsequent to the death of his parents, as fully proven by the plaintiff's oral and documentary evidence.<br\/><br\/>\"7. It was also proved that the only property which Agapito Hinlo's\u00a0 parents\u00a0 left at their\u00a0 death\u00a0 were the\u00a0 thirty hectares of land, and if they left any\u00a0 carabaos it was not sufficiently proven who\u00a0 took\u00a0 control\u00a0 of\u00a0 them, for when Agapito Hinlo's parents died all their children were minors, though it\u00a0 is\u00a0 probable that the animals died of old age or of' the\u00a0 first\u00a0 epidemic of\u00a0 rinderpest that\u00a0 occurred\u00a0 in\u00a0 this province.<br\/><br\/>\"8. It has\u00a0 likewise\u00a0 been proved\u00a0 that no partition whatever was\u00a0 made of the estate left\u00a0 by\u00a0 Esteban Hinlo\u00a0 and Nicasia Jamandre, and that\u00a0 Agapito\u00a0 Hinlo\u00a0 has not yet received any share whatever of the inheritance left by his parents; and it was not established by any evidence whatever that\u00a0 Agapito\u00a0 Hinlo\u00a0 and\u00a0 his brothers and sister\u00a0 had formally acquired their parents' estate.<br\/><br\/>\"9. The attachment, of\u00a0 the\u00a0 private\u00a0 property of Agapito Hinlo, was therefore arbitrary, especially as notwithstanding the action of\u00a0 intervention\u00a0 brought, they sold at auction, (the required bond having been given by Saturnina de Leon as the legal administratrix of the estate of her deceased husband, Rufino Tongoy), eleven carabaos and twenty-three cows\u00a0 for\u00a0 the sum\u00a0 of\u00a0 P2,638,\u00a0 returning to\u00a0 Agapito\u00a0 Hinlo three carabaos and five head\u00a0 of cattle, on account of the amount obtained\u00a0 from the auction sale\u00a0 exceeding that ordered to be collected in the writ of execution, and an overplus of P33.93.<br\/><br\/>\"The conclusion, then, is that the herein plaintiff, Agapito Hinlo, is the sole owner of the animals attached\u00a0 and sold, that they never belonged to his parents, and that it was not proved that he inherited anything whatever from the latter at their death.\"<\/blockquote>The judgment was\u00a0 in plaintiff's favor, the court finding therein that the personal property claimed was the exclusive and private property of Agapito Hinlo, and sentencing, as a result of that finding, Saturnina de Leon, as the administratrix of the estate of the deceased Rufino Tongoy, to pay to Agapito Hinlo the sum of P2,119.26, besides the interest thereon at the rate of 6 per cent per annum since the property was\u00a0 attached,\u00a0 that is, since July 16, 1907, for loss and damage, such interest to run until the total reimbursement of the\u00a0 said sum should be made, and\u00a0 to pay the costs of the trial.<br\/><br\/>The defendant Saturnina de Leon appealed, and a bill of exceptions with right to\u00a0 a review of the evidence having been forwarded to\u00a0 this court, the following assignments of error were presented by the appellant:<br\/><br\/>The lower court erred:<br\/><ol><li>In admitting evidence on the point as to whether Agapito Hinlo did or did not inherit property from his deceased parents.<\/li><li>In admitting\u00a0 evidence\u00a0 with respect to whether\u00a0 the parents of Agapito Hinlo did or did not leave property which the latter inherited.<\/li><li>In finding\u00a0 in its last judgment, that the previous\u00a0 one rendered\u00a0 in case No. 168 was\u00a0 based on the sole testimony of Manuel Lopez.<\/li><li>In holding\u00a0 that the\u00a0 judgment\u00a0 rendered by\u00a0 default against Agapito Hinlo in case No. 168 did not affect this one nor produce against him the effects of <i>res judicata. <\/i><\/li><\/ol>Other assignments of error are alleged which are omitted in this decision.<br\/><br\/>This case concerns a\u00a0 debt of the spouses Esteban Hinlo and Nicasia Jamandre,\u00a0 secured by a mortgage on a rural property.<br\/><br\/>Action was\u00a0 brought to recover this debt, the rural property mortgaged was attached and, in execution of judgment, sold at public auction, the complaint being filed against\u00a0 the children of\u00a0 the\u00a0 said spouses and\u00a0 against\u00a0 whom the trial proceeded by default.<br\/><br\/>But afterwards other property, not mortgaged, some work animals, was attached.<br\/><br\/>One of the children claimed these animals as exclusively his own and as property which should not have been included in that execution.<br\/><br\/>The hereditary succession of the debtors, Hinlo and Jamandre,\u00a0 was opened in 1890 and 1897, the dates when they each died.<br\/><br\/>All the children left by these spouses were then\u00a0 under age, the\u00a0 eldest of them, Agapito Hinlo, being 19 years old in 1897.<br\/><br\/>The hereditary succession having been opened in 1897, the date\u00a0 of the last death, that is, that of Nicasia Jamandre, the rights and obligations contained in the said succession can not be governed by other legislation than that then and now in force, the Civil Code.<br\/><br\/>In accordance with the principles of the Civil Code, legitimate children are the heirs of their parents, by operation of law.\u00a0\u00a0 (Arts. 807, 931.)<br\/><br\/>But not because a person is an heir of another is he bound to pay the latter's debts; he is only bound to pay them if he accepts the\u00a0 inheritance; so that the acceptance of the inheritance is what renders the heir liable for the debts of his predecessor in interest.\u00a0\u00a0 The acceptance is either pure and simple,\u00a0 or under benefit of inventory.\u00a0 (Art. 998.)<br\/><blockquote>\"Art.\u00a0 1003.

(4) that the fact that the said children consented to the judgment in so far\u00a0 as concerned the\u00a0 sale of\u00a0 the property mortgaged by their parents\u00a0 does not mean that they\u00a0 also agree to pay\u00a0 all\u00a0 shortage\u00a0 not covered\u00a0 by the amount realized from\u00a0 such\u00a0 sale,\u00a0 especially\u00a0 if, besides\u00a0 the mortgaged property,\u00a0 they\u00a0 have\u00a0 not\u00a0 received,\u00a0 preserved, or\u00a0 administered\u00a0 other property of their parents'\u00a0 estate; (5) that if the parents left other property not acquired or accepted as an inheritance by these children, no action can be maintained against the latter\u00a0 with a view of bringing such property under execution, as they have not contracted any personal obligation\u00a0 with\u00a0 regard\u00a0 to\u00a0 it,\u00a0 not\u00a0 having received it as an inheritance;\u00a0 (6)\u00a0 that, in an identical case, judgment\u00a0 could\u00a0 only be\u00a0 enforced\u00a0 against\u00a0 them\u00a0 for the recovery of an amount equal to the\u00a0 value of the said property, if they\u00a0 had acquired or accepted it as an inheritance, but not a greater amount, it being unlawful to\u00a0 levy\u00a0 upon their own property in execution of judgment, inasmuch as, according to law, since they were minors in 1897, they could receive such\u00a0 inherited property in\u00a0 no other manner\u00a0 than under\u00a0 benefit of inventory, and the benefit of\u00a0 inventory is for the purpose of avoiding a confusion of the heir's own property with that of his predecessor in interest which he has inherited.<br\/><br\/>If under these substantive\u00a0 provisions of the Civil Code, under\u00a0 which the mortgage action of the creditor,\u00a0 Rufino Tongoy, should have been brought,\u00a0 the\u00a0 children\u00a0 of the spouses Hinlo and Jamandre\u00a0 should only have been called upon to deliver the mortgaged property;\u00a0 no personal liability whatever rested upon the said children,\u00a0 as none was transmitted to them; the action brought partaking of the character\u00a0 of\u00a0 a real action, greater still, in the light of the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, is\u00a0 the evidence of the\u00a0 illegal nature\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 procedure of extending the mortgage\u00a0 action\u00a0 to cover property which in no\u00a0 wise is shown\u00a0 to\u00a0 have been\u00a0 left\u00a0 by those debtors, but which appeared\u00a0 by legitimate and unassailable titles to belong exclusively to Agapito Hinlo; even if it really had been left by the\u00a0 said debtors,\u00a0 execution could not have been levied thereon in the manner that it was, against the legitimate protests of its true owner and possessor.<br\/><blockquote><i>\"Mortgage debt due from estate<\/i>\" is the caption of\u00a0 section 708 of\u00a0 the Code of Civil Procedure, which provides:<br\/><br\/>\"A creditor holding a claim against the deceased, secured by mortgage or other collateral security, may abandon the security and prosecute his claim before the committee, and share in the general distribution of the assets of the estate; or he may foreclose his mortgage or realize upon his security,\u00a0 by ordinary action in court, making the executor or administrator a party defendant.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Rufino\u00a0 Tongoy could choose between\u00a0 his\u00a0 personal right and his real right;\u00a0 he could, by renouncing his real security, present his claim before\u00a0 the committee\u00a0 which would\u00a0 have been appointed in the probate proceeding on the estate of the spouses Hinlo and Jamandre, or he could have brought, in a separate trial, the proper action for the collection of his mortgage credit or to realize upon his security, making the executor or administrator a party defendant.\u00a0 He chose this\u00a0 last alternative, but he did not sue an executor or administrator of the estate of Hinlo and Jamandre.<br\/><blockquote>\"If there is a judgment for a deficiency,\"\u00a0 continues the section above quoted, \"after the sale of the mortgaged premises, or the property pledged,\u00a0 in the foreclosure or other proceeding to realize upon the security, he may prove his deficiency judgment, before the committee against the estate of the deceased; or he may rely upon his mortgage or other security alone, and foreclose the same at any time, within the period of the statute\u00a0 of limitations, and\u00a0 in that event he shall not be admitted as a creditor, and shall receive no share in the\u00a0 distribution of the other assets of the\u00a0 estate.\"<\/blockquote>After the sale\u00a0 of the mortgaged\u00a0 property, the widow of Tongoy did\u00a0 not\u00a0 endeavor to obtain a\u00a0 judgment\u00a0 for\u00a0 the amount which remained unpaid, and she limited her action to a demand that the sheriff attach and\u00a0 sell the\u00a0 animals which she supposed to belong to the debtors, and the sheriff attached and sold them,\u00a0 which acts\u00a0 of\u00a0 both parties were entirely illegal.\u00a0 With the judgment, which it was necessary for her to have previously obtained, she could have applied to the committee\u00a0 to take\u00a0 into\u00a0 account her claim against the estate\u00a0 as one of the personal credits\u00a0 against the same; this she\u00a0 did not do,\u00a0 but\u00a0 through the sheriff she continued to enforce the execution\u00a0 of\u00a0 the judgment by levying upon some\u00a0 animals owned by Agapito Hinlo, thus violating the provisions of the law and thereby radically vitiating the proceedings\u00a0 had,\u00a0 which were, moreover, an infringement of the particular rights of a third party.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 judgment appealed from\u00a0 is,\u00a0 therefore, perfectly proper and\u00a0 is hereby\u00a0 affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa, Johnson,<\/i> and <i>Moreland, JJ.,<\/i> concur.<br\/><\/div>",

Levy Brothers, as the balance of my account with them to date, payable in partial payments.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The defendant made several partial payments and later claimed\u00a0 the\u00a0 right to establish, as a fixed rate\u00a0 for\u00a0 future payments, the installment of P30 a month. The plaintiffs, disagreeing with\u00a0 such a claim,\u00a0 brought suit against the defendant and asked that the latter be sentenced to pay them the sum of P5,862.35, the unpaid\u00a0 balance, or\u00a0 that a period be specified within which he should pay the same, in case the court should deem such manner of\u00a0 payment more equitable. Moreover, the plaintiffs demand in their complaint the sum of P355, which they claim the defendant owes them\u00a0 upon a\u00a0 debt. <br\/><br\/>The defendant alleged in his answer, and as a principal defense,\u00a0 that the debt contracted by him had not yet matured ; that this\u00a0 was shown by the terms of the instrument itself, inasmuch as it appears therein stipulated\u00a0 that the payment of the debt shall be made in\u00a0 installments;\u00a0 and that,\u00a0 in conformity with this stipulation, on various dates, prior to\u00a0 the\u00a0 filing of the complaint, he\u00a0 had\u00a0 made several partial payments aggregating the sum of P315, and\u00a0 subsequently deposited\u00a0 and still\u00a0 continued to deposit with the clerk\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 court, at the plaintiffs' disposal, the sum of P30\u00a0 a month, which deposits\u00a0 he had so made since the month of March, 1908, in view of the fact that\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiffs had refused to receive such money as partial\u00a0 payments. During the trial\u00a0 it was\u00a0 agreed by the parties that the sum\u00a0 which the defendant owed the plaintiffs\u00a0 on\u00a0 March 28, 1906, the\u00a0 date\u00a0\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 aforementioned document, was P5,317.35.<br\/><br\/>In view of the evidence adduced\u00a0 at the\u00a0 trial,\u00a0 the\u00a0 court found that a monthly payment of P200 would be a reasonable compliance\u00a0 with the agreement to pay the debt\u00a0 in installments, and, in consequence of such finding, sentenced the defendant to pay to the plaintiffs the sum of P6,317.35 and ordered him\u00a0 to make payment thereof at the rate of P200 a month, on or before the 15th of each month, commencing with the 15th of April, 1909. Against this judgment the defendant appealed.<br\/><br\/>The defendant having\u00a0 bound\u00a0 himself to pay his debt to the plaintiffs in partial payments, as set forth in the note in question, it is seen that the obligation is one of payment by installments,\u00a0 since its fulfillment can not\u00a0 be required immediately nor does its existence depend upon the happening of any particular event. But, though the obligation is one of payment by installments, nevertheless\u00a0 no fixed day was specified\u00a0 for its fulfillment, so that the period\u00a0 for payment is undetermined or was not\u00a0 fixed by the parties when they executed the contract. Besides, it is evident that the term for payment was granted for the exclusive benefit of the defendant and\u00a0 for his own convenience, as by\u00a0 the language of the document, the plaintiffs gained nothing by the fact that the debt was\u00a0 not immediately demandable. Nor was\u00a0 any interest\u00a0 stipulated on the debt during\u00a0 the time that it should remain unpaid\u00a0 by\u00a0 the defendant.\u00a0 For the foregoing reasons, and in whatever manner this case be considered, it\u00a0 is unquestionable\u00a0 that it falls\u00a0 within the provisions\u00a0 of article 1128 of the Civil Code which\u00a0 is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Should\u00a0 the obligation\u00a0 not fix a period, but it can be inferred from its nature and circumstances that there was an intention to grant it to the debtor, the courts\u00a0 shall\u00a0 fix the duration of the same.<br\/><br\/>\"The courts shall also fix the duration of the period when it may have been left to the will\u00a0 of the debtor.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The obligation being manifestly defective\u00a0 with regard to the duration of the period\u00a0 granted to the debtor, that is, to the defendant, that defect must be\u00a0 cured by the courts through judicial decision\u00a0 which shall\u00a0 determine\u00a0 the said duration, under the power expressly granted them\u00a0 for such purpose by the legal provisions\u00a0 just above transcribed.<br\/><br\/>The trial court, therefore, acted in accordance with the law\u00a0 in exercising the said power in\u00a0 the\u00a0 present case,\u00a0 by fixing the duration of the period on the basis that the payment of the debt should be made at\u00a0 the rate of P200 a month; and we see no abuse of judicial discretion in fixing such\u00a0 a rate, considering the importance of the obligation and\u00a0 the absence of any stipulation of\u00a0 interest in favor of the creditors.<br\/><br\/>The appellant, grounding his argument on the fact of his having\u00a0 made three\u00a0 partial payments, in three different months, at the rate of P30 each, maintains that he can not be compelled\u00a0 to\u00a0 pay a\u00a0 greater amount\u00a0 monthly,\u00a0 for the reason,\u00a0 he says,\u00a0 that such\u00a0 payments,\u00a0 made\u00a0 and accepted without controversy between the parties, were a fulfillment and an explanation which, by their mutual accord, became agreed upon\u00a0 by them, of the words \"in partial payments\" contained in the document in question.\u00a0 This claim is in all\u00a0 respects untenable.\u00a0\u00a0 The appellant\u00a0 made several other payments of different sums (of P25, P50, and P100), and even hypothetically admitting his argument, there could be no reason for\u00a0 saying that the sum of P30 a\u00a0 month was agreed upon, and not the amounts just above-mentioned, or any\u00a0 of them, as the regular rate for the partial payments of the debt,\u00a0 since all the sums mentioned were received, without any protest whatever, by the plaintiffs.\u00a0 The very diversity of the amounts of the various payments made\u00a0 by the defendant clearly shows that there was\u00a0 no\u00a0 agreement, either express or implied, that such\u00a0 payments were to\u00a0 be effected at the rate\u00a0 of\u00a0 exactly P30\u00a0 a month.\u00a0\u00a0 The mere fact\u00a0 of the plaintiffs having\u00a0 accepted and received the said payments, is not and can not in\u00a0 any\u00a0 manner be considered as an expression or proof of such an agreement, especially because, as the plaintiffs' manager stated in\u00a0 his testimony, \"on seeing that Mr. Paterno insisted\u00a0 on paying only P30 a month, we refused to accept\u00a0 it.\"<br\/><br\/>The amount due by the\u00a0 defendant on March 28,\u00a0 1906, was that of P5,317.35, according to agreement of the parties during the trial.\u00a0 The evidence\u00a0 clearly shows that the defendant paid on account of the said debt the following sums: June 6,\u00a0 1906, P100; September 4, 1906, P50;\u00a0 January 8, 1907, P25; April\u00a0 1, 1907, P50; August 3, 1907, P30; September 3, 1907, P30; and October\u00a0 3, 1907, P30; which amounts aggregate the sum of P315.\u00a0 This sum should be deducted\u00a0 from\u00a0 the\u00a0 said\u00a0 debt and\u00a0 the balance,\u00a0 P5,002.35, remaining against the defendant,\u00a0 is\u00a0 the amount which he should be sentenced,\u00a0 as\u00a0 we hereby\u00a0 sentence him,\u00a0 to\u00a0 pay to the plaintiffs,\u00a0 and not\u00a0 that of\u00a0 P5,317.35, set forth in the judgment appealed from.<br\/><br\/>With this sole modification, we affirm the said judgment, without\u00a0 express finding\u00a0 as to\u00a0 the costs\u00a0 of this instance.

Charles A. Low presiding, and each sentenced to the maximum penalty of death.\u00a0 Jaime appealed,\u00a0 and the case as to Balagtas is before us <i>en consulta.<\/i><br\/><br\/>The two defendants lived in the same\u00a0 house on Calle Lemery, district of Tondo, city of Manila.\u00a0 About dark on the 4th\u00a0 day\u00a0 of\u00a0 May, 1910,\u00a0 the\u00a0 deceased,\u00a0 Simeon Flores, visited the house where the defendants were living and about thirty minutes after\u00a0 arriving\u00a0 the deceased\u00a0 and the\u00a0 two defendants left the house, going toward Gagalangin, passing along Calle Lemery where they saw Valentin Franco\u00a0 and Braulio Capulong conversing in\u00a0 front of Franco's house. Franco asked Balagtas where they were going and received the reply:\u00a0 \"We\u00a0 are just\u00a0 going there,\" without mentioning any particular place.\u00a0 When\u00a0 the\u00a0 deceased and the two defendants arrived at the\u00a0 place on\u00a0 Calle Gagalangin where the street car track crosses,\u00a0 the three turned and entered a narrow street (<i>callejon<\/i>) which leads to the railroad track. They\u00a0 continued some distance along this street, walking in single file, the deceased being in the center.\u00a0 When they were about ninety yards from any\u00a0 house and while in an obscure place\u00a0 on the railroad track, at about eight o'clock at night, the deceased was knocked down, and while down was struck two or three blows in the face and rendered practically unconscious.\u00a0 While in this unconscious condition, but\u00a0 still groaning, the two defendants, one taking him by the head and the other by the feet, carried him across the embankment, which was alongside the railroad track, and threw\u00a0 him into a small pond of water, face downward.\u00a0 The defendants then returned to their house.\u00a0 The\u00a0 deceased remained in that position until\u00a0 the following day when his body\u00a0 was found\u00a0 there by\u00a0 the policemen Hartpence\u00a0 and Solis who conducted the body to the morgue where it was later identified as that of Simeon Flores by Valentin Franco, a friend and neighbor of\u00a0 the deceased.<br\/><br\/>No one except the deceased and the two defendants were in that immediate vicinity when this crime was committed so as to how and under what circumstances the deed was executed we must look to\u00a0 the confessions and testimony of the defendants and the wounds upon the body of the deceased.<br\/><br\/>Pedro Balagtas was arrested on the morning of May 6, 1910, and Gregorio Jaime was arrested on that same afternoon.\u00a0\u00a0 Each of these defendants, in the presence of George R. Hartpence, Catalino Fernandez,\u00a0 and Eugenio Dizon,\u00a0 on the same day of\u00a0 their arrest, gave a detailed\u00a0 statement leading up to and the cause of the death of Simeon Fldres. In his confession,\u00a0 Pedro Balagtas stated\u00a0 that the deceased was knocked down by Gregorio Jaime, and while upon the 'ground Jaime struck him two or three times in the face; while,\u00a0 on the other hand, Jaime stated that these acts were performed by Balagtas.\u00a0 These two\u00a0 men were taken\u00a0 by Hartpence separately and each pointed out the exact place where\u00a0 the killing occurred.<br\/><br\/>Pedro Balagtas, testifying in his own behalf, said:<br\/><blockquote>\"I had come\u00a0 from work I was doing at 6 o'clock and Simeon Flores called Gregorio Jaime\u00a0 and myself.\u00a0 I went with them\u00a0 and\u00a0 while we were walking,\u00a0 Simeon\u00a0 Flores bought some vino and gave it to Gregorio.\u00a0\u00a0 Then we walked towards GagalanTHn and when we got in front of the switch we turned into\u00a0 an alley.\u00a0\u00a0 When we went into\u00a0 this alley Simeon Flores said he was going to see a friend of his\u00a0 on Calle Solis; that he\u00a0 was going to a <i>duplo<\/i> party; we kept on\u00a0 walking until\u00a0 we got to the railroad tracks.\u00a0\u00a0 I was walking ahead and suddenly I heard them quarreling behind me.\u00a0 I did not pay any attention to them at first because, in the first place, I am sick and I did not want to meddle\u00a0 in their affairs. When\u00a0 they were quarreling I suddenly heard Simeon Flores fall behind me and I looked back and saw Simeon Flores with his face down on the\u00a0 ground.\u00a0 I heard Simeon Flores ask Gregorio Jaime why\u00a0 Gregorio did not give him the things he promised to give him.<br\/><br\/>\"Gregorio pulled the body to where there was water and\u00a0 he asked\u00a0 me to help him\u00a0 and said if\u00a0 I\u00a0 didn't help him he would implicate me too.\u00a0\u00a0 As I could not fight with him I helped him with my arms.\u00a0 He took hold of both knees of the man and I took hold with my one arm and I pushed the body into the water.\u00a0 He (Flores)\u00a0 was still groaning.\u00a0 I never had a fight with him (Flores) and we never quarreled. He (Gregorio Jaime) killed\u00a0 Simeon Flores\u00a0 with a piece of wood something like a board was all I could see.\u00a0\u00a0 Gregorio and Flores had been drinking some <i>vino<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.

Did you make any confession to him\u00a0 (Hartpence) ? - A. I told him exactly what I have stated here.\u00a0 I\u00a0 told him that.\u00a0\u00a0 I pointed out the\u00a0 place to him where this crime was committed.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The other\u00a0 defendant,\u00a0 Gregorio Jaime, related what occurred in the following language:<br\/><blockquote>\"When I returned from work about 6 o'clock on the evening of May 4, Pedro Balagtas and Simeon\u00a0 Flores were at my house.\u00a0 He, Pedro,\u00a0 asked me to loan\u00a0 him ten cents. He said he was going to send for some vino so he could start his meal.\u00a0 I gave him the ten cents and he gave it to my wife and sent my wife to buy some <i>vino.<\/i>\u00a0\u00a0 When\u00a0 the vino arrived he took his supper and\u00a0 Simeon Flores drank some <i>vino.<\/i>\u00a0\u00a0 Then after he had his supper Pedro said, let us go to the <i>duplo,<\/i> and Simeon Flores\u00a0 said, 'That is right, let us take Gregorio with us.'\u00a0 I asked them where the duplo was and Pedro said, 'At my <i> compadre's <\/i>house, at Palampo.' Then we started and dressed up and\u00a0 went to Calle Lemery; we met on our way Valentin Franco and another man and Valentin Franco asked Pedro where he was going and Pedro said, 'We are just taking a\u00a0 walk,'\u00a0\u00a0 Then\u00a0 we walked on towards Gagalangin.\u00a0\u00a0 When we got down on the other side of the\u00a0 bridge there is a <i>Chino<\/i> store and the two\u00a0 of them went in and\u00a0 drank some <i>vino.<\/i>\u00a0 When we got into the alley I saw that Pedro had a club, and I asked Pedro where he had that club because I did not see it before, and he said he had it stuck inside his shirt.\u00a0 I asked him why we had come through Gagalangin because I understood we were going to Palampo; he said he was going for a friend; he was going to get a friend there. We walked\u00a0 on ahead through the fish ponds in the direction of the railroad tracks.\u00a0 When we came near the railroad\u00a0 track we went towards the place where there was a pond\u00a0 and from there went toward\u00a0 Calle Solis. When we were some distance from the railroad track, about from here to that house\u00a0 (indicating Justice Johnson's house, estimated at one hundred yards\u00a0 distance),\u00a0 I was ahead\u00a0 of them and they were together by the railroad track.\u00a0 I heard a noise and I turned my face and I saw Simeon Flores with his face down.\u00a0\u00a0 And I saw Pedro Balagtas strike him again on the neck with a piece of wood,\u00a0 a square piece of wood. When I saw him strike Simeon Flores again with the piece of wood I ran\u00a0 away and Pedro\u00a0 called me and said, 'Why are you running away ? If you don't come back I will report you as one of the authors of this.'\u00a0\u00a0 Sp in view of that I returned to that place where he was and I stood at a distance from him about that\u00a0 far (five\u00a0 feet).\u00a0 I stood there\u00a0 and I\u00a0 saw Pedro turn over the body\u00a0 of Simeon Flores and strike him again three\u00a0 times on the neck.\u00a0 He told me when we went back to the\u00a0 house\u00a0 that the reason he killed Simeon\u00a0 Flores was because he\u00a0 had ill\u00a0 feelings for him.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 Did you help put the body into the water? - A. He asked me to help him and I pushed the body, but I did not use my arms to help him.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Who took\u00a0 the clothes off the deceased? - A. When we were near the ditch he asked me to help him and I saw Pedro Balagtas take off his clothes.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. What did you do that\u00a0 for? - A. I don't know what he did it for because the train was coming and then I told him 'The train, the train is coming now, but he did not leave the place.\u00a0 When I saw the train coming I started to run away and he followed me, carrying with him the clothes.\" <\/blockquote>The body of the\u00a0 deceased was examined on May 5 by Dr. Oscar Teague who holds an M. D. diploma from the University of Berlin.\u00a0\u00a0 The doctor, who was called as a witness, on being asked to state the result of his examination, or autopsy, replied as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"It was the\u00a0 body of\u00a0 a large Filipino man.\u00a0\u00a0 There was indication that the man had been dead for some time.\u00a0 I found on the lower side of the face,\u00a0 just below the jaw, three wounds each about two centimeters and a half long, the edges of the wounds being smooth, with no contusions. There was considerable swelling\u00a0 of the right side of the face and on the right side of the neck extending almost from the right ear down to the lower part of the neck.\u00a0 On cutting through the skin of this region there was found to be a large amount\u00a0 of blood underneath the\u00a0 skin and\u00a0 outside of the blood vessels.\u00a0 On seizing the jaw about the middle it was found to be easily,moved from side to\u00a0 side and on passing my finger into the mouth I found that the jaw was completely fractured in two places.\u00a0 On the right side about two centimeters from the median line - from the middle and on the left not quite so far.\u00a0 On the back of the neck, just below the lower mark of the\u00a0 hair line there\u00a0 was a wound about six centimeters long.\u00a0\u00a0 This passed clean through the skin and the edges were smooth.\u00a0 There was no contusion in the neighborhood of this wound.<br\/><br\/>\"The internal organs with the exception\u00a0 of the Jungs were, so far as I could\u00a0 determine, uniform.\u00a0 The man had been dead for some time, but so far as I could determine the organs were all uniform.\u00a0 The lungs were full, very largely extended.\u00a0 On\u00a0 opening\u00a0 the\u00a0 chest they\u00a0 bulged\u00a0 forward whereas\u00a0 ordinarily the lungs are collapsed and on following up the bronchial tubes\u00a0 I found particles of food matter -\u00a0 vegetable food matter extending deep into the lungs, especially into the right\u00a0 one. Evidently\u00a0 the man\u00a0 had\u00a0 been vomiting and inhaled these particles into\u00a0 the\u00a0 lungs.\u00a0 The wound at the back of the neck was slight.\u00a0 The wounds under the jaw were not of a nature to indicate that they were the cause of the death. There was a\u00a0 considerable loss of blood but I would\u00a0 not consider that it\u00a0 was enough lost to cause death.\u00a0 But considering from the lungs the cause of death may have been\u00a0 from suffocation.\u00a0 The fact that the blood inside of the heart was not clotted would also indicate that suffocation may have taken place.\u00a0 But I am unable to state definitely the cause of death.\u00a0 It may have been from a contusion of the brain, this being evidently a severe blow which caused the\u00a0 fracture of the\u00a0 jaw.\u00a0 There was not hemorrhage in the brain,\u00a0 nor fracture at the\u00a0 base of the skull.\u00a0 The wounds were\u00a0 evidently made with a cutting object of some kind as they were about the same length; the three wounds under the jaw could have been made by the same instrument.\u00a0 The general\u00a0 direction of\u00a0 the wounds indicate that the instrument passed through the skin and went directly to the jaw.\u00a0 There was no indication that the jaw was dislocated at the swing, and the large blood vessels of the neck, so far as I could determine, were not injured. The wounds were the cause of\u00a0 his death - the direct cause possibly.\u00a0 The indications\u00a0 were such that death may have been due\u00a0 to\u00a0 suffocation.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 disturbed condition of the lungs and the blood in the heart were all evidences of suffocation.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>There is no material\u00a0 difference\u00a0 between the\u00a0 confessions made by\u00a0 the defendants\u00a0\u00a0 in the\u00a0 presence\u00a0 of\u00a0 Hartpence, Fernandez and Dizoh and their testimony given on the trial. The defendants themselves do not contradict each other in a number of material details.\u00a0 They practically agree\u00a0 as to the\u00a0 time that\u00a0 they, in\u00a0 company with the deceased, left the house,\u00a0 the route travelled, the house and place of the killing, and as to their return together.\u00a0 While they\u00a0 agree that at the time Flores was knocked down they were walking in single file, with the deceased in the middle, they do not agree as to which one was in\u00a0 front nor as to which one knocked the\u00a0 deceased down.\u00a0 Balagtas says that\u00a0 he was walking in front; that\u00a0 he heard\u00a0 them\u00a0 (the deceased and Jaime) quarreling behind him; that\u00a0 he\u00a0 heard\u00a0 Flores fall and that when he looked around he saw Flores with his face on the ground and Jaime\u00a0 striking him two\u00a0 or three\u00a0 times while he was down.\u00a0 Jaime testified that\u00a0 he was ahead and that Balagtas, who wtts behind, knocked Flores down.\u00a0 They both admit having assisted\u00a0 in throwing Flores' body into the water.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 record\u00a0 clearly establishes the\u00a0 guilt of each of the defendants as\u00a0 principals of having caused the violent death of Simeon Flores.\u00a0 The trial\u00a0 court qualified this crime as murder, saying:<br\/><blockquote>\"The element of treachery\u00a0 is clearly shown by the evidence,\u00a0 and also that of premeditation.\u00a0\u00a0 There are also two aggravating circumstances, to wit; that the crime was committed at night and in an uninhabited place.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>If there were\u00a0 present in the commission\u00a0 of this crime either\u00a0 one of the qualifying circumstances - <i>aleviosia<\/i> or known premeditation - the crime would be that of murder. There\u00a0 is not the slightest proof in the record to show that the defendants had, prior to the moment of the killing, resolved\u00a0 to commit this crime, nor is there any proof that the death of Flores was the result of meditation,\u00a0 calculation, or reflection.\u00a0 But on the contrary the record discloses that the defendants were,\u00a0 before leaving the house,\u00a0 engaged in a friendly conversation with the deceased, bought and drank some <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vino,<\/span> and agreed to go\u00a0 out for a walk and visit the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">duplo<\/span>-a debating society.\u00a0 On their way to this place they stopped and conversed with Valentin Franco, and also they, or at least two of them, stopped in a tienda and took another drink.\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of proof of overt acts showing that the defendants had meditated upon the commission of this crime\u00a0 prior to its execution, it was error to hold that the deed was committed with known premeditation,\u00a0\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Donoso, 3 Phil. Rep., 234.)<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 Attorney-General\u00a0 is of the opinion that there was present the qualifying circumstance of <i>alevosia<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>\"There\u00a0 is treachery (<i>alevosia<\/i>) when the culprit commits any crime against persons,\u00a0 employing means,\u00a0 methods, or forms\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 execution thereof which\u00a0 tend to directly and specially insure it without risk to the person of the criminal, arising from\u00a0 the defense the injured\u00a0 party might make. (No. 2, art. 10, Penal Code.)<br\/><br\/>It is not contended that the defendants did, prior to or at the commencement of the attack, use or employ any means or methods\u00a0 which can legally be regarded as treacherous. But it is insisted that the\u00a0 fact that the defendants\u00a0 threw the deceased into the water, face downward, while he was still alive and in a helpless and\u00a0 defenseless\u00a0 condition, constitutes treachery.\u00a0 With this proposition we can not\u00a0 agree. When the body was examined by the doctor, three wounds, each about\u00a0 two and one-half centimeters in length, were found on the lower part of the face.\u00a0 The jaw was fractured in two\u00a0 places.\u00a0\u00a0 There was also on the back of the neck, just below the hair line, another wound about six centimeters in\u00a0 length which passed through\u00a0 the\u00a0 skin.\u00a0 On cutting through the skin at three places near these wounds a large amount of blood outside of the vessels, was found.\u00a0 The internal organs, except the\u00a0 lungs, were\u00a0 uniform.\u00a0 The doctor was not certain whether the wounds, or the suffocation, or both, was the cause of the.death of the deceased. But assuming\u00a0 that\u00a0 the deceased\u00a0 would have\u00a0 recovered from the\u00a0 effects of the four wounds, if he had not been thrown\u00a0 into the water,\u00a0 yet we still think that the proofs fail to show that there was present treachery, as the knocking down of the deceased, striking him while on the ground, and throwing him into the water were all done in so short a time and one movement followed the other in such rapid succession, constitute one and the same attack.\u00a0\u00a0 In\u00a0 order that treachery\u00a0 may be considered as a\u00a0 qualifying circumstance\u00a0 to raise\u00a0 the\u00a0 classification of the crime,\u00a0 or\u00a0 as an aggravating circumstance to augment the penalty, it must be shown that the\u00a0 treacherous acts were present at and preceded the commencement of the attack which caused the injury\u00a0 complained\u00a0 of.\u00a0 After\u00a0 the\u00a0 commencement\u00a0 of such an attack and before its termination an accused person may have employed\u00a0 means or methods\u00a0 which were of a treacherous character, and yet such means or methods would not constitute the circumstance of alevosia.\u00a0 One continuous attack, such as the one which resulted in the death of the deceased Flores,\u00a0 can not be broken\u00a0 up into\u00a0 two or more parts and made to constitute separate, distinct, and independent attacks so that treachery may be injected therein and considered as\u00a0 a qualifying\"\u00a0 or aggravating\u00a0 circumstance.<br\/><br\/>Nocturnity is\u00a0 not necessarily\u00a0 an aggravating\u00a0 circum- stance, and the same should be\u00a0 taken\u00a0 into\u00a0 consideration according to. the circumstances surrounding the commission of the crime.\u00a0\u00a0 Where it is not evident that the defendants had purposely sought the nighttime to perpetrate the crime, nocturnity can not\u00a0 be\u00a0 considered as an aggravating circumstance.\u00a0 While it is true that the defendants in the case under consideration killed the deceased about eight o'clock at night, it is not shown that they purposely sought this hour for this purpose.<br\/><br\/>As to the aggravating circumstance of the\u00a0 crime having been\u00a0 committed in\u00a0 an\u00a0 uninhabited place, also taken into consideration\u00a0 by\u00a0 the court below,\u00a0 the record discloses that this crime was committed on the railroad tracks, within\u00a0 90 yards of\u00a0 inhabited\u00a0 houses.\u00a0 The\u00a0 houses were sufficiently near\u00a0 for the\u00a0 inmates to\u00a0 have heard calls for help if the deceased had cried out in a loud voice,<br\/><blockquote>\"An uninhabited place is one where there are no houses at all, a considerable distance from town, or where the houses are scattered at a great distance from each other.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs.<\/i>\u00a0 Salgado, 11 Phil.

That judgment be entered for\u00a0 the plaintiff, to whom the defendant shall pay the sum of P1,150, which is the true amount due and unpaid on the said mortgage, together with legal interest thereon from the date of the filing of the complaint ; and<br\/><br\/>\"2. That judgment be also entered for the administrator of the estate of the deceased Yong Alam, and against\u00a0 the defendant Hizola, for the sum of P3,910, with the interest due thereon, and this shall not prevent the plaintiff, Lee Liong, from realizing upon\u00a0 the said mortgage credit\u00a0 for the sum of P1,150, with its corresponding interest.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>From this judgment only the plaintiff Lee Liong appealed, jso in the present decision we have nothing to\u00a0 do\u00a0 with\u00a0 the part thereof whereby the defendant Hizola is sentenced to pay the sum of P3,910 to the administrator of the\u00a0 estate of Yong Alam.\u00a0 This part of the judgment being consented to by Hizola, it can not be reviewed in the present instance, as the only appeal pending is the\u00a0 one raised by the plaintiff Lee Liong.<br\/><br\/>The findings of fact of the judgment appealed from are, in general, in agreement with the evidence produced at trial. So the following facts,\u00a0 as proved, are true,\u00a0 to wit; that Hizola, in August,\u00a0 1904,\u00a0 purchased from the Chinaman Yong Alam a piece\u00a0 of\u00a0 hemp land for P5,400; that at\u00a0 the time of the latter's death,\u00a0 in September following, the said Hizola still owed him more than P3,000, the unpaid balance; that after Yong Alam's death, Hizola believing, by mistake \u00abor not, a fact in either event immaterial to the case, though undoubtedly in good faith, that one Yong Ajiong was the legitimate son and therefore the legal heir of Yong Alam, entered into negotiations with him,concerning the\u00a0 payment of that debt, and, as a\u00a0 result of the\u00a0 agreement, thereupon paid him, on account, the sum of Pl,000 which the within plaintiff,\u00a0 Lee\u00a0 Liong, furnished\u00a0 Hizola as a loan\u00a0 for the purpose; the latter executed in favor of the former a mortgage instrument\u00a0 as security\u00a0 for the\u00a0 said sum with its\u00a0 interest, that is, for the sum\u00a0 total of P1,150,\u00a0 and\u00a0 another mortgage instrument in favor of Yong Ajiong for the sum of P2,160, which\u00a0 he supposed was the yet unpaid remainder of the price of the land purchased by him, Hizola, from Yong Alam.\u00a0\u00a0 It is also true that both mortgages were canceled by Lee Liong on September 26,1905, the latter, in canceling that drawn in favor of Yong Ajiong, acting in the capacity of attorney in fact for the said Ajiong; and on\u00a0 the following day, the 27th of the month aforesaid, Hizola executed\u00a0 in favor of Lee Liong the instrument of mortgage for the value of P4,358.50, which serves\u00a0 as a foundation for the action brought in the present suit.\u00a0\u00a0 But it is not true that the only amount furnished by Lee Liong to Hizola on account of the P4,358.50 just mentioned was merely\u00a0 that of P1,000, and that for this reason the mortgage debt\u00a0 contracted by Hizola in the said instrument is founded on a false consideration in so far\u00a0 as it exceeds the said P1,000, and is therefore void on the supposition that he really and actually did not receive from Lee Liong the remaining P3,358.50. The contrary finding of the trial\u00a0 judge with respect to this particular is in no manner justified by the evidence^ which, in our opinion, sufficiently shows that Lee Liong did in fact pay to\u00a0 Hizola the whole sum of P4,358.50 mentioned in the instrument referred to.<br\/><br\/>The P1,150 recognized in the judgment appealed from\u00a0 as owing to Lee Liong, and with respect\u00a0 to which there is no question at issue, must\u00a0 of course\u00a0 be discounted.\u00a0 The evidence clearly shows that, besides\u00a0 that amount, Lee Liong paid to Hizola P2,760, to be turned\u00a0 over to the Chinaman Yong Ajiong. Lee Liong made the payment directly to the latter by\u00a0 direction and\u00a0 upon the request of\u00a0 Hizola.\u00a0 As already stated, Hizola, acting under the belief that\u00a0 Yong Ajiong was the son and legitimate heir of Yong Alam, agreed to pay to Ajiong what\u00a0 he,\u00a0 Hizola, was still owing on the price of the land sold to him by Yong Alam during his life-time, and forthwith delivered to\u00a0 him on -account the sum\u00a0 of P1,000\u00a0 and executed an instrument of mortgage in his favor for\u00a0 the remainder, P2,760.\u00a0 Subsequently,\u00a0 Yong Ajiong went to China, leaving\u00a0 Lee Liong in these Islands\u00a0 as his attorney in\u00a0 fact and to whom, on the\u00a0 lapse of the\u00a0 period designated in the said instrument, he gave instructions from China to collect from\u00a0 the herein\u00a0 defendant,\u00a0 Hizola, the credit recorded in that document.\u00a0\u00a0 A demand for payment having been made upon the latter by Lee Liong, by virtue of the said instructipns, he borrowed from Lee Liong the money necessary to pay the amount specified in the aforementioned instrument to Yong Ajiong\u00a0 and requested him at the same time to remit such money directly, in the borrower's name, to the said\u00a0 Ajiong, which the plaintiff Lee Liong in fact did.\u00a0 With\u00a0 regard to this\u00a0 point, both the plaintiff and the Chinaman\u00a0 Yong Ajiong gave positive testimony.\u00a0 The latter stated that, while in China, he received the sum of ?2,760 which \"was remitted to him by his attorney In\u00a0 fact, Lee Liong, as a payment by Hizola of the obligation contained in the instrument\u00a0 referred to.\u00a0 The testimony of them both appears to be corroborated by.the receipt for\u00a0 the said payment, on file among\u00a0 the records, transmitted from China by Yong Ajiong to\u00a0 Lee Liong, which reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"Received from Mr. Lee Liong the sum of \u00a512,760, the said sum having been paid\u00a0 by Ysidoro Hizola in settlement of his account.<br\/><br\/>\"I issue this receipt and deliver it to Lee Liong, as proof.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: right;\">\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Signed)\u00a0\u00a0 \"YONG AJIONG.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Real writing,<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"City of Ping Nam, 81st\u00a0 year of Cong Soy (Kwang Sui) 12th moon,\u00a0 11th\u00a0 day.\"<br\/><br\/>P1,150 on the one hand,\u00a0 and F2,760 on the other, make the sum of P3,910, and the difference between that amount and the total sum of P4,358.50, specified in the instrument which serves as a basis for the complaint, is, according to the plaintiff, the value of the effects taken from his store by Hizola.\u00a0\u00a0 This assertion of the\u00a0 plaintiff is confirmed by Hizola, himself who,\u00a0 on testifying with\u00a0 regard\u00a0 to the sum mentioned in the said instrument, stated that <i>\"there was also included here the value of the effects which 1 took from the Chinaman Lee Liong.\" <\/i><\/blockquote>Thus\u00a0 Hizola\u00a0 could, with entire truthfulness, make the statement which appears recorded in the instrument in question : that the plaintiff Lee Liong furnished him the sum of P4,358.50 claimed in the complaint, the payment of which was secured by mortgage in the said instrument.\u00a0\u00a0 This document, in so far as it contains the acknowledgment of the said debt made by Hizola in favor of Lee Liong, in conjunction with the other evidence already herein before mentioned, fully shows that the latter actually paid to the former, that is, to Hizola, all of the aforesaid sum.\u00a0 The proofs of this fact are so complete and so convincing that they can not be overcome in any manner by the mere unsupported denial of Hizola, which is the only defense employed by him to offset the force of the statements freely and voluntarily made by him in the instrument\u00a0 referred to.\u00a0 It is to be noted that Hizola did not deny the legality of this instrument nor the fact of its execution; he merely stated that he did not actually receive from Lee Liong the sum which he therein acknowledges to have received.<br\/><br\/>It is stated in the judgment that the credit claimed by the plaintiff is derived in part from the transfer made in his favor by Yong Ajiong of the credit of \u00a52,760 which he held against Hizola, and that this transfer was effected by means of the receipt aforementioned, accrediting the payment of the said sum made by Hizola to Yong Ajiong, through Lee Liong.\u00a0 We are convinced that the obligation contracted by Hizola to pay the said sum to Yong Ajiong lacked consideration, or was founded on\u00a0 a false consideration,\u00a0 due to\u00a0 the erroneous belief entertained by Hizola, on contracting that obligation, that Yong Ajiong was the legitimate\u00a0 heir of Yong Alam,\u00a0 to\u00a0 whom he owed\u00a0 that sum, while such\u00a0 was not the case.\u00a0\u00a0 And, consequently, if Lee Liong had acquired the credit from Yong\u00a0 Ajiong\u00a0 by transfer,\u00a0 a\u00a0 gratuitous transfer, as is apparently supposed in the judgment, Hizola could perhaps oppose against him the same exception to which\u00a0 he would be entitled against Yong Ajiong himself, founded on the falsity of the consideration of the obligation,. because, as the letter's transferee, he would be subrogated in his place for all purposes of law.\u00a0\u00a0 But, in our opinion, there was\u00a0 no such transfer.\u00a0 What took\u00a0 place\u00a0 was an actual, effective and true\u00a0 payment\u00a0 by\u00a0 Hizola to Yong Ajiong, through Lee Liong or by his mediation.\u00a0 In the receipt for the said payment, issued by Yong Ajiorig and herein before cited, it is useless to look for a single\u00a0 word, a single idea, or anything1 at all which may mean a transfer of Yong Ajiong's credit to Lee Liong.\u00a0\u00a0 This document is a real receipt, and nothing more than a receipt, of the payment made by Hizola to Yong Ajiong.\u00a0 For this reason, it was presented at the trial\u00a0 merely to\u00a0 prove the\u00a0 payment, and not to prove any transfer whatever of credit from Yong Ajiong to Lee Liong. The latter brought suit, not as the transferee of the former, but by exercising an\u00a0 individual right\u00a0 arising from the loan recorded in the instrument of September 27, 1905, executed in his favor by the defendant\u00a0 Hizola.<br\/><br\/>It having been proved that the\u00a0 plaintiff actually paid to Hizola the sum of P2,760 for\u00a0 payment to Yong Ajiong, the circumstance of the consideration which had induced Hizola to acknowledge\u00a0 himself\u00a0 a debtor of the latter for the said amount\u00a0 being found to\u00a0 be false,\u00a0 can not in any manner operate to\u00a0 the prejudice\u00a0 of the herein plaintiff, whose right to recover\u00a0 the sum mentioned is founded on the loan made by him to Hizola, and not on the obligation contracted by the latter, without consideration\u00a0 or for a false consideration, in favor of Yong Ajiong.\u00a0 The falsity of the consideration for this last obligation can\u00a0 only affect this obligation itself; it can not affect in any manner, either directly or indirectly, the other obligation contracted by Hizola\u00a0 in favor of the plaintiff; this was based on such a true and lawful consideration as is the positive, real and actual delivery by the plaintiff of the money\u00a0 furnished to\u00a0 Hizola\u00a0 as a loan. Whether the payment made by the latter to\u00a0 Yong Ajiong with this money was improper or not, Ajiong not really being a creditor of Hizola, is a question which should be determined between the two and could, at the most,\u00a0 be a legal ground upon which to demand\u00a0 from\u00a0 Yong Ajiong the restitution of the amount unduly paid.\u00a0 But this does not, nor can it release Hizola from the obligation to pay to the plaintiff the sum which he borrowed from the latter\u00a0 for the\u00a0 purpose of making the said payment to Yong Ajiong.\u00a0\u00a0 Whatever may be the legal nature of the juridical relation which existed between Ajiong and Hizola, it had nothing to\u00a0 do with that established between Hizola himself and the plaintiff, by virtue of the said loan.\u00a0 This latter relation\u00a0 is entirely distinct and separate from the former and can not,\u00a0 therefore, be affected by the vices, whatever they may be, to which that first relation may be subject.<br\/><br\/>We reverse the judgment appealed from, in so far as it sentences the defendant Ysidoro Hizola to pay to the plaintiff, Lee Liong, the sum of P1,150 only, and we sentence the said Hizola to pay to the latter the sum of P4,358.50, together with the legal interest due thereon, at the rate of six per cent per annum from the date of the filing of the complaint until actual. an<i be=\"\" been=\"\" by=\"\" civil=\"\" code=\"\" collection=\"\" complete=\"\" costs=\"\" credits.=\"\" effected=\"\" finding=\"\" for=\"\" have=\"\" in=\"\" instance.=\"\" is=\"\" made=\"\" manner=\"\" mortgage=\"\" must=\"\" no=\"\" of=\"\" payment=\"\" prescribed=\"\" procedure=\"\" section=\"\" shall=\"\" special=\"\" the=\"\" this=\"\" which=\"\"><br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

second, on\u00a0 the\u00a0 part of the\u00a0 opponent, the account\u00a0 current between Cornelia Laochangco and Macario Berenguer (Exhibit 5); and, third, the oral testimony produced concerning this documentary evidence.<br\/><br\/>The public instrument, Exhibit C, in part reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Don Macario Berenguer declares and states\u00a0 that he is the proprietor in fee-simple of two parcels of fallow unappropriated crown land situated\u00a0 within\u00a0 the district of his pueblo.\u00a0 The first has an area of 73 <i>quinones<\/i>, 8 <i>balitas<\/i>, and 8\u00a0 <i>loanes<\/i>, located in the sitio of Batasan, and its boundaries are, etc., etc.\u00a0 The\u00a0 second is in the sitio of Panantaglay, barrio of Calumpang, has an area of 73 hectares, 22 ares, and 6 centares, and is bounded on the north, etc., etc.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In the executory part of the said instrument, it is stated:<br\/><blockquote>\"That under condition\u00a0 of right to repurchase (pacto de retro) he sells the\u00a0 said properties\u00a0 to the\u00a0 aforementioned Dona Cornelia Laochangco for P4,000 and upon the following conditions: First, the sale\u00a0 stipulated shall be for\u00a0 the period of two years, counting from this date,\u00a0 within which time the deponent shall be entitled\u00a0 to repurchase the land sold upon payment of its price; second, the lands sold shall, during the term of the present contract,\u00a0 be\u00a0 held in lease by the undersigned who shall pay, as rental therefor, the sum of 400 pesos per annum, or the equivalent\u00a0 in sugar at the option of the vendor;

515 pesos'\u00a0 worth, in 1894; 806.37 pesos' worth, in 1896, and\u00a0 the interest thereon charged to him by his creditor at the rate of 12 per cent per annum.<\/li><\/ol>The opponent maintained, and his theory was accepted by the trial court, that Berenguer's contract with Laochangco was not one\u00a0 of sale\u00a0 with right of repurchase, but merely one of loan secured by those properties,\u00a0 and, consequently, that the ownership of the lands in question could not have been\u00a0 conveyed to Laochangco,\u00a0 inasmuch\u00a0 as\u00a0 it continued to be held by Berenguer, as well as their possession, which he had not ceased to enjoy.<br\/><br\/>Such a theory is, as argued by the appellants, erroneous. The\u00a0 instrument executed\u00a0 by Macario Berenguer, the text of which has been transcribed in this decision, is very clear. Berenguer's heirs may not go counter to the literal tenor of the obligation,\u00a0 the exact expression of the consent\u00a0 of the contracting parties contained in the instrument, Exhibit C. Not because the lands may have continued\u00a0 in possession of the vendor,\u00a0 not because the latter may have assumed the payment of\u00a0 the taxes on such properties, nor\u00a0 yet because the same party may have\u00a0 bound himself to substitute\u00a0 by another any one of the properties which might be destroyed, does the contract\u00a0 cease to be what it is,\u00a0 as set forth in detail in the public instrument.\u00a0 The vendor continued in the\u00a0 possession of the lands,\u00a0 not as\u00a0 the\u00a0 owner thereof as before their sale, but\u00a0 as the lessee which he became after its consummation,\u00a0 by\u00a0 virtue of a contract\u00a0 executed\u00a0 in his favor by the vendee in the deed itself, Exhibit C.\u00a0 Right of ownership is not implied by the circumstance of the lessee's assuming the responsibility of the payment\u00a0 of the taxes\u00a0 on the\u00a0 property leased, for their\u00a0 payment\u00a0 is\u00a0 not peculiarly incumbent upon the owner, nor is such right implied by the obligation to substitute the thing sold for another while\u00a0 in his possession under lease, since that obligation\u00a0 came from him and he continues under another character in its possession - a reason why he guarantees its integrity and obligates himself to return the thing even in a case\u00a0 of force majeure. Such liability, as a general rule, is foreign\u00a0 to contracts\u00a0 of lease and, if required, is exorbitant, but possible and lawful, if voluntarily agreed to, and such agreement does not on this account involve any sign of ownership, nor other meaning than the will to impose upon oneself scrupulous diligence in the care of a thing belonging to another.<br\/><br\/>The purchase and sale, once consummated, is a contract which by\u00a0 its nature transfers tjie ownership and\u00a0 other rights in the thing sold.\u00a0 A <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">pacto de retracto<\/span>, or sale with right to repurchase, is nothing but a personal right stipulated between the vendee and the vendor, to the end that the latter\u00a0 may again acquire the ownership of the\u00a0 thing alienated.<br\/><blockquote>\"It is true, very true indeed, that the sale with right of repurchase is employed as a method of loan; it is likewise true that in practice many cases occur where the consummation of a <i>pacto de retro<\/i> sale means the financial ruin of a person; it is also, unquestionable that in <i>pacto\u00a0 de\u00a0 retro<\/i> sales very\u00a0 important interests often intervene, in the\u00a0 form of the price of the lease of the thing sold, which is stipulated as an additional covenant.\"\u00a0 (Manresa, Civil Code, p.\u00a0 274.)<br\/><\/blockquote>But in\u00a0 the present case,\u00a0 unlike\u00a0 others heard by this court,\u00a0 there is no proof that\u00a0 the sale with right of\u00a0 repurchase, made by Berenguer in favor of\u00a0 Laochangco is rather a mortgage to secure a loan.<br\/><br\/>The account current between Berenguer and\u00a0 Laochangco appears to be nothing but the beginning of some\u00a0 business transactions in sugar, which gave rise to the contract of purchase and sale under <i>pacto de retracto,<\/i> and the continuation of the same transactions which maintained that contract beyond the period fixed for the redemption.\u00a0\u00a0 When, on\u00a0 October 5 1889, Berenguer's debt amounted to\u00a0 3,720.23 pesos, Cornelia Laochangco gave him 1,000 pesos more; so that she increased his debt to 4,720.23 pesos.\u00a0 The trial record offers no explanation of this conduct on the part of his\u00a0 creditor other than that derived from the fact that two\u00a0 days afterwards, on the 7th of the same month of October,\u00a0 1889, Berenguer\u00a0 executed the instrument of sale under <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">pacto de retracto<\/span>, of two parcels of land, one of 204 hectares and the other of 120, for the price of 4,000 pesos \"which Berenguer acknowledges that he has received from the vendee, already paid and in the legal tender currency of this country.\"<br\/><br\/>Among other fundamental reasons, the one just above mentioned is enough to establish the close relation\u00a0 between the account current and the contract of purchase and sale, under <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">pacto de retracto<\/span>, of the two parcels of land which are the subject of this case; and this explains how it came to be covenanted in the said instrument of October 7, 1889, that \"<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">all<\/span> the fruits of the\u00a0 said lands shall be deposited in the sugar depository of the vendee, situated in the district of Quiapo of this city, and <i><i>the value of which\u00a0 shall be applied on account of the price of this sale.\"<br\/><\/i><\/i><br\/>The term of two years, stipulated in the instrument for the exercise of the\u00a0 right of redemption,\u00a0 depended on such covenant, by the express will of the vendee, and, likewise by her\u00a0 express will, the\u00a0 term fixed for the redemption\u00a0 was extended until at least the\u00a0 year 1896, during which time it appears that Berenguer continued to deposit \"the\u00a0 fruits of the said\u00a0 lands\u00a0 in the sugar depository of the vendee,\" as payments on account of the price of the sale.<br\/><br\/>Until 1896, at\u00a0 least, there is no reason why the sale of the two\u00a0 parcels of land may be considered to\u00a0 have been consummated; until then the vendee, on\u00a0 account of and as the price of the repurchase, had continued to receive quantities\u00a0 of sugar, whereby it appears that the said\u00a0 vendee admitted, as late as 1896, the exercise of the right of\u00a0 repurchase\u00a0 on the part of the vendor who had been paying the price\u00a0 in sugar.<br\/><br\/>And up to the\u00a0 present time the right\u00a0 to the exercise of the privilege of redemption still subsists, more than one-half of the repurchase price having already been paid\u00a0 (excepting what is owing as\u00a0 rentals on the lease); and in this state of affairs it is utterly\u00a0 impossible to\u00a0 consider the\u00a0 right of repurchase\u00a0 as\u00a0 lapsed\u00a0 by considering the sale of the\u00a0 two said parcels of land as consummated,\u00a0 at any intermediate time or until a settlement shall have\u00a0 been\u00a0 made\u00a0 with\u00a0 respect to the value of the sugar turned in, in relation to the amount or price of the sale, and until the\u00a0 status of\u00a0 the right of redemption, as already exercised by means of partial payments of the price of the sale, shall have been determined.<br\/><br\/>Conventional redemption is the right\u00a0 which\u00a0 the vendor reserves to himself to recover the thing sold, with the obligation to reimburse to the vendee the price of the sale, the expenses of the contract, and any other legitimate payment made by reason of the sale, and the useful and necessary expenses incurred\u00a0 for\u00a0 account\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 thing\u00a0 sold.\u00a0 (Civil Code, articles 1507 and 1518.)<br\/><br\/>The right of redemption, in the present case, began to be exercised from the year following that of the sale and continued,\u00a0 during seven years, until 1896,\u00a0 in\u00a0 such\u00a0 wise\u00a0 that already in August,\u00a0 1890, the price\u00a0 which the vendor must reimburse to the vendee had been reduced to 3,888.61 pesos, and the\u00a0 reduction was continued by the deposits\u00a0 of sugar intended to cancel the debt.\u00a0\u00a0 This was done by the express will of\u00a0 both parties, who\u00a0 believed\u00a0 that by so doing, they best served their interests, and in\u00a0 that manner they\u00a0 covenanted\u00a0 and acted one towards the\u00a0 other, without the least contradiction\u00a0 or complaint.\u00a0 The exercise of the right of redemption having been commenced and such advancement having already been made\u00a0 up to 1896 in the way of reimbursement of the price of the repurchase,\u00a0 by the amount of sugar which the\u00a0 vendee had received from the vendor for the purpose of reimbursing the price of the sale, it is in no manner permissible, at the will of the heirs of the vendee, to consider an ownership irrevocable, the revocation of which had begun and continued by mutual agreement of both contracting parties.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 term\u00a0 of two years stipulated for\u00a0 the\u00a0 redemption expired; but in the\u00a0 contract itself\u00a0 there is the additional covenant that the vendor shall deposit\u00a0 under\u00a0 the control of the vendee all the fruits of the lands leased for the purpose of repaying the price of the sale.\u00a0\u00a0 After the expiration of that term of two years,\u00a0 the vendee continued receiving\u00a0 in subsequent years\u00a0 fruits of\u00a0 the leased\u00a0 lands, under that additional agreement that they all should be placed in his control in order to cancel the price of the sale. These are facts absolutely incompatible with the term stipulated and with the idea of the vendee becoming the owner of the lands merely by the expiration of the two years.<br\/><br\/>The vendee, who has been reimbursed by the vendor for a part of the repurchase price, is bound to fulfil the obligation to sell back, derived from\u00a0 the sale with right to repurchase, or must show reason why he\u00a0 may keep this part of the price and, notwithstanding his so doing,\u00a0 be considered released\u00a0 from effecting\u00a0 the\u00a0 resale.\u00a0 He may be entitled to require the completion\u00a0 of the price, or that he be paid other expenses before he returns the thing which he had purchased under such a condition subsequent; but the exercise of the right of redemption having been begun and admitted, the irrevocability of the ownership in\u00a0 such manner acquired is in all respects incompatible with these acts so performed.<br\/><br\/>For this reason, this court does not consider it necessary to come to any conclusion relative to the testimony\u00a0 of the opponent, Jose Berenguer, in so far as he testified that the agreement with right to repurchase was already canceled by the conveyance, in payment\u00a0 (which his father, during the latter's lifetime, had\u00a0 made to one of the heirs of the vendee) of the 120 hectare tract of land in Panantaglay, nor relative to the fact,\u00a0 an act at present consummated, of the applicants already\u00a0 being the owners, both of a part of the repurchase price and of one of the parcels of land which was the subject matter of the redemption.<br\/><br\/>It is sufficient for the purposes of the appeal\u00a0 to find, as we\u00a0 Hereby do find, that the right of redemption has not lapsed - a lapse\u00a0 which was the ground\u00a0 for the application for registration that was\u00a0 based on the consolidation\u00a0 of the ownership of the two parcels\u00a0 of land, in the vendee, from whom the applicants derive\u00a0 their right.\u00a0\u00a0 Nor\u00a0 had that right lapsed,\u00a0 with\u00a0 respect\u00a0 to the Panantaglay land;\u00a0 but as this land was, with the assent of the opponent, adjudicated in the\u00a0 judgment appealed from,\u00a0 the adjudication by such assent is effective.<br\/><br\/>But, with respect to the Batasan land, of more than 204 hectares\u00a0 in area, the trial court did not commit the third of the errors alleged in the appeal, by denying its registration in the new registry in the name of the applicants, as such denial is in accord with the law and the merits of the case, not by virtue of\u00a0 the findings contained in the judgment,\u00a0 but of those of\u00a0 the present decision, by reason of which latter the registration applied for is not permissible.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, only in so far as it finds\u00a0 that \"the adverse claim presented, relative to the parcel\u00a0 of land situated in Batasan, is\u00a0 allowed; consequently, the registration\u00a0 applied for by the applicants, in connection with the same land, is denied.\"<br\/><br\/>That part of\u00a0 the judgment appealed from whereby the cancellation is ordered \"of the registration\u00a0 entries found in the name of Cornelia Laochangco in the old registry of deeds\u00a0 of\u00a0 Pampanga\u00a0 Province, on pages 192 and 196 of volume 1\u00a0 of the\u00a0 district of Arayat, properties, Nos. 23 and 24 respectively,\u00a0 second inscription,\" is reversed in\u00a0 so .far as such entries concern the purchase and sale, with right of redemption, of the\u00a0 property\u00a0 No. 24, which is that of Batasan, - an inscription related\u00a0 to the more extensive one concerning the property No. 23, or that of Panantaglay.<br\/><br\/>No special finding is made as to the costs of this instance.

But in this\u00a0 case\u00a0 we are\u00a0 satisfied that it was\u00a0 impossible for the trial\u00a0 judge to ascertain, beyond a reasonable\u00a0 doubt, the truth of\u00a0 the findings on which he based his conclusion as to the guilt of the accused.<br\/><br\/>The incidents out\u00a0 of\u00a0 which this\u00a0 prosecution\u00a0 arose\u00a0 took place,\u00a0 in\u00a0 1899, nearly\u00a0 ten\u00a0 years before\u00a0 the complaining witness filed\u00a0 his complaint.\u00a0\u00a0 No satisfactory reason appears for the long delay on the\u00a0 part of the complaining witness in\u00a0 seeking redress for\u00a0 the alleged\u00a0 injury charged in his complaint.\u00a0 With\u00a0 manifest insincerity\u00a0 he pretends that he only discovered the facts in this regard a short time before the institution of\u00a0 the action; although if the facts alleged by him were true, it would seem\u00a0 that either he\u00a0 must have discovered them soon after they\u00a0 took place,\u00a0 or\u00a0 not at all. His witnesses and his alleged informants were neighbors and dependents among whom he had lived for the greater part of the ten years during which he says he was kept in ignorance\u00a0 of the occurrences of which\u00a0 he\u00a0 now\u00a0 complains.\u00a0 These occurrences, if he tells the truth,\u00a0 must have been generally known in\u00a0 the community where he\u00a0 lived, and not only did\u00a0 he have an active interest in discovering the facts, but some at least of his informants and witnesses had every reason to tell\u00a0 him all\u00a0 they\u00a0 knew\u00a0 as\u00a0 to what had occurred, and it is\u00a0 not suggested that any\u00a0 of them had any reason for concealing\u00a0 the\u00a0 facts\u00a0 or had any desire to do so.\u00a0 Under all the circumstances we are\u00a0 satisfied\u00a0 that if his\u00a0 allegations\u00a0 had\u00a0 any\u00a0 foundation in truth, he must have been\u00a0 fully informed of\u00a0 the facts\u00a0 many\u00a0 years before he filed\u00a0 his\u00a0 complaint.\u00a0 This\u00a0 unexplained delay\u00a0 in instituting the\u00a0 prosecution would under\u00a0 ordinary\u00a0 circumstances\u00a0 be sufficient to cast a\u00a0 doubt on the truth and sincerity of his claim for redress,\u00a0 and\u00a0 raises\u00a0 a\u00a0 question\u00a0 as to his motive in proceeding against the defendant at this time.\u00a0 Under the exceptional conditions existing at the time when it is alleged the estafa complained of was committed, it\u00a0 would,\u00a0 in\u00a0 any event, have\u00a0 been extremely difficult\u00a0 to ascertain and judicially determine,\u00a0 beyond a\u00a0 reasonable doubt, the truth of disputed facts\u00a0 of the nature of\u00a0 those upon which the\u00a0 complaint\u00a0 in this action\u00a0 is\u00a0 based.\u00a0 After the lapse of ten years\u00a0 these difficulties are multiplied\u00a0 to such a degree that\u00a0 in the absence of\u00a0 evidence of the\u00a0 most unimpeachable character, a conviction can not\u00a0 and should not be sustained.<br\/><br\/>The trial judge was compelled to reject the greater part of the evidence\u00a0 introduced\u00a0 by the prosecution as unconvincing\u00a0 and unsatisfactory\u00a0 and\u00a0 rested\u00a0 his judgment of conviction upon the testimony of\u00a0 one\u00a0 of the witnesses that he purchased a\u00a0 few cavans of rice\u00a0 from the defendant at about the time when it is alleged the larger amount of rice in question was in his charge.\u00a0 But aside from the inherent weakness of this evidence, it is to be observed that there is nothing whatever in the\u00a0 record which justifies the conclusion that the rice thus sold by the\u00a0 defendant, if in fact it was sold as alleged, was a part of the rice which plaintiff alleges he intrusted to defendant's care.<br\/><br\/>The judgment convicting the\u00a0 defendant\u00a0 and\u00a0 imposing sentence upon him\u00a0 should be reversed and\u00a0 the defendant acquitted\u00a0 of the crime charged in the\u00a0 information, with the costs\u00a0 of both instances <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">de oficio.<\/span>\u00a0 If\u00a0 in\u00a0 detention, he will be set at liberty forthwith, and\u00a0 if\u00a0 at large, his bond will be canceled and his bondsmen exonerated.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

In all cases of sickness or death of large cattle, horses, cattle, and carabaos,\u00a0 the owner of the sick or\u00a0 dead animal shall immediately report to the barrio lieutenant the place where the sick or\u00a0 dead animal is.\u00a0 The barrio lieutenant, without loss of time and within twenty-four our hours after the discovery of the case, shall report the .same to the municipal president,\u00a0 who,\u00a0 together\u00a0 with the president of the board of health, shall make a careful investigation, and if, thereby, it is found that the animal is attacked with rinderpest or by any of the diseases before mentioned, he shall\u00a0 immediately provide: (<i>a<\/i>) For the separation and quarantine of the infected animal; (<i>b<\/i>) For the cremation or burial of the remains of the animal, if it died of any of the diseases included in the previous description;\u00a0 (<i>c<\/i>) That a report be made to the provincial governor of the\u00a0 result of the investigation held by them.<br\/><br\/>\"2, It shall be the duty of the municipal secretary of each municipality to keep a complete record of all cases\u00a0 of sickness among large domestic animals\u00a0 and of the number of deaths which result from the same.\u00a0\u00a0 Such record shall show the brands and marks of the animal and the name\u00a0 and residence of its owner, and a transcript thereof shall be sent to the provincial governor at the end\u00a0 of every month. It shall furthermore be the duty of the municipal secretary to furnish a copy of the said record to any official veterinary, should he request it<br\/><br\/>\"3. Within thirty days after the receipt\u00a0 of these regulations\u00a0 the municipal council shall cause,\u00a0 an\u00a0 exact\u00a0 and complete list to be made of all the persons who have large domestic animals within the jurisdiction of the municipality, and furnish\u00a0 it to the municipal\u00a0 secretary.\u00a0\u00a0 This list must contain the names and addresses\u00a0 of the owners, the number of\u00a0 animals owned by each, and the\u00a0 barrio within\u00a0 which stich animals are kept.<br\/><br\/>\"4. All births, sales\u00a0 transfers, and deaths of\u00a0 large domestic animals within\u00a0 the municipality\u00a0 shall\u00a0 immediately be\u00a0 inscribed\u00a0 in this list by the municipal secretary.<br\/><br\/>\"5. The municipal secretary shall furnish a certified copy of\u00a0 this list to any employee of the Bureau of\u00a0 Agriculture within three days after his request for the same has been made.<br\/><br\/>\"6. On any date and at any hour fixed by the municipal president, in\u00a0 accordance with instructions received from the provincial governor or from any official veterinary, the said municipal president\u00a0 may\u00a0 require\u00a0 the owners\u00a0 to send all their domestic animals, or any of such animals as he may designate, to any place within the municipality, determined by\u00a0 the president and approved by the veterinary, for their inspection and inoculation.<br\/><br\/>\"7. If, from the\u00a0 examination of the animals, the veterinary should declare any of them\u00a0 to be affected with a dangerous and\u00a0 contagious\u00a0 disease,\u00a0\u00a0 the\u00a0 president shall\u00a0 immediately call an extra session of the council,\u00a0 and it shall then be the duty of the said council\u00a0 to establish a public corral for the detention of the\u00a0 sick, animals,\u00a0 to appoint corral guards or\u00a0 attendants, to compel the\u00a0 tying\u00a0 up of all the domestic\u00a0 animals of the same species that are attacked with\u00a0 disease, so as to avoid the unnecessary\u00a0 exposure to the infection of those that are well,\u00a0 to\u00a0 adopt quarantine regulations, and to appropriate from\u00a0 the municipal\u00a0 funds a sufficient sum for the payment of a corps of temporary employees for the enforcement of these regulations, of the costs of the prosecutions had before the justice of the peace court, and of other\u00a0 necessary expenses.<br\/><br\/>\"8. It shall also be the duty of the\u00a0 municipal council to . order the\u00a0 quarantine for a few days of all large cattle that may be imported from other provinces or islands, whenever it is reported that they have some infectious disease.<br\/><br\/>\"9.\u00a0 The public corral should be constructed at a place approved by the veterinary and surrounded by a double fence, with a space of at least 15 meters between the two fences.<br\/><br\/>\"10. When the number of deaths of any kind of domestic animal is abnormally\u00a0 great in any municipality or\u00a0 part of the\u00a0 same and the municipal authorities doubt their ability to prevent an increase thereof, the municipal president shall likewise notify the provincial governor of the existing conditions.<br\/><br\/>\"11. In all cases of\u00a0 deaths of carabaos, cattle and horses, and other domestic animals, from a contagious disease, their remains shall be cremated before burial; and Act No.\u00a0 262, passed on October 11,\u00a0 1901, shall be strictly complied with.<br\/><br\/>\"12. When a veterinary of the Bureau of Agriculture declares that an animal is infected with a contagious\u00a0 disease, such as surra, etc., and is\u00a0 incurable, he shall notify the municipal president thereof in writing, and it shall be the duty of the latter immediately to order the infected animal killed\u00a0 and its remains shall\u00a0 be\u00a0 disposed of in the manner provided by the preceding paragraph, No. 11, of this resolution : <i>Provided<\/i>, That, with the authorization of the municipal president, the veterinary may kill such animal.<br\/><br\/>\"13.

Jurisdiction is\u00a0 hereby conferred upon the justices of the peace of this province\u00a0 to\u00a0 try all infractors of these\u00a0 regulations.<br\/><br\/>\"14. It is further resolved that eight official copies of this resolution shall be\u00a0 furnished to each municipal secretary of this province, of which one copy shall be for the municipal president, one for the\u00a0 president of the municipal board of health, one for the justice of the peace, and the other five copies\u00a0 shall be posted in the most public places of the\u00a0 pueblo.

Because it makes no provision for compensation to the owners of such animals, and to that extent, as he alleges, is in conflict with the provisions of sections 5 and 74 of the Philippine Bill of Rights,\u00a0 which provide: \"That no law shall be enacted in said Islands which shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law, or deny to any person therein the equal protection of the laws;\" and, that in the exercise of the right of eminent domain, no private property shall be taken \"without just compensation paid or tendered therefor;\" and,<br\/><br\/>Second. Because, as counsel insists, the authority to provide by ordinance for the\u00a0 destruction of such animals is not included in the powers contained in the above-cited section 13 (<i>k<\/i>) of Act No. 83, amended\u00a0 by Act No. 133, upon which\u00a0 the provincial board\u00a0 expressly relied in enacting the ordinance. <br\/><br\/>A reference to our decision in the case of U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Toribio (15 Phil. Rep., 85), and the authorities cited therein, would seem to be sufficient to dispose of the first of these contentions.\u00a0 In that case, on both reason and authority, we held that in this jurisdiction the provisions of the Act of Congress of July 1,1902, were not intended to have the effect, and did not have the effect\u00a0 of denying to the Government of the Philippine Islands the right to exercise the\u00a0 sovereign police power\u00a0 in the promotion of the \"general welfare\" and the \"public interest.\"\u00a0 The quarantine, isolation,\u00a0 and even the slaughter of cattle suffering from infectious or contagious diseases are universally recognized as typical examples of the proper exercise of this power, in any case where the controlling public necessity for the checking of the ravages of such disease demands such interference with or destruction of the property of individuals,\u00a0 and\u00a0 provided\u00a0 the\u00a0 means adopted are reasonably necessary for the\u00a0 accomplishment of the purpose\u00a0 which it is sought to attain.\u00a0\u00a0 In the case of U.\u00a0 S.<i> vs.<\/i> Toribio (<i>supra<\/i>), we discussed at length the controlling\u00a0 public necessity which demands\u00a0 the\u00a0 adaption of the most stringent measures for the preservation of large cattle in these islands and the checking, as far as may be, of the ravages of\u00a0 the bighly\u00a0 contagious and\u00a0 infectious diseases to\u00a0 which they are exposed.\u00a0 We\u00a0 do not deem It necessary to repeat the discussion here, nor do we think it necessary\u00a0 to discuss at length\u00a0 the reasonableness\u00a0 of the ordinance under which\u00a0 the animal was shot in the case at bar.\u00a0 The mere reading of\u00a0 the ordinance is sufficient to satisfy the mind\u00a0 of\u00a0 any reasonable man, that so far as it provides for the slaughter of animals suffering from contagious or infectious diseases, it is eminently fair and just, if it be admitted that the slaughter of such animals in the exercise of the sovereign police power of the state can be justified\u00a0 under any circumstances.\u00a0\u00a0 It carefully guards the owner from the reckless or\u00a0 ill-considered action of the official charged with the duty of stamping out the\u00a0 diseases against which it is directed, and apparently it goes to the utmost limits, consistent with efficiency, in protecting the property rights of the individual and restraining the rigor of an\u00a0 admittedly and inherently harsh measure\u00a0 adopted under the stern pressure of necessity, \"the great master of all things.\"<br\/><br\/>In answer to the second contention, we think it is sufficient to say that\u00a0 the grant to the provincial boards of power to adopt by resolution, \"regulations for the suppression of any agricultural pest like locusts or cattle diseases,\" which is contained in the above-cited section 13 (<i>k<\/i>)\u00a0 of Act No. 83, as amended by Act No. 133 of the Philippine Commission, clearly and\u00a0 unquestionably confers upon these boards the same power to adopt\u00a0 such regulations\u00a0 as may be <i>necessary<\/i> for the suppression of diseases\u00a0 of\u00a0 cattle as\u00a0 was vested in the Commission itself.\u00a0 There\u00a0 are no limitations on the grant of power and none, therefore,\u00a0 can or should be implied upon the power vested\u00a0 in these boards other than those which\u00a0 the Commission itself was\u00a0 bound to respect.\u00a0 The perfect right of the Legislature in the exercise of the sovereign police\u00a0 power and in\u00a0 the\u00a0 promotion of the \"general welfare\" and the \"public interest\" to make reasonable laws or regulations for the slaughter of diseased animals, when this\u00a0 is necessary for the effective suppression of disease among cattle,\u00a0 can not\u00a0 be questioned upon acknowledged and general principles, and there can be no doubt therefore of the perfect\u00a0 right of the\u00a0 provincial\u00a0 boards in these Islands to make such regulations under the authority conferred upon them.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below must be reversed, and the complaint filed in this action dismissed, without special condemnation of costs in either instance.\u00a0 It is so ordered.<br\/><br\/><i> Arellano, C.

Herbert D. Gale presiding, convicting the accused of the crime defined and punished in section 1 of Act No. 619, and sentencing each one of them to ten years\u00a0 in prison and a fine of P20,000, to subsidiary imprisonment\u00a0 in\u00a0 case\u00a0 of\u00a0 insolvency,\u00a0 and\u00a0 to pay\u00a0 one-fourteenth part of the costs.<br\/><br\/>It appears f from the proofs adduced\u00a0 by the Government that on\u00a0 Sunday, the 6th of June, 1909, at about 10.30 o'clock at night, twenty-three\u00a0 of the soldiers composing the Second Company of\u00a0 Constabulary stationed at\u00a0 Davao mutinied. During the progress of the mutiny they shot Lieut. Antonio de Goicuria, one of the officers of said company, wounding him in\u00a0 the left leg.\u00a0 Having thrown off all control, they started\u00a0 to\u00a0 flee from the locality.\u00a0 For this purpose they divided\u00a0 themselves into two groups', one passing along Calle San Pedro and the other\u00a0 along.Calle Magallanes in said village.\u00a0 The group which\u00a0 passed along Calle San Pedro encountered Lieutenant De Balaine of the Constabulary and the governor of the district, Mr.\u00a0 Walker,\u00a0 at whom they fired several shots.\u00a0\u00a0 The soldiers thus mutinying, among whom were the fourteen appellants in this case, were\u00a0 under the leadership of Serg. Manuel Rodriguez, one of the appellants, and one Serg. Felix Academia.\u00a0 Having passed through the city in this manner, the two. groups united at the Davao ford and, crossing the river, marched to the mountains of Lipadas, where they remained\u00a0 until the 8th day of said month of June, on which date they returned and attacked the village of Davao.<br\/><br\/>That the appellants in this case mutinied against their superior officers in the manner described is unquestioned. Those of the accused who testified in their own behalf admitted the fact.\u00a0 So clear is the\u00a0 case that a detailed discussion\u00a0 of the facts would be idle.<br\/><br\/>No general defense was presented by the appellants,\u00a0\u00a0 Two or three, among them Manuel Rodriguez, asserted that they were forced to join the\u00a0 mutineers\u00a0 by Sergeant Academia, who seized\u00a0 them\u00a0 and under\u00a0 threat to kill them\u00a0 compelled them to go with him.\u00a0\u00a0 There is substantially nothing inv the evidence which justifies such defense.\u00a0\u00a0 Every act\u00a0 of those who set up such\u00a0 defense is distinctly in contradiction to the allegations.\u00a0\u00a0 That the\u00a0 appellants each and every one were\u00a0 guilty of mutiny, voluntarily and willfully, is so clear from\u00a0 the record as\u00a0 to make it entirely useless to\u00a0 detail the proofs.\u00a0\u00a0 The defendants generally,\u00a0 while not offering a defense, present as\u00a0 an excuse for the mutiny the abuse tp which they\u00a0 had been severally subjected at the hands\u00a0 of their superior\u00a0 officers, including Lieutenant De Goicuria, whom they assaulted and\u00a0 shot during the\u00a0 mutiny.\u00a0\u00a0 That they were treated harshly and were abused\u00a0 to some extent is unquestioned. Under all of the facts of the case, however, we\u00a0 are of the opinion that\u00a0 such\u00a0 treatriient ought not\u00a0 to weigh in favor of the appellants.\u00a0\u00a0 They had\u00a0 within\u00a0 their power a method by which such abuses could be\u00a0 corrected and this is the course that they should have followed.\u00a0 Their conduct during the\u00a0 mutiny, and the acts of spoliation and murder committed\u00a0 subsequent thereto, leave no\u00a0 room for leniency.<br\/><br\/>For these reasons, the judgment appealed from is affirmed, with the costs against the appellants.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Rep., 122).\u00a0\u00a0 No sufficient reason is presented why we should not follow\u00a0 the doctrine enunciated in that case.<\/p><p>The question raised in the second assignment of error is purely one of fact.\u00a0 Upon this point\u00a0 the trial court said:<\/p><p>\"For considerably more than a year\u00a0 previous to\u00a0 the filing of this complaint\u00a0 the\u00a0 accused had been a consumer\u00a0 of electricity furnished by the\u00a0 Manila Electric Railroad and Light Company for a building containing the residence\u00a0 of the accused\u00a0 and\u00a0 three other residences, and\u00a0 which was equipped, according to the defendant's testimony, with thirty electric lights.\u00a0 On March 15, 1909, the representatives\u00a0 of the company, believing that more light was being used than their meter showed, installed an additional meter\u00a0 (Exhibit A) on a pole outside of defendant's house, and both it and the meter (Exhibit B) which had been previously\u00a0 installed in the house\u00a0 were\u00a0 read\u00a0 on said date.\u00a0\u00a0 Exhibit\u00a0 A\u00a0 read 218 kilowatt hours; Exhibit B, 745 kilowatt hours.\u00a0\u00a0 On March 3, 1910, each was read again, Exhibit A showing 2,718 kilowatt hours and Exhibit B, 968. It is undisputed\u00a0 that the current which supplied\u00a0 the house passed through\u00a0 both meters and the\u00a0 city electrician\u00a0 testifies that each meter was tested on the date of the last\u00a0 reading and was \"in good condition.\"\u00a0 The result of this\u00a0 registration\u00a0 therefore is that while the outside meter\u00a0 (Exhibit A) showed a consumption in defendant's building of 2,500 kilowatt hours of electricity, the inside meter\u00a0 (Exhibit B)\u00a0 showed but 223\u00a0 kilowatt hours.\u00a0\u00a0 In other words the actual\u00a0 consumption, according to the outside meter, was more than ten times\u00a0 as\u00a0 great as that registered by the one\u00a0 inside.\u00a0 Obviously this difference could not be due to normal causes, for\u00a0 while the electrician called by\u00a0 the\u00a0 defense (Lanusa) testifies to the possibility of a difference between two such meters, he places the extreme limit of such difference between them at 5\u00a0 per cent. Here, as we have seen, the difference is more than 900 per cent.\u00a0 Besides, according to the defendant's electrician, the outside meter should normally run faster, while according to the test made in this case the inside meter (Exhibit B) ran\u00a0 the faster.\u00a0 The city electrician also testifies that the electric current could have been deflected from the inside meter by placing thereon a\u00a0 device known as\u00a0 a 'jumper' connecting the two\u00a0 outside wires, and there\u00a0 is\u00a0 other testimony that\u00a0 there were marks\u00a0 on the insulation of the meter Exhibit B which showed\u00a0 the use of such a device. There is\u00a0 further\u00a0 evidence that the consumption\u00a0 of 223 kilowatt hours,\u00a0 registered by the inside\u00a0 meter would not be a reasonable amount for the number of lights installed in defendant's building during the period in\u00a0 question, and the accused fails to explain why he should have had thirty lights installed if he needed fcjut four or five.<\/p><p>\"On the strength of this showing a search\u00a0 warrant was issued for the examination of defendant's premises and was duly served by a\u00a0 police officer (Hartpence).\u00a0 He was accompanied at the\u00a0 time by three employees of the Manila Electric Railroad and Light Company, and he found\u00a0 there the accused, his wife and son, and perhaps one or two others. There is a sharp conflict between the several spectators on some points but on one there is no dispute.\u00a0 All agree that the 'jumper'\u00a0 (Exhibit C) was\u00a0 found\u00a0 in a drawer\u00a0 of a small cabinet\u00a0 in the room of\u00a0 defendant's house where the meter\u00a0 was installed and not more than 20 feet\u00a0 therefrom. In the absence of a satisfactory explanation this constituted possession on\u00a0 defendant's part, and such possession, under the Code of Civil Procedure, section 334 (10), raises the presumption that the accused was the owner of a\u00a0 device whose only use was\u00a0 to deflect the current from\u00a0 the meter.<\/p><p>\"Is\u00a0 there\u00a0 any\u00a0 other 'satisfactory explanation'\u00a0 of the 'jumper's' presence?\u00a0 The only one sought to\u00a0 be offered is the statement by the son of the accused, a boy\u00a0 of twelve years,\u00a0 that he saw the 'jumper' placed there by the witness Porter, an employee\u00a0 of the Light Company.\u00a0 The boy is the only witness who so testifies and Porter himself squarely denies it.\u00a0\u00a0 We can not agree\u00a0 with counsel for the defend that the boy's interest in the outcome of this case is less than that of the witnesses\u00a0 for the prosecution.\u00a0\u00a0 It seems to us that his natural\u00a0 desire to shield his father would far outweigh any interest such\u00a0 an employee like Porter would have and which, at most, would be merely pecuniary.<\/p><p>\"There is, however,\u00a0 one witness whom so far as appears, has no\u00a0 interest in the matter whatsoever.\u00a0 This\u00a0 is officer Hartpence, who executed the search warrant.\u00a0 He testifies that after inspecting other articles and places in the building as he and\u00a0 the other spectators, including the accused, approached\u00a0 the cabinet in which\u00a0 the 'jumper' was found, the officer's\u00a0 attention was called to the defendant's appearance and the former noticed that the latter was\u00a0 becoming nervous.\u00a0 Where the only two witnesses who are supposed to know anything of the matter thus contradict each other this item of testimony by the officer is of more than ordinary significance; for if, as the accused claims, the 'jumper' was placed in the cabinet for the first time by Porter there would be no occasion\u00a0 for any change\u00a0 of demeanor on the part of the accused.\u00a0 We do not think that the officer's declination\u00a0 to\u00a0 wait\u00a0 until\u00a0 defendant\u00a0 should secure\u00a0 a notary public shows bias.\u00a0\u00a0 The presence of such an\u00a0 official was neither required nor authorized by law and the very efficacy of a search\u00a0 often depends upon its swiftness.<\/p><p>\"We must also agree with the prosecuting attorney that the attending circumstances do not strengthen the story told by\u00a0 the\u00a0 boy; that the latter would have been\u00a0 likely to call out at the time he saw the\u00a0 'jumper'\u00a0 being placed in the drawer,\u00a0 or at least directed his father's attention to it immediately instead of waiting, as he says, until the latter was called by the officer.\u00a0 Finally, to accept the boy's story we must believe that this company or its representatives deliberately\u00a0 conspired not merely to lure the defendant into the commission of a crime but to fasten\u00a0 upon him a crime which he did not commit and thus\u00a0 convict an innocent man by perjured\u00a0 evidence.\u00a0 This is a much more serious charge than that contained in the complaint and should be supported by\u00a0 very strong\u00a0 corroborating circumstances which we do not find here.\u00a0 We are, accordingly, unable to consider as satisfactory\u00a0 defendant's\u00a0 explanation of\u00a0 the\u00a0 'jumper's' presence.\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"The only alternative is the conclusion that the 'jumper' was placed there by the accused or by some one acting for him and that it was the instrument by\u00a0 which the current was deflected from the\u00a0 meter\u00a0 Exhibit\u00a0 B and the Light Company deprived of its\u00a0 lawful compensation.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>After a careful examination of the entire record we are satisfied beyond peradventure of a\u00a0 doubt\u00a0 that the proofs presented fully support the facts as set\u00a0 forth in the\u00a0 foregoing finding.<\/p><p>Counsel for the appellant insists that only corporeal property can be the\u00a0 subject of the crime of\u00a0 larceny,\u00a0 and m support of this proposition cites several authorities for the purpose of\u00a0 showing that\u00a0 the\u00a0 only subjects of larceny are tangible, movable, chattels, something which could be taken in possession and carried away, and which had some, although trifling, intrinsic value, and also\u00a0 to show that electricity is an unknown force and can\u00a0 not\u00a0 be\u00a0 a subject of larceny.<\/p><p>In the case of U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Genato\u00a0 (15\u00a0 Phil. Rep., 170) the defendant, the owner of the store situated at No. 154 Escolta, Manila, was using a contrivance known as a \"jumper\" on the electric meter installed by the Manila Electric\u00a0 Railroad and Light\u00a0 Company.\u00a0 As a result\u00a0 of the use of this \"jumper\" the meter,\u00a0 instead of making one revolution in every four seconds, registered\u00a0 one in seventy-seven seconds, thereby\u00a0 reducing\u00a0 the current approximately 95 per\u00a0 cent. Genato was\u00a0 charged in the municipal court with a violation of a certain ordinance of the city of Manila, and was sentenced\u00a0 to pay a fine of P200.\u00a0 He appealed to\u00a0 the Court of First Instance, was again tried and sentenced to pay the same fine.\u00a0\u00a0 An appeal was taken from the judgment of the Court of First Instance to the Supreme Court on the ground that the ordinance in question was null and\u00a0 void. It is true that the\u00a0 only\u00a0 question directly presented was that\u00a0 of the validity of the city ordinance.\u00a0 The court,\u00a0 after holding that said ordinance was valid, said:\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"Even without them\u00a0 (ordinances), the right of ownership of electric current\u00a0 is secured by articles 517 and 518\u00a0 of the Penal Code; the application\u00a0 of\u00a0 these\u00a0 articles\u00a0 in cases of substraction of gas, a fluid used for lighting, and in some respects resembling electricity, is confirmed by the rule laid down in the decisions of the supreme court of Spain January 20,\u00a0 1887, and April 1,\u00a0 1897,\u00a0 construing and\u00a0 enforcing the provisions of articles 530 and 531 of the penal code of that country, articles identical with articles 517 and 518\u00a0 of the code in force in these Islands.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Article 517 of the Penal Code above referred to\u00a0 reads as follows:<\/p><p>\"The following are guilty of larceny:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\" (1)\u00a0 Those who with intent of gain and without violence or intimidation\u00a0 against the person, or force against things, shall take another's personal property without the\u00a0 owner's consent.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>And article 518 fixes the penalty for larceny in proportion to the value of the personal property stolen.<\/p><p>It is\u00a0 true that electricity is no longer,\u00a0 as\u00a0 formerly, regarded by electricians as a fluid, but its manifestations and effects,\u00a0 like those of gas, may be seen and felt.. The true test\u00a0 of what is a proper subject of larceny seems to be not whether the subject is corporeal or incorporeal, but whether it is\u00a0 capable of appropriation by another than the owner.<\/p><p>It is well-settled that illuminating gas may be the subject of larceny, even in the absence of a statute\u00a0 so providing.

Rep., 385, and 25 Cyc, p. 12, note 10.)<\/p><p>In the case of Commonwealth vs. Shaw, supra, the court, speaking through Chief Justice Bigelow, said:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"There is nothing in the nature of gas\u00a0 used for illuminating purposes which\u00a0 renders\u00a0 it incapable of being feloniously taken\u00a0 and carried away.\u00a0 It is a\u00a0 valuable article of merchandise, bought and sold like other personal property, susceptible of being\u00a0 severed from a mass or larger quantity, and of being transported from place to place.\u00a0 In the present case it appears that it was the property of the Boston Gas Light Company; that it was in their possession by being confined in conduits and tubes which belonged to them, and that the defendant\u00a0 severed a\u00a0 portion of that which was in\u00a0 the\u00a0 pipes of the company by taking it into her house and\u00a0 there consuming it.\u00a0 All this being proved to have been done by her secretly and with intent to deprive the company of their property and to appropriate it to her own use, clearly constitutes the crime of larceny.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Electricity,\u00a0 the\u00a0 same as gas, is\u00a0 a valuable article\u00a0 of merchandise, bought and sold\u00a0 like other personal property and is capable\u00a0 of appropriation by another.\u00a0 So no error was committed by the trial court in holding that electricity is a subject of larceny.<\/p><p>It is urged in support of the fourth assignment of error that if it be true that the appellant did appropriate to his own use\u00a0 the electricity as charged he can not be held guilty of larceny for any part of the electricity thus appropriated, after the first month, for the\u00a0 reason\u00a0 that\u00a0 the complaining party,\u00a0 the Manila Electric Railroad\u00a0 and Light Company, knew of this misappropriation and consented thereto.<\/p><p>The outside meter was installed on March 15, 1909, and read 218 kilowatt hours.\u00a0 On the same day\u00a0 the inside meter was\u00a0 read and\u00a0 showed\u00a0 745 kilowatt\u00a0 hours.\u00a0 Both meters were again\u00a0 read pn \/March 3, 1910, and\u00a0 the\u00a0 outside one showed\u00a0 2,718 kilowatt hours while the one on the inside only showed 968, the difference in consumption during this time being 2,277 kilowatt hours.\u00a0 The taking of this current continued\u00a0 over a period of\u00a0 one year, less twelve days. Assuming that the company read both meters at the end of\u00a0 each month;\u00a0 that\u00a0 it knew the defendant was misappropriating the current to that extent; and that it continued to furnish the current, thereby giving the defendant an\u00a0 opportunity to continue the\u00a0 misappropriation,\u00a0 still, we think, that the defendant is criminally responsible for the taking\u00a0 of the whole\u00a0 amount, 2,277 kilowatt hours.\u00a0 The company had a\u00a0 contract with\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant to furnish him with current for lighting purposes.\u00a0 It could\u00a0 not stop the misappropriation without cutting off the current entirely.\u00a0 It could not reduce the current so as to just furnish sufficient for the lighting of two, three, or five lights, as claimed by the defendant that he used during the most of this time, but the current must always be sufficiently strong to furnish current for the thirty lights, at any time the defendant desired to use them.<\/p><p>There is no\u00a0 pretense that the accused was solicited by the company or any one else to commit the acts charged. At\u00a0 most there was a mere passive submission on the part of the company that\u00a0 the current should be taken and no indication that\u00a0 it wished it\u00a0 to be taken, and no knowledge by\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant that the company wished him\u00a0 to take the current,\u00a0 and\u00a0 no\u00a0 mutual\u00a0 understanding between\u00a0 the company\u00a0 and the\u00a0 defendant, and no measures of inducement of any\u00a0 kind were employed by the company for the purpose of leading the defendant into temptation, and no preconcert whatever between him and the\u00a0 company.\u00a0 The original design\u00a0 to misappropriate this current was formed by the defendant absolutely independent of any acts on the part of the company or its agents.\u00a0 It is true, no doubt, as a general proposition, that larceny is not committed when the property\u00a0 is taken\u00a0 with the\u00a0 consent\u00a0 of\u00a0 its owner.\u00a0 It may be difficult in some\u00a0 instances to determine whether certain acts constitute, in law, such \"consent.\"\u00a0 But under the facts in the case at bar it is not difficult to reach a conclusion that the acts performed by the plaintiff company did not constitute a consent on its part that the defendant take its property.\u00a0 We have been unable to find\u00a0 a well-considered case holding a contrary opinion under similar facts, but, there are numerous cases holding that such acts do not\u00a0 constitute\u00a0 such consent as\u00a0 would relieve the taker of criminal responsibility.\u00a0 The fourth assignment of error is, therefore, not well founded.<\/p><p>It is also contended that since the \"jumper\" was not used continuously, the defendant committed not a single offense but a series of offenses.\u00a0 It is, no\u00a0 doubt,\u00a0 true that\u00a0 the defendant did\u00a0 not allow the \"jumper\" to remain in place continuously for any number of days as the company inspected monthly the inside meter.\u00a0\u00a0 So the \"jumper\" was put on and taken off at least monthly, if not daily, in order to\u00a0 avoid\u00a0 detection, and while the \"jumper\" was\u00a0 off\u00a0 the defendant was not misappropriating the current.\u00a0 The complaint alleged that\u00a0 the defendant did on, during, and between the 13th day of February, 1909, and the 3d of March, 1910, willfully,\u00a0 unlawfully, and feloniously\u00a0 take, steal, and\u00a0 carry away 2,277 kilowatts\u00a0 of electric current of\u00a0 the value of P909.\u00a0\u00a0 No demurrer was presented against this complaint on the\u00a0 ground\u00a0 that\u00a0 more than\u00a0 one crime\u00a0 was charged. The Government had no opportunity to amend or\u00a0 correct this error, if error at all.\u00a0 In the case of U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Macaspac (12 Phil. Rep., 26), the defendant\u00a0 received from one Joaquina Punu the sum of P31.50, with the request to deliver it\u00a0 to Marcelina Dy-Oco.\u00a0 The defendant called upon Marcelina, but instead of delivering the said amount she asked Marcelina for P30 in\u00a0 the name\u00a0 of Joaquina who\u00a0 had in no way authorized her to do so.\u00a0 Marcelina gave her P30, believing\u00a0 that Joaquina had\u00a0 sent for it.\u00a0 Counsel for the defendant\u00a0 insisted that the\u00a0 complaint\u00a0 charged his client with two\u00a0 different crimes of <em>estafa<\/em>\u00a0 in violation of section 11 of General Orders, No. 58.\u00a0 In disposing of this question this court said:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"The said defect constitutes one of the dilatory\u00a0 pleas indicated\u00a0 by section 21,\u00a0 and the accused ought to\u00a0 have raised\u00a0 the point before the\u00a0 trial began.\u00a0 Had this\u00a0 been done, the complaint might have been amended in\u00a0 time, because it is\u00a0 merely\u00a0 a defect of\u00a0 form\u00a0 easily remedied. *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 Inasmuch as in the first instance the accused did not make the corresponding dilatory plea to the irregularity of the complaint, it\u00a0 must be understood that she has waived such objection, and is not now entitled to raise for the first time\u00a0 any question in reference thereto when submitting to this court\u00a0 her\u00a0 assignment of errors.\u00a0\u00a0 Apart from the fact that the defense does not pretend that any of the essential rights of the accused have been injured, the allegation of the defect above alluded to, which in any case would only affect the form of the complaint, can not justify a reversal of the judgment appealed from, according to the provisions of section 10\u00a0 of General Orders, No. 58.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>In the case at bar it is not pointed out wherein any of the essential rights of\u00a0 the defendant have\u00a0 been prejudiced by reason of the fact that the complaint covered the entire period.\u00a0\u00a0 If twelve distinct and separate complaints had been filed against the defendant, one for each month, the sum total of the penalties imposed might have been verv much greater than that imposed by the court in this case.\u00a0 The covering of the entire period by one charge lias been beneficial, if anything,\u00a0 and not prejudicial.to the rights of the defendant.\u00a0 The prosecuting attorney elected to cover the entire period with one\u00a0 charge and the accused having been convicted for this\u00a0 offense, he can not again be prosecuted for the stealing of the\u00a0 current at any time within that period.\u00a0\u00a0 Then, again, we are\u00a0 of the opinion that the charge was properly laid.\u00a0\u00a0 The electricity was stolen from the same person, in the\u00a0 same manner, and in the\u00a0 same place.\u00a0 It was substantially one continuous act, although the \"jumper\" might have been removed and replaced daily or monthly. The defendant was moved by one impulse to appropriate to his own\u00a0 use the current, and\u00a0 the means adopted by him for the taking\u00a0 of the\u00a0 current were\u00a0 in\u00a0 the execution of a general fraudulent plan.<\/p><p>\"A person stole\u00a0 gas for the use\u00a0 of\u00a0 a manufactory\u00a0 by means\u00a0 of a pipe, which\u00a0 drew\u00a0 off\u00a0 the\u00a0 gas from the main without allowing it to pass through the meter.\u00a0 The gas from this pipe\u00a0 was burnt every\u00a0 day,\u00a0 and turned off\u00a0 at night.\u00a0 The pipe was never closed at its junction with the main, and consequently always remained full of gas.\u00a0 It was held, that if the\u00a0 pipe always remained full, there was, in fact,\u00a0 a continuous taking\u00a0 of the gas\u00a0 and not a series of separate takings.\u00a0 It was held also that even if the pipe had not\u00a0 been\u00a0 kept full, the taking would have been continuous, as\u00a0 it was substantially all one transaction.\"\u00a0 (Regina <em>vs,<\/em>.

Has it proved, even,\u00a0 that the accused did not have a right to use a\u00a0 \"jumper?\"\u00a0\u00a0 Has it been proved that the company has not been\u00a0 fully paid for all the electricity which defendant used, however\u00a0 obtained ?\u00a0\u00a0 Not one of these facts\u00a0 has been proved.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 only way to\u00a0 determine\u00a0 those questions was to ascertain the relations which\u00a0 existed between\u00a0 the accused and the company at the time the electricity alleged to have been stolen was used by the accused.\u00a0 There was certainly some relation, some\u00a0 contract,\u00a0 either\u00a0 express or implied, between the\u00a0 company and the accused or the company would not have been supplying him the electric current.\u00a0 What was that relation, that contract?\u00a0 No one\u00a0 can possibly tell by reading the record.\u00a0 There is riot a single word\u00a0 in all the evidence even referring to it.\u00a0\u00a0 Not one of the people's witnesses mentioned it.\u00a0 Not one of them, very likely, knew what it really was.\u00a0\u00a0 The relation which a corporation bears to private persons for whom they are rendering\u00a0 service is determined by\u00a0 the\u00a0 corporation\u00a0 itself through the acts\u00a0 of its\u00a0 <em>officials<\/em>,\u00a0 and not by its <em>employees.<\/em> While an employee might, as the act of a servant, have caused the contract between the company and the accused to be signed by the accused, it was nevertheless a contract determined and prepared by the company through its officers and not\u00a0 one made\u00a0 by the\u00a0 employee; and unless the employee actually knew\u00a0 the terms of the contract signed by the accused, either by having read it, if in writing, or by having heard\u00a0 it agreed upon,\u00a0 if verbal, he would not be competent to testify to its\u00a0 terms except rendered so by admission of the party to be charged by it.\u00a0 It nowhere appears that any of the\u00a0 witnesses for the prosecution had any\u00a0 knowledge whatever\u00a0 of\u00a0 the terms\u00a0 of the contract between the company and the\u00a0 accused.\u00a0 It does not appear that any of them\u00a0 had ever\u00a0 seen it or heard it talked about by either party thereto.\u00a0 The\u00a0 company has offered no testimony whatever on that matter.\u00a0\u00a0 The record is absolutely silent on that point.<\/p><p>This being true, how can we say that the accused committed a crime?\u00a0\u00a0 How can we say\u00a0 that a given act is criminal unless we know\u00a0 the relation\u00a0 of the parties to whom the act refers?\u00a0 Are we to<em> presume <\/em> an act wrong.\u00a0 Are\u00a0 we to say that\u00a0 the\u00a0 accused committed a wrong <em>when we do not know whether he did. or not?<\/em>\u00a0 If we do not know the arrangements under which the company undertook to furnish electricity to the defendant,\u00a0 how do\u00a0 we know that the\u00a0 accused has not lived up to them? If we\u00a0 do not know their contract, how do we know that the\u00a0 accused violated it?<\/p><p>It may be urged that the\u00a0 very fact\u00a0 that a meter\u00a0 was put in by the\u00a0 company\u00a0 is evidence that it was for the company's protection.\u00a0 This may be\u00a0 true.\u00a0\u00a0 But is it not just\u00a0 as proper\u00a0 to presume\u00a0 that it was put in for\u00a0 defendant's protection also?\u00a0 Besides, it does not appear that the company really put in the meter, nor does it even appear to whom it belonged.\u00a0 No\u00a0 more does it appear\u00a0 on whose application\u00a0 it was put in.\u00a0 The witness who installed the meter in defendant's house did not say to whom it belonged and was unable to identify the one presented by the prosecution on the trial as the one he installed.\u00a0 But however these things may be, courts are not justified\u00a0 in \"assuming\" men into state prison.\u00a0\u00a0 The only inferences that courts are justified in\u00a0 drawing are those springing from\u00a0 <em>facts<\/em> which are not only\u00a0 but which are of themselves <em>sufficient<\/em> to <em>warrant\u00a0 the\u00a0 inference<\/em>.\u00a0\u00a0 The mere fact, if\u00a0 it is a\u00a0 fact, that the company placed a meter in defendant's house is not sufficient\u00a0 to sustain the conclusion in a criminal\u00a0 case that the defendant did not have the right to use electricity which did not pass through the meter.\u00a0 Much less would it warrant the inference that, in\u00a0 so using electricity, the defendant feloniously and criminally took, stole, and carried it away<em> without the consent of the company<\/em>.\u00a0 An accused is presumed innocent\u00a0 until\u00a0 the contrary\u00a0 is proved.\u00a0\u00a0 His guilt must be established beyond a reasonable\u00a0 doubt.\u00a0 It is incumbent\u00a0 on the\u00a0 state\u00a0 to prove every\u00a0 fact which is essential to the guilt\u00a0 of the\u00a0 accused, and to prove every such fact as though the whole issue\u00a0 rested on it.\u00a0 The evidence\u00a0 of the\u00a0 prosecution\u00a0 mfust exclude every reasonable hypothesis\u00a0 of innocence.\u00a0 If the facts\u00a0 proved\u00a0 are as\u00a0 consistent with his innocence as\u00a0 with his guilt,\u00a0 he can not be convicted.<\/p><p>But what was\u00a0 the\u00a0 necessity of all this uncertainty? What was\u00a0 the force\u00a0 which\u00a0 prevented\u00a0 the company from proving clearly\u00a0 and explicitly the contract between\u00a0 itself and the accused?\u00a0 What prevented it from proving clearly, explicitly, and beyond all cavil that the electricity was taken (used) without its consent?\u00a0\u00a0 Why did not some\u00a0 competent official testify?\u00a0 Why\u00a0 did the\u00a0 company stand by wholly silent?\u00a0 Why\u00a0 did it leave its case to be proved by servants who were competent to testify, and who did actually testify, so far as legal evidence goes, only in\u00a0 relation to technical\u00a0 matters relating to meters\u00a0 and\u00a0 electric\u00a0 currents? Why did the prosecution place upon this court the necessity of deducing and inferring and concluding relative to the lack of consent of the company when a single word from the company\u00a0 itself\u00a0 would\u00a0 have avoided that\u00a0 necessity? We have only one answer to alJ these questions: We do not know.<\/p><p>In the case of Bubster <em>vs.<\/em> Nebraska (33 Neb., 663), the accused was charged with the larceny of a buggy of the value of $75.\u00a0 He was found guilty.\u00a0 On appeal the judgment of conviction was reversed, the court saying:<\/p><p>\"There are two serious objections to this verdict.\u00a0 First, the owner of the buggy, although apparently within reach of the process of the court,\u00a0 was not called as\u00a0 a\u00a0 witness.

He was convicted. On appeal the\u00a0 court\u00a0 reversed the judgment\u00a0 of conviction, saying:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"In State <em>vs.<\/em> Morey (2 Wis., 494) it was held that in prosecutions for larceny, if the owner of the property alleged to\u00a0 have been stolen\u00a0 is known, and his attendance as a witness can be\u00a0 procured, his testimony that the property was taken from him without his consent is indispensable to a conviction.\u00a0 This is upon the principle that his testimony is the\u00a0 primary\u00a0 and best\u00a0 evidence that the\u00a0 property was taken without his consent, and hence, that secondary evidence of the fact cannot be resorted to, until the prosecution shows its inability, after due diligence, to procure the attendance of the owner.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>In volume 1, Phillips on Evidence\u00a0 (5th Am. ed., note 183, sec. 635), the author says:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"In\u00a0 all cases, and\u00a0 especially in this, the larceny itself must be proved\u00a0 by the best evidence the nature of the case admits.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 This should be by the testimony of the owner himself if the property was\u00a0 taken from\u00a0 his immediate possession, or if from the actual possession of another, though a mere\u00a0 servant or child\u00a0 of\u00a0 the owner, that other must be\u00a0 sworn,\u00a0 so that it may appear\u00a0 that the\u00a0 immediate possession was violated, and this, too, without the consent of the person holding it.\u00a0\u00a0 Where non-consent is an essential ingredient in\u00a0 the offense, as it is here, direct\u00a0 proof alone, from\u00a0 the\u00a0 person whose non-consent is necessary, can satisfy the rule.\u00a0 You are to prove a negative, and the very person who can swear directly to the necessary negative must,\u00a0 if\u00a0 possible, always be\u00a0 produced.\u00a0\u00a0 (Citing\u00a0 English authorities.)\u00a0 Other and inferior proof cannot be resorted to till\u00a0 it\u00a0 be impossible to procure this best evidence.\u00a0 If one person be dead who can swear directly to the negative, and another be alive who\u00a0 can yet swear to the same thing, he must\u00a0 be\u00a0 produced.\u00a0 In such\u00a0 cases,\u00a0 mere presumption, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">prima\u00a0 facie<\/span> or\u00a0 circumstantial evidence\u00a0 is\u00a0 secondary\u00a0 in degree, and\u00a0 cannot be used until all the\u00a0 sources of direct evidence\u00a0 are exhausted.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>I quote these authorities not because I agree with the doctrine\u00a0 as\u00a0 therein\u00a0 set forth.\u00a0 I\u00a0 quote\u00a0 them because there is a principle inherent\u00a0 in the doctrine laid down which is recognized by all courts as having value\u00a0 and effect.\u00a0 It is this: Failure to call an available witness possessing peculiar knowledge concerning facts essential to a party's case, direct\u00a0 or\u00a0 rebutting, or to\u00a0 examine such witness as\u00a0 to facts covered by his special knowledge, especially if the witness be naturally favorable to the party's\u00a0 contention,\u00a0 relying instead upon the evidence of witnesses less familiar with the matter,\u00a0 gives rise to\u00a0 an inference, sometimes denominated a strong presumption of law, that the testimony of such uninterrogated witness would not sustain the contention of the party.\u00a0 Where the party himself is the one who fails to appear or testify,\u00a0 the inference is still stronger. The nonappearance of a litigant or his failure to testify as to facts material to his case and as to which he\u00a0 has especially full knowledge creates an inference that he refrains from appearing or testifying because the\u00a0 truth, if made to appear, would not\u00a0 aid his contention; and, in connection with an\u00a0 unequivocal statement on the other side, which if untrue could be disproved by his testimony,\u00a0 often furnishes strong evidence of the fact asserted.\u00a0 As to this proposition the authorities are substantially uniform.\u00a0 They differ only in the cases to which the principles are applied. A substantially full list\u00a0 of the authorities\u00a0 is given in\u00a0 16 Cyclopedia of Law and Procedure\u00a0 (pp. 1062 to 1064, inclusive)\u00a0 from which the rules\u00a0 as stated above are taken.<\/p><p>This court has recognized the value of this principle and has permitted it strongly to influence its view of the evidence in certain cases.\u00a0\u00a0 In the\u00a0 case of\u00a0 United States <em>vs.<\/em> Magsipoc (20 Phil, Rep., 604) one of the vital facts which the prosecution was required to establish in order to convict the accused was that a\u00a0 certain letter which the accused alleged\u00a0 he mailed to his daughter, who was attending a boarding school in Iloilo, and which the daughter testified she had received, had not really been\u00a0 sent by\u00a0 the accused and received by\u00a0 the daughter but, instead,\u00a0 had been\u00a0 purloined by him from the post-office after he had duly placed it therein and after it had been taken into the custody and control of the postal authorities.\u00a0 It was conceded that the directress of the boarding\u00a0 school which\u00a0 the daughter was at the time attending knew\u00a0 positively whether the daughter had received the\u00a0 letter in question or not.\u00a0 This court held that, in weighing the evidence, it would take into consideration the failure of the prosecution to produce the directress of the school as a witness in\u00a0 the case,\u00a0 she being the only person, apart from the daughter herself, who really knew the fact.<\/p><p>Another of those cases was that of U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Casipong (20 Phil. Rep., 178) charged with maintaining a concubine outside his home with public\u00a0 scandal.\u00a0 To prove\u00a0 the scandalous conduct charged and its\u00a0 publicity, the prosecution introduced testimony, not of witnesses in the vicinity where the\u00a0 accused\u00a0 resided\u00a0 and\u00a0 where the\u00a0 scandal\u00a0 was\u00a0 alleged to have occurred, but those from another barrio.\u00a0\u00a0 No witness living in the locality where\u00a0 the public\u00a0 scandal was alleged to have\u00a0 occurred was\u00a0 produced.\u00a0\u00a0 This\u00a0 court,\u00a0 in the decision of that case on appeal, allowed itself, in weighing the evidence of the prosecution, to be strongly influenced by the failure to produce as witnesses persons who, if there had really been public scandal, would have been the first, if not the only ones, to know it.\u00a0 The court said:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"In this case it would have been easy to have submitted abundant evidence\u00a0 that Juan\u00a0 Casipong forsook his lawful wife and lived in concubinage in the village of Bolocboloc with his paramour\u00a0 Gregoria Hongoy, for there would have been an excess of witnesses to testify regarding the actions performed by the defendants,\u00a0 actions not of isolated occurrence but carried on for many days\u00a0 in sight of numerous residents scandalized by their bad example.\u00a0 But\u00a0 it is impossible\u00a0 to conclude from the result of the\u00a0 trial\u00a0 that the concubinage\u00a0 with scandal\u00a0 charged against the defendants has\u00a0 been proved, and therefore\u00a0 conviction\u00a0 of the alleged concubine Gregoria Hongoy is not according\u00a0 to law,\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>In\u00a0 the\u00a0 case at bar the question of the consent\u00a0 of the company to the use of the electricity was the\u00a0 essence of the charge.\u00a0 The defendant denied that he had taken\u00a0 the electricity without the consent of the company.\u00a0 The\u00a0 prosecution\u00a0 did not present any officer of the corporation\u00a0 to offset this\u00a0 denial and the company itself, although represented on the trial by its own private counsel, did not produce a single witness upon that subject.<\/p><p>In the case of Standard Oil Co. <em>vs<\/em>.

In the second place, if\u00a0 electricity is, in\u00a0 the\u00a0 real sense of that term, separable from the object to\u00a0 which it belongs, then it must\u00a0 be admitted that it is capable of a separate and\u00a0 independent existence apart from any\u00a0 other object. This is not so.\u00a0 It is not only admitted\u00a0 but\u00a0 contended by\u00a0 every scientist who has touched this subject that electricity is incapable of an\u00a0 independent existence apart from some given material object.\u00a0\u00a0 In the third place, this argument overlooks the fact, even if we assume that it can be separated, that the thing when separated is not the same thing that it\u00a0 was before\u00a0 separation; in\u00a0 other words,\u00a0 when the so-called separation occurs there is\u00a0 not only a transference of energy from the horse to the\u00a0 battery but there is\u00a0 also a <em>transformation<\/em>.\u00a0 In the horse it is muscular energy.\u00a0 In the wire it is\u00a0 electrical energy.\u00a0 In the horse it is potential. In the wire, kinetic. It is not the\u00a0 same\u00a0 thing in the wire that it was in the horse.\u00a0\u00a0 In the fourth place, the argument makes the stealability of a thing\u00a0 depend not on its nature but on where it is located.\u00a0 This is an assumption wholly unwarranted and impossible\u00a0 under the law.\u00a0\u00a0 To say that whether or not a thing is stealable depends not on its nature but on\u00a0 where it is located is absurd.\u00a0 A diamond ring in a burglar-proof safe is as much a subject of larceny, under the definition of the law, as\u00a0 if it lay in an open showcase. If energy is stealable at all, and\u00a0 it must\u00a0 be remembered that I am proceeding, as we must necessarily proceed, upon the <em>accepted theory<\/em> that electricity is nothing more or less than energy, it is so by reason of its <em>nature<\/em> and not by reason of its residing in a battery rather than in a horse; and if it is stealable by virtue of its <em>nature<\/em>\u00a0 it can be stolen from the horse as well as from the battery or\u00a0 wire.\u00a0 A thing is subject to larceny because, and only\u00a0 because, it is a <em>cosa mueble<\/em>, not because it is inside a horse,\u00a0 a wire or a safe.\u00a0\u00a0 If it is a<em> cosa mueble<\/em> it is the subject of larceny although it be\u00a0 located on the moon; and if\u00a0 it is <em>not a cosa mueble<\/em>\u00a0 it is not subject\u00a0 to\u00a0 larceny\u00a0 although it be placed in a den\u00a0 of\u00a0 thieves.\u00a0\u00a0 The difficulty\u00a0 or ease\u00a0 of getting at a thing has\u00a0 nothing whatever to do with\u00a0 its stealability. In the fifth place, this argument overlooks the very important fact, to be dealt with more at\u00a0 length later, that the electric\u00a0 current used\u00a0 by the accused was returned to the company, after use, absolutely undiminished in quantity.<\/p><p>What then,\u00a0 is the difference between corn, for example, and an\u00a0 electric current?\u00a0 It\u00a0 is this.\u00a0 One is a <em>cosa wueble<\/em> while the other is not; one is produced by a\u00a0 <em>wholly different process<\/em>\u00a0 from the other and from <em>wholly different materials<\/em>, if we may call\u00a0 <em>materials<\/em> those changes which result in the <em>immaterial<\/em> thing called an electric current; in the case of corn we deal not with\u00a0 the <em>quality or energy <\/em>of corn, <em> but with corn as a\u00a0 composite and concrete result of all its qualities and\u00a0 uses; <\/em> we deal with a <em> tangible thing<\/em>,\u00a0 a <em>chattel,<\/em> and\u00a0 not with a\u00a0 <em>condition<\/em> or <em>quality<\/em> of a\u00a0 tangible thing; we\u00a0 deal with things instead of <em>ideas<\/em>,\u00a0 with\u00a0 things which exist <em>separate<\/em> and <em>independent <\/em>and which\u00a0 do not depend, as does electricity, wholly upon some body\u00a0 not only for the capability of <em>manifesting<\/em> its existence, <em>but also for very existence\u00a0 itself;<\/em>\u00a0 because we deal with something which changes its <em>form<\/em> but never its <em>nature as a physical entity.<\/em> It is always a <em>chattel<\/em>, a <em>tangible thing<\/em>, a <em>cosa mueble. <\/em><\/p><p>On the other hand, in the case of the electric current we deal not with\u00a0 a thing, a\u00a0 chattel, a <em>cosa\u00a0 mueble<\/em>, but\u00a0 with a <em>condition or quality, a property of a cosa mueble;<\/em> with an idea which always, before it has\u00a0 any\u00a0 significance or meaning whatever,\u00a0 associates itself with\u00a0 an entity, a body\u00a0 or chattel, as a <em>characteristic<\/em> or <em>quality<\/em> of such body or chattel; with lines of force which are merely and solely a quality, a <em>property<\/em>, a <em>characteristic<\/em> of the magnet, instead of\u00a0 with grains of corn which are\u00a0 absolute entities, independent of and apart from everything else, and\u00a0 not mere <em>characteristics<\/em> or <em>qualities<\/em> of\u00a0 some entity\u00a0 or body which does\u00a0 exist as\u00a0 an absolute physical entity in itself; with the rose and the violet and not their <em>perfume<\/em>; with the lily and not its beauty; with the clouds and not\u00a0 their <em>color;<\/em>\u00a0 with entities and not accidents; with realities and not the\u00a0 imponderable, impalpable <em>ideas<\/em> and <em>qualities<\/em> which <em>make up <\/em>the reality.<\/p><p>As has already been said, the difficulty in the elucidation of the question comes from the confusion of\u00a0 <em>qualities<\/em> with <em>things,<\/em>\u00a0 of <em>appearances<\/em> with <em>realities<\/em>. Apparently an electric current does\u00a0 things.\u00a0 It produces phenomena.\u00a0 It, therefore, <em> appears to be something.\u00a0 <\/em> But it\u00a0 must not be forgotten that many times appearances are deceitful.\u00a0 They do\u00a0 not always insure\u00a0 realities.\u00a0\u00a0 It is not judicial to say that, because a thing <em>looks<\/em>\u00a0 so, it <em>is<\/em> so.\u00a0\u00a0 It is not judicial to say that,\u00a0 simply because it looks\u00a0 as if one\u00a0 committed larceny, therefore he is <em>guilty<\/em>\u00a0 of\u00a0 larceny.\u00a0 Before we\u00a0 may <em>legally<\/em> convict one of larceny,\u00a0 we must know\u00a0 exactly what he\u00a0 did.\u00a0 Justice\u00a0 is\u00a0 not founded on\u00a0 guess work\u00a0 nor on appearances.\u00a0 Men's\u00a0 rights are preserved by definitions, and definitions are founded on facts,\u00a0 not fancies,\u00a0 on realities, not appearances.\u00a0 Because, when one taps an electrically charged wire belonging to another and,\u00a0 by means of a contrivance, transfers the charge to his own\u00a0 uses, it <em>looks<\/em> as if he was\u00a0 <em>stealing\u00a0 something,<\/em> is not sufficient to\u00a0 convict him of larceny.\u00a0\u00a0 We must first know what larceny is, as well as what an electric current is, and what is meant by its use in producing light.\u00a0 To know what larceny is we must know what legislators and Judges during the development of jurisprudence\u00a0 have always <em>said<\/em> and\u00a0 <em>agreed <\/em>it\u00a0 is.\u00a0\u00a0 In other words,\u00a0 we must know\u00a0 its\u00a0 <em>definition.<\/em>\u00a0 It approaches tyranny to convict one of murder when he is actually guilty of homicide only.\u00a0\u00a0 Yet the only thing which separates the two crimes is a definition. It is wrong\u00a0 to\u00a0 convict one of robbery who is guilty only of larceny.\u00a0 Yet these two crimes are distinguished\u00a0 only by a definition.\u00a0 If,\u00a0 as in the case at bar, whether or not one is declared a\u00a0 felon and\u00a0 is sent to prison for one\u00a0 year eight\u00a0 months and twenty-one days, is\u00a0 forever disqualified from\u00a0 holding\u00a0 public\u00a0 office and\u00a0 of exercising the\u00a0 right of suffrage, or whether, instead,\u00a0 he is\u00a0 declared guilty of a misdemeanor simply and punished lightly\u00a0 with\u00a0 no accompanying\u00a0 disqualifications, depends upon whether he has\u00a0 committed\u00a0 larceny as\u00a0 defined\u00a0 by\u00a0 the Penal Code or whether he has merely violated a city ordinance, the question whether <em>he actually committed larceny<\/em> or not\u00a0 begins to assume importance.\u00a0 It assumes\u00a0 importance not\u00a0 only\u00a0 to him but to society\u00a0 as\u00a0 well.\u00a0 If a court today palpably modifies a definition\u00a0 in\u00a0 order to\u00a0 convict an offender of\u00a0 larceny, how\u00a0 can society be assured that tomorrow the same court will\u00a0 not modify some other definition to convict a citizen of treason?\u00a0 When definitions are destroyed no man is secure in his person or his property. When men act\u00a0 on appearances instead of realities justice will be shortlived.\u00a0 A whale looks like a fish, acts like a fish, swims like a\u00a0 fish\u00a0 and lives all its life in the\u00a0 water like a\u00a0 fish.\u00a0 But it is\u00a0 not\u00a0 a fish.\u00a0 It is\u00a0 an animal.\u00a0\u00a0 It\u00a0 is air-breathing,\u00a0 warm-blooded, and viviparous, and suckles\u00a0 its young.\u00a0\u00a0 Now, if whether or\u00a0 not a whale is\u00a0 a\u00a0 fish or\u00a0 an animal is the potent factor determining whether a man goes to state\u00a0 prison\u00a0 as a felon with\u00a0 all the\u00a0 deplorable\u00a0 consequences resulting,\u00a0 or whether he is lightly sentenced as a mere misdemeanant, is\u00a0 it not of the supremest importance to determine whether a whale is a fish or an animal?\u00a0 I am informed that\u00a0 it used to be a common sight in the New York Zoological Gardens to see Mr. Crowley, the large and extremely intelligent chimpanzee, dressed in faultless attire, sit at the table and take his food and wine like a gentleman. Children believed him to be a man; and\u00a0 many intelligent grown\u00a0 people honestly believed that\u00a0 he was as much man as chimpanzee.\u00a0 But if the officials of the city of New York had been\u00a0 indicted for\u00a0 kidnaping, based upon\u00a0 the seizure and forcible detention of Mr.\u00a0 Crowley, would it\u00a0 not have been of the most solemn importance to them to throw away appearances and determine accurately what\u00a0 Mr. Crowley really was ?\u00a0 And in case of doubt as\u00a0 to what he was, could they not justly have demanded the benefit of that doubt?<\/p><p>So, where one who diverted an\u00a0 electric current\u00a0 has been accused by reason\u00a0 thereof of the crime of larceny, which crime, it being admitted, can be committed only against <em>tangible things,\u00a0 chattels,<\/em> is it not of the very greatest importance to determine what an electric current is, that is, whether it is a <em>tangible thing, a chattel<\/em>, or not and what is the nature and meaning of the process by which\u00a0 it transforms itself into electric light?\u00a0 And in case\u00a0 of\u00a0 doubt as to what it is, cannot the accused justly demand the benefit of that\u00a0 doubt?\u00a0 To convict one of larceny it is not\u00a0 sufficient to show merely that a\u00a0 wrongful\u00a0 act has been done; but it must appear that a\u00a0 wrongful\u00a0 act <em>of a particular kind<\/em> has\u00a0 been\u00a0 committed.\u00a0 To constitute\u00a0 larceny\u00a0 it\u00a0 must be proved\u00a0 that the wrongful act was committed against <em>chattels,<\/em> against tangible things, which were <em>seized upon and adported<\/em> by the one accused.\u00a0 In the case at bar it has not been\u00a0 shown that\u00a0 the\u00a0 accused laid unlawful hands\u00a0 upon and\u00a0 asported a\u00a0 tangible\u00a0 thing, a chattel, <em>una\u00a0 cosa mueble.<\/em> The\u00a0 very least that the prosecution must necessarily admit is that <em>no one knows what electricity really is.<\/em>\u00a0 That being so, it seems to\u00a0 me to be a contradiction of terms to say that larceny, which must admittedly be committed against a <em>known thing<\/em>, can be committed against a thing <em>absolutely unknown<\/em>.\u00a0 At least it would seem that there is a grave doubt about the definition of larceny covering wrongful acts relative to an\u00a0 electric current; and <em>by reason of\u00a0 that doubt<\/em> the conviction ought not to be\u00a0 sustained.\u00a0\u00a0 And if it is true, as I have herein\u00a0 attempted to show, that, under the\u00a0 prevailing and generally accepted\u00a0 theory, electricity is nothing more or less than\u00a0 a condition, a quality, a property of some tangible thing,\u00a0 some chattel or\u00a0 body, then, certainly, the charge of larceny\u00a0 must fall, as\u00a0 that crime can be committed only against the thing and not against a <em>quality<\/em> of the thing.<\/p><p>Although the only question\u00a0 in this case is whether electricity is such a tangible\u00a0 thing as can, under the definition of larceny contained in the Penal Code,\u00a0 be the subject of larceny, nevertheless the court dismisses that question substantially without discussion,\u00a0 the only\u00a0 reference thereto being the following:<\/p><p>\"It is true that electricity is no longer, as formerly, regarded by electricians\u00a0 as a fluid,\u00a0 but\u00a0 its manifestations and effects, like those\u00a0 of gas, may\u00a0 be seen and felt.\u00a0 The true test of what is a proper subject of larceny seems to be not whether the subject is\u00a0 corporeal or incorporeal, but whether it is capable of appropriation\u00a0 by another than the owner.<\/p><p align=\"center\"> *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<\/p><blockquote><p>\"Electricity,\u00a0 the same as gas, is\u00a0 a valuable article of merchandise, bought and sold\u00a0 like other personal property and is capable of appropriation\u00a0 by another.\u00a0\u00a0 So no error was committed by the\u00a0 trial court in holding that electricity is a subject of larceny.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>This statement\u00a0 fails to touch\u00a0 the\u00a0 essential\u00a0 question involved and is\u00a0 wholly\u00a0 beside\u00a0 the point for the following reasons, laying aside for the moment the nature of the act which\u00a0 the accused actually committed, assuming that he committed the act described by the witnesses for the prosecution:<\/p><p>In the first place, as I understand the law, the statement is not quite\u00a0 correct that, in the\u00a0 Philippine Islands, \"the true test of what is a proper subject of larceny seems to be not whether the subject is corporeal or incorporeal, but whether it is capable of<em> appropriation\"\u00a0 unless the\u00a0 word \"appropriation\" has the same meaning as the word \"taking\"<\/em> used in the article of the Penal Code defining1 larceny.\u00a0 If the court intended to use the word\u00a0 \"appropriation\" in the sense of \"taking,\" then its\u00a0 use was unnecessary and may be misleading.\u00a0\u00a0 If it did not so intend, then the rule of law laid down by the\u00a0 court is not as I understand the law to be. An <em>appropriation<\/em> in addition to or different from\u00a0 the <em>taking<\/em> is not an\u00a0 essential\u00a0 of larceny anywhere.\u00a0\u00a0 Wharton\u00a0 says that \"larceny is\u00a0 the fraudulent <em>taking<\/em> and <em>carrying away<\/em> of a thing without\u00a0 claim\u00a0 of right, with the <em>intention<\/em> of converting it to\u00a0 a\u00a0 use other than\u00a0 that of\u00a0 the owner and without his consent.\"\u00a0 Article 517\u00a0 of the Penal\u00a0 Code provides that they shall be guilty of\u00a0 larceny \"who\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 * take (toman)\u00a0 (not\u00a0 appropriate) another's\u00a0 <em>cosas muebles<\/em> (movable chattels)\u00a0 without the owner's consent.\"\u00a0 Unless, therefore, the\u00a0 word \"appropriation\" is used in\u00a0 the same sense as \"taking,\"\u00a0 the paragraph\u00a0 in the court's decision above quoted\u00a0 does not contain a correct statement of\u00a0 the law.\u00a0 If it means the same thing then the use of the word in no way enlightens the situation;\u00a0 for it is just as difficult to determine whether a cosa mueble can be appropriated as it is to\u00a0 determine whether\u00a0 it can be taken.\u00a0\u00a0 The question before us is whether or not electricity is such a cosa mueble that it can be taken under\u00a0 the law of larceny.\u00a0\u00a0 To\u00a0 substitute in that problem the word \"appropriation\" for the word \"taking\" does not aid in\u00a0 its solution in the slightest degree when it is admitted that the word substituted means exactly the same thing as the word in the place of which\u00a0 it was substituted.<\/p><p>An illustration will serve\u00a0 further to show the fallacy inherent in the statement quoted: Let us suppose that the Penal Code denned larceny thus: \"Any person who, with intent to gain, takes\u00a0 from another his cake without\u00a0 his consent\u00a0 shall be\u00a0 guilty of\u00a0 larceny.\"\u00a0 Let us\u00a0 suppose that some one should then define the subject of larceny as anything, corporeal or incorporeal, which can be \"appropriated,\" It would be obvious that such definition would be erroneous, for the reason that, while pie is as capable of being \"appropriated\" as cake, still, under the terms of the law, larceny cannot be committed against pie.\u00a0 So that where the statute prescribes that the only thing subject to larceny is a cosa mueble and the definition of the subject of larceny is claimed to be anything that can be\u00a0 \"appropriated,\" the answer at once is\u00a0 that such definition\u00a0 is inaccurate under the law as it may\u00a0 be\u00a0 too broad.\u00a0 There may be\u00a0 some things\u00a0 which can be \"appropriated\" that\u00a0 are not <em>cosas muebles<\/em>.<\/p><p>In the second place, the quoted paragraph from the court's decision contains another error in the statement of the law. I am of the opinion that, under the common law,\u00a0 and I am sure under the Spanish law, the statement that\u00a0 \"the true test of what is a proper subject of larceny seems to be not whether the subject is corporeal or incorporeal\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\" is not accurate.\u00a0\u00a0 Professor\u00a0 Beale, of Harvard, says in his article on larceny\u00a0 that - <\/p><blockquote><p>\"At common law the only subjects of larceny were <em>tangible, movable chattels; <\/em>something which could be taken in possession and carried away, and which had some, although trifling, intrinsic\u00a0 value.\u00a0 Any substance which has <em>length, breadth,<\/em> and\u00a0 <em>thickness<\/em> may be the subject\u00a0 of larceny. *\u00a0 *\u00a0 * A chose in\u00a0 action being in\u00a0 its essence intangible could not be the subject of larceny at common law, and the paper evidence of the chose in action was considered merged with it.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Wharton says;<\/p><blockquote><p>\"<em>Choses in action<\/em>, including bonds and notes of all classes, according to the common law, are not the subjects of larceny, being mere rights\u00a0 of action, having no corporeal existence; *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.\" <\/p><\/blockquote><p>I have already\u00a0 quoted\u00a0 at length from\u00a0 writers\u00a0 on the<\/p><p>Spanish and\u00a0 Roman law to show that only\u00a0 <em>tangible, corporeal <\/em>chattels can be the subject of larceny.<\/p><p>In the third place, by entirely begging\u00a0 the\u00a0 question, it leaves\u00a0 the\u00a0 whole\u00a0 proposition of whether\u00a0 electricity is\u00a0 a subject\u00a0 of larceny not only unsolved but wholly untouched. As we\u00a0 have\u00a0 already\u00a0 seen,\u00a0 the\u00a0 word\u00a0 \"appropriation\" nowhere appears in subdivision 1 of the Penal Code in connection with larceny.\u00a0 But if it were there used in connection with such crime, it would necessarily refer entirely to a <em>cosa mueble<\/em>\u00a0 as that is the only\u00a0 thing under that article which is the subject of larceny and, therefore, of \"appropriation.\" So\u00a0 that, before\u00a0 we can possibly know whether\u00a0 a thing is capable of appropriation or not under the\u00a0 Penal Code, we must know whether that thing is or is not a <em>cosa\u00a0 mueble<\/em>, as that, as we\u00a0 have said, is\u00a0 the only thing that can be taken or appropriated in committing the crime of larceny.\u00a0 But, as is readily seen, that brings us right back to the question we started with, What is a cosa mueble?\u00a0\u00a0 It is\u00a0 more than apparent, therefore, that the quoted paragraph adds nothing whatever to the discussion.<\/p><p>In the fourth place, the word \"appropriation\" in the paragraph quoted is there used with a complete misapprehension of its meaning as found in the article of the Civil.Code from which it is taken.\u00a0 Articles 334 and 335 of the Civil Code seek to divide\u00a0 all property capable of appropriation into classes.\u00a0\u00a0 They read:<\/p><p>\"Art. 334.

The word in Spanish seems to be broader than its legal use in English.<\/p><p>From the foregoing it is plain\u00a0 that property\u00a0 to be <em>personal property <\/em>must not only be susceptible of appropriation, which the court in the quoted paragraph claims is the only requirement,<em> but it must also be capable of being of itself manually\u00a0 seized and transported from one place to another.<\/em><br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>This presents the fourth reason why I say\u00a0 that the proposition laid down by the court in the quoted paragraph is laid down under a complete misapprehension of\u00a0 the definition of\u00a0 <em>una cosa mueble.<\/em><\/p><p>And finally, the word \"appropriate\" which the court has used is\u00a0 found in subdivsion 2 of article 517 of the\u00a0 Penal Code.\u00a0 It provides that those are guilty of larceny, \"who, finding a thing\u00a0 <em>{una cosa mueble)<\/em> lost and knowing its owner, <em>appropriate<\/em> it with intent to gain.\"\u00a0 The signification which the word here has is quite different from that of the word \"take\"\u00a0 (toman)\u00a0 used in the first subdivision, being considerably limited in its reach.\u00a0 As used here it is very like \"convert.\"\u00a0 There is no removal from the possession of the owner, as in the first paragraph.\u00a0 In the Penal Code the word \"taking\" means something<em> more<\/em> than \"appropriation.\"\u00a0 It means a removal from the possession of the owner a transportation\u00a0 or asportation of the thing from one\u00a0 place to another\u00a0 from the possession\u00a0 of the owner to the possession\u00a0 of the thief; while \"appropriation\" means, rather, the making use or the converting of the property after the taking is complete, or without any \"taking\" at all. Under the Spanish law, while real estate is not, of course, subject to asportation, to \"taking,\" and, therefore,\u00a0 not the subject of larceny, it <em>is<\/em> subject to \"appropriation,\"\u00a0\u00a0 In the same way while electricity is, under the Spanish and Roman laws, wholly incapable of seizure and\u00a0 asportation, of the manual \"taking,\" the <em>trespass <\/em>essential to larceny, it <em>may<\/em> possibly, in one or another sense of the word, be subject to appropriation.\"\u00a0 If at one extreme of the scale of things, namely, real estate, the thing is <em>too<\/em> tangible to be stolen, is it not\u00a0 logical to\u00a0 expect that\u00a0 at the opposite extreme the thing, electricity, for example, may be\u00a0 found too <em>in<\/em>tangible to be stolen?<\/p><p>We\u00a0 have seen that,\u00a0 in all the history of Roman and Spanish jurisprudence,\u00a0 the crime of larceny has been confined to\u00a0 <em>tangible things, to chattels<\/em>, which have an\u00a0 independent existence of\u00a0 their own;\u00a0 which have three dimensions; which occupy space; which are\u00a0 capable of having a trespass\u00a0 committed against themselves; which can be,<em> of themselves and alone,<\/em> taken physically into\u00a0 possession and. carried away (asported).<\/p><p>We have seen that the fact that <em>electricity is not such a thing is admitted by all.<\/em><\/p><p>And we\u00a0 have asked the\u00a0 question, \"How,\u00a0 then, can the charge of larceny be sustained?\"<\/p><p>But let us assume,\u00a0 for the sake of argument, that electricity is a tangible thing, like water, for instance.\u00a0 Still the crime committed, if any, is not larceny.\u00a0 Let us modify the illustration already given of the surreptitious removal by A of water stored\u00a0 in a dam by B for milling purposes. Let us suppose that B has built a reservoir on an elevated portion of his farm for the storage of water for irrigating purposes.\u00a0 He has built ditches or conduits from the reservoir to every part of his farm to carry the water to the places needed.\u00a0\u00a0 During the dry season while\u00a0 B is\u00a0 engaged in\u00a0 irrigating\u00a0 his\u00a0 lands A surreptitiously\u00a0 and with intent to\u00a0 gain,\u00a0 constructs a\u00a0 small mill upon one\u00a0 of the\u00a0 conduits and utilizes the rapid fall and\u00a0 swift flow of the water to operate his mill.\u00a0 For many months A thus\u00a0 takes advantage of B's conduit and water and enriches himself by reason thereof.\u00a0 Did A commit the crime of larceny?\u00a0 The water, every drop of it, after\u00a0 being used by A, went to its work of irrigating the lands of B, pausing only long enough to turn the water\u00a0 wheel\u00a0 of A's mill.\u00a0 Certainly then, no<em> water<\/em> was stolen.\u00a0\u00a0 A\u00a0 simply made use of the \"head,\" the fall of the water.\u00a0 If anything was stolen it was the <em>\"head<\/em>,\" the elevation of the water, the <em>energy<\/em> developed by its passage from high to low\u00a0 ground.\u00a0 This is precisely what\u00a0 happens when an electric\u00a0 current passes through\u00a0 an\u00a0 electric\u00a0 bulb or\u00a0 arc and produces light.\u00a0 Whether the current operates one light or one\u00a0 hundred,\u00a0 the\u00a0 <em>volume,<\/em> the amperage,\u00a0 of the current, that\u00a0 is, the <em>quantity<\/em> of it, if we may use the term (and it must be remembered that I am assuming electricity to be a tangible thing and will\u00a0 speak\u00a0 accordingly) remains exactly the same.\u00a0\u00a0 The <em>volume<\/em> or<em> quantity of the electricity is just\u00a0 the same when it comes out of\u00a0 the hundredth light as it was when it\u00a0 entered the\u00a0 first.<\/em>\u00a0 While there is a difference between the current as it comes from the last light and as it entered the first, it is simply one of <em>condition, or state.<\/em>\u00a0\u00a0 All of the <em>electricity<\/em> is still there. Like the water; it has simply lost its \"head,\" its\u00a0 energy. It has\u00a0 been deprived of its <em>pressure<\/em>, of its <em>electro-motive force;<\/em> but\u00a0 it is the same old electricity, in the same old quantity.\u00a0 So that, when the accused in the case at bar, by means\u00a0 of a \"jumper,\" burned thirty lights, instead of the three for which he paid the company,\u00a0 he Was not stealing electricity.\u00a0 Exactly as much electricity went back into the company's wire after serving the twenty-seven lights for which he did not pay as came out of that wire in the first place.\u00a0 The defendant <em>took<\/em> nothing;\u00a0 he<em> used<\/em> something.

Umberto\u00a0 Pipia, in his very able work entitled \"U Elettricita nel Diritto\" puts the\u00a0 question thus (translation\u00a0 of Mr.\u00a0 Percy\u00a0 R.\u00a0 Angell, Manila, 1911) :\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"From the point of view of the jurist can\u00a0 electricity\u00a0 be stolen?\u00a0 A person connects a\u00a0 deflecting\u00a0 wire to the main conduit of electricity; he thus makes\u00a0 a\u00a0 secondary circuit in which he\u00a0 introduces a\u00a0 resistence\u00a0 and profits\u00a0 by\u00a0 the electro-motive power which is developed, to supply his lamps or put his motor in movement.\u00a0 In such case\u00a0 can we apply article\u00a0 402 of the Penal\u00a0 Code, which\u00a0 provides that whoever\u00a0 takes possession\u00a0 of\u00a0 movable\u00a0 property of\u00a0 another\u00a0 in order to derive\u00a0 profit thereby,\u00a0 taking it from the place where he finds it without\u00a0 the consent\u00a0 of the owner,\u00a0 is punished with <em>reclusion<\/em> up to three years?\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The author then refers to the decisions of certain courts of Europe which hold\u00a0 that electricity is stealable,\u00a0 and continues :<\/p><p>\"The Roman\u00a0 court\u00a0 of cassation has lost sight\u00a0 of that fundamental principle\u00a0 of interpretation\u00a0 of law (a principle which it ought to have had well in mind before applying to new manifestations of force legislative provisions enacted in view\u00a0 of totally different\u00a0 cases) by which penal laws do not extend <em>beyond the cases and the times in them expressed.<\/em><em>Nulla poena sine lege,<\/em> is the rule in terms of penal law, unless we wish to bring about a deplorable confusion of powers, and the judiciary desires to i\u00a0 If in\u00a0 the written\u00a0 laws gaps or\u00a0 breaks are encountered, it is the duty of the court to point them out to the legislator, to the\u00a0 end that he take the necessary measures; but it is not lawful for him by analogous interpretation to apply a penal\u00a0 provision where such has\u00a0 not been explicitly enacted.<\/p><p>''In the unanimous opinion of\u00a0 jurists, two\u00a0 elements\u00a0 are necessary to constitute the crime of theft, legally speaking; the first is the taking possession of the personal (movable) property of\u00a0 another, <em>contrectatio<\/em>, and the taking away of the thing from the place where it is found without the consent of the person to whom it belongs, <em>ablatio<\/em>.<\/p><p>\"Now we\u00a0 have conclusively shown that electric current is not a thing, but a state, a\u00a0 vibration following\u00a0 certain converging\" waves.\u00a0 It can not therefore\u00a0 be taken\u00a0 possession of as the personal property of another.\u00a0 A person who unlawfully\u00a0 uses electric\u00a0 current for his personal\u00a0 enjoyment places\u00a0 himself in a\u00a0 state of unlawful enjoyment of a utility, but he does not take possession of personal property. It was a grave error, that of the court of cassation, in holding electric current to be a thing imprisoned in wires, and composed of particles that can be substracted.\u00a0\u00a0 In connecting a second circuit one does not substract electric current; <em> not\u00a0 a particle of electric\u00a0 energy enters into the possession of the so-called thief; <\/em>the same amount in amperes that was found and derived on connecting the second circuit, is found at the end of this circuit.\u00a0\u00a0 The <em>current\u00a0 has only suffered a\u00a0 diminution of potential;<\/em> while continuing to be of the same volume, it becomes less adapted\u00a0 for the use intended, because, having overcome a resistence, it has lost in potential, its electro-motive power.<\/p><p>\"*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 It <em>leaves the circuit in the same amount in which it \u00a0 entered.<\/em>\u00a0 Only its power for work has diminished. <em>Not a single particle or molecule of electric current is taken by such abusive use,<\/em> only the\u00a0 state of undulation.\u00a0 The movement that first follows the principal,\u00a0 and then\u00a0 the second circuit, and by these undulations the\u00a0 so-called thief illegally derives benefit.\u00a0\u00a0 But the extraordinary provisions of crime are not applicable to all illegal actions.<\/p><p>\"Another powerful argument\u00a0 in favor of my position is this: That in\u00a0 no case of usurpation, the\u00a0 using of\u00a0 things protected by law (<em>diritto<\/em>) that are not\u00a0 material things, do we speak of theft.\u00a0 To repress abuses the legislator has been obliged to establish special provisions of\u00a0 law, but has explicitly recognized those relating to theft to\u00a0 be inapplicable.\u00a0\u00a0 A trade-mark, trade-name, <em> modello de fabrica<\/em>,\u00a0 a scientific or artistic work, undoubtedly constitute objects\u00a0 of law similar to things; form the contents of various juridical relations; have a\u00a0 more or less\u00a0 economic value;\u00a0 pertain to the patrimony of the person who has produced them or brought them into being.\u00a0 If a third person makes use of the trade-mark or trade-name, the scientific work or artistic production of another, nobody denies that he takes possession of a\u00a0 utility that does not belong to him; that by the very illegal\u00a0 act he derives profit,\u00a0 and at the same time diminishes the patrimony of the person having legitimate rights herein.\u00a0 But with all that, it has never occurred to anyone to bring an action for theft against\u00a0 the\u00a0 usurper of\u00a0 the firm name,\u00a0 the counterfeiter\u00a0 of the trade-mark or\u00a0 the plagiarist.\u00a0 The legislator, desiring to protect this new species of property, has\u00a0 provided special\u00a0 repressive measures; but in their\u00a0 absence, the courts can not\u00a0 apply the <em>actio furti,<\/em> because it is not applicable to cases and conditions other than those provided for.<\/p><p>\"If this be so, why different conceptions on the score of electricity?\u00a0\u00a0 Here likewise, there is no substraction of personal property, but the illegal use of an advantage,\u00a0 of\u00a0 the right pertaining to\u00a0 another, <em>which remain\u00a0 however\u00a0 unchanged.<\/em>\u00a0 Hence the legal solution should be the same.<\/p><p>\"The second and not less essential\u00a0 condition of theft is that of the <em>ablatio<\/em>, the necessity of taking the thing from the place where it is found.\u00a0 But here we have nothing of that; the current is\u00a0 deviated from its course, true, but it returns to the place where it was undiminished.\u00a0 The statement in\u00a0 the\u00a0 foregoing decision\u00a0 that there are\u00a0 particles transportable from place to place is inexact; the undulation is in itself,\u00a0 it has its own\u00a0 efficiency, but it is neither taken away nor substracted.\u00a0 It has been justly said that all that is done is to erect a\u00a0 bridge over which the undulations of the\u00a0 particles\u00a0 are transported\u00a0 in\u00a0 the wire\u00a0 attached,\u00a0 but nothing corporeal passes from\u00a0 one wire to another, since not one of the vibrating particles moves\u00a0 with the current which flows through\u00a0 the connected wire.<\/p><p>\"Consequently,\u00a0 in\u00a0 whatever aspect the question is\u00a0 considered the presumption of theft grows less.\u00a0 In fine, although there be a usurpation of a\u00a0 utility to the prejudice of another, it should not be held to constitute theft, because that is the vulgar, not the legal conception.\u00a0 That in\u00a0 civil and commercial law we may resort to\u00a0 analogous interpretation, and that, in the absence of special provisions we should apply the\u00a0 rules which govern similar matters and analogous cases, there is no doubt.\u00a0 The courts can not refuse to say what the\u00a0 law is (<em>dire ie diritto<\/em>)\u00a0 nor dismiss the litigants on the pretext that the law had made no provision for their case; and it is from this concept that electricity, as\u00a0 a rule, in the various\u00a0 relations where it\u00a0 constitutes the\u00a0 object, is considered to be a thing,\u00a0 with all\u00a0 the attributes\u00a0 of such. But\u00a0 the penal\u00a0 law is restrictive; under certain aspects it is\u00a0 exceptional.\u00a0 Here\u00a0 we have to do\u00a0 with limitations and restrictions\u00a0 on the most sacred rights\u00a0 of persons, the right to liberty, the right to honor. And these rights can\u00a0 not be abridged without definite and explicit provisions of the\u00a0 law.

Experts\u00a0 say\u00a0 that\u00a0 the science is\u00a0 not yet\u00a0 determined.\u00a0 We well know\u00a0 what must\u00a0 be done\u00a0 to produce electric energy, but we do not comprehend these vital operations, any more than we\u00a0 understand what\u00a0 it\u00a0 is that makes the muscles of the human arm capable of\u00a0 exerting force.\u00a0 In the\u00a0 conclusions of the Court of First Instance there is no error of law.\u00a0 That court starts from\u00a0 the principle that the corporal existence of the thing must be the essential element to come within the meaning of article 242.\u00a0 This assumption is not based\u00a0 upon the precepts of\u00a0 the Civil Code,\u00a0 but,\u00a0 rather, upon\u00a0 the\u00a0 idea which\u00a0 is at the bottom of\u00a0 the\u00a0 Penal Code, namely, the movable and independent thing, which presupposes the corporeality of the object.\u00a0 If then, under articles 242 and 245, the condition precedent to the commission of larceny is that the object of theft or unlawful appropriation be a piece or portion of material substance in either a solid or liquid state, or in form of gas, the Court of First Instance committed no error in finding there was neither theft\u00a0 nor illegal appropriation.\u00a0 Whether or not the notion of a thing, in the sense of the penal laws, requires something corporeal, is\u00a0 a question of law; but the question whether electricity is\u00a0 a substance, a corporeal thing, or\u00a0 a force, a movement of minute particles, is a question of\u00a0 fact\u00a0 that can\u00a0 not be decided by the rules of law, but by physical research alone. The consideration of the great importance of electricity in commercial life and the place awaiting it among the vital conveniences and the\u00a0 fact of its having commercial value, is not an argument to prove\u00a0 that electricity is\u00a0 a corporeal thing, because the quality of being a vital convenience and having commercial value\u00a0 does not\u00a0 constitute a necessary standard of corporeality, since force, operations, intellectual products are vital conveniences (beni)\u00a0 and have commercial value.\u00a0\u00a0 When, in the jurisprudence of the day the need\u00a0 for penal laws for the punishment of unjust appropriation of electric current\u00a0 becomes\u00a0 apparent,\u00a0 the legislator\u00a0 should provide them.\u00a0 The courts can not be called upon to supply the lack of legal provisions by\u00a0 analogous\u00a0 applications pf rules not made to fit\u00a0 the circumstance.\u00a0 In penal law\u00a0 the principle <em>nulla poena sine lege<\/em> is supreme.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>These authorities fully support my\u00a0 contention that electricity is not stealable under the provisions of the\u00a0 Spanish Penal Code.\u00a0 They also support the proposition that even if electricity is a tangible thing, like water, and therefore stealable, the crime, if any, committed by the defendant in this case is not larceny,<em> became the company had just as much electricity after the illegal act as it had before. <\/em>\u00a0 In\u00a0 other words,<em> it has lost no electricity.<\/em>\u00a0 Having lost no electricity it can not charge anyone with stealing it.\u00a0 If a thousand lights were burned, no more <em>electricity<\/em> would be consumed than\u00a0 if one light were\u00a0 burned, just as, no more\u00a0 water is consumed in running a thousand\u00a0 water wheels placed one below another than\u00a0 in running one.\u00a0 Just as much water flows over the\u00a0 thousandth wheel\u00a0 as flowed over the first. In the same manner there is just as much electricity flowing out of\u00a0 the thousandth light\u00a0 as flowed into\u00a0 the\u00a0 first. Just\u00a0 as, in\u00a0 using the water, nothing is\u00a0 consumed but the <em>head<\/em>, the quantity of water remaining the same, so,\u00a0 in using electricity,\u00a0 nothing is consumed\u00a0 but the\u00a0 head (the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">pressure,<\/span> the <em>potential<\/em>,\u00a0 the electro-motive force),\u00a0 <em>the electricity itself remaining undiminished.<\/em>\u00a0\u00a0 No electricity was taken.\u00a0 It was used and then returned to its owner.<\/p><p>For a clear understanding of this problem, and\u00a0 a logical and philosophical, as well as legal, solution thereof,\u00a0 we must never, for a moment, forget the fact that the real\u00a0 contract between the company and the defendant was one to furnish <em>labor and services; a lease<\/em>, if you please,\u00a0 of <em>an agency<\/em>, a contract of\u00a0 precisely the same nature as one by which the company lets to the defendant the use of one of the\u00a0 company's workmen to turn by\u00a0 hand, in the defendant's own house, an\u00a0 electrical machine\u00a0 and thereby produce light for defendant's\u00a0 use.\u00a0 This is the crux of\u00a0 the\u00a0 whole question. While no contract was proved we know of necessity,\u00a0 from the principles which underlie and govern electric\u00a0 lighting, that the contract\u00a0 must have\u00a0 been\u00a0 as above stated.\u00a0 If the defendant should require the\u00a0 laborer thus placed in his house to work overtime and should not pay the company therefor, thus taking advantage of the situation, there would be no larceny.\u00a0 To be sure, the defendant would return the workman to the company fatigued and reduced in strength by reason of the\u00a0 overtime he had required him\u00a0 to put\u00a0 in, <em>but it would be the same workman which he had received.<\/em> It is this which shows the absurdity of the claim\u00a0 that the defendant in this\u00a0 case is guilty of larceny.\u00a0 The company never intended to <em>sell the workman<\/em> to the defendant and the defendant never expected to buy him.\u00a0\u00a0 It was the <em>use<\/em> that\u00a0 was the basis of the contract.\u00a0 In exactly the\u00a0 same manner, the company never intended to <em>sell electricity<\/em> to the defendant and the defendant never intended to buy electricity.\u00a0 The basis of the contract was the use of electricity. Just\u00a0 as the laborer was returned by defendant to the company fatigued\u00a0 and reduced in strength by reason of the overtime which the defendant had wrongfully and illegally required him to\u00a0 put\u00a0 in, so the current of electricity was returned by\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant to the\u00a0 company fatigued and reduced\u00a0 in strength by reason of the lights which the defendant\u00a0 had\u00a0 wrongfully and illegally caused it to supply; and just as,\u00a0 notwithstanding\u00a0 the reduction in\u00a0 strength,\u00a0 it was the same\u00a0 identical workman returned that was sent out,<em> so the electric current returned to the company\u00a0 after the illegal use by defendant was the same identical current which the company had furnished him.<\/em>\u00a0\u00a0 Where then, is the foundation for the charge of larceny?<\/p><p>Let us now see what are the results of the holding of the court that electricity is subject to larceny.<\/p><p>The Spanish Law of the Philippine Islands has not been changed\u00a0 by any legislative enactment.\u00a0 A <em>cosa mueble<\/em> is the\u00a0 same now as it was in the days of the <em>Partidas.<\/em>\u00a0 No legislature has changed the\u00a0 law\u00a0 of larceny as. it\u00a0 came\u00a0 from the jurisprudence of Rome and Spain.\u00a0\u00a0 Nor has any legislature touched the law of the\u00a0 personal chattel to give it\u00a0 a new definition or one which changes its ancient signification. Its present definition is the same as that given\u00a0 by Sanchez Roman, Pacheco, Scaevola, Manresa, and Groizard as drawn from\u00a0 the decrees of kings and acts\u00a0 of\u00a0 legislatures.\u00a0\u00a0 That definition having\u00a0 been framed by the <em>lawmaking<\/em> power of Spain, from the idown to the Penal Code, it ought not to be changed by any agency short of the\u00a0 lawmaking power of the\u00a0 United States.\u00a0 The substance and nature of crime ought not to be changed by courts\u00a0 in a country where crimes are purely <em>statutory<\/em>.\u00a0\u00a0 It has the appearance\u00a0 of\u00a0 a usurpation\u00a0 of the functions of the lawmaking\u00a0 body,\u00a0 an unwarrantable assumption\u00a0 of legislative attributes.<\/p><p>The holding of the court\u00a0 in this case is, in effect,\u00a0 an amendment to the Penal Code.\u00a0 It has changed materially the definition of a i and,\u00a0 therefore, of the crime of larceny, as made\u00a0 by the\u00a0 lawmaking bodies of Spain and the United\u00a0 States.\u00a0 I do not\u00a0 assert that the\u00a0 courts\u00a0 have not the right to determine whether\u00a0 a given set of facts do or do not fulfill the\u00a0 definition of a given crime.\u00a0\u00a0 What I do say is that the\u00a0 very greatest care should be exercised in cases which may involve as a consequence of their decision the changing of the\u00a0 scope of the substantive law\u00a0 of crime. The fact, admitted\u00a0 by all,\u00a0 that whether\u00a0 the phenomenon which we call electricity really is a \"<em>cosa mueble<\/em>,\" under the accepted\u00a0 definition of that word,<em> is open to doubt<\/em>, should give us\u00a0 pause.\u00a0 Before\u00a0 holding\u00a0 that electricity is\u00a0 a\u00a0 i, the fact whether it is or not ought to be substantially\u00a0 free from\u00a0 doubt.\u00a0 This is\u00a0 particularly true\u00a0 in a country\u00a0 where crimes are purely statutory, and in\u00a0 which, therefore, the legislature\u00a0 is\u00a0 presumed to have had in mind in framing its definition of \"<em>cosas muebles<\/em>\" only such chattels, or those of the <em>same nature<\/em>, as were known to the legislature at the time\u00a0 it acted.\u00a0\u00a0 At the time the Penal Code became operative substantially nothing was known by those who created\u00a0 it of the phenomenon, electricity.\u00a0\u00a0 It is more than clear that at the time of the enactment\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 laws relating to larceny, of which article\u00a0 517 of the Penal Code is a reproduction, nothing\u00a0 whatever was known of\u00a0 that phenomenon.\u00a0 We have, therefore, no\u00a0 means\u00a0 of\u00a0 knowing what\u00a0 would\u00a0 have been\u00a0 the legislative action\u00a0 in relation thereto.\u00a0\u00a0 The legislative authorities of those times might have treated\u00a0 it as substantially every other legislative body has treated it that has touched the question; namely,\u00a0 as a thing separate and distinct from chattels, and unlawful acts affecting it and its use as crimes distinct\u00a0 from the crimes against tangible property, such as robbery and larceny.\u00a0 In this jurisdiction the legislature is the only authority for the definition of crime.\u00a0 Where a new situation arises by virtue of discoveries which reveal agencies never known before, and whose real\u00a0 nature is unknown even to the discoverers, the legislature is\u00a0 the body to take the initiative in determining the position of such agencies among the affairs of men, unless they <em>clearly<\/em> fall within a class already established and defined; and it appears that some legislative bodies have done that very thing and have passed special\u00a0 laws touching the place which should be given electricity in the civil and criminal law.\u00a0\u00a0 This was done here by the passage of the ordinance of\u00a0 the city of Manila.\u00a0 The fact that legislatures in many jurisdictions\u00a0 have enacted special laws\u00a0 relative to electricity is\u00a0 the\u00a0 very\u00a0 clearest proof that there was the gravest doubt among learned men\u00a0 of the applicability of existing laws\u00a0 to acts committed against the rights of producers of electricity.\u00a0 The legislature of the Islands having acted through the council of the city of Manila and by such action made illegal acts against the producers of electricity a special crime <em>wholly distinct from larceny, <\/em>such act should be conclusive on this court as to the legislative\u00a0 intent.<\/p><p>Section 649 of\u00a0 the Revised Ordinances of the city of Manila provides in part:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"No person\u00a0 shall, for\u00a0 any purpose whatsoever,\u00a0 use\u00a0 or enjoy the\u00a0 benefits of any device by means of which he may fraudulently obtain any current of\u00a0 electricity or any telephone or telegraph service; and the existence in any building or premises of any\u00a0 such device shall, in the absence of satisfactory explanation,\u00a0 be deemed sufficient evidence of such use by the persons benefiting thereby.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>This section was enacted under the authority\u00a0 of the Legislature of the Philippine Islands, as was section 930 of said ordinances,\u00a0 by the terms\u00a0 of which one\u00a0 who violates the provisions of\u00a0 section 649 \"shall be punished by a fine\u00a0 of not more\u00a0 than two hundred pesos or by\u00a0 imprisonment for not more than\u00a0 six months, or by both such fine and imprisonment, in the discretion of the court, for each offense.\"<\/p><blockquote><p>Articles 517 and 518 of the Penal Code read in part as follows:<\/p><p>\"Art. 517.

Charles S. Lobingier presiding, denying\u00a0 relief\u00a0 to\u00a0 both parties, and\u00a0 have each presented separate bills of exceptions, with their\u00a0 corresponding assignments of error.\u00a0 Tha$ judgment (omitting the findings of fact and the discussion of the law)\u00a0 is as follows:\u00a0 <blockquote><p>\"The\u00a0 court finds that plaintiff is not entitled\u00a0 to recover in this action and that defendants are not entitled\u00a0 to recover on their counterclaim,\u00a0 but\u00a0 this finding is\u00a0 without prejudice to a future action on the contract in question.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"It is, therefore, considered and adjudged that the plaintiff take nothing by his complaint and the defendants nothing by\u00a0 their counterclaim, but\u00a0 that they recover their costs.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>On the 30th day of October, 1904, by a public\u00a0 instrument, executed by the plaintiff and defendants, the latter leased from the former for a term of five years, to begin on November 15, 1904, at a monthly\u00a0 rental of P600, payable\u00a0 semiannually, a building in the city of Manila.\u00a0\u00a0 The building at the time of the execution\u00a0 of the lease was in process of construction and was to be completed at the time fixed for the\u00a0 beginning of the term.\u00a0 The building was to consist of three floors, the\u00a0 first to be used by the defendants for the storage and sale of meats and provisions,\u00a0 and the second and\u00a0 third to be\u00a0 divided into rooms suitable for offices or living rooms.\u00a0 In January,\u00a0 1907, by agreement of the parties, the rental was reduced from P600 to P500 a\u00a0 month.\u00a0 The defendants occupied the building from\u00a0 November 15,\u00a0 1904, up to and including\u00a0 February 15,\u00a0 1908, and paid the rents in accordance with the contract.\u00a0\u00a0 Under the original lease, no provision was made for the making of necessary\u00a0 repairs by the landlord, but on\u00a0 the 16th of May, 1905,\u00a0 a modification\u00a0 of the lease\u00a0 was\u00a0 executed in writing whereby the rent was to be paid monthly and\u00a0 the landlord\u00a0 undertook to make all necessary repairs not\u00a0 due to the fault of the tenants.<\/p><p>The complaint sets up the\u00a0 original lease\u00a0 executed by the parties, and alleges that the defendants,\u00a0 on the 15th of February, 1908, vacated the leased property\u00a0 and refused to continue the performance of their contract; that defendants have failed to pay the rent for the month of February, 1908; that plaintiff has been damaged by the vacation of the property by the defendants in the sum of P12,600, consisting of the rent which under the lease would\u00a0 have accrued to the plaintiff, less whatever plaintiff might receive from the building in case he should be able to rent it to others; and that defendants, on demand,\u00a0 have failed and refused to perform their obligation under\u00a0 the lease and to pay the\u00a0 rent due.\u00a0\u00a0 The prayer is for the recovery of P12,600, as damages for the breach of the contract, with interest and costs.<\/p><p>The defendants demurred to the complaint on the ground that the same stated no cause of action, and to the overruling of this\u00a0 demurrer they duly excepted.\u00a0 Thereafter defendants answered, setting up as a special defense that plaintiff had consented to the termination of the lease, and that plaintiff had himself violated the contract by failure to make the necessary repairs, and setting up by way of counterclaim, the damages caused them by plaintiff's breach of the contract.<\/p><p>Whether this\u00a0 case be treated as an action for\u00a0 damages for breach of contract or one to recover rents, the result will be the same. If,\u00a0 as contended by the defendants, the breach of this contract of lease was committed by\u00a0 the plaintiff, then he is entitled to no recovery whatever from the time defendants vacated the building and rescinded said contract\u00a0 The trial court made no findings of fact on this point.<\/p><p>There is\u00a0 no\u00a0 doubt that the plaintiff\u00a0 was under contractual obligation to make the necessary repairs upon the building not due to the fault\u00a0 of the defendants.\u00a0\u00a0 The following supplemental contract, executed May 16,1905, clearly establishes this fact:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"This is to certify that the owner of the above-mentioned property and the lessors thereof have agreed that payments after\u00a0 November\u00a0 16, of this year shall be made monthly in advance.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"The parties concerned have also agreed that the repairs it needs, which are\u00a0 not\u00a0 made necessary through fault of the tenants, shall be made\u00a0 at the expense of the owner of the property and paid for by him.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"In witness whereof, we affix our names.<\/p><\/blockquote><p align=\"right\"> \"MANL.

It had been built of\u00a0 green\u00a0 lumber and the\u00a0 shrinkage\u00a0 of the\u00a0 material opened seams so that\u00a0 in every storm the\u00a0 rain entered\u00a0 the rooms, rendering practically all of them unfit for\u00a0 occupancy.\u00a0 At this\u00a0 time nearly every\u00a0 room in the building was occupied by the tenants\u00a0 of\u00a0 the defendants, but\u00a0 said tenants were forced to move out on account of the\u00a0 discomfort and damage due to the entrance of the\u00a0 rain and\u00a0 the\u00a0 lack of privacy occasioned by the opening of the inner partitions and the warping of the doors so that they could not be closed.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding the numerous demands made upon the plaintiff\u00a0 by the defendants\u00a0 to comply with the provisions of the supplemental\u00a0 contract by\u00a0 repairing\u00a0 the\u00a0 building, he refused to do so.\u00a0\u00a0 The record clearly and conclusively establishes the breach of\u00a0 the contract on the part of the plaintiff.<\/p><p>With reference to the defendants' counterclaim, the trial court found that the evidence was\u00a0 not sufficiently definite to justify a judgment in their favor.\u00a0 We can not say that this\u00a0 finding of fact is openly and\u00a0 manifestly against\u00a0 the weight of the evidence.<\/p><p>The judgment appealed from in so far as it authorizes either of the parties to bring another action upon the same contract\u00a0 is reversed;\u00a0 in all other\u00a0 respects it is affirmed, without cost.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<\/p><p><em>Johnson, Carson<\/em>, and <em>Moreland, JJ.<\/em>, concur.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 <br\/><\/p><hr align=\"left\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><p>\u00a0<\/p><p align=\"center\"><em>DISSENTING<\/em><\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p><strong>TORRES, <em>J.,<\/em><\/strong><\/p><p>With due respect for the opinion of the majority, the undersigned, in compliance with the duty his position imposes, believes that the contract of lease, violation whereof is the basis of the complaint entered by\u00a0 the plaintiff, Manuel Donato, is an established fact, unmooted by the\u00a0 parties,\u00a0 and that in the absence of plain\u00a0 proof that the defendants had a just reason for leaving the leased house before the expiration of the time stipulated, thereby breaking the agreement, the terms binding the contracting parties should be observed, with damages to the owner of the property.<\/p><p>If the property became uninhabitable through the fault of the owner, the plaintiff, because he did not make the repairs requested by the tenants, this\u00a0 fact should be investigated and duly proved.\u00a0 The defectiveness and bad condition of said house and the repairs made on it are not fully established, with a detailed statement in such terms that the abandonment of the property by the\u00a0 tenants, who remained in it for more than three years, can\u00a0 be held to be justified.<\/p><p>The reasons inducing the abandonment of the house which the tenants occupied, and which they used for their business for three\u00a0 years should be fully proved in this suit, so that it may appear that the contract recognized and\u00a0 admitted by both parties\u00a0 was not violated.<\/p><p>The judgment of\u00a0 the\u00a0 lower\u00a0 court dismissing the cross-complaint of the defendants, which has been affirmed by the majority,\u00a0 demonstrates the\u00a0 groundlessness of this counter-claim, which was doubtless made for the purpose of offsetting the complaint of the owner of the property, as well as the baselessness of their allegations.\u00a0 Amid the incompleteness of the evidence adduced in the attempt to justify the violation of\u00a0 the contract by the lessor, the existence\u00a0 of the contract itself, the source of the mutual rights and obligations of the lessor and the lessees, stands out as the only plain and undeniable fact.<\/p><p>It does not, therefore, appear to be\u00a0 made dear and demonstrated in the suit that the property was rendered uninhabitable by the lessor's failure to make the necessary and timely repairs, and that thus the terms of the contract were violated in such manner that the lessees had to leave the\u00a0 property through fault of the owner.<\/p><p>It accordingly appears proper to the undersigned that the judgment appealed from should be annulled and the case remanded to the lower court for a new hearing to make plain the facts alleged by the lessees.\u00a0 Evidence should be taken to determine wherein the property was defective and incomplete, from what parts of the house the leakages came when it rained, showing the rooms and floors into which they made their way, whether there were leaks in the roof of the house, how long since the same were noticed, and what kinds of repairs the\u00a0 lessor made at the request of the tenants.

These\u00a0 undershirts are\u00a0 of the\u00a0 ordinary class and their making up in the style for which no surtax can be levied.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The Insular Collector of Customs rendered the same decision upon each of said protests, as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"This\u00a0 protest is against the assessment\u00a0 of a\u00a0 surtax\u00a0 of 30 per centum for the application of trimmings on certain knitted cotton undershirts, dutiable\u00a0 under\u00a0 paragraph 125 <i>(b<\/i>) of the Tariff\u00a0 Revision Law of 1901 at $0.35 per kilo, not less than 25 per\u00a0 centum <i>ad valorem<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>\"The Court of Customs\u00a0 Appeals held <i>in re<\/i> Docket No. 725 (Appeal No.\u00a0 663)\u00a0 that similar undershirts were\u00a0 liable to the surtax provided for the application\u00a0 of trimmings (see Tariff Decision\u00a0 Circular\u00a0 No. 452).\u00a0 This\u00a0 question was further amplified\u00a0 in Docket No. 795, unpublished,\u00a0 in case of Messrs.\u00a0 Kuenzle &amp; Streiff, dated June\u00a0 21,\u00a0 1905, where\u00a0 the\u00a0 Court of Customs Appeals\u00a0 reaffirmed the application of the surtax in question.\"<\/blockquote>The\u00a0 Insular Collector of Customs overruled each of the protests.\u00a0 An appeal from such decision was taken in each case to the\u00a0 Court of First Instance of Manila.\u00a0\u00a0 On October 25,\u00a0 1907, that court rendered a decision in\u00a0 the Froehlich &amp; Kuttner\u00a0 case, affirming the decision of the Insular Collector of Customs.\u00a0 It\u00a0 does not appear that a decision was rendered on the appeal of Messrs. Kuenzle &amp; Streiff.\u00a0 Thereafter,\u00a0 on the 1st day of October, 1908, the Supreme\u00a0 Court of the Philippine Islands rendered a decision upon the\u00a0 same question\u00a0 in another case of Froehlich &amp; Kuttner <i>vs<\/i>. Collector\u00a0 of Customs, <sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> reversing the\u00a0 decision of the Insular Collector of Customs and the\u00a0 judgment of\u00a0 the\u00a0 Court of First Instance.\u00a0 In that\u00a0 case this court held that knitted undershirts with a knitted particolored border sewed around the collar and down the front are not subject to the surtax prescribed\u00a0 by group 3,\u00a0 Rule B,\u00a0 of the Tariff\u00a0 Revision Law of 1905 and that such a border does not constitute an application\u00a0 of trimmings under rule 7.\u00a0\u00a0 A motion for\u00a0 a rehearing was filed and on October 29, 1908, after careful consideration, a decision was rendered denying the motion. Thereafter and on the\u00a0 5th of December, 1908, a new\u00a0 trial was granted by the Court of First Instance in the\u00a0 other two cases, as well as in a number of similar cases pending in that court.\u00a0 Upon the retrials, the trial court, following the decision of this\u00a0 court,\u00a0 reversed in\u00a0 each instance the judgment of\u00a0 the\u00a0 Insular Collector of\u00a0 Customs.\u00a0\u00a0 It\u00a0 was stipulated on the trial of said\u00a0 causes\u00a0 that\u00a0 the\u00a0 evidence introduced in each case should be considered as evidence in the other,\u00a0 and in\u00a0 the case of\u00a0 Froehlich &amp; Kuttner <i>vs.<\/i> Insular\u00a0 Collector of\u00a0 Customs it\u00a0 was\u00a0 stipulated\u00a0 that the evidence submitted in\u00a0 customs cases Nos,\u00a0 2, 10 and 14, which were appealed\u00a0 to this court, bearing R. G. No. 4316, should be\u00a0 submitted\u00a0 as evidence in that case,\u00a0 and\u00a0 such evidence is attached to the record on this appeal.<br\/><br\/>Paragraph 125 of the Philippine Tariif Revision Law of 1901, under which the undershirts in question were dutiable, provides that knitted goods\u00a0 are exempt from any\u00a0 surtax for \"the making-up.\"\u00a0 In the cases involved\u00a0 in R. G. No. 4316, reported in 11 Phil.\u00a0 Rep.,\u00a0 380\u00a0 (as\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 present cases), it was\u00a0 contended by\u00a0 the Insular Collector of\u00a0 Customs\u00a0 \"that the undershirt was practically complete before the application of the band or strip\u00a0 and that the purpose of the band was to enhance the value of the garment, give it a more ornamental\u00a0 appearance and make it more salable; that the\u00a0 band or strip was not made at the same time\u00a0 as the body of\u00a0 the undershirt\u00a0 but was\u00a0 afterwards\u00a0 added thereto; that the appraiser of textiles of the Manila custom-house testified that the undershirts in question in said cases were\u00a0 trimmed\u00a0 by the application of the colored edgings on the shirt and\u00a0 on\u00a0 account\u00a0 of the ornamental effect\u00a0 of the edging,\u00a0 the same having\u00a0 improved the\u00a0 appearance\u00a0 of the undershirts; although the edging was knitted and of the same\u00a0 fiber as the body\u00a0 of the undershirt, it was of a different pattern or design, and\u00a0 wherever the\u00a0 design\u00a0 was different the customs authorities considered\u00a0 it a different material; that in the cotton schedule as a whole dyed yarns are subject\u00a0 to\u00a0 a\u00a0 surtax, and\u00a0 for\u00a0 customs purposes are a different material.\"<br\/><br\/>The learned counsel\u00a0 for\u00a0 the appellant in\u00a0 these\u00a0 cases presents\u00a0 the following argument.\u00a0 He says:<br\/><blockquote>\"In addition\u00a0 to the provisions herein before quoted\u00a0 from the\u00a0 Tariff Revision Law of 1901,\u00a0 under which the\u00a0 duties and surtaxes were collected on the undershirts in question, there are a number\u00a0 or general\u00a0 rules and regulations set forth in\u00a0 section\u00a0 5 of\u00a0 said\u00a0 Tariff\u00a0 Revision\u00a0 Law to\u00a0 be observed in the construction and enforcement of the various provisions of\u00a0 said Act.\u00a0 Of these general rules,\u00a0 Nos, 2 to 12, inclusive,\u00a0 are\u00a0 referred to in\u00a0 said Rule B.\u00a0 An\u00a0 examination of these general rules <i>seriatim<\/i> shows\u00a0 that rule 1 has to do with the\u00a0 number of threads in a particular textile; rules 2\u00a0 to 7, inclusive, have to do with textiles composed of two\u00a0 or more materials, and\u00a0 rules\u00a0 8 to 12,\u00a0 inclusive, with surtaxes.\u00a0 Of the last mentioned, rule 10 is as follows:<br\/><br\/><i> \" 'Embroidery<\/i>. - Textiles embroidered by hand or machine after weaving or\u00a0 with application of trimmings shall\u00a0 be liable to the duties leviable thereon, plus the surtaxes established in every case.\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *'<br\/><br\/>\"An examination of Rule B (b), under Class IV, group 3, and\u00a0 of rule\u00a0 10, shows that they are\u00a0 very similar\u00a0 in wording, the surtax in each case\u00a0 being imposed on\u00a0 account of the same operation, i. e.,<i> embroidery\u00a0 or application of trimmings<\/i>; but it is Rule B (b)\u00a0 which\u00a0 establishes\u00a0 the amount of the surtax, and it is the one which must\u00a0 be applied.<br\/><br\/>\"As the surtax\u00a0 was imposed in this\u00a0 case because of\u00a0 an 'application of trimmings,'\u00a0 it becomes necessary to determine the meaning of this phrase.\u00a0 In the case of Froehlich &amp; Kuttner <i>vs.<\/i> Collector of Customs (11\u00a0 Phil. Rep.,\u00a0 380, 383), herein before referred to, this honorable\u00a0 court found that the\u00a0 word 'trimmings,'\u00a0 where\u00a0 it is used in\u00a0 Rule B (6), and in Rule A, clause 3, last paragraph,\u00a0 under Class IV, group 3, and\u00a0 in rule 7 and in rule 10, must be given the same\u00a0 meaning in each.\u00a0\u00a0 The appellant herein respectfully contends that such construction is erroneous,\u00a0 for the following\u00a0 reasons:<br\/><br\/>\"The\u00a0 'trimmings'\u00a0 referred\u00a0 to\u00a0 in general\u00a0 rule\u00a0 7\u00a0 and in Rule A, clause 3,\u00a0 last paragraph, under Class\u00a0 IV, are such as\u00a0 are imported in that form (for samples see exhibits on p. 59 of R. G. No. 4316 in this court), and not\u00a0 such as are imported as a part of a separate and completed article; in fact, the two are widely distinct, as a thing which, imported\u00a0 by itself, might not\u00a0 be considered\u00a0 a 'trimming,' may become so when attached to a completed article; thus buttons, which in themselves are not trimmings under the last two mentioned\u00a0 rules, may, if attached to\u00a0 a lady's dress for the purpose of\u00a0 ornamentation or decoration, trim that dress,\u00a0 and thus become an <i>application of trimmings<\/i> in so far as that\u00a0 particular dress\u00a0 is concerned.<br\/><br\/>\"It is claimed by the appellees in these cases\u00a0 that the band around the front opening and the neck\u00a0 of the undershirts is a necessary part of the garment, and that without it the\u00a0 article\u00a0 would unravel.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 appellant admits that a protecting band or a hem of some character is necessary, but respectfully insists that\u00a0 if\u00a0 a band is used of such a character\u00a0 as to ornament or decorate the garment, the surtax imposed by paragraph\u00a0 (6)\u00a0 of Rule B, above quoted, is properly payable\u00a0 on such garment. The bands upon the undershirts in question are of an ornamental design, of a different weave from\u00a0 that employed in the\u00a0 body of\u00a0 the garment,\u00a0 and they\u00a0 are generally woven of bright colors, clearly\u00a0 for the purpose of ornamenting\u00a0 or decorating the garment;\u00a0 an examination of the undershirts will readily show that such bands do ornament and decorate them, and this is\u00a0 also shown\u00a0 by the testimony of\u00a0 the\u00a0 witnesses for the appellant;\u00a0 and\u00a0 Mr. Meyer,\u00a0 a witness for Kuenzle &amp; Streiff, testified that this border or band on the undershirts\u00a0 makes them\u00a0 present\u00a0 a\u00a0 better appearance, but\u00a0 he afterwards, while testifying as a witness, seemed to be under the impression that he had\u00a0 made a mistake in\u00a0 admitting to the\u00a0 court that\u00a0 the band\u00a0 or\u00a0 border\u00a0 so placed on\u00a0 the undershirt gave it a better appearance.<br\/><br\/>\"Rule A, under\u00a0 Class IV, group\u00a0 3, and rule 7 having been shown to\u00a0 be inapplicable for the reasons stated, we have now\u00a0 only\u00a0 to consider the meaning of the words 'application of\u00a0 trimmings' as used in Rule B (<i>b<\/i>), under Class IV, group 3, and in rule 10.<br\/><br\/>\"An examination of the Century Dictionary\u00a0 shows the following definitions:<br\/><br\/>\"'Trim\u00a0 (to)\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>\"'4.

Collector of Customs\u00a0 (11 Phil.\u00a0 Rep.,\u00a0 380,\u00a0 383)\u00a0 is also\u00a0 shown by the testimony of Max\u00a0 Protzen\u00a0 in\u00a0 behalf of the appellees herein, in which he\u00a0 admitted that trimmings might be\u00a0 other than\u00a0 plaited; that is to\u00a0 say, 'trimming is\u00a0 not always plaited\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 * whether an article is\u00a0 a trimming\u00a0 or not does not depend upon\u00a0 whether it is knitted, or plaited.\u00a0 A trimming\u00a0 may be\u00a0 woven, or\u00a0 plaited\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 V\u00a0 (R.\u00a0 G.\u00a0 No.\u00a0 5600,\u00a0 pp. 38-42.) \"It is respectfully submitted that this erroneous meaning was given by the court to the word 'trimmings'\u00a0 by reason of the confusion\u00a0 of rule 7, which has only to do with the importation of articles\u00a0 known as 'trimmings' when imported\u00a0 in that form,\u00a0 and not\u00a0 as\u00a0 a part of a\u00a0 completed garment, and even\u00a0 then referred\u00a0 only to\u00a0 the\u00a0 method\u00a0 of treatment to be applied to such of\u00a0 them as were composed of more than one textile\u00a0 material.\u00a0 This is also\u00a0 true\u00a0 of Rule\u00a0 A, under Class IV, group 3; in\u00a0 other words, there are certain textiles which are always trimmings no matter whether imported as such, or as a portion of a completed garment. Rule 7 and Rule A,\u00a0 above cited,\u00a0 are applicable to them when imported separately.\u00a0 Then there are certain other articles which\u00a0 are imported separately and not technically known as\u00a0 'trimmings,'\u00a0 such as\u00a0 buttons, laces,\u00a0 ribbons,\u00a0 galloons,\u00a0 etc., but which,\u00a0 if attached\u00a0 to a completed article in such a\u00a0 way as to decorate or ornament it, trim the same and thereby become trimmings, notwithstanding the fact that they are not plaited as mentioned in rule 7; in fact, as shown by the\u00a0 testimony of Mr. Protzen in the trial of these cases,<i> all\u00a0 trimmings are not plaited. <\/i><br\/><br\/>\"Wherefore, the appellant respectfully contends that the band\u00a0 or border\u00a0 attached to the undershirts in question, being of a different design,\u00a0 stitch, color, and appearance from the body of the garment and ornamental and decorative in\u00a0 character, effectively trims the garment\u00a0 and\u00a0 adds to its attractiveness and value, and, in so far as the particular\u00a0 garment is concerned, has become a\u00a0 trimming of the undershirt.\u00a0\u00a0 These\u00a0 bands or borders are not knitted as an integral\u00a0 part of the garment, but are knitted separately and are applied thereto by being stitched or sewn to the garment in the same way as a ribbon\u00a0 would have been if it had been considered desirable to use\u00a0 a ribbon instead of the\u00a0 band.\u00a0\u00a0 Had\u00a0 a ribbon\u00a0 been used,\u00a0 it\u00a0 surely would not have been contended that the garment would not\u00a0 have had an\u00a0 <i>application of trimmings, <\/i>notwithstanding the fact that ribbons are\u00a0 differentiated from trimmings by\u00a0 said rule 7.\"<\/blockquote>We proceed to\u00a0 an examination of\u00a0 that argument:<br\/><br\/>In these cases\u00a0 we have knitted undershirts.\u00a0 That\u00a0 part of such undershirts which has\u00a0 caused\u00a0 this\u00a0 litigation is the band running around\u00a0 the neck and down\u00a0 the edges of the opening in the front.\u00a0 In this band the stitch, as\u00a0 compared with that\u00a0 in the body\u00a0 of the garment,\u00a0 has\u00a0 been changed in form\u00a0 and has been placed, generally\u00a0 speaking, at right angles thereto.\u00a0\u00a0 The material is of the same\u00a0 kind and quality as the body\u00a0 of the garment.\u00a0\u00a0 This band seems to have been knitted separately and sewn to\u00a0 the shirt as a separate piece.\u00a0\u00a0 It is, generally speaking,\u00a0 about three-quarters of an inch wide.\u00a0 It was knitted originally about one and one-half\u00a0 inches wide\u00a0 and then\u00a0 folded\u00a0 on itself. It was attached to the shirt by taking the raw edge forming the neck and the opening in the front of the shirt and placing it between the two edges of the folded\u00a0 band and sewing all three edges\u00a0 together, leaving\u00a0 the\u00a0 band\u00a0 about three-quarters of an\u00a0 inch wide.\u00a0\u00a0 The variation in the form of the stitch noticed in the band consists,\u00a0 in most of the exhibits, simply of a change which slightly raises the surface of certain parts of the\u00a0 band into\u00a0 little ridges, with\u00a0 small open\u00a0 spaces at regular intervals between, giving the\u00a0 outer surface of the whole band a rough but\u00a0 agreeable\u00a0 appearance, a\u00a0 slight depression and\u00a0 open space following each raised portion with fair regularity.\u00a0 In\u00a0 others\u00a0 of the exhibits the outer and\u00a0 inner\u00a0 edges\u00a0 of the band, for about one-eighth of an inch,\u00a0 are\u00a0 made\u00a0 up of\u00a0 stitches\u00a0 substantially the same\u00a0 as the stitch in the body of the garment, the central\u00a0 portion of the band lying between\u00a0 these two parts being of a different stitch and one\u00a0 which raises the surface of that portion noticeably above the parts referred to and giving to such raised portion an open-work appearance.\u00a0\u00a0 In all of the exhibits the outer edges of the bands are indented or\u00a0 notched.\u00a0 In one of the exhibits\u00a0 no colored yarn\u00a0 is used in the band, it being of the same color as the garment itself.\u00a0\u00a0 In another\u00a0 the colored\u00a0 portion consists simply\u00a0 of a very\u00a0 narrow line of\u00a0 dark\u00a0 blue which\u00a0 runs along the band next to the indented edge.\u00a0 In another the raised central portion is\u00a0 composed of yarn which is whiter than\u00a0 that in\u00a0 the body\u00a0 of the\u00a0 garment;\u00a0 and the\u00a0 tips of the little points made by the indentations in the edge of the band are also composed\u00a0 of\u00a0 whiter yarn.\u00a0\u00a0 In\u00a0 others of the exhibits, there are two colors introduced into the band, in some to a greater extent\u00a0 than in others.<br\/><br\/>(1)\u00a0 Under these facts it is evident that the ornamentation so strongly\u00a0 urged by the\u00a0 appellant,\u00a0 if any at all in the real sense of the word,\u00a0 is clearly\u00a0 and conspicuously so incidental to.\u00a0 the\u00a0 main purpose\u00a0 of the band\u00a0 as to be negligible.\u00a0 In none of the exhibits\u00a0 have\u00a0 we been able to discover a flower, a figure, a\u00a0 pattern or a design.\u00a0\u00a0 If there is any design at all it lies in the\u00a0 <i>form of the stitch<\/i> and not in the <i>product<\/i> of the stitch; that is,\u00a0 while there is\u00a0 a change\u00a0 of stitch in the\u00a0 band as compared with the\u00a0 body of the garment, that changed stitch is not.used to create a design, a flower,\u00a0 a figure or pattern.\u00a0\u00a0 In other words, the manufacturer, when he made the change in stitch, had no intention to create anything more than a plain,\u00a0 useful shirt band.\u00a0 As we say, later, the changed stitch used in making the band lent itself far more readily to the purpose in view, namely, to prevent stretching and rolling, than the stitch in the body of the garment.\u00a0 It is possible that, in the judgment of some, the stitch\u00a0 used in the band is more attractive to the eye than the stitch in the remainder of the garment.\u00a0 That is a question of taste.\u00a0 The point is that there\u00a0 is found in the product of that stitch <i>no flower, pattern, figure,\u00a0 or design of\u00a0 any\u00a0 kind. <\/i> There is,\u00a0 so\u00a0 far as form is\u00a0 concerned,\u00a0 no attempt at ornamentation.\u00a0\u00a0 There appears simply\u00a0 a succession of stitches, running in a series of straight lines along the bands, without theory, thought, conception, design,\u00a0 pattern or figure.\u00a0 Remove the offending stitch, and\u00a0 replace it with the stitch used in the remainder\u00a0 of the\u00a0 garment\u00a0 and, although a different colored thread be\u00a0 used to\u00a0 maintain the outlines formed by the changed stitch, there remains absolutely nothing of design, pattern, figure or form.\u00a0\u00a0 Straight lines alone characterize the result.\u00a0 It is the <i>stitch<\/i> itself which\u00a0 is\u00a0 changed and <i>not the thing which\u00a0 the stitch makes up or composes.<br\/><\/i><br\/>There being no conception\u00a0 of figure, pattern or design in the <i>form<\/i> of the alleged ornamentation, the fact that colored yarn or thread was\u00a0 used\u00a0 to a slight extent in some of the bands does not, in our judgment, produce the effects contended for\u00a0 by the appellant.\u00a0\u00a0 The colored thread traces no flower, design, figure or pattern.\u00a0\u00a0 It is uncontradicted that the cost of manufacture,\u00a0 or\u00a0 the value, or the retail price of the garment was\u00a0 not enhanced\u00a0 thereby.\u00a0 Its utility was neither increased nor diminished.\u00a0 The coloring matter introduced\u00a0 is not,\u00a0 in any true sense, a luxury.\u00a0\u00a0 Even though it be\u00a0 decorative, which may well be doubted, it\u00a0 bears so small a relation to the whole purpose of the band as to be an\u00a0 incident without significance: - at\u00a0 least, without the significance attached to it by the appellant, or such as it would be necessary to attach to it to reach the result for which he contends.\u00a0 The color does not necessarily make the band a trimming. And it must be borne in mind that the basis of the classification made by the\u00a0 appellant, as well as of his argument\u00a0 on this appeal,\u00a0 is that the band is a\u00a0 <i>trimming by reason of its\u00a0 being\u00a0 ornamental in design and\u00a0 color. <\/i>\u00a0 The coloring matter does not change the fact that the band is necessary to make the shirt a shirt;\u00a0 and its effect upon the garment as\u00a0 a whole is so slight as to be substantially without significance under the\u00a0 facts of this case.<br\/><br\/>(2) <i>The garment is not complete without the\u00a0 band<\/i> - that portion of the garment which, it is alleged, renders it liable to such\u00a0 tax.\u00a0 The undershirt would not be a\u00a0 completed garment without something to cover the raw edges of the collar and the\u00a0 opening in the front.\u00a0 Without\u00a0 this, these edges would stretch\u00a0 and roll,\u00a0 as\u00a0 well as unravel.\u00a0 To be sure,\u00a0 the stitches at the edges might be tied or fastened, but they would, notwithstanding, still\u00a0 stretch and\u00a0 roll to such an extent as to render the garment substantially worthless.\u00a0\u00a0 Something more was necessary;\u00a0 either\u00a0 a pjece of material different from\u00a0 the body of the garment had to be attached to prevent the\u00a0 stretch and the roll\u00a0 or else the material composing the\u00a0 body\u00a0 of\u00a0 the garment\u00a0 had to\u00a0 be extended and adapted to that purpose.\u00a0 From these exhibits it is clear and undoubted that if the additional piece required to prevent the stretch and the roll were made from the same material and with the same stitch, the\u00a0 purpose\u00a0 would still not be served.\u00a0\u00a0 The reason is that the stretch and\u00a0 the\u00a0 roll would still be present, even\u00a0 though the material\u00a0 be doubled or trebled.\u00a0 The form of\u00a0 the\u00a0 stitch used in knitting\u00a0 the body\u00a0 of the undershirts admits of a stretch in\u00a0 one direction and a roll in the other and they are\u00a0 nearly as pronounced when the material is doubled or trebled as when single.\u00a0\u00a0 It was necessary,\u00a0 therefore, to change\u00a0 the\u00a0 form\u00a0 of the stitch if the stretch and the roll were to be avoided.\u00a0\u00a0 This is what was done.\u00a0 The form of\u00a0 the stitch was changed in making the part which was to serve as\u00a0 a band around the neck and down the front; and, to insure\u00a0 the result, the stitch of this part was placed at right angles to the stitch of the body of the garment.\u00a0 These two things prevent stretch, avert rolling, avoid unraveling, and make the garment complete.\u00a0\u00a0 The fact that the band is a separate piece is, under the circumstances, of slight consequence.\u00a0 It is\u00a0 of the same material as the body of the garment.\u00a0 That it was knitted separately and placed on the shirt as a separate piece is not of sufficient importance, under the facts of this case, to sustain the contention of the defendant.\u00a0 Of what importance to anyone, or for any purpose of this case,\u00a0 is the fact\u00a0 that it was a separate piece?\u00a0 What different result follows whether the garment be left on\u00a0 the\u00a0 machine while the band is knitted without interruption of the continuity\u00a0 of the process, or whether the garment be laid aside while\u00a0 the band is knitted, to be attached later?\u00a0 Unquestionably the process followed by the manufacturer, that of knitting the band separately, is cheaper, requiring less labor and less expense.\u00a0 The thing to be considered\u00a0 under the facts of this case is the result which was attained.\u00a0 Did the separate knitting involve more labor?\u00a0 Did it result in a higher cost of manufacture?\u00a0 Did it increase the proportion of ornamentation?\u00a0\u00a0 Did it detract from the utility?\u00a0 Did\u00a0 it\u00a0 result in more luxury and less necessity?\u00a0\u00a0 Was it less a completion of the garment than it would have\u00a0 been\u00a0 if not knitted separately?\u00a0\u00a0 Clearly not. The result had in mind and, that obtained\u00a0 was <i>the completion of the garment <\/i> - and that with the least possible cost to the manufacturer and the greatest\u00a0 possible\u00a0 utility to the\u00a0 purchaser.\u00a0 It should be noticed also that, as to knitted goods, there is no\u00a0 surtax for the \"making-up.\"\u00a0 This phrase includes the completed garment, collar band\u00a0 and all.<br\/><br\/>Thus far\u00a0 we have found that, in the\u00a0 bands in question, there\u00a0 is no ornamentation,\u00a0 either of design or color,\u00a0 in the sense\u00a0 asserted\u00a0 by the learned counsel for the appellant; that, if there is ornamentation of any kind or\u00a0 in any sense, it is, under the facts and circumstances presented, so insignificant, in comparison with the real purpose of the band, as to be unimportant, even negligible.<br\/><br\/>But there\u00a0 are other points from which this case should be viewed.<br\/><br\/>(3)\u00a0 Rule 8 establishes surtaxes generally.\u00a0 It reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"Rule\u00a0 8. <i>Establishment\u00a0 of surtaxes<\/i>. - The surtaxes applicable owing\u00a0 to broche,\u00a0 embroidery,\u00a0 metal threads, or making up, shall always be computed on the duties leviable on the\u00a0 textile by taking into account, if necessary, the increase of such duties in case of admixture.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Rules 9 and 10 read as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Rule\u00a0 9.<i> Broches.<\/i>\u00a0 - Textiles,\u00a0 broches or woven like brocades,\u00a0 with silk or floss silk, shall be liable to the duties leviable thereon plus the surtaxes established in\u00a0 every case. (Class IV, group 3, Rule B, letter (<i>a<\/i>), and Class V, group 2, Rule B, letter (<i>a<\/i>).)<br\/><br\/>Broches or brocaded textiles are all textiles with flowers or other ornaments applied\u00a0 by means of a shuttle in such a manner that\u00a0 the threads do not occupy the entire width of the stuff, but\u00a0 only the space comprising the flower or pattern.<br\/><br\/>\"Rule\u00a0 10. <i>Embroidery. <\/i>- Textiles embroidered by hand or machine after weaving or with application of trimmings shall be liable to the duties leviable thereon, plus the surtaxes established in every case.\u00a0\u00a0 (Class IV, group 3, Rule B, letter (<i>b<\/i>) ; Class V, group 2, Rule B, letter (<i>b)<\/i>.)<br\/><br\/>\"Embroidery is distinguished from patterns woven in the textile as the latter are destroyed by unraveling the\u00a0 weft of the textile, while embroidery is\u00a0 independent of the warp and weft\u00a0 and can not be unraveled.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>These rules establish two\u00a0 kinds of handiwork upon which a surtax shall be imposed:<br\/><br\/><i>(a<\/i>)\u00a0 Upon those textiles whose normal structure has been varied by the introduction of <i>\"flowers or other ornaments applied by means of a\u00a0 shuttle,\"<\/i>\u00a0 which\u00a0 ornaments are a constituent and\u00a0 component\u00a0 part of the body of the fabric to such an extent that the removal of the ornamental design <i>destroys the\u00a0 textile<\/i> as such.\u00a0 This is clearly apparent\u00a0 not only\u00a0 from the use of the words \"applied by means of a shuttle,\" which show conclusively that the ornamental design is woven as an integral part of the textile, but also from the words \"in such manner that the threads do not occupy the entire width of the stuff, but only the space comprising the <i>flower or pattern.\"<\/i><br\/><br\/>From these\u00a0 paragraphs of Rule 9 it\u00a0 is clear that the ornamental design\u00a0 occupies a portion of\u00a0 the\u00a0 textile\u00a0 which would have been occupied by the normal textile if the ornamental design\u00a0 had not been introduced;\u00a0 and that\u00a0 if the design\u00a0 were removed there\u00a0 would result\u00a0 in\u00a0 the textile a vacant\u00a0 space or hole of the size of the design.<br\/><br\/>(<i>b<\/i>) Upon those textiles whose normal structure has not been\u00a0 varied.\u00a0 In this class of textiles the variation consists in <i>superadding something to the normal texture of the\u00a0 fabric after it has been completed.<\/i>\u00a0 In other words, in this case, the variant may\u00a0 be removed without destroying,\u00a0 or even injuring in the slightest degree, the body of the fabric; that is, without\u00a0 leaving in the fabric a vacant space\u00a0 or hole. This is apparent from Rule 10, already quoted.<br\/><br\/>The division into these two classes made by Rules 8, 9 and 10 is made clear beyond question by the second paragraph of Rule 10,\u00a0 just quoted,\u00a0 where it says:\u00a0 \"Embroidery is distinguished from <i>patterns woven in the textile,'<\/i> the words italicized referring to the \"flowers\u00a0 or other ornaments <i>applied\u00a0 by means of a shuttle\"<\/i> which occupy \"only the\u00a0 space comprising the flower ot pattern.\"<br\/><br\/>Having observed these two classes of variants from the normal structure\u00a0 of the fabric, it is necessary to note next that \"trimmings\" are placed by Rule 10 <i>in\u00a0 the second class,<\/i> namely, those variants which are not an integral part of the body\u00a0 of the textile, which\u00a0 are not intended to complete it in any true sense,\u00a0 but\u00a0 are something foreign which\u00a0 is superadded to the textile and which may be removed without destroying the fabric itself or the practical utility thereof.<br\/><br\/>What is the significance of this division\u00a0 into classes and of the difference in the amount of duties assessed by the law upon\u00a0 each of said classes?\u00a0\u00a0 It is found\u00a0 very largely in the difference met in the meaning of the expressions \"necessity\" and \"luxury,\" \"utility\" and \"ornamentation.\"\u00a0 One of the principles governing the\u00a0 Congress in passing the Customs Tariff Act under consideration, was\u00a0 that, apart from\u00a0 the duties imposed for the protection of\u00a0 home industries, luxuries, not necessities, should pay the heaviest duties.\u00a0 This clearly\u00a0 appears from the law under consideration.\u00a0 It is <i>very largely\u00a0 luxuries upon which the surtax is imposed by<\/i> the\u00a0 law.\u00a0 Observe the provisions of Rule B, down to and including paragraph (c) group 3, Class IV.\u00a0 It reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"Rule\u00a0 B.\u00a0 Articles\u00a0 included\u00a0 in\u00a0 this\u00a0 group, which are within\u00a0 the under-mentioned conditions, shall be liable to the following surtaxes (see rules two to twelve, inclusive):<br\/><br\/>\"(<i>a<\/i>)\u00a0 Textiles broch6s,\u00a0 or woven-like\u00a0 brocades with silk or floss silk, shall be\u00a0 liable to the duties\u00a0 leviable thereon, plus a surtax of thirty per centum.<br\/><br\/>\"(<i>b<\/i>)\u00a0 Textiles embroidered by hand or by machine after weaving or with\u00a0 application\u00a0 of trimmings shall be liable to the duties\u00a0 leviable\u00a0 thereon, plus\u00a0 a surtax\u00a0 of\u00a0 thirty per centum.<br\/><br\/>\"Should the embroidery contain threads, purl, or spangles of common metal or of silver the surtax shall amount to sixty per centum of the duties applicable to the textile.<br\/><br\/>\"When\u00a0 the threads, purl, or spangles\u00a0 are of gold the surtax shall\u00a0 be one\u00a0 hundred per centum.<br\/><br\/>\" (<i>c<\/i>)\u00a0 Textiles and trimmings containing threads, or purl of common metals or\u00a0 silver, shall be\u00a0 liable to a surtax of fifty per centum of the duties leviable thereon.<br\/><br\/>\"When the threads\u00a0 or\u00a0 purl are of gold the surtax shall amount to one hundred per centum.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>We have already\u00a0 noted that, under General Rules 8, 9 and\u00a0 10, establishing surtaxes, articles subject to such tax are by said rules\u00a0 divided\u00a0 into two classes: One class composed of those textiles where the variant is an integral and essential part of the fabric, and the other, of those where the variant is not an integral or essential part of the fabric. In the former class the variant is far more <i>useful <\/i>than in the latter.\u00a0 In fact, in the latter class the real\u00a0 necessity of the variant is almost wholly lacking.\u00a0\u00a0 It is not a surprise, therefore, to find, under Rule B, that, in the former case,\u00a0 where\u00a0 the\u00a0 utility\u00a0 (necessity)\u00a0 and ornamentation (luxury)\u00a0 are both about\u00a0 equally\u00a0 present, the\u00a0 surtax\u00a0 is only one-half of what it\u00a0 is in the\u00a0 latter\u00a0 case, where the utility (necessity)\u00a0 has\u00a0 decreased very materially and the ornamentation\u00a0 (luxury)\u00a0 has increased so\u00a0 as to be plainly predominant.\u00a0 This is\u00a0 still more strikingly presented\u00a0 in the remaining paragraph of Rule B.\u00a0\u00a0 Under this paragraph, which provides that, where the embroidery or textile and trimmings contain\u00a0 threads, purl, or spangles1 of common metal or\u00a0 silver, the surtax shall be doubled, and\u00a0 where the threads,\u00a0 purl, or spangles are of gold,\u00a0 the\u00a0 surtax\u00a0 is required to be almost doubled\u00a0 again, being 100 per centum of the duties leviable thereon.<br\/><br\/>From these facts it is patent that as the utility\u00a0 of the variant decreases, and the ornamentation\u00a0 correspondingly increases,\u00a0 the surtax imposed is more than proportionately severe;\u00a0 that where the material of\u00a0 the offending article\u00a0 is the same\u00a0 as the body\u00a0 of the garment, and its primary and main\u00a0 purpose is really and essentially to complete, the garment and not\u00a0 to adorn it - that is, to fulfill\u00a0 the requirements of utility and\u00a0 necessity and not those of ornamentation and luxury,\u00a0 the ornamentation, if any,\u00a0 being conspicuously insignificant compared with the primary and main\u00a0 purpose\u00a0 of\u00a0 the article - no\u00a0 surtaxes\u00a0 are imposed. Trimmings being, under the\u00a0 classification of the\u00a0 law,\u00a0 as we\u00a0 have seen, clearly of the latter class - namely,\u00a0 that class where the primary and main purpose\u00a0 is ornamentation and luxury \u2014and the bands\u00a0 in question being as clearly of the former class - namely,\u00a0 that\u00a0 class where the\u00a0 article is of\u00a0 the\u00a0 same material as the body of the garment and the primary and main purpose is conspicuously utility and necessity - the bands are not trimmings within the meaning of the law, and are, therefore, not subject to the surtax levied by the Insular Collector of Customs in these cases.<br\/><br\/>(4)\u00a0 The appellant,\u00a0 therefore, in\u00a0 assessing the\u00a0 duties which form the basis of this controversy,\u00a0 has run\u00a0 counter to the apparent intent and purpose of the act as well as to one of the principles which underlie the Customs Tariff Act already mentioned,\u00a0 namely, that, generally\u00a0 speaking and apart from the theory of the protection of home industries, luxuries and not necessities shall\u00a0 pay the heaviest duties.\u00a0 That\u00a0 the undershirts in\u00a0 question are\u00a0 necessities of life is unquestioned.\u00a0\u00a0 That the offending bands are necessary parts of those shirts is, in our judgment, equally unquestioned.\u00a0 An additional duty following the attachment of the band is, therefore, in its result,\u00a0 under the conditions reigning in the Islands, a tax upon a\u00a0 necessity of life.\u00a0 It is the\u00a0 uncontradicted\u00a0 proof that the\u00a0 change in the form of the\u00a0 stitch in the bands and the introduction of colored yarns\u00a0 therein\u00a0 require\u00a0 no additional labor, do not add to the cost of manufacture, to the value, or to the wholesale or retail price of the garment.\u00a0 Why impose\u00a0 a surtax? The law does not specifically require it.\u00a0 We are unable to find a\u00a0 single reason of state\u00a0 polity that requires it.\u00a0\u00a0 On the contrary, every reason is against its imposition.\u00a0\u00a0 Such duty can not be fully\u00a0 supported upon\u00a0 the\u00a0 theory\u00a0 predominant\u00a0 in the United States that it does\u00a0 not result in a tax on the consumer.\u00a0 Here, at the present time, the reasons advanced to support\u00a0 that theory,\u00a0 even though valid, do not\u00a0 apply\u00a0 with the same force as in the United States. Under\u00a0 the\u00a0 conditions\u00a0 existing\u00a0 here\u00a0 the\u00a0 additional\u00a0 duty imposed is partly, at least,\u00a0 a tax upon\u00a0 the\u00a0 consumer. Moreover, it is a tax upon the poorest class of consumers. The undershirts represented in these cases are of the cheapest grade, for the use of the poorest class of people, selling in the\u00a0 market at retail for about fifty\u00a0 centavos each.\u00a0\u00a0 The imposition\u00a0 of the\u00a0 proposed surtax, therefore,\u00a0 strikes at the pockets of the very poor, the class that\u00a0 can least afford to pay it.\u00a0 In the absence of provisions of\u00a0 law to the contrary,\u00a0 we will\u00a0 not,\u00a0 by construction, impose a tax upon a necessity of life, to be paid almost exclusively by the poorest of the\u00a0 people.<br\/><br\/>(5)\u00a0 We believe also\u00a0 that the position and the argument of the\u00a0 learned counsel for the\u00a0 appellant is\u00a0 contrary to another principle\u00a0 of\u00a0 construction of customs\u00a0 revenue Acts, namely, that, where the question\u00a0 whether or not the duty ought to\u00a0 be imposed is doubtful,\u00a0 the doubt should be resolved in favor of the importer.\u00a0\u00a0 That there is\u00a0 doubt in the cases at bar is clear.\u00a0 That there is ambiguity in the phraseology of the Act is also clear.\u00a0 The position of the appellant in these cases, taken in\u00a0 connection with the previous decision of this court (11 Phil. Rep., 380) upon the same questions\u00a0 as\u00a0 are\u00a0 here involved,\u00a0 proves beyond question that\u00a0 the\u00a0 imposition of the surtax upon the garments in controversy is of doubtful validity.\u00a0 The assertion of the learned counsel for the appellant that the word \"trimmings\" when used in one paragraph of the law means one thing, and, when\u00a0 used in the same\u00a0 law only three paragraphs later, means another and somewhat different thing, is evidence of\u00a0 the strongest character\u00a0 that\u00a0 there\u00a0 is not\u00a0 only doubt, but grave doubt of the legality of the proposed imposition.\u00a0 This is particularly apparent when we take into consideration the general rule of statutory construction that a word used in\u00a0 a statute in a\u00a0 given\u00a0 sense is presumed to be used in the same sense throughout the law.\u00a0\u00a0 (Sutherland on\u00a0 Statutory\u00a0 Construction, chap.\u00a0 255.)\u00a0\u00a0 While this\u00a0 rule is not, by some authorities, regarded as so rigid and peremptory as some other of the rules of construction, nevertheless it\u00a0 is\u00a0 particularly\u00a0 applicable in the\u00a0 cases at\u00a0 bar,\u00a0 <i>where in\u00a0 the statute the\u00a0 words appear\u00a0 so\u00a0 near to each other physically, and\u00a0 particularly where the word has\u00a0 a technical meaning and\u00a0 that meaning\u00a0 has been defined in\u00a0 the statute.\u00a0 <\/i> We do not, however,\u00a0 decide whether the\u00a0 word \"trimming\" means the\u00a0 same or\u00a0 a different thing when used in different parts of the Act.<br\/><br\/>From all this\u00a0 it is patent and clear that there is at least doubt as to the legality\u00a0 of the surtax sought to be imposed in\u00a0 these\u00a0 cases.\u00a0 In\u00a0 the case of Hartranft <i>vs<\/i>.\u00a0 Weigmann (121 U. S., 609, 616), the court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"But, if the question were one of doubt,\u00a0 the doubt would be resolved\u00a0 in favor of the importer,\u00a0 'as duties are never imposed upon the citizen upon vague\u00a0 or doubtful interpretations.' \"<br\/><\/blockquote>To the same effect are American Net and Twine Co. <i>vs.<\/i> Worthington (141 U.\u00a0 S., 468); <i>In re<\/i>\u00a0 Fellheimer et al.

material findings of fact as set out in the opinion of the trial judge, and leaves no room for reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the defendants and appellants of the crime\u00a0 of<i> asesinato<\/i> (assassination)\u00a0 with which they are charged\u00a0 in the information.<br\/><br\/>The appellants, Isidoro Alias, Benito\u00a0 Castro and Brigido Binis, together\u00a0 with Rufino Agnis and Pablo Camino, (as to whom the information was dismissed in the court below\u00a0 in\u00a0 order that they might be called upon to testify for the prosecution) went at a late hour of the night of the 24th of January, 1910, to\u00a0 a house wherein they surprised and\u00a0 captured Ponciano\u00a0 Miral,\u00a0 deceased.\u00a0 In obedience to\u00a0 orders given by Alias, Castro and\u00a0 Binis tied the prisoner's arms together.\u00a0 Alias, who was the moving spirit of the party, by whom it was organized,\u00a0 and under whose orders it\u00a0 operated, struck\u00a0 Miral with\u00a0 his fist\u00a0 and\u00a0 said to him: <i>\"Tu has destruido nuestro\u00a0 hogar.\u00a0 No sabes que esta es mi casa?\"\u00a0 <\/i> (You have destroyed our home.\u00a0 Don't you know that this is my house?)\u00a0 Thereafter by\u00a0 direction of Alias,\u00a0 Miral,\u00a0 still with\u00a0 his elbows\u00a0 tied behind his back, was led away some distance from the house by Castro, Binis and\u00a0 Agnis,\u00a0 Alias himself\u00a0 staying\u00a0 in the house with the woman who had been living there as the<i> querida<\/i> (paramour) of Miral, and\u00a0 who had formerly\u00a0 borne a similar relation to Alias but had deserted him to go\u00a0 to\u00a0 Miral.\u00a0\u00a0 Just before the prisoner was led\u00a0 away from the\u00a0 house,\u00a0 Alias whispered something to Binis.\u00a0\u00a0 When the party with the prisoner reached a deserted place\u00a0 in a tract of hemp land, in the barrio of Manaybanay\u00a0 in the municipality of Dagami, Castro suddenly struck\u00a0 the\u00a0 prisoner on the\u00a0 side of the\u00a0 head with a\u00a0 heavy club and felled him\u00a0 to the ground,\u00a0 where- upon\u00a0 Binis\u00a0 struck the prostrate man\u00a0 in the breast\u00a0 with a bolo,\u00a0 inflicting a fatal wound.\u00a0\u00a0 Early on\u00a0 the following morning the\u00a0 corpse was\u00a0 buried in the\u00a0 barrio of Malirung by the murderers, still acting under the direction of Alias, who accompanied and assisted them on\u00a0 that occasion.<br\/><br\/>Upon these facts we think that the court properly found Alias,\u00a0 Castro, and Binis\u00a0 guilty of the crime of asesinato (murder in the first degree).\u00a0 The\u00a0 element of treachery undoubtedly marked the\u00a0 unlawful killing of the deceased, who was bound and defenseless when he was done to death by his aggressors.\u00a0\u00a0 (Art. 10, Penal Code.)\u00a0 This qualifying circumstance brought the unlawful killing\u00a0 of the deceased under\u00a0 the\u00a0 definition\u00a0 of\u00a0 the crime\u00a0 of asesinato as defined and penalized in\u00a0 article 403 of the code.<br\/><br\/>The commission of the\u00a0 crime of <i>asesinato<\/i> (murder)\u00a0 was marked with two aggravating circumstances,\u00a0 in that it\u00a0 was done in the night\u00a0 and in a deserted\u00a0 place (art.\u00a0 10,\u00a0 Penal Code), and no extenuating circumstances, except as to Binis, who appears\u00a0 to have been less than eighteen years of\u00a0 age (art. 85, Penal Code).<br\/><br\/>The penalty of\u00a0 death\u00a0 imposed by\u00a0 the trial\u00a0 court upon Alias arid Castro should therefore be affirmed, that being the maximum penalty prescribed by\u00a0 the code for the offense of which they were guilty, but the penalty of death imposed by the\u00a0 trial\u00a0 court\u00a0 upon Binis must be reversed, the evidence disclosing, and the trial judge having expressly found that he was less than eighteen years\u00a0 of age at the time when the crime\u00a0 was committed.\u00a0\u00a0 The penalty which should have been imposed\u00a0 upon him is the maximum degree of the \"penalty\u00a0 immediately inferior\" to\u00a0 that\u00a0 prescribed by the code for the crime of <i>asesinato<\/i> of which he\u00a0 was convicted, that is to say, the maximum degree of the penalty of from ten years and one day of <i>presidio mayor<\/i> to sevenn years and four months\u00a0 of <i>cadena temporal,<\/i> which is cadena temporal in its medium degree.<br\/><br\/>We therefore affirm the sentence of death together with the accessory penalties prescribed\u00a0 by law,\u00a0 imposed by\u00a0 the trial court upon the appellants, Isidoro Alias and Benito Castro, but reverse the sentence\u00a0 imposed by the trial court upon the appellant, Brigido Binis, and in\u00a0 lieu thereof we sentence him\u00a0 to\u00a0 14 years, 8\u00a0 months and 1 day of<i> cadena temporal,<\/i>\u00a0 together with the accessory penalties\u00a0 prescribed by law, and to the payment to the heirs\u00a0 of the deceased of the sum\u00a0 of Pl,000.\u00a0 A proportionate\u00a0 share of the costs of this instance will be\u00a0 charged against each\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0

The Court of First Instance of Tarlac, in conformity with the prayer of the complaint, decide that the plaintiff was entitled to redeem the land described\u00a0 in the comp (which redemption had been\u00a0 opposed\u00a0 by Juan Tabliga), upon payment to the defendant, Juan Tabliga, of the sum for which\u00a0 the latter had purchased it and, in addition, of the amount of the interest thereon,\u00a0 at per cent per annum, up\u00a0 to\u00a0 the time when the\u00a0 said plaintiff offered to redeem the land, and\u00a0 at\u00a0 6\u00a0 per cent from the date of the said offer.<br\/><br\/>No appeal was taken with respect to the right to redeem upon payment of the\u00a0 price\u00a0 of the\u00a0 sale; but the plaintiff appealed on\u00a0 account of the following assignments of error:<br\/><ol type=\"1\"><li>Because\u00a0 the judgment did not\u00a0 allow\u00a0 him damages at the rate of Pl,000 a\u00a0 year, from\u00a0 at least the 23d day of March,\u00a0 1907; thus violation sections 93, 126, and 409\u00a0 of Act No. 190, the Code of Civil Procedure.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>Because\u00a0 it compelled him to pay the 6 per cent,\u00a0 in addition to the per cent interest, on the sum which the defendant refused to receive as. price of redemption; thus violating article\u00a0 1100\u00a0 of the\u00a0 Civil Code an section 465 of the aforesaid Act\u00a0 No. 190.<\/li><\/ol>With regard to the\u00a0 first error assigned, the\u00a0 trial\u00a0 court stated in it from\u00a0 the evidence:\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 That it did not deem the estimate of P1,000 to be either just or correct as the value of\u00a0 the products, in\u00a0 one year, o .small an area of land,\u00a0 not even though it contained a fishery; and (2) that the\u00a0 only proof presented,\u00a0 to\u00a0 wit, the testimony of the plaintiff not\u00a0 satisfied the court, and\u00a0 that\u00a0 in due time it had\u00a0 indicated\u00a0 to t attorneys the necessity of presenting satisfactory proof,\u00a0 and that,\u00a0 as had not adduced any further evidence in\u00a0 this matter,\u00a0 it concluded that would be improper\u00a0 to\u00a0 allow\u00a0 damages, which\u00a0 were not satisfactorily proved, in the amount requested. This court can not,\u00a0 in cases like this at a different conclusion.\u00a0\u00a0 The existence\u00a0 and\u00a0 amount of\u00a0 the\u00a0 damages must be proved; otherwise, it\u00a0 is not possible to\u00a0 determine the obi lo pay\u00a0 them.<br\/><br\/>By the citation\u00a0 of\u00a0 section 93 of the Code of\u00a0 Civil Procedure,\u00a0 the appellant\u00a0 apparently wishes it to be understood that, the defendant not having demurred to the complaint, nor denied in his answer the facts all such facts\u00a0 must be accepted\u00a0 by the\u00a0 court as\u00a0 proved;\u00a0 but\u00a0 this\u00a0 theory is without foundation, in the present case, since the defendant expressly denied all\u00a0 the facts alleged\u00a0 in\u00a0 the complaint: \"And answering the\u00a0 said complaint.\"\u00a0 read on page\u00a0 8 of the bill\u00a0 of exceptions, \"they\u00a0 deny each and all of the allegations thereof\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\"\u00a0 (they,\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendants Tabliga and Juan Villa\u00a0 Agustin).<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff averred\u00a0 that he was not contradicted\u00a0 by the evidence in statement of the. amount which the property ought to\u00a0 have produced, and he cited section 126 of the code aforementioned.\u00a0\u00a0 What\u00a0 this section\u00a0 d say is that if there\u00a0 is\u00a0 no answer offered to the\u00a0 complaint, the relief granted to the plaintiff can not exceed that which he shall have demanded in his complaint; but in this suit there was\u00a0 an\u00a0 answer to the\u00a0 complaint the\u00a0 trial was not prosecuted with the defendants in default.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the second assignment of\u00a0 error, the law provides that th redemptioner may,\u00a0 within twelve months from\u00a0 the date\u00a0 of the purchase, redeem the\u00a0 property\u00a0 sold, on paying the purchaser the amount of his purchase,\u00a0 with 1\u00a0 per cent per month\u00a0 interest thereon in addition, up time of redemption.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Sec.\u00a0 465, Code of Civil Procedure.) The judge divided this time\u00a0 into two periods: one, in which the plaintiff\u00a0 offered redemption\u00a0 price,\u00a0 and the other, that\u00a0 following\u00a0 this offer.\u00a0 He\u00a0 fix per cent per month up to the\u00a0 time of the offer, and\u00a0 6\u00a0 per cent per annum thereafter.<br\/><br\/>The following conclusions of the judgment appealed from serve\u00a0 to\u00a0 illus this\u00a0 point:\u00a0 In 1904 a judgment\u00a0 was rendered by the justice of the pea court of Tarlac, against Tomas Arenas and Esteban\u00a0 Fabros.\u00a0\u00a0 On April\u00a0 6 1906, the deputy sheriff of Tarlac proceeded\u00a0 to sell the\u00a0 lands of Este Fabros and Tomas Arenas.\u00a0\u00a0 The land of Tomas Arenas was\u00a0 sold\u00a0 to Juan Tabliga for P120.\u00a0 On March 23, 1907, Esteban Fabros went to the house of Juan Tabliga and asked the\u00a0 latter to allow him\u00a0 to redeem\u00a0 the land of Tomas Arenas, which land was mortgaged to him, Fabros; but Tabliga\u00a0 replied that he\u00a0 would allow\u00a0 him to\u00a0 redeem his own land but n that which was sold\u00a0 as belonging to Tomas Arenas.\u00a0 This petition, the judge adds, was made, as may he\u00a0 observed, within\u00a0 the\u00a0 period of\u00a0 one year, as prescribed by law.\u00a0\u00a0 Esteban Fabros, on a subsequent date, but before\u00a0 the expiration\u00a0 of the twelve months, again went to Tabliga's house,\u00a0 accompanied by the\u00a0 provincial sheriff, Santiago\u00a0 de Jesus,\u00a0 and asked that he be allowed to redeem the\u00a0 land\u00a0 referred to, but on this occasion\u00a0 also the redemption was\u00a0 refused by Tabliga.\u00a0 (B. of e., pp. 1 and\u00a0 11.)<br\/><br\/>The legal grounds\u00a0 of the judgment\u00a0 appealed from are: (1)\u00a0 That, in conformity with\u00a0 section 464 of Act No. 190, a judgment debtor, or his successors in interest,\u00a0 may redeem the property sold,\u00a0 as may also a or having a lien\u00a0 by attachment, judgment\u00a0 or mortgage;\u00a0 so that while Fabros was in possession\u00a0 of the land by reason of a mortgage or whatever\u00a0 the lien was that arose from the credit which\u00a0 he held\u00a0 against Arenas,\u00a0 and latter not having exercised\u00a0 the right of redemption, the\u00a0 right pertain Fabros as the creditor of\u00a0 Arenas;\u00a0 and,\u00a0 (2) that the plaintiff Fabros offered to return to\u00a0 the defendant\u00a0 the sum which\u00a0 the latter had paid the purchase, together with the interest and costs; that, not knowing th amount thereof, he took with him P150 for this purpose \"and offered to count out the amount in the <i>presidencia,<\/i> but the defendant Juan Tabliga refused to allow the redemption of the land which was sold as belonging to Tomas Arenas.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (B.\u00a0 of e.,\u00a0 pp. 12\u00a0 and 13.)<br\/><br\/>The trial court, in its judgment aforementioned, imposed upon the plaint obligation to pay \"the interest at\u00a0 12 per cent per annum until the time the said plaintiff offered to redeem\u00a0 the land, and interest at 6 per cent from the date\u00a0 of the said offer of redemption.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (B. of e., p. 13.) We esteem the second assignment\u00a0 of error\u00a0 to be well founded, that is, the relative to the plaintiff's having to pay an annual interest of 6 per cent besides\u00a0 the 12 per cent\u00a0 which he was\u00a0 willing to pay up to\u00a0 the time o the redemption.\u00a0 In the case of Martinez <i> vs.<\/i>\u00a0 Campbell (10 Phil. 626)\u00a0 this court\u00a0 ruled:<br\/><blockquote> \"When the right of redemption\u00a0 is exercised\u00a0 within the term fixed\u00a0 by s 465 of the Code of\u00a0 Civil\u00a0 Procedure, and an offer is made of the amount due for the\u00a0 repurchase of the property to which said right\u00a0 refers,\u00a0 it neither reasonable\u00a0 nor just that the re-purchaser should pay interest on redemption money after the time when\u00a0 he offered to repurchase and tendered the money therefor.\" <\/blockquote>Moreover, it is a provision of the Civil Code\u00a0 that if the creditor\u00a0 to the\u00a0 tender of payment has been\u00a0 made should refuse to accept it without reason,\u00a0 the debtor shall remain released from all liability by judicial (<i>consignacion<\/i>)\u00a0 of the thing due.\u00a0\u00a0 (Art. 1176.)\u00a0 And\u00a0 the deposit properly made \"by depositing the things due\u00a0 at the disposal of\u00a0 the judicial authority (in the\u00a0 procedure now\u00a0 in force, the sheriff is also included before whom\u00a0 the tender shall be proven in a proper case and the notice of the consignation in other cases.\"\u00a0 (Art. 1178.)\u00a0 There is no reason f other interest, which appears\u00a0 to be a penalty for delinquency, while there was no delinquency.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, in so far as\u00a0 it directs the payment of legal\u00a0 interest\u00a0 at 12 per cent, per annum up\u00a0 to the time when the\u00a0 plaintiff Offered to make the\u00a0 redemption, and it is reversed, in s as it provides that the plaintiff shall pay 6 per cent per annum from the date of the said offer of redemption.\u00a0 No special finding as to costs is made in this instance.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Moreland,<\/i> and <i>Trent, JJ<\/i>., concur. <\/div>",

Jenkins presiding, convicting the defendants of the crime of arson and sentencing each one of them to ten years and one day of <i>presidio mayor,<\/i> with the accessory\u00a0 penalties prescribed in article\u00a0 57 of the\u00a0 Penal Code,\u00a0 to pay one-half the costs and to indemnify, jointly and severally, the Manila Cockpit Company\u00a0 in the sum of P80.<br\/><br\/>On the 6th day of August, 1909, there were two cockpits, one old and the other newly erected,\u00a0 situated in the municipality of\u00a0 Caloocan, Province of Rizal, but within the police limits of the city of Manila.\u00a0\u00a0 Between 9.30 and\u00a0 10 o'clock of the night of that day the\u00a0 new cockpit\u00a0 was feloniously set on fire.<br\/><br\/>The witness Bartolome Buenaventura testified that he knew both of the accused, Juan\u00a0 Lipia being his uncle, and that he had known them since he was a boy; that he knew the cockpits in question and their location; that on\u00a0 the 4th of August he\u00a0 was\u00a0 planting rice when Ceferino Benitez came and called him;\u00a0 that Ceferino Benitez asked him to go along with him to burn the new cockpit; that the witness replied that he was\u00a0 not disposed to go because he had his own business to attend to; that the\u00a0 next day, the 5th, the witness went over to\u00a0 Ceferino's house to get\u00a0 a bolo that he had bought from him, when Ceferino again spoke to him\u00a0 about burning the new cockpit; that the witness still objected and told him that he did not want to go with him; that on the 6th Ceferino waited for the witness on a certain road and\u00a0 spoke to him again, saying that he wanted him to go with him to\u00a0 burn the\u00a0 new cockpit that night; that the witness still refused to go because,\u00a0 as he alleged, it was not right, in the first place, and,\u00a0 in the\u00a0 second place, he was afraid of\u00a0 the owners of the new cockpit; that after being threatened by Ceferino he finally consented to go\u00a0 with him; that Ceferino also told him that he would be well paid for it'; that on asking him how much they were to receive, he replied P500; that the witness asked, who is going to pay that sum,\u00a0 and\u00a0 he replied,\u00a0 Pedro\u00a0 Casimiro;\u00a0 that he went with them on the evening of the 6th; that prior to their going they agreed how the cockpit was to be burned; that they arrived at the cockpit between 9.30 and 10.30 o'clock; that the witness told the accused that it would be better to wait until they had the money before they burned the cock- pit; that they replied that as soon as the cockpit started to burn there would be some one who would get the money from Juana, a widow, who was a shareholder in the cockpit; that the arrangement was to pour petroleum on the cockpit; that the two accused were to\u00a0 go on one side of the cockpit and the witness\u00a0 on the other;\u00a0 that the two accused carried a bottle of petroleum with them as, according to the plan, these two were to set fire to the same side of the cockpit; that they both carried\u00a0 matches;\u00a0 that\u00a0 they\u00a0 arrived at the outside of the fence of the cockpit and the witness told them that they should take one side and he would take the other,\u00a0 so\u00a0 that the fire\u00a0 could\u00a0 be started in two different places\u00a0 at\u00a0 once;\u00a0 that the two accused broke through the fence and threw the petroleum on the cockpit and touched a match to the oil that\u00a0 was running down; that\u00a0 when the fire was started by\u00a0 the accused\u00a0 the\u00a0 witness\u00a0 had not yet broken through\u00a0 the fence on\u00a0 his side; that, seeing the fire burning brightly, he took\u00a0 fear and ran away;\u00a0 that\u00a0 their agreement was to meet at the house\u00a0 of Ceferino the next morning; that the cockpit was only partly destroyed; that he met the accused the next morning and asked them about the money they\u00a0 were to get for burning the cockpit; that the accused told\u00a0 him\u00a0 that they received only P20; that they showed him the money; that they gave him P10; that the witness later tried to get more money from the accused but did not succeed.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 witness Alejandro Nagua testified that he was acquainted with Ceferino\u00a0 Benitez and Juan\u00a0 Lipia, and had known them for some years prior to the 6th\u00a0 day of August, the date on which the cockpit in question was set on fire; that on the night of the said 6th of August he was out in the fields catching snipe; that\u00a0 he had as\u00a0 his companion Ambrosio Alipio; that he was\u00a0 hunting\u00a0 near where the cockpit was located; that the witness suddenly saw a light at\u00a0 the cockpit and after observing a\u00a0 moment and noting that it was on fire, he\u00a0 and his companion hurried toward the place; that when they arrived\u00a0 near the\u00a0 building they saw Ceferino Benitez and Juan Lipia going in the direction of Masambong, running.<br\/><br\/>The testimony of the last\u00a0 witness\u00a0 was corroborated\u00a0 by Ambrosio Alipio, his companion.<br\/><br\/>Juan\u00a0 Alipio testified\u00a0 that\u00a0 he was the caretaker of the cockpit on the night it\u00a0 was burnt and\u00a0 had been such for some time\u00a0 prior thereto; that he\u00a0 was\u00a0 awakened\u00a0 in the nighttime by the fire; that there was\u00a0 no lamp or other fire in or around the cockpit\u00a0 during\u00a0 that\u00a0 night; that the following morning they found the fence broken through and a petroleum bottle with shoestrings\u00a0 tied about it; that six stakes were pulled off the fence near the place where the fire was\u00a0 ignited and two near the\u00a0 water-closet.<br\/><br\/>Anastasia\u00a0\u00a0 Martin,\u00a0 wife\u00a0 of Bartolome Buenaventura, testified that the accused Ceferino\u00a0 Benitez had told her that if\u00a0 her husband Bartolome would turn\u00a0 his back on\u00a0 that matter\u00a0 of the fire,\u00a0 Pedro\u00a0 Casimiro would pay him any amount he wanted;\u00a0 that she told her husband what Ceferino had said.<br\/><br\/>Lucio de Guzman, a witness for the\u00a0 prosecution, testified that he was a resident of the\u00a0 barrio of Balintawak, municipality of Caloocan,\u00a0 and by occupation a farmer; that he had known\u00a0 Juan\u00a0 Lipia and\u00a0 Ceferino\u00a0 Benitez\u00a0 since\u00a0 his boyhood;\u00a0 that before the fire\u00a0 he\u00a0 had\u00a0 a\u00a0 conversation with Ceferino Benitez\u00a0 in the presence of Jua.n Lipia; that\u00a0 they asked him to go with\u00a0 them to assist them\u00a0 in burning the cockpit and stated to him that they would\u00a0 get P500;\u00a0 that later they again invited him to assist them; that the witness declined to implicate himself in the crime.<br\/><br\/>On cross-examination\u00a0 this witness testified that he had been arrested for taking part in what he called the revolt of 1903 and sentenced to five years in Bilibid;\u00a0 and that the charge against him was\u00a0 <i>bandolerismo.<\/i><br\/><br\/>In his opinion, forming the basis of his judgment of\u00a0 conviction, the learned trial court says:<br\/><blockquote>\"Eight or nine apparently credible witnesses testified for the prosecution.\u00a0\u00a0 Their evidence fully\u00a0 and\u00a0 indubitably establishes the guilt of the two accused substantially as alleged.\u00a0 The court is\u00a0 satisfied\u00a0 to\u00a0 a reasonable\u00a0 certainty and\u00a0 beyond a reasonable doubt\u00a0 that the two accused are guilty substantially as\u00a0 alleged in the information and the court so finds.<br\/><br\/>\"If the two witnesses who swore positively that on the night of the 6th of August, 1909, they were out snipe hunting,\u00a0 and saw the\u00a0 two accused coming from the direction of the cockpit alleged to have been fired by the accused, stated the\u00a0 truth,\u00a0 then the alleged\u00a0 defense falls to\u00a0 the ground, independent of the testimony of\u00a0 the several other credible witnesses for\u00a0 the\u00a0 prosecution.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 court\u00a0 gives entire credence to the testimony of\u00a0 these two witnesses,\u00a0 the snipe hunters, and there was nothing in their demeanor or that of any other witness for the prosecution\u00a0 that indicates in any\u00a0 way that they were on the stand to tell anything but the truth.\u00a0 There are no indicia that they or either of them had\u00a0 any motive\u00a0\u00a0 whatever to swear falsely\u00a0 against\u00a0 the accused.\"<\/blockquote>In a\u00a0 conflict of testimony\u00a0 such as is presented\u00a0 in this case, this court must depend to a considerable extent upon the\u00a0 discernment\u00a0 of the judge who sits\u00a0 at the\u00a0 trial.\u00a0 A careful\u00a0 and discriminating trial\u00a0 judge\u00a0 has unequaled advantages in determining the relative credibility of opposing witnesses.\u00a0 If he exercises his faculties with shrewdness and\u00a0 sagacity, he\u00a0 performs a most\u00a0 valuable work for the appellate court.\u00a0\u00a0 We have considered this case in\u00a0 a\u00a0 very painstaking manner.\u00a0 We have searched the record for any evidence indicating that the learned trial court was mistaken in his judgment\u00a0 as to\u00a0 the relative\u00a0 credibility of the witnesses or that he\u00a0 had overlooked\u00a0 some fact or circumstance of weight or influence in passing\u00a0 upon the evidence, or that he had misinterpreted the significance of the facts as proved. We\u00a0 have been unable\u00a0 to\u00a0 find from\u00a0 the record\u00a0 that\u00a0 the learned trial court has\u00a0 fallen into such error; and, in accordance with the rule\u00a0 which we have so often laid down, namely, that this\u00a0 court will not interfere with the judgment of the trial court in passing upon\u00a0 the\u00a0 relative credibility of opposing\u00a0 witnesses\u00a0 unless\u00a0 there\u00a0 appears in the record some fact or circumstance of weight\u00a0 and influence which has\u00a0 been overlooked or its\u00a0 significance\u00a0 misinterpreted\u00a0 by him, we decline to interfere with the judgment of the trial court upon the facts in this case.<br\/><br\/>The penalty in this\u00a0 case is extremely severe.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 injury done to the building\u00a0 was no more than P80.\u00a0\u00a0 It was not a\u00a0 dwelling\u00a0 house,\u00a0 although a family\u00a0 happened to\u00a0 be living\u00a0 in it at the time.\u00a0 It\u00a0 is unmistakable, however, that the crime committed falls within the\u00a0 provisions of article 550, subdivision\u00a0 2, and article\u00a0 551, subdivision\u00a0 1, Penal Code, and these\u00a0 articles fix for said crime the penalty\u00a0 of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">presidio\u00a0 mayor.<\/span>\u00a0\u00a0 There being\u00a0 present\u00a0 the aggravating circumstance of nocturnity and no extenuating circumstance, the penalty must be imposed in the maximum degree.<br\/><br\/>The penalty imposed by\u00a0 the learned trial\u00a0 court being within the law and the facts\u00a0 fully\u00a0 substantiating his\u00a0 conclusions, the\u00a0 judgment\u00a0 is\u00a0 affirmed,\u00a0 with costs against the appellants.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

I\u00a0 can deliver\u00a0 them to the <i>insurrectos<\/i> when they reach here and you must all be ready to join the <i>insurrectos <\/i>when\u00a0 they reach\u00a0 Bambang\u00a0 because I am captain of <i>insurrectos,<\/i> and when they come\u00a0 we will kill the Americans Bennett\u00a0 and Scott and the Romanista <i>padre,<\/i>\u00a0 and burn the convent.\u00a0 Do not tell anything of this to the Americans or the <i>insurrectos<\/i> will kill you when they come,'\u00a0 or words to that effect.\u00a0 That on Sunday,\u00a0 the 4th day of September, 1910, between 9 and 10 o'clock, the councilmen\u00a0 of Bambang\u00a0 assembled at the presidencia\u00a0 of said town in obedience to a call or <i>bandillo<\/i> which had been published the previous evening in said town by the defendant. At this meeting there were\u00a0 present the following\u00a0 councilmen : Proceso Sierra, Martin Apno, Marcelino Alvarez, Angel Malonoy,\u00a0 Santiago\u00a0 Corales, and\u00a0 Francisco Pugayan, and President Planas, the accused.\u00a0 And that the\u00a0 accused then told the assembled councilmen that the\u00a0 <i>insurrectos <\/i>had entered Solano, seized the\u00a0 municipal funds,\u00a0 burned the papers,\u00a0 and\u00a0 made\u00a0 prisoners\u00a0 of the Romanista\u00a0 <i>padres.<\/i> 'Prepare your people with\u00a0 arms, bolos, spears, and arrows, and when the <i>insurrectos<\/i>\u00a0 arrive in this town\u00a0 be ready\u00a0 to join them,\u00a0 and then we\u00a0 will kill the Americans Bennett and Scott and the Romanista padre\/ or words to that effect.<br\/><br\/>\"That on the 2d day of September, 1910,\u00a0 in the house of the Councilman Martin\u00a0 Apno,\u00a0 of the town of Bambang, Nueva\u00a0 Vizcaya, the accused had a conversation with the aforementioned\u00a0 Councilman Martin Apno in which the accused said 'Do you know what has happened in Solano? The <i>insurrectos<\/i>\u00a0 have\u00a0 entered there and taken the money and burned the\u00a0 papers,' and that said\u00a0 Councilman Apno must prepare bolos, lances, and other arms and when the <i>insurrectos <\/i>entered be\u00a0 prepared\u00a0 to join\u00a0 them and that after that they would kill Mr.\u00a0 Bennett and Mr. Scott and the Roman <i>padre<\/i> of the\u00a0 town of Bambang, Nueva Vizcaya.<br\/><br\/>\"These\u00a0 facts\u00a0 were\u00a0 conclusively\u00a0 and\u00a0 overwhelmingly proven by the testimony of the prosecution which consisted of the evidence of four policemen of the town of Bambang, Pantaleon Pugayan,\u00a0 Pedro Sierra,\u00a0 Santiago Angala, and Emeterio\u00a0 Marquez; three councilmen\u00a0 of said town whose names were Proceso Sierra, Martin Apno, and Angel Malanoy, and\u00a0 the municipal treasurer of Bambang, Ventura Bernal, and his clerk Martiniano Miralles.\u00a0\u00a0 The policemen testified that they\u00a0 assembled, four in number, at\u00a0 about 4 o'clock in\u00a0 the afternoon\u00a0 in the\u00a0 <i>presidencia <\/i> of Bambang\u00a0 by order of the defendant on the 3d of September, 1910, and that the defendant then\u00a0 told them to deliver their\u00a0 arms to his house as he, the defendant, was a captain of insurrectos and that he (the defendant) would\u00a0 deliver said arms to the insurrectos when they entered the town of Bambang.\u00a0 The defendant also told the four policemen that the <i>insurrectos<\/i> had already entered Solano, seized the municipal funds and burned the papers, and\u00a0 that when they\u00a0 (the <i>insurrectos<\/i>) reached Bambang to be\u00a0 ready to join them and that they would then kill the two Americans, Bennett and Scott, and the Roman padre and\u00a0 burn the convent.\u00a0 On the next day, the 4th of September, when six councilmen assembled\u00a0 in the presidencia of\u00a0 Bambang in obedience to his order the defendant repeated substantially the same\u00a0 conversation\u00a0 as he\u00a0 had with the policemen.\u00a0 He\u00a0 told the councilmen\u00a0 to prepare their people with arms of all kinds, bolos, lances, and arrows, and be ready to join the insurrectos when they reached Bambang, after which they (the insurrectos) would kill the Americans Scott and Bennett, and the Romanista <i>padre<\/i>, and burn the convent.\u00a0 He also told the councilmen that the <i>insurrectos<\/i> had already entered Solano, seized the municipal funds and\u00a0 burned\u00a0 the papers, and that when they\u00a0 (the <i>insurrectos<\/i>) entered Bambang, they, the councilmen and their people, would hear the salvos of the police at the\u00a0 presidencia and\u00a0 this would\u00a0 be the signal to join forces with the\u00a0 <i>insurrectos<\/i>.\"<\/blockquote>After a careful reading of the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause and brought to this court, we are of the opinion that the findings\u00a0 of fact made by the lower court are in accordance with such evidence, and show that the defendant was guilty of the crime charged beyond per-adventure of\u00a0 doubt, and that the sentence imposed by the lower court is in\u00a0 accordance with\u00a0 the law.\u00a0\u00a0 (Sec, 7,\u00a0 Act No. 292.)\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 sentence of the lower court\u00a0 is, therefore, hereby\u00a0 affirmed with costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

All advances made under sections\u00a0 (1) and (3)\u00a0 shall bear interest at 10 per cent a year, counting from a month after the making thereof, until liquidated by the sale of the goods shipped or by remittance of the amount thereof.<\/p><p>\"5.

Later, and in the month of February, 1909, the plaintiffs sent to the said Collantes, as agent for the\u00a0 defendant, 218 bundles of tobacco in\u00a0 the leaf to be sold on\u00a0 commission, as had\u00a0 been other\u00a0 produce\u00a0 previously.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 said Collantes received\u00a0 said tobacco and sold it for the sum of P1,744. The charges for such sale were P206.96, leaving in the hands of said Collantes the sum of P1,537.08 belonging to the plaintiffs.\u00a0 This sum was, apparently, converted to his own use by said agent.<\/p><p>It appears, however, that prior to the sending of said tobacco the\u00a0 defendant had severed his relations with Collantes and that the latter was no longer acting as his factor. This fact was not known to the plaintiffs;\u00a0 and it\u00a0 is conceded in\u00a0 the case that no notice\u00a0 of any kind was given by the defendant to the\u00a0 plaintiffs of the termination\u00a0 of the relations between the defendant and his agent.\u00a0 The defendant refused to pay the said sum upon demand of the plaintiffs, placing such refusal upon the ground that at the time the said tobacco was received and sold by Collantes he was acting personally and not as agent\u00a0 of the defendant. This action was brought to recover said sum.<\/p><p>As is seen, the only question for our decision is whether or not the plaintiffs,\u00a0 acting in good faith and without knowledge, having sent produce to sell on commission to the former agent of the defendant, can recover of the defendant under the circumstances\u00a0 above\u00a0 set\u00a0 forth.\u00a0 We are of the opinion that the defendant is liable.\u00a0 Having advertised the fact that Collantes was his agent and having given special notice to the plaintiffs of\u00a0 that fact, and having given them a\u00a0 special invitation to\u00a0 deal with such agent, it was the duty of the defendant on the termination of the relationship of principal and agent to give due and timely notice thereof to the plaintiffs.\u00a0 Failing\u00a0 to do so, he is responsible to them for whatever goods may have been in good faith and without negligence sent to the agent without knowledge,\u00a0 actual or constructive, of the termination of such relationship.<\/p><p>For these reasons the judgment appealed from is affirmed, without special finding as\u00a0 to costs.<\/p><p><em>Torres, Mapa, Johnson,<\/em>\u00a0 and <em>Carson, JJ.<\/em>, concur.<\/p><\/div>",

Upon examination\u00a0 it was found that the rope with\u00a0 which it\u00a0 had been tied the night before had been cut in\u00a0 two and the carabao taken away, the gate to the in closure in which it was tied having been forcibly opened.\u00a0\u00a0 For several days the owner, in company with certain of his neighbors, visited the various barrios in that locality in search of said carabao, but without\u00a0 avail.\u00a0 Same\u00a0 days afterwards and on about the 5th day\u00a0 of June, 1909, Irineo\u00a0 Daquigan and Teofilo Bautista,\u00a0 being in a place a little west of the municipality of San Manuel, Province of Pangasinan,\u00a0 saw the two accused\u00a0 in\u00a0 this case,\u00a0 Mariano Caralipio and Cipriano Fernando, going in the direction of the pueblo of San Manuel, driving the carabao in question, upon which the accused Mariano Caralipio was riding.\u00a0 The two witnesses immediately\u00a0 communicated the fact to\u00a0 Feliciano de\u00a0 la Pasion, and the latter, in company\u00a0 with them, went to\u00a0 the pueblo of San Manuel and there found the carabao in\u00a0 question in\u00a0 the possession of\u00a0 the\u00a0 municipal treasurer.\u00a0 Pasion claimed the\u00a0 carabao,\u00a0 but\u00a0 as Cipriano Fernando, one of the accused, claimed it also, the municipal treasurer, after an investigation relative to the ownership, turned it over to Cipriano\u00a0 Fernando, who, on the 25th of June of the same year,\u00a0 took it to the municipality of Moncada, where it was branded by the authorities, from whom he received the corresponding\u00a0 certificate of ownership.\u00a0 Thereafter Feliciano de la Pasion made complaint\u00a0 to the authorities against\u00a0 the accused, charging them with the theft of his carabao.\u00a0 A preliminary investigation was had before Marciano de Guzman,\u00a0 justice of the peace of Bautista.\u00a0 From such exam- ination the magistrate found that sufficient facts had been proved to\u00a0 demonstrate that a crime had been committed and that there was reasonable ground to believe that the accused had committed the same; whereupon\u00a0 he held them to await the action of the Court of First Instance\u00a0 of the province. Pasion proved his ownership of the young carabao by his own testimpny and by the testimony of several\u00a0 other witnesses, who identified it beyond question.\u00a0 On\u00a0 that trial the said justice of the peace, Marciano de Guzman, who had\u00a0 conducted\u00a0 the preliminary investigation in the case, was\u00a0 presented\u00a0 as\u00a0 a witness.<br\/><br\/>During the progress of that preliminary investigation the said justice, to satisfy himself fully\u00a0 as to who\u00a0 was the real owner\u00a0 of the young\u00a0 carabao, made a\u00a0 very practical test to that end.\u00a0 He\u00a0 required the accused Cipriano Fernando,\u00a0 who\u00a0 claimed\u00a0 that\u00a0 the\u00a0 young carabao belonged to him\u00a0 and that he still\u00a0 owned the mother of it, to bring the alleged mother of the young carabao to his office, where the\u00a0 preliminary investigation was\u00a0 being\u00a0 held.\u00a0 He\u00a0 also required Pasion, the other claimant\u00a0 of the young carabao, to bring to the\u00a0 office of the justice of the peace the caraballa which he claimed was the mother of the young carabao in question.\u00a0 This was\u00a0 done.\u00a0 Under\u00a0 the orders\u00a0 of\u00a0 the justice of the peace, the young carabao was placed at the farther end of an inclosure, and the two <i>caraballas<\/i>, alleged mothers of the young\u00a0 carabao,\u00a0 were driven\u00a0 through an opening in the\u00a0 fence at\u00a0 the\u00a0 other\u00a0 end of\u00a0 the inclosure, the caraballa belonging to the accused walking 15 or 20 feet ahead of the <i>caraballa<\/i> belonging to Pasion.\u00a0\u00a0 The young carabao, upon seeing the two <i>caraballas <\/i>enter the inclosure, run\u00a0 forward to meet them.\u00a0\u00a0 It paid not the slightest attention\u00a0 to\u00a0 the <i>caraballa<\/i>\u00a0 of\u00a0 the accused, which\u00a0 it was the first to meet, but passed it by with utter indifference to meet the <i>caraballa<\/i> of Pasion, which\u00a0 it greeted with\u00a0 the customary\u00a0 salutation which a young carabao gives to its mother, manifesting all the signs which are usually shown by a young for\u00a0 a long lost mother.<br\/><br\/>This\u00a0 witness\u00a0 further stated that he then\u00a0 separated the two\u00a0 <i>caraballas<\/i>\u00a0 from the young\u00a0 carabao,\u00a0 after which he turned the two <i>caraballas<\/i> loose.\u00a0 The <i>caraballa <\/i>of Feliciano de la Pasion immediately began searching for the young carabao, while\u00a0 that of the\u00a0 accused\u00a0 showed\u00a0 itself entirely indifferent to its whereabouts.\u00a0 According to the witnesses Feliciano de\u00a0 la\u00a0 Pasion, Irineo Daquigan,\u00a0 Teofilo\u00a0 Bautista and\u00a0 Vidal\u00a0 del Rosario, these same experiments were tried before\u00a0 the\u00a0 municipal\u00a0 treasurer of San Manuel\u00a0 with substantially the same results.<br\/><br\/>We have not the slightest doubt that the young carabao in dispute in this case is and was the property of Feliciano de la Pasion.\u00a0 This being so, it is equally undoubted that it was\u00a0 feloniously taken from\u00a0 his\u00a0 possession by the accused in this case.\u00a0 It is a point\u00a0 worthy of note that the accused Cipriano\u00a0 Fernando admitted upon\u00a0 cross-examina- tion that he had branded and obtained\u00a0 certificates of property for two young carabaos of\u00a0 substantially the same age as the one in dispute, one in the month\u00a0 of November, 1908, and the other in the month of February,\u00a0 1909, both carabaos of the\u00a0 same <i>caraballa<\/i>\u00a0 which he claimed was the mother of the young carabao\u00a0 in question.\u00a0 As\u00a0 the young\u00a0 carabao in dispute is alleged also to be a calf of the same caraballa of the\u00a0 accused\u00a0 and\u00a0 of substantially the same age as the two\u00a0 young\u00a0 carabaos\u00a0 referred to,\u00a0 it presents the\u00a0 unusual spectacle of seeing a <i>caraballa<\/i> the mother of three carabaos in less\u00a0 than\u00a0 two years.\u00a0 There is nothing\u00a0 whatever in the case which indicates that the testimony of the complainant and\u00a0 his witnesses is false.\u00a0 On the other hand, every circumstance which has been presented in this\u00a0 case indicates that that testimony is true.\u00a0 It is to be wondered why\u00a0 the\u00a0 accused, being a\u00a0 resident of one\u00a0 municipality, in which he had caused to be\u00a0 branded two young carabaos during\u00a0 the\u00a0 prior\u00a0 year\u00a0 and from\u00a0 which\u00a0 he\u00a0 had received certificates of property of the same, should take the carabao in question\u00a0 to another municipality for the\u00a0 same purpose. We are\u00a0 of the opinion that the\u00a0 conclusions of the\u00a0 learned trial court are fully sustained by\u00a0 the proofs.\u00a0\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Jamero, 10 Phil. Rep.,\u00a0 137; U.

Jose Tome\" called the attention of Agbac to this change in the course and Agbac said that\u00a0 the change was made on account of the condition of the wind.\u00a0 About that time Raymundo Ibanez approached Jose Tome and said, \"Keep\u00a0 quiet, we must go to Calatrava and\u00a0 when we arrive there you will then\u00a0 find out what we are going\u00a0 to do.\" When\u00a0 the boat was between\u00a0 the\u00a0 Islands of Maestre\u00a0 de Campo and Mindoro, being a\u00a0 considerable distance from the land, seven armed men appeared on the deck, having come out of the bodega in the stern of the boat.\u00a0\u00a0 Up to this time Jose Tome, did not know these men\u00a0 were\u00a0 aboard.\u00a0\u00a0 Three of these men were Valentin\u00a0 Fonte, Maximo Regencia, and Bartolome Monterey.\u00a0 Maximino Politico, Enrique Laylay, and Ciriaco Ibanez did not accompany the other defendants on this voyage.\u00a0 On the following morning, April 20, they arrived at Sibali and there took water aboard.\u00a0 From that point they continued their course to the barrio of Calatrava, municipality of Odiongan, Island of Tablas, and anchored in a place called Pangoyoc, within the jurisdiction of that barrio. On anchoring at this point Raymundo Ibanez, Tomas\u00a0 Machete, and Aniceto Agbac disembarked and went to the store of Lu-Quinghong, in the barrio of Calatrava, and purchased a certain amount of rice.\u00a0 These three defendants remained in this store for some time and while\u00a0 there\u00a0 carried on a conversation with the wife of Lu-Quinghong.\u00a0 After purchasing the rice they returned to the\u00a0 boat and that same afternoon moved down and anchored just\u00a0 in front of that barrio where they\u00a0 remained until\u00a0 sometime after dark. About 8 p.\u00a0 m. all the men aboard,\u00a0 with the exception of Jose Tome, and an old man called Pedro, disembarked, being armed with bolos, and went to the stores of Lu-Quinghong and\u00a0 Sianga, which were only a few\u00a0 yards\u00a0 from where the boat was anchored.\u00a0 On arriving at these two stores\u00a0 which were only about 3 yards apart, they entered, and by means of force\u00a0 and\u00a0 intimidation\u00a0 took therefrom\u00a0 merchandise, money, and jewelry\u00a0 to the value of more than P3,000\u00a0 and placed same aboard the boat.\u00a0 They also\u00a0 tied the\u00a0 elbows of the Chinaman Sianga behind his back and by means of force took him aboard.\u00a0 They then started on their return trip\u00a0 with the Chinaman and the booty aboard,\u00a0 and when they were a considerable\u00a0 distance from land, so far that the lights\u00a0 on shore could not be seen, Aniceto Agbac directed that the Chinaman Sianga be placed near\u00a0 the edge of\u00a0 the boat.\u00a0 This was done and while the Chinaman was standing in that position, with his elbows still tied behind his back, he was, by order of said Agbac,\u00a0 pushed overboard by Bartolome Monterey.\u00a0 Siaflga\u00a0 has never since been heard of. The\u00a0 defendants continued\u00a0 their journey, arriving\u00a0 at\u00a0 the place whence they sailed the following day, and after disembarking they divided the effects and disbanded.\u00a0\u00a0 In\u00a0 the division of these effects Ciriaco received his share.\u00a0\u00a0 These goods, found in the possession of Ciriaco when he was arrested, were identified by the owners as part of the\u00a0 goods taken from their stores on the night of April 23d.\u00a0 Likewise the goods found in the possession of Enrique Laylay and Maximino Politico were also identified in the same manner. These facts have not only been\u00a0 established by the direct and positive testimony of Felix Tome, Jose Tome, Lu-Quinghong,\u00a0 his wife Eustaquia Farconer, Teresa Paulina, wife of Siafiga, Marcos Bindol, and the officers who found a part of\u00a0 the goods in the possession\u00a0 of\u00a0 Ciriaco,\u00a0 Enrique\u00a0 and Maximino, but also\u00a0 by\u00a0 the\u00a0 free\u00a0 and voluntary confession of Bartolome Monterey who admitted that it\u00a0 was he who pushed the Chinaman\u00a0 overboard.\u00a0 In this confession\u00a0 he sought to escape responsibility by stating that he was ordered to do this by his chief, Aniceto Agbac.<br\/><br\/>Enrique Laylay and\u00a0 Maximino Politico took no part in the commission of this\u00a0 crime, but a part of the goods, as we have said, were found in their\u00a0 possession.\u00a0 They attempted to explain how they came into the possession of these goods by saying that they had purchased them from certain traveling Macabebe salesmen.\u00a0\u00a0 This explanation was properly found by the\u00a0 court below to be entirely unsatisfactory.\u00a0 These\u00a0 two accused are day laborers,\u00a0 receiving small wages.\u00a0 They have several members in their families dependent upon them.\u00a0\u00a0 They lived in the same locality with the other defendants and were all known to\u00a0 each\u00a0 other. These goods had been, according to their own testimony, in their possession for quite a while without having been used or even made into clothing.<br\/><br\/>The first question for\u00a0 determination is whether or not the above facts constitute the crime of<i> bandolerismo,<\/i> as defined and punished by Act No. 518, as amended by Act No. 1121. The first section of said\u00a0 Act, as amended, provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"Whenever three or\u00a0 more persons, conspiring together, shall form a band of robbers for the purpose of stealing carabaos, cattle, horses, rice, or personal property of any description, or for the purpose of abducting persons,\u00a0 either for the purpose of extortion or obtaining ransom, or for any other purpose, by means of force and violence, and shall be armed with deadly weapons for this purpose, they shall be deemed highway robbers,\u00a0 or brigands.\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>\"To prove the crime described in the previous section, it shall not be necessary to adduce evidence that any member of the band has in fact committed robbery or theft or abduction, but it shall\u00a0 be sufficient to justify a\u00a0 conviction thereunder\u00a0 if,\u00a0 from all\u00a0 the\u00a0 evidence, it\u00a0 can be inferred beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was a member of such armed band as that described in said section.\"\u00a0 (Section 2.)<\/blockquote>At the time these provisions were\u00a0 enacted there were in force\u00a0 statutes\u00a0 defining and\u00a0 penalizing robbery in\u00a0 band, robbery with homicide, abduction, etc.\u00a0 In fact every kind of robbery was defined and punished in those statutes (Penal Code) but there was no law punishing or making it a crime to form bands for the purpose of committing robbery, larceny,\u00a0 or abduction.\u00a0\u00a0 At the time Act No.\u00a0 518 was passed some\u00a0 sections of the country were\u00a0 infested with\u00a0 roving bands of outlaws.\u00a0 The articles\u00a0 of\u00a0 the Penal Code were considered\u00a0 insufficient to meet the existing conditions and to adequately punish members of such bands.<br\/><blockquote>\"It will be seen at a glance that the main object in enacting this law (Act No. 518)\u00a0 was\u00a0 to prevent the formation of such bands; in fact the heart\u00a0 of the offense consists in the formation by three or more persons conspiring together for the purpose of theft\u00a0 or\u00a0 robbery, and\u00a0 such\u00a0 formation is sufficient to constitute a violation of this Act.\u00a0 It would not be necessary to show, in\u00a0 a prosecution\u00a0 under it, that a member or members of the band actually committed theft or highway robbery in order to convict him or\u00a0 them; for the crime is proved when the organization and purpose of the band is shown to be such as is prohibited by the statute.\" (U. S. <i>vs. <\/i>Decusin, 2 Phil. Rep., 536.)<br\/><\/blockquote>In the case at bar\u00a0 the first move made was\u00a0 the hiring of the vessel by Ciriaco Ibaiiez; then followed the journey or voyage which was made almost direct\u00a0 to the barrio of Calatrava,\u00a0 where the robbery was committed.\u00a0 Only one stop was made on the way and that for the purpose of taking on water.\u00a0 No\u00a0 attempt was made at this\u00a0 place\u00a0 to commit any depredations.\u00a0 On arrival at the said\u00a0 barrio of Calatrava three of the defendants went\u00a0 ashore and\u00a0 purchased rice and then returned to the\u00a0 boat where they spent several hours without molesting anyone.\u00a0 About 8 o'clock that night they disembarked and went direct to the two stores of the offended parties, which were\u00a0 almost together.\u00a0 The band then divided\u00a0 and robbed the said stores at the\u00a0 same time, and after the completion of this robbery they returned to the boat with their booty and the Chinaman Sianga.\u00a0 They did not attempt to molest anyone\u00a0 else in that barrio.\u00a0 The robbery of these two stores constituted one continuous act - robbery.\u00a0 These men\u00a0 were sufficient in number and sufficiently well armed to have committed other robberies and abuses if they had so\u00a0 desired. They left this\u00a0 barrio and went directly home, divided the effects, and then disbanded. They committed no other robberies or thefts.\u00a0 From all the facts and circumstances in the case it appears that when they left their homes they had in mind to\u00a0 rob these two stores and no others.\u00a0\u00a0 Their subsequent acts show this to be true.<br\/><blockquote>\"Whenever three or more persons, conspiring together, shall form a\u00a0 band\u00a0 of robbers for\u00a0 the purpose of\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 * and\u00a0 shall be armed with\u00a0 deadly weapons\u00a0 for this purpose, they shall be deemed highway robbers, or brigands, *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.\"\u00a0 [Sec. 1, Act No. 1121.]<br\/><\/blockquote>The defendants were more than three in number.\u00a0 They were armed with deadly weapons (bolos); they left their homes and went together\u00a0 (except Ciriaco Ibanez,\u00a0 Laylay, and Politico) to the barrio of Calatrava\u00a0 and there committed the robbery.\u00a0 From these facts it may\u00a0 reasonably and lawfully\u00a0 be inferred that they conspired together\u00a0 for the purpose of committing\u00a0 said robbery; but\u00a0 may it,\u00a0 in addition, be inferred that they also conspired together to form a\u00a0 band\u00a0 of highway robbers or brigands?\u00a0\u00a0 We think not.\u00a0 The words \"highway\u00a0 robbers\" and \"brigands^\u00a0 are synonymous..\u00a0 A brigand is defined by Webster as being \"A lawless\u00a0 fellow who lives by plunder; one of a gang living in mountain\u00a0 retreats; a highwayman;\u00a0 a\u00a0 freebooter.\"\u00a0\u00a0 A band organized for the purpose of committing depredations and disturbing organized society by disregarding the laws of the land and the rights of the\u00a0 people,\u00a0 something more than a mere robber.\u00a0 We, therefore, conclude that the facts in this case do not constitute the crime of <i>bandolerismo.<br\/><\/i><br\/>The fiscal characterizes this crime as that of <i>bandolerismo<\/i> with murder.\u00a0 The allegations in\u00a0 the complaint are sufficient to constitute this offense, but the facts established are not.\u00a0 It\u00a0 is\u00a0 alleged in the\u00a0 complaint, among other things, that the defendants,\u00a0 being armed with bolos, did, on\u00a0 the night of the 23d of\u00a0 April, 1909,\u00a0 by means of force and violence, appropriate jewelry, money and other effects to the value of P3,000; that after tying the Chinaman Siaiiga they took\u00a0 him,\u00a0 with\u00a0 the effects appropriated, aboard\u00a0 the boat; and that after so doing they did, intentionally, maliciously, treacherously, and\u00a0 with known premeditation, push the said Chinaman into the sea.\u00a0\u00a0 These were the specific allegations the defendants were called upon to answer.\u00a0 They denied having committed these acts.\u00a0 As to Whether or not they did actually commit these acts was the real issue between the\u00a0 prosecution and the defense.\u00a0 The characterization of the crime was of no\u00a0 importance to them.\u00a0\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Lim San, 17 Phil. Rep., 278.)\u00a0\u00a0 The above allegations are sufficient to constitute the complex crime\u00a0 of robbery with homicide.\u00a0 This was\u00a0 the real crime for the commission of which the defendants were tried.\u00a0 The prosecution confined itself to these facts and the defense denied\u00a0 and sought to show that\u00a0 the defendants did not commit these\u00a0 specified acts.<br\/><br\/>It is, however, insisted that the crime of robbery with homicide has not been established, for the reason that\u00a0 the prosecution failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the Chinaman Siaiiga was, in\u00a0 fact, killed by the defendants on the night of April\u00a0 23.\u00a0 Counsel\u00a0 argues\u00a0 that\u00a0 the said Chinaman\u00a0 might have\u00a0 swum ashore, or could have been picked up or rescued\u00a0 by someone passing in a boat;\u00a0 or, in other words, that the <i>corpus delicti<\/i> has not been established. It is true that a conviction\u00a0 can not be entered until the fact that the crime has been actually perpetrated has been first proven.\u00a0 The defendants can not be convicted of this crime, unless the death of the Chinaman be first distinctly proved, either by direct evidence of the fact or by inspection of the\u00a0 body.\u00a0\u00a0 The body has never been seen or inspected. But can there be any doubt as to whether or not the Chinaman was actually killed on\u00a0 that night? We think there can\u00a0 be none.\u00a0 His arms were securely tied, hard and fast, behind his back.\u00a0 He was thrown into the sea in this condition at a place far out of sight of land and the\u00a0 lights on shore, and upon a dark night.\u00a0 When he struck the water in this condition he\u00a0 was perfectly helpless, as far as he himself was concerned.\u00a0 He could not use his arms\u00a0 and hands for the purpose of swimming, or saving himself, and according to the very nature of things he must and did lose his life.\u00a0\u00a0 The defendants took care that no one was near when the Chinaman was thrown overboard.\u00a0 He could not possibly\u00a0 have lived\u00a0 more than a very few\u00a0 minutes\u00a0 not by any means sufficiently long enough to have afforded an opportunity for anyone to have come to his rescue.\u00a0\u00a0 These facts allow\u00a0 our minds to rest perfectly easy when we say that the Chinaman did, in fact, lose his life on that occasion. No other possible conclusion can be reached.\u00a0\u00a0 The two essential elements in this crime, robbery and the killing of the Chinaman, have been clearly established.<br\/><br\/>The guilt of the defendants, Tomas Machete,\u00a0 Domingo Contreras, Maximo\u00a0 Regencia, Aniceto Agbac, Bartolome Monterey, Raymundo Iba\u00f1ez, and Valentin Fonte\u00a0 (the\u00a0 last two\u00a0 having withdrawn their appeals\u00a0 are not now\u00a0 to be considered)\u00a0 of the commission of this crime, by direct participation, has been shown beyond a reasonable doubt.\u00a0\u00a0 In the commission of this crime there were present the generic aggravating circumstances of alevosia and nocturnity, it having been shown that\u00a0 the defendants took advantage of the darkness of the night to commit\u00a0 this deed, and that the Chinaman was, at the time he was murdered or thrown overboard, tied and\u00a0 in a helpless condition.\u00a0 In the commission of this crime none of the extenuating circumstances set out in article 9 of the Penal Code were present.\u00a0\u00a0 Upon these findings of fact the capital penalty must be imposed, unless in the exercise of the discretion vested in the courts, the extenuating circumstance of race should be taken into consideration in favor of the defendants, under the provisions of article 11 of the Penal Code.\u00a0 The benefit of the provisions of this article can not be extended to Aniceto Agbac and Bartolome Monterey.\u00a0 Agbac was the leader or chief of the gang.\u00a0 He directed to a\u00a0 great extent their movements.\u00a0 He\u00a0 gave the order\u00a0 for\u00a0 the murder of the Chinaman.\u00a0 This order, as given, was carried out by Monterey.\u00a0\u00a0 Monterey offered no objection to the carrying into effect of this order, but, on the contrary, did not hesitate to do so.\u00a0 He was to this extent more active than any other of the members, aside from Agbac.\u00a0\u00a0 It is true that the other defendants, who were\u00a0 in the boat at the time the Chinaman was murdered,\u00a0 made no effort to save him, but they were dominated and controlled by Agbac.\u00a0 They appeared to have been reared in remote barrios and are of an extremely low order of intelligence.\u00a0\u00a0 We think,\u00a0 under all the facts and circumstances that they should be given the benefits of the provisions of article 11 of the Penal Code, thereby reducing the penalty from death to life imprisonment.\u00a0\u00a0 (U.

He had been in this barrio just a short time before and knew the Chinamen and their places of business.\u00a0\u00a0 It must be inferred from all these facts and circumstances that he entered into an agreement or conspiracy with the other defendants (not including Enrique Laylay and\u00a0 Maximino Politico)\u00a0 to commit this\u00a0 robbery.\u00a0\u00a0 By so doing, and\u00a0 having received a\u00a0 part of the effects taken\u00a0 from the said\u00a0 Chinamen, he became a principal in a consummated crime.\u00a0 There is no other logical\u00a0 conclusion which can be reached.\u00a0 This result is inevitable.\u00a0\u00a0 Now, what is that crime?<br\/><br\/>Title 13, chapter 2, [chapter 1]\u00a0 of the Penal Code, defines and penalizes the crimes of attempted, frustrated, and consummated robbery.\u00a0\u00a0 The first\u00a0 article of this chapter provides :<br\/><blockquote>\"Art.\u00a0 502. Those who, with intent of profiting thereby, shall take possession of the personal property of another, with violence or intimidation of the person\u00a0 or by employing force with regard to the personal property, are guilty of the crime of robbery.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The subsequent articles fix the penalties for the different kinds\u00a0 of robbery.\u00a0\u00a0 These various classes have different penalties, depending upon the\u00a0 attendant circumstances. The basis of all is robbery.\u00a0 All are one and the same crime, the only difference being in the penalties.\u00a0\u00a0 If on account or on the occasion of robbery there results homicide the penalty is fixed at from life imprisonment to\u00a0 death.\u00a0 If the robbery should be accompanied by rape, or any of the injuries mentioned in Nos.'lj) 2, 3, or 4 of article 416 of the Penal Code, still different penalties\u00a0 must be imposed upon the\u00a0 culprit. The same is true all through this chapter, yet all the crimes are those of robbery, except those mentioned\u00a0 in article 506, which\u00a0 are\u00a0 attempted\u00a0 and frustrated\u00a0 crimes\u00a0 of robbery. These different kinds or classes of robbery with their corresponding penalties, are not distinct and separate crimes.<br\/><br\/>The defendants (except Ciriaco Ibanez,\u00a0 Enrique Lay lay, and\u00a0 Maximino Politico)\u00a0 committed the crime of\u00a0 robbery with hjomicide; as defined and punished under articles 502 and 503, No. 1, of the Penal Code.\u00a0 This is one of the classes of robbery defined in said chapter.\u00a0\u00a0 In the commission of this crime or class of robbery there was also committed one of the other classes of robbery, being that defined and penalized\u00a0 under articles 502 and 503, paragraph 5, in\u00a0 relation with article 504 of said\u00a0 chapter, which is known as robbery in band, it having been shown that more than three armed malefactors robbed the\u00a0 two stores belonging to the Chinamen.<br\/><br\/>When Ciriaco\u00a0 Ibanez furnished the\u00a0 transportation\u00a0 for the other defendants, he\u00a0 did so for the purpose of having the said defendants\u00a0 rob these two\u00a0 stores.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 robbery was\u00a0 his principal object.\u00a0 It is true that homicide resulted on the occasion of this robbery, but there is nothing in the record which shows,\u00a0 or tends\u00a0 to show, that Ciriaco gave instructions to kill the Chinaman or intended that this should be done.\u00a0 When the Chinaman was killed\u00a0 the robbery had already been committed, but the killing took place on the occasion of the robbery.\u00a0 The murder was an incident to the robbery,\u00a0 which places the crime, so far as the other accused (excluding Laylay and Politico) are\u00a0 concerned, in a different class.\u00a0\u00a0 Yet under these facts and circumstances Ciriaco\u00a0 can not be held\u00a0 to be a principal in the commission of this\u00a0 crime or\u00a0 class of robbery, but he is a principal in the commission of the other class, robbery in band. There is nothing in\u00a0 the record to show that he planned or conspired to commit the niurder.\u00a0\u00a0 It\u00a0 has been suggested that as he, Ciriaco, entered into an agreement with the other defendants to commit this crime of\u00a0 robbery, he is responsible for all the results of that crime, as he knew that death might be a necessary incident to the carrying into effect of this plan. If the death\u00a0 of the Chinaman had occurred in the\u00a0 very act or at the very time that the robbery took place, or while it was going on, and if it had been necessary to kill the Chinaman in\u00a0 order to\u00a0 successfully rob\u00a0 these stores, then the question might have been different\u00a0 (a question which we do not now decide), but as the actual taking of the property had already terminated, and the death of the Chinaman resulted\u00a0 on the occasion of the robbery, we think,\u00a0 in the absence of proof showing that the murder was a part of the original plan, that the foregoing holding is the\u00a0 correct one.<br\/><br\/>Enrique Laylay and Maximino Politico, as we have said, were not present when the robbery was committed.\u00a0 Neither were they present when the Chinaman was murdered.\u00a0\u00a0 They took no part in the agreement or conspiracy to commit this crime, but they did receive a part of the property or effects taken from the stores.\u00a0 These effects were found in their possession and were identified by the owners.\u00a0\u00a0 These two defendants attempted to show that they had purchased these effects from traveling\u00a0 salesmen (Macabebes).\u00a0 This defense, as we have heretofore said, has utterly failed, as the proofs show that these defendants knowingly and willfully misstated the facts when they\u00a0 swore that they had purchased said effects in that manner.\u00a0 Taking into consideration the\u00a0 fact that these two defendants lived in the same neighborhood or locality with some of the principal actors in this crime, that they are men of very limited means, that they had in their possession a considerable quantity of these effects, much\u00a0 more than they could be\u00a0 expected to have, and also the significant fact\u00a0 of\u00a0 their having attempted to deceive the court as to the manner of acquiring said goods, we think the proofs are amply sufficient to show that these two defendants knew that these effects had been taken from the stores of the Chinamen when they took them into their possession.<br\/><br\/>For these reasons the judgment appealed from is reversed and the defendants are found guilty of the crime set forth in this decision, and Aniceto Agbac and Bartolome Monterey are. each sentenced to be hanged by the neck until dead; Tomas Machete, Domingo Contreras,\u00a0 and Maximo Regehcia are each sentenced to life imprisonment;\u00a0 Ciriaco Ibanez to eight years eleven months and ten days' <i>presidio mayor,<\/i> and Enrique Laylay and Maximino\u00a0 Politico each\u00a0 to pay a fine of\u00a0 500 pesetas, with the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency.\u00a0 These defendants are further sentenced\u00a0 to\u00a0 the\u00a0 accessory\u00a0 penalties provided\u00a0 by law, and each to pay one-tenth of the coats.\u00a0 It is so ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Carson,<\/i> and <i>Moreland,\u00a0 JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><br\/><i>Johnson, J<\/i>., concurs with the dispositive part.<br\/><\/div>",

that it was appraised, for the purpose of the payment of\u00a0 the land tax, at $95 United States currency, and had been acquired\u00a0 by the\u00a0 applicant as a part of his share,\u00a0 pursuant to a mutual agreement with Adriana Salvador with whom he\u00a0 had been living connubially for a long time; that the latter, before the\u00a0 partition was made and\u00a0 while\u00a0 she was still\u00a0 living\u00a0 with the applicant,\u00a0 applied for a possessory information title and inscribed in her name all of the land in the property registry of La Laguna, as the present applicant was then in the military service in the capacity of corporal of the <i>Guardia Civil <\/i>of the Spanish Government; that\u00a0 afterwards\u00a0 Adriana Salvador sold the part that belonged\u00a0 to her to Arcadio Brion, attaching the possessory\u00a0 title to the\u00a0 deed which she\u00a0 executed\u00a0 before the municipal president of San\u00a0 Pablo; that\u00a0 the applicant at present occupies the said land, and that, to his best knowledge and belief, there is'no encumbrance\u00a0 on\u00a0 the same and no other person\u00a0 who\u00a0 might claim to have\u00a0 any right or share therein.<br\/><br\/>The case came up for hearing and as no one appeared to oppose the application of Ruperto Salva,\u00a0 notwithstanding the summons issued and the notices\u00a0 published after the presentation of both oral and documentary evidence by the applicant, the judge of\u00a0 the\u00a0 Court of\u00a0 Land Registration, in view thereof, rendered judgment on December 3, 1908, whereby he found\u00a0 that the adjudication\u00a0 and registration of the\u00a0 said property in the name of the\u00a0 applicant, in accordance with the plan and technical description presented and after\u00a0 the entry\u00a0 of a\u00a0 general default, was admissible, and ordered the issuance of the proper decree in his favor.<br\/><br\/>Three months after the said decree had been\u00a0 issued in behalf of Ruperto Salva, Francisco Faustino, by a petition of March 3, 1900, presented in the\u00a0 name of his wife, Adriana Salvador, requested\u00a0 that, in consideration of the reasons alleged therein, all the proceedings had in the said case at the instance ofRu per to Salva be declared null and void, and that a title of ownership to the land in question be decreed in his favor.\u00a0\u00a0 The said petition further\u00a0 prayed that, in any case, a\u00a0 new trial be held, without prejudice to an investigation by the proper authority of the fraud and deceit practiced\u00a0 by\u00a0 Salva, in order that he might\u00a0 be punished\u00a0 therefor, and recited that the opponent's wife, Adriana Salvajior, was the legitimate owner of the land in question, by possession for more than fifty\u00a0 years, according to the composition title recorded in the property registry on November 14, 1895, which title was attached\u00a0 to\u00a0 his petition; and, further, that, notwithstanding the fact that Salvador resided in the pueblo of Quingua, Bulacan, she exercised, through her agent, Ruperto Salva, her right\u00a0 of possession\u00a0 over\u00a0 the said land; that on December 4, 1907, Adriana Salvador sold one-half of\u00a0 her land to Arcadio Brion, as recorded on the margin of one of the sheets\u00a0 of her title of ownership; that, a few days before, it had come to her knowledge that her said agent, abusing her confidence, had\u00a0 instituted case No. 4534 in the Court of Land\u00a0 Registration, wherein\u00a0 he alleged that the remaining half of the land in question was his and applied for the issuance\u00a0 of a title, willfully concealing the\u00a0 fact that the said land belonged to Adriana Salvador,\u00a0 wherefore the\u00a0 court did not summon the latter; and the petition set forth that thereby the fraud\u00a0 of which\u00a0 Ruperto Salva\u00a0 availed\u00a0 himself, was proved, and that therefore the proceedings\u00a0 should\u00a0 be annulled,\u00a0 with\u00a0 respect\u00a0 to\u00a0 which neither Adriana\u00a0 Salvador nor her husband, Francisco Faustino, had any knowledge, they having learned of the fraud through a statement made to\u00a0 the\u00a0 latter by the superintendent of schools of La Laguna, to the effect that the Government desired to purchase Adriana Salvador's land for the purpose of erecting a school building thereon.<br\/><br\/>A rehearing of the case was had\u00a0 on\u00a0 a motion for a new-trial\u00a0 filed by Adriana Salvador's husband.\u00a0 On September 27, 1909, the judge annulled the decree of registration of December 3, 1908, and ordered a continuance of the hearing of the case in order to decide the question of the ownership of the property alleged to pertain to Adriana Salvador.<br\/><br\/>Upon the further hearing\u00a0 of the case, and\u00a0 after the presentation of oral evidence by the parties, the documents exhibited were attached to the record, the court pronounced judgment on November\u00a0 20,\u00a0 1909,\u00a0 granting\u00a0 the petition presented by Adriana Salvador on the\u00a0 3d of\u00a0 the\u00a0 previous month of March, and ordered the cancellation\u00a0 of the decree No. 5053, issued in favor of Ruperto\u00a0 Salva\u00a0 and\u00a0 referred to in the ruling made on\u00a0 March\u00a0 9, 1909,\u00a0 and\u00a0 that\u00a0 the register of deeds of La Laguna and\u00a0 the clerk\u00a0 of the Court of Land Registration issue another decree of registration of the said\u00a0 property\u00a0 in the name of Adriana Salvador as soon as this\u00a0 judgment should have become final. Ruperto Salva, upon notice of the aforementioned\u00a0 order, filed a written motion for a rehearing,\u00a0 on\u00a0 the ground\u00a0 that the same was contrary to law and was\u00a0 unsupported by the weight\u00a0 of the evidence.\u00a0\u00a0 This motion was denied on December\u00a0 14, 1909, wherefore the applicant Salva took exception to\u00a0 all of the rulings\u00a0 and orders of the court in these proceedings of review and filed\u00a0 the proper bill\u00a0 of exceptions for certification and transmission to the clerk of this court. Section 38 of Act No. 496, among other provisions,\u00a0 contains the following:<br\/><blockquote>\"Every decree\u00a0 of registration shall bind the land,\u00a0 and quiet\u00a0 title thereto,\u00a0 subject\u00a0 only to\u00a0 the exceptions stated in the following section.\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 Such decree shall not be opened by reason of the absence, infancy, or other disability of any person affected thereby, nor by any proceeding in any court for\u00a0 reversing judgments\u00a0 or decrees;\u00a0 subject, however, to the right of any person deprived of land or of any estate\u00a0 or interest therein by\u00a0 decree\u00a0 of registration obtained by fraud to file in\u00a0 the Court of Land Registration a petition\u00a0 for review within one year after entry of the decree, provided no innocent purchaser for value has acquired an interest.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Did Ruperto Salva act fraudulently in applying for the registration of one-half of the land, the possessory title of which had previously been recorded in the property registry in the name of Adriana Salvador, without having expressly requested that the\u00a0 latter be summoned, when the partition of the said\u00a0 land,\u00a0 made\u00a0 between\u00a0 the applicant and\u00a0 the presumed owner of the property, appears only in a private document not duly\u00a0 legalized? <br\/><br\/>The applicant Salva knew perfectly well that the opponent Salvador\u00a0 had applied for the said\u00a0 possessory\u00a0 title with favorable result; that\u00a0 such title\u00a0 set\u00a0 forth that she had acquired all the land referred to, by purchase from Laureana Gabino, and that she had been in possession\u00a0 of the property since its acquisition, inasmuch as\u00a0 he himself had\u00a0 signed in the name of the opponent, because she did not know how to write, a petition of the date of November\u00a0 8, 1895,\u00a0 addressed to the register of property and requesting a certified copy of the title which was entered in the\u00a0 registry, which copy he himself exhibited under letter C, as the assent of the real owner of Jthe entire piece of land was indispensable to obtain\u00a0 a favorable issue\u00a0 of his\u00a0 claim filed before\u00a0 the Court of Land Registration. <br\/><br\/>Neither could the applicant, Ruperto Salva, have been unaware of the fact that when Adriana Salvador sold one-half of the said land\u00a0 to\u00a0 Arcadio Brion, on\u00a0 December 4, 1901, she did so as the owner of the entire property,\u00a0 as stated in the\u00a0 instrument drawn\u00a0 up before\u00a0 the\u00a0 municipal president of San Pablo, Exhibit No. 3, a copy of which,\u00a0 or its original, must have been seen and read by him when in the possession of the vendee, who furnished\u00a0 him\u00a0 the aforesaid certified copy, letter\u00a0 C; therefore he must have understood that\u00a0 the private document, designated under letter B, which accompanied his\u00a0 application and contained the agreement of partition of the said land, claimed by him to have\u00a0 been entered\u00a0 into\u00a0 by himself and\u00a0 Adriana Salvador, could not be authentic nor efficacious except upon approval by the latter, the sole owner of the realty according to the documents aforementioned; and, withal,\u00a0 there being no record\u00a0 of\u00a0 such\u00a0 approval, Ruperto Salva,\u00a0 in\u00a0 applying for the registration of one-half\u00a0 of the land alleged by him to be\u00a0 his, did not request that the said owner of the land be summoned, leaving it to be inferred\u00a0 that\u00a0 the latter had transferred to him\u00a0 the ownership\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 said one-half\u00a0 of the property, when,\u00a0 in\u00a0 reality,\u00a0 there was no authentic record to that effect, and such transfer was afterwards found not to have been made.<br\/><br\/>Ruperto Salva\u00a0 endeavored to prove in these proceedings the certainty and authenticity of the instrument of partition, letter B, by means of the testimony of three witnesses whose sworn statements, in\u00a0 the opinion of the judge, could not destroy the conclusion reached from the evidence\u00a0 adduced at\u00a0 the trial, which conclusion can not\u00a0 be\u00a0 rejected without good reason.<br\/><br\/>Adriana Salvador denied that she had\u00a0 made with the applicant the\u00a0 said agreement\u00a0 of\u00a0 partition of the land in litigation\u00a0 and\u00a0 that they were\u00a0 co-owners of\u00a0 the property. She maintained that the whole of the\u00a0 said land belonged to her and that she had acquired it with her own funds. These positive statements of the opponent\u00a0 appear to be corroborated by the text of the\u00a0 document No. 3, relative to the sale of ore-half of the land m question to\u00a0 Arcadio Brion, for in it\u00a0 the vendor states that\u00a0 she owned all the land, the area and bounds of which are given, and that she sold only one-half\u00a0 of the same to the said vendee,\u00a0 Arcadio Brion. This document, dated December 4, 1901, was not impugned nor refuted as false.<br\/><br\/>Were it true that, on the first of the month just above mentioned, three days before Adriana Salvador had executed the instrument of partition, letter B, Jose Brion, who signed it at the\u00a0 request,\u00a0 according to\u00a0 himself and\u00a0 the\u00a0 applicant, of the said Salvador, on reading and signing the instrument of sale, No. 3, of one-half of the land at the request of or for\u00a0 Matea Lopez,\u00a0 the wife of the\u00a0 vendee, Arcadio Brion, his brother, would have called the Iatter's attention to the fact that\u00a0 the\u00a0 vendor, who on the 1st\u00a0 of December agreed with Ruperto\u00a0 Salva to divide the and\u00a0 with him by deeding him one-half of it, stated on the fourth of the same month, three days afterwards, that she was still the owner of the whole\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 land\u00a0 and that she only sold the half of it. Jose Brion, while\u00a0 interested in behalf of his brother,\u00a0 the purchaser, made no objection and said nothing,\u00a0 undoubtedly because it was not true that there was an\u00a0 agreement of partition,\u00a0 nor\u00a0 that\u00a0 such an\u00a0 instrument was really executed by Adriana Salvador.<br\/><br\/>The latter, according to the marriage certificate, Exhibit No.\u00a0 2, was\u00a0 married to Francisco Faustino on August 26, 1901, and therefore it\u00a0 is to be1 believed that\u00a0 she did not continue to live\u00a0 with her former paramour, Ruperto Salva, on the 1st of December of the same year.<br\/><br\/>It is true that in this document it is stated that she\u00a0 was single, as\u00a0 likewise in the\u00a0 other instrument of sale, Exhibit No. 3, dated the fourth of the same month and year; but the opponent Salvador denied, as aforestated, the certainty and\u00a0 authenticity of the\u00a0 first instrument of\u00a0 partition\u00a0 and admitted the sale recorded\u00a0 in the second one which, however, was not drawn up in her presence; and notwithstanding that the said opponent did\u00a0 not explain how that\u00a0 sale could have been effected without the authorization of her husband, as she was already a married woman\u00a0 on the date when she executed it, yet this court has no need to concern itself with the questions to which such a circumstance might give rise, in spite of the ratification or confirmation of the sale on the part of the vendor.<br\/><br\/>The sole\u00a0 object of this decision is to decide whether the applicant acted fraudulently in asking for the registration of one-half of\u00a0 the land in question, which half, according to the possessory title, exclusively belonged and belongs to the opponent.<br\/><br\/>Had the applicant acted in good faith, he would frankly, and of his own accord, have stated the nature and conditions of the instrument of partition,\u00a0 Exhibit B, and expressly have requested that the opponent, whose name appears in the said title as the legitimate and sole owner of all the land, be summoned, in order that she might have knowledge of the registration applied for by him, and might confirm the truth of the\u00a0 agreement of partition set\u00a0 forth in the document mentioned; but be showed no\u00a0 interest in having any\u00a0 of these things\u00a0 done; and endeavored to obtain, and did obtain, a decree\u00a0 of registration without the opponent's knowledge and\u00a0 behind her back, which decree,\u00a0 had the review that was requested and filed within the term allowed by law not been granted, would have deprived\u00a0 the opponent of her property.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons,\u00a0 and because the judgment appealed from\u00a0 is found to be in accordance with the. law, as regards the first part thereof, it is proper, in our opinion, to affirm the same, as we hereby do, thereby annulling and canceling the decree of December\u00a0 3,\u00a0 1908, which directs the registration, applied for by Ruperto Salva, of one-half of the said land; and the second part of the aforementioned judgment is reversed\u00a0 or\u00a0 set\u00a0 aside.\u00a0\u00a0 It is ordered\u00a0 that another decree of registration of the property concerned be issued in favor of the opponent Adriapa Salvador, for which she may make\u00a0 a separate\u00a0 application.\u00a0 No special finding is made as to the costs of both instances.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C, J., Johnson, Moreland,<\/i> and <i>Trent, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><\/div>",

The present complaint drawn under the provisions\u00a0 of\u00a0 the said section 3, can not be held\u00a0 to be valid by\u00a0 the court unless it\u00a0 is amended in a manner to indicate\u00a0 that the prosecution is\u00a0 based\u00a0 on\u00a0 the provisions of article 321\u00a0 of\u00a0 the Penal Code.\u00a0 Act No.\u00a0 1697 has\u00a0 in no way abrogated\u00a0 the provisions of the\u00a0 Penal Code as to false testimony, and\u00a0 the court, before deciding to sustain\u00a0 or overrule the\u00a0 demurrer interposed,\u00a0 required\u00a0 the prosecuting attorney\u00a0 to\u00a0 state whether\u00a0 or not he desired\u00a0 to\u00a0 amend the complaint\u00a0 in\u00a0 the manner indicated.\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"The prosecuting attorney stated that he did not believe it either\u00a0 necessary or\u00a0 convenient to amend the complaint and preferred that the validity of section 3 of Act No. 1697 should be definitely decided by the Supreme Court. The judge, in\u00a0 view of this statement of the prosecuting attorney, sustains the demurrer and orders\u00a0 that the accused be set at liberty from their\u00a0 present confinement.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>From\u00a0 this decision of the\u00a0 lower court, sustaining the demurrer, the\u00a0 prosecuting\u00a0 attorney of said province appealed to this court.<\/p><p>The lower court found difficulty in sustaining\u00a0 section 3 of Act No. 1697.\u00a0 The\u00a0 question of the validity of section 3 of said Act has already\u00a0 been passed upon\u00a0 by this\u00a0 court. Evidently the attention of the lower court was not\u00a0 called to the decisions in\u00a0 the cases of U. S. <em>vs<\/em>. Concepcion (13 Phil. Rep., 424); U.\u00a0 S.\u00a0 <em>vs.<\/em> De Chaves\u00a0 (14 Phil. Rep., 565); and U. S. <em>vs<\/em>.\u00a0 Estrana (16 Phil Rep., 520).\u00a0 All the difficulties which the lower court presents in his decision to the validity of said section 3 seem\u00a0 to be conclusively answered in the decision in the case of U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Concepcion, the objection as to the scope of said section, as well as to the contents and to the title of said law.\u00a0 It is true that section 1 of Act No. 6 of the Laws of the Commission provides that \"All laws shall, before the enacting clause, be\u00a0 prefaced by a title stating\u00a0 the purpose and\u00a0 scope\u00a0 of the Act,\" but,\u00a0 as was said in\u00a0 the case of U. S. <em>vs<\/em>. Concepcion,\u00a0 \"This provision being found only in an Act of the Commission, it was entirely within the power of the Commission to repeal it entirely or to disregard it in any particular case.\"\u00a0 Act No. 1697 of the Philippine Commission is a general\u00a0 law and there seems to be no provision of law which the Commission or Legislature are\u00a0 obliged to follow requiring it to state specifically in the title of each Act the purpose and scope of such Act.\u00a0 The only\u00a0 provision\u00a0 of law\u00a0 relating\u00a0 to this question is that found in section 5 of the Act of Congress of July 1,1902, and is as follows:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"That<em> no private or local\u00a0 bill<\/em> which\u00a0 may be enacted into a law shall embrace more than one subject, and that subject shall be expressed in the title of the bill.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>This provision is evidently mandatory and binding upon the legislature of the Philippine Islands, but it\u00a0 had\u00a0 no application\u00a0 to\u00a0 general laws.\u00a0 However advisable\u00a0 it may be for the legislature to follow said provision of section 1 of Act No. 6 for the information of the public, yet said provision (sec. 1, Act No. 6) is a mere rule for the guidance of the legislature and it may or may not follow\u00a0 it at its pleasure, it being a rule for the guidance of the legislature simply.\u00a0\u00a0 In the cases above cited this court held\u00a0 that the articles\u00a0 of the Penal Code relating to perjury had been repealed by said Act\u00a0 No.\u00a0 1697, and that that\u00a0 crime (perjury) is now defined and punished by section 3 of said Act<\/p><p>Therefore the judgment of the lower court sustaining the demurrer is hereby reversed and it is\u00a0 hereby ordered that the case be remanded to the lower court and that the defendants be duly arraigned under said complaint.\u00a0\u00a0 Without any finding as to costs, it is so ordered.<\/p><p><em>Torres, Mapa, Carson, <\/em>and <em>Moreland, JJ.<\/em>, concur.<\/p><\/div>",

Julio\u00a0 Llorente\u00a0 presiding, of the crime of calumny, and each sentenced to five months'<i> arresto mayor<\/i>, to pay a fine of 625 pesetas, with the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency and to each pay one-half of the costs.\u00a0 They appealed, and now insist that the trial court erred:<br\/><ol type=\"1\"><li>In permitting the trial to proceed upon the complaint of the provincial fiscal;<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>In finding that the proof s presented established the guilt of the defendants of the crime of calumny beyond a reasonable doubt; and,<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>In applying the provisions of paragraph 1, article 454, of the Penal\u00a0 Code.<\/li><\/ol>From the record it appears that Trinidad 6. Cruz, single, 22 years of age, and the defendants, who are husband and wife, were, during\u00a0 the months of May and June, 1909, traveling merchants or peddlers.\u00a0 The defendants desiring to go to the town\u00a0 of San Juan de Guimba for the purpose of selling their goods it was agreed that Trinidad stay over night at their house to take care\u00a0 of the children and to look after certain effects which we.re deposited in said house.\u00a0 In pursuance of this agreement, the defendants left on May 29, leaving Trinidad in charge of their house,\u00a0 where\u00a0 she remained until\u00a0 early the following morning when she left for Manila before the defendants' return.\u00a0 The\u00a0 defendants, on examining their trunk some two days later, found that a certain diamond ring was missing.\u00a0 On making this\u00a0 discovery they called on Emilia Lumutan, cousin of the offended party, and said that Trinidad had taken the ring.\u00a0 Emilia caused her cousin,\u00a0 who was still in Manila, to be notified of this charge.\u00a0 Trinidad returned\u00a0 home and the two\u00a0 defendants on June 22 went to the house where she\u00a0 was living and accused her, in the presence of three witnesses, of having taken the said ring.\u00a0 She protested against this accusation, declaring that she\u00a0 was innocent of such a charge, and went before the justice of the peace on the 24th of that month and filed a criminal complaint\u00a0 against her\u00a0 accusers,\u00a0 charging them with the crime of <i>injurias.<\/i>\u00a0 An investigation followed and the defendants were held to answer to\u00a0 this charge in the Court of First Instance.\u00a0\u00a0 A new complaint was filed in the Court\u00a0 of First Instance by the provincial\u00a0 fiscal, charging' the defendants with the crime\u00a0 of calumny.\u00a0\u00a0 This new complaint was not signed by the offended party.\u00a0 The fiscal conducted the prosecution the same as in other cases.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the defendants insists that calumny being a private crime can only be prosecuted\u00a0 on the complaint of the offended party, except\u00a0 in those cases wherein\u00a0 special provision is otherwise made, and in support of this proposition cites paragraph 2, article 467 of the Penal Code, which reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"No one shall be punished for calumny or contumely unless on complaint of the offended party, except when the offense is directed against the\u00a0 public authority, corporations, or determined classes in the State, and in the cases prescribed in Chapter V of Title III of this book.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Under the Penal Code this contention of counsel\u00a0 appears to be well founded, as the case under consideration does not come within the\u00a0 exceptions.<br\/><br\/>The first section of Act No. 1773, passed October 11, 1907, provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"Hereafter the crimes of <i>adulterio, estupro,\u00a0 rapto, violacion, calumnia, and injuria<\/i>, as\u00a0 defined by the Penal Code of the Philippine Islands, shall be deemed to be public crimes and shall be prosecuted in the same manner as are all other crimes defined\u00a0 by said Penal Code or by the Acts of the Philippine Commission: Provided,\u00a0 however,\u00a0 That no prosecution for the\u00a0 crimes of<i> adulterio, estupro,\u00a0 or injuria<\/i> committed\u00a0 against persons other\u00a0 than\u00a0 public\u00a0 officials or employees shall be instituted except upon the complaint of the\u00a0 aggrieved person\u00a0 or of the prents, grandparents, or guardian of such person.\"<\/blockquote>The crimes mentioned in the foregoing section are now public offenses and are prosecuted in\u00a0 the same manner as are all other public offenses,\u00a0 except\u00a0 prosecutions for the crimes of <i>adulterio<\/i> and <i>estupro<\/i>; and for the crime of <i>injuria,<\/i> when this, latter crime is not committed against public officials or employees, can only be instituted upon the complaint of the aggrieved person,\u00a0 or the parents, grandparents, or guardian of such person.\u00a0 No such provision was made with reference to <i>rapto, violacion,<\/i> and,<i> calumnia. <\/i> These were made public offenses\u00a0 without any restrictions\u00a0 as to the manner in which they should be instituted.\u00a0 Calumny is now a public crime and can be prosecuted upon the complaint of the provincial fiscal, while <i>injuria<\/i> can only be prosecuted upon the complaint of the offended party, when such offended party is not a public official or employee.\u00a0 It was the\u00a0 intention\u00a0 of\u00a0 the legislative body that\u00a0 these two\u00a0 crimes be treated\u00a0 in this manner and the will of the Legislature, as clearly expressed in the above section, is now the law of the land.<br\/><br\/>The next question to be determined is whether or not the crime which the defendants accused the\u00a0 offended party of having committed is \"grave\" or \"less grave.\"<br\/><br\/>Articles 6, 25, 452,\u00a0 and 454 of the Penal Code are as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Art.\u00a0 6. Crimes are considered\u00a0 'grave' which\u00a0 the\u00a0 law punishes by\u00a0 penalties\u00a0 which in any\u00a0 of\u00a0 their degrees are corporal.<br\/><br\/>\"Crimes\u00a0 are considered 'less grave' which the law represses\u00a0 by\u00a0 penalties which\u00a0 in\u00a0 their maximum degree are correccional.\"<br\/><br\/>\"Art. 25. The penalties which may be imposed according to this code, and their\u00a0 different classes, are those included in the following general scale:<br\/><br\/>\"<i>Corporal penalties<\/i>. - Death; <i>cadena perpetua; reclusion perpetua; relegacion perpetua; <\/i>perpetual\u00a0 expulsion; <i>cadena temporal; reclusion\u00a0 temporal; relegacton temporal<\/i>; temporary explusion; <i>presidio mayor; prision mayor; confinamiento;<\/i>\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>\"<i><i>Correctional penalties<\/i><\/i>. - P<i>residio correccional;\u00a0 prision correccional;\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 arresto mayor.\"<\/i><br\/><br\/>\"Art. 452. Calumny is the false imputation of a crime of those subject to prosecution at the instance of the Government (<i>de oficio<\/i>).\"<br\/><br\/>\"Art.\u00a0 454. When the calumny is not made public and put into writing it shall be punished:<br\/><br\/>\"1. With the penalties of arresto mayor in its maximum degree and a fine of from 625 to 6,250 pesetas if a grave crime be charged.<br\/><br\/>\"2. With that\u00a0 of arresto mayor in its\u00a0 minimum degree and a fine of from 325 to 3,250 pesetas if a less grave crime be charged.\"<\/blockquote>It is alleged in the complaint that the defendants did maliciously and falsely, with a view to dishonoring or holding up to contempt, Trinidad B. Cruz, charge her with the crime of robbery.\u00a0 According to articles 6 and 25, above quoted, robbery,\u00a0 as alleged\u00a0 in the complaint, is a \"grave\" crime.<br\/><br\/>While\u00a0 it is alleged in the complaint that the accused charged the offended party with the crime of robbery, the proofs do not support\u00a0 this allegation.\u00a0\u00a0 According to the testimony of the offended party\u00a0 herself, the\u00a0 defendants charged\u00a0 her\u00a0 with having taken the ring.\u00a0 They did not charge her with having taken the ring by employing force. The defendants in their testimony state that on examining their trunk they found that\u00a0 the ring was missing.\u00a0\u00a0 This testimony is\u00a0 uncontradicted and shows that no force was used in obtaining possession of the ring.\u00a0\u00a0 From the\u00a0 whole history of the case it clearly\u00a0 appears that the defendants did knowingly and\u00a0 maliciously charge the\u00a0 offended\u00a0 party with having stolen the ring, and not with\u00a0 having obtained it\u00a0 by force.\u00a0 So\u00a0 the\u00a0 real crime\u00a0 imputed\u00a0 to the offended party was that of larceny and not robbery.\u00a0 The value of the ring\u00a0 is not known, but under the provisions of articles 517 and\u00a0 518\u00a0 of the Penal Code the highest penalty\u00a0 which can be imposed for the crime of larceny is <i>correccional.<\/i> The crime\u00a0 imputed to the offended party\u00a0 being less grave, under the provisions of the Code above quoted, the penalty set out in paragraph 2 of said article 454 must be applied.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from\u00a0 is, therefore, reversed and each of the defendants is hereby sentenced to one month and one day <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">arresto mayor,<\/span> to pay a fine of 325 pesetas, to suffer the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to each pay\u00a0 one-half\u00a0 of the costs.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Albert\u00a0 E. McCabe, judge of the Court of First Instance for the Tenth Judicial District, sitting in Bacolod, Occidental Negros, to imprisonment for seventeen\u00a0 years and four months, and\u00a0 to indemnify, jointly and severally, the heirs of Santiago Bolanon in the sum of P1,000 and Leona Bolanon in the sum of P50, together with the costs, for the crime of homicide.<br\/><br\/>Although the three defendants were joined in the information, Francisco Billado, owing to his absence at the time the case was called for trial, was tried and sentenced separately, his sentence being, however, in the\u00a0 precise terms of the sentence against the other defendants.<br\/><br\/>Early in the evening of Friday, February 26, 1909, the deceased, Santiago Bolanon, an elderly man, residing at a place known as Sandayon,\u00a0 situated at a distance\u00a0 of some three hours' walk from the town\u00a0 of Sagay, Occidental Negros,\u00a0 was assaulted by three\u00a0 men armed with\u00a0 bolos while near the foot of the stairs of his house, from which he had just descended.\u00a0 His\u00a0 daughter,\u00a0 Leona Bolanon, hearing the disturbance,\u00a0 looked\u00a0 out\u00a0 of\u00a0 the window and saw the assault, whereupon she armed herself with a bolo and attacked the assailants, but not until they had fatally wounded her father,\u00a0 who remained\u00a0 unconscious\u00a0 until he died\u00a0 early the next morning from the effects\u00a0 of his wounds.<br\/><br\/>At the time of the assault the only persons at home besides the deceased were his daughter, Leona, and her mother, but the mother\u00a0 did not appear as a witness in any of the proceedings against the defendants on account, it is claimed, of her illness.\u00a0 The identification of the defendants as the assailants of the deceased\u00a0 rests solely upon the\u00a0 testimony of his daughter, Leona Bolanon.<br\/><br\/>The defendants do not deny the circumstances\u00a0 which resulted\u00a0 in the death\u00a0 of\u00a0 Santiago Bolanon, but claim to have no knowledge of the\u00a0 deed, save what\u00a0 they learned\u00a0 from others,\u00a0 and\u00a0 attempted to account for their several whereabouts at the time\u00a0 of the occurrence in question.\u00a0 Thus it is apparent that the case\u00a0 hinges\u00a0 upon the weight which should be given the\u00a0 testimony of the witness Leona Bolanon, with all the surrounding circumstances, and\u00a0 the evidence in support of the alibi set up by each of the defendants.<br\/><br\/>Leona Bolanon, 18 years\u00a0 of age, having identified each of the defendants as they sat in the court room, testified as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"On Friday afternoon about 6\u00a0 o'clock my father\u00a0 went downstairs from the\u00a0 house.\u00a0 Hearing a noise downstairs, I looked out of the window and saw my father being tied up by these men.\u00a0 After they had finished tying\u00a0 him, <i>they brought him upstairs\u00a0 into the house,<\/i> and while doing so Francisco and Lorenzo were laying\u00a0 the bolo on my father's shoulder.\u00a0 When they arrived at\u00a0 the\u00a0 door of our house, Francisco delivered a\u00a0 blow on my\u00a0 father's head with the bolo, striking him about the\u00a0 middle part of the right side of the\u00a0 forehead, over the right\u00a0 eye.\u00a0 When my father turned\u00a0 his head around, Lorenzo then\u00a0 struck him a\u00a0 blow in the center of the forehead with a sharp fighting\u00a0 bolo. When I saw my father fall down after he had been struck in the\u00a0 middle of the forehead,\u00a0 I ran to the room and got a bolo.\u00a0 When I came out I was\u00a0 met by Lorenzo, and he struck\u00a0 me with his bolo, and I parried the blow and was struck\u00a0 on my finger.\u00a0 After he had struck\u00a0 me with his fighting\" bolo, I returned the blow with my\u00a0 bolo, and he striking at me\u00a0 with the bolo he had, I parried\u00a0 the blow, both still\u00a0 striking, and the blade of\u00a0 his\u00a0 bolo\u00a0 separated from the handle, and it was then that the hand-guard and the ring fell\u00a0 to the ground.\u00a0 After the blade of his bolo had separated from the handle\u00a0 and he\u00a0 had seen\u00a0 that fact, he picked\u00a0 up the\u00a0 blade of\u00a0 his bolo and jumped\u00a0 from the house, passing through the doorway.\u00a0 Hilarion was standing on\u00a0 one of the steps of\u00a0 the stairway; he did\u00a0 not enter the room.\u00a0 All\u00a0 three\u00a0 were armed.\u00a0 After they jumped down from the\u00a0 house they ran\u00a0 away.\u00a0 The next morning I found that the door of our corral (<i>toril)<\/i>, where the three carabaos were, had been\u00a0 opened.\u00a0 Previous to the\u00a0 occurrence the corral\u00a0 had been closed.<br\/><br\/>\"It cost me P50 to cure the\u00a0 wound which I received on my finger, and I can not now [six months after the occurrence] bend the finger.\u00a0 [Witness shows scar on knuckle of third finger of left hand.]<br\/><br\/>\"At the time\u00a0 the wounds were inflicted on my fathers' head he <i>was somewhat inside the doorway and was tied.

When Esteban arrived at the house and he found or discovered that your father had a large wound, did he not ask\u00a0 you the\u00a0 cause?\u00a0 To which she replied: How could Esteban ask regarding what had happened\u00a0 in the house, as we had all we could do to try to keep him (her father) from dying, as half of his\u00a0 head was already broken?<br\/><br\/>\"Q. As he had seen these three men that were fleeing at a\u00a0 distance,\u00a0 didn't he\u00a0 ask\u00a0 you\u00a0 regarding\u00a0 them when\u00a0 he arrived\u00a0 at the house? - A.\u00a0 I stated before\u00a0 that <i>he had\u00a0 no time to ask about what\u00a0 had happened in\u00a0 the house.<\/i>\u00a0 We had all we could do to assist my father, who was dying.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>On the trial of the defendants Sison and De la Cruz, Esteban Ugaban, brother-in-law of Leona, as a witness for the prosecution, testified that he arrived at the house of his father-in-law about 6 o'clock and that as he was approaching the house he saw three men at a distance running away; that he did not recognize any of them, and that he was\u00a0 acquainted with Lorenzo Sison.\u00a0 This witness (Esteban) further testified that - <br\/><blockquote>\"The\u00a0 next morning my mother-in-law told me to go to the town and report what happened to my father-in-law.\u00a0 They desired\u00a0 me to.report the matter, that he died\u00a0 because\u00a0 he was\u00a0 wounded by blows inflicted upon him\u00a0 with boJos, and they stated to me: 'Go ahead to the town and report this, and Roman and Leona will follow\u00a0 afterwards and give the whole version of the affair.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *'\u00a0 They were afraid that they would be blamed\u00a0 for what happened in case that the time should expire for reporting the matter.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>On the trial of the defendant Billado, Esteban testified that it was after sunset\u00a0 when he arrived at his father-in-law's house, and that as he approached the\u00a0 house the three men who were running away were distant about 15 brazas. Esteban saw the wounds on his father-in-law's head.\u00a0 He remained all night in\u00a0 his\u00a0 father-in-law's house, assisting Leona in caring for\u00a0 the\u00a0 deceased.\u00a0 On reaching town the next day, February 27, he simply reported to the justice of the peace that his father-in-law had died.\u00a0 Being asked on cross-examination if he had not at the time filed a complaint before the said\u00a0 justice\u00a0 of the\u00a0 peace, he admitted that he put his\u00a0 cross to the complaint which\u00a0 was\u00a0 introduced in evidence as defendants' exhibit.\u00a0 This complaint is signed by Esteban Ugaban, under date of February 27, and charges that the\u00a0 crime\u00a0 was\u00a0 committed in the following manner by <i>three unknown persons<\/i> at 6 o'clock on the evening of February 26:<br\/><blockquote>\"They presented themselves\u00a0 beneath\u00a0 the\u00a0 house of Santiago Bolanon,\u00a0 father-in-law of complainant, and\u00a0 while trying to open the corral beneath said house for the purpose of stealing the carabaos, Santiago appeared, whereupon they immediately\u00a0 bound him, inflicting upon him\u00a0 at the same time the\u00a0 wounds from which he\u00a0 died\u00a0 at\u00a0 4 o'clock this morning - also wounding his daughter, Leona, who came to the defense of her father.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Felix Gaspar\u00a0 testified on behalf of the prosecution that the guard and ring referred to by the\u00a0 witness Leona\u00a0 Bolanon were of the same shape and form as a guard and ring constituting part of a\u00a0 bob\u00a0 belonging\u00a0 to defendant Lorenzo Sison, claiming that Lorenzo on a certain Wednesday left the bolo to which the guard and ring belonged at his house, but came and took it away again on the same day.<br\/><br\/>Lorenzo Sison\u00a0 on his own\u00a0 behalf testified\u00a0 that the bolo which the prosecution had\u00a0 exhibited to\u00a0 the witness Leona Bolanon, and which she admitted was similar to the bolo in the\u00a0 possession of the person with whom she had\u00a0 the encounter at\u00a0 the time when she came to the rescue of\u00a0 her father, was his bolo and that it was the only fighting bolo that he owned.<br\/><br\/>Although the possession of this bolo by the prosecution is not clearly accounted for, it is pretty certain from\u00a0 the evidence that it was taken from the house of Lorenzo Sison, during his absence, by order of the municipal\u00a0 president of Sagay.<br\/><br\/>It further appeared from the uncontradicted testimony of this defendant that he was a political opponent of Epifanio\u00a0 Tupas, then president of Sagay, and\u00a0 that\u00a0 enmity existed between both\u00a0 the president and the justice of the peace\u00a0 on the one hand and this defendant on the other, by reason of some previous lawsuit, so that they were not on speaking terms.<br\/><br\/>Defendant Sison and several witnesses on his behalf testified that on Saturday morning, February 27, he left the town of Sagay in a boat for the town\u00a0 of Barotac\u00a0 Nuevo, in the Province of Uoilo, for the purpose of bringing his mother and sister to his home in\u00a0 Sagay.\u00a0 Being detained there\u00a0 on\u00a0 account\u00a0 of\u00a0 bad weather, he\u00a0 did\u00a0 not return for nearly a week, and upon his return immediately heard that a warrant was out for his arrest for complicity in the murder of the deceased, Santiago Bolanon, whereupon he at once repaired to the tribunal and surrendered himself.\u00a0 Credible evidence of disinterested witnesses was also presented on behalf of this defendant to show that he engaged the boat for the purpose of going over to Barotac late in the afternoon of Friday, the day of the murder.<br\/><br\/>Each of the other defendants supported his alibi by evidence, in addition to his own testimony.\u00a0 As this case must, in our opinion, be disposed of upon the evidence of the prosecution rather than that of the defense, we\u00a0 do not deem it necessary to enter into the details of these defenses.<br\/><br\/>Leona Bolanon being the only witness for the prosecution who claims to identify the defendants as the perpetrators of the crime, the\u00a0 commission of which is not questioned, we must determine whether or not the testimony of this witness is sufficiently credible to justify the court in convicting these defendants.\u00a0 In analyzing the\u00a0 testimony of this witness the point considered is not whether she saw certain persons assault her father, or whether in attempting to rescue her father she had an\u00a0 encounter with one of his assailants and was\u00a0 herself wounded.\u00a0\u00a0 These points are entirely credible. The\u00a0 question is whether the assault upon the deceased and the encounter of his daughter with one of his assailants took place, as the daughter claims, in the house and under circumstances such as\u00a0 would\u00a0 enable her to recognize the assailants, or whether it took place on the ground near the house and in\u00a0 the midst of such darkness that the daughter was\u00a0 unable to identify the assailants.\u00a0 The first extraordinary proposition\u00a0 that\u00a0 this\u00a0 sole\u00a0 witness\u00a0 against these defendants sets forth is that these three men, two of whom, being tenants of the neighboring hacienda, were well known to herself and presumably to her father, should come to their house by daylight for the purpose of stealing their carabaos. Such a situation is not only extraordinary, but, generally speaking, inconsistent with human experience and with the motives that\u00a0 actuate human beings.\u00a0 Ordinarily strangers from an unknown locality would not attempt such a deed, much less neighbors who were acquainted with the persons and surroundings of the assailed party.\u00a0 This circumstance alone is so altogether inexplicable as to arouse the gravest doubt as to the daughter's claim that the robbers came to their house at a time of day when it was so light she could identify them.\u00a0 If it was dark when the assault upon\u00a0 her father took place, then Leona, though she went to the rescue, would have had great difficulty in recognizing the offenders, unless they came up into\u00a0 the house, where there doubtless was a light.\u00a0 And, again, why should men caught in the act of stealing their neighbor's carabaos first bind such neighbor and then when he was helpless carry him\u00a0 into the house and there deliberately murder him in\u00a0 the presence of his wife and daughter ? There is no pretense that any enmity existed between the defendant and the deceased.\u00a0 The defendant Sison positively testified that\u00a0 the\u00a0 deceased was one of\u00a0 his good friends.\u00a0 Leona was sure that the purpose that brought the robbers there was to steal their carabaos.\u00a0\u00a0 Then, if this be true, it is inconceivable why they should have tied their victim while they were downstairs and then carry him up into the house for the purpose of murdering him.\u00a0\u00a0 They knew that his daughter was there, because she had begged them to desist\u00a0 their assault upon her father and one of them had told her to be quiet.\u00a0 They also knew that they would be recognized by the daughter if they entered the sola.\u00a0 According to\u00a0 Leona's theory, the defendants left the sala after they had killed her father and seriously wounded her.\u00a0 If it was their intention to rob these victims, then there was no reason\u00a0 why they should have left at that time after their victims were practically helpless, and no other person had yet arrived.\u00a0 It is more probable that when the daughter found that her\u00a0 intercessions with her father's\u00a0 assailants were ineffective,\u00a0 she seized a bolo and ran\u00a0 downstairs to rescue him and there\u00a0 had an encounter with the assailants, receiving a\u00a0 wound on her hand.\u00a0 Not only does this\u00a0 conform to the natural course of events, but it explains why\u00a0 the ring and the guard of the bolo were found on\u00a0 the ground near the house, or under\u00a0 the stairway, the next morning. And, furthermore, before\u00a0 retiring for the night the deceased went down to look after his carabaos; he did this at the precise time his assailants were attempting secretly to appropriate the animals, and, being caught in the act, they turned on him.\u00a0 His daughter, hearing the disturbance, appealed to them to\u00a0 release\u00a0 him.\u00a0 Finding her appeal\u00a0 disregarded she went to his assistance.\u00a0 The charge filed by\u00a0 Esteban Ugaban before the justice of the peace on tihe morning after the assault strongly\u00a0 corroborates the\u00a0 theory that\u00a0 both assaults, one upon the\u00a0 deceased and the other upon his daughter, took\u00a0 place outside the\u00a0 house and in\u00a0 the\u00a0 dark.\u00a0\u00a0 The language of Esteban's complaint shows that instead\u00a0 of being ignorant of the circumstances under which the deceased\u00a0 met his death,\u00a0 he was fully advised of all the\u00a0 facts except the persons who committed the deed.\u00a0\u00a0 Not being at the\u00a0 house at the time of the assault he could have ascertained these facts only from Leona.\u00a0 It is so inherently improbable that Leona told him all of these circumstances and yet failed to\u00a0 mention the fact\u00a0 that\u00a0 his\u00a0 acquaintances, her acquaintances,\u00a0 her father's acquaintances, their neighbors, the defendants, Sison and Billado, were the men who murdered the deceased.\u00a0\u00a0 If her testimony as to\u00a0 the events that she cjaims occurred at the house are true,\u00a0 then, of course,\u00a0 she was sure\u00a0 who\u00a0 the murderers were.\u00a0 Being sure she could not have refrained from imparting the information to her brother-in-law, along with the other facts\u00a0 that\u00a0 his\u00a0 complaint shows\u00a0 he knew. When Leona was asked to explain why she sent her brother-in-law to Sagay to report her father's cleath, without telling him all she now claims she then knew, she gives this extraordinary answer:<br\/><blockquote>\"I stated before that he\u00a0 had no time to ask about what happened in the house.\u00a0 We had all we could do to assist my father who was dying.\"<\/blockquote>But it must be noted that her father died about 4 o'clock and Esteban did not start for Sagay until some time later. Esteban and Leona were together during the whole night and for some time\u00a0 after the deceased died.\u00a0 If she had known the assailants, it would have been the most natural thing in the\u00a0 world\u00a0 for\u00a0 her to\u00a0 have given this information to\u00a0 her brother-in-law during this time.<br\/><br\/>That this\u00a0 atrocious murder was\u00a0 committed there is no question, but the sole testimony - that of Leona - upon which the judgment of the lower\u00a0 court rests, as to the identification of the defendants, is so inherently improbable and inconsistent with human experience that it can not form the basis of a conviction in this case.<br\/><br\/>For these reasons\u00a0 the judgment is reversed and\u00a0 the defendants acquitted, with costs <i>de oficio.<\/i><br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Mapa, Carson,<\/i> and <i>Moreland, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><\/div>",

Shortly before the attack on the Cuchapin house the house of Pascual Ancheta was attacked. The latter states that the ladrones, after maltreating him, left the house, leaving one of their number to watch it; that this was Gregorio de la Rosa, but he was relieved by one Jorge Diego; that among the ladrones he recognized Gregorio de la Rosa and Roberto Manzano, and that from the place where he was he heard noises from the place where the Cuchapin house was located. The matter was reported on the same night and Gregorio de la Rosa arrested. There had not previously existed any trouble between the accused and the offended parties and Pascual Ancheta which would explain the motive for their being robbed by the accused.\"<\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>The foregoing facts were proven beyond peradventure of doubt.

Jose C. Abreu presiding, convicting the appellant of the crime of parricide and sentencing her to reelusidn perpetua, to the accessories provided by law, and to pay the costs of the trial.<br\/><br\/>The information filed against the accused charged:<br\/><blockquote>\"That in the municipality of\u00a0 Sorsogon, Province of Sorsogon, P. L, on or about the 23d day of April of the present year (1909), Claudio Chavez, being in his house, in company with\u00a0 his wife, the accused, a dispute\u00a0 arose between them caused by the jealousy of the husband toward the accused by reason of her alleged relations with a policeman, Fermin Micaller; that as a result of the dispute the accused seized a shoe and struck her\u00a0 husband in the face with\u00a0 the heel of it, and, not contented with this, the said accused, being in possession of a knife, 5\u00a3 centimeters or inches in length, struck her husband a blow with it in the abdomen, causing a wound in the epigastrium from which the said Claudio Chavez died within a few hours.\u00a0 In violation of the law.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>No one saw the commission of the crime except the accused and her\u00a0 deceased\u00a0 husband.\u00a0 The\u00a0 Government presented several witnesses in support of its accusation against\u00a0 the appellant.<br\/><br\/>Pedro Paguia, the physician who examined the\u00a0 deceased before his death, testified that he found a wound of considerable depth which had intersected the stomach and the vessels of that region, caused by a sharp and pointed instrument; that its direction was\u00a0 inward\u00a0 and\u00a0 downward; that said wound was mortal, and that it was the cause of the death of the deceased.<br\/><br\/>Bernabe Flores Palma, justice of the peace of Sorsogon, testified that he immediately went to the house where\u00a0 the crime was committed for the purpose of making an investigation and found the deceased lying on\u00a0 his back on the floor, with a wound in his stomach; that he was\u00a0 unable\u00a0 to speak distinctly, but was able, nevertheless, when\u00a0 interrogated by the witness as to what had occurred, to say that - <br\/><blockquote>\"He and his wife, Juliana Brioso, had had a quarrel; that his\u00a0 wife Juliana struck him in the face with a shoe and then immediately struck him in the stomach with a knife; that on feeling himself wounded in\u00a0 the stomach\u00a0 he\u00a0 wrested the knife from the hands of his wife and stabbed her; that the wife on being wounded went out of the\u00a0 house and he did not see anything more of her because he remained lying on his\u00a0 back on the floor; afterwards he asked\u00a0 for the services of a priest.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The witness Flores further stated that after his investigations in the barrio, he again went to see the deceased, about 6 o'clock of the afternoon, and took his sworn statement, in which the deceased stated the facts as he had related them before.\u00a0 That his statement\u00a0 was taken after\u00a0 he had confessed to the priest.\u00a0 He further testified that he found the knife with which the crime had been committed under the petate, and that it was covered with blood; that the deceased did not sign his sworn statement because he was unable\u00a0 to raise himself sufficiently to\u00a0 use\u00a0 the pen;\u00a0 that\u00a0 during his statement he stopped frequently\u00a0 because he\u00a0 was in a\u00a0 very grave condition.<br\/><br\/>Domingo Aguirre, municipal secretary of Sorsogon,\u00a0 testified to the same facts substantially as the\u00a0 justice of the peace.\u00a0 He was the one who interpreted the dying declaration of the deceased.\u00a0 In regard to the condition of the deceased at the time of his declaration, he stated:<br\/><blockquote>\"According to my understanding he was in a\u00a0 very grave condition, and he,\u00a0 Claudio, said that he was going to die finally, this\u00a0 on account of the pain which he felt from the wound which he had.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Lieut.\u00a0 Juan Francisco\u00a0 of the Constabulary testified\u00a0 that, on the afternoon of the said 23d day of April, he also went to the house where the alleged crime had\u00a0 been\u00a0 committed for the purpose of investigating what\u00a0 had occurred; that on arriving there he found a man lying on his back with a wound in the stomach; that he asked him who had wounded him and the\u00a0 man replied\u00a0 that it was his wife and that he had done no more than defend himself; that the deceased was not able\u00a0 to speak well and that he heard no more than the statement that it was his wife who had stabbed him; that the injured man did little but complain of the pain which the wound caused him and to say that he was in a very bad condition.<br\/><br\/>Jose Capuz, an old friend of the\u00a0 deceased,\u00a0 testified that, arriving\u00a0 at the house where\u00a0 the event\u00a0 occurred, he found his friend wounded\u00a0 in the stomach; that he asked him who had wounded him; that Chavez answered him that he did no more than defend himself; that his wife had stabbed him and that he tried to defend himself and in so doing took the knife away from\u00a0 her and stabbed her; that he felt bad and\u00a0 that he was going to die; that he was anxious to\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 know if they could not get a priest for him; that all this trouble was caused because he\u00a0 desired to\u00a0 take his wife to another place.<br\/><br\/>These were the witnesses for\u00a0 the prosecution.<br\/><br\/>The sworn dying declaration of the deceased is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"I came from the ship and found my wife spinning hemp. We had a quarrel because I was jealous of her and a policeman called Fermin; in this dispute she struck me with a shoe in the face and after that wounded me with a knife in the stomach.\u00a0 The night before I requested her to be good friends with me, but instead of answering me she struck me with her fist.\u00a0 When I felt myself wounded I took the knife away from her and stabbed her in the breast.\u00a0 There was nobody\u00a0 present at that time or in the room where we were quarreling except ourselves; I do not know to whom the knife belonged, I swear that all that I have said is true, that it was my wife who wounded me in\u00a0 the stomach.\u00a0 I thus end my statement, not being able to proceed further in view of my very grave condition.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The appellant, Juliana Brioso, testified in her own behalf as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"On Tuesday night my\u00a0 husband came\u00a0 home\u00a0 from\u00a0 his ship; when he arrived he began abusing me, asking me if my<i> querido <\/i>was Fermin, and then went away, taking\u00a0 my trunk; the following day, about 2 o'clock of the afternoon, he came back; when he arrived I was sitting spinning hemp with my little child in my lap because I was trying to make him go\u00a0 to sleep; when he arrived he sat down in front of me and\u00a0 began asking me if Fermin was my <i>querido<\/i>, and I answered him, 'you are talking just\u00a0 to hear yourself talk;' after I answered him thus he slapped me and after he struck me I seized my little boy's shoe and struck him in the face with it; on being struck he arose and drew something from his belt, I do not know whether it was a knife or what, and when he had gotten onto his feet he struck me a blow and in defending myself\u00a0 he wounded\u00a0 me\u00a0 and then\u00a0 afterwards wounded me again, but I held my hand like this and he was unable to stab me very easily; I cried for help, whereupon he stabbed\u00a0 himself.\u00a0\u00a0 I saw only that he raised his arm and struck himself in the stomach, but I did not know whether he wounded himself or not.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Eduardo Lagarde, a witness for the defense, testified that, at about 12 o'clock, as the alleged murder was committed about 2 of\u00a0 the same day, he and a friend by the name of Sarmiento saw the accused Claudio Chavez in the market and had a conversation with him; that he was pale and appeared nervous and excited; that he stated to the witness and his companion that he was very jealous of his wife and had been so for a long time; that he asked their advice as to what he should do under\u00a0 the circumstances; that he was trembling and shaking to such an extent that he noticed it himself, and, placing himself before a mirror, he said, \"I am pale;\" that the deceased further said that he would get out of his trouble if it was not for his children; that that was what was making him thin, and if\u00a0 they did not give him\u00a0 what he wanted he would get it by fair\u00a0 means or foul.<br\/><br\/>Francisco Sarmiento, another witness for the defense, testified that\u00a0 he,\u00a0 in\u00a0 company with the previous witness, Lagarde, saw the deceased at 12\u00a0 o'clock of\u00a0 the\u00a0 day\u00a0 upon which the alleged murder was committed and had a conversation with him; that on being requested by Lagarde to assist the deceased in his trouble, he told him that\u00a0 they ought to arrange their matters amicably; that to this the deceased replied with the statement that he was disposed to wipe out his dishonor with his life,\u00a0 whereupon he went\u00a0 to the looking glass, and, having viewed his face therein, said, \"I am very thin;\" that the witness then told him that\u00a0 he ought not to excite himself so much over the matter; that they thereupon separated.<br\/><br\/>It appears from the testimony of Juliana Brioso that her husband had been jealous of her for more than a year and that he had frequently beaten her by reason thereof.<br\/><br\/>It also appears\u00a0 from the testimony of the physician who cared for the wounds of the accused,\u00a0 inflicted upon her by the deceased, that there was a wound in the left forearm and one in the breast, close to the heart; that the former was grave in its character, while the other was of such a nature that,\u00a0 at that time, he could not tell whether it would cause her death or not.<br\/><br\/>We have for decision on this appeal, as\u00a0 appears from the foregoing, simply a question of fact: Did the accused murder her husband or did he commit suicide?\u00a0 We have considered this question with the greatest care.\u00a0 We have studied\u00a0 it from\u00a0 every point of view.\u00a0 We can not bring ourselves to believe\u00a0 that the accused has been proved guilty\u00a0 by the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.\u00a0 We\u00a0 have here a man who,\u00a0 for something\u00a0 like two years, had been extremely jealous of his wife.\u00a0 He\u00a0 was, during that time, continually meditating\u00a0 upon it,\u00a0 continually\u00a0 talking\u00a0 to\u00a0 her about it, continually quarreling with her and beating her by reason of it.\u00a0 So much had he meditated upon it and such\u00a0 a hold had it taken upon him that, two hours before the alleged crime was committed, he had become so nervous,\u00a0 pale and haggard that it was a matter of special comment among his friends with whom\u00a0 he talked at\u00a0 that time.\u00a0 In this condition, two hours before the crime was committed, he, trembling and excited, had nervously seized one of said friends and drawn him aside for the\u00a0 purpose of\u00a0 asking\u00a0 his views in relation to his family difficulties.\u00a0\u00a0 At\u00a0 that time and place\u00a0 he had made remarks which clearly pointed to his\u00a0 present intention to commit suicide\u00a0 unless\u00a0 his troubles\u00a0 could be cured.<br\/><br\/>With these conditions\u00a0 presented undisputed\u00a0 in the evidence, we come to the stories\u00a0 told by the accused and the deceased.\u00a0 The accused states that she was quietly sitting at home, with her child in her lap, spinning hemp; that her husband suddenly\u00a0 came into the house at\u00a0 a time which, in view of the nature of his employment and his habits, was very unusual; that he sat down in front of\u00a0 her and began to upbraid her for her infidelity; that, becoming more furious, he struck her in,the face; that thereupon she seized a shoe belonging to the little child and struck him in the face with it; that he leaped up, drew a knife from his belt and stabbed\u00a0 her twice, the first blow producing a serious gash in the left forearm, which she had thrown up to protect herself,\u00a0 and the second producing a very dangerous wound in the vicinity of the heart; that, seeing the wound that he had made,\u00a0 and doubtless in the belief that\u00a0 he\u00a0 had murdered her, he then stabbed himself in the abdomen, inflicting his death wound.<br\/><br\/>On the other hand, we have the\u00a0 dying declaration of the deceased, in which he states\u00a0 that, on coming home\u00a0 and speaking to his wife about\u00a0 her infidelity to him, she first seized a shoe and struck him in the face and then stabbed him in the\u00a0 abdomen with a knife, producing the wound from which\u00a0 he later died; that,\u00a0 having\u00a0 received the wound, he wrested the dagger from her and stabbed her in the breast.<br\/><br\/>We are inclined to believe that the story told by the wife is the more credible of the two,\u00a0 as it is more in accord with all the\u00a0 circumstances and probabilities of the case:<br\/><br\/>(1) The mental and physical condition of the deceased two hours before the alleged crime was committed, as\u00a0 shown by the undisputed testimony of the case, the threat upon his part to\u00a0 wipe out his dishonor with his life, taken in connection with the fact that he had been almost insanely jealous of his wife for more than a\u00a0 year prior to the event, present the picture of a man in exactly the proper frame of mind to act as the accused alleges he\u00a0 did act on the day in question.<br\/><br\/>(2) It is\u00a0 undisputed that\u00a0 the\u00a0 wife, at\u00a0 the time the event occurred, was\u00a0 seated with her\u00a0 little child in her lap,\u00a0 endeavoring to put it to sleep;\u00a0 that in front of and about her were the instruments and material\u00a0 used\u00a0 in the spinning of hemp.\u00a0\u00a0 These facts are undisputed.\u00a0 It would\u00a0 seem\u00a0 quite unlikely, if\u00a0 not unreasonable, that in such\u00a0 condition and under\u00a0 such\u00a0 circumstances she\u00a0 should seize a\u00a0 knife and stab her husband fatally in the abdomen, driving the knife through the muscles and walls into the stomach and producing\u00a0 such a\u00a0 frightful gash that\u00a0 the food passed from the stomach out of the wound made by the dagger.\u00a0 Incumbered, \u00a6as she undisputably was, with the child and with the material and implements for the spinning of hemp,\u00a0 it approaches the unreasonable very closely to say that she could\u00a0 have done as she is alleged to have done in the dying declaration of the deceased.<br\/><br\/>(3) The wound in\u00a0 the abdomen of the deceased, as\u00a0 described by the physician who examined it, is precisely\u00a0 the wound that would naturally be made by a man stabbing himself as described by the accused.\u00a0 It is true that such a wound might have been made by the wife if she had stabbed him.\u00a0 It is more likely, however, that the wound would have presented a different aspect and would have taken a different course in the body if it had been made by the wife during a struggle or during the efforts of the husband to escape it.<br\/><br\/>(4)\u00a0 It appears undisputed from the evidence that the deceased had, by his jealous meditation, brought himself to the point where he had the firmest belief of her infidelity and therefore the greatest hatred of\u00a0 his wife's alleged paramour and an infinite dislike of their alleged relations.\u00a0 His regard for his wife\u00a0 had evidently changed into hatred,\u00a0 and he had stated, as disclosed by the proofs, that if it had not been for his children\u00a0 he would have left her\u00a0 long\u00a0 before.\u00a0 Having found, after he had delivered the fatal blow against himself, that his wife had not been killed by the knife thrust which he had given her, it is not at all unlikely that the hatred and odium which possessed him drove him to manufacture a story which, if believed, would forever prevent his wife and her paramour from again sustaining the relations which he believed they had sustained theretofore.<br\/><br\/>(5)\u00a0 Given the condition, mental and physical, in which the deceased\u00a0 is shown\u00a0 to have been at the time\u00a0 the alleged murder was\u00a0 committed, it would be a very possible act\u00a0 to murder his wife and then kill himself.\u00a0 That he attempted to kill his wife is beyond question and that he almost succeeded is equally beyond dispute.\u00a0\u00a0 That he at first believed that\u00a0 he had given her a fatal blow is undoubted from all the evidence of the\u00a0 case.<br\/><br\/>(6)\u00a0 While\u00a0 it is true that the\u00a0 statement of the deceased, to which he thereafter consistently adhered, was made soon after the event occurred, it is also true that the accused gave her version of the affair but a very few minutes after the event, and as consistently maintained it thereafter.\u00a0 Immediately after receiving the wound in the breast she left the house and went to the house of the lieutenant of the barrio for the purpose of telling her story.\u00a0 Finding him out, she at once started for\u00a0 the presidencia, but was overcome\u00a0 by her\u00a0 condition before arriving there.\u00a0 The first statement she made is the story above transcribed, to which she consistently and persistently adhered throughout.<br\/><br\/>(7) Under the custom of the country, it is unusual for a woman of the character and habits of the accused to carry or have about her the kind of knife which was used in the commission of the alleged crime.\u00a0 On the other hand, such a knife is habitually carried by sailors, to which class of workmen\u00a0 the deceased belonged.<br\/><br\/>(8) Lastly, it seems to us somewhat unlikely that, having received the frightful wound that he did, which, as we have said,\u00a0 opened the walls of\u00a0 the\u00a0 abdomen\u00a0 and destroyed the stomach to such an\u00a0 extent that the food which the\u00a0 latter contained passed outside\u00a0 of the\u00a0 body between the lips of the wound, the deceased\u00a0 would\u00a0 be\u00a0 able, in spite of\u00a0 such wound, to grapple with an\u00a0 ablebodied woman and forcibly take\u00a0 from her hand a knife and then\u00a0 hold her while\u00a0 he inflicted upon her two serious wounds, one almost fatal.\u00a0 It would appear that, naturally, such a terrible wound would produce such an effect upon the recipient that he would\u00a0 be entirely unable to put forth the strength\u00a0 required to accomplish\u00a0 such a result,\u00a0 especially\u00a0 in view of the great effort which the woman would make to prevent him,\u00a0 she\u00a0 well knowing that in all probability the loss of the knife meant the loss of her\u00a0 life.<br\/><br\/>These considerations lead us to the belief that there\u00a0 is at least a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused, and she is accordingly acquitted.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below is reversed, the accused acquitted and her discharge from custody ordered forthwith.<br\/><br\/><i>

From this judgment the defendants appealed.<\/p><p>The facts above related, fully\u00a0 proved\u00a0 in\u00a0 the trial of this cause, constitute unquestionably the crime of homicide,\u00a0 provided for and\u00a0 punished by article 404 of the Penal Code, inasmuch as the evidence shows beyond all doubt that\u00a0 Januario\u00a0 Mantala died a few hours after\u00a0 he had received four wounds, two of them of a mortal nature, in the right side and in the stomach, which caused a protrusion of the intestines; that the same were inflicted as the result of a quarrel\u00a0 that the deceased had\u00a0 with his brother-in-law, the said Dalmacio Paz, in the latter's\u00a0 house; and that none of the specific circumstances enumerated in article 403 of the Penal Code were present in the commission of the crime.<\/p><p>At the trial it was satisfactorily proven that Dalmacio Paz was solely responsible\u00a0 for the grave\u00a0 wounds that\u00a0 occasioned the death\u00a0 of Januario\u00a0 Mantala.\u00a0 The accused testified that he was obliged, in\u00a0 self-defense, to inflict the wounds on\u00a0 the\u00a0 said\u00a0 Mantala,\u00a0 who had assaulted\u00a0 him,\u00a0 in order to save himself from certain death.\u00a0 This confession of the defendant Paz involves an exculpatory allegation, not invalidated\u00a0 by any act or proof\u00a0 to the contrary; on the other hand, his\u00a0 plea is corroborated by the conduct of the deceased who, greatly biased in mind against his sister and his brother-in-law, the defendants, entered their house on the night\u00a0 of the crime, armed with a bolo,\u00a0 while they were asleep;\u00a0 after violently entering the said house,\u00a0 without the permission of its occupants,\u00a0 he\u00a0 insulted the latter,\u00a0 ill treated\u00a0 his own\u00a0 sister, the wife of the owner of the house, and assaulted the latter\u00a0 with the bolo; and,\u00a0 during the struggle, he received\u00a0 the wounds that caused his death.<\/p><p>The record shows\u00a0 no\u00a0 circumstantial evidence\u00a0 whatever to weaken the said plea of self-defense; and, as there were no eye-witnesses to the occurrence, there is no reason for refusing to admit the said plea.<\/p><p>If Januario Mantala,\u00a0 impelled\u00a0 by resentment,\u00a0 had not entered the house of the defendants, provided with a weapon, and insulted them and provoked the quarrel, and if he had not thus attacked his own sister and his brother-in-law with the intent to do them\u00a0 bodily harm, the defendant would not have been obliged to resist the assault and to act in defense of his person and his\u00a0 rights; hence it must\u00a0 be held that the commission\u00a0 of the homicide was attended by the\u00a0 circumstance of\u00a0 complete exemption\u00a0 from criminal\u00a0 liability, in asmuch as\u00a0 the\u00a0 said\u00a0 Dalmacio Paz\u00a0 acted\u00a0 in self-defense against an unlawful assault made upon him within his\u00a0 own house, without any provocation whatever on his part; therefore the accused, Paz, in\u00a0 defending himself while stretched out on the floor, with his assailant on top of\u00a0 him holding him by the throat, had rational need of the means he employed to free himself from\u00a0 imminent danger; the method which he used to defend himself was all the more\u00a0 reasonable since at that\u00a0 moment, except\u00a0 his wife, Agripina Mantala\u00a0 who was slightly wounded and frightened, no one else was\u00a0 present to assist him.\u00a0 The two brothers of the deceased were in the vicinity of the house, but instead of coming to the rescue, they took to their heels.<\/p><p>The present case therefore, falls within the\u00a0 provisions of paragraph 4 of article 8 of the Penal Code, which provides that he who acts in defense of his person and rights, provided there are\u00a0 attendant the three circumstances therein mentioned, is exempt from criminal\u00a0 liability.<\/p><p>According to the testimony of the defendants, for several days prior to the occurrence of the facts related,\u00a0 there had been trouble between them and Januario Mantala, notwithstanding their\u00a0 being near relatives,\u00a0 owing to Dalmacio's refusal to accept,\u00a0 because of its dilapidated condition,\u00a0 the house ceded to him in exchange for two hogs; that on Friday, the 27th of May, prior to the day of\u00a0 the occurrence of the crime charged, Januario, finding that the leaves of the coconut trees on his land had been destroyed, became very angry and, without reason, insulted the\u00a0 defendant and his wife notwithstanding that the damage to the trees had not been done by them.<\/p><p>The testimony of the widow with reference\u00a0 to\u00a0 the statements\u00a0 made by the deceased before he died, and the averment of the justice of the peace that this defendant had confessed to him that she had in self-defense\u00a0 attacked her brother Januario who had ill-treated and wounded her, is not sufficient to\u00a0 support the criminal charge against Agripina Mantala, inasmuch as the widow of the deceased may have been driven to give such testimony through the natural resentment engendered by her\u00a0 husband's death;\u00a0 and even though the\u00a0 deceased may have made ante-mortem statements\u00a0 accusing\u00a0 his\u00a0 own\u00a0 sister\u00a0 of having aided her own husband, it is to be\u00a0 supposed that he may have believed that she did, in the confusion that must have arisen inside of a house that was at\u00a0 most\u00a0 but\u00a0 poorly lighted; besides, when the deceased\u00a0 made such\u00a0 incriminating\u00a0 statements, no one else was present or heard them except the witness. Moreover, the justice of the peace testified that neither the statements of the widow, Francisca Pestano, with\u00a0 reference to the deceased, nor those of the defendants, when brought before him, were\u00a0 taken down\u00a0 in\u00a0 writing.\u00a0 The testimony of the said justice of the peace appears to be contradicted by the defendant, Agripina Mantala, who denied that she had, even in self-defense, attacked her brother, the deceased, and also by the sanitary inspector who examined the wounds of the deceased and positively declared that they had\u00a0 been inflicted with a bolo.\u00a0 There is, in addition, the fact\u00a0 that the defendant, Dalmacio\u00a0 Paz,\u00a0 in\u00a0 his confession, made no statement whatever with regard to his wife's having taken part in\u00a0 the struggle, but, on the contrary, corroborated her testimony to the effect that, as shown by the record, she was\u00a0 ill treated by her brother,\u00a0 the\u00a0 deceased,\u00a0 when\u00a0 she screamed for help on seeing the attack made by the latter upon her husband.<\/p><p>From all the foregoing, it is apparent that no\u00a0 conclusive proof whatever is\u00a0 afforded by the evidence, to show\u00a0 that the said defendant Agripina took\u00a0 any part in the struggle between her husband and her brother; however, even though she had done so, she would in all respects be exempt from criminal liability, for, in any event, she would have\u00a0 had in her favor the three requisite circumstances enumerated in paragraph 4 of article 8 of the Penal Code, as she would have been in a position\u00a0 identical with that of her husband. It was the deceased who insulted the defendants, provoked the quarrel and with a bolo attacked the latter in their\u00a0 house; so if there were perversity and malicious intent to do injury, it was not on the part of the parties attacked,\u00a0 but on that\u00a0 of the aggressor.<\/p><p>For the reasons herein before set\u00a0 forth, it is\u00a0 proper, in our opinion, that, with a reversal of the judgment appealed from and the express\u00a0 finding that the\u00a0 defendants are entirely exempt from all liability, Dalmacio Paz and Agripina Mantala should be, and\u00a0 are, hereby acquitted.\u00a0\u00a0 The costs in both instances\u00a0 shall\u00a0 be assessed <em>de oficio<\/em>.\u00a0 So ordered.<\/p><p><em>Mapa, Johnson,\u00a0 Carson,<\/em> and <em>Moreland, JJ<\/em>., concur.<\/p><\/div>",

In the former, as in the present case, the body or bodies of the crime are different and distinct between themselves and for that reason, the\u00a0 allegation of jeopardy alleged by the defense fails of legal foundation.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Upon this plea and the answer thus made to it, the court heard the arguments of the parties and\u00a0 proceeded to\u00a0 a determination\u00a0 of the case.\u00a0\u00a0 While the record fails to disclose that any evidence substantiating the plea\u00a0 of former jeopardy\u00a0 was,\u00a0 technically speaking, introduced, it appears, nevertheless, that everything necessary to present the facts upon which such plea was based was taken for granted and as if it appeared in\u00a0 the case.\u00a0 Moreover, it\u00a0 is\u00a0 seen from the quotation above given of a part of the decision of the lower court that it was expressly stated \"that the record disclosed, and it was admitted as a fact by the fiscal, that the firearm which the defendant is now charged with illegally possessing was possessed by him during the same period and was seized at the same time and\u00a0 place as the arm for the possession of which he was convicted in case No. 1360.\"\u00a0 From all of the facts and circumstances\u00a0 which appear of record in the appeal before us, and particularly, in view of the fact that the plea as presented has not really been traversed by the prosecution, we must presume conclusively that all of the facts which the defendant required to present fully the question\u00a0 of former jeopardy were included in the record\u00a0 and before\u00a0 the court at the time of his\u00a0 decision.<br\/><br\/>After a thorough consideration of the case, the trial court found the plea of the defendant good and dismissed the cause.\u00a0 From the judgment entered on that\u00a0 dismissal the prosecution\u00a0 appealed to this, court.<br\/><br\/>That\u00a0 portion of the statute under which the\u00a0 defendant stands charged which is material to the disposition of the present question reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"SECTION 1. It shall be unlawful for any person,\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 * to possess, or have the<br\/>custody of any\u00a0 shotgun, revolver, pistol\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 or any other deadly weapon from <br\/>which a bullet, ball, shot, shell, or other missile\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 may be discharged by means of gunpowder or other explosive, and it shall be unlawful for any person\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 to acquire, dispose of, or have custody of any ammunition or detached parts for\u00a0 weapons, unless and\u00a0 until such person * \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 shall secure\u00a0 a license\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 and otherwise comply with the requirements of this Act and the rules and regulations issued\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 pursuant to the provisions of this Act.\u00a0 The word \"firearm\" as used herein shall be interpreted to mean any and all of the weapons mentioned in this section.\"<br\/><br\/>\"Sec. 25. Any person having possession of any firearms in violation of any provision of this Act shall\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 be punished by a fine *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 or by imprisonment\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.\"<\/blockquote>The question is squarely presented to\u00a0 us on this appeal whether or hot, under\u00a0 the statute above quoted, the\u00a0 prosecuting officer may, when he finds a person in possession of two or more firearms at the same time and in the\u00a0 same place, proceed against such\u00a0 person\u00a0 in as many separate actions as there are different firearms in his possession.<br\/><br\/>We are confident that that portion of the Philippine Bill embodying the principle that no person shall be twice put in jeopardy of punishment for the same\u00a0 offense\u00a0 should, in accordance with its letter and spirit,\u00a0 be\u00a0 made to cover as nearly as possible every result which\u00a0 flows from a\u00a0 single criminal act impelled by a single criminal intent.\u00a0\u00a0 The fact should not be lost sight of that it is the injury to the public which a criminal action seeks to redress, and by such redress to prevent its repetition, and not the injury to individuals. In so far as a single criminal\u00a0 act,\u00a0 impelled by a single criminal intent, in other words, one volition, is divided into separate crimes and punished accordingly, just so far are the spirit of the Philippine Bill and the provisions of article 89 of the Penal Code violated.<br\/><br\/>In our judgment the possession of the two firearms under the conceded facts of this case constitutes but one criminal act, one volition.\u00a0 Having been punished once for that act, he can. not, under the provisions of the Philippine Bill and of article 89 of the Penal Code, be punished again for the same act.\u00a0 (U.

Simplicio\u00a0 del Rosario\u00a0 presiding, dismissing the\u00a0 complaint upon the merits after trial, without costs.<p>The facts presented to this court are agreed upon by both parties, consisting, in so far as they are material to a\u00a0 decision of the case, in the following:<\/p><p><\/p><blockquote>\"III. That the plaintiff firm for many years past has been and now is\u00a0 engaged in the business of buying and selling at wholesale hemp,\u00a0 both for its own account\u00a0 and\u00a0 on commission.<p><\/p><p>\"IV. That, it is customary to sell hemp in bales which are made by compressing the loose fiber by means of presses, covering two sides of the bale with matting, and fastening it by means of strips of rattan; that the operation of baling hemp is\u00a0 designated among merchants\u00a0 by the word 'prensaje.'<\/p><p>\"V.\u00a0 That in all\u00a0 sales\u00a0 of\u00a0 hemp by the\u00a0 plaintiff firm, whether for its own account or on commission for others, the price\u00a0 is quoted to the buyer at so much per picul, no mention being made\u00a0 of baling; but with the tacit understanding,\u00a0 unless otherwise expressly agreed, that the hemp will be delivered in\u00a0 bales and that, according to the custom prevailing among hemp merchants and dealers in the Philippine Islands, a charge, the\u00a0 amount of which\u00a0 depends upon\u00a0 the\u00a0 then prevailing\u00a0 rate, is\u00a0 to be made against the buyer\u00a0 under the denomination of 'prensaje' That this charge is made in the same manner in all cases, even when the operation\u00a0 of baling was performed by the plaintiff or by its principal Jong before the contract of sale was made. Two specimens of\u00a0 the ordinary form of account used in these operations are hereunto appended, marked Exhibits A and B,\u00a0 respectively, and made a part hereof.<\/p><p>\"VI. That the amount of the charge made against\u00a0 hemp buyers by the plaintiff firm and other sellers of hemp under the denomination of 'prensaje'\u00a0 during the period involved in this litigation was P1.75 per bale; that the average cost of the rattan\u00a0 and matting used on each\u00a0 bale of hemp\u00a0 is fifteen (15) centavos and that the average total cost of baling hemp is one (1) peso per bale.<\/p><p>\"VII. That\u00a0 insurance companies in the\u00a0 Philippine Islands, in estimating the insurable value of hemp always add to the quoted price\u00a0 of same the charge made by the\u00a0 seller under the\u00a0 denomination of 'prensaje.'<\/p><p>\"VIII. That the average weight of a bale of hemp is two (2) piculs (126.5 kilograms).<\/p><p>\"IX. That between the first day of January, 1905, and the 31st day of March, 1910,\u00a0 the plaintiff firm, in accordance with the\u00a0 custom\u00a0 mentioned in paragraph V hereof, collected and received, under the denomination of 'prensaje,' from purchasers of\u00a0 hemp sold by the said firm for its own account, in addition to the price expressly agreed\u00a0 upon for the said hemp, sums aggregating P380,124.35; and between\u00a0 the 1st day\u00a0 of October, 1908, and the 1st day of March, 1910,\u00a0 collected for the account of the owners of hemp sold by\u00a0 the plaintiff firm in Manila on commission, and under the said denomination\u00a0 of 'prensaje' in addition to the price expressly agreed upon\u00a0 for\u00a0 said hemp, sums aggregating P31,080.<\/p><p>\"X.\u00a0 That the plaintiff firm in estimating the amount due it as commissions on sales of\u00a0 hemp made by it for its principals has always based the said\u00a0 amount on the total sum collected from the purchasers of the hemp,\u00a0 including the charge made in each case under the denomination of 'prensaje.'<\/p><p>\"XI. That the plaintiff has always paid to the defendant or to his predecessor in the office of the Collector of Internal Revenue the tax collectible under the provisions of section 139 of Act No. 1189 upon the selling price expressly agreed upon for all hemp sold by the plaintiff firm both for its own account and on commission, but has not, until compelled to do so as hereinafter\u00a0 stated, paid the said tax upon sums received from the purchaser of such hemp under the denomination of 'prensaje.'<\/p><p>\"XII. That on the 29th day of April, 1910, the defendant, acting\u00a0 in his official capacity as Collector\u00a0 of Internal Revenue of the Philippine Islands, made demand in writing upon the plaintiff firm for the payment within the period of five (5) days of the sum of P1,370.68\u00a0 as a tax of one-third of\u00a0 one per cent on the\u00a0 sums of money\u00a0 mentioned in Paragraph IX hereof, and which the said defendant claimed to be entitled to receive,\u00a0 under the provisions of the said section 139 of Act No. 1189, upon the said sums of money so collected from purchasers of hemp under the denomination of 'prensaje.'<\/p><p>\"XIII. That on the 4th day of May, 1910, the plaintiff firm paid to the defendant\u00a0 under\u00a0 protest the said\u00a0 sum of P1,370.69, and on the same date appealed to the\u00a0 defendant as Collector of Internal Revenue, against the ruling by\u00a0 which the plaintiff firm\u00a0 was required to. make\u00a0 said payment,\u00a0 but\u00a0 defendant\u00a0 overruled\u00a0 said\u00a0 protest and\u00a0 adversely decided said appeal, and refused and still refuses to return to plaintiff the said sum\u00a0 of P1,370.68 or any part thereof.<\/p><p>\"XIV, Upon the facts above set forth it is contended by the plaintiff that the tax of Pl,370.68 assessed by the defendant\u00a0 upon\u00a0 the aggregate\u00a0 sum of said charges\u00a0 made against said purchasers of hemp by the plaintiff during the period in question, under the denomination of 'prensaje' as aforesaid, namely, P411,204.35, is illegal upon the ground that the said charge does not constitute a part of the selling price of\u00a0 the hemp, but is a charge made for the service of baling the hemp, and that the plaintiff firm is therefore entitled to recover of the defendant the said sum of P1,370.68 paid to him under protest, together with all interest thereon at the legal rate since its payment, and the costs of this action.\u00a0 <\/p>\"Upon the facts above stated it is\u00a0 the contention of the defendant that the said charge made under the denomination of 'prensaje'\u00a0 is\u00a0 in\u00a0 truth\u00a0 and in fact a part of the gross value of the hemp sold and of its actual selling\u00a0 price, and that therefore the tax imposed by section 139 of Act No. 1189 lawfully accrued on said sums, that the collection thereof was lawfully and properly made and\u00a0 that therefore the\u00a0 plaintiff is not\u00a0 entitled to recover back said sum or any part thereof;\u00a0 and\u00a0 that the defendant should have judgment against plaintiff for his costs.\"<p><\/p><\/blockquote><p>Under these facts we\u00a0 are of the opinion that the\u00a0 judgment of the court below was right.\u00a0 It is one of the stipulations in the statement of facts that it is customary to sell hemp in\u00a0 bales,\u00a0 and that the price quoted in\u00a0 the market for hemp per picul is the price for the hemp baled.\u00a0 The fact is that among large dealers like the plaintiff in this case it is practically impossible\u00a0 to handle hemp without its\u00a0 being baled, and it\u00a0 is admitted by\u00a0 the statement\u00a0 of facts, as well as demonstrated by\u00a0 the documentary proof introduced in the case, that if the\u00a0 plaintiff sold a\u00a0 quantity of\u00a0 hemp it would be the understanding, without words, that\u00a0 such hemp would be delivered in bales, and that the purchase price would include the cost\u00a0 and expense\u00a0 of\u00a0 baling.\u00a0 In other words, it is the fact as stipulated, as well as it would be the fact of necessity,\u00a0 that in all dealings in hemp in the general market the selling price consists of the value of the hemp loose plus the\u00a0 cost and expense of putting it into marketable form.\u00a0\u00a0 In the sales made by the plaintiff, which are\u00a0 the basis of the controversy here, there were no services performed\u00a0 by him for his vendee.\u00a0 There was agreement\u00a0 that services should be performed.\u00a0\u00a0 Indeed, at the time of such sales it was not\u00a0 known by the vendee whether the hemp was\u00a0 then actually baled or not.\u00a0 All that he knew and\u00a0 all that\u00a0 concerned him was that the hemp should be\u00a0 delivered to him baled.\u00a0 He did not\u00a0 ask the plaintiff to perform services for him, nor did the plaintiff agree to do so.\u00a0 The\u00a0 contract\u00a0 was single\u00a0 and consisted solely in the sale and\u00a0 purchase\u00a0 of hemp.\u00a0 The purchaser contracted for nothing else and the vendor agreed to deliver nothing else.<\/p><p>The word \"price\" signifies\u00a0 the sum stipulated\u00a0 as\u00a0 the equivalent of the thing sold\u00a0 and also every incident taken into consideration for\u00a0 the fixing of\u00a0 the price, put to the debit of the vendee and agreed to by him. It is quite possible that the plaintiff,\u00a0 in this\u00a0 case in connection with the hemp which he sold, had himself already\u00a0 paid the additional expense of\u00a0 baling as a part of the\u00a0 purchase price which he paid and that he himself had received the hemp baled from his vendor.\u00a0 It is quite possible also that such vendor of the plaintiff may have rect&amp;ved the same hemp from his vendor in baled form,\u00a0 that he paid the additional cost of baling as a\u00a0 part\u00a0 of the purchase price which he paid.\u00a0 In such case the plaintiff\u00a0 performed no service\u00a0 whatever for his vendee, nor did, the plaintiff's\u00a0 vendor\u00a0 perform any service for him.<\/p><p>The distinction between a contract of sale and one\u00a0 for work, labor, and materials is tested by the inquiry whether the thing transferred is one not in existence and which never\u00a0 would have existed but for the order\u00a0 of the party desiring to acquire it, or a thing which would have existed and been the subject of sale\u00a0 to some\u00a0 other person,\u00a0 even if the order had not been given.\u00a0 (Groves <em>vs<\/em>. Buck, 3 Maule &amp; S., 178; Towers vs. Osborne, 1 Strange, 506; Benjamin on Sales, 90.)\u00a0\u00a0 It is clear that in the case at bar the hemp was in existence in baled form\u00a0 before the agreements of sale were made, or, at least, would\u00a0 have\u00a0 been\u00a0 in existence even if none of the individual sales here in question\u00a0 had been consummated.\u00a0 It\u00a0 would have been baled, nevertheless, for sale to\u00a0 someone else, since, according to the agreed statement of facts,\u00a0 it is customary to sell hemp in bales. When a\u00a0 person stipulates for the\u00a0 future sale of articles which he\u00a0 is habitually making, and which at the\u00a0 time are not made or finished, it is essentially a contract of sale and not a contract for labor.\u00a0\u00a0 It is otherwise when the article is made pursuant\u00a0 to\u00a0 agreement.\u00a0\u00a0 (Lamb<em> vs<\/em>.

Howarth,\u00a0 21\u00a0 Pick., 205.)\u00a0\u00a0 It is also held\u00a0 in that state that a contract for the sale of an article which the\u00a0 vendor\u00a0 in\u00a0 the ordinary course of\u00a0 his business manufactures or procures for the general market, whether the same is on hand at the time or not, is a contract for the sale of goods to which the statute of\u00a0 frauds applies.\u00a0 But if the goods are to be manufactured especially for the purchaser\u00a0 and upon his special\u00a0 order, and not\u00a0 for\u00a0 the general\u00a0 market, the case is not\u00a0 within the statute.\u00a0 (Goddard <em>vs<\/em>.\u00a0 Binney, 115 Mass., 450.)<\/p><p>It is clear to our minds\u00a0 that\u00a0 in the\u00a0 case at\u00a0 bar the baling was performed\u00a0 for the general market and was not something done by\u00a0 plaintiff which was a result\u00a0 of any peculiar\u00a0 wording of the\u00a0 particular\u00a0 contract between him and his vendee.\u00a0\u00a0 It is undoubted that the plaintiff prepared his hemp for the general market.\u00a0\u00a0 This would be necessary. One who exposes goods for sale in the market\u00a0 must have them in marketable form.\u00a0 The hemp in question\u00a0 would not have been\u00a0 in that condition if it had not been baled. The\u00a0 baling, therefore, was nothing peculiar to the contract between\u00a0 the plaintiff and\u00a0 his vendee.\u00a0 It was precisely the same contract that was made by every other seller of hemp, engaged\u00a0 as was the plaintiff,\u00a0 and resulted simply\u00a0 in the transfer of title to goods\u00a0 already prepared for the general market.\u00a0 The method of bookkeeping and\u00a0 form of\u00a0 the account rendered\u00a0 is not controlling\u00a0 as to the nature\u00a0 of the contract\u00a0 made.\u00a0 It is conceded in\u00a0 the case that\u00a0 a separate entry and\u00a0 charge would\u00a0 have been made for\u00a0 the\u00a0 baling even if the plaintiff had\u00a0 not\u00a0 been the one who bated the hemp but, instead, had\u00a0 received it already baled from his vendor.\u00a0 This indicates of necessity that the mere fact of entering a separate item for the baling of the hemp is formal rather than essential and\u00a0 in no sefise indicates in this case the real transaction between the parties.\u00a0 It is indisputable that, if the plaintiff had\u00a0 bought the hemp in question already baled, and that that was the hemp the\u00a0 sale of which formed the\u00a0 subject of this controversy, then the plaintiff would have performed no\u00a0 service for his vendee and could not,\u00a0 therefore,\u00a0 lawfully charge\u00a0 for the rendition of such service.\u00a0 It is, nevertheless, admitted that\u00a0 in spite of that fact he would still have made the double entry in his invoice of sale to such vendee.\u00a0 This demonstrates the nature of the transaction and discloses, as we\u00a0 have already said, that the entry\u00a0 of a separate\u00a0 charge for baling does\u00a0 not accurately describe the transaction between the parties.<\/p><p>Section 139 [Act No. 1189] of the Internal Revenue Law\u00a0 provides that:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"There shall be paid by each merchant and manufacturer a\u00a0 tax at the rate of one-third\u00a0 of one per centum on\u00a0 the gross value in money of all goods, wares and merchandise sold, bartered or exchanged in the Philippine Islands, and that this\u00a0 tax\u00a0 shall be assessed\u00a0 on the actual selling\u00a0 price at which every such merchant or manufacturer disposes of his commodities.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The operation of baling undoubtedly augments the\u00a0 value of the\u00a0 goods.\u00a0\u00a0 We\u00a0 agree that\u00a0 there can be no question that, if the value of the hemp were not augmented to\u00a0 the amount of P1.75 per bale by said operation, the purchaser would not pay that sum.\u00a0 If one buys a bale of hemp at a\u00a0 stipulated price of P20, well knowing that there\u00a0 is an agreement on his part, express or implied, to pay an\u00a0 additional amount of P1.75 for that bale, he considers\u00a0 the bale of hemp\u00a0 worth P21.75.\u00a0 It is\u00a0 agreed, as we\u00a0 have before stated, that hemp is. sold in bales.\u00a0 Therefore, baling is performed before the sale.\u00a0 The purchaser of hemp owes\u00a0 to the seller nothing whatever by reason\u00a0 of\u00a0 their contract except the value of the hemp delivered.\u00a0\u00a0 That value, that\u00a0 sum which the purchaser pays to the vendee, is the true selling price of the hemp, and every item which enters into such price is a part of such\u00a0 selling price.\u00a0\u00a0 By force\u00a0 of the\u00a0 custom prevailing among\u00a0 hemp\u00a0 dealers in the Philippine Islands, a purchaser of hemp in the market, unless he\u00a0 expressly stipulates that it shall be delivered to him in loose form, obligates himself\u00a0 to\u00a0 purchase and pay for baled\u00a0 hemp.\u00a0 Whether or not such\u00a0 agreement is express\u00a0 or implied, whether it is\u00a0 actual or tacit,\u00a0 it has the same force. After such an agreement has once been made by the purchaser, he has no right to insist thereafter that the seller shall furnish him with unbaled hemp.\u00a0 It is undoubted that the vendees, in the sales referred to\u00a0 in the case at bar, would have had no right, after having made their contracts, to insist on the delivery of loose hemp with the\u00a0 purpose in view themselves to perform the\u00a0 baling and\u00a0 thus save 75\u00a0 centavoa\u00a0 per bale.\u00a0 It is unquestioned that the\u00a0 seller, the plaintiff, would have stood upon his original contract of sale, that is, the obligation to deliver baled hemp, and would have forced his vendees to\u00a0 accept baled hemp, he himself retaining among his own profits those which accrued from the process of baling.<\/p><p>We are of the opinion that the judgment appealed from must be\u00a0 affirmed, without special finding as to costs, and it is so ordered.<\/p><p><em>Torres, Mapa, Johnson,<\/em> and <em>Carson, JJ.<\/em>, .concur.<\/p><\/div>",

that there\u00a0 was no\u00a0 incumbrance on\u00a0 the property,\u00a0 nor did any\u00a0 person have\u00a0 any right or\u00a0 interest therein,\u00a0 except the applicant;\u00a0 that it was\u00a0 acquired\u00a0 by\u00a0 being filled in by the municipality\u00a0 in 1893\u00a0 and 1894; and that it was\u00a0 then occupied by the houses\u00a0 of Vicenta\u00a0 Bagay, Victor Cipres, Cirila Almeria, Sinforoso Labajo, Manuel Catalan, Hilaria Opiiio, Dalmacio Agaton, Gervasio Brillantes, Manuel Padilla, Rosa\u00a0 Juson, and Teresa Escorial.\u00a0 The applicant furthermore stated that, in case of the remote possibility of his appl:cation not being admissible under the Land Registration Act,\u00a0 he would, as municipal president, claim the\u00a0 benefits offered by\u00a0 Chapter\u00a0 VI\u00a0 of Act No.\u00a0 926,\u00a0 inasmuch as the municipality had been in possession of the land since\u00a0 1893, had used it for building purposes for the past fifteen years, and\u00a0 the\u00a0 property was\u00a0\u00a0 inclosed\u00a0 on two\u00a0 of its sides by buildings.<br\/><br\/>On June 8, by reason of the summons and publications made in connection with the\u00a0 action taken on\u00a0 the aforementioned\u00a0 application,\u00a0 the\u00a0 Attorney-General\u00a0 appeared in representation\u00a0 of the Director of Lands and opposed the applicant's petition, on the ground that the land in question belonged to the Government of the United States and was under the control of the Government of these Islands, and asked that the registration applied for be denied.<br\/><br\/>The case came to trial on January 18, 1909; the court, in view of\u00a0 the oral\u00a0 evidence adduced by the applicant, rendered judgment by decreeing, after entry of a\u00a0 general default, the adjudication\u00a0 and\u00a0 registration\u00a0 of the property described in the application and plan\u00a0 aforementioned, in favor of the applicant, in conformity with the provisions of Act No, 926.\u00a0 To this judgment the Attorney-General took exception\u00a0 and moved for\u00a0 a new trial on the grounds that the court's findings of fact were openly and manifestly contrary to the weight of the evidence\u00a0 and that the latter did not warrant\u00a0 the conclusions of the judgment, which judgment was contrary to law.\u00a0 This motion was overruled, exception was taken by the Solicitor-General and the proper bill of exceptions having been filed, the same was certified to and forwarded to the clerk of this court.<br\/><br\/>The land sought to be inscribed in the property registry by the municipality of Tacloban, was, prior to 1891-1892, a mangrove swamp which was inundated by\u00a0 the water of a nearby <i>estero,<\/i>\u00a0 although situated\u00a0 within the\u00a0 town proper,\u00a0 and was\u00a0 gradually\u00a0 filled in by\u00a0 order of the\u00a0 said municipality, between\u00a0 the years 1892 and 1894,\u00a0 when it was\u00a0 successively occupied by the houses of several of the residents of\u00a0 Tacloban,\u00a0 as the\u00a0 portions\u00a0 of the\u00a0 land\u00a0 were successively raised m level and freed from the water.<br\/><br\/>Since then, the municipality has exercised control over the said\u00a0 land and found\u00a0 it\u00a0 to\u00a0 its interest to collect rents from those who, without impediment of any kind, occupied it with their dwellings.\u00a0\u00a0 Notwithstanding the\u00a0 effoits and labor expended by the municipality in improving the land for the benefit of the town, by reducing\u00a0 more and more the inundated area, and it is unquestionable that the said land, which\u00a0 was originally a mangrove swamp and was little by little\u00a0 converted\u00a0 into habitable ground, was and is unappropriated land belonging to the State; that it has not been granted or conveyed to any private party, nor to the municipality itself, without which condition it could not be considered as private property.<br\/><br\/>It was not shown that any building belonging to the municipality of Tacloban and intended for the public service was erected on the said land, nor that the property had been conveyed to the aforementioned municipality to form a part of the municipal assets or estate; therefore\u00a0 it can not be considered as\u00a0 one of the patrimonial\u00a0 properties of the municipality, nor entered in\u00a0 the name of the same in the property registry.<br\/><br\/>The mere fact that the municipality of Tacloban continued to charge and collect rents from the persons who built houses upon and occupied portions of the said land, is not proof that the municipality was the proprietor, for, as it had erected thereon no building intended for the service of the pueblo -\u00a0 a circumstance which, had it\u00a0 existed, would have led to the presumption\u00a0 that,\u00a0 in\u00a0 obtaining permission\u00a0 to erect the building, it also obtained\u00a0 a grant, if only an implied one, of the land, from the Government in the name of the State -\u00a0 in order that the said municipality may be deemed to be the owner of the land in question, it\u00a0 must prove that an express grant of the said land, as one of the properties that form a part of its patrimony, was made to it by the Government.<br\/><br\/>The municipality\u00a0 may be,\u00a0 at the most, a usufructuary of the\u00a0 land\u00a0 in\u00a0 question,\u00a0 but not the proprietor thereof having the right to enter the same in the property registry. It is true that the\u00a0 land\u00a0 herein\u00a0 concerned is neither mineral nor forest land, but is comprised within the term of agricultural land; yet the\u00a0 mere\u00a0 occupation of the said property by the municipality\u00a0 during more than ten years immediately preceding the passage\u00a0 of\u00a0 Act No. 926,\u00a0 which went into effect on July 26, 1904,\u00a0 can not serve as a title\u00a0 whereby to acquire the ownership thereof pursuant to the provisions of paragraph\u00a0 6 of section 54 of Act No. 926, inasmuch as, to do so, it is necessary that the municipality shall have an implied or express grant from the Government, without the\u00a0 fulfillment of which requisite it\u00a0 can not\u00a0 be\u00a0 presumed\u00a0 that\u00a0 a municipality\u00a0 owns and holds in good faith realty admittedly belonging to the State, enabling it to convert the\u00a0 same into <i>terreno propio<\/i>\u00a0 so\u00a0 as to form a part of its estate or municipal assets.<br\/><br\/>The benefit granted by section 54 of the said Act, to foster agriculture and increase the wealth of the country, can not be deemed to be granted, according to economic principles, to the municipal\u00a0 corporations which, on account of their special\u00a0 conditions, the\u00a0 idiosyncrasy and character of the functions which they exercise, and because of\u00a0 the administrative mission\u00a0 which they have to\u00a0 fulfill in the name of the Government and at the same time in representation of the people who elected them, can not engage in agriculture and other pursuits, nor\u00a0 can they, attend to the development, cultivation, or administration of agricultural land, and give special attention to other business, proper only\u00a0 for private parties, and other\u00a0 undertakings especially\u00a0 designed\u00a0 for their promotion, without serious\u00a0 detriment to the interests of the community.<br\/><br\/>Finally,\u00a0 it is to\u00a0 be\u00a0 noted that the said land\u00a0 situated within the town, is not common land or pasture land (<i>terreno o dehesa comunal<\/i>),\u00a0 because this\u00a0 class of land was usually laid off\u00a0 outside of\u00a0 the town; it had to be uncultivated land, and was granted for the pasturage\u00a0 of stock and for other needs of the pueblo, in accordance with an express\u00a0 provision of the law.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, it\u00a0 is our\u00a0 opinion\u00a0 that\u00a0 the judgment appealed from\u00a0 should\u00a0 be reversed and the case dismissed, without special finding as to costs.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Johnson, Carson, Moreland, <\/i>and <i>Trent, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><i><br\/>Arellano, C.

These estates, called El Valle and\u00a0 Calipajan, are bounded on the north and\u00a0 east by Government\u00a0 land; on\u00a0 the\u00a0 west by the estero calle Burao, the lake of Bubu, lands of Pedro Ysconben Pablo, and Government land; and on\u00a0 the south by lands of Melchor Salamanca, the barrio\u00a0 of\u00a0 Catanbuan of the pueblo of Santo Domingo, the Talavera River and a branch thereof called\u00a0 Macandule, and by Government land. Said\u00a0 estates have an area of 4,711 hectares, 10 ares, and\u00a0 56.62 centares, and were appraised at P55,003 in the last\u00a0 tax assessment.\u00a0 According to the\u00a0 best of the applicants' knowledge and\u00a0 belief\u00a0 there is no kind of\u00a0 lien upon the same, nor any one who has any right to participation therein, they having acquired said estates partly by\u00a0 purchase and partly by inheritance\u00a0 and with final judgment. Nevertheless, they stated that they had accepted the benefits of subsection 6, section 54,\u00a0 of Act No. 926; as\u00a0 they had possessed and cultivated the estates described for a much greater period than required by said Act,\u00a0 without thereby intending to admit that they acknowledged by implication that the said estates should be considered public land.<\/p><p>In response to the summonses issued,\u00a0 the Attorney-General appeared in\u00a0 the\u00a0 case on behalf of\u00a0 the\u00a0 Director\u00a0 of Lands,\u00a0 stating that legal identification was\u00a0 necessary for the estates named in\u00a0 the title deeds exhibited, with those described in the application and plan, and\u00a0 that if the identity of\u00a0 such estates was not proven, the Government was opposed to the registration sought.<\/p><p>In another communication the\u00a0 Attorney-General\u00a0 represented: That the\u00a0 tracts of land, registration whereof\u00a0 is sought, not included within the metes and bounds set forth in the said title deeds,\u00a0 belong to the Government\u00a0 of the United States under the control of the Insular Government, and in\u00a0 virtue thereof\u00a0 he opposed registration of the said tracts not included within the metes and bounds set forth in said title deeds, and requested that the application\u00a0 be denied,\u00a0 with costs.<\/p><p>After hearing the case and the\u00a0 evidence adduced\u00a0 by the applicants and the opponent, and\u00a0 finding that the affirmations of the applicant's witnesses were openly and directly contrary to those\u00a0 of the Government's witnesses with reference to the boundaries of said estates, some setting very different\u00a0 boundaries from those fixed\u00a0 by others, for the purpose of clearing up doubts, on December 19,\u00a0 1906, the judge directed that a survey of the said estates of El Valle and Calipajan be made by a surveyor of the Court of Land Registration, in\u00a0 order to determine the boundaries set forth by the Government's witnesses and those fixed by the witnesses for the applicants, after notice to the latter\u00a0 and\u00a0 to the other opponents who appeared,\u00a0 ordering that the surveyor render a\u00a0 report regarding the boundaries stated\u00a0 in the resolution; and that after a plan had\u00a0 been made with the details mentioned,\u00a0 due decision would be rendered, the hearing of the case being meanwhile suspended.<\/p><p>In the\u00a0 brief submitted\u00a0 after completion of the\u00a0 survey by\u00a0 the\u00a0 surveyor of the Court of Land Registration, the following summary appears:\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 That the boundaries indicated by the Government's witnesses, Simplicio Reyes and Agapito del Mundo, are not shown\u00a0 on the\u00a0 land by means of plain and permanent marks whereby the property can be identified, for\u00a0 they are\u00a0 merely the windings\u00a0 of paths, which can never be regarded\u00a0 as permanent points\u00a0 because they generally disappear the following\u00a0 season; (2) that the boundaries indicated by the\u00a0 applicants' witnesses are shown on the land by natural marks, permanent and well-defined, as stated in detail on this sheet; (3) that according to the surveyor Tecson, who approved the plan, nearly all the land was under cultivation years ago, and to this he was able to add what he saw\u00a0 personally when he was\u00a0 on\u00a0 the\u00a0 estates, because all the portions along the southern part of the road to Pangasinan,\u00a0 especially those indicated by red\u00a0 ink, are under cultivation\u00a0 and sown in rice,\u00a0 corn, sugar cane, bananas, thick bamboo, and different kinds of vegetables; that along the whole extent to right and left of the road toward the estate house from the place called Hinucay to the interior, where the barrio of Valle was located,\u00a0 he\u00a0 had seen in the fields he crossed unmistakable signs of their having been cultivated\u00a0 at\u00a0 some time,\u00a0 signs consisting\u00a0 of irrigation ditches, dikes, clusters of banana plants,\u00a0 and fruit trees; that when\u00a0 he crossed\u00a0 the land\u00a0 in the stiios of Maniquis, Panagparadajan, Tagaytay, Bayabas,\u00a0 Bulag, Tabaco, Mabolo, and Calavinan to reach the outer boundary of the estate he had to cross dikes and ditches and at the same time observed in\u00a0 different places great tracts of ground\u00a0 that had been plowed over, which he ascribed to abandoned cultivation; (4) that the names of the different\u00a0 <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">sitios <\/span>included within the boundaries indicated by\u00a0 the witnesses of the applicants and of the Government are shown in\u00a0 the plan; (5) that the parcels claimed by\u00a0 various private parties are those entered on the plan in red ink with\u00a0 the name of the claimant and the area according to scale; (6) that all the tracts designated on the plan by the word \"forest\" to a greater or less extent contain\u00a0 large\u00a0 trees,\u00a0 some\u00a0 of which\u00a0 are doubtless timber-trees.<\/p><p>In the hearing of the case held on February 18, 1910, in San Isidro, Nueva Ecija, an agreement was entered into between counsel for the applicants and for the opponents, excluding from the application a tract of land lying south of a line drawn on the last plan, which appears on the third sheet,\u00a0 indicated by the\u00a0 letters A and B,\u00a0 extending from point B in a southerly\u00a0 direction\u00a0 following\u00a0 the course\u00a0 of the Talavera River on one side, and starting from point A in a southerly direction, then extending around the whole perimeter\u00a0 of\u00a0 the plan until it reaches the said Talavera River, in which\u00a0 agreement\u00a0 were\u00a0 included\u00a0 parcels 45, 48 and 49, which were also the subject of opposition by certain private\u00a0 parties.\u00a0\u00a0 Counsel for\u00a0 the\u00a0 Insular\u00a0 Government reserved the\u00a0 right of the Government to intervene with reference to the parcels of land excluded by this agreement from the application, in case the opponents had any claim to make on said\u00a0 parcels.<\/p><p>On March\u00a0 10, 1910, the\u00a0 associate judge of the Court of Land Registration rendered a decision in the case, ordering, after a declaration of general default, adjudication and registration in the name of the applicants Rafael and Ana Romero y Llamas of all the parcels of land described in the plan prepared by the surveyor of the court, appearing at the end of sheet 3 of this record, with the exception of a tract of\u00a0 land in the southern part of\u00a0 said hacienda included between the lines indicated by pencil and by the letters A and B, the Talavera River, and the perimeter of the estate extending\u00a0 from point A in\u00a0 a southerly direction until it reaches said river, and the further exception of the parcels designated by the numbers 45, 48,\u00a0 and 49 in red ink.\u00a0\u00a0 The court ordered the surveyor of the court to prepare a new technical description\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 hacienda after excluding the foregoing parcels, and to determine the area of the part remaining, so that the decree duly to be issued would agree with\u00a0 such\u00a0 technical\u00a0\u00a0 description\u00a0 and\u00a0 area.\u00a0\u00a0 No\u00a0 special award of costs was\u00a0 made,\u00a0 except those\u00a0 incurred\u00a0 by the survey, which were charged to the\u00a0 Insular\u00a0 Government. The Attorney-General excepted to this decision, especially to the judgment regarding the\u00a0 payment of costs incurred by the survey, and asked for a new hearing on this ground. This petition was denied by order of March 31, and excepted to by the appellant, who duly submitted the proper bill of exceptions.<\/p><p>In\u00a0 the judgment appealed from,\u00a0 as\u00a0 well as in the\u00a0 Attorney-General's\u00a0 brief, the applicants' ownership and possession of the rural estates or haciendas called El Valle and Calipajan are acknowledged in such terms that the Government's counsel\u00a0 does not question said applicants' rights to these estates, as he clearly demonstrates\u00a0 in his brief; so the question on appeal is\u00a0 confined to fixing the boundaries and area with relation to their title deeds and\u00a0 the plan of the estates prepared under judicial\u00a0 order\u00a0 by the surveyor of the Court of Land\u00a0 Registration.\u00a0 This court therefore accepts the\u00a0 statement\u00a0 of\u00a0 facts in said\u00a0 decision\u00a0 and holds that the same in the main\u00a0 is in accordance with law and the merits of the case,\u00a0 as will hereinafter be shown.<\/p><p>On the hypothesis that\u00a0 the applicants' right\u00a0 to the land in question is incontrovertible and that only its true area, with\u00a0 boundaries\u00a0 in accordance\u00a0 with their title\u00a0 deeds, remains to be determined, for the proper and equitable settlement of this controversy it must be remembered\u00a0 that in the 491 <em>quinones<\/em>, 12 <em>balitas<\/em>, 10\u00a0 <em>brazas<\/em> and 10 <em>cuartas,<\/em> the total area of the two tracts of land ceded\u00a0 and\u00a0 awarded to Manuel Lopez y\u00a0 Oz, according to Exhibit C, there is\u00a0 not included the area of the tract located in Calipajan ceded to Estanislao Cervigon, who later\u00a0 conveyed his right to this tract to the same Lopez y\u00a0 Oz, since the deed of conveyance, Exhibit D, does\u00a0 not show\u00a0 the area of\u00a0 this latter\u00a0 estate.<\/p><p>Before going\u00a0 further,\u00a0 it becomes necessary\u00a0 to\u00a0 fix\u00a0 the extent of the measure called <em>quinon<\/em>, whereby is determined the area of the two parcels of land ceded in February, 1853, by the <em>Junta Superior Directiva de Hacienda<\/em>\u00a0 to the said Lopez\u00a0 y Oz.\u00a0 This\u00a0 is an important detail, as\u00a0 the only question to be decided\u00a0 herein is the area of the\u00a0 two rural estates belonging to the applicants.<\/p><p>After careful study of the question\u00a0 of the\u00a0 extent of a quinon, we are of the opinion that the <em>quinon<\/em>, mentioned in sheets 1 and 2 of Exhibit C is that formerly well-known in this country as the <em>quinon realengo,<\/em> equivalent to 5 hectares, 77 ares, and\u00a0 55 centares, and not the modern <em>quinon<\/em> of smaller extent, very little known and employed, unless so stipulated between the\u00a0 contracting parties, for commonly and ordinarily when no statement was made in the conveyances and\u00a0 other transactions the Jand measurement presumed to be adopted between the contracting: parties was the <em>quinon\u00a0 realengo<\/em>, with its subdivisions of\u00a0 <em>balitas<\/em> and bmzas.\u00a0\u00a0 Such was the custom followed in this country until by superior decree of the General Government of May 8, 1861, the use of\u00a0 linear measurements, among them\u00a0 the quinon realengo, was prohibited as a result of the introduction into the Islands of the\u00a0 metric system, as may be seen in the note on page 365, volume 5, of the <em>Coleccion Legislativa Ultramarina<\/em> of Rodriguez San Pedro.<\/p><p>In the archives of the old <em>Audiencia Territorial de Manila<\/em>, which continue at\u00a0 the present time as the archives\u00a0 of this court, will be found records containing old documents and land deeds, whose measures of\u00a0 surface\u00a0 are in <em>quinones<\/em> realengos, a measure used in these Islands for many years before the\u00a0 year 1853.\u00a0 As\u00a0 Fray S. Martin states in his book entitled <em>Toblas de Reduccion<\/em>, the\u00a0 <em>quinon realengo<\/em> as a land measure was used in the Philippines without interruption for a period of over two hundred years, with the approval of the <em>Real Audiencia de Manila<\/em> in its decrees and judgments.\u00a0 It is to be noted here that in the said\u00a0 <em>Tablas de Reduccion <\/em>there are cited in support of its statements the book of Eduardo Sanchez Pita entitled <em>El Consultor del sistema metrico decimal<\/em>; and the opinion\u00a0 of an old sailor, Don Jose Antonio Vico, who is said to have been for many years superintendent\u00a0 of the Manila Nautical School, in so far as it asserts that for the measurement of arable lands the inhabitants of\u00a0 Manila take as unit the <em>braza de ciudad<\/em> or <em> braza realenga.<\/em><\/p><p>On pages 143 and 144 of the first sheet appears a certificate issued by a licensed surveyor\u00a0 at the request of a predecessor\u00a0 of the\u00a0 applicants\u00a0 on\u00a0 September\u00a0 23,\u00a0 1881, wherein, after giving the area of the estate in question and its equivalent, it is stated that it should be noted that the quinones\u00a0 mentioned in the said\u00a0 title\u00a0 deeds, if calculated according to the old measurement wherein the brazas used were realengas, and if they were\u00a0 of 23 octavo? or of three complete\u00a0 <em>Burgos\u00a0 varas,<\/em> according to\u00a0 the custom of each province,\u00a0 an increase of extent almost double would result in favor of said haciendas, which is probable, especially as the official rate of 40,000 <em>varas<\/em> to the <em>quinon<\/em> dates only from the year 1862.\u00a0\u00a0 The licensed surveyor's statement in said certificate is not cited as an authoritative opinion in the case but only to show the measure customarily used among the inhabitants of this country up to the year 1861.<\/p><p>If then the\u00a0 area of the rural estate called Calipajan\u00a0 is not fixed in its old title deed, nor is included in the total of the area of the rural\u00a0 estate called El\u00a0 Valle,\u00a0 amounting to 492 <em>quinones<\/em>, which must according to\u00a0 the references given be in our opinion\u00a0 <em>realengos<\/em>, with 2 <em>balitas<\/em>, 10 <em>brazas,<\/em> and 10\u00a0 <em>cuartas<\/em> over, equivalent, at the rate of\u00a0 5 hectares, 77 ares, and 65 centares, to an extent of 2,840 hectares, it will be immediately understood how in the application for registration\u00a0 the area\u00a0 of the two estates\u00a0 together\u00a0 appears to amount to 4,711 hectares, 10 ares, and\u00a0 56.62 centares, with a difference of over 1,871 hectares and\u00a0 a fraction,\u00a0 which must be the area of the Calipajan\u00a0 estate that the applicants have likewise continued to hold with good title.<\/p><p>In the plan\u00a0 prepared by the surveyor of the\u00a0 Court of Land Registration by\u00a0 judicial order\u00a0 it likewise\u00a0 appears that the area\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 whole tract, or\u00a0 of the two\u00a0 estates together, amounts\u00a0 to 5,676 hectares and 98 ares, much more than the 4,711 hectares and a fraction stated in the application for registration; but this great difference is explained as resulting from the agreement entered into by the parties on\u00a0 February\u00a0 18,\u00a0 1910,\u00a0 before the decision in the\u00a0 case, whereby the applicants excluded from their application for registration the tract of land situated to the south of the estate and fixed in the articles of agreement, with reference to the\u00a0 said plan, and therefore counsel for the private opponents withdrew the objection they had made, thus leaving counsel for\u00a0 the Insular Government the only opponent in the case.<\/p><p>From\u00a0 the foregoing\u00a0 it appears\u00a0 that the\u00a0 case\u00a0 presents no question\u00a0 of\u00a0 right to be settled and that the controversy between\u00a0 the parties is reduced solely to the question as to whether the area indicated in the application is that which the estates called El Valle and Calipajan really ought to have, according to the boundaries fixed in the plan prepared by the court surveyor, with the exception of the large tract of land excluded in the agreement entered\u00a0 into\u00a0 between the applicants and the private opponents.<\/p><p>After weighing the\u00a0 evidence adduced\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 case\u00a0 and considering the report of the surveyor of the court explaining the reasons and motives\u00a0 which, after examining the land, enabled him to fix the boundaries of the two estates, indicated in\u00a0 the plan prepared for that purpose, the judge held to be proved by the applicants the boundaries, extent and identity of their two estates as they are indicated in the plan prepared by said surveyor, accepting therefor the testimony of the witnesses presented by said\u00a0 applicants, to the effect that the boundaries indicated by them, which were admitted\u00a0 by said\u00a0 surveyor,\u00a0 consist of\u00a0 permanent marks,\u00a0 being for the most part very old trees.\u00a0 It is to be noted that, as asserted\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 appellee's\u00a0 brief,\u00a0 when\u00a0 the surveyor\u00a0 proceeded to examine the land\u00a0 and to survey it he was accompanied by an employee of the Government and\u00a0 still it does not appear in the record that counsel\u00a0 for the Government or the Bureau of Lands has entered any statement or protest against the surveyor's action nor has it duly questioned the report made by him, or the accuracy of the plan.\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore there appears no satisfactory reason to prevent the acceptance of the judgment formed by the court in this case.<\/p><p>For the rest of this case, the possession seems to be plainly justified\u00a0 whereby the applicants enjoy by lawful title the ownership of the two rural estates in question'; and not only is the ownership\u00a0 they exercise thereto proven, but said estates are also identified in due form and in accordance with the Land Registration Act.<\/p><p>For these reasons and in the absence of v legal obligation on the part of the Insular Government to pay all the\u00a0 costs incurred\u00a0 by the survey of the lands and preparation of the new plan by the court surveyor, it is proper in our opinion to affirm the judgment appealed from, without special award of costs in the case, each\u00a0 party assuming half of those incurred by the examination,\u00a0 survey and preparation of the new plan made by the court surveyor, to which extent the last point of said judgment is modified.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<\/p><p><em> Mapa, Johnson, Carson,<\/em> and <em>Moreland, JJ.<\/em>, concur.<\/p><\/div>",

CHO JAN LING ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br\/>\n<br\/>\nD E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>CARSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">After a careful examination of the\u00a0 evidence of record in this case we are satisfied that the material findings of fact by the trial court are fully sustained thereby, and that upon the facts as proven that court\u00a0 properly\u00a0 granted the relief afforded by the decree from which this appeal\u00a0 was taken.<br\/><br\/>From the facts proven at the trial it appears that a number of Chinese merchants raised a fund by voluntary subscription with which they purchased a valuable tract of land and erected a large building to\u00a0 be used as\u00a0 a\u00a0 sort of club house for the mutual benefit of the subscribers\u00a0 to the fund.\u00a0 The subscribers organized themselves into an irregular association, which had no regular articles of association, and was not incorporated or registered\u00a0 in the\u00a0 commercial registry or elsewhere.\u00a0 The association\u00a0 not having any existence as a legal entity, it was agreed to have the title to the property placed in the name of one of the members, the defendant,\u00a0 Cho Jan Ling,\u00a0 who on his part accepted the trust, and agreed to hold\u00a0 the property as the agent of the members of the\u00a0 association.\u00a0 After the club building was completed with the funds of the members\u00a0 of the association, Cho Jan Ling collected\u00a0 sotfie \u00a5=25,000 in\u00a0 rents\u00a0 for which he failed and\u00a0 refused to account, and upon proceedings being instituted to compel him to do\u00a0 so, he set up title\u00a0 in himself to the club property as well as to the rents accruing therefrom, falsely alleging that he had\u00a0 bought the real\u00a0 estate and constructed the building with his own funds, and denying the claims\u00a0 of the\u00a0 members of the association that it was their funds which had been used for that purpose.<br\/><br\/>The decree of the trial court provides for the conveyance of the club house and the land on which it stands from the defendant, Cho Jan Ling, in whose name it is registered, to the members of the\u00a0 association, and further makes provision for an accounting by him for rents had and received,<br\/><br\/>Accepting the truth of the above-set-out summary of the facts proven at the trial, we think appellants' assignments of error are entitled to but\u00a0 scant consideration, in so far as they are based on alleged abuses of discretion by the trial court in improvidently appointing a receiver pending these proceedings,\u00a0 and in permitting amendments to the original complaint, chiefly for the purpose of bringing in the proper parties to this\u00a0 action.\u00a0\u00a0 Even\u00a0 if\u00a0 it be\u00a0 admitted\u00a0 that the court erred in appointing a receiver\u00a0 at the institution of these proceedings and in retaining him after he had\u00a0 been appointed, this\u00a0 alleged\u00a0 error\u00a0 in\u00a0 no wise affected the real merits of the case; and in the light of the facts set out above it will hardly be contended that the appellants have suffered any\u00a0 damage\u00a0 for which\u00a0 they\u00a0 should\u00a0 have redress, merely because, during the pendency\u00a0 of this action and\u00a0 without awaiting the final decree compelling them to disgorge, the court took under its own guardian care certain funds and property which they unjustly sought to retain,\u00a0 although its retention by them involved a flagrant breach of trust on their\u00a0 part.\u00a0 So, too, even if we\u00a0 were to admit, which we do not, that the\u00a0 trial judge was too liberal in his allowance of amendments\u00a0 to the\u00a0 complaint filed in this proceeding, we are nevertheless unable to see that any real or substantial right of the appellants was prejudiced thereby.\u00a0 Due, doubtless, to the inherent difficulties which must be anticipated in the conduct of a case wherein a large number of the parties are Chinese persons, unable to\u00a0 speak\u00a0 any tongue but their own, some formal or technical irregularities seem to have crept\u00a0 into the proceedings in the court below and an unusually large number of amendments of the pleadings appear to have been necessary\u00a0 for the proper development of the\u00a0\u00a0 facts and in order to bring: in all the parties interested, but none of these irregularities or amendments\u00a0 in\u00a0 any wise prejudiced the defense set up by the appellants in the court below,\u00a0 and assignments of error based\u00a0 thereon can not be sustained under section 503 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which\u00a0 provides that \"No judgment shall be reversed on\u00a0 formal or technical grounds, or for such error as has not prejudiced the real rights of the excepting party.\"<br\/><br\/>Accepting, as we\u00a0 do, the truth and accuracy of the facts found by the trial\u00a0 court there can be no\u00a0 shadow of doubt that the plaintiffs are entitled to the relief furnished them by the\u00a0 decree.\u00a0 The attempt on the part of the\u00a0 appellants to escape the logical and\u00a0 manifestly just consequences of the conclusions of facts set out in the opinion of the trial judge by pointing this court to the doctrine laid down in its\u00a0 decisions in the\u00a0 case of Martinez <i>vs.<\/i> Martinez (1 Phil. Rep., 647)\u00a0 and the\u00a0 case of Compania General de Tabacos <i> vs<\/i>. Topino (4 Phil. Rep. 33), can not and should not succeed. It is at most an attempt to substitute for the plain dictates of reason and\u00a0 equity certain technical propositions of law laid down in those\u00a0 cases which\u00a0 have no proper application to the facts proven\u00a0 in this case.\u00a0\u00a0 The Martinez case turned on the lack\u00a0 of\u00a0 proof of tne existence of the relationship of principal and agent or of trustee and cestui que trust between the parties,\u00a0 in addition to proof that the funds with\u00a0 which the property was purchased had been furnished by another than\u00a0 him who secured its\u00a0 registry\u00a0 in\u00a0 his own name.\u00a0\u00a0 In the case at bar we think that the evidence clearly discloses not only that the funds with which the property in question was\u00a0 purchased were furnished by the members of the association, but that\u00a0 Cho Jan Ling, in whose name\u00a0 it was registered, received and holds the property as the\u00a0 agent and trustee\u00a0 of the association; that on at least one occasion\u00a0 he admitted the beneficial ownership to be in the association; and that while the legal registered title is in his name the beneficial\u00a0 ownership is\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 association.\u00a0 Nor has the doctrine laid down\u00a0 in the\u00a0 Topifio case any direct bearing upon\u00a0 the facts proven\u00a0 and the\u00a0 relief sought and granted in this case.\u00a0 The Topifio case turned on the determination of the question of the legal title of the grantor of the conveyance\u00a0 inscribed\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 land\u00a0 registry,\u00a0 and the\u00a0 further question\u00a0 of the right of the holder of a duly registered title to be secured in his right of possession\u00a0 as against third persons who do not claim through him,\u00a0 until and unless the inscription of his title has been judicially canceled.\u00a0\u00a0 In the case at bar the legal title of the holder of the registered title is not questioned; it is admitted that the members of the association voluntarily\u00a0 obtained the inscription in\u00a0 the name\u00a0 of Cho Jan Ling and that they have no right to have that inscription canceled; they do not seek such cancellation, and on the\u00a0 contrary they allege\u00a0 and prove that the duly registered legal title to the property is in Cho Jan Ling, but they maintain,\u00a0 and we think that they\u00a0 rightly maintain, that he holds it under an obligation, both express and implied, to deal with\u00a0 it exclusively tor the benefit of the members of the association and subject to their will.<br\/><br\/>Without prejudice to the filing of a more extended opinion hereafter by any of the members of the court, if it be deemed advisable or necessary so to do, the decree entered by the court below should be affirmed with the costs of this instance against the appellants.\u00a0 It is so ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

She maintains that her husband, Teodoro Lanzuela\u00a0 Santos, acquired\u00a0 it by absolute purchase.\u00a0 The opposing party, on the other hand, maintains that the land has never belonged to Teodoro Lanzuela Santos, nor to any of his heirs; that it has\u00a0 been in her possession for the past ten years and was\u00a0 in possession of her aunt, Paulina Lorenzo, before the latter's death.<\/p><p>\"As\u00a0 shown by the evidence adduced by both parties, especially by the applicant with the document (L.\u00a0 D. 9679), presented by her,\u00a0 the land\u00a0 has\u00a0 always been in possession of Paulina Lorenzo, who, since the year 1871 has been paying to Teodoro de los Santos at first, then to Jose L.\u00a0 Santos, one\u00a0 of his\u00a0 sons, and later\u00a0 from the\u00a0 year\u00a0 1890\u00a0 on\u00a0 to Estefania Evangelista, a fixed amount, sometimes in money and\u00a0 sometimes in products, which\u00a0 has been\u00a0 delivered to them as interest on a sum received, for which\u00a0 the land was pledged as security.\u00a0\u00a0 In proof thereof, it was made to appear in the receipt issued by Estefania Evangelista on June 9, 1896, acknowledging receipt by her of the sum of $13.50, that it was in\u00a0 the nature of payment for the use of land of Paulina Lorenzo, although it appears from the testimony of her own son, Isabelo L. Santos, that she obtained under the\u00a0 past sovereignty over twenty titles issued by the late Spanish Government to more than 100 parcels and yet it has\u00a0 not\u00a0 been shown that the land in litigation was included in the application presented therefor.<\/p><p>\"Narcisa Lorenzo's objection is sustained, and the application made with reference to the first parcel is denied.<\/p><p>\"As it is proven that the other two parcels have been in undisputed possession of the applicant for more than thirty years, it is hereby ordered, after declaration of general default, that the same be registered in the name of Estefania Evangelista.\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"After this decision\u00a0 has become final and the procedure provided in section 66 of Act No. 926, applicable to the case at bar, has been carried out, let the order be issued.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The applicant appealed from this judgment in so far as it sustains the objection and consequently denies registration in her name of the first parcel described in the application.<\/p><p>There is no question about the\u00a0 opponents' possession.\u00a0 It is an established fact, admitted by the applicant herself, that the land which is the subject of the objection, was held in life\u00a0 by Paulina\u00a0 Lorenzo, whom they upon her death succeeded as her heirs in possession of said land,\u00a0 which they hold and keep\u00a0 at present.\u00a0 The\u00a0 question is confined to determining the title upon which the opponents' possession is based, for they claim to\u00a0 be the lawful owners, as was their predecessor in interest, Paulina Lorenzo, of the land in litigation,\u00a0 while the applicant avers that the latter's possession, and consequently the possession of the opponents, as her successors\u00a0 in interest, was and\u00a0 is solely as tenants of the applicant herself.<\/p><p>The oral evidence adduced in the case\u00a0 is plainly contradictory, each side supporting its own claim, so the question must be\u00a0 decided\u00a0 principally by the documentary evidence Submitted.\u00a0\u00a0 This consists of twenty-two receipts for annual payments made by Paulina Lorenzo, some in rice and some in money, first to Teodoro\u00a0 de los Santos, the applicant's husband; later, to Jose Santos, his son; and to the applicant herself since the year 1890.\u00a0\u00a0 These receipts were apparently preserved by the opponents and were presented as evidence in a suit for recovery of possession waged between themselves and the applicant, whence\u00a0 is taken a certified copy, which appears in the record of this case.\u00a0 They are made out in the Tagalog dialect, and all of them invariably refer to the\u00a0 payment\u00a0 made by Paulina Lorenzo\u00a0 as <em>buis.<\/em>\u00a0 The parties disagree as to the particular meaning of this word, used in the receipts.\u00a0 The applicant maintains that it means <em>land rent or payment for lease of land.<\/em>\u00a0\u00a0 According to the opponents, it means interest on money.\u00a0 The opponents' contention, accepted as correct in the\u00a0 judgment appealed from, is that Paulina Lorenzo secured from the applicant or from her husband, Teodoro de los Santos, the sum of two hundred pesos as a loan, on condition of paying annual interest of twenty pesos, and that the word <em>buis<\/em> used in the receipts refers to that interest on the\u00a0 loan.<\/p><p>To settle\u00a0 the\u00a0 question here raised we have consulted several dictionaries of the Tagalog dialect,\u00a0 which in our opinion clearly sustain the\u00a0 applicant's contention.\u00a0 Thus, for example,\u00a0 Noceda\u00a0 and Sanlucar's\u00a0 \"Vocabulary of the Tagalog Language,\" printed at Manila in 1860, gives the following: \"<em>Bovis:<\/em>\u00a0 To pay land rent.\"\u00a0 And in the Spanish Tagalog Dictionary of Don Pedro\u00a0 Serrano Lactaw, printed in 1889, appears: \"<em>Canon: Buis nang lupa<\/em>.\"\u00a0 So, according to this, the Tagalog word buis properly means canon or land rent, and\u00a0 in our opinion\u00a0 this\u00a0 is the definite meaning it has in\u00a0 the receipts mentioned above.\u00a0\u00a0 This\u00a0 is proven by the fact that in the receipt of May 22, 1893,\u00a0 said word\u00a0 is expressly\u00a0 associated with another Tagalog word, <em>lupa<\/em>, which means earth\u00a0 or land; and in\u00a0 the receipts of June 9,\u00a0 1896; May 30, 1897; and July 14,\u00a0 1898, with the Tagalog word <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">buquid,<\/span> which means a piece of <em>arable ground<\/em>.\u00a0\u00a0 This would remain\u00a0 unexplained by the contention that the word bids in the receipts means interest\u00a0 on\u00a0 a loan, because in such case mention would have been made of the alleged loan, and not of the land or piece of arable ground, to characterize or determine the particular meaning of that word.<\/p><p>It is stated in the judgment appealed from that the alleged loan of 200 pesos to the applicant was secured by the land in question, and in the opponents' brief a slight encumbrance (sic) on said land is also hinted at.\u00a0 If this were true, it might to some extent, though not satisfactorily throughout, explain why mention is made of the land\u00a0 in the receipts under consideration; but the opponent, Narcisa Lorenzo, states positively in her testimony\u00a0 that the\u00a0 said land <em>was never encumbered<\/em> for the sum which the applicant lent to Paulina Lorenzo.\u00a0 If this were true and said land had no connection with that\u00a0 alleged loan, it would be wholly inexplicable why the land was mentioned in the receipts, supposing that the latter refer, as the opponents contend, to the interest on\u00a0 such a loan.<\/p><p>Moreover, there is evidence that the opponents themselves have\u00a0 understood, or understand, that the word buis\u00a0 means in the receipts canon\u00a0 or land rent.\u00a0 This is beyond dispute, at least in the last four receipts.\u00a0 Otherwise,\u00a0 note the testimony of the opponent, Narcisa Lorenzo: \"I\u00a0 called her attention to the fact that those receipts were different from the preceding ones, because in that same receipt she appears to have made <em>collection of rent<\/em>, but\u00a0 she (Estefania Evangelista) told me that she merely made the receipt out in that manner because collection of interest on sums borrowed is prohibited.\"\u00a0 This\u00a0 demonstrates conclusively that in\u00a0 the opponent's own mind\u00a0 the receipts, as they stand, show payment of <em>canon <\/em>or land rent and not interest on money.<\/p><p>This settled,\u00a0 it is superfluous to add that the phrase <em>her land <\/em>(Paulina Lorenzo's),\u00a0 used in\u00a0 the receipt of June 9, 1896, does not\u00a0 strictly mean, as held in the\u00a0 judgment\u00a0 appealed from, that such land\u00a0 belongs\u00a0 to her, but that she possesses or holds it\u00a0 in the manner stated\u00a0 in the receipt itself, which is determined by the use therein of the word buis (land rent).\u00a0 This word demonstrates beyond all doubt that Paulina was a mere tenant on the land, because it would be absurd to suppose\u00a0 that she would pay rent for her own land.\u00a0 That this is the real meaning of the phrase quoted is proven by the receipts of the years 1893 and 1898, wherein particular mention is made of a parcel of land belonging to the applicant,\u00a0 which the opponents' predecessor\u00a0 in\u00a0 interest, Paulina Lorenzo, held on lease.<\/p><p>It is true that the opponent, Narcisa Lorenzo, testified that she called the applicant's\u00a0 attention to the inaccuracy in making\u00a0 out the receipts in that way;\u00a0 but this testimony, entirely\u00a0 uncorroborated in the case, is offset by the very fact of the existence of said receipts made out in the terms above set forth; for it would,\u00a0 moreover,\u00a0 be unlikely that the opponents would have preserved them for so many years and exhibited them as evidence in\u00a0 another previous suit, in the way they are made out,\u00a0 if they\u00a0 contained\u00a0 anything incorrect or inaccurate which would prejudice their own rights or interests.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 natural thing in\u00a0 this case was not to accept the receipts,\u00a0 and if they had been accepted through\u00a0 inadvertence or neglect, to secure their proper correction, instead of merely calling attention to\u00a0 them, as the opponent\u00a0 Lorenzo asserts in her testimony.\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, it\u00a0 does not appear at all\u00a0 logical that it would be she, and not\u00a0 Paulina Lorenzo,\u00a0 who would\u00a0 call the\u00a0 applicant's attention to this point, as\u00a0 the\u00a0 receipts\u00a0 appear to be made out in the latter's favor, unless said applicant's name figured therein to no purpose.<\/p><p>In any event, this phase of the question becomes absolutely lacking in importance just as\u00a0 soon as\u00a0 we reach\u00a0 the conclusion that the\u00a0 word <em>buis,<\/em>\u00a0 employed in the other receipts, and not disputed by\u00a0 the opponents, means that their predecessor in interest, Paulina Lorenzo, possessed the land in litigation merely on lease.<\/p><p>The judgment appealed from is hereby reversed and it is ordered that said land be registered in the name of the applicant, Estefania Evangelista; without special finding\u00a0 as to costs,<\/p><p><em>Torres, Johnson, Carson<\/em>, and <em>Moreland,\u00a0 JJ.,<\/em> concur.<\/p><\/div>",

In\u00a0 the present action,, however, the plaintiff made defendants Braulio Montelibano,\u00a0 as tutor of said minor children, Rosario,\u00a0 Raymundo,\u00a0 and Bibiana.\u00a0 The record\u00a0 does not\u00a0 show why Maria was not made a party defendant.\u00a0 Until the contrary is shown, each of these heirs has an\u00a0 equal\u00a0 interest\u00a0 in the property in question.<br\/><br\/>\"It would seem clear that\u00a0 the present action could not be concluded without having all of the heirs in court.<br\/><center><br\/>*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><\/center> <br\/>\"For\u00a0 the reason, therefore, that all of the\u00a0 heirs of the said Aniceto\u00a0 Montelibano were not made parties in\u00a0 the present action, the judgment of the lower court\u00a0 is hereby revoked and the\u00a0 cause is hereby remanded\u00a0 to the\u00a0 lower court, with permission on the part of the plaintiff to amend his complaint.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>(See also Sanidad <i>vs<\/i>.

We\u00a0 believe,\u00a0 however, that, for\u00a0 the information of the parties interested in the subject matter of this action and to the\u00a0 end\u00a0 that\u00a0 unnecessary litigation may be avoided, the opinion of the court should be\u00a0 given upon the facts presented in this case.\u00a0 Knowing what our opinion is upon these facts it is probable\u00a0 that\u00a0 the\u00a0 heirs\u00a0 will\u00a0 not care to\u00a0 pursue the litigation further unless, which is somewhat unlikely, they are able to present hew facts.\u00a0 We, therefore, proceed to a consideration of the case upon the merits as\u00a0 presented by the record.<br\/><br\/>The defendants hope\u00a0 to succeed upon each one of\u00a0 two grounds, asserting\u00a0 (1) that the action has prescribed,\u00a0 and (2) that .the said cause of action has been the subject matter of a prior final adjudication\u00a0 between the same parties.<br\/><br\/>We do not find it necessary to discuss or decide the second question presented by the appellees, inasmuch as the cause must be resolved in their favor upon the ground first stated.<br\/><br\/>That the instrument in question upon\u00a0 which this action is brought is a commercial instrument is indubitably established by this court in the case of El Banco Espanol-Filipino <i>vs.<\/i> Tan-Tongco\u00a0 (13 .Phil.\u00a0 Rep.,\u00a0 628).\u00a0\u00a0 In\u00a0 that\u00a0 case the promissory note\u00a0 read as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Three months from this date I hereby promise to pay, in Manila, to the order of\u00a0 D. Geronimo\u00a0 Jose, the sum of three thousand six hundred pesos, Mexican currency, value received in cash for commercial transactions.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In deciding that case the\u00a0 court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"<i>Mercantile promissory notes<\/i>. - Neither the literal reading of article 532 of the Code of\u00a0 Commerce,\u00a0 nor the principles governing\u00a0 the mercantile law now in\u00a0 force, require that a promissory note, payable to order,\u00a0 be made between merchants, in order that said note\u00a0 may be a mercantile one, as is required by said article 532 in connection with drafts.<br\/><br\/>\"<i>Id.<\/i> - The law does not require that promissory notes, in order that they may be\u00a0 indorsed and\u00a0 that the indorsement may be valid, the same as that of a bill of exchange, must be made between merchants,\u00a0 especially if\u00a0 the\u00a0 said notes arise from\u00a0 a mercantile loan, in which case it is only required that one of the contractors be a merchant, according to article 311 (Code of Commerce).<br\/><br\/>\"<i>Id<\/i>. - A promissory note arising from a mercantile loan, according to its literal reading and the principles of the Code\" of Commerce, where the same is drawn to order, is perpetually negotiable,\u00a0 transferable,\u00a0 and strictly mercantile, no other expression being necessary for the purpose of showing that it\u00a0 arises from a commercial transaction within\u00a0 the meaning of article 532.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Section 38 of the Code of Civil Procedure reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"<i>To what this chapter does not apply<\/i>. - This chapter shall not apply to actions already commenced, or to cases wherein the right of action has already accrued; but the statutes in force when\u00a0 the action or right of action\u00a0 accrued shall be applicable to such cases according to the subject of the action and without regard to the form; nor shall this chapter apply in the case of a continuing and subsisting trust\/ nor to an action by the vendee of real property in possession thereof to obtain the conveyance of it:\u00a0 Provided, nevertheless, That all rights of action which have already accrued, except those\u00a0 named in the last preceding\u00a0 paragraph, must\u00a0 be vindicated by the commencement of an action or proceeding to enforce the\u00a0 same within ten\u00a0 years\u00a0 after this Act comes into effect.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>This court has held in numerous cases\u00a0 that the prescription of a cause of action arising before\u00a0 the Code of Civil Procedure waa operative\u00a0 is governed\u00a0 by\u00a0 the laws in force at the time the cause of action arose.\u00a0\u00a0 (Falacio <i>vs. <\/i>Sudario, 7 Phil, Rep., 275; Tubucon<i> vs<\/i>.

Garrido, 6 Phil. Rep., 137.)\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It is evident, therefore, that\u00a0 whether\u00a0 or not the action in the case at bar has prescribed depends\u00a0 not upon the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure\u00a0 but upon the laws in force prior to the time said code\u00a0 became effective; and inasmuch as the instrument forming the\u00a0 basis of the present cause of action is a commercial instrument, it is\u00a0 governed by the provisions of the Commercial Code and not by those of the Civil Code.<br\/><br\/>Article 950 of the Commercial\u00a0 Code\u00a0 reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Actions arising from drafts shall extinguish three years after they have fallen due, should they have been protested or not.<br\/><br\/>\"A similar rule shall be applied to drafts and promissory notes of commerce, to checks, stubs, and other instruments of draft or exchange, and to the dividends, coupons, and the amounts of the amortization of obligations issued in accordance with this code.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The instrument in question being dated the 9th of June, 1897, and payable twelve months after date, it would fall due on the 9th day of June, 1898.\u00a0 As a result the right to bring an action upon it prescribed on the 9th day of June, 1901.\u00a0 This action was commenced on the 1st day\u00a0 of December,\u00a0 1908.<br\/><br\/>To avoid the results which\u00a0 would inevitably follow from these facts,\u00a0 the plaintiff alleges that the defendant has always recognized the debt in question as alive and in force and that he particularly did so in the year 1907 under the following circumstances:\u00a0 In that year the plaintiff in this case began an action against the defendant in this case for the recovery of the amount due upon the same promissory note which is\u00a0 the\u00a0 basis of the present action.\u00a0 During the progress of that action in\u00a0 court, and, as it appears from the record of that action introduced in evidence in\u00a0 this case, immediately after said action had been\u00a0 commenced,\u00a0 the defendant by a writing offered to secure the debt in question by turning over to the plaintiff in that action, also plaintiff' in this, certain lands belonging to him, with the right to repurchase within four years.<br\/><br\/>This act of\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant is seized upon by the plaintiff as showing a recognition of the existence of the debt under article 1973 of the Civil Code, which provides that - <br\/><blockquote>\"Prescription of actions is interrupted by their institution before the courts, by extrajudicial claim of the creditor, and by any act of\u00a0 acknowledgment of the debt by the debtor.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>And under\u00a0 article 944\u00a0 of the Commercial Code,\u00a0 which provides that -<br\/><blockquote>\"The\u00a0 prescription shall be\u00a0 interrupted\u00a0 through suit or any judicial proceeding brought against the debtor, through the acknowledgment of the\u00a0 obligations,\u00a0 or\u00a0 through the renewal of the instrument on which the right of the creditor is based.\"<\/blockquote>There might possibly be\u00a0 some legal\u00a0 basis for the. contention of the plaintiff that the act of the defendant, above mentioned, during the pendency of the prior action, brought the case within the provisions of the above-named articles, if\u00a0 it\u00a0 did\u00a0 not conclusively\u00a0 appear in the record that such act of the defendant was\u00a0 for the purpose\u00a0 of settling and compromising\u00a0 said action.\u00a0\u00a0 It clearly appearing that the said act was executed solely for the purpose of compromising a pending litigation, it is\u00a0 not an admission that anything was due and can not be used as evidence against\u00a0 the defendant.\u00a0 Section 346 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"<i>Offer\u00a0 of\u00a0 compromise<\/i>. - An offer of compromise is not an admission that\u00a0 anything is due, and is not admissible in\u00a0 evidence.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In the case of City of Manila <i>vs. <\/i>Del Rosario (5 Phil. Rep., 227), the court said (pp. 229-230):<br\/><blockquote>\"He stated that he signed the second document because the president of the municipal board,\u00a0 Sr. Herrera, advised him to do so in order to avoid litigation with the city.\u00a0 His testimony in this respect was not\u00a0 contradicted.\u00a0\u00a0 We accordingly hold that the provisions of section 346 of the Code of Civil\u00a0 Procedure are applicable to the case at bar in so far as they declare that <i>an offer of compromise is not admissible in evidence.\"<\/i><\/blockquote>While the evidence as to whether or\u00a0 not the document tendered by\u00a0 the defendant to the plaintiff as security for the payment of the\u00a0 debt in question was a recognition\u00a0 of the debt or an offer of compromise is somewhat\u00a0 conflicting, we have no\u00a0 hesitation in finding, upon\u00a0 the facts, that it was an offer of compromise.\u00a0 Testimony offered for the purpose of showing such a recognition of a debt that has been\u00a0 quieted by the statute of\u00a0 limitations\u00a0 as\u00a0 imports a new promise to pay, must be clear and explicit.\u00a0\u00a0 In the case of\u00a0 Bell <i>vs. <\/i>Morrison (1 Peters, 351), Mr.\u00a0 Justice Story fully discussed the subject, and after dealing with the importance of giving\u00a0 the statute of limitations such support as to\u00a0 make it \"what it was intended to be, emphatically, a statute of repose.' and\u00a0 \"not\u00a0 designed\u00a0 merely to raise a presumption of payment of a just debt from lapse of time;\" and, repeating passages from\u00a0 the\u00a0 opinions in Clementson <i>vs,<\/i> Williams (8 Cranch., 72) and Wetzell <i>vs.<\/i> Bussard (11 Wheat., 309), said (p. 362):<br\/><blockquote>\"We adhere to the doctrine thus\u00a0 stated, and think it the only exposition of the statute which is consistent with its true object and import.\u00a0 If the bar is sought to be removed by the proof of a new promise, that promise! as a new cause of action, ought to be proved in a clear and explicit manner, and be in its terms\u00a0 unequivocal and\u00a0 determinate; and\u00a0 if any conditions are annexed, they ought to be shown to be performed. \u00a0<br\/><br\/>\"If there be no express promise, but a promise is to be raised by implication of law from\u00a0 the acknowledgment of the\u00a0 party, such aknowledgment ought to contain an unqualified\u00a0 and direct\u00a0 admission of\u00a0 a\u00a0 previous, subsisting debt, which the party is liable and willing to pay.\u00a0\u00a0 If there be the accompanying circumstances, which\u00a0 repel\u00a0 the presumption of a promise or intention to pay; if the expressions be equivocal,\u00a0 vague and indeterminate, leading to no certain conclusion, but at best to probable inferences, which may affect different minds in\u00a0 different ways,\u00a0 we\u00a0 think\u00a0 they ought not to\u00a0 go to a jury as evidence of a new promise to revive the cause of action.\u00a0 (Shepherd <i>vs.<\/i> Thompson, 122 U.

Rep. 484), and wherein decision\u00a0 was handed down on\u00a0 October 3, 1906, affirming the judgment of the lower court against\u00a0 Ceferino\u00a0 Tan-Suyco, as well\u00a0 as that part of the judgment\u00a0 in favor of Simeon Tan-Suyco.<br\/><br\/>\"It appears that when this decision of the Supreme Court had been\u00a0 transmitted to\u00a0 this Court of First Instance, the sheriff was then directed to return the attached animals to Simeon Tan-Suyco, and that they were returned on December 1, 1906,\u00a0 with the exception of\u00a0 8 which had died in the depositary's hands.\u00a0 It appears beyond doubt that these 8 animals died through\u00a0 no fault of the person in whose custody they were,\u00a0 some of them\u00a0 from old age and some from the epizooty prevailing in this province.<br\/><br\/>\"The present\u00a0 action was instituted by the plaintiff on account of the damage thus sustained, but the\u00a0 defendants allege\u00a0 that it is <i>res judicata<\/i>, having been\u00a0 settled\u00a0 by the decision in case No. 270.<br\/><br\/>\"At the hearing of this case\u00a0 in this court the plaintiff was rather vague in his testimony with reference to the damage he sustained.\u00a0 When asked how long he had\u00a0 been deprived of th,e use of his animals, he did not specify the dates, saying about three years.\u00a0 He\u00a0 submitted no evidence to show the value of the\u00a0 8 animals that died; but it would appear that he suffered loss at the rate of P0.50 for\u00a0 each day, including Sundays, that these animals\u00a0 were withheld from him, and for each and all of them, male and female, old\u00a0 and young, and\u00a0 even for those\u00a0 that died;\u00a0 that is, in his\u00a0 last amendment to his complaint\u00a0 he asked for damages in the sum of P12,250.<br\/><br\/>\"However,\u00a0 in view of\u00a0 the court's\u00a0 intention in this\u00a0 suit, it is thought\u00a0 unnecessary to weigh the evidence regarding the\u00a0 amount\u00a0 of\u00a0 damages the plaintiff might\u00a0 have\u00a0 been allowed to collect herein.<br\/><br\/>\"This court holds\u00a0 that the matter is res judicata, this same\u00a0 action for\u00a0 damages having been settled in case\u00a0 No. 270.\u00a0 It was\u00a0 one of the matters\u00a0 in litigation, brought\u00a0 thus into question by Simeon\u00a0 Tan-Suyco; and some\u00a0 statements were\u00a0 made by\u00a0 him based upon the\u00a0 previous action.\u00a0\u00a0 In preparing and rendering the judgment in case No. 270, the trial judge considered the question\u00a0 of the\u00a0 damages\u00a0 that might\u00a0 have been granted to Simeon\u00a0 Tan-Suyco.<br\/><br\/>\"In the opinion of this court,\u00a0 this is a case that plainly comes\u00a0 under\u00a0 the principles constituting <i>res judicata<\/i> in the Philippine Islands, laid down in the decision of the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands in the case of\u00a0 Tanguinlay <i>vs.<\/i> Quiros (10 Phil. Rep., 360), where the matter is fully and clearly discussed.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It will be remembered that in the other case (No. 270) the present plaintiff asked for damages resulting from the alleged\u00a0 unlawful attachment.\u00a0 The\u00a0 court did\u00a0 not allow damages in that case.\u00a0\u00a0 The plaintiff did\u00a0 not appeal from that decision, thereby indicating that he was satisfied with the same.\u00a0 As\u00a0 was said above, the plaintiff,\u00a0 nearly two years after the termination of that action (No. 270), commenced the present action for the purpose of litigating again the very question which he had presented in\u00a0 the first case, thus incurring additional costs and expenses, which should always be avoided when possible.\u00a0 And, moreover,\u00a0 section 439\u00a0 of the Code\u00a0 of Procedure in\u00a0 Civil Actions expressly makes provision for the recovery of damages in connection with\u00a0 an action\u00a0 for the\u00a0 recovery\u00a0 of\u00a0 property illegally .attached.\u00a0 The question then as to damages for the\u00a0 alleged illegal attachment, which was involved in action No. 270, must have been litigated in that action and\u00a0 is, therefore, <i>res fudicata<\/i> of the question presented here.<br\/><blockquote>\"The law of <i>res judicata<\/i> is well settled in the United States and is laid down in a\u00a0 series\u00a0 of decisions of the Supreme Court\u00a0 to the effect that as between the parties\u00a0 to the first judgment and their privies, it operates as a bar\u00a0 to a second action upon the same claim, <i>not only as to the issues actually in litigation but also as to all matters which might have been litigated therein,<\/i> whereas in an action between them upon a different cause it is a bar only as to matters actually litigated.\u00a0 (Cromwell\u00a0 <i>vs<\/i>. County of Sac, 94 U. S., 351; Werlein <i>vs.<\/i> New Orleans, 177 U. S., 390; U. S, <i>vs. <\/i>California Co.,\u00a0 192 U. &amp;, 355; Fayerweather vs. Ritch, 195 U. S., 276, 299; Northern Pacific Railway Co. <i>vs.<\/i> Slaght, 205 U. S., 122.)\u00b0\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It might be argued, however, that under the provisions of section 307 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions, that because the lower court in said action No. 270, made no finding whatever with reference to damages that it should he assumed that the question of damages was not litigated in said action (270).<br\/><br\/>Section 307 provides: \"That only is deemed to have been adjudged in a former\u00a0 judgment\u00a0 which appears\u00a0 upon\u00a0 its face to have been so adjudged, or which was actually and necessarily included\u00a0 therein or necessary thereto.\"\u00a0 Said section 307 is an exact reproduction of section 1911 of the Code of Civil Procedure of the State of California, and has been construed many times\u00a0 by the supreme court of said State.\u00a0 (Taylor <i>vs.<\/i> Castle, 42 Cal., 367; Phalen <i>vs<\/i>.

Cross, 116 Cal., 473; Bingham <i>vs.<\/i> Kearney,\u00a0 136 Cal., 175; Estate of Harrington, 174 Cal., 124, 128.)<br\/><br\/>In the case of Bingham\u00a0 <i>vs.<\/i> Kearney above cited,\u00a0 the supreme court of the State of California said:<br\/><blockquote>\"It is the rule, long\u00a0 recognized in this country, that a judgment between the same\u00a0 parties is conclusive, <i>not only as to the subject matter in controversy in the action upon which it is based,<\/i> but also in all other actions involving the same question, and upon all\u00a0 matters involved in the issues <i> which might have been litigated and decided in the case,.<\/i> the presumption being that all such issues were made and decided.\u00a0 It is the policy of the law to put an end to litigation, and to aid the vigilant\u00a0 and not those who sleep upon their rights.\u00a0 <i>It is not the policy of the law to allow a new and different suit between the same parties, concerning the same subject matter, that has already been Htigated; neither will\u00a0 the law allow the parties to trifle with the courts by piecemeal litigation.<\/i><br\/><br\/>\"If the parties to an action fail to assert their claim properly\u00a0 or to present proper evidence in the first suit, they will not again be permitted in a second action to litigate the same questions.\u00a0 These principles are elementary.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The principles applicable to <i>res judicata <\/i>under American jurisprudence\u00a0 are supported\u00a0 by many\u00a0 decisions of\u00a0 the supreme court of Spain.<br\/><br\/>There is nothing in the record which shows\u00a0 why\u00a0 the plaintiff herein did not insist upon having a finding of the lower court in action No. 270, upon the question of damages. Under his\u00a0 pleadings he had a perfect\u00a0 right to present evidence upon the question of the amount\u00a0 of damages\u00a0 which he actually suffered.\u00a0 He\u00a0 also had a right to insist upon a decision upon whatever evidence he introduced upon\u00a0 that question.\u00a0 If the court refused to make a finding upon such evidence or denied his\u00a0 right to recover\u00a0 damages\u00a0 at all, it was his duty to have appealed in that action (270), for the purpose of having the question of damages settled in\u00a0 that action, instead of waiting\u00a0 and commencing a separate and distinct action for the same purpose.<br\/><br\/>This court, speaking\u00a0 through Mr. Justice Carson, in the case of Lanuza <i>vs.<\/i> Gonzalez (17 Phil. Rep., 413) said:<br\/><blockquote>\"Relief can not be granted in a second action, either by the trial court or by the Supreme Court, when the relief sought might have been secured by an\u00a0 appeal in the former action; hence, when a court, after due trial, renders a judgment adjudicating the ownership of property and no appeal is taken, under the provisions of section 306 of the Code of Civil Procedure the judgment becomes final and\u00a0 the matter must be regarded as <i>res adjudicata,<\/i> notwithstanding the fact that, if an appeal had\u00a0 been taken, the judgment of the lower court might have been reversed in the second instance.

The prosecution claims that\u00a0 the deceased was assaulted\u00a0 by 4he accused who approached him from behind, cautiously, without any provocation whatever (for the evidence of the prosecution did not disclose the existence of any) and, in the presence of the woman Filomena Molina and\u00a0 of Santiago Elseco, assaulted the deceased, with a bolo, inflicting\u00a0 upon him\u00a0 wounds from which\u00a0 he died.\u00a0\u00a0 The defense adduced clearer,\u00a0 more\u00a0 reasonable and comprehensible\u00a0 facts.\u00a0 The young people, Agapita Gaspar and Sabino Molina, lived together\u00a0 as\u00a0 husband and wife, with\u00a0 the consent of\u00a0 both families, in accordance\u00a0 with a\u00a0 custom which,\u00a0 it appears, prevails among a certain class of people in the Province of Cagayan.\u00a0\u00a0 Apparently it was\u00a0 agreed that\u00a0 these\u00a0 young people should marry later, but in the meantime the deceased had trouble with Sabino Molina and expelled him from the house.\u00a0 It is very natural to suppose that the deceased may have\u00a0 pondered\u00a0 over\u00a0 the affair after the\u00a0 quarrel.\u00a0 His daughter hadjost her reputation and honor,\u00a0 and whatever be the motive which impelled him to\u00a0 send for the accused, whether to avenge himself for the dishonor of his daughter or to settle the\u00a0 trouble that\u00a0 had arisen, the court, taking into account all these circumstances, must accept as a fact proved beyond all reasonable\u00a0 doubt, the conclusion that the deceased, on\u00a0 the day of the crime, sent\u00a0 for the accused. Moreover, if the accused\u00a0 had had the intention of going to the house of the deceased for\u00a0 the purpose of killing him, it is very improbable that he should have taken his sister, Filomena Molina, with him.\u00a0 The presence of this woman, in the opinion of this court,\u00a0 is\u00a0 highly corroborative of the claim made by the defense,\u00a0 that the accused went to the house of the deceased on the\u00a0 day of the crime with the intention of attending a council between the two families, and. not with the intention of causing any harm to the deceased. It was not shown what occurred between these two men or what words were exchanged that may have given rise to the fight, but the court must believe, in view of all the testimony adduced, that the accused and his companions were unarmed; that the deceased was armed with a bolo; that the latter was the aggressor, and that the accused, after having overpowered the deceased, wrested from him the bolo which he was carrying and with it struck the deceased\u00a0 several blows, thereby killing him\u00a0 almost instantly.\"<\/blockquote>To the statements of the court, the Attorney-General in his brief adds that the accused presented himself to the authorities immediately after the occurrence, which, he says, is circumstantial evidence that\u00a0 corroborates the conclusion of the lower\u00a0 court that\u00a0 the\u00a0 said accused\u00a0 was unlawfully assaulted by the deceased.<br\/><br\/>We accept the finding of the trial court in regard to this point.\u00a0\u00a0 We believe that the assault was really commenced by the deceased and that it was not provoked in any manner by the accused, and also that the latter was completely unarmed at the time he was assaulted.\u00a0 Withal, the\u00a0 lower court was of the opinion that there was no rational necessity for the means employed by the said accused for the\u00a0 purpose of repelling the attack\u00a0 made upon him.\u00a0 He says:<br\/><blockquote>\"The accused himself admitted that he only received a slight scratch above the eye during the struggle in which he engaged with the deceased, and admitted, moreover, that the deceased was unarmed and completely at his mercy after the accused had disarmed him.\u00a0 The evidence showed that the accused could have wrested the bolo from the deceased and afterwards fled, had he wished to respect the life of the deceased, and the court is of the opinion that there was no rational necessity for\u00a0 the accused to have slain his adversary, once that he had become master of the bolo.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The last part of this, reasoning is sufficiently answered in the Attorney-General's brief, wherein it is said, and rightly, citing the decision of the\u00a0 supreme court of Spain of\u00a0 April 21, 1880, that the fact of the assaulted party's not taking to flight is not a sufficient reason for not upholding, in a proper case, the rational necessity for the means employed to repel the assault.<br\/><br\/>Moreover, it is not exactly true that the deceased remained completely at the mercy of the accused after the latter had wrested the bolo from\u00a0 him,\u00a0 and much Jess did\u00a0 the\u00a0 accused admit such a thing.in\u00a0 his testimony; far from making an admission of this kind, he expressly and insistently stated that the deceased, on losing possession of the bolo, seized, or tried to seize,\u00a0 a hatchet, in order therewith to continue the assault, and that it was when\u00a0 the accused\u00a0 perceived such attempt that he\u00a0 slashed the\u00a0 deceased on the head with the same bolo.he had wrested\u00a0 from him.\u00a0 It was clearly shown by the testimony of\u00a0 the accused, corroborated by the\u00a0 witness Elseco, that after the commencement of the assault by the deceased, the struggle between the latter and the accused did not cease for one moment, now each combatant trying to wrest the bolo away from the other, now the deceased endeavoring to arm himself with the hatchet which undoubtedly was within his reach, until finally the deceased himself was disabled and could no\u00a0 longer continue to struggle in consequence of the wounds which he received during the affray.\u00a0 Considering the decidedly aggressive attitude of the deceased from the commencement of this struggle until its termination, it\u00a0 can\u00a0 not be said that there was a cessation of the danger for the accused, even for a single\u00a0 instant If,\u00a0 through the various incidents of the struggle, or any favorable accident whatever, the deceased had succeeded in recovering the bolo or in possessing himself of the hatchet, as he attempted to\u00a0 do to the last, the result of the combat would probably have been\u00a0 very different; perhaps the accused, instead of being the slayer, would himself have been killed.\u00a0 The accused\u00a0 certainly was not\u00a0 in\u00a0 duty bound\u00a0 to expose himself to such a contingency, and while the struggle continued,\u00a0 and,\u00a0 consequently,\u00a0 the danger to his person\u00a0 or to his life subsisted he had a perfect and indisputable right to repel such danger by wounding his adversary, if necessary, as from the circumstances of the\u00a0 case it\u00a0 was,\u00a0 without any doubt whatever, and even to\u00a0 disable him completely so that he could not\u00a0 continue the\u00a0 assault.\u00a0 In\u00a0 our opinion, the means employed by the accused were rationally necessary to repel the assault, and as the\u00a0 latter was in all respects unlawful and was not preceded by any provocation of any kind on the part of\u00a0 the accused himself, we declare the said accused to be exempt from criminal liability, in accordance with the provisions\u00a0 of paragraph\u00a0 4 of article 8 of the Penal Code.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is reversed, the defendant is acquitted and will immediately be released, with the costs of both instances <i>de oficio.<\/i>\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

It is argued, however, on his behalf, that the land is public land owned by the Government, and that he acquired rights therein by his\u00a0 proceeding under the Act of July 1, 1902, and\u00a0 that the possession of the defendants\u00a0 is subordinated to such rights.\u00a0 Even if we concede that the land in question is public land,\u00a0 nevertheless the defendants' possession for more than thirty years has given them frights which\u00a0 even the Government itself is bound in a measure to respect.\u00a0 In order to claim\u00a0 rights under the Act of July 1, 1902, the plaintiff must show that he has properly staked the land; but in making that showing he necessarily discloses also that\u00a0 in staking that land\u00a0 he violated certain rights of the defendants.\u00a0 The latter, having acquired actual possession of the land and .having maintained that possession for\u00a0 a long\u00a0 series of years, can not be forcibly dispossessed thereof, or from any portion thereof, even by the Government itself.<br\/><br\/>Article 441 of the\u00a0 Civil Code provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"In no case can possession be forcibly acquired while there is a possessor opposing it.\u00a0 A person believing that\u00a0 he has an action\u00a0 or right to deprive another of the holding\u00a0 of a thing must request the assistance of competent\u00a0 authority whenever the holder refuses the delivery.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Article 446 of the same code\u00a0 provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"Every possessor has a right to he respected in his\u00a0 possession; and\u00a0 should he be disturbed\u00a0 therein,\u00a0 he must be protected or possession must be restored to\u00a0 him by the means established in the laws of procedure.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Article 448 provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"The possessor by virtue of ownership\u00a0 has in his favor the legal presumption that he ftolds possession by reason of a sufficient title\u00a0 and he can not be forced to show it.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Article 459 provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"The actual possessor\u00a0 who shows\u00a0 his\u00a0 possession at\u00a0 a prior period is presumed to have had possession also during the intermediate period until the contrary is proved.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Article 460 provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"The\u00a0 possessor may lose his posseesion:<br\/><br\/>\"1. By the abandonment of the thing:.<br\/><br\/>\"2. By transfer to another for a good or valuable consideration.<br\/><br\/>\"3. By the destruction or total loss of t he thing or by the thing becoming: unmarketable.<br\/><br\/>\"4. By the possession of another, even against the will of the former possessor, if the new possession has lasted more than one year.\"<\/blockquote>It is, therefore, evident that even, if we\u00a0 concede the land in controversy to be Government l&amp;nd; the defendant^ having acquired the rights of a possessor, can not be deprived; of those rights except by due process of law, even though the Government itself be the complaining party.<br\/><br\/>All of the rights which the plaintiff alleges in this action are rights which are based upon a trespass against the personal rights of the deferadants.\u00a0\u00a0 Upon the provisions of the code above referred to, and upon the general principle that a party may not take advantage of his\u00a0 own wrong,\u00a0 we are of the opinion that the plaintiff can not maintain this, action. Every right which the plaintiff asserts\u00a0 in this case springs from the performance of an act which the law prohibited; at the time of its, performance.<br\/><br\/>It is to be observed that the rights of the Government in the lands in question are not in this case adjudicated.\u00a0 The Government is not a party and whatever is said and decided in this case applies only to the parties\u00a0 to this\u00a0 action.<br\/><br\/>Moreover,\u00a0 this decision refers to and\u00a0 affects\u00a0 only that land of defendants described in the conveyance in evidence.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the\u00a0 trial court is affirmed, with costs of this instance.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/>A<i>rellano, C.

On the morning of June 9, 1910, while the woman Dahu\u00a0 was in the field engaged in planting sweet potatoes, she was approached by Jakan Tucko who asked\u00a0 her what she was doing,\u00a0 to which Dahu replied\u00a0 that she was\u00a0 planting\u00a0 camotes, or sweet potatoes, in order to have something to eat;\u00a0 thereupon Tucko said to her: \"Although you are planting camotes, you will not eat them, because pretty soon\u00a0 there will be a heavy shower.\"<\/p><p>At a very late hour of the night of the same day, the 9th, while the spouses Maalum and\u00a0 DaM, and the latter's brother, named Saali, were asleep in their house,\u00a0 the husband suddenly awakened his wife, telling her that he had been wounded.\u00a0 When Dahu and Saali awoke they saw that Maalum was seriously wounded in the stomach, and when he was asked how he had\u00a0 been hurt he replied that he had been assaulted by\u00a0 the Moro Tucko, who must have gained entrance to the house by passing through the door, which had\u00a0 been closed\u00a0 before they\u00a0 went\u00a0 to\u00a0 sleep that\u00a0 night. Maalum\u00a0 died a few moments after he had\u00a0 been wounded. These facts took place one month after the marriage of the said spouses,\u00a0 and were disclosed by the testimony presented and by the confession of the perpetrator of the crime.<\/p><p>For the foregoing reasons, on August 6, 1910,\u00a0 the assistant prosecuting attorney of the\u00a0 Moro Province filed an information in the\u00a0 Court of First Instance\u00a0 of Zamboanga, charging Jakan Tucko with the crime of murder, and, this cause having been\u00a0 instituted, the\u00a0 court in view\u00a0 of the evidence adduced,\u00a0 rendered judgment,\u00a0 on\u00a0 November\u00a0 1, 1910, sentencing the defendant to be\u00a0 hanged, to the accessory penalties, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum\u00a0 of Pl,000, and to pay the costs of the trial.\u00a0 It was ordered\u00a0 in the judgment that\u00a0 the said death penalty should be executed\u00a0 at the very place\u00a0 where the crime was committed and on a date to be fixed after the\u00a0 judgment should have been reviewed by the Supreme Court when all the other penalties\u00a0 imposed should be carried out.<\/p><p>It is held that the foregoing facts,\u00a0 which were perfectly proven\u00a0 at the trial of this\u00a0 cause, constitute in fact the serious crime of murder,\u00a0 provided for and punished by article 403 of the Penal Code, inasmuch as the deceased Moro, Maalum, was, on the night of June 9, 1910, violently killed in his\u00a0 house while he was asleep,\u00a0 and the aggressor employed ways and means in the commission of the crime tending\u00a0 directly and specially to insure\u00a0 its consummation, without\u00a0 his\u00a0 having run any risk\u00a0 from such defense the victim might offer in protecting himself, the crime therefore being committed\u00a0 perfidiously, with absolute security on the part of the perpetrator, and with manifest treachery.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding that the defendant Jakan Tucko pleaded not guilty, yet\u00a0 he stated\u00a0 under oath in the\u00a0 preliminary examination\u00a0 before the judge of\u00a0 the tribal ward court, F, T. Winters, that, on the night of the crime he\u00a0 entered Maalum's house and with a bolo called a lahut assaulted the latter while he was asleep, inflicting a serious wound in the stomach; that in so doing he was actuated by revenge, for the reason that the deceased Haalum abducted and married Dahu, his betrothed,\u00a0 and because a feud existed between his family and that of Maalum, on account of a brother of the deceased Mudhajilon, having a year\u00a0 before killed\u00a0 a cousin of the defendant's, named\u00a0 Botong-botong.<\/p><p>Aside from this confession, made frankly and of his own will and accord by the accused before a competent authority during\u00a0 the preliminary investigation, the trial record also offers other irrefutable proof, which\u00a0 ii the statement made by the deceased in <em>articulo mortis<\/em>, before'the latter's wife and his brother-in-law,\u00a0 Saali,\u00a0 a few\u00a0 moments before\u00a0 he expired, while he was in a precarious condition, for, according to the testimony of these relatives, Maalum, a few moments\u00a0 before\u00a0 he died, said that his wound\u00a0 had been inflicted by the defendant Jakan Tucko.<\/p><p>The statement, made by the deceased when he was in a serious\u00a0 condition\u00a0 and death seemed imminent, is legitimate and admissible as a ground for a judgment\u00a0 of conviction, and with all the more reason when, as in the present case, such last statement in <em>articulo mortis<\/em> is shown to have been corroborated by\u00a0 the\u00a0 confession\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 assailant and by other circumstantial evidence which, united and combined, produce in the mind the perfect and full conviction of the accused's\u00a0 guilt as\u00a0 the sole\u00a0 proved\u00a0 perpetrator\u00a0 by direct participation of the crime of murder under prosecution.<\/p><p>In United States <em>vs<\/em>. Castellon et al. (12 Phil. Rep., 160), the following principle was laid down:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"1.<em> Evidence;\u00a0 hearsay;\u00a0 dying declarations<\/em>. - Notwithstanding the fact that hearsay evidence is not admissible at a trial, the\u00a0 statements made\u00a0 by\u00a0 an individual\u00a0 who is seriously wounded, at a moment when he was dying, being convinced that\u00a0 there\u00a0 was no hope of\u00a0 recovery, constitute per 8e at least\u00a0 a\u00a0 grave,\u00a0 conclusive and decisive indication of the culpability of the persons designated\u00a0 by the dying man, inasmuch as it must be assumed\u00a0 that he, being in so precarious a condition,\u00a0 spoke truthfully, and that he was not induced by a desire to tell a He and to injure an innocent person.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The defendant,\u00a0 overwhelmed with spite and resentment, on account of Dahu marrying the deceased instead of him, she preferring the former and rejecting the latter's proposal to marry her, and for the purpose of carrying into effect the revenge that he had premeditated, removed his residence from the <em>sitio<\/em> of Cobengbeng, a distant point, to that of Guiu, not far from the house of the deceased; and on the morning of the day of the crime, while Dahu was engaged in planting <em>camotes<\/em> in a field nearby, she was accosted by the defendant, Tucko, who said to her: \"Although you are planting camotes, you will\u00a0 not eat\u00a0 them,\"\u00a0 and when she asked him why, he replied saying: \"Because pretty soon there\u00a0 will be a heavy shower,\"\u00a0 by\u00a0 which Dahu,\u00a0 and her father-in-law when he had been\u00a0 informed of the incident, understood that a homicide or murder was. meant.\u00a0 These facts constitute circumstantial evidence, logically\u00a0 derived from the conduct, acts and words of the\u00a0 defendant and corroborate\u00a0 the other evidence\u00a0 herein\u00a0 above mentioned, all of which, united and combined, demonstrate the defendant's guilt as the unquestionable aggressor of the deceased Maalum.<\/p><p>In the commission\u00a0 of the murder the presence of the circumstance of known premeditation, as well as that of its having been\u00a0 perpetrated in the dwelling of the deceased, must be considered\u00a0 as mere aggravating\u00a0 circumstances, and it is improper to give weight to the circumstance of nocturnity, on account of its\u00a0 being included in\u00a0 that\u00a0 of treachery which classifies the crime.\u00a0 No circumstance of wrongful entry was attendant, for it was not proved that the\u00a0 aggressor entered the house through any other way than that intended as an entry, and he must have entered and gone out through the door of the house, which was afterwards found\u00a0 open.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 said two aggravating circumstances are counterbalanced in\u00a0 their effects\u00a0 by the special circumstance established in article 11 of the penal Code, in consideration of the race to which the defendant belongs, his barbarous and savage customs, and his absolute lack of education and culture.\u00a0\u00a0 This special circumstance is with greater reason\u00a0 applicable to the Moros, as shown by the\u00a0 explanations of\u00a0 the code\u00a0 committee,\u00a0 which precede the Penal Code, among which are the following statements:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"It is absolutely impossible, in\u00a0 accord with the principles of justice and\u00a0 in harmony with\u00a0 the necessary social guarantees,\u00a0 to establish penalties applicable to\u00a0 each separate particular case, considering the various grades of civilization and\u00a0 culture of the different races, their moral and religious\u00a0 education, and their\u00a0 capacity\u00a0 to support\u00a0 all the weight\u00a0 of a perfectly well-defined criminal\u00a0 responsibility. *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 This committee\u00a0 has not hesitated a single moment, in the framing of this proposed legislation, in basing its provisions on the principle of equality before the law, however,\u00a0 it has recognized the advisability that the courts of the Philippines wisely continue the practice uninterruptedly observed\u00a0 by them of\u00a0 applying lesser\u00a0 penalties\u00a0 than those prescribed\u00a0 for the crimes\u00a0 specified in the code,\u00a0 by taking into account, when reason and justice demand, the conditions of the native race or those of its members in\u00a0 all cases where a strict enforcement\u00a0 of a penal provision might result in\u00a0 an aggravation\u00a0 far\u00a0 from the intention\u00a0 of the legislator.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>With respect to\u00a0 the\u00a0 admissibility of\u00a0 the\u00a0 record\u00a0 of the proceedings had by the judge of the tribal ward court, in the form of a preliminary investigation of the crime charged in this case, Exhibit A, it must be taken into account that this document was through mistake sent to the office of the prosecuting attorney pf the province, instead of being transmitted to the clerk of the Court of First Instance, for which reason the trial judge, thinking that the records of the office of the fiscal of the Moro Province,\u00a0 in all matters relative to criminal cases, formed a\u00a0 part of those of the Court of First Instance,\u00a0 admitted the said\u00a0 document, which contains the defendant's confession and other statements taken\u00a0 in the aforementioned preliminary investigation, the record of which proceedings was afterwards exhibited at the trial as an integral part of the record of the case, and\u00a0 overruled the objection made\u00a0 by the\u00a0 defense to the\u00a0 admission\u00a0 in evidence of the said Exhibit A.<\/p><p>For the foregoing reasons, and the first two errors\u00a0 attributed to the judgment of the lower court by the defendant's\u00a0 counsel\u00a0 being refuted,\u00a0 it is proper, in our opinion, to\u00a0 reverse\u00a0 the judgment reviewed, and\u00a0 to\u00a0 sentence the defendant,\u00a0 Jakan\u00a0 Tucko, as we do hereby, to the penalty of life imprisonment, to the accessories 2 and 3\u00a0 of article 54 of the Penal Code, and, though he should obtain a remission of the principal penalty,\u00a0 to those of absolute\u00a0 perpetual disqualification and surveillance by the

Julio Llorente presiding, dismissing the complaint upon the merits after trial.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiffs in this case owned lands in the Province of Pampanga and constructed upon the same certain mills with appropriate machinery, operated by steam, for the purpose of manufacturing sugar from the cane.\u00a0 These mills were regarded by the provincial treasurer as\u00a0 improvements upon the real estate to\u00a0 which they were attached and he assessed them upon the tax rolls of the province accordingly.\u00a0 The plaintiffs, pursuant to\u00a0 such assessment and in accordance therewith, paid the taxes upon said real estate and mills for several years without protest.\u00a0 This action is brought for the purpose of having the court (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">a<\/span>) adjudge that the mills in question did not and do not constitute improvements upon the real estate; (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">b<\/span>) prohibit the defendant from assessing and collecting further taxes upon said mills; (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">c<\/span>) and require the defendant to return to the plaintiffs the taxes already paid upon said mills.<br\/><br\/>As to the first proposition, there can be no question.\u00a0 The mills erected upon the property for the purpose mentioned are clearly improvements\u00a0 upon\u00a0 the property.<br\/><br\/>These mills being improvements, it was and is the duty of the provincial treasurer to assess then under\u00a0 section 54 of the Municipal Code, which provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"(<i>a)<\/i> After having completed the list,\u00a0 the board shall proceed to assess the value of each separate parcel of real estate, and the improvements thereon, if any, at their true value in money; and, where it shall appear that there are separate owners of the land and of the improvements, a separate assessment of the property of each shall be made. <br\/><br\/>\"(<i>b<\/i>) The values so fixed shall be placed upon the tax list opposite the names of the owners\u00a0 and the descriptions of the property taxed.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>This disposes also of the second proposition presented by the plaintiffs.<br\/><br\/>Apropos of the third proposition, as well as the other two, we\u00a0 present the following sections of the Municipal Code:<br\/><blockquote>\"SEC,\u00a0 56.\u00a0 The board\u00a0 of assessors shall\u00a0 complete their listing and valuation of real property situated within the municipality on or before January thirty-first, nineteen hundred and two, and, when completed, shall authenticate the same by signing the following certificate at the foot of the list:<br\/><br\/>\"'We hereby\u00a0 certify that the foregoing list contains a true statement of the agregate amount of the taxable\u00a0 real estate belonging to each person named in the list, according to the best of our knowledge and belief.'<br\/><br\/>\"SEC.\u00a0 57. When the list shall be completed in accordance with the foregoing section, it shall be filed in the office of the secretary of the board and the board of assessors shall, by notice posted at the main entrance of the municipal building and by a notice posted in a public and conspicuous place in each barrio of the municipality, inform the public that the list has\u00a0 been completed and is on file in the office of the secretary of the board and may be examined by any person interested therein, and that, upon a day, at least ten days after the posting of said notice, the board will be in session for the purpose of hearing complaints as to the accuracy of the listing of the property and a proper valuation thereof. After such notices\u00a0 have been posted\u00a0 the secretary shall certify to the fact of posting upon the\u00a0 records, which shall be deemed <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">prima facie<\/span> evidence thereof.\u00a0\u00a0 At the day fixed in the posted notice, the board shall meet and hear all complaints then\u00a0 or theretofore filed\u00a0 by persons against whom taxes have been assessed as owners of real estate, and shall make and enter the decision on its minutes; and\u00a0 if the board shall determine that injustice has,been done or errors have\u00a0 been committed, it shall have authority to amend the list in accordance with its findings.<br\/><br\/>\"SEC.\u00a0 58. In case any\u00a0 complainant before the\u00a0 board of assessors shall feel aggrieved by its decision, he may, within ten days after the entry of the decision upon the minutes, appeal to a board of tax\u00a0 appeals hereinafter provided for. He shall perfect his appeal by filing a written notice of the same with the board of assessors, and\u00a0 it shall be the duty of the secretary of said\u00a0 board forthwith to transmit the appeal to the board of tax appeals, with all written evidence in the possession of the board relating to said assessment and valuation.\"<br\/><br\/>\"SEC.\u00a0 84.

The last speech having come to an end, the people inside the house crowded down the stairs and\u00a0 out on to the street; some of the more timorous ones climbed out of the windows at the back of the house, but later events\u00a0 demonstrate that there was no necessity for such a superabundance of precaution, as,\u00a0 with\u00a0 possibly a single exception, thdse who went on to the street either\u00a0 went\u00a0 peaceably to their homes or mingled with the party outside, without any\u00a0 attempt\u00a0 on the part of the latter to do them any injury or in any way molest them.\u00a0 The single exception to\u00a0 the peaceable dispersal of the crowd on that occasion was an altercation which arose between\u00a0 two individuals, members respectively of the\u00a0 different parties,\u00a0 both of whom were arrested by the police and taken to jail.\u00a0 Their arrest seems to\u00a0 have been occasioned by their individual misconduct and not to have been in any way the result of a conflict between the parties as a whole; and it does not clearly appear from the evidence which of the two was the original aggressor.\u00a0 There is some testimony to the effect that some of the members of the party outside threw stones at the house where the meeting was in progress, but none of the stones appear to have entered the windows and there was certainly no general stone throwing indulged in by the crowd\u00a0 who\u00a0 were standing immediately under the windows where the meeting was being held.\u00a0 That there was some slight disturbance connected with the closing of the meeting can not be\u00a0 doubted, but on a review of the whole record we do not think that it could have been\u00a0 of a very serious\u00a0 nature.\u00a0 Partisan feeling was running very high at the time, and to us it seems rather remarkable that under all the circumstances a serious disturbance did not take place.\u00a0 We are inclined to think that the party outside the house did\u00a0 not plan a serious\u00a0 disturbance or\u00a0 intend that one should take place, as otherwise it could hardly have been avoided.\u00a0 Their stopping in front of the house would appear to have\u00a0 had for its object an effort to induce some\u00a0 of the persons who were attending the first meeting to accompany them to other meetings being held at other places in the same\u00a0 town,\u00a0 where the claims of other candidates for office were\u00a0 being pressed upon the attention of voters; and also perhaps, to impress upon the minds of those attending the meeting\u00a0 inside,\u00a0 the fact that the candidate who organized it was not the\u00a0 only one who could\u00a0 boast of a substantial following at the elections to take place the following day.<br\/><br\/>The trial judge was of opinion that each and all of the members of the party\u00a0 who stopped outside\u00a0 of the house where the meeting was being held were guilty of the crime of \"gravely\" disturbing the\u00a0 public order on the occasion of a largely attended reunion or meeting, as defined and penalized in article 258 of the Penal\u00a0 Code, and found the appellants guilty of that crime.\u00a0 Five of them, who, as it appears, were officials of the municipality, were sentenced to six months of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">arresto mayor<\/span> and the payment of a fine of 2,625 pesetas each, and seventeen others\u00a0 were sentenced to four months and one day of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">arresto mayor<\/span> and the payment of a fine of 1,500 pesetas each.\u00a0 We are of opinion, however, that while the evidence\u00a0 sustains the finding of the trial court that all these defendants were members\u00a0 of the\u00a0 gathering which stopped outside on the street\u00a0 while the meeting was in progress inside, the offense committed by these appellants constituted merely\u00a0 a\u00a0 misdemeanor as defined in section 4 of article 574 of the Penal Code, which is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"ART. 674. A fine of from 15 to 125 pesetas and reprimand may be imposed upon:<br\/><center><br\/>* \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*<br\/><\/center> <br\/>\"4. Those who, without being included in other provisions of this code, shall lightly disturb public order by using means that naturally would produce alarm or disturbance.\"<\/blockquote>The trial judge based his conclusion that the defendants were guilty of the crime of \"gravely\" or grossly disturbing the public\u00a0 order as defined and penalized in\u00a0 article 258 of the Penal Code, on three grounds:<br\/><br\/>(1) Because the meeting which was disturbed was organized in connection\u00a0 with the municipal elections to be held the next day:<br\/><br\/>(2) Because it appears that\u00a0 the\u00a0 ill-will engendered between the partisans of the various candidates at the election, resulted in such general disorder that some days thereafter a special detachment of Constabulary was required to keep the peace in the municipality; and<br\/><br\/>(3) Because some of the members of the party comprising the crowd in the street held municipal offices and were candidates for reelection\u00a0 thereto.<br\/><br\/>Under the provisions of Chapter VI [Title III, Book II] of the Penal Code we would be entirely agreed with the trial judge in his characterization of the disturbance of which the defendants were guilty, as a \"grave\" or a \"gross\" disturbance of public order, had it taken place in connection with the actual\u00a0 holding of an election; for instance, in\u00a0 or about a voting booth, or the place where the votes were being\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 counted,\u00a0 or, perhaps on the\u00a0 public highway along which voters on their way to exercise their\u00a0 right to vote must necessarily pass.\u00a0 But we think that under all the circumstances of this case, the fact that numerous meetings were being held at which the citizens and voters called together in public by contending candidates and their partisans for the purpose of inducing or persuading them to support one candidate or the other at the forthcoming election, tends to justify a lenient\u00a0 rather than a\u00a0 severe\u00a0 judgment of the nature, object, and conduct of the gathering of which the defendants formed a part.\u00a0\u00a0 In the excitement of a hotly contested campaign, some allowances must be made for the tense state of public feeling,\u00a0 and not every petty\u00a0 incident should be magnified into a matter of grave import.\u00a0 Within reasonable limits the candidates and their partisans should be willing, to bear and forbear with each other, recognizing that at such a time things\u00a0 are often said and done in the heat of the contest, which the authors themselves in a calmer moment would be the first to deprecate.\u00a0\u00a0 And so the courts, in passing upon the question whether a breach of the peace has resulted on such an occasion from the clash of contending wills and the\u00a0 conflict of opposing policies, opinions, and sentiments,\u00a0 and in characterizing such public disorders as do actually arise, should keep\u00a0 in mind the actual conditions. The assembling of the people together, marching and countermarching in bands from place\u00a0 to place, endeavoring by speeches and debate\/both public and private, to hold together the partisans of one set of policies or candidates and to draw away the partisans of opposing policies and candidates, while it undoubtedly tends to disturb the peace and quiet which ordinarily\u00a0 reigns in the community, does not necessarily involve a criminal breach of the peace or disturbance of public order.\u00a0 Where no municipal ordinance or public law\u00a0 or regulation forbidding such gatherings is violated, a criminal breach of the peace can not properly be said to have been committed,\u00a0 unless\u00a0 the\u00a0 disturbance created\u00a0 is such that it exceeds the limits within which the partisans may fairly be\u00a0 required to restrict themselves under the circumstances; and in imposing a penalty for a breach of the peace on such occasions, it must not be forgotten that the reprehensible conduct of the partisans does not consist of their assembling together and making public demonstrations, but in exceeding those limits of public order and good behavior beyond which, under the circumstances, the citizen may not pass.<br\/><br\/>Nor can we agree with the trial judge that the conduct of these\u00a0 accused amounted to\u00a0 a\u00a0 \"grave\" breach of the peace, because of the\u00a0 serious disorders which it appears broke\u00a0 out in the municipality after the election.\u00a0\u00a0 Had the proof shown that these disorders resulted directly or even indirectly from\u00a0 the\u00a0 disorderly\u00a0 conduct of the\u00a0 crowd of which these accused formed a part, that fact might perhaps be taken into consideration\u00a0 in\u00a0 characterizing the public disorder of which they were guilty;\u00a0 but\u00a0 there\u00a0 is not\u00a0 a particle of evidence which shows any relation of\u00a0 cause\u00a0 and effect, between the conduct of these accused on the night in question and the disturbances in the municipality which took place after the election had been held.<br\/><br\/>So too, when\u00a0 it is considered that\u00a0 the\u00a0 local\u00a0 municipal officials had a perfect right to take part in an election meeting and to join in a gathering of partisans of one candidate or the other,\u00a0 we do\u00a0 not think that their\u00a0 presence in\u00a0 the crowd substantially affected its nature, object, or purposes so as to convert\u00a0 the slight disorder of which its\u00a0 members were guilty into a grave breach of the peace.<br\/><br\/>The judgment\u00a0 of conviction and\u00a0 the\u00a0 penalty imposed by the trial court should, therefore, be reversed and we find all of the appellants and each of\u00a0 them guilty of the misdemeanor defined and\u00a0 penalized in article 574,\u00a0 section 4, of the Penal Code, and sentence them and each of them to pay a fine of P5 and the payment of\u00a0 their respective shares of the costs in the first instance, the costs of this instance to be <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">de oficio.<\/span>\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Nepomuceno, judge\u00a0 of the Eighth Judicial District, rendered a judgment declaring that the plaintiff was without\u00a0 right to the\u00a0 possession of the land in question and\u00a0 absolving the defendant from any liability under the said complaint, with costs against the plaintiff.<\/p><p>From that\u00a0 judgment of\u00a0 the lower court the plaintiff appealed and made the following assignment of error:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"The lower court erred in holding that the possession of the land in question was in Pedro Triunfo and not in Lope Torrecampo, on the date of the public sale by the sheriff.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>After a\u00a0 careful examination of the evidence adduced during the trial\u00a0 of the cause, we find that a\u00a0 preponderance of the evidence shows the following facts:<\/p><p>First. That on the\u00a0 29th\u00a0 of\u00a0 May,\u00a0 1903,\u00a0 one\u00a0 Estefanio Vargas Rojas, <em>mortgaged<\/em> the land in question\u00a0 (see Exhibit A) to the plaintiff herein for the sum of 200\u00a0 pesos Mexican currency.<\/p><p>Second. That some time after the said mortgage had been executed and delivered, Pedro Triunfo went into possession of the said land. The plaintiff claims that Pedro Triunfo was in possession of the land\u00a0 as his\u00a0 tenant.<\/p><p>Third. That on the 15th of August, 1907,\u00a0 the defendant herein (Balbino Vitero)\u00a0 commenced an action (No. 783) against the said Pedro Triunfo, for the purpose of recovering the sum of P2,711,\u00a0 with interest at the rate of 6 per cent from the 1st of February, 1904.\u00a0 At the close of the trial of that cause (No. 783), the Hon. Grant Trent, then judge of the Eighth Judicial District, rendered a judgment on the\u00a0 13th of November,\u00a0 1907, in\u00a0 favor of the plaintiff (Vitero)\u00a0 and against the\u00a0 defendant\u00a0 (Triunfo) for the sum of P2,711 Mexican currency with interest, etc., and costs.\u00a0 No appeal was taken from that judgment.<\/p><p>On the 14th of November, 1907, an execution was issued on said judgment and the parcel of land herein in question was attached and later, on or about the 1st of August, 1908, was sold\u00a0 at public auction\u00a0 to the defendant herein.\u00a0 The defendant herein has been in the possession\u00a0 of said parcel of land since that date.<\/p><p>Fourth. That in the month of April, 1908, the plaintiff herein (Torrecampo) commenced an\u00a0 action in the court of the justice of the\u00a0 peace of the pueblo of Bato, against the defendant herein (Vitero) to recover the possession of the land in question,\u00a0 which action was\u00a0 decided against the plaintiff and he did not appeal from\u00a0 said judgment of the justice of the peace.<\/p><p>The contention of the plaintiff herein is that, under his. said mortgage of\u00a0 the\u00a0 29th of May, 1903, he, through his tenant, Pedro Triunfo, was entitled to the possession of the land; that\u00a0 Pedro Triunfo\u00a0 was his\u00a0 tenant\u00a0 only.\u00a0\u00a0 Pedro Triunfo was not called as a witness during the trial of the cause.\u00a0\u00a0 The record\u00a0 discloses\u00a0 no reason why he was not. His testimony might have cleared up some of the difficulties which the case presents.<\/p><p>The only witness sworn in behalf of the plaintiff was the plaintiff himself.\u00a0\u00a0 He\u00a0 swore\u00a0 that Estefanio Vargas Rojas mortgaged the land in question to him on the 29th of May, 1903, and that Pedro Triunfo took possession of the land in question as his tenant.<\/p><p>Exiquio Vargas, son of the\u00a0 said Estefanio Vargas Rojas and Leon Mendoza appeared as witnesses for the defendant. The said Exiquio Vargas testified that his father mortgaged the\u00a0 land\u00a0 in\u00a0 question to Pedro Triunfo and\u00a0 Lope Torrecampo; that Pedro Triunfo was in possession of the said land at the time of the attachment in 1908;\u00a0 that he was the owner of the attached tract of land; that Pedro Triunfo had cultivated the land from 1903 to 1908 and had reaped the crops therefrom; that Pedro Triunfo had not delivered any portion of the said crops to the plaintiff Lope Torrecampo; that he had never seen the said Torrecampo on the said parcel of land.<\/p><p>Leon Mendoza testified that he knew the parties to the present action; that he owned the land adjoining the land in question and had owned said land since 1904; that Pedro Triunfo had farmed the said land and had reaped the crops therefrom.<\/p><p>The record does not clearly disclose upon what theory the land in\u00a0 question was attached and sold as the land of Pedro Triunfo.\u00a0 The plaintiff admits that his right to\u00a0 said land was only the right of a\u00a0 mortgagee.\u00a0\u00a0 There is no attempt to shdw that he had\u00a0 ever foreclosed\u00a0 his mortgage and had obtained title to the\u00a0 land.\u00a0 The fact that the land was sold as the property of Pedro Triunfo will\u00a0 in no way affect the rights of Lope Torrecampo\u00a0 under\u00a0 his mortgage.\u00a0 If his mortgage is a valid lien upon the property, then, notwithstanding the fact that\u00a0 the land\u00a0 has been sold under the writ of execution subsequent to the creation of his mortgage lien, this will in no way affect his lien upon the property.\u00a0 Of course he mu st establish the fact that his mortgage was a valid mortgage,\u00a0 constituting a\u00a0 valid lien\u00a0 upon the property in question.<\/p><p>As was said above the record does not clearly disclose what right or interest\u00a0 Pedro\u00a0 Triunfo had in the land\u00a0 in question at the time of\u00a0 the attachment and sale.\u00a0\u00a0 He presents no objection here to said attachment and sale; neither does the mortgagor, Estefanio Vargas Rojas,\u00a0 present any objection\u00a0 to\u00a0 the\u00a0 land\u00a0\u00a0 having been sold under\u00a0 the\u00a0 said execution.<\/p><p>Accepting the allegations of the plaintiff with reference to his alleged mortgage upon the land in question as a fact, yet, nevertheless, this fact\u00a0 is not sufficient\u00a0 to\u00a0 justify his recovery of the land in question in the present case.\u00a0 If his mortgage is a valid\u00a0 mortgage upon the land, constituting a prior lien to the attachment and sale, the said\u00a0 attachment and sale in no way affected\u00a0 his lien.\u00a0 He still has his right to enforce his\u00a0 lien against\u00a0 the\u00a0 property in\u00a0 question, in a proper action therefor, but the facts disclosed in the record are not sufficient to justify his physical\u00a0 recovery of\u00a0 the land in question.<\/p><p>Therefore the judgment\u00a0 of the\u00a0 lower court is hereby affirmed, with costs.<\/p><p><em> Torres, Mapa,<\/em> and <em>Carson, JJ.<\/em>, concur.<\/p><p><em>Moreland, J<\/em>., concurs with the dispositive part.<\/p><\/div>",

this action was No. 468 in the Court of First Instance of Ambos Camarines.\u00a0 In the said cause\u00a0 Sinforoso Dondis\u00a0 and Francisco Samesa\u00a0 intervened, and it was found that\u00a0 Dondis had sold the property, the subject matter of the complaint, to Juliana Mendizabal, and that Samesa had sold it\u00a0 to\u00a0 Dondis.\u00a0 In the said case, according to the findings, Dondis knew that Garay had died prior to the time when he (Dondis)\u00a0 purchased the property from\u00a0 Samesa, and that\u00a0 Samesa\u00a0 and Dondis had proceeded with the sale,\u00a0 knowing of the death of Garay, and with no other purpose than that of defrauding the latter's legitimate heirs.<br\/><br\/>After the case just above cited, another action was prosecuted, No. 604, in the same\u00a0 court,\u00a0 as the result of a complaint filed by the same Nemesio Reyes, also as administrator of the estate of Felipe Garay,\u00a0 against Francisco Samesa and Sinforoso Dondis\u00a0 for losses\u00a0 and\u00a0 damages\u00a0 for depriving Garay's estate of the revenues of the said property through sale of the\u00a0 same to Juliana Mendizabal; upon the termination of the trial, Francisco Samesa and Sinforoso Dondis were sentenced to pay, jointly and severally, to the intestate estate, as an indemnity for losses and\u00a0 damages, the sum of P5,150.75, which judgment was\u00a0 based on the same finding as that established in the preceding case to\u00a0 wit, that the said two defendants, Samesa and Dondis, had made a fraudulent transfer of the property.<br\/><br\/>This judgment was assented\u00a0 to and became\u00a0 executory, and in proceeding with its execution the sheriff levied upon some property belonging to Sinforoso Dondis, consisting of two rural estates situated, one of them in Camagaca and the other in Ynascan, both of which places are <i>sitios<\/i> of the\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 pueblo of Buhi in Ambos Camarines, and afterwards sold them at public auction to the administrator of the intestate estate, Nemesio Reyes.<br\/><br\/>All the preceding fact were presented as evidence in this case, No. 974 of the same court, prosecuted by Roman Ayles and Vicenta Panga for the recovery of possession of the said two rural properties sold at public auction as belonging to Sinforoso Dondis, the herein plaintiffs alleging that they belonged to them and not to Sinforoso Dondis.<br\/><br\/>The properties, the\u00a0 subject of the present suit, situated as aforesaid, one of them\u00a0 in Camagaca and\u00a0 the other\u00a0 in Ynascan of the\u00a0 pueblo of Buhi in Ambos Camarines, are sufficiently described in the complaint and, as regards their identity, there is not\u00a0 the least disagreement\u00a0 between the parties.\u00a0 The identity of the land being admitted, the litigating parties have raised the issue of the real ownership and possession thereof, that is, the question as to in whom such ownership and possession resided at the time the said properties were attached and sold\u00a0 at\u00a0 public\u00a0 auction\u00a0 and\u00a0 were acquired by the defendant Nemesio Reyes who undoubtedly holds them at present.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiffs\u00a0 claim\u00a0 that at the beginning the said lands belonged to Felipe Garay; that Garay during his lifetime sold them to Sinforoso Dondis, about the year 1892,\u00a0 and that the latter, on September 5, 1905, sold them to\u00a0 Roman Ayles and Vicenta Panga who, it appears, are his wife's parents.<br\/><br\/>After the hearing of the case the court pronounced judgment against the\u00a0 plaintiffs, finding that they had no interest whatever in the two disputed rural properties, and ordered the case dismissed, with the costs against them.<br\/><br\/>From this judgment the plaintiffs appealed and forwarded to this court their bill\u00a0 of exceptions with right to a review of the evidence.\u00a0 On\u00a0 the hearing of the appeal and from the pleadings made before us by both parties, it has been found that two assignments of error have been made against the judgment of the lower court, to wit:<br\/><ol type=\"1\"><li>That the judgment is contrary to law, inasmuch as it is not legally founded on the evidence adduced at the trial.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>That it was found therein that the defendant Nemesio Reyes was entitled to the possession of the land in question, notwithstanding that the\u00a0 evidence clearly showed that the plaintiffs were unquestionably entitled to the ownership of the same.<\/li><\/ol>The appellants base the first alleged error on the fact that, as they acquired the two rural properties aforementioned for a valuable consideration,\u00a0 such\u00a0 an alienation could only be presumed to be fraudulent if a condemnatory judgment had been\u00a0 previously rendered against the transferrer\u00a0 in\u00a0 any instance, or a writ of\u00a0 seizure of property had\u00a0 been\u00a0 issued (art.\u00a0 1297,\u00a0 Civil Code) ; and since no condemnatory judgment, in any instance, had been\u00a0 rendered nor any writ of seizure of property issued against Sinforoso Dondis, the man who alienated the property, before he did it, the conclusion follows,\u00a0 in\u00a0 accordance with\u00a0 the aforecited article\u00a0 of the Civil\u00a0 Code,\u00a0 that such alienation could not be\u00a0 considered fraudulent.<br\/><br\/>They further allege: (1) That the sale made by Sinforoso Dondis to Vicenta Panga\u00a0 took place\u00a0 on April 1, 1902;\u00a0 (2) that on September 5,\u00a0 1905,\u00a0 Dondis wished to execute\u00a0 and did execute a public instrument of\u00a0 the said sale, on the demand of the purchaser\u00a0 herself; (3) That the\u00a0 judgment against Sinforoso Dondis, in case No. 468, was not rendered until\u00a0 January 29, 1906,\u00a0 and in case No.\u00a0 604,\u00a0 not until January\u00a0 14, 1907.\u00a0\u00a0 So that, according to the appellants, when\u00a0 Dondis\u00a0 made\u00a0 the alienation in\u00a0 favor of Panga,\u00a0 no condemnatory judgment\u00a0 had been\u00a0 rendered\u00a0 or writ of seizure of property\u00a0 issued against the former,\u00a0 and, consequently, the transfer\u00a0 could not be deemed to be fraudulent under the legal provision before cited.<br\/><br\/>The question before the court was\u00a0 purely one of fact, and was\u00a0 simply\u00a0 whether Sinforoso Dondis had really sold, on the date claimed by the plaintiffs,\u00a0 the two rural properties in\u00a0 dispute.<br\/><br\/>The proof\u00a0 presented by\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiffs\u00a0 consists\u00a0 of an instrument of sale, apparently executed by Sinforoso Dondis in favor\u00a0 of Vicehta Panga, in Buhi on September 5, 1905, and signed by himself in the\u00a0 presence of the witnesses Roman Ayles and Valerio Portacio.\u00a0 It\u00a0 also appears that Sinforoso Dondis ratified this instrument before the justice of\u00a0 the peace\u00a0 of Buhi who filed the original in his court. This ratification was authenticated by the auxiliary justice of\u00a0 the peace of Buhi, Severino\u00a0 Lancaon, on November 2, 1905.<br\/><br\/>The justice of the peace of Buhi, Juan Carrascoso, testified before the court that the original of that instrument of\u00a0 sale, ratified before the auxiliary justice of the\u00a0 peace, Severino Lancaon, was not among the records of his office, and that only a copy was kept there on\u00a0 file, as it\u00a0 was not the practice of the said justice of the\u00a0 peace court to keep the original, which was left with the executor.\u00a0 Upon this witness being asked by the court before whom\u00a0 he was testifying, as to whether he had had an opportunity to see the original, he replied:\u00a0 \"One morning I was at Dondis' house, in 1906,\u00a0 if I am not mistaken, and among other things he spoke to me of the matter between himself and Garay, and sent to fetch the document from the house\u00a0 of Vicenta Panga, who lived near by, and I saw that amendment in that document,\"\u00a0\u00a0 And\u00a0 <i>that\u00a0 amendment <\/i> is the one\u00a0 he previously mentioned in his testimony in the following terms: \"I can not state precisely whether it was the same date\u00a0 (September 5, 1905); I only observed that there was a certain amendment\u00a0 in the document in front of the year,\u00a0 and I\u00a0 can not say whether this amendment was in the ratification or in the date of the document, and instead of 1905 he erased the 5 and put 4.\"<br\/><br\/>And this in substance is what\u00a0 the defendant,\u00a0 Nemesio Reyes, categorically stated in his testimony: \"and the true date of that document was 1905, and they changed\u00a0 it to 1904.\"<br\/><br\/>Moreover, the trial court took\u00a0 into account the oral testimony, and found the preponderance to be in favor of the evidence\u00a0 given by Ramon Constancio and Nemesio Reyes, the\u00a0 first of whom testified that prior to 1902 and subsequent thereto and until the said rural\u00a0 properties were attached, Roman\u00a0 Ayles\u00a0 was merely Dondis' representative in the matter of their cultivation, and that it was he who grave provisions to the cultivators of the hemp when they went to\u00a0 the mountains, and also paid them.\u00a0 This\u00a0 witness, on cross-examination by the defense, testified that Dondis had stated to him that he (Dondis) had sold the said estates to Roman Ayles when they endeavored to attach his (Dondis') property, and\u00a0 when\u00a0 questioned anew on direct examination, the witness replied:\u00a0 \"*\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 including\u00a0 a document which Mr. Dondis showed me confidentially,\u00a0 putting down the name of Roman Ayles, as\u00a0 a reliable person, because they were not yet married and were merely living together; and, in order to avoid being served with an attachment, he made a private instrument and showed it to me, and I told him that all\u00a0 that was of no value and that the attachment would be\u00a0 served\u00a0 upon him just the\u00a0 same.\"\u00a0\u00a0 Question: \"Then, on that date, Dondis was still the owner of those parcels of land, but by means of that document he wished to convey them to Roman Ayles in order to avoid that attachment on\u00a0 the part of Garay's administrator?\"\u00a0 Answer: \"Yes.\"<br\/><br\/>The trial\u00a0 court arrived\u00a0 at\u00a0 the conclusion that Dondis, from his antecedents,\u00a0 was a person capable of falsifying documents and of performing any fraudulent\u00a0 act which might be of\u00a0 benefit to himself, inasmuch as it was clearly shown, during the time that he was testifying as a witness in\u00a0 these several\u00a0 cases,\u00a0 that\u00a0 his testimony\u00a0 was\u00a0 false. \"Taking\u00a0 these\u00a0 facts\u00a0 into\u00a0 consideration,\" the\u00a0 trial court continues, \"jointly with the fact that Dondis and the plaintiffs are\u00a0 relatives and that they have lived together, I am convinced that\u00a0 the sale made by Dondis in\u00a0 favor of the plaintiff\u00a0 was\u00a0 made fraudulently and that both parties knew of this fact, their intention being to avoid the attachment, and\u00a0 that both\u00a0 knew that\u00a0 Dondis had no other property wherewith to satisfy that judgment.\"\u00a0 Concluding, it says: \"The plaintiff,\u00a0 being\u00a0 an accessory\u00a0 to the said\u00a0 fraudulent conveyance, did not acquire any right or title to the lands in question,\u00a0 and, the said conveyance having been made with the intention of\u00a0 defrauding\u00a0 the\u00a0 heirs of Garay, it\u00a0 is null and void and of no value, and the sheriff did really sell the interests and. rights of Dondis\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\"\u00a0\u00a0 (pp. 12 and 13, bill of exceptions).<br\/><br\/>With respect to the conclusions reached by\u00a0 the\u00a0 lower court from this preponderance of evidence, this court finds no error, either\u00a0 of\u00a0 fact or\u00a0 of law, to justify\u00a0 a contrary judgment.<br\/><br\/>And, moreover, in\u00a0 the\u00a0 consideration of this\u00a0 court due weight is accorded\u00a0 to the construction\u00a0 which\u00a0 should\u00a0 be given to article 1297 of the Civil Code, to wit, that fraud in conveyances may be proved by means different and independent from the cases of <i>presumption <\/i> established in\u00a0 article 1297;\u00a0 and the trial\u00a0 court\u00a0 having held, from the whole\u00a0 of the evidence, independent\u00a0 of such presumptions, that the debtor went into\u00a0 a complete state of insolvency, selling the property in\u00a0 question to his wife's parents, and that the sales were simulated, the\u00a0 purchasers being accomplices\u00a0 in the fraud - all with the purpose\u00a0 of frustrating the legitimate\u00a0 rights pertaining\u00a0\u00a0 to the Garay estate,\u00a0 and the liabilities contracted - it is obvious that there was\u00a0 no infringement of the said article and the doctrine connected therewith, invoked on appeal, in which by putting the question hypothetically and maintaining, against the opinion\u00a0 of the lower court, that fraud on\u00a0 the part of the vendor was not proved. (Decision in cassation, supreme court of Spain, May 16, 1904.) For\u00a0 the foregoing reasons, the\u00a0 judgment appealed from is affirmed, with\u00a0 the costs\u00a0 of this instance against the appellants.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i> Torres, Mapa, Carson,<\/i> and <i>Moreland, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><\/div>",

recovered.<br\/><br\/>The prosecution asserts that the appellant, Arcadio Bernales, was the person who induced his coadjutors to commit the crime and that he received the greater\u00a0 part of the booty.\u00a0\u00a0 In support of its contention the prosecution presented as a witness Guillermo\u00a0 Bula,\u00a0 one\u00a0 of those who took part\u00a0 in the robbery, who related in detail the facts constituting the commission\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 crime, including the part\u00a0 taken\u00a0 by the appellant as an inducer,\u00a0 and the subsequent division of the property between the criminals.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 testimony\u00a0 of\u00a0 this witness was richly\u00a0 corroborated by\u00a0 many\u00a0 circumstances surrounding the transaction which\u00a0 were\u00a0 drawn from other witnesses and sources during the trial.\u00a0\u00a0 It was shown that one of the sacks, containing the sum of P308.05,\u00a0 which was a part of the spoils of the robbery, was found buried beneath the house where the\u00a0 appellant was accustomed\u00a0 to\u00a0 go\u00a0 frequently\u00a0 and in the very\u00a0 spot where, after the robbery, he had been seated on his heels engaged\u00a0 in something.<br\/><br\/>The appellant\u00a0 limited his defense to a\u00a0 simple denial that he had anything whatever to do with\u00a0 the crime\u00a0 or its perpetrators and asserted that he knew\u00a0 nothing whatever of the\u00a0 robbery.\u00a0 His denial is corroborated by two of his coaccused, Anastacio Bernales and Candelario Budiao.\u00a0 The question to be determined is whether or not the denial of the appellant and of these two witnesses, who, it must be remembered, were convicted and sentenced but did not appeal, is overcome by the testimony of Guillermo Bula, corroborated as it is by certain suspicious circumstances, including the fact, above noted, that\u00a0 part of the stolen money was found buried in the place where the appellant was\u00a0 seen seated on his heels engaged in\u00a0 doing something.<br\/><br\/>Guillermo Bula, 39 years of age, married, and a resident of the barrio of Cogon, municipality of Panitan, testified that on Tuesday, the day of the\u00a0 crime, his coaccused, Anastacio Bernales, came to his\u00a0 house and, under the pretext of obtaining his\u00a0 aid in certain work, induced him to accompany him to his house in Pontevedra, where he found the appellant and the other coaccused,\u00a0 Candelario Budiao.\u00a0 There\u00a0 these individuals revealed to the witness their purpose to rob the Chinese merchants that were about to start from Pontevedra for Capiz.\u00a0 That as witness made objections to the danger which\u00a0 was to be met in such action, they\u00a0 assured him\u00a0 that the boteros\u00a0 who were to accompany the merchants\u00a0 were cognizant of their purposes and would offer no objection or resistance whatever.<br\/><br\/>Having been finally induced by the appellant and his companions to assist his coaccused to commit the robbery,\u00a0 the witnesses, Anastacio and Candelario, started immediately in a <i>baroto<\/i>,\u00a0 proceeding to the place where the robbery was committed.\u00a0 There\u00a0 they lay in wait for the Chinamen and, when they arrived, surprised and assaulted them and robbed them of the\u00a0 trunk which contained their money.\u00a0 The crime consummated, they immediately returned to the house where they had left the appellant.\u00a0 Arriving there, they awoke the appellant, who immediately\u00a0 joined the three in the\u00a0 <i>baroto,<\/i> and the four ascended the river, where they disembarked and, carrying the trunk ashore, it was at once taken possession of by Arcadio, who broke it open and took from it the sacks containing the money.\u00a0\u00a0 Opening the various sacks the appellant took all of the paper money which they contained and put it in his pocket, saying to his three companions that this\u00a0 kind of money was\u00a0 not proper for them.\u00a0 He then divided the silver money into seven separate portions, corresponding to the seven individuals, including himself, who had taken part in the enterprise.\u00a0 Of these seven portions one was delivered to Anastacio, another to Candelario, and one to the witness.\u00a0 Arcadio took charge of the four remaining portions.\u00a0\u00a0 The witness\u00a0 received\u00a0 three\u00a0 bundles\u00a0 of 50 pesos each and four of 25 pesos each, making a total of P250, Soon\u00a0 thereafter the witness returned to his own\u00a0 barrio, arriving there about 2 o'clock of the night.\u00a0 Two days later Anastacio came again to the witness's house and the latter accompanied him to Dumarao, leaving his P250 in the care of his wife.\u00a0 In Dumarao Anastacio\u00a0 and the witness separated, the former going to Passi and the witness to Tinay-tan.\u00a0\u00a0 Before separating, Anastacio gave to the witness P26 to take to his wife, because Anastacio had not given her any part of the booty, the result of the robbery.\u00a0\u00a0 While he was still in Tinaytan the witness was arrested and the money which had thus been delivered to him by Anastacio fell into the hands of the Constabulary.<br\/><br\/>Paula\u00a0 Cordenillo, wife of Guillermo Bula and sister-in-law of Anastacio Bernales,\u00a0 corroborated\u00a0 her husband by asserting in\u00a0 her testimony\u00a0 that Anastacio\u00a0 came to her house on a certain day in\u00a0 April and that the following day her husband came home with P250.\u00a0\u00a0 He buried the money, but it was found later by Guillermo Daynato and Eustaquio Delgado.<br\/><br\/>Guillermo Daynato testified that on the 19th day of April he went to the barrio of Cogon and recovered P250 which had been buried in\u00a0 a place that was pointed out to him by Paula Cordenillo, wife of Guillermo Bula.\u00a0\u00a0 The following day the witness found another sum of Pl50 that had been buried near the place where\u00a0 he found the P250.\u00a0\u00a0 The place\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 where the P150 was\u00a0 buried\u00a0 was pointed out to him by an old woman\u00a0 called\u00a0 Juana, mother-in-law of Anastacio Bernales.<br\/><br\/>Pelagio Visnal, <i>presidente <\/i>of Pontevedra, testified\u00a0 that the wife of Benito Buaron\u00a0 (one of the convicted <i>boteros<\/i>) told him that a child called Fermin Buaron, brother of Benito Buaron, had\u00a0 asserted that he, the child, had\u00a0 seen Arcadio Bernales burying something one night under his house.\u00a0 Acting upon this information the witness went to the house in question, in company with the child\u00a0 Fermin, who indicated the place where he had\u00a0 seen the appellant, Arcadio Bernales, engaged in burying something.\u00a0 On excavating in the\u00a0 place indicated by\u00a0 the child the witness found\u00a0 a sack of\u00a0 money\u00a0 containing P308.05.\u00a0\u00a0 The witness further stated that although he had known the appellant a long time he had never known of his having engaged in any kind of trade or occupation,\u00a0 but supposed that he worked in his\u00a0 house.<br\/><br\/>Ten\u00a0 Lua, one\u00a0 of the\u00a0 Chinese merchants\u00a0 who were the victims of the\u00a0 robbery,\u00a0 testified that P750 of the money stolen\u00a0 belonged to him; that the money was contained in sacks placed in a trunk; that said trunk was taken from him and his companions by violence by the witness Guillermo Bula and the two coaccused, Anastacio Bernales and Candelario Budiao; that the\u00a0 robbery\u00a0 was committed about\u00a0 8 o'clock of the evening of the 13th\u00a0 day of April while he and his companions were going to Capiz in\u00a0 a<i> baroto<\/i>.\u00a0 On being\u00a0 shown the sack\u00a0 which had been found under the house where the appellant had been seen burying something, the witness recognized\u00a0 it as\u00a0 one of the sacks, which\u00a0 had contained the stolen money.<br\/><br\/>Of the total sum of P2,150, two sums, one of P180\u00a0 and another of P24,\u00a0 making in all P204,\u00a0 consisted of paper money. The rest was silver.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 child Fermin, to whom the <i>presidente <\/i> of Pontevedra referred in his declaration, testified that he was a\u00a0 brother of the botero Benito Buaron, one of the convicted robbers; that the appellant lived with the brothers of the\u00a0 witness, Benito and Eladio, and the accused Vicente Balida, brother-in-law of Benito; that after the witness learned of the commission of the robbery, he saw the appellant doing something under the house of the latter's mother-in-law, a woman called Aya, where later was found the money which had been buried. Upon the testimony thus presented the learned trial court found the appellant guilty as\u00a0 one\u00a0 of the authors\u00a0 of the crime charged and\u00a0 sentenced him accordingly.\u00a0 There remains no shadow of doubt that the appellant is guilty of the crime charged.\u00a0 While the testimony of an accomplice,\u00a0 or of a principal against a fellow criminal, is to\u00a0 be taken\u00a0 with caution and weighed with care, it is, nevertheless, true that such testimony may, in a proper case, be used as the basis of a conviction.\u00a0\u00a0 In\u00a0 this\u00a0 case\u00a0 the testimony of the\u00a0 witness Guillermo Bula is so thoroughly and decisively corroborated and supported by\u00a0 the testimony of other witnesses\u00a0 and by the circumstances\u00a0 surrounding\u00a0 the\u00a0 transaction from its beginning\u00a0 to\u00a0 its close,\u00a0 and even up to and\u00a0 including the arrest of the defendants, that there remains no doubt of the truthfulness of the witness in giving that testimony.\u00a0 The penalty imposed being within the limits prescribed\u00a0 by the law, the judgment\u00a0 of conviction and the\u00a0 sentence imposed thereunder\u00a0 are affirmed, with costs against\u00a0 the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

FRANCISCO REYES, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/>\n<br\/>\nD E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">This is an appeal by the defendant from\u00a0 a judgment of conviction\u00a0 rendered in this cause by the Honorable Judge Simplicio del Rosario.<p>At dusk on the evening of June 26,1910, Lorenza Cornejo, a girl of about 15 years of age, unmarried, left her house, situated\u00a0 in the pueblo of Pasay, Province of Rizal, to return some flags which she had borrowed, and\u00a0 while returning home was\u00a0 approached by\u00a0 Francisco Reyes,\u00a0 who for some time past had been courting her, making\u00a0 her promises of marriage, and who had arranged with her to\u00a0 accompany him to this city\u00a0 for\u00a0 the purpose of getting married.\u00a0 On meeting, as aforesaid, Reyes insisted on\u00a0 Lorenza's going away with\u00a0 him,\u00a0 and accordingly\u00a0 advised\u00a0 her to go alone to the street-car station, saying that he would follow her, so that no one might see them traveling together; but from the street named Daan-bago they went along together to the street-car station where they took a car for this city and went to the\u00a0 house\u00a0 of Jose\u00a0 Torno, situated on Calle Cervantes,\u00a0 and\u00a0 there they remained and lived together conjugally\u00a0 for more than fifteen\u00a0 days, until\u00a0 they were found by the girl's mother, Cirila Escobar, and a policeman. It is to be\u00a0 noted that, during the time Reyes and Lorenza stayed\u00a0 in Calle Cervantes, the former\u00a0 had\u00a0 carnal intercourse\u00a0 with the latter about ten\u00a0 times;\u00a0 that, whenever the abducted girl demanded of her abductor that he fulfill his promise of marriage, he would reply that his\u00a0 mother was looking for some\u00a0 influential person who might speak to Lorenza's mother; and that the\u00a0 girl\u00a0 afterwards\u00a0 learned from her own mother that\u00a0 the defendant\u00a0 was married, wherefore she denounced the facts to the authorities.<\/p><p>The provincial fiscal,\u00a0 therefore, in view of the preliminary examination made\u00a0 by\u00a0 the justice\u00a0 of the\u00a0 peace court of Pasay, filed an information in the Court of First Instance of the province, charging Francisco Reyes with the crime of abduction, and the court, after due consideration of the proofs and other evidence, rendered judgment, on January 9 of this year, sentencing the defendant to the penalty of two years eleven months\u00a0 and ten days of <em> prision\u00a0 correccional<\/em>, to pay an indemnity of P3,000 to\u00a0 the offended party, Lorenza Cornejo, and, in case of insolvency, to the corresponding subsidiary\u00a0 imprisonment, in conformity with article 50, rule 1, of the Penal\u00a0 Code, to\u00a0 pay the\u00a0 costs, and to suffer the other penalties specified in\u00a0 the said judgment.<\/p><p>From the facts aforerelated, duly proved in this cause, it is concluded that\u00a0 the crime of abduction\u00a0 was committed against the person of a maiden of over 12 and under 23 years\u00a0 of age, with her\u00a0 consent and\u00a0 with unchaste designs, a\u00a0 crime provided for and punished by\u00a0 article 446\u00a0 of the Penal Code.\u00a0\u00a0 This conclusion\u00a0 follows from\u00a0 the\u00a0 evidence which clearly proves that Francisco Reyes, from the\u00a0 month of February, 1910,\u00a0 used\u00a0 to visit frequently\u00a0 at the house of Cirila Escobar, situated in the pueblo\u00a0 of Pasay, to court the latter's daughter, Lorenza\u00a0 Cornejo,\u00a0 and,\u00a0 by\u00a0 means of cajolery and\u00a0 promises of marriage, succeeded in seducing the young girl, who, induced\u00a0 by the defendant, left her mother's house to return a borrowed article, and,\u00a0 following her abductor's\u00a0 instructions, went alone toward the\u00a0 street-car station in\u00a0 that pueblo; when she arrived at the new highway she was joined\u00a0 by the\u00a0 defendant and together they boarded a street car\u00a0 bound for this city and lodged at the house of Jose Torno, situated on Calle Cervantes, now Rizal\u00a0 Avenue, where they were caught\u00a0 together by the girl's mother\u00a0 and a\u00a0 policeman, between\u00a0 11 and 12 o'clock of the night of the 20th of the following month of July, when they were\u00a0 sitting together on\u00a0 a bed in a room\u00a0 of the house; Reyes was wearing a Chinese <em>camisa<\/em>, and the girl a chemisette tucked under her skirt, as testified by Cirila Escobar, the mother of the abducted girl, who had been looking for her daughter from the night\u00a0 of June 26, 1910,\u00a0 the date of her disappearance,\u00a0 and who\u00a0 for that purpose came\u00a0 daily to this\u00a0 city, seeking in the\u00a0 suburbs, and even in the pueblo of Malabon, information\u00a0 of the girl's whereabouts,\u00a0 until at\u00a0 last,\u00a0 accompanied by a policeman from Pasay, she succeeded in finding her daughter and the defendant in the aforementioned house\u00a0 of Jose Torno, on Calle Cervantes.<\/p><p>The departure of the abducted girl\u00a0 from the\u00a0 place of her residence\u00a0 and\u00a0 her ride\u00a0 to this city in\u00a0 a street\u00a0 car, accompanied by her abductor, the defendant Reyes, is proved by the testimony of Telesforo Pestanas, who saw them going\u00a0 along the street together toward the\u00a0 street-car\u00a0 station, and also by the testimony of Miguela de Guzman, who saw the girl that same evening going toward the street-car station in the\u00a0 company of a man whom the witness did not know.\u00a0 The\u00a0 policeman,\u00a0 Eugenio Wenceslao,\u00a0 corroborated the testimony of Cirila Escobar,\u00a0 whom he accompanied when they surprised\u00a0 Lorenza\u00a0 Cornejo and her abductor Reyes\u00a0 in\u00a0 a room of\u00a0 Jose Torno's house on Calle Cervantes and\u00a0 found them then and there sitting together on a bed, dressed in their underclothes.\u00a0 The owners of the house, Jose Torno and Aurelia Ligdao, corroborated the testimony given relative to the stay in their house of the abductor and the abducted, as well as to the fact that the two latter were caught therein by a policeman and the offended girl's mother.<\/p><p>Although the abducted girl was not\u00a0 forcibly\u00a0 removed from the house by her abductor on the evening of the said 26th of June, yet it is unquestionable that\u00a0 she, through cajolery, left\u00a0 her mother's house,\u00a0 by prearfangement with the\u00a0 defendant and at his bidding, inasmuch as he awaited her\u00a0 on the road\u00a0 and they came together to this city and hid themselves from that time to the 20th of July following when\u00a0 they were\u00a0 caught together in the house where they were lodging. It is therefore beyond all\u00a0 doubt that the defendant, Reyes, took with him the girl Lorenza Cornejo, with unchaste designs and under\u00a0 a false promise of marriage, made deceitfully and in bad faith, since, as\u00a0 he was married,\u00a0 he\u00a0 knew that\u00a0 he\u00a0 could\u00a0 not possibly marry the abducted girl.<\/p><p>The crime of abduction, with unchaste designs and the consent of the abducted, was consummated,\u00a0 because the girl\u00a0 left her mother's house, gave herself up\u00a0 to her abductor and\u00a0 lived with him\u00a0 conjugally until they were arrested in the house where, according to the testimony\u00a0 of the abducted girl, the defendant had carnal intercourse with her no less than ten times; therefore, it is undeniable that the abduction\u00a0 was committed in the manner\u00a0 aforestated.<\/p><p>In a decision of November 30, 1875, the\u00a0 supreme court of Spain,\u00a0 in the matter of the application, in an analogous case, of the provisions of article\u00a0 461\u00a0 of the\u00a0 Penal\u00a0 Code of that country,\u00a0 identical to\u00a0 those\u00a0 of article 446\u00a0 of the code in force in\u00a0 these Islands, established the\u00a0 following principle:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"The purpose of the law is not to punish the wrong done to the girl, provided that she consents thereto, but\u00a0 to prescribe punishment for the disgrace to her family and the alarm caused\u00a0 therein by the\u00a0 disappearance\u00a0 of one who is, by her age and\u00a0 sex,\u00a0 susceptible\u00a0 to cajolery\u00a0 and\u00a0 deceit. The\u00a0 place being immaterial,\u00a0 no mention is\u00a0 made of\u00a0 it in the Penal Code.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The same principle is laid down\u00a0 in the decisions of October 29, 1895, and March 31, 1896.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding,\u00a0 then, that Lorenza Cornejo was not forcibly taken from her mother's house, yet the crime of abduction was\u00a0 committed, for it is not necessary that\u00a0 it should have been perpetrated in\u00a0 that\u00a0 manner, it being sufficient that the girl should have left, as she did, removing herself from her mother's custody and yielding to the cajolery, inducement, and promises of her abductor, who took her away with\u00a0 unchaste designs.<\/p><p>The defendant denied the charge and pleaded not guilty, but notwithstanding\u00a0 the\u00a0 allegations\u00a0 made in\u00a0 his defense and the testimony of the witnesses presented in his behalf, the record shows decisive and conclusive proof\u00a0 of his guilt, beyond\u00a0 all reasonable doubt,\u00a0 as the\u00a0 sole convicted perpetrator by direct participation of the abduction under prosecution;\u00a0 this is shown by the\u00a0 statements of two witnesses who saw the abducted girl walk away from the\u00a0 town where her mother's house is situated and in which she was living on the\u00a0 afternoon of\u00a0 June 26, 1910, accompanied\u00a0 by her abductor,\u00a0 the defendant,\u00a0 and go\u00a0 in\u00a0 the direction of the street-car station; it is also\u00a0 shown\u00a0 by\u00a0 the\u00a0 corroborative testimony of the abducted girl's mother,\u00a0 who set out to look for her daughter, from\u00a0 early in the evening of the said date, in various parts of this city and of the Province of Rizal, until at last she found the abductor and the abducted together sitting on a bed in a room of Torno's house; this\u00a0 testimony\u00a0 was\u00a0 also corroborated\u00a0 by the policeman Eugenio Wenceslao who accompanied the mother, and all of this testimony was likewise corroborated by the owners of the house, Jose\u00a0 Torno and Aurelia\u00a0 Ligdao; these two witnesses, however,\u00a0 in\u00a0 affirming the facts above related, gave certain reasons\u00a0 therefor which the court upon very good grounds, deemed unworthy of belief.\u00a0 The averment by Marcelino de la Virgen can not be\u00a0 held to have been proven,\u00a0 which was to the effect that the mother of the abducted girl charged him to tell\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant that he should give her P2,000, else he would be prosecuted.\u00a0\u00a0 This statement is unsupported by\u00a0 proof and\u00a0 was\u00a0 denied by Cirila Escobar,\u00a0 the\u00a0 mother\u00a0 of the\u00a0 offended\u00a0 party, who added that it was the witness Virgen who used to accompany the defendant to her house and also deceived her by assuring her that Francisco Reyes was\u00a0 a bachelor.<\/p><p>The\u00a0 readiness\u00a0 with which the girl\u00a0 Lorenza Cornejo, obeying the instructions\u00a0 of her\u00a0 abductor and his mother, testified against her own interests and those of her mother, affords a\u00a0 criterion\u00a0 whereby\u00a0 to\u00a0 gauge the readiness with which she allowed herself to be seduced\u00a0 by\u00a0 her abductor under the promise of marriage, which could not be fulfilled because the defendant was then\u00a0 a married man.<\/p><p>In the commission\u00a0 of\u00a0 the crime there is\u00a0 no attendant extenuating or\u00a0 aggravating\u00a0 circumstance to consider; so the\u00a0 judgment of the lower court, the grounds in support of which we accept, is in accordance with the law and the merits of the case.<\/p><p>Therefore we are of opinion that\u00a0 the judgment of conviction appealed from should be and is hereby\u00a0 affirmed; provided,\u00a0 however,\u00a0 that\u00a0 the defendant,\u00a0 Francisco Reyes, shall be sentenced to the penalty of one\u00a0 year\u00a0 eight months and\u00a0 twenty-one days of<em> prision correecional,<\/em> to the accessories\u00a0 of article\u00a0 61, to\u00a0 pay an indemnity\u00a0 of P1,000 to the offended party, Lorenza Cornejo,\u00a0 and, in\u00a0 case of insolvency, to the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment, which shall not exceed one-third of the principal penalty, to support the offspring,\u00a0 should there be any, and to pay the costs.\u00a0 So ordered.<\/p><p><em>Mapa, Johnson, Carson,<\/em> and <em>Trent, JJ.<\/em>, concur.<\/p><\/div>",

that it was the owner\u00a0 of a pier for\u00a0 the service of steamers at the port of Tacloban, Leyte,\u00a0 which pier was acquired from the defunct commercial house\u00a0 of Pablo\u00a0 Ortiga, to whose business,\u00a0 real and\u00a0 personal properties, rights\u00a0 and actions the\u00a0 plaintiffs succeeded\u00a0 and\u00a0 of which they took charge\u00a0 by virtue of an agreement between the heirs of the deceased Ortiga who were then the members of the plaintiff company; that\u00a0 the defendant Francisco Enage, the sheriff of the Province\u00a0 of Leyte, on or about the 8th of November, 1908,\u00a0 through his deputy, Cornelio Manalo,\u00a0 and\u00a0 in\u00a0 compliance\u00a0 with\u00a0 an order of execution issued\u00a0 by\u00a0 the\u00a0 Court of 'First\u00a0 Instance\u00a0 of\u00a0 Manila,\u00a0\u00a0 at the\u00a0 request\u00a0 of the\u00a0 defendant,\u00a0 Yap\u00a0 Tico,\u00a0 against\u00a0 the property of Juana\u00a0 Mercado, Felix\u00a0 Villa and\u00a0 the minors Mercedes, Julian,\u00a0 Felisa\u00a0 and\u00a0 Joaquina\u00a0 Villa, attached the undivided half\u00a0 of the said pier, for the reason that one-half\u00a0 of\u00a0 the same belonged to the judgment debtors aforementioned; and\u00a0 notwithstanding\u00a0 that the proper\u00a0 affidavit was presented to the sheriff by the\u00a0 plaintiff\u00a0 firm in order\u00a0 that he might desist from attaching the said half of the\u00a0 pier of the firm's exclusive ownership, and, though at the beginning the sheriff acceded to its request, yet,\u00a0\u00a0 a bond\u00a0 having been given by\u00a0 Yap Tico to indemnify the sheriff against any claim which\u00a0 might arise\u00a0 by reason of the attachment, this\u00a0 official, on\u00a0 November 23, 1908, proceeded with the attachment of the said undivided half of the pier and endeavored to sell it, according to the notices given, for the purpose of satisfying the judgment rendered by the Court of First\u00a0 Instance of Manila,\u00a0 in favor of Yap Tico and against the\u00a0 said Juana Mercado, Felix Villa and the minors, Mercedes, Julian,\u00a0 Felisa and\u00a0 Joaquina\u00a0 Villa; that these\u00a0 judgment\u00a0 debtors, none of\u00a0 them,\u00a0 at any time held and owned one-half of\u00a0 the\u00a0 said pier, nor were they then,\u00a0 at the time of the\u00a0 presentation of the complaint, 'the possessors\u00a0 and owners thereof,\u00a0 since the said half of the pier belonged to the\u00a0 plaintiff company,\u00a0 who acquired it from\u00a0 the\u00a0 intestate\u00a0 estate of the\u00a0 deceased Ildefonso Villa Lim Yamco by virtue of\u00a0 a\u00a0 conveyance or sale\u00a0 made on August\u00a0 17, 1907, through the administratrix of the said estate to the\u00a0 aforementioned firm of Pablo\u00a0 Ortiga,\u00a0 with the authorization of the court, in payment of a part of a certain\u00a0 debt of the estate before\u00a0 referred to; that all the facts\u00a0 alleged by the plaintiff company were known to the defendants, and to\u00a0 each one of them, prior to and at the time\u00a0 of the attachment\u00a0 of the said one-half\u00a0 of\u00a0 the pier, and that, notwithstanding, the\u00a0 defendants, maliciously and with\u00a0 the deliberate intention\u00a0 of\u00a0 prejudicing\u00a0 and injuring the plaintiffs'\u00a0 interests by causing them to incur unnecessary expenses, brought\u00a0 about the attachment of the said property, and on account\u00a0 of\u00a0 such procedure\u00a0 on\u00a0 the part of the defendants and in\u00a0 order that the\u00a0 plaintiffs might protect their interests, the latter had to\u00a0 employ an attorney whose professional fees, amounting to P600, were contracted\u00a0 for and paid,\u00a0 in addition to other expenses; and that the sheriff, unless prevented\u00a0 by the court, would proceed to\u00a0 sell the half of\u00a0 the said pier to the\u00a0 detriment of the plaintiffs' rights,\u00a0 against which act they\u00a0 had not the remedy of appeal, nor any other expeditious remedy; wherefore they prayed the\u00a0 court to issue\u00a0 a writ of injunction against the sheriff, in\u00a0 order\u00a0 that; during\u00a0 the pendency of this claim, he should\u00a0 refrain from\u00a0 selling the said one-half of the pier and desist from executing any act tending to the same\u00a0 purpose.\u00a0 The plaintiffs\u00a0 further prayed that judgment be\u00a0 rendered whereby it be declared that the pier in question is the exclusive property of the plaintiff company and that the attachment levied on the same is unjust and\u00a0 malicious.\u00a0\u00a0 The plaintiffs also asked that the defendants be sentenced to pay to\u00a0 them P600 on account of the expenses incurred, and the costs of the trial.<br\/><br\/>The demurrer to\u00a0 the\u00a0 complaint\u00a0 having been overruled, the defendants in their answer, through their counsel, denied each and all of the allegations contained in each and every paragraph of the said complaint\u00a0 and asked that they be absolved therefrom,\u00a0 with the costs\u00a0 against the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>The defendant, F. M. Yap\u00a0 Tico, appearing separately by counsel, alleged in his amended answer of July 13, 1909, that he\u00a0 denied each\u00a0 and\u00a0 every allegation contained in each and\u00a0 every one of the paragraphs\u00a0 of the complaint; that, as special defenses,\u00a0 he set forth:\u00a0 That the plaintiff party lacked the personality\u00a0 requisite for the prosecution of\u00a0 the action\u00a0 instituted; that one-half of the said\u00a0 pier belonged exclusively to the intestate estate\u00a0 of\u00a0 Ildefonso Villa Lim Yamco,\u00a0 the judicially declared\u00a0 heirs of whom were Juana Mercado,\u00a0 Felix\u00a0 Villa,\u00a0 and the\u00a0 minors, Mercedes,\u00a0 Julian, Felisa\u00a0 and Joaquina Villa,\u00a0 residing in\u00a0 Tanauan,\u00a0 Leyte; that the attachment levied upon the one-half of\u00a0 the said pier, was made at the instance of Juana Mercado\u00a0 as\u00a0 the administratrix\u00a0 of the aforementioned\u00a0 estate and with\u00a0 the approval of the\u00a0 heirs thereof, in order to satisfy the claim held by the defendant Yap Tico against the said estate of Lim Yamco;\u00a0 that, in the highly improbable case that Yap Tico should not\u00a0 be considered as a creditor of the intestate Lim Yamco,\u00a0 but\u00a0 simply of\u00a0 the latter's heirs, he would make no claim to acquire over the said half of the disputed pier any\u00a0 other\u00a0 right,\u00a0 interest\u00a0 and share except such as pertain or may pertain to the\u00a0 said Juana Mercado and other of her coheirs;\u00a0 that the sale or transfer,\u00a0 in payment of the said\u00a0 half of the pier,\u00a0 which the plaintiff alleged had been\u00a0 made in the latter's favor by\u00a0 the\u00a0 administratrix of the intestate estate, Juana Mercado, was effected without the knowledge and authorization of a competent court and, therefore, was null and\u00a0 void, for the said sale or transfer prejudiced and\u00a0 was still prejudicing the interests of the estate of the deceased\u00a0 Lim\u00a0 Yamco, the\u00a0 creditors of the estate and also\u00a0 the heirs of the said deceased,\u00a0 as well as the rights of the creditors\u00a0 of such heirs,\u00a0 by preventing them from realizing upon their claims and with\u00a0 the rights, interest\u00a0 and share which pertained or\u00a0 might\u00a0 pertain to each one and all of the said\u00a0 heirs; and that the defendant had carried on\u00a0 with the plaintiffs\u00a0 friendly negotiations in order to convince them\u00a0 of the reality\u00a0 of his\u00a0 right in the one-half of the\u00a0 said\u00a0 pier, but\u00a0 that\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiffs did not respond to such act of loyalty and unjustly\u00a0 compelled him to maintain\u00a0 the present suit which, if it\u00a0 had\u00a0 not\u00a0 been for the plaintiffs' procedure, he never would have contemplated; wherefore the defendant asked that the complaint be dismissed with the costs against the plaintiff\u00a0 company.<br\/><br\/>The case came to trial, oral evidence\u00a0 was introduced\u00a0 by both\u00a0 parties,\u00a0 the documents\u00a0 exhibited\u00a0 being attached\u00a0 to the record, and the court, on\u00a0 April\u00a0 25, 1910, rendered judgment whereby it found that the\u00a0 one-half of the pier in question belonged to the plaintiff company and\u00a0 not to the judgment debtors, Juana Mercado,\u00a0 Felix, Mercedes, Julian, Joaquina, and Felisa Villa, and that\u00a0 the attachment levied upon\u00a0 the said one-half of the\u00a0 pier was unjust and malicious, sentenced the defendants to\u00a0 pay to the plaintiffs the sum of P600 for the damages caused\u00a0 to the latter\u00a0 by reason of the said attachment, and ordered the sheriff and the other defendant, Yap Tico,\u00a0 to\u00a0 refrain\u00a0 from performing any acts whatsoever tending to the prosecution of the said attachment, with the\u00a0 costs\u00a0 against\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendants.\u00a0 The latter's counsel,\u00a0 having been notified of this judgment, took exception thereto and by a written\u00a0 motion asked for a new trial,\u00a0 on the ground\u00a0 that\u00a0 such judgment was\u00a0 openly and manifestly contrary to the weight of the evidence and to law.\u00a0\u00a0 This motion was overruled and exception\u00a0 was taken by the defendants' counsel,\u00a0 who\u00a0 duly\u00a0 filed the required bill\u00a0 of exceptions, which\u00a0 was\u00a0 approved,\u00a0 certified\u00a0 to\u00a0 and forwarded to the\u00a0 clerk of this court.<br\/><br\/>The writ of execution issued by the Court of\u00a0 First Instance of\u00a0 Manila, at\u00a0 the petition of the\u00a0 Chinaman Yap Tico, was\u00a0 intended to obtain the\u00a0 collection of a debt contracted in favor\u00a0 of the latter\u00a0 by Juana\u00a0 Mercado,\u00a0 Felix, Mercedes,\u00a0 Julian, Felisa and Joaquina Villa,\u00a0 the\u00a0 widow and\u00a0 heirs of the deceased Ildefonso Villa Lim Yamco,\u00a0 and for this\u00a0 purpose the undivided one-half of the pier, used for the service\u00a0 of steamers\u00a0 and constructed\u00a0 at the wharf of the port of Tacloban, was attached by the sheriff of the Province of Leyte, as belonging to the said\u00a0 debtors.<br\/><br\/>The pier\u00a0 aforementioned\u00a0 originally\u00a0 belonged, half\u00a0 to Pablo\u00a0 Ortiga and half to Ildefonso Villa, and\u00a0 when\u00a0 the latter died, on July 16, 1899, the one-half\u00a0 of the said pier was\u00a0 transferred or\u00a0 ceded in payment of\u00a0 a part of what was\u00a0 found to be owing by his\u00a0 intestate estate, to his co-owner, Ortiga, to whose rights the plaintiffs, Ortiga\u00a0 Brothers and\u00a0 Company, in\u00a0 turn\u00a0 succeeded,\u00a0 as\u00a0 shown by\u00a0 the record of proceedings,\u00a0 attached as Exhibit 2, had\u00a0 in\u00a0 the Court\u00a0 of\u00a0 First\u00a0 Instance of\u00a0 Leyte\u00a0 in\u00a0 connection with\u00a0 the settlement\u00a0 of the intestate estate of the aforesaid Ildefonso Villa Lim Yamco.\u00a0 So\u00a0 that the credit for the payment of which\u00a0 an\u00a0 attachment was levied upon the\u00a0 said half\u00a0 of the pier, is not\u00a0 one against the intestate\u00a0 succession of\u00a0 the deceased,\u00a0 Yamco,\u00a0 but\u00a0 against his\u00a0 widow\u00a0 and heirs; and it\u00a0 is not\u00a0 shown in the aforesaid record\u00a0 of proceedings that\u00a0 the judgment creditor,\u00a0 Yap\u00a0 Tico, was a creditor\u00a0 of the said\u00a0 intestate, as no credit whatever\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 name\u00a0 of the said\u00a0 Yap Tico appears among those which were recognized and\u00a0 admitted\u00a0 as legitimate by\u00a0 the committee\u00a0 of appraisal appointed by that court.<br\/><br\/>A person who, having a claim against\u00a0 a\u00a0 deceased person which\u00a0 should be\u00a0 considered by the\u00a0 committee does not, after publication of\u00a0 the required notice, exhibit his\u00a0 claim to\u00a0 the committee as provided by law, shall be barred from recovering such\u00a0 demand or from pleading\u00a0 the same as an\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 offset to any action,\u00a0 under the\u00a0 provisions of section\u00a0 695 of the Code of Civil Procedure, excepting: the case referred to in\u00a0 section 701 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 same; with\u00a0 still less reason\u00a0 can one\u00a0 who is not\u00a0 a creditor of the said deceased intervene in the proceedings relative to\u00a0 the latter's intestate\u00a0 estate and to the settlement of\u00a0 his succession (article 1034 of the\u00a0 Civil\u00a0 Code), because\u00a0 such creditor\u00a0 has no\u00a0 right or interest\u00a0 that call for the protection\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 law and\u00a0 the courts, except in any remainder\u00a0 which may be found\u00a0 due the heir.<br\/><br\/>It is true that\u00a0 Yap Tico, as the creditor of the widow\u00a0 and heirs of the deceased Ildefonso,\u00a0 is entitled to collect what is due\u00a0 him out of\u00a0 the property left by the latter and which was inherited by such widow and heirs, but it is no\u00a0 less true that only after\u00a0 all the debts of the said estate have been\u00a0 paid can it be\u00a0 known\u00a0 what net remainder\u00a0 will be left for division\u00a0 among the heirs,\u00a0 because the debts of\u00a0 the deceased must be paid before his heirs can.inherit.\u00a0\u00a0 (Arts. 659\u00a0 et seq.,\u00a0 1026, 1027, and 1032 of\u00a0 the Civil Code,\u00a0 and sees. 734 et seq., Code of\u00a0 Civil\u00a0 Procedure.)<br\/><br\/>An execution can not legally be\u00a0 levied\u00a0 upon the property of an\u00a0 intestate succession\u00a0 to pay the\u00a0 debts\u00a0 of the\u00a0 widow and\u00a0 heirs\u00a0 of the deceased, until the\u00a0 credits\u00a0 held\u00a0 against the latter\u00a0 at the time of\u00a0 his death shall have been paid, and\u00a0 only after the debts of the estate have been paid\u00a0 can the remaining property that pertains to the said\u00a0 debtor heirs be attached.\u00a0\u00a0 (Art.\u00a0 1034, aforecited, Civil\u00a0 Code.)<br\/><br\/>From\u00a0 the record\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 proceedings beforementioned it is\u00a0 not found that the attached one-half of the pier forms a\u00a0 part of the property remaining after payment of\u00a0 the debts against the said\u00a0 intestate estate, nor that it continues to belong to\u00a0 the\u00a0 assets of the estate left by\u00a0 the deceased Ildefonso Villa Lim Yamco;\u00a0 on\u00a0 the\u00a0 contrary, it\u00a0 appears from the said proceedings that\u00a0 the\u00a0 said one-half of\u00a0 the pier\u00a0 was transferred\u00a0 to Pablo Ortiga, the owner of\u00a0 the other half and\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiffs' predecessor in interest, in partial payment\u00a0 of a\u00a0 larger sum\u00a0 which the deceased Ildefonso Villa owed\u00a0 Ortiga, as specified by the debtor's widow, the\u00a0 administratrix of his intestate estate, on\u00a0 August\u00a0 17, 1907,\u00a0 as\u00a0 may\u00a0 be seen by the writ issued on\u00a0 May\u00a0 14 by order\u00a0 of the Hon. Judge W. F. Norris, p. 104\u00a0 of the trial record, which\u00a0 does not\u00a0 show\u00a0 that\u00a0 the said transfer in partial payment was\u00a0 impugned by any of\u00a0 the interested parties or by\u00a0 other\u00a0 creditors of the\u00a0 estate; the debt of 1,885\u00a0 pesos 43\u00a0 centavos and\u00a0 6 octavos due the Ortiga firm, the\u00a0 plaintiffs' predecessor in interest,\u00a0 and secured\u00a0 by the said one-half of the pier, was recognized and admitted, with two other debts, by the committee on\u00a0 claims in its report of\u00a0 March\u00a0 30,\u00a0 1907, page 70 of the record,\u00a0 which report was approved by the said judge in his order of April 30, 1907,\u00a0 page 76\u00a0 of the record.\u00a0\u00a0 It is to be noted that the order\u00a0 of August 30,\u00a0 1906, a copy\u00a0 of which\u00a0 was exhibited under\u00a0 letter D, and which, according to the certification of the annotations of the docket, Exhibit 3, was annulled by another order\u00a0 of November 26 of the\u00a0 same year,\u00a0 relates to the sum of\u00a0 P8,081.77, another debt\u00a0 of the intestate to the Ortiga firm, admitted by the committee of appraisal in its\u00a0 previous report of June 28, 1906,\u00a0 page 36 of the trial record.<br\/><br\/>The attachment levied upon the one-half of the said pier, at the instance of\u00a0 the defendant, Yap Tico,\u00a0 is, then, evidently and unquestionably improper, not only because the said defendant is not a\u00a0 creditor of the intestate estate of the deceased Ildefonso Villa\u00a0 Lim Yamco, but also because the said\u00a0 one-half of the\u00a0 pier became\u00a0 the\u00a0 property\u00a0 of the plaintiffs, as a partial\u00a0 payment of a certain debt\u00a0 of the deceased.\u00a0\u00a0 The plaintiffs\u00a0 must be considered as the legitimate\u00a0 owners of the\u00a0 said one-half of the\u00a0 pier, so\u00a0 long as the cession or transfer of the same is\u00a0 not annulled by an express judicial decree, through the\u00a0 prosecution\u00a0 of the proper action brought on the ground of some vice or defect tending to nullify the same.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the professional fees\u00a0 which the plaintiffs stated\u00a0 they had to\u00a0 pay their attorney for the prosecution of the\u00a0 action in order to protect their rights, which fees amounted to P600, it must be borne in mind that attorneys' fees are\u00a0 not included\u00a0 within the expenses and costs of any trial or proceedings, specified as fees to be paid by the parties\u00a0 to the\u00a0 suit, pursuant to the\u00a0 provisions of\u00a0 sections 785 and\u00a0 following of the Code of Civil Procedure; and therefore the defendants\u00a0 are not\u00a0 compelled to pay the said sum to the\u00a0 plaintiffs.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons,\u00a0 it is proper, in our opinion, to\u00a0 affirm\u00a0 the judgment appealed\u00a0 from,\u00a0 as\u00a0 we hereby do, except the finding therein whereby the defendants are sentenced to pay P600\u00a0 to the\u00a0 plaintiffs,\u00a0 which finding we expressly reverse.\u00a0\u00a0 The costs\u00a0 of this\u00a0 instance shall\u00a0 be assessed against the appellants.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano,\u00a0 C.

That after\u00a0 receiving notice of the\u00a0 decision\u00a0 of the defendant herein, Alejo Anupol appealed to the Court of First Instance of the Province\u00a0 of Nueva Ecija, and for that purpose presented a bond and deposited P16\u00a0 with the said defendant herein, thus\u00a0 complying\u00a0 with the\u00a0 requirements for the perfection of an\u00a0 appeal\u00a0 from a decision of the justice of the\u00a0 peace to the Court of First Instance.<\/p><p>Upon the perfection\u00a0 of the appeal as above stated,\u00a0 it was the duty of\u00a0 the defendant herein to forward to the Court of First Instance the record in the appealed case,\u00a0 together with the P16 (section\u00a0 38, Act No. 1627) to the Court of First Instance.\u00a0 The defendant\u00a0 herein attempted\u00a0 to prove that he\u00a0 did deliver a certified copy of the record,\u00a0 together with P16to one Nazario Cando, for the purpose of having said documents\u00a0 and money delivered\u00a0 to\u00a0 the clerk of the Court of First Instance of the\u00a0 Province\u00a0 of Nueva Ecija. This fact is positively denied by Nazario\u00a0 Cando.\u00a0\u00a0 The defendant presented no receipt showing that he had delivered said documents\u00a0 and money to Nazario Cando, and makes no explanation of his failure to take from\u00a0 Nazario Cando a receipt for the\u00a0 documents and\u00a0 money.\u00a0 The\u00a0 fact is that neither the documents nor the P16 were\u00a0 ever received by the clerk of the Court of First Instance.<\/p><p>Some time after the perfection of the\u00a0 appeal,\u00a0 the said Alejo Anupol\u00a0 inquired of the clerk of the Court\u00a0 of First Instance if his\u00a0 appeal had been received\u00a0 in the\u00a0 office of the clerk, and upon being\u00a0 informed that the appeal\u00a0 had not been received,\u00a0 he put\u00a0 on foot\u00a0 an administrative investigation concerning\u00a0 the loss\u00a0 of the documents, which investigation was conducted by the Court of First Instance of said province.\u00a0 At the conclusion pf said investigation, the court ordered that the defendant be prosecuted for the crime herein charged against him.<\/p><p>Another\u00a0 very important fact which goes to show the culpability\u00a0 of\u00a0 the defendant with\u00a0 reference to\u00a0 the facts charged in\u00a0 the complaint is that\u00a0 at the close of his services as auxiliary justice of the peace he delivered to\u00a0 the clerk of the Court of First Instance of said province a list of the causes which had been pending before him as such auxiliary justice of the peace and the\u00a0 cause between Aguirre\u00a0 and Anupol\u00a0 was not included in said list.\u00a0 No explanation\u00a0 is given of this omission.<\/p><p>The Hon. Julio Llorente,\u00a0 the judge who\u00a0 tried the defendant, commenting upon the\u00a0 declaration of\u00a0 the defendant at the trial of the cause, said:<\/p><p>\"The\u00a0 accused\u00a0 testified falsely,\u00a0 and\u00a0 we are\u00a0 convinced that he effected the disappearance of the\u00a0 cause prosecuted against Alejo\u00a0 Anupol in order to make it appear that he had forwarded it to the court with the P16.\"<\/p><p>The attorney for the defendant in this court attempts to show that\u00a0 the evidence adduced during\u00a0 the\u00a0 trial of the cause demonstrates that\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant is guilty\u00a0 of the crime of estafa and not of the crime charged in said complaint.<\/p><p>Groizard,\u00a0 in\u00a0 his\u00a0 valuable Commentaries on the\u00a0 Penal Code, with special reference to article 360, in speaking of the essentials of the crime of\u00a0 faithlessness in the custody of documents says:<\/p><p>\"Four circumstances are required to establish the crime: (1) that the agent be a public officer; (2) that he abstract, destroy\u00a0 or conceal\u00a0 documents;\u00a0 (3) that\u00a0 the documents which he abstracts, destroys or conceals be entrusted to him by reason of his office; and\u00a0 (4) that injury to a third party or to\u00a0 the\u00a0 public follow\u00a0 from the abstraction, destruction or concealment.\u00a0\u00a0 If any of these circumstances be not present,\u00a0\u00a0 the crime\u00a0 disappears, or\u00a0 rather,\u00a0\u00a0 does\u00a0 not\u00a0 arise.? (Groizard, Penal Code of 1870, Vol. IV, p. 146,\u00a0 edition of 1891.)<\/p><p>Viada, in discussing the\u00a0 provisions of the same article of the Penal\u00a0 Code, says:<\/p><p>\"Remember that for the existence of the crime\u00a0 herein specified it is an <em>essential <\/em>condition\u00a0 that\u00a0 the papers\u00a0 or documents, whose abstraction,\u00a0 destruction or concealment is in question, should have been entrusted to a public officer <em>by reason\u00a0 of his\u00a0 office:<\/em> otherwise,\u00a0 the\u00a0 abstraction would be converted into the\u00a0 act\u00a0 of a mere private person, and would not\u00a0 be punishable under\u00a0 this article but\u00a0 under number 9 of 548, which applies to those who commit fraud by abstracting, concealing, or\u00a0 rendering useless in\u00a0 whole or in part some cause, record,\u00a0 document or other paper of that kind.\"\u00a0 (Viada,\u00a0 vol 2, p. 563, edition of 1890.) It\u00a0 seems clear from all the facts that the defendant\u00a0 is guilty of the crime charged in the complaint and not of the crime of estafa.<\/p><p>It will be noted\u00a0 that the\u00a0 punishment provided for under article 360 includes imprisonment <em>and<\/em> a <em>fine. <\/em>The lower court\u00a0 failed\u00a0 to\u00a0 impose the fine.\u00a0 Under all\u00a0 the circumstances surrounding the commission of the crime charged, as demonstrated by the evidence\u00a0 adduced during the trial of the cause, we are of the opinion that the sentence of the lower court should be affirmed and that in addition thereto a fine should be imposed upon the defendant in the sum of 1,000 pesetas.\u00a0 With this\u00a0 modification, the sentence of the lower court is hereby affirmed.\u00a0 It is so ordered.<\/p><p><em>Torres, Mapa,\u00a0 Carson,<\/em> and <em>Moreland, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<\/p><\/div>",

after such period, I shall have no further right to said rents and Senor Florendo may then begin to collect them.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>This contract was signed by the party who executed it, by his wife and two witnesses, and was, by the first mentioned, ratified\u00a0 before a notary.<\/p><p>Eustaquio\u00a0 Foz went to\u00a0 Vigan,\u00a0 and on\u00a0 June 23 of the same year, Jose Florendo,\u00a0 accompanied by a\u00a0 notary, tendered to the former the P4,000, the rest of the price of the sale; but Foz refused to receive them, saying that the true price of the sale, recorded in\u00a0 another instrument\u00a0 held by Florendo, was P10,000, and that on the second or third day after the\u00a0 first\u00a0 instrument had\u00a0 been executed,\u00a0 Florendo, while still\u00a0 in Manila, repudiated the contract.\u00a0 These facts were recorded by the notary in a notarial certificate.\u00a0\u00a0 (Exhibit C,\u00a0 of the plaintiff.)<\/p><p>For the foregoing reasons, Florendo instituted the present suit against Foz, wherein\u00a0 he asked\u00a0 that the\u00a0 defendant be sentenced:\u00a0 (<em>a<\/em>) To comply with the contract of absolute purchase and\u00a0 sale,\u00a0 by delivering to\u00a0 the plaintiff the property sold; (<em>b<\/em>)\u00a0 to pay to the plaintiff the rents of the entire realty\u00a0 from July 1, 1909, until the judgment should be fulfilled, together with the legal interest on the amount of such rents, and that the court fix the sum which the defendant\u00a0 must pay for his\u00a0 use\u00a0 of a\u00a0 part of the property; (<em>c<\/em>)\u00a0 that, out of the P4,000 deposited by the plaintiff in the municipal treasury of Vigan, Ilocos Sur, payment be made to the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church, in the said pueblo of Vigan, \"Obispado de Nueva Segovia,\" of the mortgage credit due that it\u00a0 holds\u00a0 against the defendant, and that the\u00a0 remainder left after paying all the debts found to be owing by the judgment to be rendered, be delivered, to the said\u00a0 defendant; and, (<em>d<\/em>) to pay the costs of the trial.<\/p><p>The\u00a0 defendant, in his answer to the complaint, alleged that it\u00a0 was false that he\u00a0 had sold his property for\u00a0 the price of P6,000; that, if he signed the deed of sale, he was deceived in so doing,\u00a0 as he had heard,\u00a0 or believed\u00a0 that he had heard,\u00a0 when it was previously read\u00a0 to him,\u00a0 that the amount stated therein was P10,000, which was the true sum agreed upon between\u00a0 himself and the plaintiff as the price of the property.\u00a0 The defendant therefore asked that the deed of sale be declared to\u00a0 be false, null and void, and, in counter-complaint, prayed that the plaintiff be compelled to return to him the ownership title of the property, which was in the\u00a0 plaintiff's possession.<\/p><p>The Court of First Instance\u00a0 of Ilocos Sur, after hearing the evidence adduced by both sides, rendered judgment in conformity with the plaintiff's petition, except with regard to fixing the amount which the defendant should pay as rent for the personal use of a part of the house, and disallowed the defendant's counter-complaint.<\/p><p>The latter appealed from that judgment, and the hearing on the appeal discloses the following facts:\u00a0 <\/p><ol><li>That the evidence presented by\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant was rather intended to prove that the year before he had been offered the price of P8,000 for his property and that\u00a0 the latter\u00a0 was worth\u00a0 more than P6,000, in rebuttal of which the plaintiff showed the price for which the property had been acquired and its\u00a0 assessed valuation, neither of which exceeded\u00a0 P6,000.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/><\/li>\u00a0 <li>That, as regards\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant's special\u00a0 defense to the effect that the deed of sale was read to\u00a0 him before he signed it and that he heard or believed that he heard that the price\u00a0 stipulated in the deed\u00a0 was P10,000, not only was no evidence whatever presented, but also no offer\u00a0 nor attempt was made to introduce any.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/><\/li>\u00a0 <li> That the court ordered the deposit of the P4,000, as the remainder of the payment of the price and which in the complaint was said to\u00a0 be deposited in the municipal treasury of Vigan, to be made in the provincial treasury, from which\u00a0 ruling the defendant took an exception, alleging that it was\u00a0 another\u00a0 defense of\u00a0 his,\u00a0 in support of his refusal to deliver the property sold, that the rest of the price thereof had not been properly\u00a0 deposited, either in May or in June, 1909.<br\/><\/li>\u00a0 <li>That the defendant ratified at the trial\u00a0 his answer in the notarial certificate\u00a0 of June 23,\u00a0 1909 (Exhibit C of\u00a0 the plaintiff),\u00a0 that\u00a0 is, his\u00a0 averment that another instrument had been executed in which the\u00a0 true price of P10,000 was stipulated; but this averment was not repeated nor proved during the whole trial.<br\/><\/li>\u00a0 <li>That in the appellant's brief in this instance, on page 14 thereof, the following statements appear:<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 \"The plaintiff, on his reading this instrument to the\u00a0 defendant, made the latter believe that the amount stipulated therein as the price of the contract was P10,000, and in this belief the defendant signed that notarial document.\u00a0 That fact having been proved by the defendant's testimony, which was neither contradicted nor rebutted, is that document to prevail over all the proofs adduced?\"<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 None of these statements can be accepted as correct.\u00a0\u00a0 It was not proved, nor was\u00a0 it attempted to\u00a0 be proved, that the instrument, before being signed by the appellant, was read to him by another person; nor that such other person was the appellee himself; nor\u00a0 that any person read one thing\u00a0 for another, as being\u00a0 what\u00a0 was stipulated\u00a0 in the instrument.\u00a0 For these reasons it was\u00a0 the conclusion of the trial court that neither the deceit alleged by the defendant to have been employed by the plaintiff in the execution\u00a0 of the\u00a0 contract, nor\u00a0 the falsity\u00a0 of the instrument executed, was proved.\u00a0 (B. of eM p. 12.)\u00a0 <\/li><\/ol><p>Consequently, the instrument of contract is valid and effective.\u00a0 From the validity and force\u00a0 of the\u00a0 contract\u00a0 is derived the obligation on\u00a0 the part of the vendor to deliver the thing sold.<\/p><p>Pursuant to article 1466 of the Civil Code, the vendor shall not\u00a0 be bound to deliver the thing sold, if\u00a0 the vendee should not have paid the price, or if a period for the payment has not been\u00a0 fixed in the contract.\u00a0 If\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 contract a period has\u00a0 been fixed for the payment, the vendor must deliver the thing sold.\u00a0 In the contract in question, a period was\u00a0 fixed\u00a0 for the payment:<\/p><p>The said party (the vendee) - says the vendor - shall pay me the remaining four thousand in Vigan when I go there at any time during this month or next month.\u00a0\u00a0 In\u00a0 case of my being unable to go to\u00a0 Vigan,\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 the .said Florendo shall\u00a0 send the remainder\u00a0 (after\u00a0 paying the vendor's debt to the Church of Vigan) to me here in Manila.<\/p><p>In accordance with the first of the\u00a0 said quoted clauses, the period for payment is when the vendor shall have arrived at Vigan; and\u00a0 if he does not arrive at Vigan, such period is, according to the second clause,\u00a0 indefinite,\u00a0 the\u00a0 vendee merely taking it upon himself to send the rest to Manila, after the month of June, 1909, should the vendor not arrive at Vigan.<\/p><p>The provisions of the said article 1466, contain a rule and an exception: the rule is that the thing shall not be delivered, unless the price be paid; and\u00a0 the exception is that\u00a0 the thing must be delivered, though the price be not first paid, if a time for such payment has been fixed in the contract. Hence, all the discussion between the contending parties, with respect to\u00a0 whether the deposit of the P4,000, a part of the price, was or was not made, or was duly or unduly made, is entirely impertinent: the conveyance of the thing sold does not depend on the payment of the price, in this case of exception contained in article\u00a0 1466 of the Civil Code.<\/p><blockquote><p>\"If\u00a0 this\u00a0 period was\u00a0 fixed, the vendor, notwithstanding that such period has not terminated, nor, consequently, that he has not collected the price, is obliged to deliver\u00a0 the thing sold.\"\u00a0 (10 Manresa, Commentaries on the Civil Code, 130.)<\/p><\/blockquote><p>There was no need, therefore, of assent on the part of the plaintiff to\u00a0 pay the P4,000, the remainder of the price, in order to oblige the defendant unconditionally to deliver the property sold.\u00a0 With still more reason should the defendant be compelled to effect the material delivery of the property, since, after the lapse of the\u00a0 period for the delivery of the price, the plaintiff hastened to pay it and, on account of the defendant's refusal to receive it, duly deposited\u00a0 it, in order to avoid the consequences that might issue from delinquency in the payment\u00a0 of a sum entrusted to him for a fixed period.<\/p><p>It is the <em>material<\/em> delivery of\u00a0 the property\u00a0 sold which the defendant must make in\u00a0 compliance with the\u00a0 contract, inasmuch as the formal delivery de jure was made, according to the provisions of article 1462, 2d paragraph, of the same code:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"When the\u00a0 sale should be made by means of\u00a0 a public instrument, the execution thereof shall be equivalent to the delivery of\u00a0 the thing which\u00a0 is the object of the\u00a0 contract, if in said instrument the contrary does not appear or may be clearly inferred.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>As the contrary does not appear nor is to\u00a0 be inferred from the public instrument executed by the defendant, its execution was really a formal or symbolical delivery of the property sold and authorized the plaintiff to\u00a0 use the title of\u00a0 ownership as proof that he was\u00a0 thenceforth the owner of\u00a0 the\u00a0 property.<\/p><p>The judgment appealed from is affirmed in all its parts, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.<\/p><p><em>Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson, Moreland<\/em>, and <em>Trent, JJ.<\/em>, concur.<\/p><\/div>",

In spite\u00a0 of the defendant's opposition, the court, ruling on this incidental question raised, issued the aforecited order of October\u00a0 18, 1910.<\/p><p>Counsel for the administrator\u00a0 Pena did not file a brief calculated to prove the soundness\u00a0 of his appeal from\u00a0 the order of\u00a0 October 14, 1910, whereby there was declared a set-off\u00a0 between the amounts for which the plaintiff and the defendant were liable, up to the\u00a0 sum where the liability of the one equaled that of the other, the latter to pay to the former the difference, together with the interest.\u00a0\u00a0 This order is pursuant to the law and in perfect harmony with the decision rendered in the\u00a0 case by this court, and,\u00a0 though\u00a0 it was not\u00a0 duly impugned,\u00a0 its legality\u00a0 and\u00a0 correctness will be considered in this decision in demonstrating that of the other order of the 18th of the same month, appealed from by the intervening attorneys and by the\u00a0 counsel\u00a0 for Federico Hidalgo.<\/p><p>With respect to the said order of the 18th of October, the second of those appealed from in this incidental issue,\u00a0 it must be borne in mind, for the proper determination of the pending appeals, that the main action, from which the said incidental issue proceeded, was prosecuted\u00a0 in the Court of First Instance of this city by Jose de la Pena y de Ramon, in his capacity as judicial administrator of\u00a0 the estate of his deceased\u00a0 father, Jose de la Pena y Gomte, against Federico Hidalgo,\u00a0 for the payment of various sums which\u00a0 the latter was owing, with interest, to the estate; and\u00a0 that the defendant, in answering the complaint filed by\u00a0 the said administrator, presented a counterclaim\u00a0 and,\u00a0 in turn, asked that he be absolved from the complaint with the costs against the plaintiff and that the latter be sentenced to the payment of P9,000 which the testator, Jose de la Pena y Gomiz, owed to Hidalgo.\u00a0 So that if the complaint in the\u00a0 main action was filed by the administrator of the estate of the deceased Pena y Gomiz, the counterclaim presented in the same suit by the defendant,\u00a0 Federico Hidalgo, in\u00a0 answering the complaint of the administrator\u00a0 of\u00a0 the estate, had for its\u00a0 object the collection of a certain sum with interest, which the deceased testator,\u00a0 during his lifetime, owed the said defendant.<\/p><p>The defendant may, pursuant to section 95 of the Code of Procedure in\u00a0 Civil Actions, set forth by answer as many defenses\u00a0 and counterclaims as he may have, whatever their nature.\u00a0\u00a0 Section 96 of the same code provides that a counterclaim, to be available as a defense in an answer, must be one in favor of all the substantial defendants and against all the substantial plaintiffs in the action.<\/p><p>A counterclaim is\u00a0 termed a mutual\u00a0 petition,\u00a0 because both parties sue each other mutually in the same action, each of them assuming\" the double\u00a0 role of plaintiff and defendant, before the trial judge, and the two suits are brought under a single proceeding where both actions are\u00a0 tried at the same time and finally determined in one and the same judgment<\/p><p>The different amounts sought to be recovered by Jose de la Pena y de Ramon, as the administrator of the estate of the deceased Jose de la Pena y Gomiz, from the defendant,\u00a0 Federico Hidalgo, constitute various separate obligations contracted by the latter, according to the complaint, in favor of the deceased testator, Pena y Gomiz; and the amount of the counterclaim was likewise a debt which the said testator at his\u00a0 death left unpaid and owing the defendant Hidalgo; therefore, Jose de la Pena y de Ramon, as administrator, and Federico Hidalgo\u00a0 are\u00a0 the substantial\u00a0 plaintiffs and defendants, reciprocally, in the aforementioned main action.<\/p><p>It is evident, by a simple perusal of the finding of facts and of the grounds of law of the final decision rendered in that action, that the same was instituted by Jose de la Pena y de Ramon, not by himself and in\u00a0 his own representation,\u00a0 but in his capacity as administrator of the estate of his deceased father, Jose de\u00a0 la Pena y Gomiz,\u00a0 demanding payment of certain amounts which, according to his third amended complaint, the defendant Federico Hidalgo owed the latter; and it is none the less\u00a0 evident\u00a0 that the counterclaim presented by the defendant Federico Hidalgo had for its sole object the collection of a certain sum which was owing to him by the deceased testator, Jose de la Pena y Gomiz, and that the plaintiff, Jose de la Pena y de Ramon, <em>per se<\/em> and personally, had nothing to do with this debt of the estate, which concerned him only as such administrator.\u00a0 This is shown by the record and clearly appears in the said decision which disposed\u00a0 of\u00a0 the plaintiff-administrator's complaint and the defendant-debtor's counterclaim. That\u00a0 decision, from the beginning\u00a0 to the\u00a0 end, evidences without contradiction or proof to the contrary, all that has been hereinbefore stated; it shows who were the contending parties, the nature of the questions raised by complaint and counterclaim\u00a0 and the respective\u00a0 purposes sought by the one and the other; it is therefore unreasonable to affirm that the counterclaim was made against Pena y de\u00a0 Ramon personally, apart from his position as administrator.<\/p><p>If in any place or in any line of the said decision mention was made\u00a0 of the\u00a0 name of the plaintiff Pena\u00a0 y de Ramon without the title of his office as administrator of the estate, it probably was because\u00a0 the complaint was filed\u00a0 and the action was brought by him in his capacity of administrator, and the counterclaim, also, was directed against him as such administrator;\u00a0 and if in any paragraph the said title of his office was omitted in designating him, such omission can not serve\u00a0 as a ground for concluding\u00a0 that the\u00a0 counterclaim allowed and the sentence imposed in the said decision were against Jose de la Pena y de Ramon as a private individual and not as the administrator of the estate, for the reason that the said Pena y de Ramon is not by himself and in his own name a party to the said action, but is such only in his capacity of administrator of the aforementioned estate; and the sentence contained in the decision referred to can in no wise be\u00a0 understood to have been made against Jose de la Pena y de Ram6n personally, but in his capacity of administrator of the\u00a0 estate, which\u00a0 alone\u00a0 was liable\u00a0 for the debt owing to the defendant; if mention was therein made of the plaintiff by name, it is because he was the representative of the debtor estate.<\/p><p>The intervening attorneys allege\u00a0 that,\u00a0 in the aforesaid suit between the administrator Pena y de Ramon\u00a0 and Hidalgo,\u00a0 two judgments were rendered,\u00a0 one against the defendant\u00a0 Hidalgo and the other against the administrator Pena y de Ramon.\u00a0 This averment is incorrect, because, as has been seen and is obvious to all who intervened in the said suit, there was but one judgment appealed from and but one decision rendered in second instance by this court, which in part modified the prior judgment in first instance.\u00a0 A complaint and a counterclaim having been entered in the said suit, it logically follows that the decision should contain a finding relative to the demand contained in the\u00a0 complaint and another finding concerning the counterclaim.\u00a0 This separation of findings\u00a0 in one decision does hot denote distinct judgments, but different disposals of the several questions raised in the suit and comprised within a\u00a0 single decision, which alone terminated the double litigation.\u00a0 Reason and justice will not support the claim that the sentence therein contained, directing Jose de la Pena y de Ramon to pay to the defendant Hidalgo the sum of P9,000 and interest by virtue of the counterclaim, was pronounced\u00a0 against the plaintiff in his personal capacity\u00a0 and not as\u00a0 administrator of the estate, inasmuch as Pena y de Ramon did\u00a0 not initiate or prosecute his suit, in the\u00a0 said main action on his own account, but in his capacity as administrator; and the debt demanded in the counterclaim was one owing by the estate, which he represented in that action, and by his father, the testator\u00a0 Pena y Gomiz, as the judge of First Instance, in directing in his order of October 14, 1910, in fulfillment and execution of\u00a0 the decision\u00a0 of this court, so recognized such debt and declared in an unmistakable manner that Hidalgo was entitled, as\u00a0 a\u00a0 result of the set-off between the\u00a0 two amounts specified in the decision of the Supreme Court and which the administrator\u00a0 Pena y de Ramon and\u00a0 the defendant Hidalgo were mutually owing to each other, to collect the sum of P2,274.93\u00a0 with interest thereon at the rate of 6 per cent per annum,\u00a0 this amount being the\u00a0 difference between\u00a0 the two debts set off against each other and which is owing to the defendant from the estate.<\/p><p>In the aforementioned decision of this court, by\u00a0 which the complaint and the counterclaim presented by the\u00a0 parties to the said suit were disposed of, the amount which the defendant Hidalgo should pay to the administrator\u00a0 of the estate of the deceased Pena y Gomiz and the\u00a0 sum which the said administrator,\u00a0 designated by his\u00a0 name of Jose de la Pena y de Ramon, should, by virtue of the counterclaim, pay to the defendant, Federico Hidalgo, alone were\u00a0 specified; the resultant difference, after the set-off should have been made, was not stated, as it was considered that this merely arithmetical operation\u00a0 would necessarily be\u00a0 performed in the course of the execution proceedings by the judge of the Court of First Instance\u00a0 charged\u00a0 with carrying out the final\u00a0 decision rendered in the case.\u00a0 This, in fact, he did do in his order of October 14, by directing that the plaintiff should pay the said sum, that is, the difference which was found to exist, after making the set-off between the respective amounts the litigating parties were sentenced to pay. The failure to state in the said decision that both debts\u00a0 were set off against each other up to a concurrent sum, can not avail as a ground for alleging that the attorneys of the administrator Pena y de\u00a0 Ramon have acquired a\u00a0 lien on the amount which Hidalgo should pay to the administrator\u00a0 Pena y de Ram6n in preference to the creditor of the amount that is the subject of the\u00a0 counterclaim.<\/p><p>It is to be observed that, although counsel for the plaintiff Pena excepted to the order of October 14, 1910, by which the judge of the Court of First Instance, following the final decision of this court, declared a set-off between the amounts that were owing reciprocally\u00a0 by both parties and\u00a0 directed the said plaintiff to pay to the defendant the difference of P2,274.93 with interest\u00a0 at the rate of 6 per cent per annum, he did not present any bill of exceptions nor any brief\u00a0 with the required assignment of errors, doubtless because he was convinced that the appeal which he would have to maintain was directed against\u00a0 a final decision of this court.<\/p><p>It is lawful and proper\u00a0 to allow\u00a0 the\u00a0 set-off between the two amounts specified in the said\u00a0 decision,\u00a0 in\u00a0 accordance with the provisions of articles\u00a0 1195, 1196,\u00a0 and 1202 of the Civil\u00a0 Code,\u00a0 because the credit\u00a0 of P6,774.50,\u00a0 together\u00a0 with the legal interest thereon, to the payment of which the defendant Hidalgo was\u00a0 sentenced, belongs to the estate of the deceased Pena y Gomiz, represented by the plaintiff, Pena y de Ramon, and the P9,000, with interest, which,\u00a0 in turn, the plaintiff-administrator was sentenced to pay\u00a0 to the said defendant, was a debt of the testator which it is now incumbent upon his estate to repay to his creditor; therefore, as the trial judge very well says in the order of October 18, appealed from, the lien of the intervening attorneys can not serve to prevent the set-off, for the reason that such interveners rendered their services to Jose de la Pena y de Ramon as administrator of the said estate, and the credit by which the debt owing to this estate by the defendant Hidalgo appears to be set off consists of a debt of the estate in favor of its debtor, Hidalgo.<\/p><p>If it be just that the estate of the deceased Pena y Gomiz should collect the amount owing it by'Hidalgo, as determined by final decision, it\u00a0 is equally just that Hidalgo should have the same right to collect the sum which the said estate owes him, according to the same decision; therefore, in order to comply with such decision, determining the two liabilities directly opposed to each other, it\u00a0 consequently and logically follows that a set-off\u00a0 of both credits, up\u00a0 to a concurrent amount,\u00a0 must be effected; and if the lien or the right to collect professional\u00a0 fees on the part of the attorneys were superior to the right of the creditor of the estate, the result would be that the executory decision would not be complied with; there would then be no set-off and the defendant would be compelled to pay to the said administrator his debt to the estate, through the aforementioned lien\u00a0 of the intervening attorneys, but could not collect, nor apply to the\u00a0 payment of the credit owing him by the same\u00a0 estate, the amount of his debt to the latter; this would be illegal and opposed to the most rudimentary principles of\u00a0 justice and,\u00a0 furthermore, would be an absurdity and contrary to common sense.<\/p><p>Section 37 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions prescribes, among other provisions, that\u00a0 a lawyer shall have a lien upon all\u00a0 judgments and decrees for\u00a0 the payment of money, and executions issued in pursuance of such judgments and decrees which he has secured in a litigation of his client, from and after, but not before, the time when he shall have caused to\u00a0 be\u00a0 entered upon\u00a0 the\u00a0 records of the court, *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 and shall have the same right\u00a0 and power\u00a0 over such judgments, decrees and executions to enforce his lien as his client had or may have, to the extent that may be necessary for the payment\u00a0 of his just fees\u00a0 and disbursements.<\/p><p>If it be taken into account that, while the\u00a0 administrator Pena y de Ramon is\u00a0 entitled\u00a0 to collect from Hidalgo the P6,774.50 which the latter is owing to the\u00a0 estate left by the said Pena's father, this estate must, in turn, pay to the said Hidalgo P9,000; and that, on comparing these two amounts with each other, in proceeding with the execution of the final judgment, it would necessarily be disclosed by the operation that the said estate or\u00a0 its administrator, far from collecting any\u00a0 sum whatever from its or his credit, would have\u00a0 to pay Hidalgo the difference resulting from the set-off between the one amount and the other, up to a concurrent sum, it will\u00a0 be understood at once that the attorneys for the\u00a0 representative of that estate can\u00a0 not\u00a0 collect any part whatever of the amount awarded in the executory decision, because that sum was\u00a0 intended to cover a large part of the debt of the testator and the latter's testate succession\u00a0 will still have to pay the difference.<\/p><p>The lien or\u00a0 right to collect fees for professional service, which\u00a0 the appellant attorneys possess to the\u00a0 sum awarded in the\u00a0 final decision, is equal to the right of their client, to that of the administrator Pena y de\u00a0 Ramon,\u00a0 recognized in the said decision, pursuant to the provisions of the aforecited section 37 of the Code of Civil\u00a0 Procedure.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 preference claimed by these interveners over the creditor's right, by virtue of the latter's counterclaim, does not appear to be established by this section; and if\u00a0 the estate of the deceased Pena is obliged to pay to Hidalgo P9,OOO,\u00a0 it is not entitled to collect from the latter the said\u00a0 P6,774.50 by way of a set-off, unless it shall previously have satisfied the whole amount of its debt, which it has not done; therefore the attorneys of the representative of the said estate are not entitled\u00a0 to collect their fees out of the said amount recognized by decision to belong to their client, but subject\u00a0 to a\u00a0 set-off by\u00a0 virtue of a counterclaim, as their rights are no better than those of the creditor Hidalgo.<\/p><p>The judgment appealed from having been reversed with respect to that portion thereof relative to the liability asked by the administrator of the estate to be laid against Federico Hidalgo, the sole judgment to be executed is that contained in the decision rendered in second instance and in this decision, as has been shown; and the result, in short, has been in no wise favorable to the plaintiff because, instead of being able to collect the amount of his credit owing by Hidalgo to the estate, he still finds himself obliged to pay the defendant the difference resulting from the set-off to\u00a0 which the counter-claim, made by the latter for a greater sum, gave rise; and therefore, the right claimed by the appellant attorneys\u00a0 to collect their fees\u00a0 out of the amount awarded to the\u00a0 said administrator, is in\u00a0 all respects unsustainable, inasmuch as, in consequence of the\u00a0 counterclaim, there\u00a0 was a\u00a0 set-off against that amount and the plaintiff has nothing to collect, but, on the contrary, is still\u00a0 liable for the difference which was found to exist after the reciprocal debts of both parties had been set off against each other.<\/p><p>The right of the attorneys\u00a0 for the administrator Pena y\u00a0 de Ramon, to collect fees for professional service, under section\u00a0 37 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 Code of Civil Procedure, is restricted to the personal funds of their client, to amounts awarded to the latter by final decision, but does not comprise sums of money which, according to the same decision, must\u00a0 be applied\u00a0 to the payment of a legitimate debt\u00a0 of their client ordered to be made in such decision by virtue\u00a0 of a prior counterclaim.<\/p><p>We know of no\u00a0 legal\u00a0 provision which\u00a0 grants\u00a0 to the attorneys for the losing party in a suit, or who has not obtained a judgment authorizing him to\u00a0 collect money from the adverse party, the privilege of\u00a0 collecting their professional fees with preference over, and better right than, the said adverse party,\u00a0 the legitimate creditor of the said attorneys' client.<\/p><p>The suit was prosecuted for the collection of amounts which both parties reciprocally were owing each other, and a\u00a0 decision\u00a0 was rendered\u00a0 deciding the complaint and the counterclaim and determining the sums which the\u00a0 litigate ing parties must mutually pay; therefore, the final judgment must be\u00a0 executed, as\u00a0 provided by\u00a0 the trial\u00a0 judge, pursuant to its terms, and no impediment to such execution can be had in the improper contention made\u00a0 by the appellant attorneys, who can invoke no law or just\u00a0 reason which authorizes\u00a0 them to collect their prpfessional fees\u00a0 out of the bond given by Hidalgo, once the same was\u00a0 not deposited as security for the payment of the said fees.<\/p><p>For the foregoing reasons,\u00a0 whereby the errors attributed by the appellant attorneys to\u00a0 the trial judge have been duly refuted, it is our opinion and we hold that we should and hereby do\u00a0 affirm the order of October 14, 1910, and also the order of the 18th of the same month,\u00a0 with the\u00a0 exception of the final provision of\u00a0 this last order, of October 18, which we reverse and direct\u00a0 that return be made to Federico Hidalgo of the sum of P8,500 retained by the clerk of the court below as a result of the motion of intervention herein concerned.\u00a0 No special\u00a0 finding is made as\u00a0 to the costs.\u00a0 So\u00a0 ordered.<\/p><p><em>Mapa, Johnson<\/em>, and <em>Moreland, JJ.<\/em>, concur.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><hr align=\"left\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><p><\/p><sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> 16 Phil.

S.\u00a0 Army, was stationed and in command of troops at the barrio of Isabela,\u00a0 municipality of Zamboanga, Moro\u00a0 Province,\u00a0 and at the\u00a0 same time acting councilman for said barrio.\u00a0 On the 9th of that month Captain Dworak received from the wife of one Doroteo Saavedra a verbal complaint that she had been\u00a0 illtreated by her husband.\u00a0 Thereupon the captain ordered Saavedra to appear before him.\u00a0\u00a0 Saavedra declined to obey this order.\u00a0 Captain Dworak\u00a0 then\u00a0 proceeded\u00a0 to\u00a0 Saavedra's house,\u00a0 placed him under arrest, and took him to the captain's office where an investigation was made\u00a0 which was followed by an\u00a0 order given by the captain directing Saavedra to be confined in the local jail or guardhouse for the period\u00a0 of fifteen days and to pay a fine of P15. This order was carried into effect by the troops under the captain's command.\u00a0 After Saavedra had served the fifteen\u00a0 days' confinement and\u00a0 paid the fine he\u00a0 was\u00a0 released.\u00a0 Subsequently thereto and on the 3d of August of the same year the said Saavedra filed in the Court of First Instance of the Moro Province a criminal complaint against\u00a0 Captain Dworak, charging him with the crime of illegal detention.\u00a0\u00a0 A preliminary examination followed and the Hon.\u00a0 Herbert\u00a0 D.\u00a0 Gale, then\u00a0 judge of the Fourteenth Judicial District, issued on the 16th of December, 1910, an order holding the defendant, Dworak, in the sum of P3,000 to appear before the Court of First Instance to answer said charge.\u00a0 In the same order, and upon his own motion, Judge Gale disqualified Connor,\u00a0 the\u00a0 provincial attorney, and Captain Ansell, assistant provincial attorney, from conducting the\u00a0 prosecution against\u00a0 Dworak,\u00a0 and\u00a0 appointed\u00a0 Nicolas Nunez, a member of the\u00a0 Zamboanga bar and petitioner in the\u00a0 case under\u00a0 consideration, special prosecuting attorney to represent the Government\u00a0 in said criminal case.\u00a0 On or about January 1, 1911, Judge Gale was relieved from duty as judge of the Fourteenth District and appointed judge at large, and Judge Low was\u00a0 transferred to the Fourteenth District.\u00a0 the prosecuting attorney presented\u00a0 on the\u00a0 27th of December, 1910, a motion asking the court to annul that part of the order of December 16th which disqualified him and\u00a0 his assistant from conducting\u00a0 the prosecution against Dworak.\u00a0 This motion was heard by the respondent judge, who, by order dated January 20,\u00a0 1911, amended\u00a0 and\u00a0 set aside that part of the order of December 16, 1910,\u00a0 disqualifying Connor and his assistant, and directed them to proceed with the case according to law.<br\/><br\/>As to whether or not the\u00a0 Court of First Instance was justified under the\u00a0 facts then before it in issuing the two orders (dated December 16, 1910, and January 20, 1911), we can\u00a0 not and do\u00a0 not now determine.\u00a0\u00a0 The only question before us at this time\u00a0 is one of law; that is, did the court exceed its jurisdiction in issuing the annulling order?\u00a0 The determination of this question necessarily involves\u00a0 the\u00a0 validity of the order of December 16.\u00a0 This order was based upon the provisions of section\u00a0 11 of Act No. 83, as amended by section 1 of Act No. 223, section 1 of Act No. 1443, and section 1 of Act No. 1699, which section, as thus amended, provides:<br\/><blockquote><center><br\/>*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><\/center> <br\/>\"Whenever the provincial fiscal is absent from the province, or fails or refuses to e his duty by reason of illness\u00a0 or other cause, or by reason of personal interest in a prosecution or other matter is disqualified to act therein as provincial fiscal, the judge of the Court of First Instance for\u00a0 the province is\u00a0 authorized and\u00a0 required to appoint a temporary fiscal, who shall be paid out of the provincial <br\/>treasury the same compensation per day as that\u00a0 provided by law for the regular provincial fiscal for the days actually employed.\u00a0 The fiscal thus temporarily appointed shall discharge all the duties of the provincial fiscal as provided by law which the regular provincial fiscal\u00a0 fails or is unable to perform.\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\"<\/blockquote>Judge Low was of the opinion\u00a0 that the above provisions of law\u00a0 are not applicable to the Moro Province and that the court was without authority to suspend the attorney and assistant attorney for that province and appoint a temporary fiscal to represent the Government in that criminal\u00a0 case. In passing upon these questions he said:<br\/><blockquote>'\"The court is of the opinion that Act No. 83 does not apply to the Moro Province, which was established under Act No. 787\u00a0 and which act fully provides how the said Moro Province shall be governed.\u00a0\u00a0 The entire scheme of\u00a0 government for this\u00a0 province is different from that provided by Act No. 83 for provinces in general.\u00a0 Nowhere in said Act establishing the Moro Province can a provision be found similar to section 11 of Act No. 83, as amended by Act No. 223, conferring on the judge\u00a0 of the Court of First Instance for the province authority to suspend\u00a0 the attorney of the province or the assistant attorney,\u00a0 and 'to appoint a, temporary provincial fiscal,' etc.\u00a0 Moreover there\u00a0 is no such officer in the Moro Province as the provincial fiscal.\u00a0\u00a0 There is an attorney and an assistant attorney for the\u00a0 Moro Province.\u00a0\u00a0 The assistant attorneys are empowered to act as district fiscals under the supervision of the attorney for the Moro Province.\u00a0 There is no\u00a0 such officer as the 'provincial fiscal,' referred to in Act No. 83.\u00a0\u00a0 The powers and duties of the. attorney\u00a0 and his assistants\u00a0 are fully set forth in the Act and it not appearing that the judge of this court have the power or authority conferred on him by law to suspend either of the above-named officers or to appoint a special fiscal to act in these places, that portion of the\u00a0 order is\u00a0 hereby set aside and amended and the information herein signed by Sr. Nicolas Nunez, as special fiscal, ordered stricken from the files, and the attorney for the Moro Province,\u00a0 and his assistants, are directed to proceed in this case according\u00a0 to law.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It will be noted,\u00a0 that the respondent\u00a0 held that the Court of First Instance of the Moro Province is without authority to appoint, under any circumstances, a temporary prosecuting officer\u00a0 to represent the Government in any criminal cause.\u00a0 In this we\u00a0 think he erred.<br\/><br\/>The provincial fiscal shall\u00a0 represent the provincial and Insular governments in his province in all actions or\u00a0 prosecutions in the Court of First Instance in the manner provided by law.\u00a0 \"He shall be\u00a0 an\u00a0 officer\u00a0 of\u00a0 the court and subject to officials directions in relation to official matters pending in the Court of First\u00a0 Instance.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Sec. 62, Organic Act No. 136.)<br\/><br\/>Act No. 787\u00a0 is \"An Act\u00a0 providing for the organization and government of the Moro Province.\"\u00a0\u00a0 Section 9 of this Act,\u00a0 as amended by section 2 of\u00a0 Act\u00a0 No, 1699, provides that the provincial attorney shall, when the public interests require it, appear and take charge of the prosecutions for the Government in any court within the province.<br\/><blockquote>\"<i>Who shall prosecute crimes in the Moro Province<\/i>. - The prosecution of criminal offenses in the Courts of First Instance of Jolo, Bongao, Zamboanga,\u00a0 Cotabato,\u00a0 and Davao, shall be conducted by the provincial\u00a0 attorney for the Moro Province, until the legislative council shall, in its discretion, provide for the appointment of fiscals assigned to assist the provincial\u00a0 attorney in\u00a0 this\u00a0 work in one\u00a0 or more\u00a0 of the districts of\u00a0 the\u00a0 province.\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\"\u00a0 (Sec.\u00a0\u00a0 21, Act\u00a0 No. 867.)<br\/><br\/>\"The prosecution of offenses held in Iligan,\u00a0 in the district of Lanao, and Dapitan, in the subdistrict of Dapitan, of the Moro Province, shall be conducted by the provincial attorney for the Moro Province, or by the provincial\u00a0 fiscal of Misamis, at the request and under the supervision\u00a0 of the provincial attorney for the Moro Province.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Sec. 22, Act No. 867.)<br\/><\/blockquote>The powers and duties of provincial fiscals and the\u00a0 provincial attorney for the Moro Province, with\u00a0 reference to criminal prosecutions,\u00a0 are\u00a0 of the same character.\u00a0 They conduct and supervise the prosecution of criminal offenses in their respective\u00a0 provinces.\u00a0 In most of the provinces the provincial\u00a0 fiscal, not having any\u00a0 deputy, is required to personally direct the prosecution\u00a0 of all cases, while in the Moro Province the attorney must appear and personally take charge of\u00a0 the prosecution\u00a0 of cases\u00a0 when\u00a0 the\u00a0 public interests require\u00a0 it, but otherwise the prosecution\u00a0 of all such cases is under his supervision and control.\u00a0 In these matters he, as well as the provincial fiscals, is\u00a0 an officer of the court and subject to its discretion.<br\/><br\/>The provision of law authorizing and\u00a0 directing the judge of the\u00a0 Court of First Instance to appoint a temporary fiscal when the regular fiscals fail or refuse to discharge their duty, is not found in Act No. 83, known as \"The\u00a0 Provincial Government Act,\" except as has been added thereto by subsequent legislation.\u00a0 This authority was granted\u00a0 under Act No. 223, which\u00a0 provided that the judge\u00a0 of the\u00a0 Court of First Instance for the province is authorized and required to appoint a temporary provincial fiscal under those circumstances.\u00a0 The word \"provincial\" was dropped in the amendatory Act, No. 1699.\u00a0 The phrase \"The judge of the\u00a0 Court of First Instance for the province is authorized and required to appoint a temporary fiscal,\" is general in its nature.\u00a0 It applies, in the absence of explicit exceptions, to\u00a0 all Courts of First\u00a0 Instance outside of the city of\u00a0 Manila with equal force.\u00a0 There is no provision in Act No. 787, or its amendments, taking this power from the court.\u00a0\u00a0 If the\u00a0 provincial\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 fiscal fails or refuses to discharge his duty in the prosecution of criminal cases, the judge of the Court of First Instance is not only authorized but is required to appoint a temporary fiscal to represent the Government in such cases. The attorney for the Moro Province and his assistant stand in the same position as a provincial fiscal with\u00a0 reference to this matter.\u00a0\u00a0 If the Court of First Instance for the Moro Province did not have authority to\u00a0 appoint a temporary fiscal when the exigencies of the\u00a0 service demanded it,\u00a0 it might occur that the whole court machinery, with reference to criminal cases, would be impeded on account of the refusal on the part of the attorney, or\u00a0 his assistant,\u00a0 to perform their duties.\u00a0\u00a0 The presiding judge of the Court\u00a0 of First Instance for the Moro Province has the power to\u00a0 cause the prosecution of criminal cases to go\u00a0 forward,\u00a0 and if the officer designated by law\u00a0 to\u00a0 prosecute such criminal cases fails\u00a0 or refuses to perform his duty,\u00a0 then\u00a0 the\u00a0 judge or court must relieve such officer temporarily and appoint a qualified person to take his place.<br\/><br\/>The motion presented by the attorney for the Moro Province on the 27th day of December,\u00a0 asking the\u00a0 court to annul that part of the order of December\u00a0 16, 1910,\u00a0 disqualifying\u00a0 him from representing the\u00a0 prosecution in the criminal, case against Edward Dworak was acted\u00a0 upon on the 20th of the following month and granted.\u00a0 The same court that issued the order annulled it. It is not a question of Judge Gale issuing the order and Judge Low annulling it; it is a question of the power of the Court of First Instance to issue and annul\u00a0 said\u00a0 order.\u00a0\u00a0 The fact that\u00a0 different judges took part can not alter or diminish the power of the court - it was one and the same court.\u00a0 The true test is, would Judge Gale have had authority to annul that order in case he had passed upon the motion?\u00a0 We think he would have had such authority.\u00a0 This being true, Judge Low\u00a0 had exactly the same authority that Judge\u00a0 Gale would have had. When the order of December 16 was issued the court\u00a0 had certain facts before it upon which said order was based. When the court annulled this order on January 20 it might have had different and sufficient facts upon which to base this annulling order.\u00a0\u00a0 The special\u00a0 attorney on his appointment became an officer of the court, subject to its direction. The court, if justified by the facts,\u00a0 had authority, under the law, to relieve him and direct the\u00a0 regular provincial attorney to take charge of the case.<br\/><br\/>The petitioner relies upon the doctrine enumerated' m the case of Orais <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs. <\/span>Escano (14 Phil. Rep., 208).\u00a0 In this case the Court of First Instance, Hon.\u00a0 Charles\u00a0 E. Burritt presiding,\u00a0 issued\u00a0 on\u00a0 the 21st of September,\u00a0 1905, an order granting the administratrix permission to sell certain propn erty.\u00a0\u00a0 The same court, Hon. William F. Morris presiding, annulled and set aside the said order on the 24th of June, 1907.\u00a0 From this\u00a0 last order the defendant appealed.\u00a0 The Supreme Court held that under the facts as presented the Court of First Instance erred\u00a0 in setting aside said order. That part of the\u00a0 opinion which refers\u00a0 to\u00a0 the facts is as follows (p. 212):<br\/><blockquote>\"It is not shown that the purchaser of the\u00a0 property, Jacinta Escano, had\u00a0 received any notice of the motion to set aside the sale.\u00a0 Nearly two years had elapsed between the sale and the\u00a0 motion.\u00a0\u00a0 The sale was made under an order of the court.\u00a0\u00a0 The purchaser\u00a0 had\u00a0 a\u00a0 right\u00a0 to believe that the court had complied with the law and that she had, therefore,\u00a0 obtained\u00a0 a good title.\u00a0 Whether she had obtained\u00a0 a good\u00a0 title or not she certainly was\u00a0 entitled to\u00a0 notice before any action was taken by the court\u00a0 by which she should be deprived of her title.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It is true that the court, continuing, said:<br\/><blockquote>\"Judges of coordinate jurisdiction, acting within the same jurisdiction, should not annul or set aside orders made by other judges\u00a0 of equal\u00a0 jurisdiction,\u00a0 until\u00a0 some new fact or condition\u00a0 is presented.\u00a0 The parties should\u00a0 be\u00a0 compelled to take their\u00a0 exception and wait for a final decision, and if not then corrected, to\u00a0 appeal\u00a0 from alleged illegal orders. As a general rule, a judge has no power to review, on the same facts, the decisions of a coordinate judge, the remedy being by appeal.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The\u00a0 decision of the\u00a0 court rests upon the facts as above stated, and not upon these propositions of law.\u00a0 The judge who issued the\u00a0 annulling\u00a0 order\u00a0 succeeded the judge\u00a0 who issued\u00a0 the original order, as presiding judge of the court wherein the case was pending, and, therefore, had precisely the same authority and jurisdiction with regard\u00a0 to\u00a0 that case as his predecessor would have had in the event he had continued as\u00a0 presiding judge until the\u00a0 motion praying the issuance of the annulling order was submitted.\u00a0\u00a0 It was one and the\u00a0 same court that issued both\u00a0 orders.\u00a0\u00a0 If Judge Burritt and Judge Norris had been holding court in Leyte at the\u00a0 same time,\u00a0 and if one had issued the\u00a0 order\u00a0 and the other annulled it while they were both acting in the same province, then the question might have been different.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 facts as alleged\u00a0 in the petition in the case at bar are not sufficient\u00a0 to justify this court\u00a0 in issuing the preliminary injunction.\u00a0 In reaching this conclusion we have unavoidably discussed and practically decided the petitioner's right to his principal remedy.\u00a0 In other words, we have held\u00a0 that under the law the Court of First Instance for the Moro Province has the\u00a0 same power,\u00a0 with reference to the questions under\u00a0 consideration, as courts of\u00a0 other provinces have, and that the court had authority, under the law, to issue the two orders\u00a0 of December 16 and January 20.\u00a0 The\u00a0 allegations in the\u00a0 complaint do not show such an abuse of discretion as would\u00a0 warrant us in issuing an\u00a0 order to show cause\u00a0 and allow this case to go forward.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 preliminary injunction prayed for is,\u00a0 therefore, denied, and if\u00a0 an\u00a0 amended\u00a0 petition is not filed within sixty days, the case will be dismissed, with\u00a0 costs\u00a0 <i>de\u00a0 oficio. <\/i>\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

The deceased Occeno held the position\u00a0 of deputy police officer, Elias Oro was the local president, Simon Rupaz was the vice-president, Aguedo Arboleda, a\u00a0 brother-in-law\u00a0 of Ciriaco Occeno, was the\u00a0 deputy collector of revenue, and Eusebio Oro was\u00a0 the deputy judicial officer.\u00a0 The revolutionary bands were\u00a0 scattered among the mountains, but in the pueblo of Sapian there was not, at that time, any detachment or party of soldiers of the revolution.<br\/><br\/>\"The evidence adduced by the prosecution to prove that the accused in this cause were those who fired several gunshots at Ciriaco\u00a0 Occe\u00f1o, thereby\u00a0 causing his immediate death, is the testimony of the following witnesses:<br\/><br\/>\"Maxima Occe\u00f1o,\u00a0 a sister of the\u00a0 deceased, testified\u00a0 that while she was sleeping, on the day of the crime, she heard shouts of somebody\u00a0 calling Ciriaco, her brother,\u00a0 and on hearing them she got up and said that Ciriaco was not there, as he had\u00a0 moved\u00a0 to his new house; that the calling was renewed and that, then the door of the house was opened and the accused entered; that Leocadio Pajarillo asked her where Ciriaco was,\u00a0 and she replied that\u00a0 he was in Ylaud (toward the shore), and then Leocadio seized the light which she had in her hands and began to light up the kitchen, the room, and other parts of the house,\u00a0 and that as he did not see Ciriaco\u00a0 there\u00a0 the four accused went\u00a0 down\u00a0 out of the house; that, on\u00a0 leaning out of the window, she saw many people going toward\u00a0 Ylaud; that a few moments afterwards she left her house, passing, not through the street door, but through the back part, and went to the house of her father, Mariano Occeno, situated\u00a0 in front of that which was then occupied by the\u00a0 deceased Ciriaco; that she did not succeed in entering the\u00a0 house, because\u00a0 the\u00a0 door was closed,\u00a0 and remained on the\u00a0 stairs; that from there she heard some one cry out, 'Esteban, call Ciriaco,' and that when Ciriaco leaned out of the window,\u00a0 Leocadio ordered them to\u00a0 fire;\u00a0 that, immediately upon\u00a0 this order being given, she heard shots and a few moments later saw Ciriaco's wife lean out of the window and\u00a0 heard her say, 'Leocadio, that is enough, for Ciriaco is already dead;' that on the witness hearing these words she started up the stairs, but Leocadio caught her by the arm and prevented her from going up.<br\/><br\/>\"Esteban Obidos, married to\u00a0 Andrea\u00a0 Guceno,\u00a0 another sister of the\u00a0 deceased,\u00a0 testified that on the morning of the day of the crime, while he was yet asleep, the accused went to his house and called him from below, and when\u00a0 he went down they bound him by both arms and then took him to Ciriaco's house;\u00a0 that,\u00a0 besides the accused,\u00a0 he saw many people in the street, among them a soldier named\u00a0 Fabian; that on arriving at Ciriaco's house, Leocadio ordered the witness to call Ciriaco from the stairs and at first he called him in a low voice, wherefore Leocadio ordered him to call louder; that\u00a0 when the\u00a0 witness cried out\u00a0 the\u00a0 second\u00a0 time in a loud voice, 'Ciriaco, Ciriaco,'\u00a0 the latter leaned out of the door and then Leocadio gave the order to fire; that on Leocadio's\u00a0 giving, for\u00a0 the second time, the order to fire, Ciriaco's wife leaned\u00a0 out and said that her\u00a0 husband was dead; that the accused were armed with guns and revolvers; that after the shooting they went up into Ciriaco's house and took the witness away with them; that the witness then saw Ciriaco dead in the middle of the room; that he also saw Leocadio speak secretly with the wife of the deceased, and then the said Leocadio\u00a0 removed the revolver, the dagger, and the sword, which were hanging from a beam, and\u00a0 then the accused went down out of the house; that witness saw a wound in the upper part of Ciriaco's breast through which much blood flowed.<br\/><br\/>\"Andrea Occe\u00f1o, a sister of the deceased and wife of Esteban Obidos, testified as follows: That on the morning of the crime she was awakened by raps against her house, and they opened the door; then some people, among whom she recognized the accused, came in, who made her husband go down, and, when he went down one of the accused ordered him bound; she followed her husband, who was taken in front of Ciriaco Occe\u00f1o's house, and once there the accused\u00a0 commanded Esteban to call Ciriaco, and as Esteban called in a low voice, Pajarillo, one of the accused, struck him with a bolo to make him call louder; then Esteban called Ciriaco in a loud voice, pronouncing\u00a0 his name several\u00a0 times, and when the latter opened the door Pajarillo said 'Fire,' at this command,\u00a0 four\u00a0 shots\u00a0 were fired in succession, and when Leocadio again said 'Fire,' Ciriaco's wife leaned out of the window and\u00a0 said, 'Leocadio, that is enough, for Ciriaco is dead.'\u00a0 The witness followed\u00a0 the\u00a0 several accused and her husband\u00a0 up into the house\u00a0 and saw that her brother\u00a0 was lying face upwards; while they were there Leocadio saw the deceased and then spoke with Hermenegilda quietly, in such manner that the\u00a0 others\u00a0 could\u00a0 not hear what\u00a0 they were saying; after this, the accused went down,\u00a0 taking Esteban with them, after having: first\u00a0 removed the revolver, saber, and dagger that were\u00a0 hanging in\u00a0 the\u00a0 wardrobe.<br\/><br\/>\"Juliana Olica, who at the time of the crime was a servant of the deceased Ciriaco Occe\u00f1o, testified as follows: That on the morning of the crime Ciriaco's house was surrounded by armed people, and\u00a0 soon her master, Ciriaco,\u00a0 was called three times, and when he went to\u00a0 the\u00a0 door\u00a0 the report of a firearm was heard and he received several\u00a0 bullet\u00a0 wounds; then Ciriaco returned toward the door of the room\u00a0 and there fell; afterwards the\u00a0 accused, all four of whom carried guns, together with Esteban, who was then bound, went up into the house, and once there they took the weapons away from the deceased and then went down; after the\u00a0 deceased had fallen at full length, his wife got up, opened the window, leaned out and said, 'Cadio, that is enough, for Ciriaco\u00a0 is already dead.'<br\/><br\/>\"Marcelo Aguila testified that on\u00a0 the afternoon preceding the day of the crime, Francisco Orleans, one of the accused, went to the barrio in which the witness\u00a0 lived, that of Loctugan, and invited the\u00a0 witness to accompany him to search for a carabao which he had lost; that he accompanied Francisco to the latter's house, situated\u00a0 in Dapdapan, one of the barrios of Sapian, arriving at\u00a0 the said\u00a0 place after\u00a0 the time for the saying of prayers, and when he arrived there there were many people in the house; he there saw the four accused; on the following morning all those people awoke and immediately started out for the town of Sapian; the accused went along at the head of the band and were armed with guns;\u00a0 when they arrived at the town, they first went up into a house,\u00a0 the door of which they forced and opened; the accused entered, but soon afterwards went down; they continued walking and went to another house, the\u00a0 owner of which opened the door; they took him along, bound, and following him was a\u00a0 woman; afterwards they\u00a0 continued walking, and on the way Leocadio told the man that was bound\u00a0 to awaken Ciriaco, and the said man called Ciriaco in a low voice; then Leocadio told him to raise his voice; he did so, and it was then that the master of the house awakened ; when Leocadio perceived that the master, of\u00a0 the house was moving above,\u00a0 he commanded, 'Fire;'\u00a0 after hearing this command of Tire,' witness heard a noise which appeared to have been produced by a man falling.<br\/><br\/>\"Vito Navarra testified that, at the time of the crime, he was a captain of revolutionary soldiers under the command of Sr.\u00a0 Hontiveros; he then had twenty soldiers with eight guns; that on a certain occasion Leocadio Pajarillo\u00a0 wrote a letter to him,\u00a0 soliciting his aid because they had\u00a0 stolen carabaos from the said accused, and as he said that he could not search for them, for he was afraid of the revolutionists, not being one himself, he begged the witness to furnish him with eight soldiers for the search for his animals - a letter that was answered by the witness in the sense that he could not make any provision without first informing his superior; that two or three days afterwards Leocadio Pajarillo went to his,\u00a0 Navarra's, camp in Batin, Mambusao, accompanied by his brother Lino; that on that day some soldiers arrived with the reply from Colonel Hontiveros, granting Pajarillo's petition; that the witness then ordered eight of his soldiers under command of an officer, Lieutenant Federico delos Santos, to proceed to the barrio of Dapdapan, Sapian, and render aid to\u00a0 Pajarillo;\u00a0 that all\u00a0 his soldiers then carried their guns, and when they returned Lieutenant De los Santos reported that the accused put four shots into Ciriaco Occeno, in his own house;

early in the morning of\u00a0 the following day they\u00a0 marched toward the pueblo, and on\u00a0 arriving there they went up\u00a0 into a\u00a0 house from which after a few minutes they went down, and then they went to the house of Esteban, into which the four accused entered; there they\u00a0 seized Esteban, took him\u00a0 below and bound him by order of\u00a0 Leocadio, and then they took him in front of another house,\u00a0 and once there Leocadio ordered Esteban to call Ciriaco; when Esteban called for the second time, 'Ciriaco,' in\u00a0 a loud voice, the witness was able to observe that the door opened and at that moment the four accused fired their guns; that after the first shots Leocadio again\u00a0 ordered them to fire, but a woman in the upper part of the house leaned out of the window and said, 'Cadio, that is enough, for Ciriaco is already dead;' then the accused went up into the house, taking\u00a0 with\u00a0 them Esteban who was\u00a0 already bound.<br\/><br\/>\"Marcelo Lozada, another of the soldiers of Vito Navarra, testified as follows: That by order of his captain, the witness and seven soldiers, under the command\u00a0 of\u00a0 the lieutenant, Federico de los Santos, set out from\u00a0 Batin, on the\u00a0 night previous to the day of\u00a0 the\u00a0 crime, and, oh arriving at Dapdapan, went to the house of Leocadio Pajarillo, where there were\u00a0 many people; at 3 o'clock in the morning Leocadio told him that they had to go out to look for the\u00a0 carabaost and they\u00a0 set\u00a0 out, preceded\u00a0 by the four accused, and on arriving at the\u00a0 town they\u00a0 first went\u00a0 up into\u00a0 a house and from\u00a0 there they went\u00a0 to the house where Esteban lived; the accused there ordered the latter to come down, and when he did so they bound him, and after\u00a0 he was bound they took him to Ciriaco's\u00a0 house; there they told Esteban to awaken Ciriaco, and as he called in a low voice Leocadio unsheathed his saber and\u00a0 struck him on the calf of the leg; then Esteban raised his voice and cried out, 'Ciriaco;' at this moment\u00a0 Ciriaco opened the door and asked, 'Who are you people?' and then Leocadio commanded, 'Fire;' after the\u00a0 first shot had sounded\u00a0 he again ordered them to fire, but at this juncture a woman from within said that Ciriaco was already dead; immediately afterwards the four accused went up into Ciriaco's house; while.this occurred, the soldiers from Mambusao\u00a0 were standing in file in the street.<br\/><br\/>\"Finally, Romualdo Refugio, another of the soldiers from Mambusao, testified in the following\u00a0 manner: That he and his\u00a0 companions\u00a0 went with the four\u00a0 accused, who were armed, to\u00a0 Ciriaco Occeno's\u00a0 house in Sapian;\u00a0 that before arriving at Ciriaco's house, they\u00a0 stopped at three houses, and\u00a0 on arriving at Ciriaco's they\u00a0 called him, and when he leaned out\u00a0 Leocadio\u00a0 immediately\u00a0 said, 'Fire,' then a shot was heard and then he again ordered them to load, at which juncture a woman said that Ciriaco was already dead; that afterwards\u00a0 the accused\u00a0 went\u00a0 up into\u00a0 the\u00a0 house, taking Esteban with\u00a0 them.<br\/><br\/>\"On the\u00a0 other\u00a0 hand the evidence of the defense tends to establish:<br\/><br\/>\"1.

Vito, in order that the latter might release them, to which Pajarillo answered in these words: 'How\u00a0 can you be released\u00a0 if you are traitors?\u00a0 Your <i>presidente<\/i> said that you were going to surrender to the Americans.'<br\/><br\/>\"Federico de los Santos, the lieutenant sent by Vito Navarra with a platoon of soldiers to Sapian, testified as follows: That early in the morning of the day of the crime they set out from\u00a0 Dapdapan, the residence of Leocadio\u00a0 Pajarillo, going in the direction of the pueblo of Sapian; but before arriving at the pueblo,\u00a0 they stopped in\u00a0 a place called Janlid or Catadman, lodging in the house of one Andres Olandezca; while they were breakfasting there\u00a0 they heard shots that were fired in\u00a0 the pueblo of Sapian; Pajarillo\u00a0 asked what that was,\u00a0 and the witness answered that it must be some knavish tricks of the soldiers; after breakfast they started out for Sapian and while entering the pueblo met several <i>macheteros<\/i> who informed them that Ciriaco Occe\u00f1o had been shot.<br\/><br\/>\"In the midst of this conflicting testimony, who told the truth - the witnesses for the prosecution\u00a0 or\u00a0 those for the defense?\u00a0 There are six witnesses of the prosecution who, at the trial, stated in a positive and decided manner that they saw the accused in this cause, in front of the house\u00a0 of the deceased Ciriaco\u00a0 Occe\u00f1o, aim\u00a0 their guns toward the door of the\u00a0 house and discharge two shots,\u00a0 on the command of 'Fire,'\u00a0 given by Leocadio Pajarillo, who was acting as chief\u00a0 of the band, at the person\u00a0 who approached the door, who turned out to be Ciriaco Occe\u00f1o himself and was called, also by order of Leocadio, by Esteban Obidos, a brother-in-law of the deceased, who had been captured and bound in his house a few moments prior\u00a0 to going to Occe\u00f1o's house.\u00a0 Of these witnesses, three are near relatives of the deceased and the other three are outsiders, two of which latter belonged to the platoon of revolutionary soldiers sent by Vito Navarra to Dapdapan at the request of the accused, Leocadio Pajarillo.<br\/><br\/>\"All of them swore that they\u00a0 were eyewitnesses of the crime, and from their testimony it is clearly concluded that they were in such positions that they could see perfectly well what occurred beside the stairs of Ciriaco\u00a0 Occeno's house. One of these witnesses, Esteban Arevalo,\u00a0 was accused\u00a0 of having been\u00a0 one of the authors of the death of Ciriaco Occeno, and\u00a0 although the value of his\u00a0 testimony\u00a0 might be assailed, as coming from a person who naturally has a special interest\u00a0 in clearing himself from the liability that might be exacted of him because of OccenoV death, however the testimony of the others stands, and undoubtedly must merit credit, unless its probative force\u00a0 has been successfully impugned by the defense.\u00a0\u00a0 The mere circumstance of Maxima Occeno, Andrea Occeno, and Eteban Obidos being the sisters and\u00a0 brother\u00a0 of the\u00a0 deceased,\u00a0 is not a\u00a0 sufficient\u00a0 reason\u00a0 to reject their testimony as devoid of truth on\u00a0 account of partiality and interestedness, much less if, as in the present case, such testimony appears to be corroborated by persons entirely unrelated to the family.<br\/><br\/>\"The defense also presented several witnesses, some of whom positively declared that those who shot Ciriaco Occeno were\u00a0 Cornelio\u00a0 Guerra, Fabian Arevalo, and Esteban Arevalo, three soldiers who\u00a0 came from Mambusao by order of Vito Navarra; while others of them limited their testimony to the\u00a0 statement that, at the moment of the crime, they did not see the accused\u00a0 in this cause in front of Ciriaco Occeno's house.\u00a0 The widow and the daughter of the deceased Were\u00a0 inside the house and, although they averred that they saw the men who discharged their guns at the deceased Occeiio,\u00a0 it is most probable that\u00a0 at the moment Ciriaco received the bullets they were, inside the house still lying down and\u00a0 that Ciriaco\u00a0 was the only\u00a0 one\u00a0 who\u00a0 approached the door.\u00a0 Were it true that the wife accompanied her husband to the door and that she was very close to him, it would appear unlikely that she should have entirely escaped all harm, notwithstanding the fact that four guns were discharged at\u00a0 one time.\u00a0 Catalina Olaso, Florentina\u00a0 Ocbina, Francisco Otro, and\u00a0 Andres Nunez,\u00a0 who testified to their having\u00a0 seen three persons\u00a0 discharge their guns in front of Ciriaco Occe\u00f1o's\u00a0 house and that none of the accused were among\u00a0 these\u00a0 three\u00a0 persons, were, at the moment\u00a0 of\u00a0 the occurrence,\u00a0 in their respective houses at quite a distance from Occe\u00f1o's, and\u00a0 they\u00a0 themselves admitted that they witnessed the crime under considerably abnormal conditions; now listening through a hole or partition,\u00a0 now briefly and rapidly glancing\u00a0 toward the place of the\u00a0 occurrence, and therefore they did not have a\u00a0 full opportunity to\u00a0 observe all the\u00a0 particulars and details\u00a0 of\u00a0 the crime.\u00a0 Of the witnesses of the defense, only Mariano de la Cruz and Diosdado Onrade pretend, according to their testimony to have been in company with the men who discharged\u00a0 their guns\u00a0 at Ciriaco\u00a0 Occeno.<br\/><br\/>\"The defense desires to attribute great importance to the fact\u00a0 that the\u00a0 widow and\u00a0 the daughter\u00a0 of\u00a0 the deceased testified in\u00a0 favor of the accused,\u00a0 as likewise did another sister of his named Catalina, for the purpose of disproving the testimony\u00a0 given by the other sisters, Andrea and Maxima, and Andrea's husband.\u00a0 On these premises the\u00a0 defense established the conclusion\u00a0 that Maxima, Andrea,\u00a0 and Esteban Obidos\u00a0 testified falsely,\u00a0 because, were it true that Ciriaco\u00a0 had\u00a0 been\u00a0 shot to death\u00a0 by the accused, the widow, the daughter,\u00a0 and the other sister of the\u00a0 deceased would have united\u00a0 with\u00a0 those three witnesses for the prosecution in a common\u00a0 cause\u00a0 for the purpose\u00a0 of incriminating the accused. There is in this cause serious circumstantial evidence tending to show that the motive of Leocadio Pajarillo's\u00a0\u00a0 causing the death of Ciriaco Occeno consisted in that there existed unlawful and criminal relations between the widow of the\u00a0 deceased\u00a0 and the accused, Leocadio\u00a0 Pajarillo.\u00a0 Although the direct evidence introduced with regard to\u00a0 this feature is not entirely satisfactory, the subsequent conduct of the\u00a0 widow appears\u00a0 to confirm such suppositions.\u00a0\u00a0 The indifference\u00a0 shown\u00a0 by her at the time\u00a0 of her husband's death gives room to presume that she was not very desirous of prosecuting the murderers of her husband.<br\/><br\/>\"The testimony of Hermenegilda Oro, imputing the shooting of\u00a0 her husband to\u00a0 Cornelio\u00a0 Guerra, Fabian Arevalo, and Vito\u00a0 Navarra, is\u00a0 extremely suspicious.\u00a0 Were these latter really those who killed Ciriaco, it\u00a0 is not understood why she made no claim nor presented any complaint whatever against Navarra and his soldiers until two days after a\u00a0 complaint had been presented in the justice of the peace court of\u00a0 Capiz\u00a0 against Leocadio Pajarillo\u00a0 and the other accused in this cause, on the 17th of February, 1906; whereby it is seen that the sole purpose of imputing the crime to the soldiers of Vito Navarra was to neutralize and bring to naught the action tiled against the accused.\u00a0 Since\u00a0 the deceased died, up to the time that the complaint was filed by Hermenegilda Oro\u00a0 against Navarra\u00a0 and his soldiers, nearly six years elapsed, during, which the\u00a0 municipal government of Sapian and the\u00a0 administration of justice therein were placed\u00a0 into the hands of\u00a0 Leocadio Pajarillo and to persons closely\u00a0 related to him.\u00a0\u00a0 This very circumstance explains why a complaint could not immediately be filed against Leocadio Pajarilo and his brothers by any person aggrieved\u00a0 or interested\u00a0 in the prosecution\u00a0 of this crime, charging them with the murder of Ciriaco Occeno.<br\/><br\/>\"After a careful consideration of the motives entertained by the witnesses of one side and of the other to distort\u00a0 the facts; the opportunity they all had to observe the acts as they occurred; the greater or lesser influence which the accused in this cause, who, since the day of the crime, have exercised unlimited power in\u00a0 Sapian, have been able\u00a0 to\u00a0 wield over them;\u00a0 and,\u00a0 finally, the form and manner\u00a0 in\u00a0 which they testified at the trial, it having been noted that the witnesses for the defense gave their testimony in a uniform, unnatural and studied manner, while those of the prosecution testified with the dullness that is natural in witnesses of scant education, the court is of the opinion that in the present case the truth\u00a0 lies\u00a0 with the\u00a0 witnesses for the prosecution and, therefore,\u00a0 that the facts to which they testified are certain and true,\u00a0 so that\u00a0 it can not but establish\u00a0 the conclusion that the accused in this\u00a0 cause,\u00a0 under the direction\u00a0 and orders of Leocadio\u00a0 Pajarillo, were those who, provided with firearms, caused the death of Ciriaco Occe\u00f1o in the latter's own house, and that they\u00a0 have not proved their alibi to the satisfaction of\u00a0 this court.<br\/><br\/>\"We come now to the second question raised by the accused, Leocadio Pajarillo, who invokes in\u00a0 his\u00a0 behalf the benefits of the Proclamation of Amnesty\u00a0 of the\u00a0 President of the\u00a0 United States, of\u00a0 July 4, 1902 - a\u00a0 defense\u00a0 which has not been invoked by the other accused in this\u00a0 cause. In the first place, it appears to the court illogical and absurd that the accused should\u00a0 now wish to rely upon the benefits of that proclamation of\u00a0 amnesty when he not only endeavored to prove an alibi by denying the least connection with the death of Ciriaco Occe\u00f1o, but also, besides, attributed the death of the said Occe\u00f1o to\u00a0 other persons.\u00a0 We have read with considerable care all the reported cases of the Supreme Court of these Islands on\u00a0 the matter of amnesty, and we have observed that the benefits\u00a0 of\u00a0 the same have been extended to accused who, although they did not admit their guilt, yet in their testimony\u00a0 admitted their greater or less participation in the crime\u00a0 charged to them.\u00a0\u00a0 It has\u00a0 sometimes occurred\u00a0 that the accused did not admit at the hearing of the case, their participation in the crime, yet, in order to receive the benefits of the\u00a0 proclamation of amnesty, they had to subscribe affidavits admitting the commission of the crime.\u00a0 (U. S.\u00a0 <i>vs.<\/i> Repollo, 2 Phil. Rep., 195, 227.)<br\/><br\/>\"This seems\u00a0 to be the most rational point of view and the one most in accord with common\u00a0 sense, because \"amnesty\" means \"complete pardon and total oblivion of certain political crimes, granted and decreed by the sovereign by virtue of the power and authority conferred upon him by the constitutional law,\" and illy can it be said that one can be\u00a0 pardoned who does not\u00a0 acknowledge his having been guilty of any wrong, but who, on the contrary, tries to prove his innocence.<br\/><br\/>\"However, we may lay aside these disquisitions and decide, after an examination, of the evidence presented by the accused, Leocadio Pajarillo, whether such evidence really entitles him to\u00a0 the\u00a0 benefits and\u00a0 rights\u00a0 conferred by the Proclamation of Amnesty of July 4, 1902.<br\/><br\/>\"The circumstances that accompanied the, death of Ciriaco Occeno are very strange.\u00a0 The deceased at that time held the position\u00a0 of deputy police officer for the revolutionary municipal government of Sapian, and on the same day that Ciriaco Occe\u00f1o was shot the other municipal officers were captured and detained by\u00a0 order of the accused,\u00a0 Leocadio Pajarillo.\u00a0 After killing Ciriaco Occe\u00f1o, Leocadio and the people accompanying him passed on to the house of Aguedo Arboleda, Occeno's brother-in-law, who was then deputy collector of revenue, and took him away, bound;\u00a0 then Leocadio ordered barotos\u00a0 to be\u00a0 prepared and they set out in the direction of a barrio in which the president, Elias Oro, was, and captured him also.\u00a0 Simon Tupaz, the vice-president, was also\u00a0 captured.\u00a0 When these facts occurred - that is, in May, 1900 - the\u00a0 revolution in\u00a0 the Province of Capiz had not yet been entirely suppressed and many of the revolutionary\u00a0 chiefs were\u00a0 roaming, dispersed,\u00a0 through\u00a0 the mountains without\u00a0 wishing to submit to American sovereignty, while only a few of the pueblos were garrisoned by American troops.\u00a0\u00a0 On that day Sapian\u00a0 had not yet been occupied by\u00a0 American troops.\u00a0 Moreover, on the day of the occurrence of all these acts, the death of Ciriaco Occe\u00f1o and the capture of\u00a0 the other municipal officers of Sapian, Pajarillo counted on the assistance of revolutionary soldiers whom Captain\u00a0 Vito Navarra sent to him from M^mbusao. The evidence is at variance with respect to the reason why these\u00a0 soldiers were\u00a0 sent to\u00a0 aid\u00a0 Pajarillo.\u00a0 Vito\u00a0 Navarra testified that he sent these soldiers to Pajarillo because the latter had asked aid to search for some carabaos which had been stolen from him.\u00a0 On\u00a0 the\u00a0 other\u00a0 hand,\u00a0 the accused, Leocadio Pajarillo,\u00a0 testified\u00a0 that he\u00a0 requested that force to aid him in capturing the\u00a0 president and the deputies in Sapian,\u00a0 for the reason that\u00a0 he had conceived them to\u00a0 be traitors to\u00a0 the Filipino cause, as\u00a0 a few\u00a0 days before\u00a0 he had had information that they wished to surrender to\u00a0 the American forces, and that he made such request, moreover, because he believed that the forces at\u00a0 his disposal were unable to effect\u00a0 the said capture.<br\/><br\/>\"The defense introduced as a witness Ananias Diokno, a general of the revolution, who\u00a0 testified that Pajarillo was at that time a jefe stationed\u00a0 in the pueblo of Sapian with his forces of macheteros and\u00a0 some guns.\u00a0 Notwithstanding that the prosecution\u00a0 tried to deny that Leocadio Pajarillo was vested with the character\u00a0 of jefe or revolutionary officer, the\u00a0 record shows sufficient evidence\u00a0 in proof\u00a0 of\u00a0 the fact that he did take some part in the insurrection of the Filipinos against the Americans, or, at the least, that\u00a0 he rendered protection and aid to those who participated in that insurrection.<br\/><br\/>\"However, the Supreme Court\u00a0 of these\u00a0 Islands has decided that the simple fact of a crime having been committed during the revolution, by persons pertaining to the forces thereof, is not a sufficient ground for the granting of amnesty,\u00a0 unless it be proved that the crime committed was of a political nature or grew out\u00a0 of political feuds or dis- sensions.\u00a0 (U. S.\u00a0 <i>vs<\/i>. Luzon,\u00a0 2 Phil.\u00a0 Rep., 380; U.\u00a0 S. <i>vs.<\/i> Mabilangan, 2 Phil. Rep., 397; U. S.\u00a0 <i>vs.<\/i> Cajayon, 2 Phil. Rep., 570.)\u00a0\u00a0 Affirmative proof\u00a0 is required that the crime had its origin in internal political feuds or\u00a0 dissensions and that facts be proved at the trial which bring the case within the conditions prescribed in\u00a0 the said\u00a0 proclamation of am- nesty.\u00a0\u00a0 (U,\u00a0 S. <i>vs<\/i>.

Correa, 1 Phil. Rep., 549.)<br\/><br\/>\"Leocadio\u00a0 Pajarillo\u00a0 testified that he captured the ,president, Elias Oro, and his deputies, one of whom was Ciriaco Oecefio, because he had information that they were\u00a0 going to surrender to the Americans.\u00a0\u00a0 The evidence as a whole, adduced\u00a0 at the trial, does\u00a0 not in any\u00a0 manner corroborate the allegation of Leocadio\u00a0 Pajarillo in this\u00a0 particular; the record shows that those captured were as much in sympathy with the revolutionary government as Leocadio Pajarillo himself.\u00a0 Only\u00a0 a month prior to the day of the crime the most influential and prominent\u00a0 men\u00a0 of\u00a0 Sapian resolved, under\u00a0 the presidency\u00a0 of Elias\u00a0 Oro, to collect a monthly subscription of funds for the revolution, in compliance with a circular issued by the general of the\u00a0 expeditionary forces of the\u00a0 province; and, a few days after\u00a0 the crime, Elias Oro himself appeared, not\u00a0 before any American authority, but before Col. S. Hontiveros, who was then camped in Mambusao, to report the vexation to which he was subjected by Leocadio\u00a0 Pajarillo.\u00a0 Judging\u00a0 from\u00a0 the\u00a0 fact\u00a0 that,\u00a0 after the capture of Elias Oro and his deputies, Leocadio Pajarillo set himself up as the chief officer of the pueblo and had himself chosen as its president, it\u00a0 is seen that the real object that Leocadio had in view in capturing the president and his deputies was no other than that\u00a0 of overthrowing and suppressing the former's power and influence in order that he himself might\u00a0 assume the command and political supremacy in the pueblo.\u00a0 It has been insinuated by the defense that this act is one eminently seditious; yet, withal, such seditious act not having been committed nor directed against either the\u00a0 Spanish sovereignty\u00a0 or\u00a0 the American sovereignty, it\u00a0 does not constitute the crime of sedition that\u00a0 is\u00a0 pardoned, as an eminently political crime, under the proclamation of amnesty. We do not believe that the\u00a0 intention of the President of the United States was to include\u00a0 in his proclamation of July 4, 1902, any seditious act whatever not contrary to the sovereignty legally established, in such wise as to comprise under its\u00a0 protection\u00a0 the\u00a0 acts\u00a0 executed by\u00a0 revolutionists against the revolutionary government or its agents,\u00a0 which is what\u00a0 occurred\u00a0 in the present case.\u00a0\u00a0 Leocadio Pajarillo, by capturing Elias Oro and\u00a0 his\u00a0 deputies, did not rebel against the Spanish Government, nor against the American Government, but against the government of the revolution of which Elias\u00a0 Oro and the other municipal officers were the representatives in the municipality of Sapian.<br\/><br\/>\"The record does not show, either, that the capture of Elias Oro,\u00a0 nor, much less, the death of Ciriaco Occeno, was ordered by a superior, officer of the accused Leocadio Pajarillo.\u00a0\u00a0 They were the personal and voluntary acts of the said accused.\u00a0 Nor was it proved\u00a0 that by such acts the cause\u00a0 of the revolution was\u00a0 furthered and strengthened, but, on the contrary, such acts were the subject of investigation by the revolutionary authorities themselves.\u00a0\u00a0 The only question that remains for discussion is whether the capture of Elias Oro and\u00a0 the\u00a0 shooting of Ciriaco\u00a0 Occeno were, in effect, the\u00a0 result of internal political feuds or dissensions between\u00a0 the accused Pajarillo and the municipal officers of that epoch in Sapian.\u00a0 The record of the trial does not reveal the\u00a0 existence of any animosity,\u00a0 prior to the crime, between\u00a0 the accused,\u00a0 Leocadio Pajarillo, and his\u00a0 victims. Both\u00a0 Elias Oro and Ciriaco Occeiio and\u00a0 the other deputies, far from belonging to a contrary band, fought with Leocadio Pajarillo himself,\u00a0 in the revolutionary ranks, and neither during the insurrection against\u00a0 Spain, nor during the insurrection\u00a0 against the\u00a0 United States, did Elias Oro and his deputies have dissensions and feuds, of a political character, with\u00a0 the accused.\u00a0 That not all the municipal officers\u00a0 of Sapian were killed, and only one\u00a0 of them, gives much color to the theory that the\u00a0 motive which impelled Leocadio Pajarillo to take the life of\u00a0 Ciriaco\u00a0 Occeno,\u00a0 was a purely personal one, and had no\u00a0 political\u00a0 character and\u00a0 no connection whatever with the revolution.\u00a0 The Supreme Court\u00a0 of these Islands has been quite liberal in its application of the\u00a0 terms of the Proclamation of Amnesty, but, even so, after\u00a0 consulting the precedents,\u00a0 we\u00a0 do\u00a0 not find that its liberality ever extended to cases\u00a0 where, as in\u00a0 the present one, the political character of the crime under prosecution has\u00a0 not been proved in a positive\u00a0 manner.<br\/><br\/>\"In view of all the preceding reasons, our opinion is that the benefits of the amnesty should be denied to the accused, Leocadio Pajarillo.<br\/><br\/>\"The findings of\u00a0 fact\u00a0 established by the court, in view of all the evidence adduced at the\u00a0 trial, are the following:<br\/><br\/>\"1.\u00a0 That the accused in this cause are the authors, by direct participation, of the death\u00a0 of Ciriaco Occe\u00f1o.<br\/><br\/>\"2. That the said death, on account of the treacherous and unexpected manner of its execution,\u00a0 must\u00a0 be qualified as murder.<br\/><br\/>\"3. That the accused, Leocadio\u00a0 Pajarillo, has not proved facts which entitle him to be included within the terms of the Proclamation of Amnesty for the purpose of receiving the benefits thereof.<br\/><br\/>\"For all the foregoing reasons,\u00a0 and the concurrence of no other circumstance modifying the responsibility\u00a0 except the qualifying circumstance of treachery\u00a0 having satisfactorily been proven, the court finds that\u00a0 Leocadio Pajarillo, Tranquilino Pajarillo, Juan Pajarillo, and Francisco Orleans are guilty of the crime\u00a0 of murder and\u00a0 sentences each of them to the penalty of cadena perpettia,\u00a0 with\u00a0 the accessories of article 54 of the Penal Code, to indemnify jointly and severally the heirs of the deceased in the sum of P1,000 Philippine currency, and each to pay one-fourth part of the costs of the trial.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>After a thorough review of the\u00a0 original record, including the testimony\u00a0 of all the witnesses\u00a0 taken at the trial, we are satisfied, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the evidence sustains the judgment of conviction by the trial judge.<br\/><br\/>The theory\u00a0 of the defense as presented by the principal witness for the\u00a0 accused,\u00a0 Hermenegilda Oro, the widow of the deceased,\u00a0 corroborated\u00a0 by four\u00a0 alleged eyewitnesses of the crime, is that Ciriaco Occeno was murdered by the revolutionary officer, Vito Navarra, and three of his soldiers; the theory of the prosecution as presented by the complaining witness, Maxima Occeno, sister of the deceased, corroborated by seven alleged eyewitnesses of the crime, is\u00a0 that the deceased was murdered by the four defendants.\u00a0 The deceased was done to death by one party or the other.\u00a0\u00a0 The contradictions in the evidence of record can not be attributed to possible mistakes\u00a0 of the witnesses as to the identity of the murderers.\u00a0\u00a0 Leocadio Pajarillo and his codefendants must have been well known,\u00a0 personally, or by sight, to most if not all of the witnesses; and the details given by the opposing groups of witnesses are of such character as to preclude the possibility that they could have mistaken Leocadio Pajarillo and his codefendants for Vito Navarra and his three soldiers.\u00a0 It will\u00a0 be seen at once, therefore, that the adjudication of the guilt or innocence of the defendants necessarily involves a\u00a0 finding that one set\u00a0 or the other of the witnesses testified falsely, and that this false testimony was given knowing it to be false and as a result of a conspiracy entered into for that purpose by the perjurers.<br\/><br\/>The trial judge was of opinion that the testimony of the witnesses for the defense is false in all\u00a0 its essential and material details, and that the story told by the witnesses for the prosecution is true and furnishes a substantially correct account of the killing of Ciriaco Occeno as it actually occurred.\u00a0 He arrived at his conclusions\u00a0 after seeing and hearing the witnesses testify in open court during the course of a hotly contested trial at which most of them were subjected to rigid and exhaustive cross-examination.\u00a0 We find nothing in the record which puts in doubt the soundness of his conclusions as\u00a0 to the relative credibility of the witnesses and the inferences to be drawn from the testimony furnished by them.\u00a0 On the contrary, we are satisfied that he correctly gauged the value\u00a0 ft the evidence, and that the\u00a0 probative facts as found by\u00a0 him were established at the trial beyond a reasonable doubt.<br\/><br\/>The accurate and quite exhaustive summary of the testimony set out in the opinion of the trial court renders it unnecessary for us to enter at this time upon an extended examination\u00a0 in detail of the evidence of record; we shall limit ourselves, therefore, to an attempt briefly to indicate the line of reasoning, based on a general review of all the testimony taken as a whole, which inclines us to accept the findings of the trial court and\u00a0 strengthens us in our belief that he accurately gauged the\u00a0 respective credibility of the witnesses for the prosecution and the defense.<br\/><br\/>The defendants are shown to be members of a prominent and influential family in the community where the crime was committed.\u00a0 Since the commission of the crime, one of them,\u00a0 Leocadio Pajarillo, held\u00a0 the\u00a0 office\u00a0 of municipal president\u00a0 for a period of four years and had been elected a member of the Philippine Assembly not long\u00a0 before this case was brought on for trial; and another, Juan Pajarillo, held the office of municipal president for a\u00a0 period of two years.\u00a0 Through the filing of the complaint\u00a0 and the preliminary proceedings in the court of the justice of the peace they had been fully apprised of the nature of the charges against them, and of the evidence upon which these charges were based,\u00a0 long\u00a0 before\u00a0 the trial\u00a0 was held in\u00a0 the\u00a0 Court of First Instance.\u00a0\u00a0 Thus they were given every opportunity to concert their defense, and it would seem that if the story told\u00a0 by the witnesses for the\u00a0 prosecution were false, the defendants could not have failed to\u00a0 discover and develop the inherent weakness of such a fabrication and to lay bare the improper motives which, if they were testifying falsely, must have actuated the principal witnesses for the prosecution.\u00a0 And\u00a0 yet\u00a0 the record fails utterly to\u00a0 disclose the existence\u00a0 of\u00a0 any\u00a0 other motive\u00a0 actuating\u00a0 the two sisters and the brother-in-law of the deceased in testifying against these defendants than\u00a0 an intense desire to vindicate the memory and\u00a0 revenge the\u00a0 death of their murdered brother. It is impossible to believe that, without some exceptionally powerful motive, these members of the family of the deceased would enter into a conspiracy to bear false witness against the defendants in this case,\u00a0 and\u00a0 thus\u00a0 fasten such a Crime upon four of their neighbors whom they know to be innocent, and at the same time let the real murderers of their brother go unpunished, well knowing,\u00a0 as they do, who those murderers are; and we find it almost as difficult to believe\u00a0 that\u00a0 if\u00a0 such motive\u00a0 did exist, it\u00a0 could have remained unknown to these defendants.\u00a0 The absence of all evidence as to an improper motive\u00a0 actuating the principal witnesses for the prosecution strongly tends, under the circumstances of this\u00a0 case, to sustain the\u00a0 conclusion\u00a0 that no such improper motive\u00a0 existed and that their testimony is worthy, of\u00a0 full faith arid credit.<br\/><br\/>True, the widow of the deceased, their daughter,\u00a0 and one of his sisters testified on behalf of the defendants.\u00a0 But proof of the wicked and perverted\u00a0 motive which actuated the widow, and\u00a0 doubtless indirectly influenced those who were subject to her control, is not lacking in the record; and when four members of a powerful, influential and well-to-do family\u00a0 are\u00a0 on trial, with their lives or liberty at stake, it requires no great effort of the imagination to\u00a0 understand that if they are\u00a0 in\u00a0 fact guilty of\u00a0 the crime with which they are charged, motives will not be wanting to induce potential witnesses for the\u00a0 prosecution\u00a0 to forget their wrongs and testify on\u00a0 behalf of the defense.\u00a0 Of\u00a0 course, we would not be justified in\u00a0 assuming such motives\u00a0 for the\u00a0 purpose of discrediting the witnesses\u00a0 for the defense, but absence of proof as to the existence of improper motives actuating some of the witnesses for the defense in this case has\u00a0 by\u00a0 no means the persuasive force in support of their probable credibility tjiat springs from\u00a0 absence of proof of improper motives actuating the principal witnesses for the\u00a0 prosecution.<br\/><br\/>The witnesses for the prosecution are for the most part ignorant and simple-minded peasants.\u00a0 It appears that\u00a0 the prosecuting witness is\u00a0 not\u00a0 able to\u00a0 read or write.\u00a0 They were assembled at'the\u00a0 trial\u00a0 from\u00a0 widely separated municipalities in the Island of Panay, Iloilo, Capiz, Mambusao, Lutugan, and Sigma.\u00a0 The story told by them of the murder, of the local conditions\u00a0 at the time when\u00a0 it was committed, of the incidents which led up to\u00a0 it and of succeeding event's, is consistent with itself, convincing in its directness and simplicity, and is marked with all the indicia of truth. Their testimony differed only on matters as to which such differences might naturally be expected, as a result of their different points of observation and their varying individual capacity to recall the details of incidents which took place a number of years\u00a0 prior to the date of the trial.\u00a0 Exhaustive cross-examination instead\u00a0 of serving its apparent purpose, that of impeaching these witnesses,\u00a0 \"only\u00a0 added to the weight\u00a0 of their testimony.\"\u00a0 Able and\u00a0 experienced counsel on appeal have failed utterly to develop any just criticism of\u00a0 the material testimony of these\u00a0 witnesses. Such apparent contradictions, omissions, and\u00a0 inaccuracies as are\u00a0 developed in\u00a0 the brief of the appellants add to, rather than detract from, the credibility of the recorded testimony. While\u00a0 not in their nature\u00a0 of such\u00a0 gravity as\u00a0 to\u00a0 put in doubt the truth of\u00a0 the material testimony\u00a0 of the witnesses for the prosecution, these contradictions and omissions tend very strongly to negative any suggestion that this testimony is a mere fabrication, a story learned by\u00a0 rote before\u00a0 the trial to be\u00a0 repeated, parrot-like,\u00a0 on\u00a0 the\u00a0 witness\u00a0 stand. Thus,\u00a0 the fact that these witnesses are\u00a0 not\u00a0 in\u00a0 complete accord as to\u00a0 the precise words which Hermenegilda Oro used when she appeared at the window and\u00a0 told the defendants that their victim was already\u00a0 dead, and that they are not all agreed as to the exact number of shots fired, and that none of them attempted to name the defendant\u00a0 whose shot entered the breast\u00a0 of the deceased, in no wise tends to put in doubt the substantial truth of the facts to which they testified, or that they were all endeavoring to give a true account of the incident as they saw it and remembered it, though it does suggest that each of them was1 speaking from his or her own information and\u00a0 belief;\u00a0 And\u00a0 yet if the story told by the witnesses for the\u00a0 prosecution is false, it must have\u00a0 been\u00a0 fabricated for them by\u00a0 some interested person.\u00a0 Ignorant and simple-minded people that they are, they\u00a0 might have been capable of giving false\u00a0 testimony, but they were utterly incapable\u00a0 of forging a chain of evidence that would\u00a0 bear the slightest resemblance to the truth.\u00a0 Some powerful influence\u00a0 must have been\u00a0 at work to assemble so many\u00a0 false witnesses from different localities and weld their falsehoods together in such a manner that each\u00a0 corroborated all the others, and\u00a0 all\u00a0 were unassailable on cross-examination.\u00a0 Even with the connivance and assistance of the prosecuting officer in\u00a0 charge of the trial in the court below, it would seem that the story told by these witnesses,\u00a0 if false, must have broken down under the cross-examination of counsel instructed by\u00a0 these defendants, intelligent men\u00a0 that they\u00a0 are, and\u00a0 fully and\u00a0 accurately informed as they must have been of\u00a0 the\u00a0 life history of all of the witnesses and of the details of all the occurrences to which these witnesses testified.\u00a0 Without the connivance of the prosecuting officer in charge of the trial in a wicked conspiracy to convict four men known to him to be innocent and acquit four men known to him to be guilty of one of the gravest offenses penalized in the\u00a0 code, it seems to us quite\u00a0 impossible\u00a0 that these ignorant\u00a0 witnesses could\u00a0 have borne themselves in open court so as to deceive the skilled and experienced judge who presided throughout the course of the trial, or that their testimony, when reduced\u00a0 to writing should be\u00a0 unassailable\u00a0 at\u00a0 any material point, despite the rigid\u00a0 scrutiny to which it\u00a0 was subjected by able counsel on appeal.\u00a0\u00a0 But the record clearly discloses that, the prosecution throughout\u00a0 the course of the trial in\u00a0 the court below, from the time when the information was filed and the witnesses assembled, fifteen days\u00a0 before it began, until the, appeal was taken to this court, was\u00a0 under the direct and active personal control of an American attorney, detailed from the Attorney-General's Office in Manila for\u00a0 that purpose.\u00a0 In the absence\u00a0 of all\u00a0 evidence to\u00a0 connect\u00a0 him with such a conspiracy, and in the absence of any showing that any of the\u00a0 prosecuting officers were directly or indiredly interested in the local feuds or neighborhood quarrels of the distant province where this case was tried, there is no reasonable ground on which to base even a suspicion that they\u00a0 lent any aid\u00a0 or\u00a0 comfort to the alleged conspirators. Indeed, as we have said before, in the absence of all evidence disclosing a motive for the bearing of false witness by the principal witnesses called for the prosecution, or disclosing the existence of a conspiracy to suborn these witnesses, and in view of the convincing character of the testimony given by them, we have no reason to question the findings of the trial court as to their credibility and honesty in testifying to, facts which,\u00a0 if true, establish the guilt of these defendants beyond a reasonable\u00a0 doubt.<br\/><br\/>If the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution\u00a0 is true,\u00a0 it follows necessarily that the account of the death of her husband, as given by his widow,\u00a0 Hermenegilda Oro, and the witnesses\u00a0 who were called\u00a0 to corroborate her,\u00a0 is false\u00a0 in all\u00a0 its material details.\u00a0 The\u00a0 Attorney-General's brief\u00a0 contains a critical review of the testimony for the defense, wherein he comments\u00a0 at some\u00a0 length on\u00a0 what he regards as the inherent weakness\u00a0 and the patent improbability of this testimony; but\u00a0 we\u00a0 are\u00a0 compelled to admit that, aside from the powerful impeachment of the testimony of Hermenegilda Oro, which is furnished by the recorded history of this case, we do not\u00a0 find such inconsistencies or contradictions,\u00a0 such\u00a0 palpable\u00a0 improbability or\u00a0 inherent weakness in the evidence offered by the defense, as would justify us in holding it to be false if there were any reasonable doubt in our minds as to the credibility of the witnesses for the prosecution or the truth of the story told by them. Some contradictions there undoubtedly are; the\u00a0 evidence in support of the alibi set up by the\u00a0 different defendants\u00a0 is not very satisfactory; taken as a whole the written record of the testimony submitted by the defense is not convincing, but, as we have said, these defects in themselves are not so marked as to sustain\u00a0 a finding, based solely on a critical review\u00a0 of the recorded testimony, of the falsity of\u00a0 this evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.\u00a0 Under the circumstances,\u00a0 however, the opinion of the trial judge who saw and heard these witnesses testify\u00a0 is of the utmost\u00a0 value, and he tells us that from their appearance and manner of testifying on\u00a0 the witness stand he\u00a0 was as strongly convinced that they testified falsely as he was that the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution\u00a0 was worthy of\u00a0 belief. This, together with our belief in the story told by the witnesses for the prosecution, satisfies us as\u00a0 to the falsity of the story told by the defense, and we are confirmed in our conclusion, beyond a reasonable doubt, by the conduct of the widow throughout these\u00a0 proceedings,\u00a0 to\u00a0 which\u00a0 reference is made in the opinion of the trial judge.\u00a0\u00a0 We agree with the trial judge that the value of the testimony of this witness is practically destroyed by the convincing testimony\u00a0 of the prosecution tending to disclose her illicit relations with the defendant Leocadio\u00a0 Pajarillo before the crime\u00a0 was committed and the continuance of those relations after the death of her husband, taken together with her remarkable conduct in continuing\u00a0 to live quietly in the same province with the four\u00a0 men,\u00a0 who,\u00a0 she\u00a0 now\u00a0 alleges, murdered\u00a0 her husband before her eyes,\u00a0 and only pressing\u00a0 her complaint against them, first in 1906, just at the time when the charges against the defendants were originally filed in the court of the justice of the peace, and again, in the year 1909, just when this case was about to come on for trial.<br\/><br\/>Accepting, as\u00a0 we do, the material testimony for the prosecution, and rejecting, as we do, the\u00a0 material\u00a0 testimony offered by\u00a0 the defense, the judgment of the court below, convicting and sentencing these defendants must be affirmed, with the costs\u00a0 of this instance against the appellants, unless they are entitled to the benefit of the Amnesty Proclamation by the President of the United States,\u00a0 dated July 4, 1902. In the court below the protection afforded by the plea of amnesty was claimed on behalf of Leocadio Pajarillo; and in this court, counsel urges on behalf of all the appellants that even\u00a0 if the court be of opinion that\u00a0 the evidence sustains the contention of the prosecution that these defendants and appellants are the four individuals who fired upon and killed Ciriaco Occeno,\u00a0 deceased, as charged\u00a0 in the information, nevertheless, upon the facts developed by the Whole record, they are entitled to the benefits of the Amnesty Proclamation.<br\/><br\/>The declarative portion of the Amnesty Proclamation is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Now, therefore, be it known that I, Theodore Roosevelt, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the power and authority vested in\u00a0 me by\u00a0 the Constitution, do hereby proclaim and declare, without reservation or condition except as hereinafter provided,\u00a0 a full and complete pardon and amnesty to all persons in the Philippine Archipelago who have participated in the insurrections aforesaid or who have given aid and comfort to persons participating in said insurrections, for the offenses of treason or sedition and for all offenses political in their\u00a0 character committed in the course of such insurrections pursuant to orders issued by the civil or military insurrectionary authorities or which grew out of internal political feuds or dissensions between Filipinos and Spaniards or the Spanish authorities or which resulted from internal political feuds or dissensions among the Filipinos themselves during either of said insurrections.<br\/><br\/>\"Provided, however, That the pardon and amnesty hereby granted shall not include such persons committing crimes since May first, nineteen hundred and two, in any province of the Archipelago in which at the time civil government was established,\u00a0 nor shall it include such persons as\u00a0 have been heretofore finally\u00a0 convicted of the crimes of murder, rape, arson,\u00a0 or robbery by\u00a0 any military or civil tribunal organized under\u00a0 the authority of Spain\u00a0 or of the United States of America, but special application may\u00a0 be\u00a0 made to the proper authority for\u00a0 pardon\u00a0 by any person belonging to the exempted classes, and such clemency as is consistent\u00a0 with\u00a0 humanity and justice will be\u00a0 liberally\u00a0 extended.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In the case of the United States <i>vs.<\/i> Luzon\u00a0 (2 Phil. Rep., 380), this court laid\u00a0 down\u00a0 the following\u00a0 proposition\u00a0 (p. 381):<br\/><blockquote>\"To entitle a person to the benefits of this proclamation two things, at least, must concur: (1) He\u00a0 must have participated\u00a0 in the insurrections against Spain or the United States.\u00a0 (2) The crime with which he is charged must be political in its nature.\u00a0 Common crimes, such as murder and robbery,\u00a0 are not\u00a0 included\u00a0 within the\u00a0 amnesty unless they were\u00a0 committed\u00a0 under circumstances\u00a0 which clothe them with a political character.\u00a0\u00a0 This court has constantly adhered to this doctrine.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>While we are of opinion that the crime of murder committed\u00a0 by these appellants is not one of those included in the Amnesty Proclamation, we are not entirely agreed with the judge of the trial court as to the precise grounds upon which the claims of its benefits should be denied.<br\/><br\/>We base our denial of the\u00a0 benefits of the Amnesty Proclamation strictly upon the proposition that not only is there nothing in the record\u00a0 which would\u00a0 sustain a finding that the crime of murder of which these appellants are convicted was political\u00a0 in character, but that on\u00a0 the\u00a0 contrary\u00a0 the evidence strongly tends to disclose a motive for the slaying of the deceased wholly\u00a0 inconsistent with\u00a0 such a characterization of the\u00a0 offense.<br\/><br\/>The trial judge seems to have laid considerable stress on his finding of\u00a0 a failure\u00a0 of proof that at the time when\u00a0 the crime was committed\u00a0 these\u00a0 appellants were\u00a0 participating in an insurrection or in a seditious uprising jagainst Spain or the United States.\u00a0\u00a0 He was\u00a0 of opinion that the movement headed by Leocadio\u00a0 Pajarillo\u00a0 which resulted\u00a0 in\u00a0 the overthrow of the local\u00a0 municipal officers on the day of\u00a0 the murder was\u00a0 directed rather against\u00a0 the government\u00a0 set up\u00a0 by the leaders\u00a0 of the insurrection than\u00a0 against\u00a0 the sovereignty of the\u00a0 United States, and that it had for its object merely\u00a0 his own\u00a0 material profit, selfish aggrandizement, and political advancement in the municipality where he resided.\u00a0\u00a0 From these premises the trial judge concluded that whatever political character the offenses committed on that occasion may have had, it did not bring\u00a0 them within the terms of the Amnesty Proclamation.<br\/><br\/>We\u00a0 think, however,\u00a0 that\u00a0 under the\u00a0 liberal\u00a0 construction which should be given that instrument, the offenses\u00a0 committed by Leocadio Pajarillo and his partisans, which\u00a0 were incident to their attempt to seize control of the municipal insurrectionary\u00a0 government, must fairly\u00a0 be held\u00a0 to\u00a0 have \"resulted from internal political feuds or dissensions among the Filipinos themselves\" during the insurrection then pending, and that the participants in the overthrow of the\u00a0 local municipal insurrectionary governments were\u00a0 at the same time participants in one of the insurrectionary movements against the United States contemplated in the Proclamation. In applying\u00a0 the provisions of the Amnesty Proclamation we have never stopped to inquire to what degree particular leaders of the various insurrectionary movements may\u00a0 have been impelled by the lust of personal aggrandizement and political advancement, nor have we sought to\u00a0 discover the reasons for the \"internal political feuds or dissensions among the Filipinos themselves\" to which reference is made in the Proclamation,\u00a0 provided\u00a0 it\u00a0 affirmatively appears\u00a0 that such feuds or dissensions could fairly\u00a0 be\u00a0 characterized as political.\u00a0 We are of opinion, therefore, that all that was done by Leocadio Pajarillo and\u00a0 his\u00a0 partisans on the day of the murder,\u00a0 which under the most\u00a0 liberal\u00a0 construction of the evidence\u00a0 of\u00a0 record\u00a0 can be\u00a0 said to have been an incident to the movement to seize the local municipal, officials and set up a new municipal government, must fairly be held to be included within the provisions of the Amnesty Proclamation.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 question\u00a0 then presents itself, whether the shooting of Occeno was or was not an incident of,the political movement participated in by Leocadio Pajarillo and his partisans on the\u00a0 day the shooting took place.\u00a0 This question we think must be answered in the negative, and in this conclusion we are agreed with the trial judge who rested his denial of the plea of amnesty not only on the\u00a0 ground that the political movement led by Leocadio Pajarillo was not such a movement as was contemplated in\u00a0 the Amnesty Proclamation, but that the shooting of Occeiio had no political significance whatever, and was merely the outcome of a personal difference with the deceased.<br\/><br\/>Accepting as true\u00a0 all the evidence of record, including the testimony of the witnesses for the defense, which tends to disclose that, on the day of the murder, Leocadio Pajarillo was at the\u00a0 head\u00a0 of a\u00a0 movement looking to the capture of the local municipal officers and the seizure'of control of the local municipal government, and accepting as true his claim that at that time he was a\u00a0 member of the\u00a0 branch of the insurrectionary forces known as macheteros, and that he joined in the movement against the local officials because he had heard that the acting president of the town was contemplating a surrender to the American forces, we\u00a0 still do not think the evidence\u00a0 is sufficient to maintain a finding that the cold-blooded murder of Occeno\u00a0 was committed\u00a0 in furtherance of that movement.\u00a0\u00a0 None of the other officials were killed and it does not appear that any attempt was made to kill them.\u00a0 Even the president, against whom it is\u00a0 alleged the\u00a0 suspicion of disloyalty\u00a0 was especially\u00a0 directed, was merely\u00a0 captured, apparently for the purpose of bringing him before\u00a0 higher authority for discipline,\u00a0 or at least to hold him in detention until his captors had secured\u00a0 control of the town.\u00a0 Aside from the personal motive attributed, to Leocadio Pajarillo by the witnesses for the prosecution, no reason suggests itself or has been suggested for the adoption of extreme measures in the case of Occeno.\u00a0 Navarro, whose spldiers were placed at the disposition of Pajarillo on that occasion, testified that Pajarillo reported to him that Occeno had been shot while attempting to\u00a0 escape, thus indicating that no excuse could be found at that time for the deliberate shooting of the deceased.\u00a0 The shooting did not take place under the strain of excitement\u00a0 incident to the movement,\u00a0 or in the heat of an altercation arising out of the unusual incidents of the day.\u00a0 Occeno was shot unarmed at the cold, gray dawn of the day, in his own house, through his partially opened door, without being given an opportunity to recognize his assailants, much less to enter into a discussion with them, or to learn their object in attacking him.\u00a0 The attacking party did not contain any\u00a0 of the revolutionary soldiers who were operating under the orders of Leocadio Pajarillo, but consisted only of Pajarillo himself, his two brothers and\u00a0 his\u00a0 brother-in-law, and it is\u00a0 manifest that they had agreed upon his death before they sought him out at his home.\u00a0 The evidence strongly tends\u00a0 to disclose, if it does not conclusively establish, the fact that the leader of that party was the paramour of the\u00a0 wife of the\u00a0 victim of the tragedy.\u00a0 It is fair to assume that he had reason to fear the enmity of the man he had wronged on the\u00a0 discovery of his illicit relations with his wife.\u00a0 In any event the personal motive for the commission of the crime stands out strongly from the pages of the record, and nothing that is\u00a0 contained therein justifies the conclusion that it was induced by any demand of political necessity or expediency.<br\/><br\/>We are of\u00a0 opinion, therefore, that the defendants and appellants have not shown that the crime which they committed was political in character; that, while it is true that it was committed on the occasion of an internal dissension among Filipinos during the course of an insurrection, it did not result from such dissension, and that these defendants and appellants are not, therefore, entitled to the benefits of the President's Proclamation of Amnesty.<br\/><br\/>Ten days hereafter let judgment be entered affirming the judgment of the court below, with\u00a0 the costs of this appeal against the appellants, and ten days thereafter let the record be\u00a0 returned to the court\u00a0 wherein\u00a0 it\u00a0 originated.\u00a0\u00a0 It\u00a0 is so ordered.<br\/><br\/><i> Arellano, C.

and the rest\u00a0 was added by agreement of both parties\u00a0 the former\u00a0 was\u00a0 for a\u00a0 sum of P954, as shown\u00a0 in Exhibit\u00a0 A, and\u00a0 the latter was for the sum of P76.70, as itemized in his complaint.<\/p><p>Defendant refused\u00a0 to\u00a0 pay\u00a0 the amount\u00a0 asked,\u00a0 alleging in his reply that he had applied to the plaintiff to examine the boiler, and after examination plaintiff had agreed with him to put the boiler in good condition for the sum of P950.<\/p><p>The Court of First Instance of the city of Manila found: (1) That the work to be done on\u00a0 the\u00a0 boiler was agreed upon in the estimate, Exhibit A, and that its value amounts to P954;\u00a0 (2) That later additional work was done in connecting the boiler with a\u00a0 washing-machine of the Manila Steam Laundry, to the value of P65, which, added to the foregoing P954, makes a total of P1,019; (3) That when the boiler had been connected with the machine and examined by the boiler inspector under\u00a0 the supervision of the city engineer of Manila, in conformity with ordinances in force, the latter refused to issue the permit necessary for its operation, because the boiler was not in proper condition, not being able to withstand a pressure of 90 pounds, making necessary the repairs\u00a0 indicated by\u00a0 the boiler inspector for its safe operation.\u00a0 The city engineer added that the lower\u00a0 back plate required a patch and this patch could not be put in place because of the peculiar position of the plate.<\/p><p>But the court did not\u00a0 find:\u00a0 (1) That it was agreed between plaintiff\u00a0 and defendant that the boiler and\u00a0 machine should withstand a pressure of 90 pounds; (2) that it was agreed between plaintiff and defendant\u00a0 that the boiler and machine would be subjected to inspection; (3) that, even though this were taken for granted,\u00a0 it was agreed between plaintiff and defendant that, without the approval of the city engineer,\u00a0 the work\u00a0 of the\u00a0 plaintiff would not\u00a0 be accepted, nor its value paid;\u00a0 (4) that the plaintiff did not perform all the work agreed upon in the said estimate, as well as the additional work necessary\u00a0 for\u00a0 connecting it with the machine;\u00a0 (5) that the work which, according to the city engineer,\u00a0 the plaintiff did not perform or left undone, as well as the additional work\u00a0 for connecting the boiler with the machine, would be included in the agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant according to the estimate, Exhibit A.<\/p><p>From the foregoing finding of facts proven\u00a0 and not proven, the court reaches the following conclusions:<\/p><ol><li>That the plaintiff on his part fulfilled the contract and performed all the work entrusted\u00a0 to him by the defendant, as well as the additional work necessary for the operation of the machine.<br\/><\/li>\u00a0 <li>That as it was not agreed between the\u00a0 plaintiff and the defendant that the approval of the city engineer would be a necessary condition to payment for the work; and that as\u00a0 it was not\u00a0 proven that the defects noted\u00a0 by the city engineer were due to the plaintiff's failure to do the work agreed upon between him and the defendant in the estimate, Exhibit A, it is clear that the plaintiff can not be held responsible for the defects in the\u00a0 boiler and machine that were noted by the city engineer,\u00a0 nor for the damages\u00a0 incurred by the defendant from the failure of the machine to operate at the proper time: damages for which the defendant in\u00a0 turn makes a counterclaim.<\/li><\/ol><p>For\u00a0 all these reasons the court\u00a0 sentences the defendant to pay to the plaintiff P1,019, with legal interest at 6 per rent a year on said sum\u00a0 from July 12, 1909,\u00a0 the date of filing the\u00a0 complaint, until\u00a0 its\u00a0 complete\u00a0 liquidation, and to pay\u00a0\u00a0 the costs; and dismisses the defendant's counterclaim against the plaintiff.<\/p><p>Defendant appealed, because of the court's holding Exhibit A to be a contract between parties; for\u00a0 holding that plaintiff had performed the work according to the contract; and for having granted the plaintiff the sum of money he sues\u00a0 for on account of work the defendant had entrusted to him as a skilled mechanic or engineer, when this amount of money and the labor employed on the work\u00a0 have not been useful or profitable to the defendant, for whom, rather, the value of the boiler has been lessened.<\/p><p>It\u00a0 appears from the trial:<\/p><p>1.\u00a0 That the\u00a0 defendant testified as follows:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"I\u00a0 bought this boiler at second-hand, knowing nothing about what\u00a0 condition\u00a0 it was in except what could be seen from the outside.\u00a0\u00a0 Wishing to put it in\u00a0 good condition for operating the machinery of the new laundry,\u00a0 I asked for bids from various mechanics of the city, as to what the repairs would cost for putting the boiler in usable condition and fit for operation.\u00a0\u00a0 Among the mechanics I\u00a0 remember Messrs. Taylor, McChesney, Manuel Earnshaw, and I think also the San\u00a0 Nicholas Iron Works.\u00a0\u00a0 I think I received bids or\u00a0 estimates\u00a0 from\u00a0 all\u00a0 of them.\u00a0\u00a0 I\u00a0 contracted\u00a0 with Mr. Taylor, whose agent examined the boiler and prepared a list of the repairs to be made for putting the boiler in usable condition.\u00a0 He said\u00a0 that he could make these repairs for nine hundred and fifty-four pesos.\u00a0\u00a0 As this was the lowest bid, I immediately closed the deal.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Sten. notes, 24, 25.)<\/p><p>The contract, therefore, consisted \"in the plaintiff's making repairs to the boiler to put it <em>in usable condition<\/em>\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>D. M. McChesney, one of the above-mentioned mechanics, was called as a\u00a0 witness for the defendant, and testified: That the\u00a0 defendant had in fact applied to him; that he had made an\u00a0 estimate, but it had not been accepted, perhaps because it was too high;\u00a0 that a condition of his contract was that \"the boiler should be put\u00a0 in very good\u00a0 condition, so that it\u00a0 would be approved by the inspector.\"\u00a0\u00a0 \"It would be necessary,\" so he says, \"according to the <em>conditions <\/em>in our\u00a0 regulations.\"\u00a0 [Sten.\u00a0 notes,\u00a0 17.]\u00a0 He then confirms the defendant's statement that the\u00a0 inspector, accompanied by the manager of the\u00a0 laundry, tested the boiler after its installation by the\u00a0 plaintiff (it does not appear that\u00a0 the latter was present); and\u00a0 replies\u00a0 to the following cross-questions :<\/p><blockquote><p>\"Q. Did you examine\u00a0 the boiler and the machinery after it had been installed there by Mr. Taylor? - A.\u00a0 Yes,\u00a0 sir; I was the first to\u00a0 fill the boiler and put it under pressure.<\/p><p>\"Q. Did you notice the various repairs made by\u00a0 Mr. Taylor?- A.\u00a0 I\u00a0 was\u00a0 not very familiar\u00a0 with\u00a0 what\u00a0 Mr. Taylor had done to the boiler, only with respect to the pipes and they were in\u00a0 good condition.<\/p><p>\"Q. Did you operate the machine? - A. Yes, sir.<\/p><p>\"Q. How did it work ? - A.\u00a0 The machinery seemed to run well.<\/p><p>\"Q. Do you remember\u00a0 what pressure there was in the boiler? - A. Yes, sir; I remember the pressure I put on the boiler, but the inspector would have had me arrested if I had continued with the pressure I had put on.<\/p><p>\"Q. What pressure did\u00a0 you put on the boiler? - A. Between ninety and a hundred pounds.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Sten. notes, 19, 20.)<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The defendant again\u00a0 testifies, saying that the\u00a0 place where the\u00a0 boiler and machinery were installed was indicated by the manager of the Manila Steam Laundry.<\/p><blockquote><p>\"Q. By whose authority did\u00a0 Mr. McChesney\u00a0 test the machinery? - A. They made a kind of test of the machinery of the laundry without my knowledge.<\/p><p>\"Q. To whom do you refer? - A. To Mr. McChesney and the manager of the laundry.\"\u00a0 (Sten.\u00a0 notes, 45.)<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The witness McChesney was further cross-examined:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"Q. Do you know whether the boiler inspector examined this boiler <em>before<\/em> these repairs were made? - A.\u00a0 Only from what the inspector told me.<\/p><p>\"Q. Did\u00a0 the\u00a0 inspector indicate to you the repairs that had to be made so that they could afterwards be approved? -\u00a0 A.\u00a0 Yes, sir; he indicated\u00a0 what had to be repaired in the boiler.<\/p><p>\"Q. And did you make\u00a0 your\u00a0 calculation\u00a0 on\u00a0 what was indicated by the inspector? - A.\u00a0 No, sir; the calculation I made was before talking with the inspector.<\/p><p>\"Q. Before making your bid, didn't you know what the inspector would require? - A.\u00a0 No, sir.\"\u00a0 (Sten. notes, 21.)<\/p><\/blockquote><p>John\u00a0 Karsten,\u00a0 engineer, witness for\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiff, and employed by the latter on\u00a0 that contract, testifies regarding the facts entered in the complaint: that he had submitted the estimate, Exhibit A;\u00a0 that the defendant asked him what pressure the boiler would have and he told him that in his opinion\u00a0 it would have a\u00a0 pressure of about\u00a0 sixty pounds, and the\u00a0 boiler was repaired\u00a0 in accordance with that estimate; that he tested the boiler under hydraulic; and steam pressure and everything was in good condition.<\/p><p>From the foregoing evidence it appears: That for the proposed contract with McChesney, the latter talked with the boiler inspector, who indicated to him the repairs that had to be made to the boiler so that its installation would be approved; while for the proposed contract with Taylor, which was\u00a0 subsequent to McChesney's,\u00a0 there was not the slightest connection with said inspector.<\/p><p>Now what was the gist\u00a0 of the contract?\u00a0 This the defendant fixes exactly in several\u00a0 passages in his evidence:<\/p><p>\"Repairs\u00a0 necessary\u00a0 to put the boiler in\u00a0 usable condition.(Page 24.)<\/p><p>\"List\u00a0 of\u00a0 repairs he (Taylor) has\u00a0 to make\u00a0 to put the boiler in usable condition.\u00a0 (Page 25.)<\/p><p>\"Karsten said that\u00a0 he would have the boiler in usable condition before the\u00a0 arrival of the\u00a0 September\u00a0 transport. (Page 25.)<\/p><p>\"They informed me that the boiler was finished and ready for use,\u00a0 two days before\u00a0 the arrival\u00a0 of the\u00a0 transport. (Page 25.)<\/p><p>\"He (Taylor)\u00a0 submitted a statement of the repairs he said were necessary to put the boiler in usable condition. (Page 44.)<\/p><p>\"*\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 and if those were the repairs necessary to put the boiler in\u00a0 usable condition, I told him\u00a0 (Karsten) that I would inform him afterwards, but I did not at the time accept his proposition.\u00a0\u00a0 (Page 44.)<\/p><blockquote><p>\"I applied to Taylor later.\u00a0\u00a0 The purpose of the conversation with\u00a0 him, acceptance of his bid for repairs.\"\u00a0 (Page 44.) <\/p><\/blockquote><p>Nevertheless, on page 5 of his brief the appellant says:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"The plaintiff in the presence of the\u00a0 city engineer, admitted that the contract was to place the boiler in first-class condition to be\u00a0 used in the laundry, but denied that he agreed that it would\u00a0 pass inspection.\u00a0 (Page\u00a0 57.)\u00a0 But had it been placed even in a usable condition,\u00a0 not necessarily first-class, his contract would have been performed.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>On\u00a0 page\u00a0 56 appears\u00a0 a question directed to the\u00a0 city engineer, Mr. Wylie, to this effect:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"In order to refresh your memory,\u00a0 I would like to ask you if Mr. Pierce asked Mr. Taylor, 'If you\u00a0 agreed to put the boiler in first-class condition, wasn't it\u00a0 up to you to do so?' and Mr. Taylor answered, 'Yes, sir; but I\u00a0 didn't guarantee that it\u00a0 would\u00a0 pass inspection;' and\u00a0 you\u00a0 [the witness]\u00a0 replied that if the boiler had been put in\u00a0 first-class condition\u00a0 it would have been approved by the inspector.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>And on page 57 appears what Mr. Wylie really said:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"Mr. Pierce claimed that Mr. Taylor\u00a0 had contracted with him to sell or perhaps to repair a boiler and the conditions of this contract were that it would be put in first-class condition,\u00a0 Mr. Taylor stated that the\u00a0 conditions were not that the boiler be approved\u00a0 by the boiler inspector; while Mr. Pierce regarded this as the standard of its being put in first-class condition; and when these two points arose in the discussion, I\u00a0 told him that if he had put the\u00a0 boiler in first-class condition, it Would necessarily have received the approval of the boiler inspector.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Considerably\u00a0 previous\u00a0 to\u00a0 the foregoing, there\u00a0 appears in the record,\u00a0 on page 28, the following regarding what Mr. Pierce really said:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"Mr. Taylor talked to me again about this matter in my office.\u00a0 I again told him, in the presence of Mr. Wylie, that he agreed to put the boiler in <em>usable\u00a0 condition,<\/em> and that it was his duty to do so.\u00a0 Mr. Taylor answered yes, but that it had\u00a0 not been agreed that said boiler would receive Mr. Wylie's approval on inspection.\u00a0 I answered him that if it had been\u00a0 in\u00a0 good\u00a0 condition\u00a0 it\u00a0 would have passed inspection.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Taylor\u00a0 and McChesney testify that they never said that they would put the boiler in first-class condition; tfte work done was to put the boiler in a condition to withstand a pressure of 60 pounds.<\/p><p>If, according to the appellant, the contract would have been\u00a0 fulfilled by putting\u00a0 the\u00a0 boiler in usable\u00a0 condition, without need for first-class work, then it has been fulfilled, especially as the boiler has been put in a condition to be used, in usable condition, in accordance with the agreement in the contract.\u00a0 The engineer McChesney, witness for the appellant, certifies that the machinery worked well,\u00a0 that it easily withstood a pressure of sixty pounds, for which the repairs made on that boiler were intended.\u00a0 If it was required that the boiler withstand\u00a0 greater pressure,\u00a0 that should have been expressly stipulated in the contract.\u00a0 There is no reason or indication that this condition could or ought to be understood by\u00a0 implication in a contract the terms whereof are merely those of the boiler's being used or in usable condition.<\/p><p>When the appellant received the appellee's estimate, Exhibit A,\u00a0 he had other estimates submitted by\u00a0 other mechanics, among\u00a0 these McChesney's, and\u00a0 he\u00a0 withheld his reply, promising to say later whether he accepted it or not. He was able to make\u00a0 comparisons, and he expressly stated that \"if those were the repairs\u00a0 necessary for putting the boiler in usable condition he would inform him later,\" and afterwards he had to state his acceptance to the appellee. So it is logical to infer that he would do so knowingly and would not confide\u00a0 wholly in\u00a0 the skill of\u00a0 the\u00a0 other party to the contract.<\/p><p>Work\u00a0 superior to\u00a0 a usable condition, and\u00a0 a first-class condition that presupposes inferior classes, are relative terms which are not\u00a0 enforcible\u00a0 in\u00a0 contracts for work to be done,\u00a0 unless\u00a0 expressly\u00a0 stipulated.\u00a0 Greater\u00a0 power of resistance than that possessed by the thing made and the highest condition of perfection to which a piece of work can be raised, as first-class of its kind, are not terms that must be understood in\u00a0 a contract\u00a0 for work to\u00a0 be done. They must\u00a0 be expressly required in\u00a0 the contract in order to be enforcible.\u00a0\u00a0 Otherwise, it could happen that a perfect piece of work of the best kind, for which the money promised would not be adequate, might be required for a medium or minimum price.<\/p><p>The findings in the judgment appealed from clearly demonstrate that it\u00a0 was not\u00a0 a condition of the contract that the work had to be first class, nor that it was a condition of the contract that acceptance of the work had to depend upon the approval of a third party.\u00a0\u00a0 With reference to the preliminaries of the contract,\u00a0 the\u00a0 difference between McChesney's and Taylor's proposals is quite clear:\u00a0 the former's contained that condition of the approval of the boiler inspector; the latter's\u00a0 made not the slightest mention of this approval, until\u00a0 the work was done.\u00a0 It\u00a0 can not\u00a0 be uniformly enforced\u00a0 in\u00a0 both instances, for the\u00a0 reason\u00a0 that it was imposed in one and\u00a0 left out of the other.<\/p><p>As for\u00a0 the law, article\u00a0 1598, paragraph 2, of the Civil Code,\u00a0\u00a0 furnishes\u00a0 the principle for deciding\u00a0 the present question.\u00a0 \"If the person\u00a0 who has\u00a0 to approve the work is a third person\u00a0 that is, if it were so agreed his decision shall be final.\"\u00a0\u00a0 Then\u00a0 if\u00a0 it was not agreed that a third person had to approve the work, no third person may decide upon the fulfillment\u00a0 of\u00a0 the contract.<\/p><p>The principles\u00a0 of law followed\u00a0 by the lower court being correct, the\u00a0 judgment appealed from is affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.<\/p><p><em>Torres, Mapa,<\/em> and<em> Johnson, JJ.<\/em>, concur.<\/p><\/div>",

And no attempt is made, by affidavits\u00a0 or otherwise, to show that the date\u00a0 which appears on the face of the judgment was not the true date on which it was rendered.<br\/><br\/>Similar reasoning disposes of counsel's attempt, by reference\u00a0 to this discrepancy in\u00a0 dates, to impeach the truth and\u00a0 accuracy of the solemn recital in the judgment that the defendant, prior\u00a0 to\u00a0 the time\u00a0 when it was rendered,\u00a0 was duly arraigned and\u00a0 pleaded to the\u00a0 information.\u00a0 In the absence of\u00a0 all proof to the contrary,\u00a0 we\u00a0 must conclude, either that the trial was had and the judgment entered on the 13th day of March, 1910, in which case the date which appears on\u00a0 the judgment is a\u00a0 clerical error of the judge, but an error without prejudice,\u00a0 as we have already said; or that the\u00a0 trial was had, the\u00a0 plea entered, and the judgment rendered on\u00a0 the\u00a0 3d day of March,\u00a0 1910, in which case the date which appears in the extract from the minutes is a clerical\u00a0 error of the clerk of the court, which, of course, in no wise prejudices the appellant, and is no cause for reversal.\u00a0 The .trial judge\u00a0 having\u00a0 solemnly declared\u00a0 in his judgment that the accused was duly arraigned, pleaded to the charge, and thereupon his judgment was rendered; and the clerk's\u00a0 minutes clearly setting\u00a0 out that the accused was duly arraigned, pleaded to the charge,\u00a0 and that thereupon judgment was entered, it is absurd to contend that we would be justified in holding\u00a0 both these solemn recitals of fact to be false, merely because of a discrepancy in the dates of the record of the proceedings wherein they\u00a0 are set out, a discrepancy which may be readily accounted for by the accidental insertion of a 3 instead of a 13, or a 13 instead\u00a0 of a 3, in one or the other\u00a0 of\u00a0 the instruments\u00a0 in which the account of the proceedings is set forth.<br\/><br\/>As to\u00a0 counsel's\u00a0 attempt\u00a0 to impeach\u00a0 the correctness of the statement in the opinion of the trial judge wherein he sets forth that the accused declared himself guilty\u00a0 of the crime of which he was charged, by a reference to the statement in the minutes of the clerk which\u00a0 makes it appear that on arraignment, the accused said\u00a0 that he considered himself guilty, we think it is sufficient to say that we find no\u00a0 substantial\u00a0 difference between the\u00a0 statements of fact which both\u00a0 clearly\u00a0 set forth, to\u00a0 wit,\u00a0 that on arraignment the accused\u00a0 pleaded \"guilty.\"\u00a0 The essence of the plea of \"guilty\" in a criminal trial, is that the accused, on arraignment, admits his guilt,\u00a0 freely, voluntarily, and with a full knowledge of the consequences and the meaning of his act. We do not think that the form\u00a0 of this admission is of vital importance,\u00a0 provided the admission of guilt is\u00a0 clear, definite, and unconditioned.\u00a0 Upon the solemn arraignment of the\u00a0 accused in the course of criminal proceedings against him, when he is\u00a0 asked whether he is guilty or not guilty of the offense charged in\u00a0 the complaint or information, the answers\u00a0 \"Guilty;\"\u00a0 \"I am\u00a0 guilty;\"\u00a0 \"I\u00a0 consider myself guilty;\" and \"I declare myself guilty;\" are all, under the circumstances, substantially similar and of like effect.\u00a0\u00a0 It is the fact that the accused upon arraignment admits his guilt of the offense charged in the complaint or information which is important, not the form\u00a0 of the language\u00a0 in which he does it.<br\/><br\/>We may observe, however, in this connection, that in our opinion, the form used by the trial judge in setting out the fact that a plea of \"Guilty\" was entered, is distinctly preferable to the form used by the clerk in his minutes; and it would seem that\u00a0 under the practice and usage introduced into these\u00a0 Islands by the publication of General Orders, No. 58, the better form in which the plea should be cast is the literal equivalent\u00a0 in the language\u00a0 or dialect of the\u00a0 accused of the words \"I am guilty\" or \"I\u00a0 declare myself guilty.\" The judgment of conviction and the sentence imposed upon the appellant in the court below should be affirmed,\u00a0 with the costs of this instance against him.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.\u00a0 J., Mapa, Moreland, <\/i>and <i>Trent, JJ.,<\/i>\u00a0 concur.<br\/><\/div>",

and although the duties fixed in this tariff were illegally exacted\u00a0 at that time, that is, after the exchange of the treaty of peace, such illegality was not the result of an inherent want of power in the United States to have authorized their imposition, but simply arose from\u00a0 the failure to delegate to the public official the authority essential to give immediate validity to his acts in enforcing the\u00a0 payment of the\u00a0 said duties; and since what is done by the agent without express power from the beginning\u00a0 on the part of the principal, may subsequently by the latter be confirmed by\u00a0 his\u00a0 ratifying his agent's action,\u00a0 hence Congress, by its said Act of June 30, 1906, confirmed, ratified, and gave such duties,\u00a0 levied and\u00a0 collected,\u00a0 legal subsistence\u00a0 in giving legal existence\u00a0 to\u00a0 the customs tariff, as though\u00a0 it had been passed by Congress itself, and\u00a0 the fallacy\u2014the court adds\u2014\"becomes yet more obvious when it is observed\u00a0 that the\u00a0 contention can\u00a0 not even be formulated without misstating the nature of the Act of\u00a0 Congress;

If, since this last date, it was unduly applied\u00a0 and, as a result thereof, there were<em> illegal collections<\/em> of the duties levied from then to\u00a0 November 15, 1901, when the Act of the Philippine Commission went into effect, and even also, it may be granted, until March 8, 1902, when the Act of Congress began to be operative, it was not,\u00a0 as the Supreme Court\u00a0 of the United States\u00a0 has\u00a0 already held, for an original want of power in\u00a0 the United\u00a0 States in\u00a0 whose name such duties were exacted, but was merely through an overreaching of power on the part of the agent\u2014a defect which, if it really vitiated those\u00a0 collections,\u00a0 certainly was adoptable\u00a0 and was\u00a0 adopted by the general law of agency which authorizes the constituent or principal to ratify and make as of his own the act of the delegate or agent as if he himself, instead of the latter, had performed it, \"as if such collection,\" the\u00a0 words of the Act, \"had\u00a0 been specifically authorized and directed,\" by a <em>prior<\/em> Act of Congress.<\/p><p>In the second place: The\u00a0 intention and\u00a0 will of the legislator\u00a0 being so clear, so explicit,\u00a0 to approve, confirm, and ratify as by an act of his own prior to April 11,\u00a0 1899, and even also to\u00a0 July 12, 1898\u00a0 (the\u00a0 date\u00a0 of the order of the President), the acts of the latter\u00a0 and\u00a0 of the officials\u00a0 of the Government of these Islands, with respect to \"the collection of all the said duties prior to March 8, 1902,\" and also with regard\u00a0 to\u00a0 \"the import\u00a0 and export\u00a0 duties\u00a0 levied by\u00a0 the authorities of the United States or of the provisional military government of the same in the Philippine Islands prior to March 8,\u00a0 1902\"\u00a0 two subjects that\u00a0 are the\u00a0 purpose of the said Act, it being an axiom of law, that the\u00a0 ratification is equivalent to a mandate (<em>ratikabitio sequiparatur mandato<\/em>), the conclusion can not be avoided that, by the legislator's will, the tariff duties demandable during the period mentioned in the complaint, are so, not by a null and void order of the\u00a0 President, but by an Act of Congress.\u00a0\u00a0 Such, and no other, is for the courts the status, of the<em> established<\/em> law in this matter, be whatever it may, in abstract law, the legality of the legislative act\u00a0 concerned, for there\u00a0 is no question pending before\u00a0 us with respect to its constitutionality,\u00a0 \"We do not treat of the question in this brief,\" says the appellant, \"as we do not consider it necessary to do so.\" (Brief,\u00a0 p. 15.)<\/p><p>In the third place: If, as the said Act provides, \"the tariff duties both import and\u00a0 export<em> imposed<\/em> by the\u00a0 authorities of the United States or of the provisional military government thereof in the Philippine Islands prior to March 8, 1902,\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 upon <em>all<\/em> goods,\u00a0 wares, and merchandise imported into said Islands from the United States\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 * are\u00a0 hereby legalized\u00a0 and\u00a0 ratified\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *;\"\u00a0 if the\u00a0 refined petroleum concerned in the complaint, was one of the articles imported into these Islands from the United States prior to March\u00a0 8, 1902; if the import duty\u00a0 imposed upon it by section 30 of the tariff established by authority of the United\u00a0 States\u00a0 (the President), was 6.318 pesos Mexican currency for\u00a0 each 100 kilograms; if the total\u00a0 amount of this duty, aggregating, according to the facts set forth, the sum specified in the complaint, has been owing since\u00a0 October 28, 1901; if the action for its collection\u00a0 has arisen, and has not\u00a0 prescribed in accordance with section 206 of Act No. 355, by reason of the\u00a0 fraud committed and which has justly given ground for the levying of duty\u00a0 then why should the customs officials and the prosecuting officers of the Government remain inactive and not comply with their duty to exact, collect or demand the payment of such duties? And how can the courts, in view of an explicit\u00a0 law, appraised duties, an importation effected and an action arisen and not\u00a0 prescribed, fail\u00a0 to grant what\u00a0 is asked in a complaint based on such grounds?<\/p><p>In the fourth place: It is to beg the question to affirm that an\u00a0 attempt is now being made again to collect the duties on\u00a0 certain merchandise which already, several years ago, was entered free of duty because of the absolute lack of any law that may\u00a0 have validly\u00a0 imposed them.\u00a0\u00a0 Neither was there a lack of such a law, nor did the goods in\u00a0 question enter absolutely free of duty, but\u00a0 their importation was merely allowed conditionally,\u00a0 upon the\u00a0 declaration that they fell under an exemption, in accordance with\u00a0 the free entry clause contained in the\u00a0 same law, the existence of which is now denied.\u00a0 Had\u00a0 not the privilege of exemption from\u00a0 duty granted by the law been utilized,\u00a0 the duties now demanded would have been collected in July, 1901, and the most that could have happened is that the appellant would have found itself in the same situation as that of\u00a0 Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., and Heinszen &amp; Co., sharing with both these firms\u00a0 the uncertain\u00a0 results that might be attained by assailing the order of July 12, 1898; but now\u00a0 the appellant's situation\u00a0 is parallel to that of those two\u00a0 firms\u00a0 only\u00a0 in respect to the fact of the importation of merchandise during the much discussed\u00a0 period,\u00a0 and differs therefrom in that the two\u00a0 companies above cited paid under\u00a0 protest, being resolved\u00a0 to maintain a theory of law, while the appellant was thoroughly convinced of the validity of the tariff and chose\u00a0 to avail itself of a privilege\u00a0 of\u00a0 exemption therein provided for, which, according to an admitted fact of the complaint, it abused by the commission of fraud.<\/p><p>This court would willingly overlook the fact enunciated in the last sentence just above expressed, and accept the third\u00a0 proposition\u00a0 stated by the appellant in\u00a0 its brief; but our desire is strongly opposed by section 91 of the Code of Civil Procedure and the agreement of the parties themselves above transcribed,\u00a0 according to\u00a0 which agreement \"the allegations of the complaint have been admitted by the defendant,\" one of them, to wit, the 13th, being that:<\/p><p>\"The said 19,321 cases of petroleum were withdrawn\u00a0 by the defendant company through deceit and fraud and with the definite purpose of defrauding the Government of the Philippine Islands of the customs duties owing to the same.\" (B.\u00a0 of E., p.\u00a0 5,)<\/p><p>In\u00a0 the\u00a0 fifth\u00a0 place: The\u00a0 appellant's <em>a pari<\/em>\u00a0 argument is not,\u00a0 in this case, conclusive; it would be\u00a0 so, had an exact parity been established; for example, were it said that the constituent or principal had conferred power upon his agent in the United States, up to a certain period of time; that the agent\u00a0 had\u00a0 to\u00a0 confer the said power\u00a0 upon another in the Philippines for the purpose of the latter's exercising the same until the time fixed; that at a time considerably beyond that fixed, the substitute in the Philippines continued\u00a0 to exercise such power, let us say, for instance by collecting the rentals from several of the\u00a0 principal's tenants; that one of the latter alleged an exemption from payment, with very\u00a0 apparent\u00a0 proof that convinced the\u00a0 substitute\u00a0 who, therefore, desisted from requiring payment; that another tenant paid under protest and accordingly brought suit and obtained an acquittance from the payment, for the reason that it had been demanded of him\u00a0 without power, when the power had already lapsed; that thereupon the principal, having learned of this case, ratified the power and the acts of the substitute; that another\u00a0 of\u00a0 the tenants, upon whom a demand\u00a0 to pay was made in the same manner as upon the previous one, also alleged the lapse of the power and the illegality of the requirement of the substitute, but,\u00a0 as the principal had already\u00a0 declared his intention to ratify the acts and the power of the substitute, the tenant did not succeed in obtaining a release\u00a0 from the payment; that,\u00a0 upon the discovery by the substitute that the\u00a0 first\u00a0 of the said tenants had falsely made it appear that such tenant had a cause for exemption from payment, suit was brought against the latter.\u00a0 If such first\u00a0 tenant could be, through his fraud or without fraud whatever, in a better situation than the third one and should be released from the payment of the rental which was not collected from him for a false reason,\u00a0 then the argument would be, by parity,\u00a0 conclusive that neither may the appellant be\u00a0 required to make the payment which, in 1901, would have been demanded of it, had it not brought forward that free entry privilege which afterwards turned out to be a false reason for exemption.<\/p><p>Neither could this first tenant above referred to, nor can the appellant, in\u00a0 our\u00a0 opinion, say that they knew how to elude, in one way or\u00a0 another, at\u00a0 a given time, a payment which they deemed devoid of good grounds, as was stated with reference to the second tenant mentioned in the example, and that the judgment rendered with respect to the third\u00a0 tenant could not warrant that, at some subsequent time, action might again be taken in the matter of the payment\u00a0 previously eluded, on the grounds that the non-payment\u00a0 was an acquired right and the ratification made by the principal could not, without its being given a retroactive effect, have any bearing except on future acts and not on those\u00a0 already past.<\/p><p>The admission, free of duty, of the\u00a0 appellant's petroleum, could\u00a0 not constitute an acquired right, since this exception was not\u00a0 absolute, but conditional; the exemption was\u00a0 not the result of a right of its own, but simply one granted as a favor to a third party and of which, as the\u00a0 Government averred and the appellant admitted,\u00a0 it made an improper use; therefore this exemption can not be considered,\u00a0 not even by the lapse of time, as\u00a0 a mode of\u00a0 extinguishing an obligation.<\/p><p>The obligation to pay, therefore, still exists.<\/p><p>By reason of the foregoing, the judgment appealed from is affirmed, and the costs are assessed against the appellant.

There are many reasons which lead to this conclusion.<\/p><p>The Act in question makes no mention of the military order issued by the President under which said duties were exacted.\u00a0 It does not say that the dead order is revived and put in force retroactively.\u00a0 It merely confirms and ratifies all that had already been done in connection with the imposition and collection of customs duties.\u00a0 Although we know that\u00a0 the\u00a0 Act refers to duties which\u00a0 were imposed and collected\u00a0 in accordance with\u00a0 the\u00a0 military\u00a0 order\u00a0 already quoted, we do not, however, gather this information from the terms of the Act itself but from the history of the case; and as Congress did not intend to pass a retroactive law but, rather, one to ratify exactions and collections<em> already made,<\/em> the Act contained only what was absolutely necessary to\u00a0 accomplish that\u00a0 purpose.<\/p><p>If\u00a0 the Act in\u00a0 question had attempted to revive retro-actively the military order,\u00a0 Congress would have been met with\u00a0 the\u00a0 very\u00a0 serious\u00a0 question whether\u00a0 such an attempt would not have been\u00a0 in\u00a0 violation\u00a0 of the\u00a0 Constitution.\u00a0\u00a0 I shall\u00a0 not,\u00a0 however,\u00a0 undertake to\u00a0 discuss\u00a0 this question. From the view I take of this case it is unnecessary to do so. I content myself with calling attention to the fact that it is to be presumed that Congress, in enacting the law in question, had in mind the provisions of the Constitution to which I have referred, and that, not desiring to pass\u00a0 any legislation of doubtful validity, it confined itself to confirming and ratifying what had already been done during the time that collections were made under the President's military order.<\/p><p>At the\u00a0 time the ratification Act was\u00a0 passed demands were being made upon the Government of the United States for the return of large sums of money for duties which had been illegally levied and collected under said military order, and the Government found that, unless a ratification act were\u00a0 passed, it would be obliged to refund millions which had been so collected at the port of Manila and elsewhere in the Philippine Islands.\u00a0 The decisions above cited made this obligation to refund very evident.\u00a0 Under those decisions it is undoubted that the Government would have been compelled to return many millions of dollars Collected on importations into the Philippine Islands from the United States during the years intervening between the ratification of the treaty of Paris and\u00a0 the 15th of November, 1901, the date on which a valid tariff law duly authorized by Congress for the imposition of such\u00a0 customs duties became\u00a0 effective. These decisions swept the whole field, leaving no vantage ground from which the Government could resist the demands for the return of the sums thus illegally drawn from the commerce of the\u00a0 two countries.<\/p><p>One of the most important of the rules for the interpretation of a statute is to ascertain what evil such statute was intended to remedy and the method adopted to remedy it. In this case it is clear that\u00a0 the evil which the Government sought to escape was the return of the vast sum of money which had been mistakenly collected by its officials.\u00a0 The real purpose of the Act, then, was not to collect duties which had not been levied or imposed at the time of the entry of the merchandise, or\u00a0 to impose new duties;\u00a0 but, rather, to avert the\u00a0 calamity\u00a0 of returning the\u00a0 enormous\u00a0 amounts already collected, something which would have embarrassed the public treasury and given cause for charging the government\u00a0 with maladministration in the customs affairs of the Philippine Islands.\u00a0 All that was necessary, then, in order to retain the money already collected, was a bare ratification.<\/p><p>If Congress had intended to levy duties on merchandise previously imported, it would have provided some method whereby such retroactive imposition and collection could have\u00a0 been made and enforced.\u00a0\u00a0 It\u00a0 would not seem\u00a0 that Congress intended to impose duties on merchandise which had been imported\u00a0 free\u00a0 during the period in question, thereby compelling the Government, in the ports\u00a0 of\u00a0 the Philippine Islands, as well as in those of the United States, to institute judicial\u00a0 proceedings for the recovery of said duties on the innumerable shipments of goods, wares, and merchandise\u00a0 passing between\u00a0 the two\u00a0 countries.\u00a0 Such would be the\u00a0 result\u00a0 if the\u00a0 ratification\u00a0 had greater reach than I attribute to it.<\/p><p>It is apparent, therefore,\u00a0 that the intention\u00a0 of Congress was to maintain, rather than disturb, the<em> statu quo;<\/em> that is to say, to leave\u00a0 things as<em> they were,<\/em> ratifying what had already been done, instead of undoing what had previously been done, and thereby opening an\u00a0 endless series of litigation of which\u00a0 that at bar is one.<\/p><p>It should not be forgotten that\u00a0 this is a case in which acts performed by an agent in the name of his principal, without\u00a0 authority, are\u00a0 subsequently\u00a0 ratified.\u00a0 An agent, believing himself sufficiently authorized to delegate to another the power to perform certain acts, executes a power of attorney to a third person to buy, sell, mortgage, etc. property, thereby\u00a0 greatly exceeding\u00a0 his powers.\u00a0 Subsequently\u00a0 the\u00a0 principal,\u00a0 upon\u00a0 discovering what\u00a0 had been done in\u00a0 his name without authority, elects to ratify such acts, and accordingly executes a document in which he says: \"I hereby ratify\u00a0 and confirm all things done\u00a0 by so and so (the third person) in my name, all acts performed by him to have\u00a0 the\u00a0 same\u00a0 effect as\u00a0 though previously authorized by me.\"\u00a0\u00a0 In the case under consideration the order of July 12, 1898, was the power of\u00a0 attorney which the President executed to his representatives in the Philippines, and afterwards Congress,\u00a0 the principal, in order to avoid the disastrous results that would have followed, elected to ratify the acts\u00a0 of said\u00a0 representatives.\u00a0\u00a0 It\u00a0 seems\u00a0 to me that no one will\u00a0 contend\u00a0 that the ratification\u00a0 in the example given had the effect of reviving the power of attorney in question as an authority for new transactions; the substitute\u00a0 could not pretend, by virtue of said ratification, to do or perform other acts of a similar nature.<\/p><p>The illustration given above may be carried still further by adding this feature:\u00a0 The principal in\u00a0 the\u00a0 meantime executes\u00a0 a new power of attorney\u00a0 without reference whatever to the former agent who undertook to represent him, covering the\u00a0 same\u00a0 subject\u00a0 and\u00a0 providing other\u00a0 means, methods\u00a0 and forms for\u00a0 carrying\u00a0 out his will.\u00a0\u00a0 Who will contend that by virtue\u00a0 of the ratification referred to the old power of attorney was revived in the face of the new one executed by the same principal, making the old power effective as to new transactions?\u00a0 Would it not be\u00a0 said, rather, that the ratification in such case had the effect only of confirming acts<em> which had already been performed, <\/em>and that for all other purposes the first power of attorney had become\u00a0 null and void?\u00a0 The Government of the Philippine Islands, acting under the authority conferred\u00a0 upon it\u00a0 by Congress, the principal, passed a new law\u00a0 on November 15, 1901; that is to\u00a0 say, Congress executed\u00a0 a new power of attorney to its agents\u00a0 in\u00a0 the Philippines providing new conditions and establishing a new basis for the imposition of customs\u00a0 duties.\u00a0 But, notwithstanding this\u00a0 new power of attorney, an evil\u00a0 existed\u00a0 which threatened a\u00a0 serious shrinkage in the public funds.\u00a0 This condition\u00a0 was caused by the\u00a0 lack of authority\u00a0 on\u00a0 the part\u00a0 of\u00a0 the President to delegate to his agents in the Philippines the power to collect customs duties upon goods and merchandise imported from the United\u00a0 States during the period intervening between the treaty of raris and the passage of the new Tarriff Act. It became\u00a0 necessary to meet the conditions thus created so as to prevent the Treasury, not of the Philippine Islands, but of the United States, from being depleted.\u00a0 Now,\u00a0 although\u00a0 it be admitted that the military order of the President, the former power of attorney, was\u00a0 valid, yet it was completely abrogated and superseded by the new law, power of attorney, covering the same subject.\u00a0\u00a0 It would appear, therefore, that the ratification of the old law could\u00a0 have no other effect than to prevent suits against the Government for the\u00a0 return of\u00a0 the duties <em>collected<\/em>\u00a0 thereunder. The Government accordingly confined itself simply to ratifying the collection of the duties already turned into the treasury by its customs officials.<\/p><p>In my judgment, the Supreme Court of the United States has thus interpreted the ratification act in question in the case of United States<em> vs.<\/em> Heinszen &amp; Co. (206 U. S., 370, 382).\u00a0\u00a0 In that case Heinszen sued for the return of certain duties paid during the period covered\u00a0 by the complaint in this case, and\u00a0 the Supreme Court,\u00a0 speaking through Mr. Justice\u00a0 White,\u00a0 now Chief Justice, after first referring to the various decisions above mentioned, said:<\/p><p>\"Applying the doctrine settled by\u00a0 this court in the cases to which we have referred, concerning the\u00a0 power to levy tariff duties under the authority of the President, on goods taken from\u00a0 the\u00a0 United States into Porto\u00a0 Rico and\u00a0 the Philippine\u00a0 Islands, or brought into the United States from either of such\u00a0 countries subsequent to the\u00a0 ratification of the treaty and prior to the levy by Congress of tariff duties, it is obvious that\u00a0 the court below correctly held that such tariff exactions were\u00a0 illegal.\u00a0 It follows, therefore,\u00a0 that the only question\u00a0 open\u00a0 for consideration is whether\u00a0 the court below erred in refusing to give effect to the\u00a0 Act of Congress of June\u00a0 30, 1906, which ratified\u00a0 the collection of the duties levied under the order of\u00a0 the President.<\/p><p>\"As the\u00a0 text of\u00a0 the Act of Congress is unambiguous and manifests as explicitly as can be done the\u00a0 purpose of Congress to ratify,\u00a0 the case\u00a0 comes to the\u00a0 simple question whether Congress possessed the power to ratify which it assumed to exercise.\u00a0 When the controversy is thus reduced to its ultimate\u00a0 issue we\u00a0 think the error committed\u00a0 by the court below, both in reason and\u00a0 authority,\u00a0 is\u00a0 readily demonstrable.<\/p><p>\"That where an agent, without precedent\u00a0 authority, has exercised in\u00a0 the name of\u00a0 a principal a power which\u00a0 the principal had the\u00a0 capacity to bestow, the principal may ratify and affirm\u00a0 the unauthorized\u00a0 act, and thus retroactively give it validity\u00a0 when rights\u00a0 of\u00a0 third persons have not intervened, is so elementary as to need\u00a0 but a statement. That\u00a0 the power of ratification as to matters within their authority\u00a0 may be exercised by Congress,\u00a0 State governments or municipal corporations,\u00a0 is also elementary.\u00a0\u00a0 We shall\u00a0 not stop to review the whole subject or cite the numerous\u00a0 cases contained in the books dealing with the matter, but content\u00a0 ourselves\u00a0 with referring to two\u00a0 cases as\u00a0 to the power of Congress, which are apposite and illustrative.\"<\/p><p>The\u00a0 court then proceeds to\u00a0 analyze certain decision relative of the power of Congress to ratify acts performed without authority and enters upon an examination of the case before it for the purpose\u00a0 of determining whether any exception existed which would prevent the application of the\u00a0 doctrine, arriving finally\u00a0 to\u00a0 a consideration\u00a0 of the reasons advanced by the adverse\u00a0 party in support of\u00a0 its contention that Congress had\u00a0 no pow\u00a3r to make the ratification.\u00a0\u00a0 Coming to the second reason thus advanced, it says :<\/p><p>\"Second.\u00a0 As the duties collected were illegal, it is insisted that, for the purpose of testing the validity of the Act of Congress\u00a0 the fact\u00a0 of such collection must be\u00a0 put out of view, and\u00a0 the\u00a0 act ratifying the exaction must be\u00a0 treated as if it were solely an original\u00a0 exercise by Congress of the taxing power.\u00a0 This being done, it is said, reduces the case to the inquiry, had Congress power, years after goods which\u00a0 were entitled to free entry had been brought into the Philippine Islands, to retroactively impose tariff duties upon the consummated act of bringing the goods\u00a0 into that country?\u00a0 But the\u00a0 proposition begs the question\u00a0 for decision, by shutting out from view\u00a0 the potential fact that when the goods\u00a0 were brought into the Philippine Islands there was\u00a0 a tariff in existence under which duties were exacted in\u00a0 the\u00a0 name\u00a0 of the United\u00a0 States.\u00a0 Indeed, the contention\u00a0 goes further even\u00a0 than this, since\u00a0 it entirely disregards the important consideration that\u00a0 although the duties\u00a0 were illegally\u00a0 exacted\u00a0 the illegality\u00a0 was\u00a0 not\u00a0 the result\u00a0 of an inherent want of power\u00a0 in the United States to have authorized the imposition of the duties\u00a0 but simply arose from the failure to delegate to the official the authority essential to give immediate validity to his\u00a0 conduct in enforcing the\u00a0 payment\u00a0 of the duties.\u00a0 And when these misconceptions are borne in mind it\u00a0 results\u00a0 that the unsoundness of the proposition relied upon\u00a0 is demonstrated by the application of the elementary\u00a0 principle\u00a0 of ratification to which we have previously referred.\u00a0 Moreover, the fallacy which the proposition\u00a0 involves\u00a0 becomes yet more obvious when it is observed that\u00a0 the contention can\u00a0 not even\u00a0 be formulated without misstating\u00a0 the\u00a0 nature\u00a0 of the Act of Congress;\u00a0 in other\u00a0 words,\u00a0 without treating that act as retrospective legislation enacting a tariff, when on its\u00a0 very face the act\u00a0 is but an\u00a0 exercise of the conceded power dependent upon the law of agency to ratify\u00a0 an act done on behalf of the United States which the United States could have originally authorized.\"<\/p><p>In further demonstration of the fact that the purpose of the Act was to\u00a0 ratify collections already made and\u00a0 not to revive the former\u00a0 military order so as to authorize new impositions thereunder,\u00a0 the court\u00a0 said:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"Third.\u00a0 It is urged that the ratifying statute can not be given effect without violating the fifth amendment\u00a0 to the Constitution, since to give efficacy to the\u00a0 Act would deprive the claimants of their property without due process of law, or would appropriate the same for public use without just compensation.\u00a0\u00a0 This rests\u00a0 upon these two contentions: It is said that the money paid to discharge the illegally exacted duties after\u00a0 payment,\u00a0 as before, 'justly and equitably belonged' to the claimants, and that the title thereto continued in them as a vested right of property.\u00a0\u00a0 It is consequently insisted that the right to recover the money could\u00a0 not be taken away without violating the fifth amendment, as\u00a0 stated. But here, again,\u00a0 the argument disregards the fact that when the duties were\u00a0 illegally exacted in the name of the United States Congress possessed the power to have authorized their\u00a0 imposition in the mode in which they were enforced, and hence from the very moment of collection a right in Congress to ratify the transaction,\u00a0 if it saw fit to\u00a0 do\u00a0 so, was engendered.\u00a0 In other words, as a necessary result of the power to ratify, it followed that the right to recover the duties in question was subject to the exercise by Congress of its undoubted power to ratify,\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>It is thus clearly seen not only that the Act in question had no other purpose than to ratify the collections already made under the\u00a0 military order, but also that\u00a0 the only\u00a0 right of the Act to exist\u00a0 at all was the power of Congress to ratify said collections,\u00a0 since the court completely disapproves and overrules the contention that the Act retroactively provided a tariff for the<em> imposition and collection<\/em> of duties on goods which had escaped the\u00a0 illegal\u00a0 exaction and\u00a0 which\u00a0 were imported into the country without the payment of\u00a0 duty, holding\u00a0 that\u00a0 the right of Congress to ratify\u00a0 arose immediately upon and as a result of <em>the payment of the money<\/em>, that is to say, the performance of the acts in behalf of and in the name of\u00a0 the principal.<\/p><p>Reduced as it is to one of ratification, the question seems simple.\u00a0 If an agent,\u00a0 acting in the name of his principal, but without authority, should sell property, it\u00a0 is\u00a0 certain that,\u00a0 immediately upon such sale, that is to say, upon the complete performance of the act, the principal would have the right to disavow or ratify the act.\u00a0 But if, as in the case at bar, the agent did not\u00a0 actually\u00a0 sell\u00a0 the property or perform any other act unauthorized, the right never arose in favor\u00a0 of the principal, the United States or the Philippine Islands,\u00a0 either to ratify or repudiate the transaction.\u00a0 As nothing\u00a0 was done, there was\u00a0 nothing to repudiate or to ratify.\u00a0\u00a0 As the goods imported by the defendant\u00a0 in this case escaped not only without the payment of duties illegally demanded, but also the imposition as well, there was nothing to ratify except\u00a0 perhaps the free entry.\u00a0 We thus arrive at the same conclusion as before, that is to say, that the purpose\u00a0 of the act under consideration was\u00a0 to maintain the <em>statu\u00a0 quo<\/em> and to avoid disturbing or undoing acts which had already been performed.\u00a0 In other words, the intention of Congress was to close the old books completely and\u00a0 with new and ample powers\u00a0 to its\u00a0 agent, open a new set for current\u00a0 operations only.<\/p><p>This interpretation of this Act of Congress appears to be the logical one.\u00a0\u00a0 Any other interpretation, it seems\u00a0 to me, would give it\u00a0 a\u00a0 retroactive effect, something which\u00a0 the courts always\u00a0 endeavor to avoid.\u00a0 It is a well-known principle\u00a0 of\u00a0 statutory construction,\u00a0 of universal application, that, constitutional questions excepted, a law will not be so construed as to affect transactions already consummated, unless it\u00a0 clearly appears that the legislature intended to the contrary.\u00a0 It is incumbent upon the party urging such interpretation to show some\u00a0 legal\u00a0 provision\u00a0 which so directs; for the declaration contained in article 3 of the Civil Code to the effect that \"laws shall not have a retroactive effect unless otherwise provided therein\" lays\u00a0 down an unquestioned principle of American as\u00a0 well as\u00a0 Spanish\u00a0 law.<\/p><p>Lewis Sutherland on Statutory Construction (vol. 2, p. \u00a0 641), says:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"To avoid injustice and unconstitutionally, it\u00a0 is always laid down as a rule of construction that\u00a0 a statute is to be taken\u00a0 or construed as prospective, unless its language is inconsistent with that interpretation.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>In support\u00a0 of\u00a0 this\u00a0 proposition many cases are cited. The same author in the same volume at\u00a0 page\u00a0 1157, section 641, says:<\/p><p>\"Retrospective statutes relate\u00a0 to\u00a0 past\u00a0 acts and transactions.\u00a0\u00a0 Retroactive statutes are those which operate on such acts and transactions and change their legal\u00a0 character or effect.\u00a0\u00a0 (This would be the effect of the act in question when applied\u00a0 to\u00a0 the case\u00a0 under\u00a0 consideration.)\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 As retrospective laws are generally unjust and in many cases oppressive, they are not looked upon with favor.\u00a0 Says the court in Montpelier <em>vs.<\/em> Senter (72 Vt., 112, 47 Atl., 392), 'Retrospective\u00a0 legislation is not favored,\u00a0 and is prohibited by the constitution of some of the states, as being highly injurious, oppressive and unjust; and nowhere will retrospective effect\u00a0 be given to a statute unless it appears that it was the intent of the legislature that it should have such effect.'\u00a0\u00a0 And the supreme court of Minnesota says: 'Again, it is a well-settled rule that laws are not to be construed retrospectively, or to have a retrospective effect,\u00a0 unless it shall clearly appear that it was so intended by\u00a0 the enacting body, and unless such construction is\u00a0 absolutely necessary to give meaning\u00a0 to the language used.'\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Citing Brown vs. Hughes, 89\u00a0 Minn., 150, 153, 94 N.

The exercise of a\u00a0 right conferred\u00a0 by a valid contract,\u00a0 in the manner provided by its terms, can not be the ground\u00a0 of an action.\u00a0\u00a0 The law will not inquire into the motives of the party exercising such right,\u00a0 however unfriendly and selfish.\u00a0\u00a0 The trouble and\u00a0 expense\u00a0 and risk of loss\u00a0 ought to and must be presumed to have been contemplated when the contract\u00a0 was entered into.\u00a0 The foreclosure\u00a0 of a mortgage under a power of sale, for example, may be made at such time\u00a0 and under such\u00a0 circumstances as\u00a0 to cause great distress and sacrifice to the mortgagor; but, whatever\u00a0 the motive of the mortgagee, no remedy\u00a0 is afforded for his oppressive conduct, if the requirements of the contract have been fulfilled.<\/p><p>\"But\u00a0 a more important consideration in this connection is,\u00a0 that\u00a0 the damage which this doctrine contemplates must not only be caused by the fraud and misconduct of the defendant, but it must be the\u00a0 direct and immediate consequence of the wrongful act.\u00a0 The law looks to the proximate and not the remote cause of the injury.\u00a0 It were infinite, says Lord Bacon, to consider the causes of causes and their impulsion of each other; therefore it contenteth itself with the immediate cause,\u00a0 and judgeth of acts\u00a0 by that, without looking\u00a0 to any\u00a0 further degree.\u00a0 This is the only practical rule which, in\u00a0 view of the complication which surrounds this doctrine of causation, can be adopted in the administration\u00a0 of justice by human\u00a0 tribunals.\u00a0 Where the fraud and damage sustain this intimate\u00a0 relation of proximate cause and effect, and not otherwise, they are said to concur, in the sense of the proposition above stated.<\/p><p>\"Applying the doctrine thus explained to the plaintiff's case as stated in the first count, we are of opinion that he sets forth no legal cause of\u00a0 action.\u00a0\u00a0 The declaration shows no consideration for the alleged promise of the mortgagees to inform\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiff, in\u00a0 case\u00a0 the amount of the\u00a0 debt should be wanted by them.\u00a0 It was an agreement not legally binding\u00a0 upon them. . There was nothing in it\u00a0 to prevent them in\u00a0 law from proceeding to do all\u00a0 the acts\u00a0 in relation to advertising and selling the property which were done by the defendants; nor did it prevent them from assigning the mortgage.\u00a0\u00a0 It can not be said to be an invasion of any legal right for the defendants to deprive the plaintiff\u00a0 even by falsehood of the\u00a0 benefit of this\u00a0 gratuitous\u00a0 undertaking. (Hutchins<em> vs<\/em>. Hutchins, 7 Hill, 104.)\u00a0 It is not alleged that the defendants knew of the alleged promise of the mortgagees.\u00a0 The false representation of\u00a0 a material\u00a0 existing fact for\u00a0 the purpose of procuring the transfer might have enabled the mortgagees to avoid it, or\u00a0 maintain an action for any loss sustained by them, but until avoided\u00a0 the\u00a0 title passed to the defendant.\u00a0 If the declaration had contained averments of a good legal consideration for the promise to give notice\u00a0 to the plaintiff, then it\u00a0 would seem to follow that the plaintiff's\u00a0 remedy would be\u00a0 ample against\u00a0 the mortgagees\u00a0 for all loss suffered by him by reason of\u00a0 the breach of their agreement, leaving them to whatever remedy they might have against the defendants\u00a0 for the fraud practiced by them.\u00a0 And this fact is said by Morton, J., in Lamb<em> vs.<\/em> Stone (11 Pick., 532), which was a case like this, to be good ground for\u00a0 refusing relief; for if the plaintiff\u00a0 'may have redress by any of the forms of actions now known and practiced, it would be unwise and unsafe to sanction an untried one, the\u00a0 practical operation of which can not be fully\u00a0 foreseen.'<\/p><p>\"But the more important\u00a0 fact is, that this specific act of obtaining the assignment in the manner stated in itself produced no direct and immediate damage to the plaintiff. The damage resulted solely from the foreclosure and forced sale of the premises, and would have been no more and no less if the mortgage had not been assigned, and the mortgagees had pursued precisely the course charged upon the defendants in regard to the sale.\u00a0 It was undoubtedly a necessary step in order that the defendants might practice the alleged oppression; but it was not the\u00a0 immediate cause of the injury.\u00a0 The substantial, efficient and immediate cause\u00a0 of the\u00a0 loss\u00a0 to the\u00a0 plaintiff was the foreclosure and sale.\u00a0\u00a0 And we are not permitted to go behind and inquire into the antecedent causes, near\u00a0 or remote.\u00a0\u00a0 (Marble <em>vs.<\/em> Worcester, 4\u00a0 Gray,\u00a0 395;\u00a0 Tisdale <em>vs.<\/em> Norton, 8 Met., 388.) We lay out of the case, therefore, that part of it which rests upon the false representations made to procure the transfer of the mortgage.\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"The cases cited by the plaintiff\u00a0 we think\u00a0 ought not to control us in this result.\u00a0 In Benton\u00a0 vs. Pratt (2 Wend., 385), the court says:\u00a0 'Here is the assertion of an unqualified falsehood with a fraudulent intent as to a present or existing fact, and a direct, positive and material injury\u00a0 resulting therefrom to the plaintiff\/\u00a0 In the American note to Pasley vs. Freeman\u00a0 (2 Smith's Lead. Cas., 153), this case, it is said, certainly goes very far; but whether open to criticism or not in its main doctrine, it differs in\u00a0 the material point above\u00a0 indicated from the present case.\u00a0\u00a0 So in Green\u00a0 vs. Button (Tyrwh. &amp; Grang., 118), it was held that the damage to the\u00a0 plaintiff by delaying him.in his work and injuring his credit directly resulted from the defendant's act\u00a0 In the Tun bridge Wells Dippers' case (2 Wils., 414), while the court remarked that there was a real damage in depriving the plaintiff\u00a0 of some gratuity, they also say in\u00a0 the same sentence that the injury was by disturbing the dippers in the exercise of their right or employment, which\u00a0 it seems by some private statute they were entitled to.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Even under the authorities which\u00a0 hold that the invasion of a legal right is actionable even though no actual damage results\u00a0 (Webb vs. Portland Mfg. Co.,\u00a0 3 Sumn., 189),\u00a0 still the case of the government would not be improved.\u00a0\u00a0 The fact still remains that no legal\u00a0 right\u00a0 of the government was invaded\u00a0 by\u00a0 the defendant.\u00a0 The defendant presents both defenses. First, that there was no invasion of a legal right; and second, that there was no damage.<\/p><p>The Government's contention in this case may be reduced to this:\u00a0 A judge of whatever category, under a mistaken conception of the powers of his office, undertakes to impose fines on all persons arriving at Manila from Hongkong;\u00a0 and accordingly orders the bailiff of the court to watch at the wharf and arrest and bring before him all persons coming from said pert.\u00a0 The judge succeeds in imposing a number of fines; but some of the persons escaped the fines either by landing at\u00a0 night or deceiving the court or the bailiff by asserting that they\u00a0 came\u00a0 from Singapore\u00a0 and not from Hongkong.\u00a0 The\u00a0 illegal conduct of the judge finally comes to the knowledge of the Philippine Legislature, and\u00a0 the latter, believing that of\u00a0 two evils the\u00a0 lesser would be\u00a0 the ratification of\u00a0 the acts of the judge, passes an act providing that all\u00a0 fines thus imposed are legalized and their collection ratified\u00a0 with the same force and effect as if\u00a0 they had been previously authorized by the Legislature under a law enacted for that purpose.\u00a0 Can it be successfully maintained that those who escaped or evaded the fines were guilty of fraud and are, therefore, by virtue of the ratifying statute, still subject\u00a0 to\u00a0 be\u00a0 prosecuted and fined?\u00a0\u00a0 Can it be said that, notwithstanding the fact that they violated no law in coming to Manila from Hongkong, the deceit practiced on the court brought them,\u00a0 nevertheless, within the provisions of the act ratifying and\u00a0 legalizing the acts of the judge?\u00a0 Or would it be more just and reasonable to say that the only purpose of the ratifying statute was to <em>purge the proceedings<\/em> from a fatal defect and not to authorize retroactively the imposition\u00a0 of new fines?<\/p><p>While\u00a0 I am\u00a0 alone in\u00a0 this dissent, I have the satisfaction of knowing that, while this cause was under discussion by the court in consultation,\u00a0 Judge Trent, now on vacation, expressed views similar to my own.<\/p><p>For these reasons I think the demurrer should have been sustained.<\/p><\/div>",

A. S. Crossfield presiding,\u00a0 dismissing the complaint upon\u00a0 the merits after trial,\u00a0 without costs.<p>The action is one to recover damages for an injury sustained\u00a0 by\u00a0 plaintiff's\u00a0 horse\u00a0 and calesa resulting from\u00a0 a collision between it and a street car belonging to the defendant.\u00a0\u00a0 It seems that,\u00a0 at about 11\u00a0 o'clock on the night in question, the horse and <em>calesa,<\/em> which are the subject of this suit, were being driven along on the left\u00a0 side of Calle Concepcion toward\u00a0 Bagumbayan in\u00a0 a direction substantially west.\u00a0 About the\u00a0 time\u00a0 the horse and <em>calesa<\/em> reached the Y. M. C. A. building a street car belonging to the defendant company, the one that had part in the accident,\u00a0 turned into Concepcion from Bagumbayan and proceeded\u00a0 east\u00a0 along Concepcion toward Marcelino.\u00a0\u00a0 There are\u00a0 two street-car tracks on Concepcion,\u00a0 an east-bound track and a west-bound track.\u00a0 The street car referred to\u00a0 was passing along the east-bound track toward Marcelino, while the\u00a0 calesa was proceeding west toward Bagumbayan between the\u00a0 west-bound track and the curb of the street.\u00a0\u00a0 There\u00a0 was, therefore, between the <em>calesa<\/em> and the east-bound track that part of the street\u00a0 between the curb and the west-bound track, which is reserved for vehicles, and that\u00a0 part occupied by the west-bound\u00a0 track itself.\u00a0 So\u00a0 that before\u00a0 a collision would be possible between the <em>calesa <\/em>and a car upon the east-bound track it would\u00a0 be necessary\u00a0 for the <em>calesa<\/em>\u00a0 to cross not only that part of the street between the west-bound track and the curb but also the west-bound track itself.<\/p><p>The proofs in the case are conflicting in the extreme.\u00a0\u00a0 The <em>cochero<\/em> driving the\u00a0 calesa at the\u00a0 time of\u00a0 the accident, Mariano Alejo, testified (and I preserve as far as possible not only\u00a0 the form of\u00a0 expression but\u00a0 also the\u00a0 words of the witness) that at the time of the accident, which occurred at about 11 o'clock at\u00a0 night,.he was driving the horse and calesa in question along the south side of Calle Concepcion west\u00a0 toward\u00a0 Bagumbayan; that\u00a0 on arriving opposite the Y. M. C. A. building he overtook two refuse carts, traveling in the same direction,\u00a0 the head one of which was covered with a white tarpaulin; that he turned out and passed one of the carts; that in attempting to pass the other the horse got scared at the\u00a0 tarpaulin which was flapping in the wind, and reared; that he reared and shied just as the car rounded from\u00a0 Bagumbayan\u00a0 into\u00a0 Concepcion.\u00a0 In\u00a0 response\u00a0 to the question, \"How many\u00a0 times did your horse go backwards and forwards across the street before the street car struck you?\" the witness answered,\u00a0 \"He was a long time going backwards and forwards, he did not like to pass the cart at all.\"\u00a0 The witness further said that the street car was going fast; that while the horse was misbehaving the witness \"was trying my best to get off the rig and get hold of the horse by the reins, but it was impossible to do anything because the horse was afraid and did not want to go ahead, but\u00a0 went backwards and forwards, and when I attempted to get off my seat the horse tried to turn around;\" that as the street car got near to his calesa\u00a0 he\u00a0 shouted to the motorman to stop as his horse\u00a0 was frightened and would\u00a0 not go ahead and\u00a0 that he shouted several times to the motorman before the street car struck him;\u00a0 that the motorman did not stop the car; that the street car struck the calesa on the right-hand side; that when he was struck the horse was facing the left-hand side of the street; that the calesa was struck first on the shaft; that \"I was going straight along\u00a0 Calle Concepcion towards Calle\u00a0 Bagumbayan and\u00a0 that bull-cart was\u00a0 ahead of me and I wanted to pass it,\u00a0 and then the horse got scared, and I was trying to make him\u00a0 go to the left-hand side and he was trying to go to the right-hand side, and\u00a0 when he got\u00a0 to the left-hand side he\u00a0 got scared and started to rear;\" that the horse was cut on the right-hind leg;\u00a0 that\u00a0 the horse had\u00a0 a bad habit,\u00a0 especially\u00a0 at night, when he would get vicious\u00a0 and scared; that the horse was full of life.<\/p><p>On cross-examination this\u00a0 witness\u00a0 testified\u00a0 that the American, Mr. Strawn, who was the occupant of the <em>calesa,<\/em> told\u00a0 him during the evening to go slow with the horse and to be careful with him as he was acting\u00a0 badly; that the street car was far away from him when he was\u00a0 trying to pass\u00a0 the\u00a0 bull-cart and that\u00a0 he thought\u00a0 he\u00a0 would\u00a0 have plenty of\u00a0 time to pass before the street car would reach him; that the first thing the horse did was to dash across the street car track to the right; that the\u00a0 first thing that struck him was the footboard on the right-hand side\u00a0 of the car; that the portion of the car which\u00a0 struck him was the\u00a0 footboard just at the head of the car in the\u00a0 center of the car; that it was the right-hand corner of the car which struck one of his shafts; that one of his shafts struck the footboard of the car and for that reason the calesa tumbled down; that at the moment the shaft struck the footboard the\u00a0 horse passed by.\u00a0\u00a0 At this point appear the following questions and answers:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"Q.\u00a0 When the horse first got scared the\u00a0 street\u00a0 car was a considerable distance away, was it not? - A. When the horse first started to be mean the street car was far away, but\u00a0 you\u00a0 must take it into consideration that it\u00a0 does\u00a0 not take a very long time to approach, and\u00a0 it did not give me much time.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"Q.\u00a0 The street car was on the opposite side of the street from you, on\u00a0 the right-hand side? - A.\u00a0 Yes, sir.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"Q.\u00a0 Then why could you not\u00a0 have turned around and gone in the opposite direction ? - A. As I have stated, I was between\u00a0 the two carts and had no chance to move, except to go ahead in that direction.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"Q.\u00a0 And you were trying to\u00a0 force\u00a0 your horse to go ahead? - A. Yes, sir;\u00a0 to pass the\u00a0 second cart.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"Q.\u00a0 Why did you\u00a0 not\u00a0 stay in between the\u00a0 two carts instead of trying to\u00a0 pass\u00a0 the\u00a0 second cart, let the horse stay in between the two carts instead of trying to pass? -\u00a0 A. The street car was still far away from me, and the other cart was behind me,\u00a0 and the driver of\u00a0 that cart told me to go ahead.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"Q.\u00a0 And that is why you went ahead, because\u00a0 the man behind you told you to go ahead? - A. Yes, sir.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"Q. If you had stayed where you were, between the two carts, you would have been all\u00a0 right, would you not? - A. We were both going in the same direction,\u00a0 one cart ahead of me and the other cart behind me, and\u00a0 the\u00a0 street car was coming in front; how could I have stopped in that place, the street car would have come on top of me.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"Q. Why the carts were not on the\u00a0 street car track, were they? - . But my rig was on the track.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"Q. But the track the street car was coming on is the track on the opposite side of the street from the Y. M. C. A. building? - A. The street car was coming on the track on the left-hand side, and I was going on the same track.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"Q. Were the carts not\u00a0 on the Y. M.\u00a0 C. A.\u00a0 side near the curb? - A. They were on the left-hand side.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"Q. The side nearest the Y. M. C. A. building? - A. Yes, sir.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"Q. And the street car was on the opposite side of\u00a0 the street? - A.\u00a0 Yes, sir.<\/p><p>\"Q. And you were in between the\u00a0 two carts, had passed one and were behind the other one? - A. I passed one cart and came between the two.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"Q. How far is it from there to the track on the other side of the street? - A.\u00a0 It was far yet when I sighted\u00a0 the street car.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"Q. Then if you\u00a0 had stayed in between the two carts, after\u00a0 having passed\u00a0 one of\u00a0 them, you would\u00a0 have been all right,\u00a0 would\u00a0 you\u00a0 not ? - A. I had passed one of these carts and was trying\u00a0 to pass the other, and one was going ahead and the one behind\u00a0 was going also, and the fellow behind told me to go ahead, and for that reason I\u00a0 had to go, if not he would have\u00a0 spoiled my rig\u00a0 on the back, and as I was going ahead my horse reared.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"Q. And that is why you\u00a0 turned out, is it? - A.\u00a0 Yes, sir.\" This witness denied having stated\u00a0 to Mr. Lurison in\u00a0 the presence of Mr. Bradley, after the accident, that his horse shied\u00a0 at a bull-cart\u00a0 and that in endeavoring to restrain him he pulled the wrong\u00a0 rein and\u00a0 thereby ran into\u00a0 the street car.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Cipriano Nocum, a witness for the\u00a0 plaintiff, testified that on the night\u00a0 in\u00a0 question\u00a0 he was the driver of the cart which\u00a0 the cochero sought\u00a0 to pass with his <em>calesa<\/em> at\u00a0 the time the accident occurred; that the\u00a0 two carts were about twenty varas apart; that the cart he was\u00a0 driving was in the lead; that when he\u00a0 first observed the horse and <em>calesa<\/em> the horse was rearing,\u00a0 and did not want\u00a0 to go ahead\u00a0 but wanted to go backwards; that the cochero was crying\u00a0 out to the motorman to stop the street car; that the\u00a0 street\u00a0 car was going very fast; that it was a dark and cloudy night; that the horse did not stand\u00a0 steady but went backwards and forwards; that in going backwards it crossed the street about three times; that the right-hand front corner of the car struck first; that the car ran about three <em>brazas<\/em> before it was stopped by the motorman.\u00a0 On cross-examination this witness testified that the first thing the horse did was to back somewhat and rear up; that as soon as he saw the white\u00a0 tarpaulin he went\u00a0 backwards from side to side; that he went\u00a0 first to the left side; that the\u00a0 <em>cochero<\/em>\u00a0 succeeded in pulling him to the left side of the street; that he was facing\u00a0 always the left-hand side\u00a0 of the\u00a0 street;\u00a0 that he did not cross the street.\u00a0 These questions were\u00a0 put to him:\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"Q. Did you not say in direct examination that he went across\u00a0 the street\u00a0 three\u00a0 times? - A.\u00a0 Backwards and\u00a0 forwards, I mean to say that the cochero could not keep the horse in the same\u00a0 place, as he would not stay quiet.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"Q. How far did the horse\u00a0 move from one track to the other? - A. I should say that the horse would go backwards about four <em>brazas<\/em> and then rear up again.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"Q. He was not\u00a0 moving very much from\u00a0 one side to the other, just moving backwards\u00a0 and forwards? - A. The cochero was\u00a0 holding on to the reins, trying to bring\u00a0 the horse on the left-hand side so as to pass, and then\u00a0 the horse started to rear up, but always on the left-hand side.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"Q. And he\u00a0 moved very little in that direction? - A.\u00a0 The cochero could\u00a0 not\u00a0 stop the horse in the condition he\u00a0 was in, frightened\u00a0 and\u00a0 going backwards and forwards, but he kept on the same line; of course, there was some change but the tendency was to the left-hand side.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"Q. Always? - A. Yes, sir.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"Q. If he\u00a0 went to the left and went backwards and forwards, he v\/as clear of the track was he not? - A. Just on the track.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"Q. That was the track\u00a0 nearest the\u00a0 Y. M.\u00a0 C. A. building? - A. Yes,\u00a0 sir.<\/p><p>\"Q.\u00a0 And when the street car came along the horse turned from there to the left? - A. He went backwards.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"Q.\u00a0 Back into the\u00a0 street car, so as to throw the <em>calesa<\/em> into the street car? - A. No, sir; it was at the same time, the going\u00a0 backwards of the calesa and the coming of the street car.<\/p><p>\"Q.\u00a0 What part of the calesa struck the street car first? - A. The right-hand side.<\/p><p>\"Q.\u00a0 But what part; the wheel\u00a0 or\u00a0 the shaft? - A. The footboard of the street car struck the wheel of the calesa.<\/p><p>\"Q.\u00a0 What part of\u00a0 the wheel; back\u00a0 or front? = A. The front part\u00a0 of the wheel.<\/p><p>\"Q.\u00a0 Then if the calesa had\u00a0 not backed into the street car, it\u00a0 must have been going ahead ? - A. Yes, sir.<\/p><p>\"Q.\u00a0 The <em>calesa<\/em> approached the street car from the left- hand side\u00a0 of the car, did it? - A.\u00a0 The horse was rearing and backing, and backed into\u00a0 the front of the street car, and the <em>calesa<\/em> struck the right-hand corner of the street car, and the car struck the calesa on the right-hand side.<\/p><p>\"Q.\u00a0 Did\u00a0 you\u00a0 hear the driver\u00a0 of the\u00a0 cart which was behind shout to the driver of the calesa to go ahead? - A.

He testified that he was chief of the property division of the Bureau of Internal Revenue; that he was in\u00a0 the calesa at the time the accident occurred; that on coming down the left-hand side of Calle Concepcion the horse evidently shied, causing him to awake from a doze into which he had fallen, and then<em>\"the first thing I knew\u00a0 the horse commenced to rear, and when he reared he hit the street car,\u00a0 hitting it probably\u00a0 about two seats down,<\/em>\u00a0 and then there was\u00a0 a\u00a0 rebound and\u00a0 he came\u00a0 back again, and then the calesa\u00a0 and the horse were thrown over.\u00a0\u00a0 The calesa also hit\u00a0 the street car, but I don't know what part of it hit the car;\" that the street was wide enough so that the cart could go right up against the curb. <em>\"We were passing between the cart\u00a0 and the street car, or trying to, when the horse begun to rear.\"<\/em><\/p><p>Then follow these questions and answers:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"Q.\u00a0 What happened then ? - A.

I could not say.<\/p><p>\"Q.\u00a0 Approximately; was there any perceptible time,\u00a0 or was it instantly, or what?\u00a0 - A. It might have been ten\u00a0 or twenty seconds, I could not say, I did not pay any attention to the street car at that time, I was watching the horse to see whether <em>we would hit the car, and it looked to me\u00a0 as if we would miss it, consequently I\u00a0 did not jump; if I had thought we were going to hit the street car<\/em> I would have jumped.\"<\/p><p>On cross-examination the following appears:<\/p><p>\"Q.\u00a0 Do you know when the horse first shied at the white tarpaulin\u00a0 on the bull cart? - A. When? I could not say exactly as to when the horse first shied, and I would not say that it shied at the white tarpaulin for I was not watching, I was half\u00a0 asleep when the horse shied and went across the street car track, that was what woke me up.<\/p><p>\"Q. And\u00a0 almost instantly the street car struck the <em>calesa<\/em>?\u00a0 - A. The\u00a0 calesa went back\u00a0 far\u00a0 enough\u00a0 to miss the street car\u00a0 apparently, and\u00a0 had room\u00a0 to pass\u00a0 between the street\u00a0 car\u00a0 and the bull cart; that is,\u00a0 it\u00a0 went back far enough so that it did not appear to me that the street car was going to hit us.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Further, on redirect examination, appears:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"Q.

E. Schiffbauer, called as a witness for the\u00a0 defense, testified:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"That he was the house surgeon at\u00a0 St. Paul's Hospital; that at the time of the collision in question he was on the north\u00a0 side of Concepcion about opposite the Y. M.\u00a0 C.\u00a0 A. building; that he noticed the street\u00a0 car just\u00a0 as it was rounding into\u00a0 Concepcion from Bagumbayan.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>In answer to the question, \"State to the court what you saw,\" the witness said:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"I was walking on Calle\u00a0 Concepcion towards Calle Bagumbayan, and I noticed the car coming just as it rounded the corner of Calle Bagumbayan, and\u00a0 at the time the car was coming I was watching to get a car going the\u00a0 other way so\u00a0 that I could ride into\u00a0 the\u00a0 Walled\u00a0 City.\u00a0\u00a0 I was walking\u00a0 along\u00a0 watching the car when I\u00a0 noticed a calesa coming in the opposite direction to the car, and I noticed that <em>the front\u00a0 end of the calesa passed the front end\u00a0 of the street car, and a few seconds\u00a0 afterwards I heard a crash,<\/em>\u00a0 and the next\u00a0 thing\u00a0 was that the\u00a0 street car was stopped and\u00a0 the\u00a0 calesa upturned, and\u00a0 the horse was injured I think on\u00a0 the\u00a0 right hind leg, and the occupant\u00a0 of the <em>calesa<\/em> was standing by looking at the smash-up of the <em>calesa<\/em>.\u00a0\u00a0 This happened just opposite the Y. M. C. A. building, I think a\u00a0 little towards the Calle San Marcelino side. When I first noticed the horse and\u00a0 the <em>calesa <\/em>they were ahead of the car going in the opposite direction.\u00a0 When I first noticed the calesa it was about\u00a0 two street car lengths ahead of the car.<em> At that time the horse was going along peaceably and\u00a0 seemingly\u00a0 the cochero had\u00a0 the horse under perfect control.<\/em>\u00a0 I should say the car was going at the rate of\u00a0 the\u00a0 five points, say eight to ten\u00a0 miles an hour. <em> Apparently the motorman had the street car under perfect control,<\/em> and it seems <em>the front end of the\u00a0 calesa went by the street\u00a0 car\u00a0 and then crashed in<\/em>, and the next thing I could hear the\u00a0 wheels grinding, and the street car<em> went a length or a length and a half and then stopped.\u00a0\u00a0 The calesa had passed the front end of the street car before the collision occurred, <\/em> I did not notice how far\u00a0 the calesa was from the curb on the Y. M. C. A.\u00a0 side\u00a0 of the street, but\u00a0 it seemed to\u00a0 me that<em> there\u00a0 was plenty\u00a0 of room in which to get around, everything was going along nicely, there was plenty of room for everybody,<\/em> but\u00a0 I did\u00a0 not notice the exact distance\u00a0 of the space between the <em> calesa <\/em>and the curb.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Modesto Medina,\u00a0 the motorman, testified that he was motorman on the car at the time the collision occurred; that he had been working for the company about one year prior to the accident; that the car was coming from the Rotonda and going to Santa Ana.\u00a0 He said:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"As I have stated I was coming from the Rotonda and going in the direction of Santa Ana, and upon\u00a0 turning into Calle Concepcion from Calle Bagumbayan, near the City Hall, I saw a carretela coming, and rang the bell, and continued ringing\u00a0 it until I\u00a0 had a speed of five points, and when I was near the Y. M. C. A. building I saw a <em>calesa<\/em> coming.\u00a0 The calesa was\u00a0 following a bull\u00a0 cart.\u00a0 The bull cart was on Calle Concepcion in front of the Division Hospital and the Y. M.\u00a0 C. A. building.\u00a0 The bull\u00a0 cart was on my right, near the side walk.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 calesa was following the bull cart and was also near the sidewalk immediately behind the bull cart.\u00a0 My car was I believe about 2 brazas from the bull cart when\u00a0 I first observed the\u00a0 calesa behind it\u00a0 The <em>calesa<\/em> was about 30 feet away when\u00a0 I first saw it. I rang the bell when I first saw it.\u00a0\u00a0 When the <em>calesa<\/em> was about to come into the same line as\u00a0 the bull cart the horse turned to the right and of course\u00a0 collided with my car. What I mean by coming into\u00a0 line\u00a0 with the bull cart is when\u00a0 the\u00a0 car and the bull\u00a0 cart\u00a0 were opposite each other, at that moment the horse turned to the right and collided with the street car;\u00a0 it\u00a0 was something over two\u00a0 seconds from the moment the horse turned\u00a0 out until\u00a0 it struck\u00a0 the street car.\u00a0 <em> Up to the time the\u00a0 horse\u00a0 turned out towards the street car he had not\u00a0 been rearing at\u00a0 all.\u00a0 He was running, just following the bull cart.\u00a0 The calesa had already cleared the front of my car when he struck me.\u00a0 The calesa struck the car at the second hand grab. <\/em>\u00a0 The wheel of the <em>calesa<\/em> went between the footboard of the street car and the body of the car.\u00a0\u00a0 And the brass work was\u00a0 broken there. Three hand grabs\u00a0 were broken off.\u00a0 When the <em>calesa<\/em> struck me I stopped and\u00a0 reversed.\u00a0 After I reversed I ran about half the length of\u00a0 the car before stopping.\"<\/p><p>A photograph having been shown the witness,\u00a0 he testified: \"That shows that the calesa went over to the right-hand side,\u00a0 and for that reason the collision took place.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>On cross-examination the witness\u00a0 said:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"He [meaning the driver of the <em>calesa<\/em>]<em> is\u00a0 the one who collided with me;\u00a0 that is\u00a0 the truth, he is the\u00a0 one who collided with me. <\/em>*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 I was going five points.\u00a0 Very fast is nine points but that night I was going five points. The reason why I\u00a0 remember that we were going only five points when the street car struck the calesa is because that was the instruction given\u00a0 by the\u00a0 superintendent that after 8.30 o'clock at night the speed should be only five points. If I ran more than five points after\u00a0 half past 8 o'clock it would be in violation of the rules.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The <em>cochero<\/em> driving the calesa in\u00a0 question testified that after the\u00a0 collision\u00a0 he went to the\u00a0 hospital and\u00a0 did\u00a0 not return to the scene of the accident again that night.\u00a0 In this he is contradicted by the witnesses Bradley and Lurison. Both of these witnesses testified\u00a0 that\u00a0 after they had taken the\u00a0 <em>cochero<\/em> to the hospital and returned to the scene of the accident for the purpose of clearing up the wreck, the <em>cochero<\/em> returned there and\u00a0 that they had a conversation with him at that time.\u00a0 The witness Lurison testified as follows:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"Then about that time I saw the cochero who had been hurt coming up the street, and I asked him what he was doing back there, and why he was not at the hospital, and he said that he felt pretty good and came back to get things together.\u00a0\u00a0 Then I\u00a0 asked him for\u00a0 a\u00a0 statement regarding the accident, and he said that he was driving along behind a bull cart, and that his horse shied, and when the horse shied he did not know exactly what happened, but that one rein got\u00a0 caught under the shaft and\u00a0 when he\u00a0 wanted to pull he pulled\u00a0 the\u00a0 wrong rein, and pulled the\u00a0 horse into the car.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The witnesses Bradley and Lurison also testified that the front of the calesa had struck the street car on the side; that three of the grab handles were knocked off; that the first grab handle on the side of the car was not touched, but, <em>beginning with\u00a0 the second one,\u00a0 two or three\u00a0 were broken loose\u00a0 from the car; that the second grab handle is about four feet from the front of the car.<\/em><\/p><p>As\u00a0 is seen from the testimony presented by\u00a0 these witnesses there is almost perfect agreement between the declarations of the motorman of the car, of Mr. Strawn and of Doctor Schiffbauer.\u00a0 From their evidence it\u00a0 is clear to us that everything relating to the accident, from the beginning to the end, happened almost instantly.\u00a0\u00a0 These witnesses make\u00a0 it clear that the collision occurred\u00a0 thus: The <em>cochero<\/em> sought to pass the garbage cart just about the time the street car reached a point opposite the cart; that there was plenty of room, there being between\u00a0 the garbage cart and the street\u00a0 car that portion of the street between the garbage cart and the west-bound track and the west-bound track\u00a0 itself; that as the <em>cochero<\/em> urged the horse around the\u00a0 end of the garbage cart it\u00a0 became frightened at the white\u00a0 tarpaulin, and rearing leaped sideways away from the\u00a0 cart and toward the street car; that\u00a0 before anything could\u00a0 be done\u00a0 to restrain him he had\u00a0 dashed across the west-bound track and leaped head foremost into the side of the car.\u00a0 The allegation\u00a0 of the plaintiff that\u00a0 the car struck the <em>calesa<\/em> head-on or nearly so\u00a0 is entirely unsupported except by the jumbled testimony of the\u00a0 <em>cochero<\/em> and the\u00a0 drivers of\u00a0 the garbage carts.\u00a0 Their evidence\u00a0 is\u00a0 completely nullified by the clear and\u00a0 forceful testimony of disinterested witnesses and by the condition of the street car after the accident.\u00a0 Mr.\u00a0 Strawn and Doctor\u00a0 Schiffbauer, reputable men and entirely disinterested so far as appears, are\u00a0 in perfect\u00a0 accord in\u00a0 saying\u00a0 that nothing\u00a0 occurred to attract attention prior to the attempt\u00a0 of the <em>cochero<\/em>\u00a0 to turn out and pass the garbage cart, <em>at which time the street car\u00a0 was nearly opposite the cart;<\/em> that up\u00a0 to that moment the\u00a0 horse was\u00a0 going along quietly,\u00a0 under\u00a0 perfect control, exhibiting no symptoms of fright or unsteadiness; that it was\u00a0 only when\u00a0 passing the cart that he became unmanage- able, and that<em> was at the very moment that the street car was\u00a0 about to reach a point alongside the garbage cart.<\/em>\u00a0 It may have been,\u00a0 and it is quite\u00a0 possible,\u00a0 that in\u00a0 coming alongside the cart the horse\u00a0 not\u00a0 only reared but hesitated about\u00a0 going forward, or even backed slightly; but it\u00a0 is certain that the unusual activities of the horse were very limited prior to\u00a0 the collision.\u00a0 All the subsequent events sprang from the attempt of\u00a0 the\u00a0 driver to\u00a0 force the horse past\u00a0 the garbage\u00a0 cart.\u00a0 The\u00a0 animal,\u00a0 becoming\u00a0 greatly frightened at the tarpaulin, dashed head foremost into the side\u00a0 of the car, preferring that alternative to\u00a0 the greater danger which, to him, lay in the bull cart and white\u00a0 tarpaulin.\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. Strawn says:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"What first attracted my attention\u00a0 was\u00a0 the\u00a0 fact of the horse rearing, <em>and when he reared the street car was right onto\u00a0 us,<\/em> and had the horse not reared we could\u00a0 have gotten through probably.\u00a0 And\u00a0 the\u00a0 horse\u00a0 was\u00a0 far\u00a0 enough past the street car so that <em>when he reared he hit his feet about the second or third seat down the street car.\"<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote><p>That the horse ran\u00a0 backwards and forwards across the street\u00a0 in front of the\u00a0 street car for five\u00a0 minutes as testified\u00a0 one of the witnesses for the plaintiff, or several times as testified two others, is incredible under all of the\u00a0 evidence in this case.\u00a0 It is unbelievable that Mr. Strawn, the occupant of the <em>calesa,<\/em> who\u00a0 said that he\u00a0 was awakened from his doze\u00a0 or revery\u00a0 by the rearing\u00a0 of the horse the instant before the collision, would have remained dozing up to that moment if the horse had been rearing and plunging backwards and forwards across the\u00a0 street and the <em>cochero<\/em> had\u00a0 been shouting to the\u00a0 motorman\u00a0 to stop the car.\u00a0 It is very improbable that this\u00a0 could have occurred and not been seen and heard by Doctor Schiffbauer, who at the time was at the very point where the accident\u00a0 occurred and who saw every act and perceived every condition up to the very time of the collision.\u00a0 The condition of the car after the event is also a complete refutation of the testimony\u00a0 of the plaintiff's witnesses who assert that the car\u00a0 ran into the calesa rather than that the <em>calesa<\/em> ran into the car.\u00a0 The testimony of Doctor Schiffbauer, of Mr. Strawn\u00a0 and of the motorman\u00a0 is to the effect that the\u00a0 front end of the car had\u00a0 passed the horse\u00a0 and\u00a0 <em>calesa <\/em> before\u00a0 the\u00a0 collision occurred.\u00a0\u00a0 The condition of the car after the accident completely\u00a0 and in every\u00a0 detail corroborates this testimony. An examination of the car disclosed that the horse or <em>calesa<\/em> had\u00a0 struck the side of the car at least four feet from the front righthand corner; that from\u00a0 that\u00a0 point on toward the rear of the car several grab handles, that is, the handles which are seized by passengers in entering and leaving the car,\u00a0 were\u00a0 broken\u00a0 off\u00a0 by\u00a0 the force\u00a0 of the collision.\u00a0 No damage was done to the\u00a0 end\u00a0 of the car or to the corner. <em>The\u00a0 first grab\u00a0 handle\u00a0 was\u00a0 intact<\/em>.\u00a0 The only\u00a0 marks upon the\u00a0 car and the only injuries observable\u00a0 were those upon the\u00a0 side, several feet from the front\u00a0 and corner.\u00a0\u00a0 From the testimony of Mr. Strawn it is clear that the horse rather than the calesa struck the car first.\u00a0 He asserts that the horse reared and when\u00a0 he reared he leaped against the car, striking it with his feet about two or three seats down; that then there was a rebound, the horse having probably been thrown away from the car by the force of the impact, thus turning the rear end of the calesa toward the car and bringing it into contact with it.<\/p><p>That\u00a0 the <em>cochero<\/em> called to the motorman to stop the car we believe is equally\u00a0 incredible.\u00a0 Two witnesses for the plaintiff testified\u00a0 that the <em>cochero<\/em> called to the\u00a0 motorman to stop.\u00a0 One of them is\u00a0 the<em> cochero<\/em> himself and the other the\u00a0 driver of one of the\u00a0 bull carts.\u00a0 The driver\u00a0 of the other bull\u00a0 cart testified that he did not hear the <em>cochero<\/em> call\u00a0 to the motorman.\u00a0 Mr. Strawn, who was within\u00a0 two feet of\u00a0 the <em>cochero <\/em> at the time, testified that he did not hear any\u00a0 such\u00a0 outcry, and Doctor Schiffbauer,\u00a0 who stood upon the sidewalk at the place where the accident occurred, stated that no such thing happened.\u00a0 This is also the testimony\u00a0 of the\u00a0 motorman,\u00a0 who asserted\u00a0 that\u00a0 he saw\u00a0 and heard nothing out of the ordinary until\u00a0 the very moment when he came\u00a0 opposite the garbage cart, when the horse which was just turning out from behind\u00a0 the same reared and\u00a0 leaped into the side of his car.\u00a0\u00a0 On cross-examination he insisted on the proposition that it was the <em>calesa<\/em> that struck the car and not the car that struck the <em>calesa.<\/em><\/p><p>The\u00a0 theory of\u00a0 negligence presented by the arguments of plaintiff's\u00a0 counsel is that the motorman having for\u00a0 a distance of 25 rods or more seen an unmanageable horse running backwards and\u00a0 forwards across the track upon which the\u00a0 street\u00a0 car was running ought\u00a0 to have stopped his car before reaching\u00a0 the danger point, and that\u00a0 not having done so but having continued on his course at full speed regardless of the probability of a collision, he was guilty of negligence\u00a0 and\u00a0 the company was responsible for the results thereof.\u00a0 As we have already said, this theory is untenable as the facts presented to support it are disproved by the clear weight of the evidence.<\/p><p>We are of the opinion that the judgment of the\u00a0 court below is supported by the clear weight of the evidence and should be and is hereby affirmed, without special finding as to costs.<\/p><p>So ordered.<\/p><p><em>Arellano, C, J., Torres, Carson,<\/em> and <em>Trent, JJ.<\/em>, concur.<\/p><\/div>",

JULIANA ALLINGAY, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/>\n<br\/>\nD E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">On February 28, 1907, Domingo Cumagun,\u00a0 the administrator of the estate of the deceased Pedro Cumagun, filed a complaint in the Court of First\u00a0 Instance of Cagayan against Juliana Allingay, alleging: that\u00a0 the\u00a0 said\u00a0 Pedro Cumagun was the owner\u00a0 and in\u00a0 peaceful\u00a0 possession, for many years, of a <i>sementera<\/i> or\u00a0 parcel of rice land inherited from his father and located in the barrio of Macusi,\u00a0 in Penablanca, Cagayan, the situation and boundaries of which are specified in the complaint; that on\u00a0 August 17, 1893, Cumagun gave the said sementera as security to\u00a0 Caspar Mapagu for 25 pesos with the condition that, until this\u00a0 sum should be returned to the creditor Mapagu, the\u00a0 latter\u00a0 might use the land mentioned; that thereupon Mapagu\u00a0 delivered the <i>sementera<\/i> to\u00a0 the\u00a0 spouses Pedro Danguilan and Juliana Allingay for their use, on\u00a0 condition that they deliver to Mapagu a\u00a0 third of the\u00a0 annual crop;\u00a0 that Pedro Cumagun died intestate on January 20, 1895, while he was still the owner of the said <i>sementera,<\/i> which was redeemed on\u00a0 June 3, 1903, by Maxima Cumagun, a\u00a0 sister\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 deceased,\u00a0 who\u00a0 also paid the creditor Mapagu the 25\u00a0 pesos aforementioned; that on November 21, 1905, the\u00a0 plaintiff,\u00a0 Domingo Cumagun, was authorized by the Court of First Instance to administer the estate of the deceased Pedro Cumagun; that the plaintiff, as such administrator, was entitled\u00a0 to the possession of the land\u00a0 in\u00a0 question, but that,\u00a0 notwithstanding his demand made\u00a0 upon the defendant Allingay, in writing,\u00a0 after the redemption of the land and one year prior to the beginning of this suit, to give him possession of the property by reason of its redemption, she refused to turn it over to him; that the defendant was unlawfully holding the sementera in question, and\u00a0 by\u00a0 its\u00a0 detention\u00a0 had occasioned\u00a0 to the\u00a0 plaintiff damages to the amount of P200.\u00a0 The complaint concluded by asking that judgment be rendered in plaintiff's favor by sentencing the defendant to restore to him the said sementera and to pay him P200,\u00a0 the amount of the losses and damages sustained, with the costs.<br\/><br\/>The defendant in her answer\u00a0 denied each and all of the allegations contained\u00a0 in the said complaint, in each and all of its paragraphs.<br\/><br\/>The case having come to trial, the court, after hearing the plaintiff's\u00a0 testimony, rendered judgment on March 6, 1909, in\u00a0 favor\u00a0 of the plaintiff as the\u00a0 administrator of the estate\u00a0 of the deceased\u00a0 Pedro Cumagun, by\u00a0 ordering\u00a0 the defendant, Juliana Allingay, to deliver\u00a0 to him the possession of the aforesaid sementera and to pay him the sum\u00a0 of P127.50, the amount of the damages\u00a0 suffered by the plaintiff by the unlawful detention of\u00a0 the property from December, 1905, to March, 1909.\u00a0\u00a0 The costs were assessed against the defendant. The latter took exception to this judgment and, by a written motion,\u00a0 asked for a new trial on the ground that the\u00a0 findings contained in the\u00a0 judgment were openly and\u00a0 manifestly\u00a0 contrary to\u00a0 the weight of the\u00a0 evidence.\u00a0\u00a0 This motion was denied and an exception was taken by the defendant whose counsel duly presented the proper bill of exceptions which was certified and forwarded to the\u00a0 clerk of this court.<br\/><br\/>This suit concerns the recovery of \"possession of a\u00a0 piece of agricultural land which was delivered, as security\u00a0 for a loan, by\u00a0 the owner of the property, which land\u00a0 is\u00a0 now detained by a tenant on shares of the creditor, although the debt has been fully paid for over a year.<br\/><br\/>The defendant, the widow of the tenant on shares, Pedro Danguilan, in\u00a0 refusing to\u00a0 return the said land alleged that she was the owner of the\u00a0 same by prescription,\u00a0 inasmuch as,\u00a0 in\u00a0 1891, Gaspar Mapagu delivered the\u00a0 property to her said husband,\u00a0 who thereafter\u00a0 had cultivated it as his own and had held\u00a0 it\u00a0 quietly and peacefully for nearly twenty years,\u00a0 and that, for this reason, she and her husband should be declared to\u00a0 be the owners\u00a0 of the land,\u00a0 as they had acquired it\u00a0 by prescription. Besides the fact that the defendant has\u00a0 not, in a satisfactory manner, proven the dominion which\u00a0 it is claimed she and her husband, in his lifetime, exercised\u00a0 over the\u00a0 land in question,, held by them as owners, and the nature of the just title under which the defendant now holds the\u00a0 said property, in the\u00a0 notarial\u00a0 instrument, Exhibit B, it is recorded, as a statement\u00a0 made\u00a0 by Gaspar Mapagu that, as Maxima Cumagun had paid\u00a0 him the\u00a0 sum of\u00a0 25 pesos, borrowed by the\u00a0 owner of the said land, Pedro\u00a0 Cumagun, he returned to the former,\u00a0 on June 3, 1903, the instrument of debt, Exhibit A, and conferred upon her, the said Maxima Cumagun, authority to take charge of the land: referred to, she receiving it from the\u00a0 defendant, Juliana Allingay, the widow of Pedro Danguilan, as the latter were his tenants on shares and raised tobacco and corn on it.<br\/><br\/>This\u00a0 averment,\u00a0 recorded in\u00a0 a\u00a0 notarial\u00a0 instrument\u00a0 and corroborated by other evidence found in the record,\u00a0 does not appear to\u00a0 have been impugned or invalidated by\u00a0 any proof to the contrary, as the defendant produced no evidence of any kind at the trial.<br\/><br\/>Article 1941 of the Civil\u00a0 Code prescribes that possession, one of the requisites under the preceding article, No. 1940; must be in the capacity of an owner, because the possession enjoyed in such capacity alone can serve as a title to\u00a0 acquire ownership,\u00a0 in accordance\u00a0 with the explicit provision of article 447 of the same code, which says:<br\/><blockquote>\"Only the possession acquired and enjoyed by virtue of ownership can serve as a title to acquire it.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>From these\u00a0 legal\u00a0 provisions\u00a0 it is logically deduced that the possession\u00a0 of the lessee, of the trustee, of the pledgee, of the tenant on shares or planter, and of all those who hold in the name or representation\u00a0 of another, can not serve as a basis of prescription, for it is inconceivable that the latter could be\u00a0 based on\u00a0 a\u00a0 possession devoid\u00a0 of the requisites established by law,\u00a0 because it would then become a cloak for fraud and bad faith.<br\/><br\/>The defendant Allingay had, with her deceased husband, Pedro Danguilan, been holding the land in question in the capacity of tenants on shares or planters of Gaspar Mapagu, the usufructuary creditor of Pedro Cumagun, and therefore the possession\u00a0 now enjoyed by the defendant can be in no wise in the capacity of owner; moreover, in\u00a0 refusing to deliver the property to the successor of its legitimate proprietor, she acted in bad faith, with the deceitful intention of appropriating\u00a0 the land to herself without just reason or title.<br\/><br\/>In view of the\u00a0 evidence shown by\u00a0 the record in this case, and\u00a0 no\u00a0 proof\u00a0 to\u00a0 the contrary\u00a0 having been produced,\u00a0 the land in litigation was beyond doubt the property of\u00a0 the deceased Pedro Cumagun, and consequently, his son, the administrator of his estate, was entitled to\u00a0 regain\u00a0\u00a0 its possession\u00a0 from\u00a0 the defendant who, on her part, has\u00a0 not proved that she\u00a0 had any good reason\u00a0 to detain\u00a0 it\u00a0 to\u00a0 the plaintiff's prejudice.<br\/><br\/>Furthermore, the contract guaranteed by the said land, according to Exhibit\u00a0 A, was one of loan, and not of sale with right to repurchase, nor does the frequent use of the word\u00a0 redemption, both\u00a0 in said instrument and\u00a0 in Exhibit B, acknowledging payment of the debt, prove that such a second contract was made, and that the nature of the first was changed, for it was obviously the will and intention of the contracting parties to guarantee, by the land in question, the loan of 20 pesos\u00a0 [25 pesos], without interest, as the creditor was to enjoy the property by\u00a0 having the\u00a0 usufruct thereof.\u00a0\u00a0 Neither were\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant and\u00a0 her deceased husband contracting parties in\u00a0 the alleged contract of sale with right to repurchase, and it has not\u00a0 been disclosed in this suit\u00a0 how and\u00a0 why they received the land from the alleged\u00a0 purchaser\u00a0 in\u00a0 order to legitimately acquire it\u00a0 by prescription.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the\u00a0 identity of the land\u00a0 claimed,\u00a0 this was duly proved at the\u00a0 trial, especially by the documents presented, and is not affected by the error or\u00a0 grave mistake of measurement in the complaint, inasmuch as, according to the provisions of section\u00a0 109 of the Code of Civil\u00a0 Procedure, the facts are found according to the evidence and the action determined by the facts established.<br\/><br\/>As\u00a0 regards the notarial instrument, Exhibit B, its authenticity does not\u00a0 appear to be disputed or impugned by the appellant, and, as such, was admitted\u00a0 by the court, for the objection thereto made by the defendant\u00a0 amounts to the contention that the contents of the said instrument can not be considered as a\u00a0 cancellation of a mortgage; this is true, but\u00a0 the contents of that document are corroboratory proof of the facts set forth in the complaint.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing\u00a0 reasons, and having determined the errors assigned to the judgment appealed from on March 6, 1909, it is proper, in our opinion, to affirm the same, as we hereby do, with\u00a0 the costs against the defendant.<br\/><br\/><i>Mapa, Johnson, Carson,<\/i> and\u00a0 <i>Moreland,\u00a0 JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><\/div>",

I saw a small lesion on his right hand, and a contusion on the left eyebrow.\"<\/blockquote>The trial judge, adopting the testimony of the offended party, qualified the crime as that of lesiones graves, defined and punished under paragraph 2, article 416 of the Penal Code.\u00a0 It does not appear from his decision that he made any personal observations with reference to the condition of the offended party's arm at the time of the trial.<br\/><br\/>Said article 416 reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"He who shall wound, bruise, or maltreat another, shall be punished as guilty of causing serious physical injury:<br\/><br\/><center>*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><\/center> <br\/>\"2.

He himself admits that he was under medical treatment for only eight days, and it is difficult\u00a0 to see why the doctor would have abandoned this treatment and the care of his patient until his arm had been completely cured.<br\/><br\/>Under these facts and circumstances the crime must be qualified as that of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">lesiones menos graves<\/span>, as defined in article 418 of the Penal Code.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is, therefore, reversed, and in the absence of any extenuating or aggravating circumstances the appellant is sentenced to two months and one day of<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> arresto mayor,<\/span> and\u00a0 to pay the costs.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Aragon pleaded guilty.<br\/><br\/>On or about the\u00a0 8th day of July, 1909, V. C. Rissich, a clerk of the firm of W. F. Stevenson &amp; Co., during business hours, was approached by the accused Jose P. de Castro, who, by his representations, induced Rissich to believe that a\u00a0 cargo of 527 sacks of copra\u00a0 was on board the steamer Lucena in Manila Bay, having\u00a0 been sent by one H. Narciso from the Province of Tayabas to\u00a0 one Pedro Narciso in Manila, and that he, Castro,\u00a0 was the said\u00a0 Pedro Narciso.\u00a0 Believing that these representations were\u00a0 true, and that the accused Castro was the owner\u00a0 of\u00a0 said cargo of copra, Rissich,\u00a0 at the request of the said Castro,\u00a0 advanced as a payment upon\u00a0 said cargo the sum of P4,000.\u00a0 During the course of these\u00a0 representations the accused Castro presented to said Rissich a bill of\u00a0 lading of said cargo, completely made out and properly signed,\u00a0\u00a0 This bill\u00a0 of lading entirely corroborated the verbal statements of the accused to\u00a0 Rissich, showing\u00a0 upon its face the facts as the accused had related them.\u00a0 This bill of lading was wholly\u00a0 false and fictitious.\u00a0 The verbal representations made by Castro were wholly false and without any basis of fact whatever.\u00a0 The bill of lading was manufactured and falsified by the accused. As a witness on his own behalf he admitted having made the representations\u00a0 above mentioned and\u00a0 having manufactured or\u00a0 assisted in manufacturing: said bill\u00a0 of lading. He asserted, however,\u00a0 by way of\u00a0 defence,\u00a0 that he\u00a0 was acting entirely in good faith, alleging1 that his coaccused, Aragon, who was a\u00a0 good friend of his, had\u00a0 told him\u00a0 that he, Aragon, had two uncles, H. Narciso and Pedro Narciso, and the one had sent to the other the said cargo\u00a0 of copra and that the same was on board the steamer <i>Lucena<\/i> then lying in Manila Bay, and that the consignee, Pedro Narciso, not being able to reach Manila within a prescribed time, had\u00a0 authorized\u00a0 said\u00a0 Aragon\u00a0 to\u00a0 make\u00a0 the transaction in question for him.\u00a0 The accused Castro further\u00a0 asserted that Aragon asked him to make these misrepresentations as a special favor to him because he, Aragon, was unable to consummate\u00a0 the\u00a0 transaction with W. F. Stevenson &amp; Co. as he was indebted to them in a considerable sum of money.<br\/><br\/>It is\u00a0 apparent that there is in reality no\u00a0 dispute as to the main\u00a0 facts of this case.\u00a0 Substantially the whole defense of\u00a0 the\u00a0 accused is based upon a lack of\u00a0 criminal intention, his counsel asserting that having\u00a0 acted entirely in good faith and upon the\u00a0 honest belief\u00a0 that\u00a0 the\u00a0 representations that\u00a0 he was making\u00a0 were true, he\u00a0 had no intention\u00a0 whatever of injuring\u00a0 anybody or\u00a0 of\u00a0 unlawfully depriving any person of his property.<br\/><br\/>The learned trial court found himself entirely unable to believe this story, stating in the opinion which forms the basis of his judgment of conviction that the defendant is a man of sufficient intelligence to understand\u00a0 right from wrong, he being a man\u00a0 of education, experience and capacity;\u00a0 and that even if he were deceived at the beginning, he must necessarily have learned the truth before the fraud was consummated, at which time, if he had been an honest man, he would\u00a0 have denounced his friend and prevented the fraud.\"\u00a0 Moreover, asserts the learned trial court, even if he did not find out the fraud before it was\u00a0 consummated, he certainly must have learned\u00a0 it between the\u00a0 time of its consummation and the date of his arrest, a period extending over about two months, at which time he was morally and legally under the obligation to denounce the transaction and to save the situation as far as he could.\u00a0 He did nothing of the kind;\u00a0 but, rather, took a portion of the money thus obtained and proceeded to spend it in riotous living. These circumstances, taken\u00a0 in connection with the fact that the accused\u00a0 Castro, when arrested,\u00a0 at\u00a0 first denied having taken any part\u00a0 whatever in the transaction, indicated to the learned trial court that he had full knowledge of the aim\u00a0 and purpose thereof.<br\/><br\/>Upon the proofs we have no\u00a0 doubt whatever of the guilt of the appellant.\u00a0 The learned trial court properly and correctly weighed the evidence.\u00a0\u00a0 The transaction was a bold and\u00a0 criminal fraud, practiced\u00a0 in a\u00a0 high-handed manner, and\u00a0 fully deserved the condemnation which it received at the hands of the court below.<br\/><br\/>The information alleges and the proofs show that the appellant in this case\u00a0 committed two distinct crimes, one of <i>estafa,<\/i> defined and punished under subdivision 1, article 535, of the Penal\u00a0 Code, and the crime of falsification of a private\u00a0 document, defined and punished in article 304 of said code.\u00a0 Inasmuch, however,\u00a0 as the one crime was a necessary means of committing the other,\u00a0 the\u00a0 accused can not be punished for both offenses.\u00a0 Under the provisions of article 89\u00a0 of the Penal Code, he must be punished in the maximum degree of the\u00a0 more\u00a0 serious crime.\u00a0\u00a0 Falsification of\u00a0 a\u00a0 private document is the more serious of the two inasmuch as it is punished not only by <i>presidio correccional<\/i> in its\u00a0 minimum\u00a0 and medium degrees, as estafa is punished, but also by a fine of from 625 to 6,250\u00a0 pesetas. The\u00a0 maximum\u00a0 degree\u00a0 of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">presidio correctional<\/span> in its minimum and\u00a0 medium degrees\u00a0 is\u00a0 from 2 years 11\u00a0 months and\u00a0 11 days to 4 years and\u00a0 two\u00a0 months.\u00a0 The\u00a0 penalty imposed by the learned trial\u00a0 court is, therefore,\u00a0 within the law.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of conviction is affirmed, with costs against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i> Arellano, C.

McCabe presiding, dismissing the\u00a0 plaintiff's complaint upon\u00a0 the merits after trial with\u00a0 costs.<p>The action is\u00a0 one of ejectment.\u00a0 It appears that on the 16th day of August, 1904, one Esteban Vazquez y Decena, upon\u00a0 the one hand, and Pedro\u00a0 Yulo, upon\u00a0 the other, executed an instrument which, translated, reads as follows:<\/p><p align=\"center\"> \"DEFENDANT'S EXHIBIT 2.<\/p><p>\"I,\u00a0 Esteban Vazquez y Decena, a native of Ymamaylan, 60 years of age, married, a farmer by occupation, and a resident of the town of Hinigaran on the west coast of the Island of Negros, hereby make known that, in consideration of\u00a0 the sum of P250, received by me from Pedro Yulo y Regalado, a resident of Binalbagan, of legal age, with certificate of registration No. 710982, issued by the municipal treasurer of said town, and\u00a0 which said amount received by\u00a0 me as aforesaid was thus received in payment of a frame house belonging to me, as appears from the summary information heretofore instituted ; it is bounded on\u00a0 the north by\u00a0 a public street for 12 <em>brazas<\/em>; on the west by a public street and the\u00a0 lands of Lucio Tansiua and Juan Vasquez, being1 14 <em>brazas <\/em>deep on the street line and bounded by the crossing street; on the left the property measures 7 <em>brazas<\/em>, the measurements on plan being at right angles, and the house, which is of strong material, is covered with galvanized iron roofing.<\/p><p>\"I\u00a0 further make known\u00a0 that the house above described, and located in the town of Hinigaran, I have this day sold with\u00a0 right of redemption\u00a0 within the\u00a0 period of 6\u00a0 months from date and for the said sum of 250 pesos conant or Philippine currency to\u00a0 Mr. Pedro Yulo; that is to say, that I may repurchase the property on the last day of the period herein stipulated, but, after the lapse of said\u00a0 period, the transfer and sale of the said house for the aforesaid amount shall be final; but if I am able to redeem the property within the time herein stipulated, then the vendee shall make the necessary receipt and this\u00a0 instrument\u00a0 shall be accordingly cancelled.<\/p><p>\"I\u00a0 further make known that for the said\u00a0 period\u00a0 of 6 months herein before stipulated I have leased the said house for the sum of\u00a0 30 pesos conant, all taxes and repairs to be borne by me.<\/p><p>\"I further make known that I hereby covenant and agree with\u00a0 Esteban Vazquez, who\u00a0 is the absolute owner of the house in question, that I will guarantee the sale, and further hold myself responsible to the said vendee, Mr. Yulo, his heirs\u00a0 and assigns, for the ownership and title to the said property, which I hereby promise to defend now and forever against any just claim which may be made against same. \"Pedro Yulo,\u00a0 the vendee, was present and accepted, in their entirety, the terms of this instrument as hereinbefore set out by Mr. Vazquez.<\/p><p>\"In witness whereof, we have signed these presents at Binalbagan this\u00a0 16th day of August, 1904.\u00a0 <\/p><table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" style=\"width: 521px;

that the time within which the property could have\u00a0 been\u00a0 repurchased or redeemed by\u00a0 said Vazquez\u00a0 y Decena, by the\u00a0 payment of the sum of P250 and interest, expired on the 12th day of February, 1905; that Esteban Vazquez y Decena did not, during said period, repurchase the said property or pay the sum set forth in said instrument, with\u00a0 interest thereon, within the\u00a0 time prescribed by the terms\u00a0 of said document,\u00a0 and for that reason the title\u00a0 became absolute in Pedro Yulo on the expiration of the\u00a0 last day of said term; that the sale from Pedro Yulo to Joaquin Villadelgado, one of the defendants in this\u00a0 case,\u00a0 was an absolute sale legally perfect in every respect and\u00a0 binding upon Esteban\u00a0 Vazquez y Decena as well as upon Pedro Yulo\u00a0 and\u00a0 Joaquin Villadelgado; that by reason thereof the sale of said premises to Pedro Vazquez\u00a0 by Esteban Vazquez\u00a0 y Decena on the 5th day of January, 1907, was ineffective, the\u00a0 vendor having, at the time, no interest to transfer.<\/p><p>It is the claim of the plaintiff in this action (1) that the instrument executed between Esteban Vazquez y Decena and Pedro Yulo is not a <em>pacto\u00a0 de retro<\/em> in the\u00a0 legal sense and carries none of the legal consequences which accompany such an instrument; (2) that, even though said\u00a0 instrument is a sale with the right of repurchase, nevertheless, and as a\u00a0 matter of\u00a0 fact, said Esteban Vazquez y Decena in the month of January,\u00a0 1905,\u00a0 and prior\u00a0 to the termination of the period fixed by said instrument, paid\u00a0 to Pedro Yulo the sum of P370 in full settlement of the obligation created by said instrument, and by such payment said instrument, of whatever\u00a0 nature, was\u00a0 canceled and became ineffective and the\u00a0 interest which Pedro\u00a0 Yulo had in\u00a0 the house in question by virtue thereof ceased.<\/p><p>The\u00a0 plaintiff\u00a0 contends\u00a0 that\u00a0 his\u00a0 proofs\u00a0 show that\u00a0 the payment of the\u00a0 said sum of P370\u00a0 was made by Esteban Vazquez y Decena through his\u00a0 son Antipas Vazquez; that during the month of January, 1905, and for some time prior thereto, said Antipas Vazquez and Pedro Yulo had an open and current account between them,\u00a0 representing business dealings\u00a0 of some magnitude; that in said\u00a0 month of January, 1905, Pedro Yulo, at the request of Antipas Vazquez, charged to the\u00a0 account of\u00a0 Antipas\u00a0 Vazquez the sum\u00a0 of P370\u00a0 and\u00a0 credited\u00a0 that\u00a0 amount\u00a0 upon the\u00a0 indebtedness created by the instrument already referred to executed between\u00a0 Esteban Vazquez y Decena and Pedro Yulo, thereby paying the same in full; that said instrument was by Antipas Vazquez demanded\u00a0 of\u00a0 said Pedro Yulo at the time of such payment;\u00a0 that he failed to produce it, alleging as the reason for said\u00a0 failure that the instrument had been mislaid and could\u00a0 not be\u00a0 found; that several times thereafter the instrument was demanded by\u00a0 Esteban Vazquez y Decena and each\u00a0 time\u00a0 its\u00a0 delivery was withheld, Yulo presenting the same excuse as at\u00a0 first; that the action of Joaquin\u00a0 Villadelgado against Esteban\u00a0 Vazquez y\u00a0 Decena, above\u00a0 referred to, having been begun\u00a0 on the 24th day of April,\u00a0 1907, Esteban Vazquez y Decena again, and on\u00a0 the 30th day of April,\u00a0 1907, through his son Antipas, requested the immediate delivery\u00a0 of said instrument for\u00a0 his protection in the action\u00a0 referred to and\u00a0 demanded\u00a0 to know why such action had been commenced; that\u00a0 Pedro Yulo assured Antipas\u00a0 that his father need not be troubled over the\u00a0 action referred to, as it would amount to nothing, and, upon the request of Antipas, in order to quiet\u00a0 the fears of\u00a0 Esteban,\u00a0 delivered to him a paper duly\u00a0 signed by him\u00a0 for presentation as a defense in said action, stating again that he was unable\u00a0 to\u00a0 deliver\u00a0 the original\u00a0 instrument for\u00a0 the reason that it could not be found; he assured him, however, that the\u00a0 paper which he then delivered would be sufficient protection against\u00a0 the action\u00a0 of Villadelgado.<\/p><p>The\u00a0 plaintiff has presented several witnesses.\u00a0 Antipas Vazquez\u00a0 testified substantially, to the facts\u00a0 as above related. As a witness he asserted that,\u00a0 during the month of January, 1905, and for some time prior thereto, he had had a running, open and current account with Pedro Yulo; that at the same time he also had\u00a0 an account with his father, Esteban\u00a0 Vazquez\u00a0 y\u00a0 Decena; that during the month\u00a0 of January he made a settlement with his father which showed that there was due\u00a0 to\u00a0 his father\u00a0 from him the\u00a0 sum\u00a0 of P1,520; that his father requested that he liquidate the said sum by paying P370 to Pedro Yulo in satisfaction of\u00a0 the obligation contained in the so-called\u00a0 <em>pacto\u00a0 de retro<\/em>, and that he pay the balance to Pedro Vazquez, to whom he, Esteban Vazquez y Decena, was then owing a\u00a0 considerable sum of money;\u00a0 that he thereupon, and during the same month, called upon Pedro Yulo in relation to the payment of the sum due on\u00a0 said instrument and that, having agreed thereto, Pedro Yulo charged the\u00a0 said sum of\u00a0 P370 to his account in discharge of said obligation; that he demanded possession of\u00a0 the\u00a0 instrument in\u00a0 question at\u00a0 the time\u00a0 of said payment\u00a0 but\u00a0 it was withheld by Pedro Yulo\u00a0 on the ground that he was unable to find it; that thereafter Esteban Vazquez, Jr., a brother of\u00a0 the witness,\u00a0 was sent to obtain said instrument\u00a0 from Pedro Yulo, but\u00a0 his demand was as fruitless as had been that of the witness; that, after the commencement of the action against his father by Joaquin Villadelgado\u00a0 and\u00a0 on the 30th day of April, 1907,\u00a0 he again visited Pedro Yulo for the\u00a0 purpose of obtaining the instrument as a defense to said\u00a0 action; that\u00a0 he received the same excuse as before for its nondelivery; that he thereupon requested from Pedro Yulo some writing which would indicate the discharge\u00a0 of said obligation and which might be presented as a defense to said action in place of the lost instrument; that thereupon Pedro Yulo\u00a0 wrote and signed a paper for the purposes indicated and delivered it to Antipas\u00a0 Vazquez on behalf of his father.\u00a0 This testimony of Antipas Vazquez is supported and fully corroborated\u00a0 by the testimony of Esteban Vazquez y\u00a0 Decena and Esteban Vazquez, Jr.<\/p><p>The witness Jose Robles testified that in\u00a0 the month of January, 1905, he was present at the settlement which took place between Esteban Vazquez y Decena and\u00a0 his son Antipas Vazquez;\u00a0 and that such settlement disclosed\u00a0 that Antipas Vazquez was\u00a0 owing to his father about P1,500; that at that time Antipas Vazquez agreed with his father that he would pay to Pedro Yulo the sum of P370 on behalf of his father\u00a0 for\u00a0 the discharge of the obligation already referred to, and that the remainder of the sum due from him to his father he would pay to Pedro Vazquez on the indebtedness of his father to the latter.<\/p><p>Pedro Vazquez corroborated the testimony presented to show the agreement between Esteban Vazquez y Decena and Antipas Vazquez by testifying that\u00a0 Antipas Vazquez, in pursuance of his agreement with his father,\u00a0 paid him a considerable sum of money, something like P800, upon the indebtedness due him from Esteban Vazquez y Decena.<\/p><p>Pedro Yulo was the only witness for the defense who testified concerning the execution of the instrument between himself and Esteban Vazquez\u00a0 y Decena and in relation to the alleged payment of the obligation created by said instrument.\u00a0 He\u00a0 denied that Esteban\u00a0 Vazquez,\u00a0 by himself or by\u00a0 his agent, ever attempted to satisfy\u00a0 the obligation created by such instrument, and asserted that\u00a0 the paper which\u00a0 he, at the request\u00a0 of Antipas\u00a0 Vazquez,\u00a0 signed\u00a0 and delivered on the 30th day of April,\u00a0 1907, on behalf of Esteban Vazquez y Decena, was\u00a0 simply\u00a0 a vale\u00a0 or promissory note which,\u00a0 for want of P370 in cash, he gave\u00a0 to Antipas Vazquez as a loan.\u00a0 He denied that Antipas Vazquez\u00a0 ever demanded of him the instrument in question, and contradicted\u00a0 the assertion that Esteban Vazquez, Jr.,\u00a0 made\u00a0 such demand.\u00a0 He testified\u00a0 that Antipas Vazquez came to him to request his intervention to\u00a0 induce\u00a0 Joaquin Villadelgado to permit the redemption of the house after the action had been begun by said Villadelgado against\u00a0 Esteban Vazquez y Decena for the possession of the same, and that together they went to see Joaquin Villadelgado\u00a0 to that end and\u00a0 that the latter refused to permit such redemption.\u00a0 Villadelgado does not corroborate this testimony.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The defense presents no witness supporting the testimony\u00a0 of\u00a0 Pedro Yulo with respect to the payment, or the nonpayment, of the debt due him\u00a0 from Esteban Vazquez y\u00a0 Decena. In this respect he stands alone.\u00a0 The plaintiff, in corroboration of the testimony of Esteban Vazquez y Decena, Antipas Vazquez and Esteban\u00a0 Vazquez, jr.,\u00a0 presents in\u00a0 evidence\u00a0 certain documents.\u00a0 One\u00a0 of\u00a0 them, Exhibit A,\u00a0 is\u00a0 a statement of\u00a0 the current account between Antipas Vazquez and Pedro Yulo, signed by both of them.\u00a0 On the third page of that account there appears this charge against Antipas Vazquez:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>1907, April 30.\u00a0 Pdo. a E.

He asserts that it might, if not would, be regarded as a receipt executed by Pedro Yulo for the sum of P370 paid to him by Antipas Vazquez.\u00a0 In support of such argument he\u00a0 recurs to that entry of the account between\u00a0 Pedro Yulo and Antipas Vazquez above quoted which shows that the said sum of P370 instead of being paid to Antipas Vazquez was in reality charged to Antipas Vazquez and paid or\u00a0 credited to Esteban\u00a0 Vazquez y\u00a0 Decena,\u00a0 his father.\u00a0\u00a0 In\u00a0 other\u00a0 words, it is contended that\u00a0 if defendant's construction of the so-called <em>vale<\/em> is maintained, then that document is in material contradiction of the entry made in the account, inasmuch as said vale, as construed by the defendant, asserts a payment made to\u00a0 Antipas Vazquez, while the entry made by Pedro Yulo in his account against Antipas Vazquez shows a charge against Antipas Vazquez for that amount and payment or credit\u00a0 of said sum to the father.\u00a0 It is conceded that the vale and the entry in the account refer\u00a0 to the same sum and to the same transaction.\u00a0 The learned trial court in the decision of the case accepted the construction for which the defendant contended.\u00a0 He says:<\/p><p>\"It is the contention of the plaintiff that this <em>vale<\/em>, Exhibit B, is in reality a receipt\u00a0 from Pedro Yulo, showing that the repurchase price on this house had been paid.\u00a0 If this amount had been paid to Pedro Yulo\u00a0 in January, 1905, or Antipas Vazquez\u00a0 had assumed the indebtedness at that time, this court is unable to understand\u00a0 why\u00a0 it\u00a0 does not show in\u00a0 Exhibit A for the year 1905,\u00a0 or why he did not charge himself at\u00a0 that time with the amount.\u00a0 There is nothing on\u00a0 the face of\u00a0 this <em>vale<\/em> given\u00a0 April 30,\u00a0 1907, which\u00a0 would indicate that\u00a0 it is a\u00a0 receipt given by Pedro Yulo for money paid him, nor\u00a0 is there anything over the signature of Pedro Yulo\u00a0 on this vale, Exhibit B, showing that it referred in\u00a0 any way to the house\u00a0 or to matters relating to Esteban Vazquez.\u00a0\u00a0 Pedro Yulo testifying for the defendant says\u00a0 that there was an account current existing between him and Antipas Vazquez, and that on April 30, 1907, Antipas Vazquez came\u00a0 to him\u00a0 and\u00a0 said that he was indebted\u00a0 to his father P370, and wanted to borrow from him the amount.\u00a0 Yulo testifies that he told Antipas Vazquez that he would give him a vale for that amount which he could negotiate or cash, and\u00a0 then pay his father.\u00a0 Yulo says that he did this and that he executed\u00a0 this vale, Exhibit B, and gave it\u00a0 to Antipas Vazquez.\u00a0 This vale\u00a0 as appears according to the writing thereon was on this same day indorsed by Antipas Vazquez over to his father, Esteban.\u00a0\u00a0 It must be remembered that this vale was given on\u00a0 the 30th of April, 1907, which\u00a0 was six days after\u00a0 Joaquin\u00a0 Villadelgado had commenced his suit against Esteban Vazquez for the recovery of this\u00a0 house.<\/p><p>\"Now it appears to this court that had this money been paid to Pedro Yulo and this house repurchased prior to this time, and that they wanted a receipt from him\u00a0 showing that fact as a defense against\u00a0 the claim of Joaquin Villadelgado, they would\u00a0 have worded it different from the way this vale was worded, and\u00a0 that they\u00a0 would have\u00a0 secured from Yulo a statement in writing showing that the repurchase price of the\u00a0 house had\u00a0 been paid him,\u00a0 instead of having him give\u00a0 a vale, which has nothing upon\u00a0 the face of it connecting it with the house transaction.<\/p><p>\"It is\u00a0 a very common\u00a0 practice in the Philippine Islands for business men, when they desire to\u00a0 make an advance to the parties carrying on business with them, and they have no money on hand,\u00a0 to give\u00a0 a\u00a0 vale in the form that this Exhibit B is written,\u00a0 which the party receiving can take and negotiate with others who are willing to advance the money upon\u00a0 it.\u00a0\u00a0 This\u00a0 is frequently done\u00a0 where the party giving the vale is a man of good standing and some wealth, as is\u00a0 the case with Pedro Yulo.<\/p><p>\"This <em>vale<\/em>, as it is written, is one that Esteban\u00a0 Vazquez or his father could\u00a0 probably have taken and negotiated. Certainly there is nothing about it to indicate that Pedro Yulo merely gave it as a\u00a0 receipt for money paid him.\u00a0 Neither is there anything in Exhibit A of the plaintiff which would indicate that.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the other hand,\u00a0 Exhibit A shows that Antipas Vazquez\u00a0 had charged this on\u00a0 his account as an amount due from him to Pedro Yulo, having charged\u00a0 it in his debit account.\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"The court is of the opinion that the statement given by Pedro Yulo regarding the transaction of the giving of this vale is the true version of the affair.\u00a0 Another thing should be remembered, that if this repurchase price of the house had really been paid in\u00a0 January, 1905, it would not have amounted to P370, and if it was paid in April, 1907, it would not be P370, but would be at least P410, providing the rent of P5 per month had been continued; and yet again is it true that if this Exhibit B was given by Pedro Yulo on April 30th, 1907, as a receipt showing that this\u00a0 property had been repurchased or redeemed by Esteban Vazquez, it would not affect the rights of Joaquin Villadelgado who had purchased\u00a0 the property from Pedro\u00a0 Yulo on\u00a0 February 12, 1906.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>As is evident, this finding of the court\u00a0 is based almost entirely upon the wording\u00a0 of the so-called vale, Exhibit B, the court holding that there is nothing in that instrument indicating that it is a receipt for the sum of P370, or that it was intended as such.\u00a0 We are aware of the strength of the contention that Exhibit B takes the ordinary form of a <em>vale<\/em>, or I O U; as used in certain localities in the Philippine Islands.\u00a0\u00a0 We\u00a0 have not overlooked,\u00a0 either, the fact that the entry in Exhibit A, the account between Antipas Vazquez and Pedro Yulo, is, in a sense, a corroborate on of the construction given by the court to Exhibit A, the charge in said account being, in\u00a0 a manner,\u00a0 consistent\u00a0 with the assertion that Exhibit B was a loan of credit instead of a receipt for money paid.\u00a0\u00a0 It must not be forgotten, however, that, while\u00a0 the finding of\u00a0 the court referred to has some support in\u00a0 said documentary proof,\u00a0 there still remain some features of those documents inconsistent with that finding. In the first place,\u00a0 there\u00a0 is no substantial reason why the name of Esteban Vazquez\u00a0 y Decena should appear in the charge\u00a0 against Antipas Vazquez in Exhibit A.\u00a0\u00a0 It is,\u00a0 as already stated, the contention of defendant that the loan was made to Antipas Vazquez and that he was charged with that amount.\u00a0\u00a0 Esteban Vazquez y\u00a0 Decena\u00a0 had no\u00a0 part whatever\u00a0 in the transaction.\u00a0\u00a0 Under\u00a0 such contention, it was the concern of nobody, least of\u00a0 all Yulo, what Antipas did with the money or with the vale which he was to negotiate for money.\u00a0 Speaking from the\u00a0 ordinary\u00a0 point\u00a0 of view, if the transaction did not concern Esteban Vazquez y Decena, his name would not have appeared in it.\u00a0\u00a0 The ordinary and\u00a0 natural\u00a0 entry made on the\u00a0 transaction as presented and\u00a0 interpreted by Yulo would have been as follows:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>April 30, 1907.\u00a0 To vale issued for negotiation........................ P370.00<\/p><\/blockquote><p>If a fuller\u00a0 statement\u00a0 of the transaction\u00a0 were deemed advisable, the entry might read:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>April 30, 1907. To money loaned by vale of even date herewith\u00a0 P370.00<\/p><\/blockquote><p>There was no call for\u00a0 the insertion\u00a0 of the name of Esteban Vazquez y\u00a0 Decena in\u00a0 any entry properly and\u00a0 correctly representing the transaction as interpreted by Yulo. Either of the\u00a0 entries above indicated would have given a clear and complete history of the transaction and the return of the vale to Yulo for payment after it had been negotiated by Antipas or his father would have been complete proof of the verity of such entry.\u00a0 The use\u00a0 of the name of Esteban Vazquez y Decena\u00a0 in the\u00a0 entry indicates, if it does not prove, that he was materially concerned in the transaction between Yulo and\u00a0 Antipas,\u00a0 so much concerned indeed that, according to Yulo's\u00a0 appreciation of the situation, the entry would not be complete or correct without mentioning his name.<\/p><p>Moreover, in determining the correctness of the finding which we are\u00a0 discussing, we must do so not only in the light of the instruments themselves, but also in plain view of all the circumstances preceding, surrounding and following their execution.\u00a0\u00a0 There are certain facts which, while they do not bear directly on the construction to be given to\u00a0 the instruments\u00a0 in\u00a0 question, are,\u00a0 nevertheless, so intimately connected with it that they have,\u00a0 in our opinion, a strong\u00a0 influence.\u00a0 It\u00a0 should be noted that the value of the house which Pedro Yulo alleges he purchased for P250 was variously\u00a0 estimated from P2,000 to P14,000, P2,000 being the value set\u00a0 by\u00a0 Pedro Yulo himself, and seven or eight thousand pesos being the value set by disinterested witnesses.\u00a0 We are\u00a0 inclined\u00a0 to\u00a0 believe that\u00a0 a fair value of the house, according to the evidence, was about ?6,000. It is\u00a0 evident, therefore, that, according to Yulo's contention,\u00a0 Esteban Vazquez y Decena was likely to lose a house valued at P6,000, for want of the sum of P250, with interest and charges; that Esteban Vazquez y Decena, knowing that fact, nevertheless, permitted the expiration of the time\u00a0 stipulated\u00a0 in\u00a0 the so-called\u00a0 yacto de retro,\u00a0 not\u00a0 only without making\u00a0 any effort whatever to pay the sum therein stipulated but also without so much as a request to Pedro Yulo for an extension of the time specified.\u00a0 It is hard to believe that\u00a0 a person\u00a0 of ordinary intelligence\u00a0 and\u00a0 comprehension would thus remain quiet and inactive with the full knowledge that he was losing a valuable home for want of a sum amounting to about one-thirtieth of\u00a0 its value. It is difficult for us\u00a0 to believe that such a thing actually occurred.\u00a0 It is\u00a0 a necessary conclusion from all\u00a0 the\u00a0 facts and\u00a0 circumstances of\u00a0 the case\u00a0 that\u00a0 Esteban Vazquez\u00a0 y Decena\u00a0 either did not regard the instrument executed between him and\u00a0 Pedro Yulo as a pacto de retro\u00a0 or else he firmly believed\u00a0 that\u00a0 he had\u00a0 redeemed\u00a0 the\u00a0 house\u00a0 from the operation of that instrument.\u00a0 If he honestly believed, as his actions indicate,\u00a0 that he had paid the sum required of him\u00a0 to satisfy the obligation imposed upon the house, then it is\u00a0 certain that if Exhibit B had any connection whatever with the so-called pacto de retro, that instrument was not a vale but was\u00a0 in the nature of a receipt for the payment of the sum of P250\u00a0 and accrued interest and charges and was, in effect, a cancellation\u00a0 of the instrument containing that obligation.\u00a0 Every act of Esteban Vazquez\u00a0 y Decena preceding the execution of Exhibit B indicates that he fully believed that the obligation subsisting against the house in question had been paid and discharged.\u00a0 He maintained possession of the house after the expiration of the time stipulated in the so-called <em>pacto de retro<\/em>\u00a0 and, after such expiration, paid absolutely\u00a0 no rent to\u00a0 Pedro\u00a0 Yulo.\u00a0 Although\u00a0 it appears undisputed in the record and is a conceded fact\u00a0 in this case that Pedro Yulo claimed to own the house in question for almost a year after he claims to have become\u00a0 the owner of it, nevertheless, Esteban Vazquez y Decena, during all that year, paid not a cent of rent, nor\u00a0 was he required or even requested to do so by Pedro Yulo or anyone in his\u00a0 behalf.\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, not only did\u00a0 he occupy the house without rent for its use and occupation, but\u00a0 he also paid the rent for the\u00a0 ground upon which\u00a0 the house stood, just as he\u00a0 had done from the time of its erection.\u00a0 At no time prior to the\u00a0 execution of Exhibit\u00a0 B by Pedro Yulo did Esteban Vazquez y Decena perform\u00a0 a single act which did not have as its necessary basis the beJief that the obligation imposed\u00a0 by the so-called <em>pacto de retro<\/em> had been paid and discharged.\u00a0 Precisely the same thing may be said as to his acts and conduct at the time of and after the execution of Exhibit B, the so-called <em>vale.<\/em>\u00a0 This\u00a0 instrument was by Antipas Vazquez delivered to his father immediately\u00a0 after its receipt from Pedro Yulo.\u00a0 He took it into his\u00a0 possession and there it\u00a0 remained.\u00a0 Although it is claimed\u00a0 by Pedro Yulo that\u00a0 said vale was executed by him as a loan to Antipas Vazquez to pay a debt to his father, yet said instrument was kept in the possession of Esteban Vazquez y Decena\u00a0 without using it in any manner whatever, so far\u00a0 as appears of record, except as a safeguard against being dispossessed of the house in which he lived. Although so\u00a0 straitened financially\u00a0 that\u00a0 he\u00a0 could not pay 370 to save a P6,000 house, or pay a debt which he owed to Pedro Vazquez, without the intervention and aid of his son, of pay various other demands the payment of which, it is alleged in defendant's brief, he sought to escape, still it is asserted by the\u00a0 defense that he took and kept in his possession an\u00a0 instrument upon which he\u00a0 would have been able\u00a0 to raise the sum of P370 by mere negotiation, without obtaining the money which he so much needed.\u00a0 The question \"Why did not Esteban Vazquez y Decena negotiate the vale, if he understood it to be a loan, instead of holding it in his\u00a0 possession?\"\u00a0 is unanswered by the defense.\u00a0 That Esteban Vazquez y Decena should remain quiet and tranquil through\u00a0 the\u00a0 period of three years without any attempt whatever to redeem his property from loss is unbelievable. That\u00a0 he\u00a0 received\u00a0 the\u00a0 so-called\u00a0 vale\u00a0 to\u00a0 negotiate for\u00a0 his necessities and then kept it for\u00a0 years without doing so is, under all the circumstances of this\u00a0 case, almost\u00a0 equally unbelievable.\u00a0\u00a0 Again, knowing that he had\u00a0 not\u00a0 redeemed the house within the time prescribed by the so-called <em>pacto de retro<\/em>\u00a0 and knowing, therefore, that it was forever lost to him, nevertheless, he lived quietly\u00a0 in\u00a0 said premises for one year and\u00a0 three months after said house had become the property of Pedro Yulo, paying rent\u00a0 to nobody, except the ground rent to Juana Guanzon, and\u00a0 eventually quietly and tranquilly selling it free and clear from all\u00a0 liens\u00a0 and incumbrances\u00a0 to the plaintiff in this action for the sum of P4,300.\u00a0 When the two\u00a0 actions for\u00a0 the\u00a0 possession of the premises\u00a0 were brought against him\u00a0 by Joaquin Villadelgado, one on the 24th\u00a0 of April, 1907, in\u00a0 the\u00a0 Court of First\u00a0 Instance, and the other on the 23d of May, 1908, before the justice of the peace of Hinigaran, he permitted both actions to go by\u00a0 default upon the belief,\u00a0 evidently, that he had theretofore sold the property to the plaintiff in this case and that an action against him would accomplish no result, he having no interest in the premises.\u00a0\u00a0 This conduct, probably unpremeditated and undesigned, indicates the belief that the property had been legally transferred free from incumbrance to Pedro Vazquez, a necessary precedent to which\u00a0 was\u00a0 the\u00a0 discharge\u00a0 of\u00a0 the obligation\u00a0 of the so-called <em>pacto de retro.<\/em> Not only does the conduct\u00a0 of Esteban Vazquez y Decena and Antipas Vazquez show the interpretation which they placed upon Exhibit B,\u00a0 but also the conduct of Pedro Yulo and Joaquin Villadelgado demonstrates to our minds with fair conclusiveness\u00a0 that they also interpreted Exhibit B in the same manner. We\u00a0 call again to mind\u00a0 the fact that Pedro Yulo collected the rent of P2.50 from Esteban Vazquez y Decena\u00a0 for each month during\u00a0 the six months prescribed in the\u00a0 so-called pacto de retro.\u00a0 We recall the fact that after the\u00a0 expiration of said six\u00a0 months Pedro Yulo not only did not receive further rent from Esteban Vazquez y Decena but did not demand any.\u00a0 Although he claims to\u00a0 have been the absolute\u00a0 owner of the house\u00a0 from the 16th day of February, 1905, to the 12th of February, 1906, when he sold it to Joaquin ViUadelgado, nevertheless, it is undisputed in this case that he did not receive any consideration\u00a0 whatever for the use of said premises by Esteban Vazquez y Decena, and that he did not demand anything for such use.\u00a0 Not only did he not collect the rent or demand it,\u00a0 but he made no overtures upon the subject of the rent of\u00a0 the house to Esteban Vazquez y Decena and communicated with him in no way as to the claims or rights under which he was occupying.\u00a0 Instead of the conduct which we\u00a0 would\u00a0 ordinarily expect of Pedro\u00a0 Yulo\u00a0 under these circumstances, we find him, without word or sign to Esteban Vazquez y Decena, quietly, if not secretly, selling said house to one of the defendants in this action, Joaquin Villadelgado, by document not publicly executed or registered in any public office.<\/p><p>In this connection the price at which Pedro YuJo sold the house to Joaquin Villadelgado must not be overlooked.\u00a0 As we have already observed, it was worth, according to the evidence, at least P6,000.\u00a0 Yet we find\u00a0 Pedro\u00a0 Yulo giving this testimony before the Court of First Instance\u00a0 on the trial of this action:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"Q. What was the price you received for the sale of the house to Mr. Villadelgado? - A. ?300 plus the interest.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"Court\u00a0 (addressing\u00a0 witness).\u00a0 And\u00a0 you sold a house worth P2,000 for P300.\u00a0 Did you sell a house worth F2,000 belonging to you for P300?\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"Witness. Yes, sir.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p align=\"center\">COURT CONTINUING EXAMINATION OP WITNESS.<\/p><blockquote><p>\"Q. And you are a business man? - A. Besides the house the other document was included too.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"Q. How much did you get for that document? - A. In the two documents P1,200.<\/p><p>\"Q. Well,\u00a0 but that other document\u00a0 had no lien on the house, had it? - A. No sir, it was a different one.<\/p><p>\"Q. So you\u00a0 actually sold the house\u00a0 for\u00a0 P300? - A.\u00a0 Yes sir.<\/p><p>\"Q. Well, now, explain to me why is it you sold a house worth P2,000\u00a0 for P300? - A.\u00a0 I sold this house for P300 because\u00a0 Mr.\u00a0 Villadelgado assumed\u00a0 to pay me the value of the other document which is more than this.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>In explanation of some portions of this\u00a0 evidence it should be stated that\u00a0 Pedro Yulo\u00a0 himself testified that the value of the house was P2,000, and it is claimed by him that, when he sold\u00a0 the\u00a0 house for P300,\u00a0 Joaquin\u00a0 Villadelgado\u00a0 guaranteed the payment of a certain other obligation which Yulo held against Esteban Vazquez y Decena.\u00a0 It should also be stated that, according to the evidence, Villadelgado has already collected from Esteban Vazquez y Decena considerably more than half of the amount of the obligation the payment of which he is\u00a0 claimed to have\u00a0 secured.\u00a0 It is evident, therefore,\u00a0 that the\u00a0 obligation\u00a0 under which\u00a0 Villadelgado placed himself to Pedro Yulo as a part of the purchase price of said house is, to say\u00a0 the\u00a0 most, a very small one and\u00a0 one which is, at the most, uncertain.\u00a0\u00a0 The whole purchase price of\u00a0 the house, obligation and all, could not exceed six or seven hundred pesos, and in making\u00a0 this estimate we are,\u00a0 we believe, giving\u00a0 to the defense the benefit of\u00a0 every possible\u00a0 assumption\u00a0 favorable to\u00a0 it.\u00a0\u00a0 We have, then, a house which\u00a0 Pedro Yulo himself\u00a0 in his\u00a0 testimony values at P2,000 and\u00a0 which is worth, as\u00a0 we\u00a0 have said, at least P6,000, sold for not more than one-tenth of its value.\u00a0 Tnis is a\u00a0 fact which,\u00a0 as appears from the evidence\u00a0 quoted, so astonished the\u00a0 court\u00a0 as to lead him personally to direct a series of questions to\u00a0 Yulo apparently for the purpose of ascertaining\u00a0 whether or not he had made a\u00a0 slip in\u00a0 the use of language,\u00a0 once making such an assertion\u00a0 not being sufficient to convince the court that\u00a0 a declaration so incredible was intended.\u00a0 That under normal\u00a0 conditions\u00a0 Pedro Yulo, a shrewd and\u00a0 careful business man, should voluntarily sell a house valued at P6,000 for one-tenth of its value is unreasonable.\u00a0 It is\u00a0 so against the ordinary\u00a0 experience and conduct of man as to be rejected at a glance.\u00a0\u00a0 It seems to us to be but a fair\u00a0 inference when we say that Pedro Yulo did not act in that way unless there was\u00a0 something abnormal and unusual\u00a0 lying behind the transaction.\u00a0\u00a0 The question is, \"What was it?\"\u00a0\u00a0 The evidence does not disclose it directly.\u00a0 We can only\u00a0 draw inference and\u00a0 conclusion from the facts and circumstances as they appear.\u00a0\u00a0 The only conclusion at all logical or reasonable is that Pedro Yulo was aware, or, if not aware, at least afraid, that there was a defect in his title to the house in question and, as a result, knew that in transferring\u00a0 the property to Villadelgado he was transferring something of\u00a0 very\u00a0 doubtful value.\u00a0\u00a0 The further conclusion is that Villadelgado was equally aware of that fact and accepted the house with that understanding. This appears to be the natural, almost unavoidable inference, particularly in view of the fact that when Villadelgado purchased the house Esteban Vazquez y Decena had been in possession almost a year under claim of ownership, without paying\u00a0 rent, and\u00a0 was\u00a0 at the time of such\u00a0 sale\u00a0 in open, visible, notorious and peaceable possession of the premises, under claim of ownership, paying rent to\u00a0 nobody and admitting a superior title\u00a0 in no one.\u00a0 Furthermore, although Joaquin Villadelgado purchased the house from Pedro Yulo on the 12th of February, 1906, he made no mention of that fact to\u00a0 Esteban Vasquez y\u00a0 Decena.\u00a0 He avoided\u00a0 bringing his claims to the notice\u00a0 of Esteban.\u00a0 In other words, Villadelgado permitted one\u00a0 to occupy\u00a0 a valuable house which he claimed to own for a year and two months, from February 12, 1906, to April 24, 1907, without a word as to such occupancy, without investigating the interest which the occupant claimed in the premises,\u00a0 and without seeking to obtain possession of the same by any process.\u00a0\u00a0 When he did move he brought an action in court without\u00a0 so much as making a demand.\u00a0 Not only did Yulo and Villadelgado neglect to require rent\u00a0 of Esteban Vasquez y Decena but they also neglected to pay the rent for the ground upon which the said house stands, leaving it to be paid by Esteban Vazquez\u00a0 y Decena.<\/p><p>Such acts and conduct are unnatural and unusual.\u00a0 We believe that they outweigh very materially and with strong preponderance the\u00a0 seeming\u00a0 corroboration which Exhibits A and\u00a0 B give to the contention of Pedro Yulo.\u00a0 If the acts and conduct of persons are of value\u00a0 in the construction of their contracts, we have Esteban Vazquez y\u00a0 Decena and Antipas\u00a0 Vazquez, at a time when it could not have been premeditated for effect, acting as if they thoroughly believed\u00a0 that Exhibit B was a receipt for a payment made in discharge of the obligation incurred\u00a0 by\u00a0 the so-called <em>pacto de retro.<\/em>\u00a0 We have Pedro Yulo and Joaquin\u00a0 Villadelgado acting and conducting themselves as if they believed it also.\u00a0 Having in mind the contradictions which appear in the\u00a0 testimony\u00a0 of the witnesses for the parties to this action, we are of the opinion that such acts and conduct are decisive.<\/p><p>These considerations compel us to believe that the finding of the\u00a0 learned trial court in favor of the defendant on the subject of the payment of the obligation imposed by the so-called\u00a0 is not sustained by a fair preponderance of the evidence. <em>pacto de retro.<\/em><\/p><p>We attach no importance to the contention of defendant's counsel that the sale from Esteban\u00a0 Vazquez y Decena to Pedro Vazquez was\u00a0 fraudulent.\u00a0 No competent proof\u00a0 whatever was presented to sustain that\u00a0 contention.\u00a0 The only evidence\u00a0 offered to that end in the case refers to unauthorized acts\u00a0 of Esteban\u00a0 Vazquez, Jr., and not to those of Esteban Vazquez y Decena.<\/p><p>The\u00a0 judgment of the court below\u00a0 is reversed and\u00a0 judgment hereby given\u00a0 in\u00a0 favor of the\u00a0 plaintiff, awarding to him the\u00a0 title to and possession of the\u00a0 house in\u00a0 question.

Co., and on the west by the General McArthur Highway.<br\/><br\/>The applicant declared that he had lived on the said land since 1894 and prior thereto; that in\u00a0 1900 the municipality of Moncada deemed itself the proprietor of this land, and he was\u00a0 paying it 95 centavos a month as rent; that when the Land Tax Law went into effect, a caretaker of one named Pleming presented a sworn declaration\u00a0 for the\u00a0 purposes of the land\u00a0 tax; that the said Pleming failed to pay such tax and\u00a0 the\u00a0 provincial treasurer\u00a0 of\u00a0 Tarlac\u00a0 sold\u00a0 the land at public auction; that the applicant bought the land so sold at public auction, and that one year afterwards, no redemption thereof having been effected, the said treasurer issued to him the proper certificate\u00a0 of title, which he presented with his application, for its inscription, to the Court of Land Registration.<br\/><br\/>The preceding facts are those that he declared and proved, and he offered to present three witnesses for further proof, but did not, because the court considered it unnecessary to do so, as no opposition had been made; in fact none was made either by the municipality of Moncada, the Insular Government, or by any person whatever, either after the notices had been\u00a0 duly published or after\u00a0 the general default prescribed by law had become effective on the expiration of the term allowed for filing adverse claims.<br\/><br\/>It was proven that, since fourteen years prior to the date of his application, March 17, 1903, the applicant had been holding the land with a manifest appearance of possession, his dwelling house being erected thereon; that\u00a0 he\u00a0 was disposed to believe that the municipality had a right to collect a rental from him; but the municipality did not fortify and make good this belief, nor did it claim any right whatever in the land possessed by the applicant; that the latter saw that another\u00a0 party declared the land as\u00a0 his own for the purposes of the land tax, but such other party did not appear as an adverse claimant against his application.<br\/><br\/>Administrative action was afterwards taken to enforce the payment of the said tax, and, as the delinquent taxpayer was found not to have any personal property that could be attached, the\u00a0 assessed land was put up for sale at public auction.\u00a0 The applicant, like any other individual, and omitting consideration\u00a0 of\u00a0 any right that he might have had, attended the auction and bid in the land without opposition of any kind.\u00a0\u00a0 The year for the legal redemption elapsed and no one exercised this right.\u00a0 In compliance with the law the provincial treasurer, who had sold the land, issued the property title in consequence of the sale.<br\/><br\/>A sale is a contract transferring dominion and other real rights in the thing sold.\u00a0 An administrative authority, the same as a judicial, who sells a property belonging to a judgment debtor, because of the letter's delinquency or noncompliance with his obligation to pay, subrogates himself in place of the judgment debtor and\u00a0 perfectly authorizes the sale in the quality of owner, the same as if such debtor had voluntarily done\u00a0 so outside of a case of execution of judgment\u00a0\u00a0 The sale so effected is valid and efficacious\u00a0 as authorized and prescribed\u00a0 by law.<br\/><br\/>If the sale is impugned by one who has a right so to do, as the debtor who appeared as the proprietor of the thing sold or another who presents himself as the true and legitimate owner thereof, it may cease to be valid and efficacious.<br\/><br\/>In the case at bar, neither when\u00a0 the provincial treasurer announced the public auction, nor\u00a0 after the same was effected, nor\u00a0 subsequent to the lapse of the legal term for the redemption, nor, finally, during the trial that was originated by the application for the inscription in the registry of property, did\u00a0 the said Pleming, or the municipality\u00a0 of Murcia, or\u00a0 the Insular Government, or anyone else\u00a0 who might have an interest in the land,\u00a0 put in an appearance to impugn the sale; and, in view of the effects.of the general default, the applicant is the sole, true, and legitimate owner of the land whose registration is sought.<br\/><br\/>The conclusions reached in the decision of\u00a0 this court in the case of Valencia <i>vs.<\/i> Jimenez and Fuster (11 Phil. Rep., 492)\u00a0 are not applicable to the present case.\u00a0\u00a0 In the case just cited, the proprietress of the land sold did appear and impugn the validity\u00a0 of the sale, made administratively by the collector and assessor of the city of Manila for the collection of taxes, and, for the purposes of her opposition, alleged irregularities in the proceedings had, which prejudiced the material rights of the\u00a0 taxpayer, within the meaning of sections 84 and 86 of the\u00a0 Municipal Code.\u00a0 In the present case this did not occur.\u00a0 Had it occurred, there would now be said what was said\u00a0 then:\u00a0 that the title of ownership issued by the provincial treasurer of Tarlac does\u00a0 not necessarily imply the presumption that there was no irregularity whatever; that the presentation of the said title is not sufficient to destroy the allegation of irregularities of proceedings made against the sale effected; that the\u00a0 purchaser\u00a0 at public auction can not rest\u00a0 on the idea of having realized the purchase in such solemn manner, starting with the supposition that all\u00a0 due process\u00a0 of law necessary to\u00a0 deprive a person\u00a0 of his right of property had been observed; but he must be careful to take all due precautions to insure his lawful acquisition (<i>caveat emptor<\/i>);\u00a0 that it rests upon the purchaser\u00a0 at\u00a0 such sale to prove the regularity of all the proceedings had therein and to show that proper\u00a0 legal procedure was observed.\u00a0 But without either petition or answer on a question of this nature, no\u00a0 means are available to require the proof which would\u00a0 be necessary, the absence of which would be felt\u00a0 in the event of opposition, and\u00a0 there is no issue.\u00a0 A property title\u00a0 derived from sale and purchase, either private or public, issued or awarded in due form, is a perfect, registerable <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">prima facie <\/span>title; but if it is impugned, for want of essential requisites or for irregularities in\u00a0 the required procedure, which would constitute a radical or essential vice, then it must be proved that those requisites have been complied with or that those found wanting are not essential, that irregularities were not committed or that those objected to are not such as to vitiate the proper procedure.<br\/><br\/>The property title presented by the applicant\u00a0 is that prescribed by\u00a0 law to\u00a0 support the\u00a0 positive acquisition of\u00a0 land sold at public\u00a0 auction; it is in\u00a0 printed form according to the models\u00a0 authorized by competent authority, and contains relation of the\u00a0 proceedings carried into effect for its proper issuance.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment appealed from is reversed, and the trial court shall decree the adjudication and registration solicited.\u00a0 No special finding\u00a0 is made\u00a0 as to costs.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i> Mapa, Moreland,<\/i> and <i>Trent, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><br\/><i> Carson, J.<\/i>, dissents.<br\/><\/div>",

Mariano Cui presiding,\u00a0 for the crime of rapto, to .seventeen years, four months,\u00a0 and one day of <i>reclusion temporal,<\/i> to the corresponding accessory penalties,\u00a0 to jointly and severally indemnify the offended party in the sum of P500, and to pay an equal\u00a0 proportion of the costs of the cause.<br\/><br\/>On the afternoon of June\u00a0 19,\u00a0 1910, a large banca, or sailboat, the property of one Pedro Elmido, and manned by various persons,\u00a0 among: whom\u00a0 were the\u00a0 defendants Rufino Marasigan and Pedro Banila, anchored near the beach within the jurisdiction of the town of Sariaya, Province of Tayabas. After having discharged\u00a0 its cargo, and taken aboard\u00a0 the cargo for the return\u00a0 trip, its owner, Pedro Elmido, thinking it time to sail, asked Rufino Marasigan, who was the piloto of the boat, if he were\u00a0 not going to give the order to sail. Rufino replied that it would be better to wait until night for\u00a0 the wind to change from the land.\u00a0 He Also stated that he and his companions\u00a0 were waiting for\u00a0 a married couple who were going to take passage that night.\u00a0 He then\u00a0 disembarked and went\u00a0 in the direction of the town.\u00a0 Shortly thereafter he returned, bringing with him a trunk, <i>petate,<\/i> and a<i> bolo <\/i>and placed them aboard.<br\/><br\/>On that same night, Sunday the 19th of June, 1910, four men went to the<i> casita <\/i>which was inhabited by the offended party, Crisanta Tisico, a young single girl about twelve years of age, her brother Fortunato, and her grandmother, Juana Onlayao, who was about\u00a0 sixty years\u00a0 of\u00a0 age.\u00a0 This small house was situated in the barrio of Castaiias, town of Sariaya.\u00a0 These men having awakened the old lady, Juana, she ordered\u00a0 her grandson, Fortunato, to go\u00a0 out and learn what the people who were calling desired.\u00a0 On going outside of the house, Fortunato recognized the defendants Benito Manibo (who was sentenced and did not appeal), Fausto Baltonado, and Pedro Banila, and asked them\u00a0 what they desired.\u00a0\u00a0 They replied by asking Fortunato who were in the house.\u00a0 After having been informed that there wasn't anybody in the house except himself, his small\u00a0 sister,\u00a0 and his grandmother, they caught hold of his arms,\u00a0 struck\u00a0 and kicked him, and then carried him about ten meters from the house and tied him up to a tree, threatening him\u00a0 with death if he screamed.\u00a0 While the young boy was being tied Benito Manibo and Fausto Baltonado entered the house\u00a0 and began striking the old lady Juana with the flat side of their bolos. Pedro\u00a0 then caught Crisanta by her knees while\u00a0 she was sleeping1 and started to raise her up.\u00a0 Crisanta awoke and resisted Pedro, striking\u00a0 him with her\u00a0 hand.\u00a0 Pedro then started to drag her from the house\u00a0 and she caught hold of her grandmother and when she did\u00a0 this Fausto struck her across the\u00a0 wrist with the flat side\u00a0 of his bolo.\u00a0 Then Pedro dragged her out and\u00a0 turned her over\u00a0 to Benito Manibo.\u00a0\u00a0 Benito then carried her along, being followed by Pedro, and after having gone some few yards from the house they forced her to go along by pulling her by the hands. The little girl attempted to scream but was prevented from doing so by Benito placing his hand over her mouth.\u00a0 Benito and Pedro took the girl to the beach and placed her aboard the sailboat.\u00a0 Within a very few minutes Rufino and Fausto arrived and went\u00a0 aboard.\u00a0\u00a0 The boat was then put under way for Lobo, Batangas.\u00a0 Immediately after these four men left the house, which\u00a0 was about\u00a0 twelve\u00a0 o'clock at night, Juana\u00a0 Onlayao went to the house of the\u00a0 lieutenant of the barrio and reported this occurrence and exhibited the bruises or contusions which had been\u00a0 inflicted upon her\u00a0 at\u00a0 that time.\u00a0\u00a0 She insisted on following these parties with the hope of obtaining the release of her grandchild, but\u00a0 on account of her age and the condition of her eyes she was unable to make the trip that night.<br\/><br\/>When the boat was out at sea on that Sunday night, the defendant Pedro began threatening the little girl, Crisanta, saying\u00a0 that if she\u00a0 did\u00a0 not agree to marry Benito Manibo, or live with him as his concubine, she would be thrown\u00a0 into the sea.\u00a0 When the banca arrived at a place called Laiya, it was\u00a0 anchored to permit\u00a0 Fausto Baltonado and his wife to disembark.\u00a0 After this was done the trip was continued to\u00a0 Lobo.\u00a0 After leaving Laiya\u00a0 and before reaching Lobo the little girl discovered that the defendants had taken her tampipi which\u00a0 contained her clothes and a part\u00a0 of\u00a0 her brother's clothes, and also the\u00a0 sum of P10 in cash.\u00a0 This <i>tampipi<\/i> was later recovered, together with\u00a0 the clothing, but the P10 were never\u00a0 returned.\u00a0 Before reaching Lobo the owner of the boat, Pedro\u00a0 Elmido, became suspicious that the little girl was being abducted,\u00a0 he\u00a0 having\u00a0 heard\u00a0 the defendants threatening her, and immediately on arrival in Lobo he reported the matter to the lieutenant of the barrio, and the lieutenant reported to the municipal\u00a0 president,\u00a0 and an investigation was started which resulted in the arrest of these defendants.\u00a0 The little girl was finally returned to her home after\u00a0 seventeen days.<br\/><br\/>The facts above stated constitute the crime of abduction, as defined and punished by article 445 of\u00a0 the Penal\u00a0 Code, which article reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"The\u00a0 abduction of a woman,\u00a0 executed against her will and with unchaste\u00a0 designs, shall\u00a0 be punished\u00a0 with\u00a0 the penalty\u00a0 of <i>reclusion temporal<\/i>.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>To constitute the crime of\u00a0 abduction it is necessary to establish\u00a0 two essential\u00a0 elements: First, the act must be committed by force or\u00a0 violence; and, second,\u00a0 it must be done with unchaste designs\u00a0 (<i>miras deshonestas<\/i>).\u00a0 As to the\u00a0 first,\u00a0 the above facts\u00a0 show clearly\u00a0 that the little\u00a0 girl was taken from her home by means of\u00a0 force and violence. The defendants did not only strike the offended party with the flat side of their bolos, but also struck the old lady Juana and the young man Fortunato.\u00a0 The latter they tied to a coconut tree nearby for the purpose, no doubt, of preventing him from interfering in\u00a0 any manner With the abduction of his sister.\u00a0 The fact that Benito Manibo and his companions were trying to force the little girl to marry Benito, or live with him\u00a0 as his concubine, shows clearly that the intention of the defendants in abducting the girl was to force her to have illicit intercourse with Benito.\u00a0\u00a0 Benito was a married man and well knew that he could not marry this little girl.<br\/><br\/>The defense attempted to establish, by the testimony of the defendants Benito and Rufino, that.the taking of the young girl was done by Benito alone arid with not only her consent but also that of her brother and grandmother.\u00a0 This defense has entirely failed.\u00a0 The testimony of the witnesses for the defense\u00a0 has not overcome the direct and positive testimony\u00a0 of the offended girl, which is corroborated\u00a0 by her brother and grandmother, and also by the owner of the boat.\u00a0 The latter testified that the four defendants returned to the boat\u00a0 about\u00a0 twelve o'clock on that\u00a0 Sunday night, bringing with them this little girl.\u00a0\u00a0 The little girl specifically\u00a0 and definitely\u00a0 identified all of these defendants as having taken a direct part in forcibly taking her from tier home.<br\/><br\/>In the commission of\u00a0 this crime there were present the generic aggravating circumstances of nocturnity and\u00a0 the commission of the acts in the house of the\u00a0 offended party, inasmuch\u00a0 as\u00a0 it has been shown\u00a0 that the defendants\u00a0 took advantage of the darkness of the night and the late hour to commit this brutal act.\u00a0 No extenuating circumstances were present.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from being strictly in accordance with the law and the merits of the case, the same is hereby affirmed: <i>Provided, however,<\/i>\u00a0 That the appellants be also condemned to return to the offended family the PIO appropriated by them.\u00a0 Costs will be taxes against the appellants.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i> Arellano, C, J,, Mapa, Carson<\/i>, and <i>Moreland, JJ.,<\/i> concur.<br\/><\/div>",

and the judge or justice\u00a0 of the\u00a0 peace shall, after hearing, on due notice to\u00a0 both\u00a0 parties,\u00a0 discharge the\u00a0 order of\u00a0 attachment provided the defendant shall execute\u00a0 an\u00a0 obligation to the plaintiff with surety to\u00a0 be approved by the judge, or justice of the peace,\u00a0 to the effect that in case the plaintiff recover judgment in the\u00a0 action, the defendant will, on demand, redeliver the attached property so released to the officer of the\u00a0 court, to be applied to the payment of the judgment, or, in default thereof, that the defendant and surety will, on demand, pay to the plaintiff the full value of the property\u00a0 released.\u00a0 The judge or justice\u00a0 of the\u00a0 peace making such\u00a0 order may\u00a0 fix the sum for which the undertaking must\u00a0 be executed, and for that purpose may take such\u00a0 steps\u00a0 as he\u00a0 finds necessary\u00a0 to determine the value of the property attached, which obligation shall be filed with the other papers in the cause, and upon its approval by\u00a0 the judge or justice of the\u00a0 peace and the making of the order\u00a0 by\u00a0 him for the discharge\u00a0 of\u00a0 the attachment, all of the property so\u00a0 released, and\u00a0 all\u00a0 of\u00a0 the proceeds of the sale thereof, shall\u00a0 be\u00a0 delivered to the\u00a0 defendant, the obligation aforesaid standing in\u00a0 place\u00a0 of\u00a0 the property so released.\"<\/blockquote>It is evident from the section just quoted that the only condition which, under the law, needs\u00a0 to be\u00a0 placed in a bond given\u00a0 on the dissolution of an attachment is \"that in\u00a0 case the plaintiff recover\u00a0 judgment in the action, the defendant will, on\u00a0 demand, redeliver the attached property so released\u00a0 to\u00a0 the officer of the\u00a0 court,\u00a0 to\u00a0 be applied to\u00a0 the payment\u00a0 of\u00a0 the judgment, or, in\u00a0 default thereof, that the defendant and surety will, on demand,\u00a0 pay to the plaintiff the full value of the property released.\"<br\/><br\/>The bond given by the defendants in this case, and upon which this action is brought, contained the condition above mentioned and also the following condition:<br\/><blockquote>\"Furthermore, the said defendant and his said sureties, on\u00a0 demand, will\u00a0 pay the sum demanded in the\u00a0 complaint, with all\u00a0 the costs and damages which the\u00a0 court\u00a0 shall find in his judgment\u00a0 against the defendant:<i> Provided, always,<\/i> That\u00a0 said amount shall not exceed the sum of P5,000.\"<\/blockquote>Apparently the plaintiff relied upon the clause just quoted and not\u00a0 upon the first condition in the bond.\u00a0\u00a0 He\u00a0 rested his case without proving the value of the property attached and subsequently returned to the defendant\u00a0 upon the dissolution of the attachment.\u00a0\u00a0 The trial court called the attention of plaintiff's counsel\u00a0 to\u00a0 the fact that he had\u00a0 failed to prove the value of such property and suggested the necessity of making such proof.\u00a0 In\u00a0 reply to this\u00a0 suggestion, counsel said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The sureties say in their undertaking 'we will pay the sum demanded in the complaint, with all\u00a0 the\u00a0 costs and damages which the court shall find in his judgment against the defendant: <i>Provided,\u00a0 always,<\/i>.That said\u00a0 amount shall not exceed the .sum\u00a0 of P5,000.'\u00a0 The\u00a0 undertaking, as\u00a0 I understand it,\u00a0 contains two promises\u00a0 on\u00a0 the part of\u00a0 the sureties: One, that they will pay the value\u00a0 of the property attached;\u00a0 and the other, that they will respond for the full amount of the judgment.\u00a0 The undertaking\u00a0 which is the subject of this complaint does not\u00a0 correspond exactly\u00a0 to that required\u00a0 by the Code, as section 440 says that the undertaking shall be for the value of the property attached. The undertaking given is, in addition, for the sum demanded in the complaint, with costs,\"<\/blockquote>No proof was offered as to the value of the goods attached and subsequently returned to the debtor upon the dissolution of the attachment.\u00a0\u00a0 The question before us is whether or not the plaintiff may recover upon that provision\u00a0 of the undertaking wherein the signers of said bond obligated themselves, in addition to redelivering the property attached to the sheriff or pay its value, to pay the sum demanded in the complaint,\u00a0 together\u00a0 with costs,\u00a0 and damages,\u00a0 providing the\u00a0 same should not exceed P5,000.<br\/><br\/>We are of the opinion that the plaintiff\u00a0 can not recover. The bond is a statutory bond.\u00a0 It is made by\u00a0 virtue and because of the law.\u00a0 The consideration for the undertaking given is the release of the property attached by the plaintiff. The law requires\u00a0 that\u00a0 such attachment shall be released when\u00a0 the defendant has given an undertaking to deliver the property or to respond for its value.\u00a0\u00a0 When such an undertaking is given the defendant is entitled, as a matter of law, to\u00a0 the redelivery of the property attached.\u00a0 When he has given such an undertaking, he has done all that the law requires.\u00a0\u00a0 He is entitled to his property without the necessity of incurring further obligation.<br\/><br\/>On\u00a0 the other hand, all that the plaintiff is entitled to, under the\u00a0 law, is to\u00a0 be assured by a proper undertaking that, if he redelivers the property to\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant,\u00a0 such property will,\u00a0 in\u00a0 case he succeeds, be redelivered to the officer of the court or its value paid to him.\u00a0\u00a0 When he has received this assurance in due form of law, he has received all to which he is entitled.\u00a0 The law permits him to require no more.\u00a0\u00a0 On the delivery of an\u00a0 undertaking assuring\u00a0 to him one\u00a0 or the other of these things,\u00a0 he\u00a0 is\u00a0 obligated, by law, to redeliver the\u00a0 property without demanding further liability on the part of the defendant.\u00a0 This being so, what consideration\u00a0 was there for\u00a0 the\u00a0 additional\u00a0 provision incorporated in the undertaking referred\u00a0 to,\u00a0 wherein\u00a0 and whereby the judgment\u00a0 debtor and the sureties agreed\u00a0 to pay any Judgment that might.be secured against him under the pleadings ?\u00a0 We are satisfied that there was none.\u00a0 Such promise on the part\u00a0 of the\u00a0 sureties and of the judgment debtor was wholly without\u00a0 consideration.\u00a0 It was something over and above that which the law required for the protection of the plaintiff's rights.\u00a0\u00a0 By such provision the judgment debtor and the sureties promised to do something that they were not under any legal\u00a0 or moral obligation to do.\u00a0\u00a0 For the doing of it they received no consideration whatsoever.<br\/><blockquote>\"Recovery upon a bond may be prevented by a want of consideration.\"\u00a0 (Mt.

Rep., 620), this court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"Where the form of the bond for the purpose of admitting a defendant in a criminal case to liberty during the pendency of the action\u00a0 is prescribed by law, such form must be followed\u00a0 in substance.\u00a0 The authorities can not impose a greater obligation than that\u00a0 prescribed\u00a0 by such form. The\u00a0 authorities can not\u00a0 vary its terms, so as to impose upon the defendant and his bondsmen greater obligations.\" (Citing U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Sauer, 73 Fed. Rep.,\u00a0 671.)<\/blockquote>The\u00a0 fact\u00a0 that the conditions\u00a0 of the undertaking given were more onerous\u00a0 than those\u00a0 required by the law does not make the bond\u00a0 void.\u00a0 It is\u00a0 still a valid undertaking and may\u00a0 be enforced\u00a0 to the extent of the statutory\u00a0 requirements.<br\/><blockquote>\"A bond which contains all\u00a0 the conditions required by statute, and\u00a0 also\u00a0 conditions in excess of\u00a0 those specified by statute, is valid, so far as it imposes obligations authorized by the statute, and the stipulations which are in\u00a0 excess of it may be rejected as surplusage.\"\u00a0 (U.

He honestly believed that the defendants had made themselves liable for the\u00a0 whole amount of the claim.\u00a0 The trial court took\u00a0 this view.\u00a0 He found at first that\u00a0 the question was not free from doubt.\u00a0\u00a0 Under these\u00a0 circumstances we believe\u00a0 that, in the interest of justice, the plaintiff\u00a0 should be given an opportunity to prove the value of said property.<br\/><br\/>The judgment\u00a0 is, therefore,\u00a0 reversed and\u00a0 a new trial granted for this purpose only.\u00a0\u00a0 Without any special ruling as to costs.\u00a0 So\u00a0 ordered.<br\/><br\/><i> Mapa, Carson<\/i>, and <i>Moreland, JJ.,<\/i> concur.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

The\u00a0 captain of the\u00a0 ship from which the potatoes were being\u00a0 discharged,\u00a0 the first\u00a0 officer\u00a0 of\u00a0 the same, and the customs inspector who was stationed on board thereof during the discharge of its\u00a0 cargo, and\u00a0 other witnesses, demonstrate\u00a0 this\u00a0 fact\u00a0 beyond\u00a0 a\u00a0 reasonable doubt.\u00a0\u00a0 That the potatoes,\u00a0 when\u00a0 discharged from the vessel into the <i>lorcha,<\/i> were in good condition,\u00a0 is demonstrated with equal\u00a0 conclusiveness.\u00a0 This is shown not only by the testimony of the witnesses above mentioned, but by all the circumstances of the case.\u00a0 In addition to the potatoes discharged into the <i> lorcha<\/i>, there had\u00a0 been discharged into numerous <i>cascos<\/i> several thousand\u00a0 crates of\u00a0 potatoes\u00a0 from the same ship and from\u00a0 the same hold at the\u00a0 same time.\u00a0 It has\u00a0 been shown\u00a0 by uncontradicted\u00a0 proof that all of\u00a0 the potatoes, except\u00a0 those\u00a0 found in the <i>lorcha<\/i>, were\u00a0 in good condition at\u00a0 the time of their discharge.\u00a0 Only those in\u00a0 the <i> lorcha,<\/i> after two days of exposure to the heat of the sun, in tightly closed compartments, without ventilation, were found to be rotted beyond use or value.\u00a0\u00a0 From\u00a0 the evidence\u00a0 we\u00a0 are satisfied that the\u00a0 potatoes\u00a0 in\u00a0 question\u00a0 when\u00a0 discharged from the ship into the\u00a0 lorcha were in good condition.\u00a0 That such was the case is demonstrated from the evidence beyond cavil\u00a0 or question.\u00a0 The only witness who seriously questions that fact is the witness Villanueva, who was an employee of the plaintiff on board the vessel at the time the potatoes were discharged into\u00a0 the <i>lorcha<\/i>, and was shortly afterwards discharged by\u00a0 the plaintiff.\u00a0 He\u00a0 testified\u00a0 that when so discharged they\u00a0 were so badly rotted as to be without value.\u00a0 Yet we find that\u00a0 this same witness, when he made a written report to the plaintiff, his employer, as to the condition of the potatoes when discharged,\u00a0 therein stated concerning\u00a0 the\u00a0 condition of those potatoes that\u00a0 out of the 1,085\u00a0 crates\u00a0 so discharged into the <i>lorcha<\/i> only 54 crates were in bad condition and\u00a0 a few were damp.\u00a0\u00a0 The condition\u00a0 of\u00a0 the potatoes\u00a0 thus described by the written report which he at the\u00a0 time made to his employer describes a condition usual with potatoes at that time of the year and about the same as that of the potatoes discharged into the <i> cascos.<\/i><br\/><br\/>It has been shown by the evidence that the worthless and rotted potatoes of this cargo constituted\u00a0 about 5 per cent of the whole.\u00a0\u00a0 This seems from the evidence to be the usual loss sustained\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 transportation\u00a0 of\u00a0 potatoes at that season of the\u00a0 year.\u00a0 Gross negligence of the defendant in the handling\u00a0 and care\u00a0 of these potatoes being conclusively\u00a0\u00a0 demonstrated by the proofs, he should pay to the plaintiff the value of those lost\u00a0 by such negligence.\u00a0 The value of the potatoes\u00a0 proved\u00a0 upon\u00a0 the trial\u00a0 was P3.75 a\u00a0 crate, amounting in all\u00a0 to P4,068.75.\u00a0 Deducting 5 per cent of this sum\u00a0 for the general loss on\u00a0 the whole\u00a0 cargo, there remains a balance of P3,865.31.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 judgment\u00a0 is\u00a0 reversed and a\u00a0 judgment\u00a0 is\u00a0 hereby given\u00a0 against the defendant and\u00a0 in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of P3,865.31, with\u00a0 costs of this appeal.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i> Arellano,\u00a0 C.

This interest, according to the agreement in the records, amounts to P829.38,\u00a0 which, deducted from P3,656.66, leaves P2,827.28, or the principal which the\u00a0 defendant\u00a0 admits that he\u00a0 owes.\u00a0 But as\u00a0 the plaintiffs agreed with the defendant that they would deduct P500 on\u00a0 account\u00a0 of\u00a0 losses\u00a0 by\u00a0 fire which the latter had suffered, the P2,827.28 must be reduced to P2,327.28.\u00a0 Furthermore, as\u00a0 it was stipulated\u00a0 that the defendant was\u00a0 to collect three per cent on\u00a0 the actual principal due, that is, P2,827.28, which\u00a0 three per cent\u00a0 amounts to P84.81, this sum deducted from P2,327.28 leaves P2,242.47,\u00a0 and this is the amount which the defendant is willing to pay.<br\/><br\/>The Court of\u00a0 First Instance of the city of Manila, which tried this case, sentenced the defendant to pay to the plaintiffs P2,742.47, with legal interest thereon at the rate of 6 per cent per annum from March 30, 1909, the date of the filing of the complaint, until complete payment, and the costs.<br\/><br\/>The defendant appealed, and his bill of exceptions having been forwarded\u00a0 with right to a review of the evidence, he made the two following assignments of error:<br\/><ol type=\"1\"><li>The trial court erred in holding that the deduction of P500, made by the plaintiffs, was conditional on the defendant's paying interest on the remainder or balance ascertained to be due on January 1, 1907; and<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>By not holding that Exhibit A was conclusive and decisive proof that such deduction was not conditional, but pure and simple.<\/li><\/ol>Exhibit A is\u00a0 a\u00a0 letter addressed\u00a0 by the plaintiffs to the defendant on May 8, 1908,\u00a0 in which there is\u00a0 a\u00a0 paragraph which\u00a0 reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"We received a copy of the letter which you addressed to Mr. Krafft under date of January\u00a0 2, and with reference to your statement\u00a0 that\u00a0 we do\u00a0 not wish to acknowledge the sum of P5OO, the liability for which Mr. Krafft assumed, in the\u00a0 matter of the \"Alhambra,\" we\u00a0 have to say that we are now willing\u00a0 to acknowledge it.\u00a0 On the other hand, we must collect interest on the balance of your account\u00a0 from January 1, 1907, according to the verbal agreement and the letters exchanged between you and this factory.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>At the foot of this letter appears the defendant's answer, as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"I have received your communication and in reply thereto must state that I am surprised at the language of your letter, because you speak of interest, a thing which did not enter into any of our contracts.\u00a0 My credit in your firm, which Mr.\u00a0 Krafft granted me,\u00a0 as proved by a notarial document, was an unconditional credit\u00a0 for the\u00a0 cigarettes which I\u00a0 took\u00a0 and am selling\u00a0 in this market,\u00a0 and was\u00a0 not for money bearing interest, for you yourself know that I sold to the\u00a0 storekeepers on the same conditions, and I do not understand\u00a0 why\u00a0 an agent should pay interest\u00a0 on\u00a0 the amount of the goods\u00a0 taken by him.\u00a0\u00a0 I, therefore, refer the matter to you in order that\u00a0 you may\u00a0 consider the same justly and in an impartial manner.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The conclusion of the judgment,\u00a0 as regards the interest, is that the defendant\u00a0 ought not to pay, it, and that the sum of P829,38 should be\u00a0 deducted from P3,656.66, the amount demanded.\u00a0 The\u00a0 plaintiffs\u00a0 assented\u00a0 to\u00a0 this\u00a0 part\u00a0 of\u00a0 the judgment.<br\/><br\/>The conclusion relative\u00a0 to the three per cent commission, is that it should\u00a0 be\u00a0 paid to\u00a0 the defendant and\u00a0 that\u00a0 the amount thereof, F84.81, should\u00a0 be\u00a0 deducted from the sum sued for.\u00a0 The plaintiffs\u00a0 also assented to this part of\u00a0 the judgment.\u00a0 Consequently, the\u00a0 latter agreed with the finding that the\u00a0 defendant should pay them P2,742.47. But the defendant was not willing to accept this amount, because,\u00a0 upon the support of\u00a0 the plaintiffs' Exhibit A, he claimed that a reduction should be made therefrom of\u00a0 the P500\u00a0 allowed\u00a0 by\u00a0 Mr.\u00a0 Krafft, a deduction finally recognized and accepted by the plaintiffs.<br\/><br\/>The deduction\u00a0 of the P500, recognized and\u00a0 accepted by the plaintiffs\u00a0 in their letter, Exhibit A, can not be interpreted either in letter or in spirit as being conditional, that is, that the\u00a0 plaintiffs\u00a0 accepted the specific deduction made by Mr. Krafft, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">on condition<\/span>\u00a0 of collecting interest on\u00a0 the balance\u00a0 owing.\u00a0\u00a0 What they\u00a0 said,\u00a0 after a complete\u00a0 and finished grammatical\u00a0 sentence, was that\u00a0 <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">on the other hand<\/span> they would collect interest according to verbal contract and letters exchanged, a\u00a0 claim rejected by the\u00a0 defendant,\u00a0 for there\u00a0 was no verbal\u00a0 agreement\u00a0 nor any letter\u00a0 whatever relative to this particular,\u00a0 nor\u00a0 was any proof of such agreement\u00a0 or\u00a0 letters adduced at\u00a0 the trial.<br\/><br\/>It is logical that the P500 allowed, also be deducted and should not appear as a part of the balance due.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, with the understanding that the amount which the\u00a0 defendant must pay to the plaintiffs is P2,242.47,\u00a0 the judgment appealed from is in all other respects affirmed. So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Moreland<\/i>, and <i>Trent, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><\/div>",

Madariaga, Miguel Domingo, and Jose\" Jose,\u00a0 filed in the Court of First Instance, Province of Ilocos Norte, a civil suit against Manuel Castro for the purpose of determining their title to and recovering the\u00a0 possession of six parcels of land, and for the further purpose of having the registered\u00a0 title in the name\u00a0 of\u00a0 the defendant canceled.\u00a0 These six\u00a0 parcels of land are fully described with their metes and bounds in the first paragraph of the complaint.\u00a0 After describing the lands and\u00a0 giving their location, the\u00a0 plaintiffs allege\u00a0 that they,\u00a0 together with other persons whose names are not given, entered into an agreement with one Fructuoso\u00a0 Castro, father of the defendant, to have\u00a0 the\u00a0 title to\u00a0 the lands in question together with other real property in that vicinity, adjusted; that in pursuance of this agreement, Fructuoso Castro,\u00a0 in 1890, filed an application with the\u00a0 authorities asking for a Government grant; that Fructuoso Castro, instead of\u00a0 carrying out the agreement\u00a0 to have the patent issued in the name of himself and the plaintiffs as co-owners, proceeded to have said patent issued in his own name only; that after\u00a0 receiving this Government grant in July, 1891, and having it\u00a0 duly registered in 1895,\u00a0 he dispossessed them of these six parcels of land; that Fructuoso Castro, having died about the year 1896, the\u00a0 defendant Manuel\u00a0 Castro, being the only heir of his deceased father, succeeded to the ownership and possession of these lands; and that since they were\u00a0 illegally dispossessed of this property\u00a0 in 1894 they have not received the products of the same up to the time of filing this complaint.\u00a0\u00a0 They ask judgment, declaring\u00a0 that they,\u00a0 together with the defendant, are\u00a0 the owners of the said lands; that the registration in the name of Fructupso Castro be canceled; for the sum of P1,340, the value of the products since 1896; and for the cost of the cause.<p>The defendant,\u00a0 in his\u00a0 answer, admitted and set\u00a0 up the Government grant and the registration\u00a0 of the same in the name of his father, and also the transmission of this property to himself upon his father's death.\u00a0\u00a0 He further alleges in his amended answer that he, in 1896, by means of a public document, sold these lands to one Manuel Ruiz for the sum of P1,000, and that since that time he has not\u00a0 had possession npr had anything to do with said lands.<\/p><p>Subsequent\u00a0 to the filing of this amended answer,\u00a0 Manuel Ruiz was made party defendant and set up the same defense as Manuel Castro; that is to say, that the Government grant had been issued to Fructuoso Castro, and that Manuel Castro inherited this land on the death of his father and sold the same to him (Ruiz) for a valuable consideration.<\/p><p>Eusebio Tongson, Julian Javier, Ponciano Castro, Antonio\u00a0 Bustamante, and Lorenzo Bonaan, having\u00a0 intervened as third parties, alleged that they, together with other persons whose names are not given, and the defendant\u00a0 Castro are\u00a0 the\u00a0 true and\u00a0 lawful owners of the lands in dispute. They deny that the plaintiffs have any interest\u00a0 in these lands and ask the court to render judgment annulling the registered title arid declaring themselves, including Castro, together with other unnamed persons to be the absolute owners of said lands.\u00a0 Manuel Ruiz, after denying the\u00a0 allegations of these interveners, asks that these lands, which had\u00a0 heretofore been placed\u00a0 in the hands of a receiver, be turned over to him on his presenting the necessary bond, and\u00a0 that he be declared the lawful owner by reason of the purchase from the defendant Castro.<\/p><p>Subsequently thereto and on the 30th\u00a0 of January, 1905, the interveners filed an amended complaint in which they include the names of their alleged co-owners, Adelaida Guerrero and thirteen others.\u00a0 Up to this time,\u00a0 the\u00a0 only lands mentioned are the six parcels in Doro, civil case\u00a0 No. 53.<\/p><p>On the 6th of February, 1905, Adelaida Guerrero and the thirteen other plaintiffs named therein, being the same parties as those mentioned in the complaint dated January 30, filed a complaint against Manuel Castro, civil case No. 356, alleging that they are the true owners of two parcels of land situated in Doro and Taguipuro, described as follows:<\/p><p>The first, situated in Doro, containing 10 hectares 16 ares and\u00a0 20\u00a0 centares, is bounded on\u00a0 the north by the\u00a0 Bacarra River, on the south by the Hacienda de Navotas, on the east by Estanislao Ruiz, on the west by Victoriano Castro.\u00a0 The second, in Taguipuro, containing 9 hectares 75 ares and\u00a0 89 centares, is bounded on\u00a0 the north and south by\u00a0 Laoag,\u00a0 on the east by the lands of the deceased Vietoriano Castro, and on the west by Estanislao Ruiz.<\/p><p>The first parcel is the same land as that involved in civil case No. 53.\u00a0\u00a0 All of the first interveners in case No. 53 are plaintiffs\u00a0 in this case.\u00a0\u00a0 The same allegations as were made in case No.\u00a0 53 with reference to\u00a0 the\u00a0 obtaining by\u00a0 Fructuoso Castro, father of the defendant Manuel Castro, of a Government\u00a0 patent, are made in this case.\u00a0\u00a0 But the plaintiffs in this\u00a0 case also\u00a0 allege that when they discovered in 1894 that the patent had been issued to Fructuoso Castro they sought to have this serious error rectified by the administrative authorities and that they were then informed that they would have to go into court\u00a0 to\u00a0 have\u00a0 this done.\u00a0\u00a0 The plaintiffs\u00a0 ask judgment, declaring the title issued to Fructuoso Castro null\u00a0 and void, and\u00a0 for the sum of P2,880 damages,\u00a0 being the value of the\u00a0 products of\u00a0 these\u00a0 lands since they were dispossessed in 1894.<\/p><p>Manuel Ruiz, having been made a party defendant, in conjunction with the other defendant, denies all the allegations in the complaint and alleges as a special defense that he is the owner of the\u00a0 lands in question\u00a0 by reason of having purchased the same from the other defendant.<\/p><p>By agreement of the parties and the approval of the court, the two cases, Nos. 53 and 356, were joined and tried together.<\/p><p>The court filed the following decision on June 4, 1906:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"In the Province of Ilocos Norte, P. I., in the time of the large municipalities, there were lands of considerable extent under the name of <em>Estancia\u00a0 de Navotas,<\/em>\u00a0 which the Government\u00a0 had established under certain conditions for the pasturage of the animals of said province and the sustenance of a\u00a0 garrison in Lepanto,\u00a0 P.\u00a0 I.<\/p><p>\"This <em>Estancia<\/em> included the lands of the <em>sitios<\/em> called Navotas, Doro. Grande, Doro Pequefio, Taguipuro, etc., of the municipality\u00a0 of Laoag of the said province, and which was abolished before the inauguration of the civil governments in these Islands in the\u00a0 year\u00a0 1886\u00a0 and said lands occupied equally by innumerable families for the cultivation\u00a0 of rice.<\/p><p>\"By agreement of the many occupants of the part of said abolished <em>Estancia<\/em> called Doro Pequeiio and\u00a0 Taguipuro, their land was divided\u00a0 into five parts,\u00a0 so\u00a0 that Victoriano Castro, Montano Guerrero, Estanislao Ruiz, Eduardo Fontanilla, and Fructuoso Castro might petition the govenment for the title to each\u00a0 part, and when in the year 1891 five titles were issued in favor of and in the exclusive name of\u00a0 the respective parties above mentioned, these all\u00a0 later took possession of the\u00a0 said lands and ejected the occupants.<\/p><p>\"The land in Doro whose title was issued in tne name of Fructuoso Castro,\u00a0 measures\u00a0 10\u00a0 hectares 16\u00a0 ares and\u00a0 20 centares, and is bounded on the north by the Bacarra River, on the east by the land of Estanislao Ruiz,\u00a0 on\u00a0 the south by the lands of Navotas, and on the west\u00a0 by the land of Victoriano Castro.<\/p><p>\"The plaintiffs and\u00a0 interveners should not be considered the\u00a0 owners of\u00a0 the said land situated in Doro, because,\u00a0 although they all occupied it jointly, they did not comply with the provisions of the law; and for this reason\u00a0 they lack the proper title, which, although they tried to obtain, they were not able to secure.<\/p><p>\"If the title of Fructuoso Castro is invalid, and if none of the parties interested\u00a0 in this\u00a0 case own\u00a0 the land,\u00a0 its reversion to the State must necessarily follow, without prejudice, however, to the right of\u00a0 purchase from the\u00a0 Government in the form provided by the law.<\/p><p>\"As, during\u00a0 the period of so many years, the land had passed into the hands of the intervener ManueJ Ruiz,\u00a0 he should be entitled to the products received therefrom.<\/p><p>\"It does not\u00a0 appear that titles were issued\u00a0 for the\u00a0 land in Taguipuro in the municipality of Laoag, Ilocos Norte,\u00a0 as set\u00a0 forth in the complaint of the interveners Eusebio Tongson and others, as was the case in Doro, and none of the evidence submitted touches this point.<\/p><p>\"In view of all the foregoing, the court declares the title issued by the Government in the name of Fructuoso Castro to be null and void, and this decision shall be\u00a0 noted in the inscription of said title in the registry of deeds,\u00a0\u00a0 The court also dismisses\u00a0 the\u00a0 claims\u00a0 of the plaintiffs and\u00a0 the interveners and decrees the sale made by the defendant Manuel Castro to the intervener Manuel Reyes\u00a0 to be also null and void.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>All the parties except the\u00a0 original\u00a0 plaintiffs in case No. 53 appealed and make the following assignments of errors f<\/p><p align=\"center\"> \"PLAINTIFFS.<\/p><blockquote><p>\"1.

The court erred in not declaring the land in Doro to belong to the third party, Manuel Ruiz, transferred to him by virtue of the sale executed\u00a0 by the defendant\u00a0 Manuel Castro, son of the deceased Fructuoso Castro.\"<\/p><p>Counsel for the plaintiffs, on page 14 of his printed brief, says: \"The lands of Doro and of Taguipuro are included in the title issued in the name of Fructuoso Castro\u00a0 only, and the recovery of all of them (the lands)\u00a0 is sought in this complaint.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Counsel for\u00a0 the defendants, in his printed argument in support of his\u00a0 assignments of error, nowhere mentions the lands situated\u00a0 in Taguipuro, but only asks this court to reverse the judgment appealed from and declare the lands situated in <em>Doro <\/em>to be the exclusive property of the defendant Ruiz.\u00a0 The defendants do not now claim or pretend to have any interest in the lands in Taguipuro.\u00a0 The trial court found as a fact that it had not been shown that a Government grant had been issued for the lands in Taguipuro.<\/p><p>The certificate issued by the registrar of deeds, the. public document of purchase and sale from Castro to Ruiz, and the judicial act of fixing\u00a0 the boundaries and monuments refer only to the 10 hectares 16 ares and 20 centares situated in Doro.\u00a0\u00a0 There is nothing in the record to show that the defendants have ever had possession or claimed ownership of the lands in Taguipuro, except the mere allegations in the complaint,\u00a0 and these allegations are specifically denied in the answer.<\/p><p>After an examination of the entire record before us and taking into consideration\u00a0 the position\u00a0 of counsel for\u00a0 the defendants with reference to this parcel of land, we can not say that the court erred in making the above findings of fact.\u00a0 It was incumbent upon the plaintiffs to establish their case by competent testimony. This they entirely failed to do.\u00a0 The court so found, yet it failed to pronounce judgment.\u00a0 It was\u00a0 the plain duty of\u00a0 the court to render\u00a0 judgment\u00a0 in favor of the defendants, dismissing the complaint with reference\u00a0 to the lands in Taguipuro.\u00a0 If parties to a suit fail, after a fair and full opportunity, to present\u00a0 proof with reference\u00a0 to the subject matter in litigation, the\u00a0 court is not by\u00a0 any\u00a0 means justified in declining to pronounce judgment.<\/p><p>With\u00a0 reference\u00a0 to\u00a0 the\u00a0 lands, in Doro,\u00a0 counsel for the plaintiffs insists that they, together with the deceased Fructuoso Castro, had been for a long time prior\u00a0 to the year 1890 occupying said lands\u00a0 as coowners; that after a\u00a0 clear and positive agreement, Fructuoso Castro obligated himself to petition for and obtain a title from the State in the name of all of them and himself\u00a0 to said lands; that Castro, in violation of this agreement, obtained the title\u00a0 in his own name only; that they,\u00a0 on\u00a0 discovering this fact\u00a0 and before the title was finally registered, filed a petition with the administrative authorities, asking\u00a0 that\u00a0 the title thus issued be corrected so as to include their names as coowners; and that\u00a0 said authorities declined to grant their request and informed them that they would have to obtain\u00a0 relief from the courts.<\/p><p>The deceased, Fructuoso Castro, on the 21st day of April, 1890, addressed the following communication to the president\u00a0 of the provincial board which had charge of the adjustment of titles:<\/p><blockquote>\u00a0 <p>\"Don Fructuoso Castro, a sexagenarian, born and residing in this capital, whose personal cedula for the current\u00a0 year I have the honor to forward herewith, with all\u00a0 submission and respect presented himself to me and said: 1, together with\u00a0 my co-owners, Patricio Tamayo, Pio Foronda,\u00a0 and others, possess a field and garden in the sitios called Doro vel Caraoaoi and Taguipuro which\u00a0 came into our possession by\u00a0 inheritance, whose ownership and enjoyment we have had for more than the last forty years without interruption.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 boundaries\u00a0 and area\u00a0 agree approximately with the following\u00a0 description:\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 * ' \"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>This communication was signed by the\u00a0 deceased, Fructuoso Castro, and formed the basis for the adjustment of the title, which resulted in the issuance by\u00a0 the authorities of a grant to the lands in Doro to the petitioner.\u00a0 On receipt\u00a0 of\u00a0 this document, the\u00a0 authorities\u00a0 proceeded in\u00a0 due form as provided by law and granted the petitioner a patent which was duly registered\u00a0 in 1895.\u00a0 The petitioner Castro admitted and recognized at the time he\u00a0 started\u00a0 these proceedings\u00a0 that not only Tamayo, Foronda, and others were with himself in possession\u00a0 of these lands and had been for some forty years, but also that he\u00a0 and the said parties were co-owners.\u00a0\u00a0 The Government grant was issued to Castro in 1891.\u00a0 Pio Foronda filed a protest on the 16th of February, 1894, with\u00a0 the adjustment\u00a0 board which\u00a0 had issued this patent.\u00a0\u00a0 In this protest, Foronda set\u00a0 up the fact that he and others,\u00a0 together with Castro,\u00a0 were not only possessors but co-owners of the lands\u00a0 in Doro and asked the board to rectify or correct the title and issue the same in all of their names as such\u00a0 co-owners.\u00a0\u00a0 The board referred this petition to the provincial fiscal, who rendered the following opinion:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"The right of Foronda and his\u00a0 associates is unquestionable as appears from the first to the last page of this record, but the claim should now be made\u00a0 before the courts; and to that end, and if he so requests it, Foronda\u00a0 must be given a copy of the\u00a0 material testimony.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>While it is true that Fructuoso Castro agreed to obtain from the Spanish Government a title in the\u00a0 name of himself and his\u00a0 co-possessors to the\u00a0 land in question, this\u00a0 agreement was not in\u00a0 writing and only appears\u00a0 to have been established by the oral testimony and\u00a0 the\u00a0 statements made in Castro's petition.\u00a0 The record fails to disclose why Foronda and the other interested parties did not pursue their remedy in court in\u00a0 1894 before the Government grant was finally registered.\u00a0 It\u00a0 must be presumed, in the absence of proof to the contrary,\u00a0 that\u00a0 those\u00a0 interested parties abandoned their rights or\u00a0 entered into some kinds of\u00a0 settlement with Castro; otherwise, they would have sought to prevent the inscribing of this title in the property register.<\/p><p>It is a fact, not denied, that the defendant Manuel Ruiz purchased this land from his codefendant Manuel Castro in the year 1896,\u00a0 and that Castro at that time was in possession\u00a0 of the\u00a0 land under the grant\u00a0 from the Spanish Government, which grant\u00a0 was duly inscribed in the land register.\u00a0 These\u00a0 property\u00a0 rights\u00a0 of\u00a0 Manuel\u00a0 Ruiz,\u00a0 who purchased this land from Castro, who held\u00a0 a duly inscribed title thereto, can in no wise be affected by the terms of the unrecorded agreement between the\u00a0 vendor's\u00a0 father and third parties.

Rep.,\u00a0 204.)<\/p><p>The court declared this title or Government grant issued to Fructuoso Castro null and void on the ground that\u00a0 it had\u00a0 been issued on the false presumption that the grantee Caatro\u00a0 was in possession of\u00a0 the land at the time it was issued,\u00a0 and the court held further that neither the plaintiffs nor\u00a0 the defendant\u00a0 Manuel Castro, nor\u00a0 Manuel Ruiz. who purchased from Castro, had any title to the land, because\u00a0 none of them had complied\u00a0 with the provisions of law\u00a0 touching the issuance and perfection of titles to public lands.\u00a0 The court then declared the land\u00a0 in question to be the property of the State, annulled the title issued to Fructuoso Castro and also\u00a0 the transfer made by Manuel Castro to Manuel Ruiz,\u00a0 and directed\u00a0 a note\u00a0 to this effect to be entered upon the register of property wherein it was inscribed.\u00a0 The State is not a party to this action, nor did it pray for a cancellation of\u00a0 said title.\u00a0 Hence,\u00a0 the trial judge in declaring this title null and void and the land in question the property of the State, clearly\u00a0 exceeded\u00a0 his authority.<\/p><p>It appears that the land in question has been placed in the hands of a receiver by the trial court, pending the outcome of this action;\u00a0 but we\u00a0 are clearly of the\u00a0 opinion, in the light of all the facts as they appear from the\u00a0 undisputed allegations of the parties, the documentary\u00a0 evidence, and the findings of the trial court, that the appointment of such a receiver was wholly uncalled for, and that he should be discharged forthwith and the possession of\u00a0 the\u00a0 land\u00a0 returned to the defendant Ruiz.<\/p><p>Let judgment be entered in\u00a0 accordance with this opinion, reversing the judgment of tne trial court and directing the judge of\u00a0 that\u00a0 court\u00a0 to\u00a0 discharge\u00a0 forthwith\u00a0 the receiver heretofore appointed, with instructions to return\u00a0 the land to the\u00a0 possession\u00a0 of Manuel Ruiz,\u00a0 without\u00a0 costs.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<\/p><p><em>Torres, Mapa, Johnson,\u00a0 Carson,<\/em>\u00a0 and\u00a0 <em>Moreland,\u00a0 JJ.,<\/em> concur.<\/p><\/div>",

Mir for a distance of twenty-two meters and ten centimeters; on the south by the property of Rojas\u00a0 Reyes &amp;\u00a0 Co., or Sr. Tiana, for a distance of twenty-two\u00a0 meters and ten\u00a0 centimeters; on the west by Calle Garcia Loranca, for a\u00a0 distance\u00a0 of\u00a0 eighteen meters and ninety\u00a0 centimeters; and on the east by a commissary building,\u00a0 for a\u00a0 distance\u00a0 of\u00a0 eighteen\u00a0 meters and ninety centimeters.'<br\/><br\/>\"At the sale of the said lot\u00a0 and improvements,\u00a0 the vendor, Jose Maria Torrejon, warranted the title thereto as appears from the wording of the contract of sale and purchase, dated June\u00a0 17, 1905\u00a0 (Exhibit\u00a0 B of the plaintiff), which states:<br\/><br\/>\"'I further covenant and agree to be responsible to the aforesaid Leopoldo Canizares Tiana,\u00a0 his\u00a0 heirs and successors\u00a0 in interest, for the property,\u00a0 and bind myself to defend the title thereto now and forever against any just claims, by whomsoever presented.'<br\/><br\/>\"Before executing the\u00a0 deed of sale to the estate in\u00a0 question, that is, on April 12, 1905, the defendant, Jose Maria Torrejon, filed\u00a0 an application in the Court of Land Registration (case No. 1440), requesting registration of the land and improvements\u00a0 (Exhibit\u00a0 A of the plaintiff; p.\u00a0 53 of the record), the same as\u00a0 described in\u00a0 Exhibit B of the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>\"Although the said Torrejon had executed the\u00a0 deed of sale to the land and\u00a0 improvements in\u00a0 favor of Tiana, he continued to prosecute the case, No. 1440, and it was heard on February 28, 1906 (Exhibit A of the plaintiff; page 76 of the record).\u00a0\u00a0 The participation and intervention, either direct or indirect, of the\u00a0 vendee Tiana, did not\u00a0 appear until March 1, 1906, when Torrejon presented a written statement to the effect\u00a0 that\u00a0 he had transferred\u00a0 all his rights in the property in\u00a0 question to Tiana.\u00a0 Tiana continued the\u00a0 prosecution of\u00a0 the case\u00a0 in the usual manner until decision therein was rendered on November 15, 1906, (p.105 of the record).\u00a0 The defendant, Jose Maria Torrejon, was\u00a0 informed of this decision, the result whereof appears in Exhibit C of the plaintiff, page 117 of the record. Tiana asked the court for\u00a0 a continuation in\u00a0 order\u00a0 to present more evidence in support\u00a0 of the requested registration of the property which is\u00a0 the. subject of the present litigation, doing this in compliance\u00a0 with instructions\u00a0 from Torrejon, as appears from the letter written by the latter, presented in this\u00a0 case as Exhibit C of the plaintiff.\u00a0 The court granted this request and continued the\u00a0 case until July 14, 1907 (pp. Ill and 112 of the record), and notification of this action by the court was transmitted to Torrejon\u00a0 (Exhibit G of the plaintiff,\u00a0 p.122\u00a0 of the record) During the period granted by the court, the plaintiff Tiana requested the\u00a0 defendant\u00a0 Torrejon, on\u00a0 various\u00a0 occasions, to bring forward the evidence required (Exhibits G, I, J, and K), but the latter failed to do so.\u00a0\u00a0 On August 8, 1908, the court\u00a0 issued a decree dismissing the application\u00a0 in case No. 1440\u00a0 and declaring the estate in question to be public property\u00a0 (p. 112 of the record,\u00a0 Exhibit A), and notification thereof was sent to Torrejon (Exhibit D of the plaintiff, p. 119\u00a0 of the record). It\u00a0 further\u00a0 appears that\u00a0 the lot with its buildings and improvements, the subject of this litigation, passed into the possession of the military authorities in the\u00a0 month of May, 1908; that the plaintiff Tiana received no payment whatsoever for it; and that, at that time, the value of it was P2,500, the amount for which Torrejon sold it to Tiana.\u00a0 Since the\u00a0 said\u00a0 month of May, 1908, or about the middle thereof, when the plaintiff in the present suit was deprived of possession, the estate has produced rent at the rate of P36 a month, of which the plaintiff has\u00a0 also been\u00a0 deprived.\u00a0 On December 14, 1909, the plaintiff Tiana\u00a0 demanded\u00a0 that the\u00a0 defendant Torrejon return or repay to him the sum of P2,500\u00a0 (Exhibit F of the plaintiff, p. 121 of the record).\u00a0\u00a0 It further appears that Torrejon knew of the Government's objection to the application in case No.\u00a0 1440 (p. 76 of the record, Exhibit A), and that the land, buildings and improvements, described in case No. 1440, were wholly included within\u00a0 the\u00a0 boundaries of\u00a0 the military\u00a0 reservation of\u00a0 Jolo, Sulu, Moro Province, P. I.<br\/><br\/>\"Finally, it appears that the land,\u00a0 buildings and improvements described and specified in case No. 1440 of the Court of\u00a0 Land Registration,\u00a0 are\u00a0 the same\u00a0 land,\u00a0 buildings\u00a0 and improvements involved in the present suit,\u00a0 described\u00a0 and specified in\u00a0 Exhibit\u00a0 B\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiff,\u00a0 page 115\u00a0 of the record, and paragraph 3 of the complaint.<br\/><br\/>\"This\u00a0 is\u00a0 an action upon the warranty of the\u00a0 title to the property in case\u00a0 of eviction, under article 1475 of the Civil Code.\u00a0 In\u00a0 such case\u00a0 there\u00a0 are three indispensable requisites:\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 Final judgment;\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 that the vendee be deprived of the\u00a0 whole\u00a0 or a part of the thing sold; and, (3)\u00a0 a right prior to\u00a0 the sale (Manresa on the Civil Code, volume 10, pages 161 to 170);\u00a0 and, finally,\u00a0 another indispensable requisite is that prescribed in article 1481 of the Civil Code: that the vendor be given notice of the suit at the instance\u00a0 of the vendee.\u00a0\u00a0 On\u00a0 the merits of the present case, and the preponderance of the plaintiff's evidence, and from the facts\u00a0 established, all the foregoing requisites\u00a0 appear herein.\u00a0 In his brief\u00a0 the defendant\u00a0 alleges that the\u00a0 decree\u00a0 issued in case No. 1440 was not final and that the\u00a0 plaintiff could\u00a0 and should have appealed from it. Such\u00a0 a case is\u00a0 expressly decided by the illustrious and learned author, Manresa, in his commentaries on the Civil Code, volume 10, page\u00a0 163, in\u00a0 the\u00a0 following manner:<br\/><br\/>\" 'Can the vendor escape\u00a0 his\u00a0 obligation\u00a0 of warranty by alleging\u00a0 that although there\u00a0 may\u00a0 be\u00a0 a\u00a0 final judgment against the vendee, such judgment became final with\u00a0 the latter's consent?\u00a0 We understand not, and that the vendee's right does not suffer the least impairment because he\u00a0 did not appeal.'<br\/><br\/>\"With reference to the allegation of the defendant, Torrejon,\u00a0 that he was not\u00a0 notified\u00a0 of the suit, that\u00a0 is, of the objection presented by\u00a0 the\u00a0 government\u00a0 in case No. 1440, he can not set up such a defense, for he was himself the applicant in that\u00a0 case, without\u00a0 the\u00a0 intervention of Tiana, and such objection on the part of the government to his\u00a0 claims already subsisted.<br\/><br\/>\"By virtue of the foregoing considerations, and of\u00a0 the facts\u00a0 established\u00a0 in this cause, the court holds that\u00a0 the plaintiff, Don Leopoldo Canizares Tiana, is entitled to\u00a0 recover from the defendant, Don Jose Maria Torrejon,\u00a0 the sum of P2,500, the price of the real estate involved\u00a0 in\u00a0 the present suit, and\u00a0 that he is also entitled to receive\u00a0 the sum of P36 a month\u00a0 from May,\u00a0 1908,\u00a0 up to the day on which\u00a0 this judgment is executed.\u00a0 With reference to\u00a0 the counterclaim of the defendant, the court is of the opinion that he has no right to recover anything from the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>\"The court sentences the defendant, Jose Maria Torrejon, to restore to Don Leopoldo Canizares Tiana,\u00a0 the sum of P2,500,\u00a0 the value\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 lot,\u00a0 buildings and improvements\u00a0 involved in\u00a0 the\u00a0 present suit, described\u00a0 and\u00a0 specified in this decision, and to pay to said Tiana P36 a month from May, 1908, up to the day on which this judgment is executed; and further sentences the defendant to pay\u00a0 the costs of this judgment.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The defendant appealed from the foregoing judgment to this court and filed a bill\u00a0 of exceptions.<br\/><br\/>Without discussing the errors assigned or reviewing\u00a0 the case more extensively, and without prejudice to the writing of a more elaborate decision, the\u00a0 judgment of the lower court is affirmed, with costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

P. Bullen.\u00a0\u00a0 At\u00a0 the time of\u00a0 the purchase the vendor was apparently the absolute owner of the property.\u00a0\u00a0 Her title was recorded in accordance with the Mortgage Law and nothing appeared upon the records or in connection with the property itself physically to give notice to purchasers or to put them upon their inquiry as to the interest of any other person in the property.\u00a0 For some years prior to 1903 the city\u00a0 of Manila had, and continuously since that time has, maintained a water main crossing the property purchased by the defendants from front to\u00a0 rear.\u00a0\u00a0 This water main was\u00a0 and is\u00a0 completely buried and, so far as\u00a0 the\u00a0 record shows, there\u00a0 is nothing whatever above ground\u00a0 to indicate its existence.\u00a0\u00a0 That said water main occupied the land\u00a0 in question, or any portion thereof, was, according to the undisputed evidence, unknown to the purchasers at the time they paid the purchase price.\u00a0 Exhibit B shows\u00a0 the land which defendants purchased of Dona Isabel Morello.\u00a0 The strip 4 meters wide and 203 meters long, the land\u00a0 in dispute in this\u00a0 action, in which the water\u00a0 main lies, is not clearly shown on that\u00a0 exhibit, but it lies\u00a0 within the parcel marked calzada en proyecto and runs approximately parallel to the axis of the same from Calle Nozaleda to the rear line of the property.<br\/><br\/>Soon\u00a0 after acquiring\u00a0 the land proceedings were begun by Mr. Bullen in the Court of Land Registration to secure ft certificate\u00a0 of title under\u00a0 Act No. 496.\u00a0 On August 15, 1904, a decree was entered ordering the registration in the name of Mr.\u00a0 Bullen of the entire tract conveyed to him by Dona Isabel\u00a0 Morello.\u00a0\u00a0 Soon thereafter the city of Manila applied to the Court of Land Registration to open its decree of registration and set aside the same in so far as it included the strip of land which is the subject of this litigation. On September 29,\u00a0 1905, the court granted\u00a0 the petition by an Order which concludes\u00a0 as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Wherefore the decree of adjudication or inscription rendered by this\u00a0 court on August 15,1904, is set aside as to that parcel of the land which begins at the northeast line of Calle Nozaleda, opposite Calle San Luis,\u00a0 crosses the remainder\u00a0 of the land described in the decree, and\u00a0 ends at the\u00a0 property of the Paulist Fathers, 4 meters wide and 202.40\u00a0 meters long, which, being the property of the city of Manila, shall be segregated from the property described on the plan of the applicant as <i>calzada en proyecto. <\/i><br\/><br\/>\"As soon as this order becomes final, let the description in the aforesaid decree and in the registry be amended so that the area above referred to shall be eliminated.\u00a0\u00a0 For this purpose counsel for the applicant shall file an amended description to be approved by counsel for the city\u00a0 of Manila.\"<\/blockquote>In the\u00a0 meantime Mr.\u00a0 Bullen died.\u00a0 His\u00a0 administrator, Mr. N. S.\u00a0 Marshall,\u00a0 presented the amended\u00a0 description required by the order of the court,\u00a0 eliminating the\u00a0 strip containing the water main,\u00a0 and describing the land as two parcels, one lying on each\u00a0 side of that strip.\u00a0\u00a0 Thereupon, the\u00a0 Court of Land Registration, on\u00a0 November 22, 1905, entered\u00a0 a decree\u00a0 in the usual form, ordering the registrar\u00a0 to issue a certificate of title for\u00a0 the\u00a0 parcels described in the amended application.<br\/><br\/>The certificate of title was duly issued,\u00a0 and thereafter several pieces of the land so registered were sold, some to the city of Manila.\u00a0 In the deed to the city the strip containing the water main was mentioned as a boundary and was referred to as the property of the city.<br\/><br\/>As soon as the contract of purchase had been entered into between the defendants and Dofla Isabel Morello, the former took possession of the entire parcel of land purchased and they have ever since remained in possession thereof, except as to those parcels which were sold from time to time.\u00a0 The strip containing the water main has been continuously in the possession of defendants from 1903 up to the present time.<br\/><br\/>We have thus, as the undisputed evidence\u00a0 in the case, the fact that\u00a0 the defendants\u00a0 bought the land\u00a0 in Question in 1904 from Dona Isabel Morello; that the vendor at that time had a\u00a0 perfect record title\u00a0 <i>(dominio inscrito<\/i>);\u00a0 that the registry disclosed no adverse claim to the\u00a0 land; that defendants, after\u00a0 diligent investigation, purchased in perfect good faith, and that\u00a0 they\u00a0 have remained continuously in possession up to the time of the initiation of this suit.<br\/><br\/>It is also undisputed that the\u00a0 city has presented no title whatever to the land\u00a0 in controversy except the opinion of Judge Del Rosario of the Court of Land Registration, dated September 29, 1905 (Exhibit C), and the proceedings\u00a0 following as a consequence of that opinion (Exhibits D and E), it being\u00a0 contended on behalf of the plaintiff that that portion of the judgment of the Court of Land Registration excluding\u00a0 from the operation of\u00a0 Act No.\u00a0 496 the land in dispute in this case is, as to the title to and ownership of said land, <i>res judicata<\/i> between\u00a0 the\u00a0 parties to this action, and that the defendants are\u00a0 estopped by that judgment from denying\u00a0 plaintiff's title. The\u00a0 evidence upon which this decision\u00a0 of the\u00a0 Court\u00a0 of Land Registration was based\u00a0 has not been presented as evidence in this case.<br\/><br\/>The question of\u00a0 the statements\u00a0 or admissions of\u00a0 the defendants or their\u00a0 immediate grantor relative to the title of the city of Manila to the land in question, as affecting the rights, of the parties to this litigation,\u00a0 has not been raised or presented\u00a0 to us by the attorney for the plaintiff and we\u00a0 have, therefore, not investigated\u00a0 or\u00a0 considered it. On the\u00a0 case as presented\u00a0 and\u00a0 argued there is only one question\u00a0 for determination, namely,\u00a0 that of the force and effect of\u00a0 the order of the Court of Land Registration excluding from registration the land in dispute, the ground\u00a0 for said exclusion being, as asserted by that\u00a0 court,\u00a0 that it belonged to the\u00a0 plaintiff in\u00a0 this action.<br\/><br\/>The Court of\u00a0 Land Registration was created for a single purpose.\u00a0 The Act isr\u00a0 entitled \"An Act to provide for\u00a0 the adjudication and registration of titles to lands in the Philippine Islands.\"\u00a0\u00a0 The sole purpose of\u00a0 the Legislature in its creation\u00a0 was to bring the land titles of the Philippine Islands under one comprehensive and harmonious system, the cardinal features of\u00a0 which\u00a0 are\u00a0 indefeasibility of\u00a0 title and the intervention of the State as a prerequisite to the creation and transfer\u00a0 of titles and interests, with\u00a0 the resultant increase in the use of land as a business asset by reason\u00a0 of the greater certainty and\u00a0 security of title.\u00a0 It does not create a title nor\u00a0 vest one.\u00a0\u00a0 It simply confirms a\u00a0 title already created and already vested, rendering it forever indefeasible.\u00a0 The\u00a0 office\u00a0 of the court is solely\u00a0 to register title. The\u00a0 effects and\u00a0 results of that registration are determined by the statute.\u00a0\u00a0 It determines, \"adjudicates\" says the title, whether\u00a0 or\u00a0 notj upon\u00a0 the\u00a0 facts presented, the\u00a0 petitioner is entitled to have an indefeasible title.\u00a0\u00a0 If he is, it is given to him,\u00a0 If not, he is\u00a0 driven from court by a dismissal of the petition with the resultant loss of jurisdiction over the whole proceeding.\u00a0\u00a0 This is its sole function - to confirm and register.\u00a0\u00a0 It is,\u00a0 therefore, a court\u00a0 with jurisdiction over a particular subject matter,\u00a0 which subject matter is to be dealt with to a special end.\u00a0\u00a0 While the power of the court over\u00a0 its subject\u00a0 matter is plenary, it is so only for certain clearly specified\u00a0 purposes and to effectuate\u00a0 only clearly specified ends.<br\/><br\/>Before the creation\u00a0 of the Court of Land Registration, jurisdiction\u00a0 to\u00a0 determine the nature, quality, and\u00a0 extent of land titles, the\u00a0 rival claims of parties contending therefor, of their registration (in its former sense), and the legality and effect thereof\u00a0 was vested in the\u00a0 Courts\u00a0 of First Instance of the Islands.\u00a0 They had complete and\u00a0 exclusive jurisdiction there over.\u00a0 By the passage of Act No. 496 these courts were deprived under certain conditions of the power of determining some of these questions and\u00a0 of adjudicating in relation to\u00a0 certain aspects of others.\u00a0\u00a0 To be sure, the court created by that Act deals with the subject matter in a manner entirely new and with regard to\u00a0 which no court\u00a0 of the\u00a0 Islands previously had\u00a0 had power or authority.\u00a0\u00a0 But it is none the less true that in acting in that manner it resolves questions and determines rights\u00a0 which theretofore had\u00a0 been recognized\u00a0 originally $nd exclusively by Courts oi First Instance.\u00a0 By that Act, therefore, two things occurred worthy of note in the connection in\u00a0 which we are discussing it: First, a court of limited\u00a0 jurisdiction, with\u00a0 special subject matter,\u00a0 and\u00a0 with only one purpose, was created,\u00a0 Second, by reason thereof courts, theretofore of general, original, and exclusive jurisdiction, were shorn of some of their attributes and deprived of certain of their power; in other words, their powers were restricted.\u00a0 This being true, we are confident that, in determining the power and authority of Courts of Land Registration, which determination is fundamental in the decision of the case at bar, there should be applied the\u00a0 general principle of the law that in\u00a0 all cases of special tribunals their jurisdiction is strictly confined\u00a0 and never excludes the courts of ordinary jurisdiction except upon the clearest direction of the legislative will.\u00a0 (Fidelity Trust Co. <i>vs<\/i>.\u00a0 Gitt Car Co., 25 Fed.

The proceedings upon such applications shall be proceedings in rem against the land and the buildings and improvements thereon and the decrees shall operate directly\u00a0 on the land and the buildings and improvements thereon, and vest and establish title thereto.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The latter portion of this section should be particularly noted, especially that portion which says that the \"decrees\" of the court \"shall operate directly on\u00a0 the land\u00a0 and vest and\u00a0 establish title thereto.\"\u00a0 It is the\u00a0 land registered to which the statute directs attention.\u00a0 It is that upon which the decree of the court operates.\u00a0 This is a necessary result of the fact\u00a0 that the whole purpose and object of the\u00a0 law and the court is, as we have\u00a0 already said, to\u00a0 register title to land.\u00a0\u00a0 Every sentence\u00a0 of\u00a0 the law\u00a0 bends itself to this end and every power given to the court is granted for that results It touches no other purpose; has no other object; produces no other result.\u00a0 Section 88 provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"If the court after hearing finds that the applicant\u00a0 has title as stated in his application, and proper for registration, a decree of\u00a0 confirmation and\u00a0 registration shall be entered. Every decree of registration shall\u00a0 bind the land, and quiet title\u00a0 thereto, subject only to the exceptions stated\u00a0 in\u00a0 the following section.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Here again we see the\u00a0 whole force and purpose\u00a0 of\u00a0 the court\u00a0 directed to\u00a0 the\u00a0 title of the land registered.\u00a0 The decree under the Act can contain no other matter than that which relates to the title of the land actually registered. By express\u00a0 terms\u00a0 it can serve no purpose not related to the land <i>registered.<\/i>\u00a0 Indeed, it is the decree, or a certified copy\u00a0 thereof, which\u00a0 <i>constitutes<\/i> the title of the applicant. Here is what it shall contain:<br\/><blockquote>\"Sec. 40. Every decree of registration shall bear the\u00a0 day of the year, hour, and minute of\u00a0 its entry,\u00a0 and shall be signed by the clerk.\u00a0 It shall state whether the\u00a0 owner is married\u00a0 or\u00a0 unmarried, and if married, the name\u00a0 of\u00a0 the husband or\u00a0 wife.\u00a0\u00a0 If the owner is under disability, it shall state the nature of the disability, and if a minor, shall state his age.\u00a0 It shall contain a\u00a0 description\u00a0 of\u00a0 the land\u00a0 as finally determined by the court, and shall set forth the estate of the owner, and also, in such manner as to show their relative\u00a0 priority, all\u00a0 particular estates,\u00a0 mortgages, easements, liens, attachments, and other incumbrances,\u00a0 including rights of husband or wife, if any, to which \u00a3he land or owner's estate is subject and may contain any other matter properly to be determined in pursuance of this Act.\u00a0 The decree shall be stated in a convenient form for transcription upon\u00a0 the certificates of title hereinafter\u00a0 mentioned.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>This is the method of giving a paper title:<br\/><blockquote>\"SEC. 41.

It is quite different from\u00a0 an\u00a0 answer\u00a0 permitted by\u00a0 law in actions in Courts of First Instance.\u00a0 It has two requisites: It <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">shall <\/span>set forth \"all the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">objections\u00a0<\/span> to the application\" and shall set forth the \"interest claimed by the party filing the same.\" Nothing more is\u00a0 required.\u00a0\u00a0 Inasmuch\u00a0 as\u00a0 the\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"interest\" of the respondent is nowhere again mentioned throughout the whole extent of the\u00a0 law, it is but fair to assume that the real purpose of the provision which contains mention of\u00a0 such interest was to require\u00a0 the answer to disclose the objections to the application, the requirement that the opponent show his interest\u00a0 being\u00a0 merely for the purpose of making plain, full and clear the objections to the application.\u00a0 No joinder of issue\u00a0 by a general denial is permitted.\u00a0 The reason is obvious.\u00a0 When an issue is joined by general denial, the relative rights\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 contending parties must be\u00a0 determined.\u00a0 The action\u00a0 then\u00a0 becomes, generally speaking, a personal one.\u00a0 The contest under the general\u00a0 practice and\u00a0 procedure is\u00a0 between the personal rights of the one and the other.\u00a0\u00a0 The judgment is equally binding upon both; but it binds <i>nobody else and nothing else.<\/i> The joinder of an\u00a0 issue by general denial would therefore be in a way inconsistent with an action in the Land Court. One whose only right is to object has no need of a joinder of issue\u00a0 by a general denial.\u00a0 Moreover, the requirement that he \"state\u00a0 all the objections\u00a0 to the\u00a0 application\" imposes upon\u00a0 him much more than he would\u00a0 perform if he merely denied.\u00a0 A denial throws the burden of taking\u00a0 the next step\u00a0 on the\u00a0 petitioner.\u00a0 It asserts\u00a0 nothing and\u00a0 shows nothing.\u00a0 It presents\u00a0 no facts, discloses no rights, offers no reasons.\u00a0 Yet by virtue of it\u00a0 the necessity of taking\u00a0 the next step in the proceeding is put on the petitioner.\u00a0 But this is not the procedure required by the nature of the proceeding.\u00a0\u00a0 That requires not that the petitioner shall demonstrate something to the respondent, but that the respondent shall demonstrate something to the court; not that the petitioner shall, show reasons for proceeding, but rather that the respondent\u00a0 shall\u00a0 affirmatively show reasons\u00a0 why\u00a0 the applicant should not\u00a0 proceed.\u00a0 In other\u00a0 words, the\u00a0 respondent must by his answer, irrespective of the allegations of the petition, present reasons which of themselves show that the petitioner is not entitled to have the title to the land registered.\u00a0 He must\u00a0 fully expose\u00a0 his case - in short, demonstrate what he is going to prove - before he is allowed to enter court.\u00a0\u00a0 To be sure, such objections may, under certain circumstances, constitute\u00a0 in effect a\u00a0 general denial, but they always constitute either much more or much less.<br\/><br\/>From section 34 we also see that no affirmative relief can be asked for in the answer.\u00a0\u00a0 This is entirely consistent with the\u00a0 theory that the respondent is merely an objector, one who prevents but\u00a0 can not obtain.\u00a0 It is a general rule\u00a0 of pleading and\u00a0 practice that to obtain affirmative relief it is necessary to make sufficient affirmative\u00a0 allegations in the answer to show that the pleader is entitled thereto.\u00a0 Indeed, proof going to establish a right\u00a0 to such relief can not be admitted on the trial in the absence of such allegations\u00a0 in the\u00a0 answer.\u00a0\u00a0 The Act\u00a0 (No.\u00a0 496) provides a complete system of\u00a0 procedure\u00a0 for the court it creates.\u00a0 Except in certain cases not of\u00a0 importance in the present discussion, no part of the practice in Courts of First\u00a0 Instance\u00a0 is\u00a0 made applicable to\u00a0 the\u00a0 Court of Land Registration.\u00a0 The\u00a0 form and nature of the pleadings,\u00a0 the practice and procedure followed, are determined by the provisions of\u00a0 the\u00a0 Act.\u00a0\u00a0 It would ordinarily be presumed that, there being no pleading in which the respondent can\u00a0 assert his rights to affirmative relief, it was not\u00a0 the\u00a0 intention of the law that he should have such relief.<br\/><br\/>That\u00a0 such is the case is still further shown by the provisions of section 37.\u00a0 It reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"If in any case the court finds that the applicant has not proper title for registration, a decree shall be entered dismissing the application, and such decree may be ordered to be without\u00a0 prejudice.\u00a0 The\u00a0 applicant\u00a0 may withdraw his application <i>at any\u00a0 time before final decree,<\/i> upon terms to be fixed by the court.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Under this section the rights of the respondent, as a party litigant\u00a0 under ordinary practice and procedure, are wholly disregarded.\u00a0\u00a0 Matters proceed\u00a0 precisely as if he were not there.\u00a0\u00a0 If the respondent were entitled to affirmative relief, such as a final determination of the interest he has in the land in question, the dismissal or withdrawal of the application would be a prejudice to such right which\u00a0 could not be\u00a0 permitted under the practice of any court.\u00a0 It would be clearly unjust and indefensible for a\u00a0 court to,refuse to pass upon the facts which he had presented to substantiate his rights and calmly dismiss the petition without prejudice to the applicant again to\u00a0 bring the respondent into court with the same futile result to his rights.\u00a0 The conclusion is, therefore,\u00a0 inevitable that it is the intention of the Act to give the\u00a0 respondent no\u00a0 relief whatever except\u00a0 that purely negative\u00a0 in character.\u00a0 He can defend but not attack.\u00a0 He can prevent but not obtain.\u00a0\u00a0 He is a dog in the manger.<br\/><br\/>That this is true is still further demonstrated by that portion of section 36 which reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"If in any case an appearance is entered and answer filed, the case shall be set down for hearing\u00a0 on motion of either party,\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.\u00a0 The court may hear the parties and their evidence\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *.\u00a0 If two or\u00a0 more applicants claim\u00a0 the same land, or part of the same land, the court may order the hearings\u00a0 upon all such\u00a0 applications to be consolidated, if such consolidation\u00a0 is\u00a0 in the\u00a0 interest of\u00a0 economy of time and expense.\"<\/blockquote>This latter provision points out the only way whereby one who desires to object to the registration of land in\u00a0 the name of another and at the same time secure an\u00a0 affirmative pronouncement touching his own rights and interests may do so.\u00a0 <i>He must himself become an applicant. <\/i> The provisions of the Act\u00a0 seem\u00a0 to\u00a0 be so\u00a0 set upon preventing\u00a0 affirmative relief to a respondent that\u00a0 he must <i>totally change, his character as a\u00a0 litigant<\/i> before he can\u00a0 secure that\u00a0 advantage. When he\u00a0 is able\u00a0 to obtain\u00a0 affirmative relief he\u00a0 has\u00a0 ceased to be a respondent.<br\/><br\/>It appears from every line of the Act\u00a0 that the court is given power to deal with only one kind of title and that ip a title \"<i>proper for registration\"\u00a0 <\/i> There appears in the law not a word authorizing the court to determine or adjudicate upon any title less than or different from that.\u00a0 Every other\u00a0 title whenever or however or by whomever presented is a matter of utter indifference to the court, so far as its powers of adjudication are concerned.\u00a0 While it may consider the interest or title presented by the answer and proofs\u00a0 of a respondent,\u00a0 such consideration\u00a0 is not for the purpose of determining that title but simply for the purpose of determining: how that title\u00a0 or\u00a0 interest <i>affects the title of the petitioner.<\/i>\u00a0 That title or interest is not considered for the purpose of decreeing anything in favor of him who presents it, but solely to determine the registrability of <i>petitioners title. <\/i> The court, as we have said, deals with <i>one kind of title\u00a0 only,<\/i> that is a\u00a0 title fit\u00a0 for registration.\u00a0 It does not deal with the <i>relative strength of title between the applicant and the respondent.<\/i>\u00a0\u00a0 With relative rights, as such, the court has nothing to do.\u00a0\u00a0 It\u00a0 is very possible that neither party may\u00a0 have a title \"proper for registration.\"\u00a0 If so, no matter how much stronger may be the rights of one than those of the other, the court\u00a0 has\u00a0 no\u00a0 power to adjudicate\u00a0 with reference thereto. They must\u00a0 be relegated to the courts of general jurisdiction\u00a0 for the\u00a0 proper\u00a0 remedy.\u00a0 The applicant may have a\u00a0 right\u00a0 in the\u00a0 land which\u00a0 he seeks to register wholly superior to that\u00a0 of the respondent, and yet not have an interest \"proper for\u00a0 registration,\"\u00a0 The matter before the court for\u00a0 determination is quite apart from the relative rights of petitioner\u00a0 and opponent.\u00a0 The question is, \"Is this title proper for registration?\"\u00a0 And\u00a0 the rights of petitioner and opponent are wholly unimportant except in\u00a0 so far as\u00a0 they throw light\u00a0 upon\u00a0 that question.\u00a0 The proceeding is not only\u00a0 against the respondent but <i>against the world;<\/i> and the court can\u00a0 not permit a faulty\u00a0 title to be registered simply because it\u00a0 happens\u00a0 to be\u00a0 better than a still more faulty one presented by a single answering defendant.\u00a0 The court\u00a0 deals\u00a0 with\u00a0 all\u00a0 the\u00a0 world.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 <i>relative rights <\/i>of A and B are, strictly speaking,\u00a0 of no consequence except as they assist the court in making\u00a0 a\u00a0 just decree against the\u00a0 world. The function of the court is to determine, in a sense, absolute rights, not relative rights.\u00a0 This seems to be indicated by the fact that the rights which its judgments establish are absolutely indefeasible.<br\/><br\/>It is our\u00a0 conclusion', therefore, that the Court of Land Registration\u00a0 has no authority or power,\u00a0 by judgment or decree, to adjudicate rights in land not registered.\u00a0 The fact that it is a court of special, though not inferior, jurisdiction, that\u00a0 its procedure is summary, that it acts in rem rather than\u00a0 <i>in personam,<\/i> that it is authorized to serve its process by advertisement and mailing as well as personally, compel us to think\u00a0 that its\u00a0 activities should\u00a0 be strictly. limited to the purpose of\u00a0 its\u00a0 creation.\u00a0\u00a0 While under the wording\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 Act\u00a0 it has\u00a0 \"exclusive jurisdiction of all applications under this Act of title to land\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 <i>with power to\u00a0 hear and determine all questions arising upon such application,\"<\/i>\u00a0 that jurisdiction\u00a0 is restricted by\u00a0 the nature of its functions and the purposes for which it was created. The whole scope, tenor, and purpose of the Act is to limit the functions of the court to the <i>registration<\/i> of titles.\u00a0 The instant that any part of the land presented for registration is excluded therefrom, it resumes its original status as to everybody and for every purpose, and the rights and interests of persons therein remain to be determined\u00a0 in the ordinary\u00a0 courts of law precisely the same as if such land had never been before the\u00a0 Court of Land Registration.<br\/><br\/>This court has already gone some way on this road.\u00a0 In the case of Tecson <i>vs.<\/i> Corporacion de PP. Dominicos,<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> filed with the clerk March 16, 1911,\u00a0 the respondent made objection to the maintenance of the proceedings to register the title to the lands in question upon the ground that there was already pending in the same court at the time this proceeding was begun a proceeding by the respondent as applicant to register the title to the same lands and that the applicant here was\u00a0 a respondent there.\u00a0 In\u00a0 meeting that objection this court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"In reply to this contention it is\u00a0 necessary to say only that this court has held heretofore that the jurisdiction of the Land Court extends no further than the inscription of the land described in the final decree, and the enforcement of that decree, and that even though the land described in the petition be found by the court, as between the petitioner and the <i>opositor<\/i>, to be the property of the <i>opositor,<\/i> such land can not be inscribed in his name, the Land Court having; as we have said, no jurisdiction or\u00a0 power to do so.\u00a0 It naturally and necessarily follows that the opponent,\u00a0 if he desires the land of which he claims ownership to be registered in accordance with law, must begin a new proceeding in the Land Court\u00a0 for that purpose.\"\u00a0 (Foss <i>vs<\/i>. Atkins, 201\u00a0 Mass.,\u00a0 158; same case, 204 Mass.,\u00a0 337; Smith <i>vs<\/i>. Crissman, 41 Colo., 450.)<br\/><\/blockquote>In the case of Foss <i>vs<\/i>. Atkins (204\u00a0 Mass., 337), cited in that case, it appeared\u00a0 that the petitioner,\u00a0 Foss, duly filed a petition for registering the title to a. certain tract of land in Province town.\u00a0 The judge of the Land Court later filed a decision in which he found that the petitioner had title to a part of the land and the respondents to the rest.\u00a0 Later the petitioner filed a motion to dismiss the petition without prejudice.\u00a0\u00a0 This motion was never\u00a0 acted on by the court. Notwithstanding its\u00a0 pendency,\u00a0 the\u00a0 Land\u00a0 Court\u00a0 allowed a motion of respondents to substitute themselves as petitioners for registration as to so much of the land as had been found by the prior decision of the land\u00a0 court\u00a0 to belong to them. A decree was accordingly\u00a0 entered declaring\u00a0 respondents owners of such part and that their title\u00a0 should be registered.\u00a0 Still later the original petitioner, Foss, filed a motion to withdraw his petition for a registration upon such terms as the court might fix. The court denied this motion on the ground that there had\u00a0 already been\u00a0 entered a final decree of registration in favor of\u00a0 respondents.\u00a0 There was no decision respecting the title to the land found by the Land Court\u00a0 to belong to the petitioner.\u00a0 That matter was still pending at the time of the decision in the case of which we are speaking.\u00a0\u00a0 The point before the court for decision was whether a decree having as its only foundation the right of a respondent to obtain affirmative relief by being substituted in place of the petitioner was valid.\u00a0 In deciding this question the court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"There is no principle of 'procedure or practice either in personal actions or in proceedings in rem nor *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 any provision in R. L. c. 128, which authorizes the Land Court to allow an amendment by which the respondent becomes the petitioner and the petitioner the\u00a0 respondent.\u00a0\u00a0 If the' respondents 'had wished to become' petitioners they\u00a0 'should have brought' their 'own petition.'\u00a0 The only decree, therefore, which has been entered is\u00a0 one\u00a0 based wholly upon a pleading which not merely ought not to have been allowed, but which brought before the court a subject which could not under the law come\u00a0 before it\u00a0 in\u00a0 that\u00a0 proceeding.\u00a0 It was not an incidental or collateral error in\u00a0 the progress of a cause,\u00a0 which must be seasonably objected to in order to be corrected.\u00a0 It was a fundamental procedure introducing an issue\u00a0 calling for action affirmative in its nature alien to and incompatible\u00a0 with the pending\u00a0 petition.\u00a0 It brought in a subject beyond the jurisdiction of the Land Court under any petition before\u00a0 it.\u00a0 This is not\u00a0 a decree\u00a0 combining matters partly within the scope of the original petition and partly\u00a0 upon an amendment which\u00a0 the\u00a0 court had no right to allow, but it is one having no relation to any other subject than the extra jurisdictional\u00a0 one.\u00a0 A\u00a0 decree thus\u00a0 wholly beyond the jurisdiction of the court is void, and may be so treated by any\u00a0 party\u00a0 to\u00a0 the\u00a0 proceeding.\u00a0 It follows\u00a0 that the withdrawal of the petition by the petitioner was seasonably filed, and should have been allowed.\u00a0\u00a0 (McQuesten <i>vs<\/i>. Commonwealth, 198 Mass., 172.)\u00a0 Although it was pointed out in 201 Mass., at page 161, that the simple and complete remedy of the petitioner\u00a0 was by appeal directly from, the Land\u00a0 Court to this court, it was nevertheless possible\u00a0 to raise the question of law by the more cumbersome method of exception.\u00a0\u00a0 (R. L. c.\u00a0 128, par. 13; c.\u00a0 173,\u00a0 par. 106.\u00a0 McCusker <i>vs<\/i>. Geiger, 195 Mass., 46.)\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In the case of Smith <i>vs<\/i>. Crissman, above, it was urged before the supreme court of Colorado that the land registration act of that State, which, as to the point under consideration, is, in its provisions, in all essential respects the same as Act No. 496,\u00a0 was in violation\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 constitution\u00a0 of that State and also of the fourteenth amendment to the Federal Constitution on the\u00a0 ground that\u00a0 there\u00a0 was\u00a0 a failure\u00a0 of due process of law in that it did not provide for an affirmative judgment in favor of an answering defendant, the only decree permissible being one of dismissal if the applicant did not show title proper for registration.\u00a0\u00a0 In discussing that question the court said:<br\/><br\/>\"The further contention is that the act\u00a0 is not due\u00a0 process of law in that it fails to provide for an affirmative judgment in favor of a\u00a0 defendant, the only decree permissible being one of dismissal in case the court, after hearing, finds that the applicant has not title proper for registration.\u00a0 The act does accord to all persons equal\u00a0 rights and privileges. Any one desiring to avail himself of\u00a0 its terms can do so by filing his application, and\u00a0 can obtain\u00a0 the registration of his title by\u00a0 complying\u00a0 with\u00a0 the requirements of the statute.\u00a0 Although the legislature has seen fit to allow affirmative relief only to the applicant who initiates the proceeding, this does not render the proceeding objectionable for the reason assigned.\u00a0 The right to a particular remedy is not a vested right.\u00a0\u00a0 Every state has complete control\u00a0 over the remedies which\u00a0 it offers to suitors in\u00a0 its courts.\u00a0\u00a0 (Cooley's Const. Lim., 515.)<br\/><blockquote>\"It is only by virtue of the statute that a defendant\u00a0 may avail himself of affirmative relief by way\u00a0 of set-off or counterclaim.\u00a0 It was, therefore, clearly, within the province of the legislature to limit the relief .afforded by the statute to the applicant who initiates the\u00a0 proceeding.\"<\/blockquote>There are some other reasons for holding that the jurisdiction of the Court of Land Registration to determine title to or interest\u00a0 in land extends no further than\u00a0 to the\u00a0 land actually included in the\u00a0 decree of registration.\u00a0\u00a0 Under the statute that court is given no power to execute any judgment save that which relates to the land registered.\u00a0\u00a0 If the statement of Judge Del Rosario constitutes a binding adjudication in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants in this action, then there ought to be power in the court to enforce that judgment. We do not think, however, that the assertion\u00a0 that there\u00a0 is an\u00a0 absolute failure of such power will be questioned.\u00a0 Generally speaking, courts of law are not constituted to decide questions purely academic, and the fact that a court lacks the\u00a0 power to enforce a decision goes far\u00a0 toward proving\u00a0 that\u00a0 such decision is not within its authority.\u00a0 This is particularly true of a court of\u00a0 special and limited jurisdiction.<br\/><br\/>Again, if the judgment relied upon as <i>res judicata<\/i> in this case were really such and therefore conclusive, the defendants would be deprived of all recourse against their grantor upon the warranty of title\u00a0 contained in their deed; or the warrantor would be deprived of an opportunity to maintain defendants' title in\u00a0 the\u00a0 courts.\u00a0 Articles 1474\u00a0 to 1483, inclusive,\u00a0 of the Civil Code provide that the. purchaser of land may enforce the warranty\u00a0 of the vendor only when he has been dispossessed by a final judgment obtained by reason of a defect in the title preceding the purchase; and as a condition\u00a0 precedent to enforcing the warranty, the purchaser must\u00a0 give notice to his vendor, the warrantor, of the action for possession, in order that the warrantor may intervene and defend the title.\u00a0 In the case before us there was no way by\u00a0 which Dona Isabel Morello could take part in the proceedings in the Court of Land Registration after the city had made its application to amend the decree of registration.\u00a0 It is unquestioned that that court would have had no jurisdiction to take cognizance of such an\u00a0 intervention or to render judgment against defendants' vendor on the warranty.\u00a0 In fact, the possession\u00a0 of\u00a0 the land here in controversy was never in question in that court after the city intervened.\u00a0\u00a0 The fact\u00a0 that Dona\u00a0 Isabel Morello was actually a party is of no consequence in view of the indisputable proposition that the Land Court has no power or authority to render any judgment in any sense adequate to meet the situation presented by her presence.<br\/><br\/>For these reasons the judgment is reversed and the complaint dismissed upon the merits.<br\/><br\/><i> Carson<\/i> and <i>Trent,\u00a0 JJ.,<\/i> concur.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

The court committed an error of fact and of law by setting\u00a0 aside, omitting or\u00a0 not deciding,\u00a0 by\u00a0 allowing or denying on the day of the hearings on motions (called Law Day, which\u00a0 is Monday)\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant's motion,\u00a0 duly and properly filed in the\u00a0 office of the\u00a0 clerk of the court twelve days before\u00a0 the hearing of the case, for a suspension\u00a0 of the new trial, notwithstanding the practice of\u00a0 the court of deciding on\u00a0 such day analogous motions on other matters pending final hearing.<br\/><br\/>\"2. The court\u00a0 also committed an error of fact and of law by allowing\u00a0 the furtive and illegal motion presented by the plaintiff and by\u00a0 allowing judgment by default against the defendant, who\u00a0 had\u00a0 duly appeared,\u00a0 filed his\u00a0 answer\u00a0 and a counterclaim for P5,000, establishing as a foundation for such ruling\u00a0 three gratuitous and false suppositions against the\u00a0 defendant, and by disallowing the motion for a revocation of the said judgment by default.<br\/><br\/>\"3. The court committed an error of fact and of law by sentencing the defendant in its judgment of November 27, 1906, to the payment of P1,021.97, with interest, for salary claimed by the plaintiff to which the latter was not entitled, nor\u00a0 did he present as proof\u00a0 any document whatever\u00a0 in support of his pretended credit, or any other proof of his claim.<br\/><br\/>\"4. The court also committed an error of\u00a0 law\u00a0 by denying the defendant's motion for the annulment of the judgment and\u00a0 for a new hearing\u00a0 of the case\u00a0 on the grounds\u00a0 that the sentence was contrary to law and the evidence.<br\/><br\/>\"5. It was\u00a0 an error of law and a capital one for the court to have executed its judgment without therein having ordered such execution, and not to have annulled the execution of the judgment which had not\u00a0 become\u00a0 final when the excepting defendant's motion for a new trial was still pending decision.<br\/><br\/>\"6. The court committed\u00a0 essential and prejudicial errors and\u00a0 irregularity in its proceedings by not\u00a0 having notified the defendant or his attorney in the matter of the formation of the docket of cases for trial,\u00a0 by not\u00a0 summoning\u00a0 him for the\u00a0 hearing of the\u00a0 present case or granting his petition that he be furnished\u00a0 copies of the plaintiff's briefs,\u00a0 and by not\u00a0 ordering a\u00a0 record made of the defendant's\u00a0 exceptions and of his notice of intention to file a bill of exceptions, thus compelling the defendant to record\u00a0 them\u00a0 himself in a petition.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The assignments of error designated under\u00a0 numbers 3 and\u00a0 4 must\u00a0 immediately be\u00a0 dismissed, since,\u00a0 as already stated, the sentence has been found to be manifestly proper and just, in view of the\u00a0 facts declared in the judgment to have\u00a0 been proved,\u00a0 and\u00a0 certainly\u00a0 this\u00a0 court\u00a0 must\u00a0 accept them as such, as no review\u00a0 of the\u00a0 evidence\u00a0 can\u00a0 be had for the reasons before\u00a0 set forth.<br\/><br\/>The first error alleged by the appellant, even supposing it\u00a0 really to be such, can\u00a0 not,in the least affect the judgment appealed from, inasmuch as it relates to a\u00a0 proceeding commended to the discretion of the court, as is that of the suspension of the hearing of the\u00a0 case, not subject\u00a0 to exception, according to the\u00a0 definite and express provisions of the law.\u00a0 (Sec. 141, Code of Civil Procedure.)<br\/><br\/>The facts connected with the third ground of the appeal, are the following: The defendant having been summoned by virtue\u00a0 of the\u00a0 complaint which gave rise to the action, appeared at the hearing in due time and filed his answer in which he made a counterclaim for the\u00a0 sum of P5,000. On the\u00a0 day set for\u00a0 the hearing of\u00a0 the case\u00a0 the plaintiff appeared,\u00a0 but not the\u00a0 defendant nor his attorney, wherefore, and\u00a0 upon written motion\u00a0 made\u00a0 for\u00a0 the\u00a0 purpose by the plaintiff, the court declared the said defendant to be in default\u00a0 and ordered the\u00a0 trial\u00a0 to proceed,\u00a0\u00a0 hearing the plaintiff's\u00a0 evidence and rendering afterwards,\u00a0 grounded thereon, the judgment which is\u00a0 the subject of the present appeal.<br\/><br\/>Section\u00a0 128 of the Code of Civil Procedure\u00a0 provides as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"In case a defendant fails to appear at the time required in the summons, or to\u00a0 answer at the time provided by the rules of court, the court shall, upon motion of\u00a0 the plaintiff, order judgment for the\u00a0 plaintiff by\u00a0 default\u00a0\u00a0 which shall be entered upon the\u00a0 docket;\u00a0 and the court\u00a0 shall thereupon proceed to hear the plaintiff and his witnesses and assess the damages or determine the\u00a0 other\u00a0 relief to which the plaintiff may be entitled, including the costs of the action, and render final judgment for the plaintiff to recover such sum or to\u00a0 receive such other relief as the pleadings\u00a0 and the facts warrant.\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In accordance\u00a0 with\u00a0 this provision,\u00a0 only the defendant who fails to appear at the\u00a0 hearing within the\u00a0 time set in the summons or who, having\u00a0 appeared, does not answer the complaint within the\u00a0 period fixed by the\u00a0 rules of the court, may be declared to be in default. The herein appellant isjnot within this\u00a0 rule since he did appear and did file his\u00a0 answer\u00a0 to the\u00a0 complaint\u00a0 in\u00a0 due time, as shown by the bill Of exceptions. The order of the court whereby\u00a0 he was declared\u00a0 to\u00a0 be in\u00a0 default is, therefore,\u00a0 erroneous and consequently the second assignment of error made in the appellant's brief is well founded.<br\/><br\/>Such error, however, turns out to be merely technical in the present case.\u00a0\u00a0 In reality it has had no bearing whatever on the course or on the decision of the case, neither has it in the slightest degree prejudiced the defendant's rights. The complaint having been answered, and the assignment of the date for the hearing of the case having been publicly made, as it was, in the docket of the\u00a0 court for a certain day, the 26th of November, 1906, and the defendant\u00a0 being duly\u00a0 informed of the setting\u00a0 of\u00a0 such\u00a0 date, as\u00a0 shown by his petition of November\u00a0 14th,\u00a0 wherein he moved\u00a0 for a suspension of the hearing\u00a0 (p. 4 of the bill of exceptions), even though he may have mistakenly believed that the date set was that\u00a0 of\u00a0 November 16th\u00a0 instead of the 26th, on the arrival of this latter date it was entirely optional and discretional on the\u00a0 part of the\u00a0 court either to suspend or proceed with the hearing on that day, even in the defendant's\u00a0 absence and without the need of declaring him\u00a0 in default\u00a0 as it seems,\u00a0 was erroneously done.\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore the declaration of default has neither altered nor impaired the defendant's\u00a0 status upon the trial, for even without\u00a0 such pronouncement the case would have followed\u00a0 exactly the same\u00a0 course which it has in fact, as its hearing on the day set was not suspended\u00a0 by\u00a0 the\u00a0 court.\u00a0 Practically, nothing was done at the trial after the declaration of default that could\u00a0 not have been done\u00a0 with perfect legality though no such\u00a0 declaration\u00a0 had been\u00a0 made.\u00a0 Hence, the pronouncement\u00a0 of default has not in\u00a0 reality prejudiced any\u00a0 real right of the defendant and can not, therefore, even though erroneous,\u00a0 serve\u00a0 as a ground for a reversal of\u00a0 the\u00a0 judgment appealed from.\u00a0 It is a firmly established rule of\u00a0 this\u00a0 court and a definite provision of the\u00a0 law, that no judgment shall b.e, reversed on formal or\u00a0 technical grounds, or for\u00a0 such error\u00a0 as has not prejudiced any real\u00a0 rights of the appellant party.\u00a0 (Sec.\u00a0 503, Code of Civil Procedure.)<br\/><br\/>The fifth assignment of error refers to the execution of the judgment, that is,\u00a0 to the proceedings had\u00a0 subsequent to the latter and can not, for this very reason, affect its execution in any case.\u00a0\u00a0 Besides, it is\u00a0 beyond all doubt that judges\u00a0 may order\u00a0 the\u00a0 execution\u00a0 of\u00a0 a positive judgment pronounced by them, even before it becomes final and executory, whenever there are special reasons therefor, the determination of which is of course left to their good judgment and discretion.\u00a0 (Sec.\u00a0 144, Code of Civil Procedure.)<br\/><br\/>With respect to the sixth and last ground of appeal, it is sufficient to say, in order to show that it\u00a0 lacks real and practical importance, that the defendant was\u00a0 in fact informed of the date set for the hearing of the case, as proved by his\u00a0 having asked, before the holding of the trial, for a suspension of\u00a0 the said hearing until\u00a0 the next session of the court.\u00a0\u00a0 His\u00a0 acknowledgment at\u00a0 the trial of\u00a0 his\u00a0 cognizance of the setting of the\u00a0 date for\u00a0 the hearing produces, in law, the effect of remedying the omission of the summons or notification of the said date,\u00a0 even\u00a0 supposing that\u00a0 there really\u00a0 was\u00a0 such an omission, which\u00a0 certainly\u00a0 appears\u00a0 to be denied by the bill of\u00a0 exceptions in the\u00a0 records of the court.\u00a0\u00a0 And the mistake\u00a0 into which\u00a0 the defendant apparently\u00a0 fell, according to his own\u00a0 allegation,\u00a0 can not avail against the statements\u00a0 made in the\u00a0 preceding\u00a0 paragraph, because reference\u00a0 is made only\u00a0 to dates and\u00a0 not to\u00a0 the setting\u00a0 in itself of a date.\u00a0 Once informed\u00a0 that the\u00a0 case was set for trial,\u00a0 it was extremely easy to ascertain\u00a0 the true date determined for the\u00a0 hearing,\u00a0 had he really desired to be\u00a0 present at the trial. We find nothing in\u00a0 the record to show that the\u00a0 defendants' nonappearance at the trial was due to\u00a0 any\u00a0 other cause\u00a0 than that\u00a0 of his own neglect and carelessness.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 judgment appealed from is affirmed,\u00a0 with the\u00a0 costs of this instance\u00a0 against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i> Arellano, C.

Since the proposed building, like the rest of the locations included in the classification of streets of the first class, is situated on the water front of the municipality of Cebu, where all the steamers load and discharge and where warehouses and storerooms are very necessary to facilitate Cebu's commerce, the attempted prohibition of this kind of building in said district on the part of the municipal council is not only unreasonable but also indefensible;<\/p><p>\"(<em>d<\/em>) Even\u00a0 though the\u00a0 municipal council\u00a0 of Cebu\u00a0 had authority to regulate the style and exact size of buildings, which authority it does not have, still such authority confers no right to require the ornamentation and decoration of such buildings exactly like others, as is attempted\u00a0 in paragraph 13 of ordinance No. 3, nor to require buildings of two, three or other number of stories, because such regulations constitute an illegal\u00a0 and vexatious interference with property rights, the general rule being that laws and ordinances of municipalities regulating buildings will interfere with property rights and the free exercise thereof only to the extent necessary for\u00a0 guarding the\u00a0 'public welfare.'\u00a0\u00a0 If a municipality has the right to require or to exact buildings of three stories, why not of ten or of twenty?<\/p><p>\" (<em>e<\/em>) That the officials of the municipality of Cebu should issue the permit or license requested by the plaintiff for the construction of the\u00a0 building projected in accordance\u00a0 with the plans approved by the Government architect;<\/p><p>\"(<em>f<\/em>)\u00a0 That neither\u00a0 said\u00a0 municipality nor\u00a0 any officer thereof has any right to interfere with or\u00a0 in any manner hinder the construction of\u00a0 said building.<\/p><p align=\"center\">\"JUDGMENT.<\/p><blockquote><p>\"In consequence of the findings and\u00a0 conclusions set forth above, the court\u00a0 declares ordinance No. 100,\u00a0 as well\u00a0 as paragraphs 13 and 15 of ordinance No. 3, illegal, null and void; and\u00a0 directs the\u00a0 municipal\u00a0 council of Cebu to immediately issue the permit requested\u00a0 by the\u00a0 plaintiff\u00a0 on April 18, 1910, for\u00a0 the construction of the building projected in the plan approved by the Government architect, oft lots 3 and 4 of block 2 of the Cebu water-front reclamation No. 2,\u00a0 the temporary injunction\u00a0 issued by this\u00a0 court on April 29, 1910, becoming permanent, that is, perpetually forbidding the municipality of Cebu and all of\u00a0 its officers, representatives, agents, employees, attorneys and other persons in its\u00a0 service to prohibit or\u00a0 attempt\u00a0 to\u00a0 prohibit,\u00a0 to suspend or attempt\u00a0 to suspend, to hinder or to attempt to hinder, directly or indirectly, by means of force or threats, complaint or charge against the plaintiff, his\u00a0 agents, employees, attorneys or contractors,\u00a0 in any manner, the construction work on the building projected upon lots 3 and 4 of block 2 of the official plan of Cebu water-front reclamation No. 2, as long as the plaintiff continues such construction in accordance with the plan approved\u00a0 by the Insular Architect on March\u00a0 26,\u00a0 1910, or any other\u00a0 plan that\u00a0 does not violate\u00a0 ordinances\u00a0 or reasonable\u00a0 regulations\u00a0 for the health and public security of the municipality of Cebu;\u00a0 with all the costs of this judgment against said municipality.\" Defendant appealed from this judgment,\u00a0 alleging as the ground thereof that\u00a0 the court\u00a0 erred in annulling ordinance No. 100 and\u00a0 sections 13 and 15 of ordinance No. 3 enacted and published by the municipal council of Cebu. <\/p><\/blockquote><p>Ordinance No. 100 must be immediately dismissed from consideration, because, as the trial judge well says, since it was suspended by the provincial board and therefore not in force it can not be invoked as the ground for refusing the permit requested by\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiff.\u00a0\u00a0 Aside from this, what is said in the foregoing decision\u00a0 regarding sections 13 and\u00a0 15 of ordinance No. 3 may be considered applicable.

it\u00a0 will be\u00a0 8 1\/2 meters in height to the highest point of the roof and will be of one story with a height of 5 meters and 20 centimeters to the ceiling, and will be a strong, fireproof structure.\u00a0 We have not before us the plan of this building, but it is stated in the judgment appealed from, without any objection on the appellant's part, \"that it fulfills all the conditions reasonably necessary for safeguarding the public health, as\u00a0 well as for protection against fire and other dangers and calamities, said building to be of fireproof materials\u00a0 with\u00a0 good ventilating facilities;\" and it is\u00a0 also\u00a0 stated in the same judgment that the land\u00a0 whereon\u00a0 the plaintiff proposes to erect it \"is situated on the water front of the municipality of Cebu,\u00a0 where all the\u00a0 steamers of said port load\u00a0 and discharge.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Appellant\u00a0 contends that the municipality\u00a0 of Cebu has authority to require that the building in question\u00a0 be of more than one\u00a0 story and fulfill the conditions prescribed in the afore-cited\u00a0 sections of ordinance No. 3, by virtue of section 39 of the Municipal Code,\u00a0 which provides the following :<\/p><blockquote><p>\"The municipal council\u00a0 shall:<\/p><\/blockquote><p align=\"center\">*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<\/p><blockquote><p>\"(<em>f<\/em>)\u00a0 Establish fire limits, prescribe the kind of buildings that may be constructed within said limits and issue permits for the erection of the\u00a0 same,\u00a0 but\u00a0 without\u00a0 charging\u00a0 fees for said permits.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Appellant contends that the expression<em> kind of buildings,<\/em> employed in\u00a0 the legal provision just quoted, includes not only the material of which they are to be composed but also the style; that is\u00a0 (so he concludes), that it empowers the municipalities to prescribe by means\u00a0 of an ordinance the material that may be used in\u00a0 a building constructed within the fire\u00a0 limits, and the style, whether it shall be &amp; warehouse\u00a0 or a dwelling house, and if the latter, whether it shall have one,\u00a0 two,\u00a0 or three\u00a0 stories,\u00a0 as\u00a0 all this\u00a0 may enter into\u00a0 the expression <em>kind of\u00a0 buildings<\/em>, employed in subsection (<em>f<\/em>) of section 39 of the Municipal Code.<\/p><p>Without trying\u00a0 to settle\u00a0 the question\u00a0 in\u00a0 the concrete manner in which appellant's counsel asserts it, in the belief that it is unnecessary for the purposes of this decision, and admitting for the\u00a0 sake of argument that the\u00a0 legal provision cited really has the scope and meaning said counsel attributes to it, it is\u00a0 certain that such provision does not authorize the municipal council in a special and specific manner to direct that the buildings necessarily have more than one story or a special and prescribed style of architecture or ornamentation.\u00a0\u00a0 If such authority really exists, it would be merely from the inference that it\u00a0 is included by implication\u00a0 in the general authority granted to\u00a0 the councils by the\u00a0 law for fixing the kind\u00a0 of buildings that should or may be permitted within their respective jurisdictions.\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore,\u00a0 it\u00a0 is not\u00a0 so\u00a0 clearly and evidently beyond all argument that the law does not confer upon municipal councils the specific and definite power mooted in this case.\u00a0\u00a0 What does appear to be unquestionable, and this is our point of view,\u00a0 is that the law does\u00a0 not in any way\u00a0 prescribe the form\u00a0 in\u00a0 which such\u00a0 power should\u00a0 be exercised, supposing it to exist, for the terms are so general and abstract\u00a0 that they contain\u00a0 no detailed provision regarding the manner of exercising the alleged power\u00a0 in question.\u00a0 This\u00a0 being so, the exercise of this power must be subjected\u00a0 to\u00a0 the\u00a0 requirements\u00a0 of\u00a0 reason\u00a0 and\u00a0 public expediency, requirements that,\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 absence\u00a0 of definite provisions\u00a0 of law,\u00a0 must\u00a0 serve as\u00a0 a guide.\u00a0 It would\u00a0 be absurd to\u00a0 suppose that the\u00a0 municipalities may exercise such power in all ways without\u00a0 any restriction.\u00a0 Without regulations controlling its exercise, the most vexatious arbitrariness would\u00a0 be easily attained.\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of definite legal provisions, these regulations can not be other than those\u00a0 dictated by reason and public expediency.<\/p><p>In the present case, which deals with a\u00a0 building intended for warehouses and storerooms in a\u00a0 place especially\u00a0 given over to loading\u00a0 and discharging the steamers that call at the port of\u00a0 Cebu, we do not regard it at all reasonable to require that such building have more than one\u00a0 story\u00a0 or display a special and prescribed style of\u00a0 ornamentation. Moreover, the commercial interests or purposes which should unquestionably prevail in the location mentioned do not, in our opinion, require such a thing, nor would they\u00a0 probably secure greater benefit therefrom.\u00a0\u00a0 Keeping in mind also that the building mentioned fulfills the conditions reasonably necessary\u00a0 for security, healthfulness, and\u00a0 hygiene, as stated in the judgment appealed from, we\u00a0 believe that the municipal council of Cebu,\u00a0 in the case before us, for it is not our intention to lay down a general\u00a0 rule for all cases, has no right to oppose or to prohibit the construction of said building, and therefore the judgment appealed from must on this definite ground be affirmed in its principal part.<\/p><p>As the defendant must, in accordance with this judgment, issue the permit requested by the plaintiff,\u00a0 the permanent injunction therein ordered ceases thereby to have any justification, and should be eliminated therefrom.\u00a0\u00a0 The temporary\u00a0 injunction issued\u00a0 by\u00a0 the court\u00a0 on April 30, 1910, is also dissolved.<\/p><p>With\u00a0 this modification the judgment appealed\u00a0 from\u00a0 is affirmed in\u00a0 so far as it orders the municipal council of the municipality of Cebu to\u00a0 issue the permit requested by the plaintiff, which\u00a0 gave rise to this\u00a0 suit; with the\u00a0 costs of this instance against the\u00a0 appellant\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<\/p><p><em>Arellano, C.\u00a0 J.,\u00a0 Johnson, Carson<\/em>, and\u00a0 <em>Moreland,\u00a0 JJ.<\/em>, concur.<\/p><\/div>",

that\u00a0 for a long\u00a0 time\u00a0 past he had been in\u00a0 uninterrupted possession of\u00a0 the said lot and had been paying the taxes thereon; but that, on October 14, 1908,\u00a0 the aforesaid sheriff\u00a0 Andrada, at the request of Jorge Pardo, proceeded to attach the lot in question, without the plaintiff being previously notified\u00a0 thereof,\u00a0 for the purpose of selling\u00a0 the\u00a0 same at public auction as\u00a0 belonging to Alvaro\u00a0 Alcantara, under authority of a writ\u00a0 of\u00a0 execution issued by the court in favor of the said Pardo and against Alcantara in a case instituted to enforce the payment of P697.50 together with\u00a0 the legal interest thereon, while in the said writ the property of the judgment debtor Alcantara, which was to be attached, was not specified; that the plaintiff, by\u00a0 a\u00a0 written petition presented to the sheriff, asked him to release the attached lot, for the reason that it did not belong to\u00a0 Alcantara, and\u00a0 stated to him under oath that he owned and possessed the\u00a0 said\u00a0 lot, and set forth the grounds in support of his\u00a0 ownership; but that the defendant\u00a0 Pardo opposed\u00a0 his claim and insisted\u00a0 on the maintenance\u00a0 of the attachment, made at his\u00a0 instance, and that\u00a0 the sale at public\u00a0 auction\u00a0 should be proceeded with,\u00a0 for which purpose he furnished a bond in the sum of P2,000; that, therefore, the defendant sheriff, maintaining: the attachment, proceeded\u00a0 with the sale of the said lot at public auction, as belonging to Alcantara, on the 28th of November, 1908; that it was sold for only F824, when it was worth at least P1,200, at which latter amount more than two persons had offered to buy it, although the plaintiff did not wish to sell it, as he intended to erect thereon a building of strong material; that the said lot was then producing an annual rent of P75, as he had leased it\u00a0 to some Chinamen who were occupying it; and\u00a0 that, as\u00a0 a result of the said attachment and execution sale made at the request of the defendant Pardo, he suffered loss and damage in the amount of P800.\u00a0 The complaint concluded by asking that judgment be rendered in the plaintiff's favor and against the defendants, by ordering the return of the\u00a0 said lot to him, together with reimbursement of the\u00a0 rents he failed to collect, in addition to an indemnity for loss and damage, and the costs of the trial.\u00a0\u00a0 The plaintiff, by motion, prayed to be allowed to amend the petitionary part of his complaint, in the following terms: \"Therefore he prays that judgment be rendered in his behalf against the defendants, by awarding him an indemnity for the value of his said lot already sold and for other loss and damage suffered, and the costs of the trial; and that the\u00a0 title of the action be amended thus: 'For an indemnity for the value of a lot sold and for other loss and damage.' \"<\/p><p>The sheriff, Isaac Andrada, in his written answer, stated that he admitted the\u00a0 fact that the attachment of the land claimed had been made,\u00a0 pursuant to the\u00a0 provisions of the law, but denied all the allegations relative to the ownership and\u00a0 possession of\u00a0 Tomas Amancio to the land\u00a0 sold under execution of judgment and\u00a0 described in the complaint.<\/p><p>The other defendant, Jorge Pardo, in his amended answer, stated that he denied each and all of the paragraphs contained in the complaint, and, as a special defense, alleged that the attached lot\u00a0 did not belong to the\u00a0 plaintiff Tomas Amancio at the time\u00a0 the attachment was made, but to Alvaro Alcantara.<\/p><p>The case having come up for trial, and after evidence had been furnished by both parties, the court, on October 4, 1909,\u00a0 rendered judgment disallowing the said\u00a0 complaint and holding that the plaintiff was not entitled to the remedy solicited by him against the defendants Pardo and Andrada, and assessed the costs against\u00a0 the plaintiff.\u00a0 Counsel for the latter excepted\u00a0 to this judgment and asked for the annulment of the same and\u00a0 a rehearing, which motion was overruled\u00a0 and\u00a0 an\u00a0 exception\u00a0 was taken\u00a0 thereto\u00a0 by the plaintiff\u00a0 and appellant; the proper bill\u00a0 of exceptions having been filed, it was admitted,\u00a0 certified and forwarded to the clerk of\u00a0 this court.<\/p><p>It is to be noted that the document, Exhibit C, rejected by the lower court, was likewise forwarded,\u00a0 but that the same was not done with\u00a0 respect to the document Exhibit 1\u00a0 of the appellee, for the reason that the latter failed to secure its separation from Civil Case\u00a0 No. 66, where it is on file, and did\u00a0 not pay the required fees for the certified copy thereof, which must\u00a0 have remained among the papers of the said case\u00a0 (p. 2\u00a0 of the record).<\/p><p>Reduced to its bare terms, the issue\u00a0 raised in this litigation, through the pending appeal, is to be resolved by deciding definitely who was the real\u00a0 owner of the disputed lot, on October 14, 1908,\u00a0 whether it was the plaintiff, Tomas Amancio, or his son-in-law, Alvaro Alcantara, the judgment debtor of the defendant Jorge Pardo.<\/p><p>At the instance of this creditor, who obtained a judgment and then a writ of execution against his debtor, Alcantara, for the\u00a0 collection of\u00a0 his claim\u00a0 of P697.50, together with legal interest, the lot\u00a0 in litigation was attached and afterwards sold at public auction to Federico Habana for P824, a bond having been given by the said creditor to cover any possible\u00a0 liability that might be incurred by the sheriff, in view of the plaintiff Amancio's claim that he was the owner of the property.<\/p><p>The original owner of\u00a0 the\u00a0 lot\u00a0 was\u00a0 Estanislao Alvarez who, on\u00a0 November 29,\u00a0 1889, sold it, by a notarial\u00a0 instrument, to Ramon Amancio for the sum of 400 pesos (Exhibit B), and the latter,\u00a0 in turn, sold it to his father, Tomas Amancio, for 1,000 pesos, according to a private instrument executed on December 2, 1898, Exhibit A.<\/p><p>These two instruments were presented by the plaintiff to prove that he was the owner and proprietor of the aforesaid lot; he also exhibited five receipts proving that he had collected rents paid\u00a0 by two Chinamen who, as tenants, occupied portions of the lot in question.<\/p><p>For the purpose of proving that, on the date of the attachment, the attached lot did not belong to the plaintiff, but to Alvaro Alcantara, as alleged\u00a0 in the answer to the complaint, the defendant presented\u00a0 the will executed by the defendant Tomas Amancio on November 3,1898, before the notary\u00a0 public Jose Maria Garcia.\u00a0 This will is\u00a0 attached to the record, No. 66, of\u00a0 the probate proceedings had\u00a0 in the Court of First Instance of\u00a0 Capiz, in re the estate\u00a0 of the deceased Manuela Amancio, who was a daughter of the plaintiff and the wife of the defendant.<\/p><p>The will\u00a0 herein referred\u00a0 to\u00a0 must have been\u00a0 executed pursuant to the provisions of the Civil Code, article 694\u00a0 of which prescribes:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"An open will shall be executed before a notary, qualified to act at the place of its\u00a0 execution, and three competent witnesses who can see and understand the testator and\u00a0 of whom one, at least must know how and be able to write.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>On the hypothesis that the said will was\u00a0 executed\u00a0 in conformity with this article, it is unquestionable that it is vested with the character of a\u00a0 public document,\u00a0 like any instrument authenticated by a notary public, and is therefore proof, even against third parties,\u00a0 of the facts which were\u00a0 the cause of its execution and of the date when\u00a0 it was executed, for\u00a0 the reason that it is a document authenticated\u00a0 by a public official of this character,\u00a0 pursuant\u00a0 to the provisions of articles 1216, 1217 and 1218 of the Civil Code.<\/p><p>In\u00a0 the judgment\u00a0 appealed from there appear several clauses of the aforementioned will, which are:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"On\u00a0 folio 125 of the said public instrument the following is to be found: 'He certifies that with the consent of his aforesaid wife he has bequeathed to his said children the following\u00a0 properties\u00a0 and\u00a0 effects:\u00a0 To\u00a0 Ramon\u00a0 Amancio *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 six hundred pesos, three-fifths of the one thousand pesos which is the.value of\u00a0 a lot owned by the testator, situated on called Rivera of this provincial seat and containing lumber, stone and sand, which lot was sold by him to his brother-in-law, Don Alvaro Alcantara y Ardeiia, for the said sum of one thousand pesos\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 P600.'<\/p><p>\"Further on, folio 130, is found: 'To\u00a0 Rosario\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 * two hundred pesos, a fifth part of $he one thousand pesos, the value of a lot containing lumber, stone and sand situated on calle Rivera,\u00a0 of this town and which was sold to D. Alvaro\u00a0 Alcantara de Santos y Ardeiia for the said sum of one thousand pesos\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 * P200.'<\/p><p>\"And, finally, on folios 130 and l31 there is the following: \"To Concepcion\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 two hundred pesos, a fifth\u00a0 part of the\u00a0 one\u00a0 thousand\u00a0 pesos, the value of a lot containing lumber, stone and sand, situated on Calle Rivera of\u00a0 this town and which was sold to D. Alvaro Alcantara de Santos y Ardena for the said sum of one thousand pesos\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 * P200.'\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The record in the present case\u00a0 shows it to have been duly proven that the lot in question is the same one referred to in the will executed\u00a0 before a notary by the plaintiff Tomas Amaneio who declares therein that his son, Ramon Amancio, had sold the said lot to the latter's brother-in-law, Alvaro Alcantara, for the sum of\u00a0 1,000 pesos; therefore, the testator being no longer able to dispose of the said lot, as it was no longer his, directed in his aforementioned will that the amount derived from the sale of the lot to his son-in-law Alcantara should be distributed\u00a0 in the manner detailed in the preinserted clauses of his will.<\/p><p>This document exhibited at the trial was not impugned, nor assailed as false; therefore, being a public instrument executed with the formalities required by law, it is efficacious, produces all the effects that flow from a valid instrument and constitutes, in so far as it concerns the lot and its value, a true admission or statement\u00a0 against the testator's own interests.\u00a0 Such a voluntary statement of his, made in his will, is entirely incompatible with his present claim that he is still the owner of the land already sold to Alcantara.\u00a0 As a result of all this, it is evident that the plaintiff's testator comes within\u00a0 the rules of estoppel referred to in section 333 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions.\u00a0 (Alconaba <em>vs.<\/em> Abinez, 11 Phil. Rep., 152.)<\/p><p>In the syllabus of the decision of this court, Gomez Medel <em> vs.<\/em> Avecilla, 15 Phil. Rep., 465, the following doctrine was established:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"1. <em>Open wills under the old law.<\/em> - An open will, executed before a\u00a0 notary public\u00a0 with the requisite number of witnesses, was a public instrument having the force and effect of this class of public\u00a0 documents under the old law.<\/p><p>\"2. <em>Id.; Acknowledgment of a debt in a defective will<\/em>. - The acknowledgment of a debt, in such a will, by the testator in favor of another person, although the document may be insufficient as a will\u00a0 because of the lack\u00a0 of\u00a0 some legal formality required to give it validity, is nevertheless sufficient as Written and authentic evidence of the existence of the obligation.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Although the suit and the decision just above alluded to concerned the collection\u00a0 of a debt, nevertheless the\u00a0 first two paragraphs of the\u00a0 syllabus\u00a0 are\u00a0 cited with\u00a0 respect to the force and effect of a will as written evidence of\u00a0 the existence\u00a0 of an obligation, the fulfillment of\u00a0 which is independent of the date of the death of the testator.<\/p><p>The plaintiff avers that, as the purchaser had not completely paid\u00a0 the price\u00a0 of the\u00a0 said lot, the\u00a0 property was reacquired by him; but this allegation was not proven, nor was any document presented as proof of such alleged resale which, in any event, should have been made\u00a0 in favor\u00a0 of Ramon Amancio.<\/p><p>The said lot does, indeed,\u00a0 appear as having\u00a0 been\u00a0 sold on\u00a0 December 2, 1898,\u00a0 by Ramon Amancio\u00a0 to his father, the plaintiff, for the sum of one thousand pesos, according to Exhibit A, as aforestated;\u00a0 but this document, of a private character, can not prevail against a previous public instrument to the prejudice of a third person who did not intervene in its making and execution,\u00a0 nor in\u00a0 the\u00a0 obligation therein concerned.<\/p><p>It being a certain and positive fact that Ramon Amancio did sell the lot in question\u00a0 to\u00a0 his\u00a0 brother-in-law,\u00a0 Alvaro Alcantara, according to a statement made by the plaintiff, Tomas\u00a0 Amancio,\u00a0 in a notarial\u00a0 instrument executed on November 3,\u00a0 1898, and as it\u00a0 was\u00a0 not\u00a0 reacquired\u00a0 by the said Ramon Amancio from the purchaser Alcantara,\u00a0 it is impossible to\u00a0 conceive\u00a0 that the former\u00a0 could legally have sold it\u00a0 to the plaintiff\u00a0 on the\u00a0 2d of the following\u00a0 month of\u00a0 December,\u00a0 because he was no\u00a0 longer the owner of the property nor could he,\u00a0 on the date just mentioned, dispose of\u00a0 it,\u00a0\u00a0 since Alvaro Alcantara was\u00a0 the\u00a0 real\u00a0 proprietor thereof.<\/p><p>The private\u00a0 document, Exhibit\u00a0 A, can not establish the equity of a right\u00a0 of intervention\u00a0 of a third person in the ownership of real property attached for the payment\u00a0 of a debt contracted by its owner, because this would be to permit the employment, in suits of all kinds, of means tending to\u00a0 render illusory a final judgment which\u00a0 sanctioned\u00a0 the fulfillment of an obligation protected by the law.<\/p><p>It is\u00a0 an established legal doctrine,\u00a0 constantly\u00a0 maintained in practice by the\u00a0 courts\u00a0 of justice, that he\u00a0 who alleges\u00a0 a right of intervention based\u00a0 on ownership, must prove that he is the owner of the thing claimed; and if the claimant has not fulfilled this requisite,\u00a0 as\u00a0 determined by the trial judge, according\u00a0 to the\u00a0 weight given\u00a0 by him to the evidence, such judicial opinion must be respected.<\/p><p>The plaintiff, as has been shown, did not prove his ownership of\u00a0 the disputed lot and, therefore, the defendant had a perfect right to ask for\u00a0 and obtain the attachment and sale of\u00a0 the lot, which\u00a0 belonged exclusively\u00a0 to\u00a0 his\u00a0 debtor Alvaro Alcantara, for the collection\u00a0 of his claim; and the sheriff,\u00a0 in fulfilling the executory judgment rendered in behalf of\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant creditor, proceeded in compliance with the law.<\/p><p>For the foregoing reasons, whereby the errors attributed to the judgment appealed from, held to have been rendered in accordance with the\u00a0 law, are deemed\u00a0 to have\u00a0 been refuted, it is proper, in our opinion, to affirm and we hereby affirm the judgment and absolve the\u00a0 defendants from the complaint, with the costs against the appellant.<\/p><p><em> Mapa, Johnson, Carson, <\/em>and <em>Moreland, JJ<\/em>., concur.<\/p><\/div>",

This is the only question before us.<br\/><br\/>The appellants in this case\u00a0 base their appeal upon two grounds: First, that in view of the provisions of. section 5 of the Act of July 1,1902, and section 63 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the trial court\u00a0 had no power,\u00a0 authority, or jurisdiction to admit the accused Alvarez to bail, inasmuch as he was charged with a capital offense; that the admission to bail having been without jurisdiction, the bond was void. Second,\u00a0 that inasmuch as\u00a0 it was clearly proved that the accused\u00a0 had been killed prior to judgment on the bond, the sureties were discharged.<br\/><br\/>Paragraph 4 of section 5 of the Act of July 1, 1902, reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"That all\u00a0 persons\u00a0 shall before conviction be bailable by sufficient sureties, except for capital offenses.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Section 63 of the\u00a0 Code of Criminal Procedure reads\u00a0 as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"All prisoners shall be bailable before conviction, except those charged with the commission of capital offenses when proof of guilt\u00a0 is evident or the presumption of guilt\u00a0 is strong.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>From these provisions it is clear that even capital offenses are bailable in the discretion of the court before conviction. As a result, the objection of the appellants that the trial court had no power or jurisdiction to\u00a0 admit to\u00a0 bail in the case at bar, must be\u00a0 overruled.\u00a0\u00a0 Under the facts presented in this case the trial court may have exercised bad judgment in admitting to bail; but he had jurisdiction in the premises. That is the important thing here.<br\/><br\/>As to the second contention\u00a0 of the\u00a0 appellants, that the sureties were discharged by the death\u00a0 of the principal, the wording of section 76\u00a0 of the Code of Criminal Procedure should be noted.\u00a0 It reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"If without sufficient cause the defendant neglects to appear for arraignment, trial or judgment,\u00a0 or neglects to appear on any\u00a0 other occasion when his presence may be required in court, or fails to surrender\u00a0 himself in execution of the judgment, the court must direct the fact of his neglect or failure to be entered\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 records of the cause, and declare the undertaking or deposit,\u00a0 as\u00a0 the\u00a0 case may be, to be forfeited.\u00a0\u00a0 But if\u00a0 at any\u00a0 time within thirty days thereafter the defendant or his counsel appears and satisfactorily explains\u00a0 the neglect\u00a0 or failure,\u00a0 the\u00a0 court\u00a0 may\u00a0 direct the forfeiture to be discharged upon such terms as it may consider just.\u00a0 If the forfeiture is\u00a0 not so discharged, the1 pro- motor fiscal shall at once proceed by action\u00a0 against the bail upon their undertaking.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>We believe that the wording\u00a0 of this section, interpreted and construed under the conditions existing in these Islands, is conclusive against the appellants in this case.\u00a0\u00a0 We do not forget those decisions\u00a0 in\u00a0 which\u00a0 it has been held that the death of the principal in any recognizance, after forfeiture thereof,\u00a0 but before judgment\u00a0 rendered\u00a0 thereon, may be pleaded by the sureties in discharge of such recognizance. (State <i>vs. <\/i> Traphagen,\u00a0 45\u00a0 N. J. L.,\u00a0 134;\u00a0 Woolfolk <i>vs<\/i>. The State, 10 Ind., 532; Mather <i>vs.<\/i> The People,\u00a0 12\u00a0 I11., 9; Mix <i>vs<\/i>. The People, 26 I11., 481; People <i>vs<\/i>. Watkins, 19 I11., 117.) These decisions, however,\u00a0 were, generally speaking, based upon the wording of particular statutes.\u00a0\u00a0 Under the form of the statute which we are construing, and in view of\u00a0 the mischief which it seeks to prevent,\u00a0 we are\u00a0 of\u00a0 the opinion that the judgment of the\u00a0 court below should be affirmed. We would\u00a0 offer no objection, however, if the\u00a0 Legislature should see fit by special enactment, or otherwise, to relieve the\u00a0 sureties of their obligation,\u00a0 in view of the fact that\u00a0 the accused\u00a0 whose\u00a0 appearance they assured was killed shortly after judgment was obtained upon the bond.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from\u00a0 is affirmed, with costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Isidro Paredes presiding, convicting the appellants of murder and sentencing each of them to <i>cadena perpetua<\/i>, with the corresponding accessories, to the payment of\u00a0 an indemnity of P500 and the costs of the trial.\u00a0 The accused, Juan Oracion, died pending the appeal.<br\/><br\/>It appears from the evidence in this case that on or about the 13th day of January, 1910, an old man by the name of Juan Tamudong was riding on\u00a0 his <i>banquilla <\/i>on a river in the municipality of Dagupan, in the Province of Pangasinan, when he\u00a0 was met\u00a0 by the two accused in this\u00a0 case, Juan Oracion and Nicolas Lambino, riding in another <i>banquilla,<\/i> who invited him to enter their <i>banquilla<\/i> and go with them. He accepted their invitation and they immediately started across the river to a place where Carlos Moyano kept a house for\u00a0 the sale\u00a0 of <i>tuba. <\/i> Arriving there they met not only Carlos\u00a0 Moyano\u00a0 but also Victoriano Jaramillo (<i>alias<\/i> Atong).\u00a0\u00a0 The accused invited Jaramillo to go with them, stating that they would find better\u00a0 tuba in another place. In\u00a0 response to their request, Jaramillo embarked with the other three in the same <i>banquilla,<\/i> and the four proceeded to a locality known as Aliuecuec.\u00a0 Arriving there, the four disembarked and started into the nipa forest which covered all\u00a0 of the locality thereabouts.\u00a0 Arriving in an out-of-the-way place, where they were entirely free from observation and discovery, each one\u00a0 of the accused suddenly seized an arm of Jaramillo,\u00a0 holding\u00a0 him\u00a0 tightly so\u00a0 that he could neither escape nor move effectively.\u00a0\u00a0 In this condition Nicolas\u00a0 Lambino drew\u00a0 his bolo and struck Jaramillo three blows, which, in addition to causing\u00a0 other wounds, severed his head from his body.\u00a0 Thereupon the accused took the corpse and carried it to another place a little distance away and left it lying on the ground.\u00a0 They then quitted the place in the same manner in which they had come to it.<br\/><br\/>These facts were given in the testimony of Juan Tamudong, the only witness, aside\u00a0 from the accused themselves, who saw the\u00a0 commission of the crime.\u00a0\u00a0 His testimony is strongly corroborated\u00a0 (a)\u00a0 by the testimony of Carlos Moyano, who,\u00a0 as a witness, stated that he saw\u00a0 the accused arrive there at his tuba-house in a banquilla with the witness Tamudong; that they found there the deceased Jaramillo; that they talked with him and invited him to go with them; that each one\u00a0 of them carried a bolo;\u00a0 (b) by the\u00a0 fact that the corpse of\u00a0 Jaramillo was found in the exact place indicated\u00a0 by\u00a0 the witness\u00a0 Tamudong, and\u00a0 that the wounds inflicted upon the body\u00a0 of the deceased were substantially as described by the witness; (c) by the fact of the identification of the body and the declaration of the wife of the deceased, who, testifying as a witness,\u00a0 stated that her husband left the house in the morning of the day in question, saying that he must go to the tuba store kept by Carlos Moyano, and that she had not since seen him alive.<br\/><br\/>The defense of the accused\u00a0 was an\u00a0 alibi.\u00a0\u00a0 Upon\u00a0 this branch\u00a0 of the case\u00a0 the learned trial court says:<br\/><blockquote>\"The\u00a0 accused attempted to establish an alibi, but such alibi can not be admitted for the reason that not one of the witnesses of the accused told the truth.\u00a0 It is absurd to assert that there were typhoons and storms in\u00a0 any part of the municipality of Dagupan\u00a0 on the 13th day of January of this year.\u00a0 It is a\u00a0 greater\u00a0 absurdity for the accused to say that they\u00a0 did not know of any place called Aliuecuec, when\u00a0 this place, according to the proofs, is within the limits of the barrio of Anolid, of which barrio\u00a0 the accused, Juan Oracion, had been teniente\u00a0 concejal for\u00a0 four years.\u00a0 It is easy to instruct witnesses to testify alike, but the credibility of such\u00a0 witnesses does not depend upon their number or the coincidence of\u00a0 their statements.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>A careful reading of the evidence leads us to the belief that the learned trial court properly weighed the\u00a0 evidence in regard to the alleged defense.\u00a0 Two witnesses whose credibility has not been impeached testified clearly and positively, the one that he saw the deceased go away with the accused in the direction of the place where his dead body was subsequently found,\u00a0 and\u00a0 saw them return\u00a0 without him;\u00a0 the other, that he actually saw the accused commit the murder. The testimony of the accused and their\u00a0 witnesses, tending to show that\u00a0 they were at a different place\u00a0 during all the hours of\u00a0 the day\u00a0 on\u00a0 which\u00a0 the crime\u00a0 was\u00a0 committed, produced a conflict in the testimony which had to be resolved by the trial court.\u00a0\u00a0 He saw the witnesses\u00a0 in\u00a0 the act of testifying,\u00a0 carefully observed their manner and\u00a0 attitude; he\u00a0 weighed their testimony\u00a0 together with all\u00a0 the circumstances of\u00a0 the case and arrived at the conclusion that the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution was entitled to credit.\u00a0\u00a0 We find nothing in the record\u00a0 or in the facts and circumstances which go to make up the history of this case from which we can\u00a0 say that the conclusion of the learned trial court\u00a0 was wrong.\u00a0 If there were reason to do so, we would not hesitate a moment\u00a0 in so declaring.\u00a0 On the\u00a0 other hand, when there is absolutely\u00a0 nothing to\u00a0 indicate such error, we must just as strongly insist that we will not inter- fere with the conclusion reached.<br\/><br\/>The learned trial court qualified the\u00a0 crime\u00a0 as murder, using <i>alevosia<\/i> for that purpose.\u00a0\u00a0 We are of\u00a0 the opinion that he was right.\u00a0\u00a0 (U.

Don Jose Camps, <em>comisario de guerra honorario, oficial mayor jubilado <\/em>of the office of the secretary of his superior government, and director of the ironworking and nautical instrument establishment of <em>Camps e Hijos<\/em>, is granted the possession and ownership of a parcel of land 200 brazas in length and 100 brazas in width, covered at present by the waters of the sea, near the Binondo beach, which land is situated alongside the Murallon del Norte, and requested authority to fill in the same at his expense is also hereby granted, subject to the following conditions and restrictions:<\/p><p>\"First. The land to be filled in shall form a cuadrangle 200 brazas long and 100 brazas wide; beginning on the longer side, nearest to the Pasig River, at a point 25 varas from the bridge connecting the waters of the river and of the bay, and running parallel with the wharf toward the lighthouse.<\/p><p>\"Second. The buildings to be erected by Camps on this new land so granted shall be located along the said longer side, parallel to the breakwater, separated from the edge of the exterior wharf for its whole length, a distance of 16\u00bd varas, which is the width required for wharves.<\/p><p>\"Third. The said buildings shall consist of only one story, no materials of the kind prohibited in the military zone shall be employed therein, and shall be roofed with zinc, tarred paper, nipa, or other similar materials.<\/p><p>\"Fourth. The said buildings shall be removed at the expense of Don Jose Camps or his successors whenever, at the discretion of the superior authority of the Islands, the military service so requires.<\/p><p>\"Let the interested party be notified and a certified copy be issued to him.<br\/><br\/><\/p><\/blockquote><div align=\"right\">(Sgd.) \"NORZAGARAY.\"<br\/><br\/><\/div><p>Opposition to the registration was made by the Insular Government and the City of Manila upon the ground that the grant was unauthorized, because the land was a part of the shore of the sea. The court of land registration pronounced the grant valid, sustained the petitioner's asserted ownership of all existing title under it, construed it as made upon condition that the land be reclaimed from the sea, found that the condition had been fulfilled as to part of the land only, and entered a judgment allowing registration of that part, and refusing registration of the remainder. Appeals to the Supreme Court of the Philippines resulted in an affirmance of the judgment by an opinion saying:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"Although we are unable to agree upon the grounds upon which our conclusion is based, we are of opinion that the judgment of the court of land registration should be affirmed, without costs to either party.\" (10 Philippine, 522.)<\/p><\/blockquote><p>One member of the court (Johnson, J.) dissented because he was of opinion that the grant was not made upon condition that the land be reclaimed, and another member (Tracey, J.) dissented because he was of opinion that the grant, being of land covered by tidal waters, was one which only the King of Spain could make. Each of the parties has appealed to this court and has also sued out a writ of error.<\/p><p>In addition to the authenticity of the grant and the petitioner's ownership of all existing title under it, neither of which was questioned, the facts disclosed by the record are these: At the date of the grant the land was marshy waste land, which was covered by the sea at high tide and was uncovered at low tide. Soon after the grant was made, the grantee marked its boundaries and began filling in the land. In the course of twenty years, about one third of the tract was reclaimed and was then improved by erecting warehouses and other buildings thereon. At irregular intervals further work was done toward filling in the remainder, but the area fully reclaimed was not materially enlarged. The grantee and those claiming under him were in the exclusive occupancy and use of the land reclaimed from the time the work was done, and at all times asserted title to the entire tract, and intended to complete its reclamation. What was done by them in filling in and improving the land was done openly and at large expense, and neither their work nor their occupancy was at any time disturbed, although both were at all times well known to those in authority at Manila. Nor was the validity or extent of the grant in any wise called in question while the Philippines remained under the dominion of Spain, or until four years thereafter, which was forty-four years after the date of the grant. On the contrary, taxes were imposed upon the land as private property, and at the commencement of the proceeding for registration, the land and the improvements were assessed to the petitioner at a valuation of $255,578.<\/p><p>It is the contention of the Insular Government and the City of Manila that the grant was unauthorized and void, first, because the King of Spain was without power to make it, and so could not devolve that power upon the Governor-General, and second, because, even if the King possessed that power, he had not devolved it upon the governor general.<\/p><p>The first branch of the contention is rested, primarily, upon article 46 of the then Constitution of Spain, which declared that \"to alienate, cede, or exchange any part of Spanish territory,\" the King required \"the authority of a special law;\" and, secondarily, upon laws 3 and 4, title 28, Partida, 3, which affirm that the sea and its shore are among the things which belong in common to all men. Of the article in the Spanish Constitution it is enough to say that it obviously did not relate to the disposal of public land as property, but only to the transference of national sovereignty; and of the laws cited from Partida 3 it is enough to say that the same meaning and influence must be attributed to them now that were attributed to them by the Supreme Judicial Tribunal of Spain in its decision of May 1, 1863 (Book 8, p. 288), wherein, in sustaining a royal order of January 15, 1853, making a grant of tide land to one who desired to reclaim and improve it, it was said:<br\/><br\/><\/p><blockquote><p>\"While it is true that Partida 3, title 28, laws 3 and 4, in determining what things are the common right of men, and how they may use them, enumerates as such, among other things, the sea and its shores, this is not to be taken in an absolutely literal manner, since a number of limitations to the general proposition have been recognized for the common benefit of the community as being conducive to the general welfare of the state, which latter may grant shore land for improvement where the same has not already lawfully come under private ownership.<br\/><\/p><\/blockquote><p>As, then, the King possessed the power to make the grant, we come to the second branch of the contention; namely, that he had not devolved that power upon the Governor-General. Many royal orders bearing upon the subject have been called to our attention. The one of first importance is embodied in law 11, title 15, book 2, Laws of the Indies, and reads as follows:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"In the City of Manila, Island of Luzon, capital of the Philippines, another <em>audiencia<\/em> and royal chancery is established, with a president, <em>who shall be the governor and captain general; <\/em>four associate judges (<em>oidores<\/em>), who shall, also be criminal judges (<em>alcaldes del crimen<\/em>) ; one fiscal, one high constable, one vice grand chancellor (<em>teniente de gran chanceler<\/em>), and the other necessary ministers and officials; and the said<em> audiencia<\/em> shall have as its district the lands of the said Island of Luzon, already discovered and which may be discovered. And <em>we order that the governor and captain general <\/em>of the said islands and province, and president of the royal audiencia of the same, <em>hold exclusively the superior government of the whole district of said audiencia in peace and war, and made in our royal name those sentences and grant those favors which, in conformity with the laws of this compilation and of these kingdoms of Castile, and with the instructions and power received from us, he may and ought to make; and in all those administrative cases and matters of importance<\/em>, the said president governor shall try the same together with the<i> oidores of said audiencia <\/i>in order that they may give him their opinion in consultation, and after hearing the same, <em>he shall provide for what is best for the service of God and our own interests, and the peace and tranquility of the said province and community<\/em>.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Without doubt it was intended by this order to invest the Governor-General with large powers and a wide range.of discretion, fully commensurate with the situation in which they were to be exercised. The language used was general and comprehensive. Possibly, according to Spanish standards, its meaning was much the same as if it had been said directly that the Governor-General of the Philippines was empowered thereby to do in that distant province whatever the King could do, if he were present, save where it was otherwise specially provided. The other orders bearing upon the subject are not inconsistent with that view of it. But whatever the original meaning of the order may have been, the one suggested was adopted and adhered to by the successive governor-generals, and their action in that regard was acquiesced in, and therefore ratified, by the King. Thus, in the course of approved usage, the order came to be, in effect, the same as the one relating to the viceroys of Peru and New Spain, which is embodied in law 2, title 3, book 3, Laws of the Indies, and declares: \"They shall do what they may think and consider to be suitable, and provide for everything we might do and provide for, of whatever quality and condition it may be, in the provinces under their charge, as if the same were governed by ourselves, in all cases where no special prohibition exists.\"<\/p><p>Recognition of this is found in <em>Coronado's Legislation Ultramarina<\/em>, vol. 2, pp. 175, 176, where after stating that the powers of the governor-generals of the Philippines and other provinces beyond the seas include the powers named \"under the titles of viceroys and presidents in the Laws of the Indies,\" the author proceeds:<br\/><\/p><blockquote><p>\"This consolidation of such vastly important powers, although it has some inconveniences, has been deemed necessary in order to surround with prestige and sustain a superior authority at so great a distance from the sovereign, in the capitals of those large provinces, sufficiently to provide speedily and easily all requirements for their preservation and tranquility, for which the captains general are responsible, and to provide also a good policy and administration,, the Security of the persons and property of the inhabitants, the publication and due execution of the laws and orders emanating from the high government, and, generally, every wise and prudent measure demanded by the public order, the tranquility, and greater prosperity of the countries intrusted to them.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>And so it is that historical reviews of the Philippines, while under Spanish dominion, uniformly speak of the governor-generals as possessing almost absolute authority, as is illustrated by the following:<\/p><p>(See also <em>San Pedro's Legislation Ultramarina<\/em>, vol. 1, p. 65).<\/p><p>In the history by Juan Jose Delgado, chapter 17, pp. 212 et seq., which was written in 1754, it is said:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"In no kingdom or province of the Spanish Crown do the viceroys or governors enjoy greater privileges, superiority, and grandeur than in Filipinas. That is advisable because of the long distance from the court, and their proximity to so many kingdoms and nations, some of them civilized, but others barbaric. * * * The governors of these islands are almost absolute. * * * They exercise supreme authority by reason of their charge, for receiving and sending embassies to the neighboring Kings and tyrants, for sending them gifts and presents in the name of their King, and for accepting those which those Kings and tyrants send them. They can make and preserve peace, declare and make war, and take vengeance on all who insult us, without awaiting any resolution from court for it. * * * Besides the above, the governors of these islands have absolute authority privately to provide and attend to all that pertains to the royal estate.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>In Montero y Vidal's work, p. 162, published in 1866, this appears:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"A governor and captain general exercises the supreme authority in Filipinas. In his charge is the direction of all civil and military matters, and even the direction of ecclesiastical matters, in so far as they touch the royal patronage. * * * The authority then, of the governor-general, is complete.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>And in the Philippine census of 1903, vol. 1, p. 364, Trinidad H. Pardo de Tavera of the Philippine Commission states that \"the powers given to a governor of the Philippine Islands was practically unlimited.\"<\/p><p>Considering, then, that the governor-general, within the territory committed to his charge, possessed all the powers of his master, the King, save where it was otherwise specially provided, the questions whether the grant was within or in excess of the authority of the governor-general is to be determined, not by inquiring whether there was a law or order specially confiding to him the disposal of the tide land but by inquiring whether there was a law or order specially prohibiting such a disposal; that is to say, the existence of power, being usual, will be presumed, and the absence of it, being exceptional, must be shown. (United States <em>vs.<\/em> Arredondo, 6 Pet, 691, 728, 8 L. ed., 547, 561; United States <em>vs.<\/em> Clarke, 8 Pet., 436, 451; 8 L. ed., 1001, 1006.)<\/p><p>The laws and orders brought to our attention do not contain anything which, rightly considered, amounted to a prohibition of this grant. Laws 3 and 4, title 28, Partida, 3 which affirm that the sea and its shore are among the things which are common to all men, are the nearest in point, but they, as interpreted by the Supreme Judicial Tribunal of Spain, were not to be taken literally, and did not forbid the granting of tide land for purposes of reclamation and improvement.<\/p><p>What has been said sufficiently shows that the grant was made upon adequate authority, but there are other considerations which enforce this conclusion. The Spanish authorities at Manila, although familiar with what was done and claimed under the grant, and although in a position to know and enforce the law applicable to it, did not call it in question at any time during the thirty-nine years of Spanish dominion after it was made, but on the contrary, treated it as valid by imposing taxes upon the land as private property. This is persuasive proof that, in making the grant, the governor-general did not exceed his authority. Besides, it must be presumed, there being no showing to the contrary, that he reported the grant to his superiors at Madrid, as was required by the royal order of January 4, 1856 (San Pedro's Legislation Ultramarina, vol. 1, p. 75), and therefore the fact that the grant went unchallenged, as it did, dispels all doubt of his authority.<\/p><p>Next to be considered is the contention, advanced by the Insular Government and the City of Manila, that the grant was made upon condition that the land be reclaimed from the sea, and that \"all title thereunder is defeated,\" because part of the land has not as yet been reclaimed. The granting words, \"is granted the possession and ownership,\" are plain, and import a present and immediate transfer of the ownership of all the land. There are no words of exception, nor any which purport to postpone the transfer until a later time. And while it is clearly contemplated that the land is to be reclaimed, there is no language which fixes a time for beginning or completing that work. Nor is the contemplated reclamation treated as the sole inducement to the grant, for it recites that it is made in consideration, <em>inter alia<\/em>, of \"the official andindustrial merits of the said Don Jose Camps and the offer of protection stated\" in a prior decree. Thus, upon a survery of the grant, it is manifest that there was no express condition, either precedent or subsequent, that the land be reclaimed within any period of time. Of course, it was for the Governor-General to judge of the restrictions to be imposed. He could have designated a time within which the reclamation should be effected, and could have made compliance with that requirement a condition, either precedent or subsequent. Or, if to him it seemed wise, he could have left the grantee free to effect the reclamation at such time as to the latter might seem practicable and advantageous, considering the cost of the undertaking, the means at hand for completing it, and the benefits to be derived from it. But the Governor-General did not expressly adopt either of these alternatives. On the contrary, his will and purpose in that regard were expressed with such uncertainty that they could be determined only by resorting to interpretation. But that uncertainty was effectually eliminated before the termination of Spanish dominion in the Philippines. During the many intervening years the parties concerned, that is to say, the representatives of Spain and those claiming under the grant, pursued a course of action, heretofore described, which admits of no other conclusion that they concurred in treating the grant as embodying the latter of the two alternatives suggested. In that way a practical interpretation was given to the grant by those who were authorized to interpret it, and full effect must be given to that interpretation now.<\/p><p>It follows that the contention last stated must be rejected, and that the petitioner's contention that registration should have been allowed of the entire tract, including the part not as yet reclaimed, must be sustained.<\/p><p>The parties, being in doubt whether they should invoke our appellate jurisdiction in cases such as this by writ of error or by appeal, resorted to both methods. Since then it has been settled that the appropriate method is by writ of error. (Car\u00f1io <em>vs.<\/em> Philippine Islands, 212 U. S., 449, 456; 53 L. ed., 594, 595; 29 Sup. Ct.

INTERNATIONAL BANKING CORPORATION.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong><\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">These are two suits commenced in the court of first instance of the city of Manila on the same day, February 25, 1905, and numbered in that court as cases Nos. 3363, and 3365, respectively. In each suit the International Banking Company was plaintiff and Francisco Martinez and another person as the guardian of Martinez were defendants. After the present appeals were taken Martinez died and his administrator has been substituted in his stead.<p><\/p><p>We shall separately summarize the proceedings below in the two cases to the extent it is necessary to do so to understand the proper disposition to be made of the appeals.<\/p><p>Case No. 79 was a suit of an equitable nature brought by the bank against Martinez to foreclose a mortgage upon the steamer <em>Germana<\/em>, sell the steamer, and collect an alleged debt of 30,000 pesos, claimed to be secured thereby. By the answer and cross-bill it was asserted that, at the time of executing the mortgage, Martinez was mentally incapacitated and hence legally incompetent; that the whole transaction was void for fraud, duress, and conspiracy; that the alleged indebtedness was a part of the subject-matter of the instrument sued, on in the other case, the effect of which instrument was to supersede the mortgage sued on in this, and that plaintiff had wrongfully taken and held possession of the steamer and refused to account for its profits. As affirmative relief the setting aside of the whole transaction was demanded, as also the return of the steamer and an accounting of its profits.<\/p><p>The court of first instance in substance sustained these defenses, dismissed the plaintiff's suit, and directed a return of the steamer.<\/p><p>It was decided in the judgment: \"This case was tried together with case No. 3365, it being agreed that the evidence taken on the trial pertinent to either or both cases should be considered by the court in the respective cases.\" On appeal, the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands reversed this judgment, held that the transaction was valid, and entered the following judgment:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"It is ordered that the judgment appealed from the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, dated March 29, 1906, be, and the same is hereby, reversed, and the record remanded to the court from which it came, with directions to that court to enter judgment in favor of the plaintiff, and against the defendants, Francisco Martinez and his guardian, Vicente Ilustre, for the sum of P28,599.13, and interest at the rate of 8 per cent per annum from the first day of January, 1904, with costs, and that the steamship <em>Germana<\/em>, if said judgment is not paid, be sold in accordance with law to pay and satisfy the amount of said judgment. No costs will be allowed to either party in this court.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p><em>Case No. 80<\/em>.\u2014This case was brought to recover a judgment for 159,607.81 pesos, with interest, and, in default of payment, for the foreclosure of an instrument alleged to be a mortgage, the sale of certain real estate described in the mortgage, execution in the event of a deficiency, and for general relief. By answer and cross bill the same general defenses were set up as in the other suit. It was further averred that the alleged consideration for the instrument sued on was \"padded and fictitious,\" contained duplications of the same item, and included the item of 30,000 pesos which was the subject of the other case; also that the instrument sued on was not in law a mortgage, but was an agreement for the transfer of property with right of repurchase (<em>pacto de retro<\/em>), and that the defendant had never refused to perform such contract, but that the plaintiff had failed to perform its own obligations thereunder; also that the plaintiff had wrongfully taken possession of the property in question and received its rents and profits. The defendant demanded that the entire transaction be set aside, that plaintiff's suit be dismissed, and that plaintiff account for the rents and profits it had received.<\/p><p>The court of first instance found against the plaintiff, and rendered judgment in favor of the defendant guardian for the gross amount of the rents adjudged to have been unlawfully collected by the plaintiff. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands and was there docketed as case No. 3472. The appellate court held \"that the evidence is not sufficient to establish any of the defenses or counterclaims,\" and \"that the defendant Martinez, at the time the action was commenced, was indebted to the plaintiff in at least the sum of P159,807.81, was fully established by the evidence.\" The court, however, decided that the instrument claimed to be a mortgage was not such, but was \"a promise to sell real estate upon certain terms, and contemplates a subsequent contract of sale which should contain the terms stated in this document,\" and that sufficient facts were stated in the complaint \"to constitute a good cause of action for the specific performance of the contract.\" After referring to the fact that plaintiff had been in possession of certain of the real property described in the complaint, and collected rentals therefrom, the court concluded its opinion as follows:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"The net amount collected should be applied in reduction of the sum of 159,607.81 pesos, which, according to the evidence, the defendants owe to the plaintiff. When the case is remanded the defendant should have an opportunity to question the expenses claimed to have been met by the plaintiff in connection with its possession of these buildings, which it has deducted from the gross amount received.<\/p><p>\"After a consideration of the whole case, we hold that the plaintiff is entitled to a judgment in the court below, with costs, declaring that Francisco Martinez is justly indebted to it in the sum of 159,607.81 pesos, less such sum as that court may decide should be credited to Martinez for the net receipts from the real estate in question in this case, with interest on the balance from February 25th, 1905, at 8 per cent per annum; and ordering that Francisco Martinez and Vicente Ilustre, as guardian of Francisco Martinez, execute and deliver to the plaintiff, within a time to be fixed, by the court, such a contract as is contemplated by the contract of June 15, 1903, which should be substantially in the form of the instrument above referred to of date February 12th, 1904, omitting therefrom however, the steamer <i>Germana<\/i>. The judgment should contain a provision that whatever may be realized from the sale of the <em>Germana<\/em> under the judgment in case No. 3471 shall be considered as a partial payment when realized upon the amount found due in this action.<\/p><p>\"The judgment of the court below is reversed, and the case is remanded with instructions to that court to enter judgment for the plaintiff in accordance with the views herein before expressed. No costs will be allowed to either party in this court.\" (10 Philippine, 257.)<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The following judgment was subsequently entered:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"It is hereby ordered that the judgment of the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, appealed from and dated March 29, 1906, be reversed and the case remanded to the court from which it came, with directions to the judge to enter judgment in favor of the plaintiff in accordance with the decision of this court, without special provision as to the costs of this appeal.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The present separate appeals from the aforementioned judgments of the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands were then taken. The petition for the allowance of the appeal in the first case (No. 79 here; No. 3471 in the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands) expressly recited that the amount in controversy therein \"is 30,000 pesos, equivalent to $15,000 U. S. currency.\" It was, however, asserted that the cause was \"an incident and part' of the same transaction and controversy involved in cause No. 3472,\" and that the two cases \"were * * * consolidated and tried together in the court of first instance.\" The appeal was allowed by one of the Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands. In doing so, he declared \"that * * * there was not a strict consolidation of the two cases * * * between the same parties by virtue of an express order of the court, and in accordance with the procedural law, and * * * the amount in litigation in the first of the said cases does not exceed $15,000 United States currency.\" However, substantially upon the ground of the \"connection and intimate relation\" between the cases, \"the doubt produced by reasons advanced as to whether or not the appeal interposed in case No. 3471 is admissible, notwithstanding the fact that the amount involved does not reach the sum of $25,000 United States currency,\" was left to be determined by this court. The appeal in the second case was allowed by the same justice, it being recited that it appeared \"that the amount involved exceeds $25,000 United States currency.\"<\/p><p>In the argument at bar, counsel for appellee moved that the two appeals be dismissed for want of jurisdiction in this court. We, therefore, first proceed to consider this question.<\/p><p>The claim of want of jurisdiction in No. 79 is based upon the contention that the questions presented in the case could only he reviewed provided the value of the matter in controversy exceeds $25,000 (sec. 10, Act of July 1, 1902, 32 Stat. at L., 691, 695, Chap. 1369, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp., 1909, p. 226), and that the value is less than that sum. We are of opinion that the objection is well taken. True, it is contended for the appellant that the amount awarded to the plaintiff by the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands was 28,599.13 pesos and interest, and that the defendant's counterclaim for the vessel and the receipts from the use of the sum amounted to 38,000 pesos, and that the two amounts should be aggregated in determining the value of the matter in controversy. The case of Harten <em>vs.<\/em> Loffler, 212 U. S., 397, 53 L. ed. 568, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep., 351, is cited as authority. But conceding that cases may arise where the amount of a judgment in favor of a plaintiff may be combined with the sum demanded in a dismissed counterclaim of a defendant, to determine whether the jurisdictional value exists, manifestly this is not a case for the application of the doctrine. The value of the matter in dispute in this court is the test of our jurisdiction. (Hilton <em>vs.<\/em> Dickinson, 108 U. S., 165, 27 L. ed., 688, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep., 424. What, therefore, is that matter, is the question to be considered. Plainly, it is whether Martinez was indebted to the bank, as adjudged below; since, if the indebtedness existed, the amount thereof is the extent of the loss which the estate of Martinez can sustain; because irrespective of what might be the proceeds of sale of the vessel or of other property of the estate of Martinez, if realized upon, no more of such proceeds could be taken than would be sufficient to satisfy the judgment. The jurisdictional value, however, plainly would not exist even if the vessel and its profits were treated, as the matter in dispute, since, as we have seen, the appellant only asserts that the value of the vessel and the profits aggregated 38,000 pesos, less than $25,000. See in this connection, the case of Peyton <em>vs.<\/em> Robertson, 9 Wheat. 527 6 L. ed., 151, approvingly cited in the Hilton case, supra.<\/p><p>We are unable to assent to the view that the case should be treated as having been consolidated with No. 80.; in other words, that the two cases are in reality but one. The suits were separately commenced, and although tried together, this was done for convenience, and the cases were tried not upon the theory that they were consolidated, but as being separate and distinct suits. Thus, it is recited in the record, that at the commencement of the trial, on February 28, 1906, it was stipulated, \"that these two cases, Nos. 3363 and 3365, may be tried together, and that the defendants may amend their answer in 3365 as soon as they have opportunity, as of this date.\" Again, in the course of the examination of one Taylor, a witness for the plaintiff, counsel for the defendant objected to a question, whereupon the following colloquy ensued:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"MR. ODLIN: We are trying both cases together, but I can take him off the stand and put him back.<\/p><p>\"MR. GIBBS: If this question is asked with reference to 3365, I desire to make the further objection to the introduction of the evidence, for the reason that the complaint in that case does riot state a cause of action.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The understanding of the trial judge that there was in fact no consolidation of the two cases is evidenced by the judgment which was entered by him, and that the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands entertained the same view is shown by the judgment which it entered.<\/p><p><em>As to No. 80<\/em>.\u2014The objection is that the judgment of the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands is not a final one. This objection must prevail for the reason that, although involving a decision upon the merits of the case, the judgment of the Supreme Court contemplates and requires further proceedings in the lower court, not inconsistent with its opinion. (Clark <em>vs.<\/em> Roller, 199 U. S., 541; 50 L. ed., 300, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep., 141.) The Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands did not, in its judgment, as was done in the judgment entered in case No. 79, fix and determine the precise amount for which the trial court should enter judgment. On the contrary, its direction was that judgment be entered \"in favor of the plaintiff in accordance with the decision of this court.\" On referring to the opinion, it is seen that the Supreme Court deemed that the plaintiff was entitled to a judicial determination of the amount of the indebtedness of Martinez to it. It is patent that the court found that the exact amount could not be determined without further proceedings, since it in effect left the case open in the trial court for a hearing upon the question of the amount of expenses incurred by the bank in and about the real property of Martinez of which it had taken possession. Thus, in the opinion of the appellate court, it was said:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"The net amount collected should be applied in reduction of the sum of 1.59,607.81 pesos, which, according to the evidence, the defendants owe to the plaintiff. When the case is remanded, the defendant should have an opportunity to question the expenses claimed to have been met by the plaintiff in connection with its possession of these buildings, which it has deducted from the gross amount received.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>It follows that although the appellate court fixed the rights and liabilities of the parties, it in effect referred a question in the case to the subordinate court for further judicial action; hence its judgment was not final for the purpose of an appeal or writ of error. (Drake <em>vs.<\/em> Kochersperger, 170 U. S., 303; 42 L. ed., 1046; 18 Sup. Ct. Rep., 942; Clark <em>vs.<\/em> Kansas City, 172 U. S., 334, 43 L. ed., 467, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep., 207;) Until, therefore, the trial court by its judgment ascertains and fixes the actual indebtedness for the plaintiff, and complies with the other directions contained in the mandate, it cannot be said that a final decree has been entered in the cause. Indeed, on the very face of the decree of the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands, it is manifest that this court, if it took jurisdiction, could not finally dispose of the case in the event it affirmed the judgment below, since all it could do would be to consider the matters determined by the Supreme Court, and do as that court did, remand the cause for further proceedings in order that the rights of the parties might be thereafter finally passed upon. But the foundation upon which rests the doctrine, which, as a general rule, limits the appellate jurisdiction of this court to final judgments, is that cases should not be brought here by piecemeal through the medium of successive appeals.<\/p><p>The motion to dismiss the appeal in each of the cases must be granted.<\/p><em>Dismissed for want of jurisdiction<\/em>.\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 <br\/><hr align=\"LEFT\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> 220 U.

From that decision the defendants appealed to this court and made several assignments of error.<\/p> <p>The undisputed facts, as presented by the record brought to this court, seem to be as follows:<\/p> <p>That on the 23d day of April, 1897, Juan Banatin died, leaving a widow (Damasa Alcala), the plaintiff herein, and seventeen nieces and nephews, whose names are set out in the petition; that on the 13th day of June, 1897, the said widow and all of the seventeen nieces and nephews, except Tranquilina Banatin, entered into a voluntary agreement among themselves for the division \"entre ellos,\" of all of the property left by the said Juan Banatin, deceased, except the house described in paragraph 4 of the petition; that by the terms of said agreement, the said house was to remain undivided; that the widow (the plaintiff herein) should receive the one-half of the usufruct of said house during her lifetime; that the other one-half of the usufruct should be distributed equally among the other seventeen heirs; that Francisco Salgado, one of the nephews, should administer the said house, collecting the rents of the same and deliver one-half to the widow (Damasa Alcala) and the other one-half to the nieces and nephews; that Francisco Salgado, having failed to pay to Damasa Alcala her share of the usufruct of said property, was sued by her and a judgment was finally rendered against him for the same. (Alcala <em>vs<\/em>. Salgado, 7 Phil. Rep., 151.) An execution was issued upon said judgment and one-half of the undivided property in question was sold some time in the year 1907, to one Macario Decena. On the 22d and 24th days of October, 1908 (see Exhibits 2 and 3), the said one-half of the property in question was repurchased by the heirs of Francisco Salgado. The money used in repurchasing the property by the heirs of Francisco Salgado was the money of four of the heirs of Juan Banatin, to wit: Modesta Pabalan, Procopio Pabalan, Basilio Salgado, and Juan Banay-banay (see Exhibit 4 of defendants herein), and not the money of the heirs of Francisco Salgado. On the 25th day of November, 1908, thirteen of the nieces and nephews or heirs of Juan Banatin, by means of a public document, recognized the right of the said Modesta Pabalan, Procopio Pabalan, Basilio Salgado, and Juan Banay-banay as the owners of the one-half of the undivided property in question. (See Exhibit 5.) On the 25th day of November, 1908, sixteen of the heirs of the said Juan Banatin, by a public document, unanimously appointed the said Modesta Pabalan as \"administradora\" of all of the house in question, in substitution of the said Francisco Salgado deceased. (See Exhibit 6.) Since the 25th day of November, 1908, until the commencement of the present action, Modesta Pabalan had administered the property in question, collected the rents of the same and had paid the one-half of said rents to the plaintiff herein as the usufructuary of the one-half of said property.<\/p> <p>The first assignment of error made by the plaintiff is that \"El juzgado erro al estimar que la testamentaria del finado Juan Banatin no ha finalizada.\"<\/p> <p>With reference to this assignment of error, the heirs of Juan Banatin were at perfect liberty to divide the estate among themselves, assuming the responsibility of any debts which might exist. There is no proof that any debts existed. After the actual division of the estate among themselves they became the absolute owners of their respective allotments and were tenants in common of that portion of the property which remained <em>pro indiviso<\/em>. After the mutual agreement among themselves for the division of the estate, either actually distributing their respective shares or leaving the same undivided, the property in question was no longer the property of the estate of Juan Banatin, but the undivided property of the heirs. They were tenants in common of that portion of the property which remained undivided. As such tenants in common the majority of them had a right to agree upon the appointment of an administrator of their property. (Art. 398, Civil Code.) The property belonged to them. They had a right to administer it.<\/p> <p>The lower court in appointing the plaintiff and appellee as administratrix of the property in question, evidently did so upon the theory that the said property was still the property of the estate of Juan Banatin. In this theory the lower court was mistaken. There was nothing left of the estate of Juan Banatin to be administered. The heirs by mutual agreement had divided the property among themselves. There was no occasion and no reason for the appointment of an administrator by the probate court, and, therefore, the judgment of the lower court appointing Damasa Alcala as administratrix of the estate of Juan Banatin for the purpose of administering the property mentioned in paragraph 4 of the petition, is hereby revoked.<\/p> <p>We deem it unnecessary in the present case to discuss the right of a usufructuary to manage or assist in managing or to administer the property in usufruct which belongs to tenants in common. That question is not presented in the present cause.<\/p> <p>Without any finding as to costs, it is hereby directed that a judgment be entered reversing the judgment of the lower court appointing Damasa Alcala as administratrix of the property in question. It is so ordered.<\/p> <p><em>Torres<\/em> and <em>Mapa, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<br\/> <em>Carson<\/em> and <em>Moreland, JJ.,<\/em> concur in the dispositive part.<\/p><\/div>",

After waiting the\u00a0 proper time for the plaintiff to pay the indebtedness upon\u00a0 which the mortgage was based, and he not having made such payment, said parcels of land, under the terms of said judgment, were offered for public sale and were sold to said Villanueva at public auction on the 3d day of September, 1906, he being the highest bidder at said sale. Thereafter and on\u00a0 the 12th day of September of the same year, the said defendant, through the activities of the sheriff, entered into possession of the property, including one of the pieces of land called parcel No. 2.\u00a0\u00a0 Upon delivering possession of said parcel No. 2 to the defendant Villanueva, -the sheriff found\u00a0 that\u00a0 there\u00a0 was a house built upon said lot, which house was not specifically mentioned in the description of parcel No.\u00a0 2, although the land upon which it stood was clearly within the\u00a0 description of said parcel as presented by the documents.\u00a0\u00a0 Fearing that by reason of the failure of such\u00a0 description\u00a0 specifically to\u00a0 mention\u00a0 the\u00a0 house\u00a0 in question\u00a0 his power did not extend\u00a0 to the delivery of the possession of said house, the sheriff informed the defendants that, in the event that the court should determine that said house was not property embraced within the mortgage and legally conveyed under the mortgage sale, they, the defendants,\u00a0 must not only deliver possession but also pay to the plaintiff a proper sum for its occupancy.\u00a0 The employee of the plaintiff who had\u00a0 been in charge of the house up to\u00a0 the time of the delivery of its possession was then notified by the sheriff that he must quit the premises and that the defendant was to occupy them in his stead.\u00a0 The employee, however, loath to leave uncared for certain articles that were there on the premises, asked permission of the sheriff to be permitted to remain there for the purpose of caring therefor. The sheriff\u00a0 informed him\u00a0 that he had\u00a0 no power to give such permission and referred him to the defendants.\u00a0\u00a0 The latter immediately gave permission to the employee to remain upon the premises and look after the property referred to in\u00a0 his petition.\u00a0\u00a0 The defendant placed an\u00a0 employee of his own in possession of the property to care for and\u00a0 protect it from injury or\u00a0 destruction.\u00a0\u00a0 On the 12th day of\u00a0 November of the same year-the court before which the judgment of foreclosure and sale had been obtained, and which ordered the sale of said property under\u00a0 said\u00a0 judgment\u00a0 for reasons which are immaterial\u00a0 here, annulled the sale and ordered a resale of the same.\u00a0 During the month of December the property described in the mortgage, including parcel No. 2 in question was again sold at public sale and again purchased by\u00a0 the defendant Villanueva.\u00a0 Prior to this time, however, and on the\u00a0 night of the 3d\u00a0 of October, 1906,\u00a0 the\u00a0 house located on parcel No. 2 was destroyed by fife.\u00a0\u00a0 The evidence does not disclose\u00a0 in what manner the\u00a0 fire originated\u00a0 or through whose fault or negligence, if of anyone, it occurred. Upon that question the record is wholly silent.<br\/><br\/>The first contention presented by the appellant to this court is that the learned trial court erred in holding that the house in question was included in the sale made by the sheriff under the judgment of\u00a0 foreclosure and sale.<br\/><br\/>We have carefully examined the record in connection with this allegation of error and are thoroughly satisfied that the evidence\u00a0 fully supports\u00a0 the conclusion of the\u00a0 learned trial court\u00a0 in this respect.\u00a0 It appears that the description of the land upon which\u00a0 the house was located is included\u00a0 within the description\u00a0 of parcel No. 2 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 mortgage referred to.\u00a0 The appellant in his complaint and in his argument presents a description of the house and lot referred to\u00a0 somewhat different in words from\u00a0 the description of parcel No. 2.\u00a0 This, however, causes no confusion, inasmuch as it is quite clear that the description of parcel No. 2 fully includes the house and lot described by the appellant.<br\/><br\/>The second contention of the appellant is that the learned trial court erred in finding that the possession of defendants of parcel No. 2, which includes the house and lot in question, was in good faith.<br\/><br\/>As to this contention, the record does not leave us in doubt. It having been found that the description contained\u00a0 in the mortgage includes the house and lot in question, the resolution of the present question is easy.\u00a0\u00a0 In the case of Bischoff <i>vs.<\/i>\u00a0 Pomar (12 Phil. Eep., 690), this court held, Mr. Justice Torres writing the opinion, that - <br\/><blockquote>\"It is a rule, established by the Civil Code and also by the Mortgage Law,\u00a0 with which the decisions of\u00a0 the\u00a0 courts of the United States are in accord, that in\u00a0 a mortgage of real estate, the improvements on the same are included;\u00a0 therefore, all objects permanently attached to\u00a0 a mortgaged building or land, although they may have been placed there after the mortgage was constituted, are also included.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The Civil Code, article 1877, provides that -<br\/><blockquote>\"A mortgage includes\u00a0 the\u00a0 natural accessions,\u00a0 improvements, growing fruits, and\u00a0 rents not collected when the obligation is due.\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\" (Manresa, vol. 12,\u00a0 pp. 499, 500.)<br\/><br\/>From this it is evident that the house in\u00a0 question passed under the mortgage sale.\u00a0 When, therefore, the defendant entered into possession thereof after he had purchased it at the\u00a0 foreclosure sale,\u00a0 he presumably entered into posses- sion honestly and in good faith.\u00a0\u00a0 That he did so is nowhere put\u00a0 in question by\u00a0 the evidence\u00a0 in\u00a0 this case.\u00a0 No direct evidence is given anywhere attacking his\u00a0 motives or his intentions.\u00a0 When the defendant took possession he did so as owner of the\u00a0 property and,\u00a0 even if\u00a0 the mortgage sale had been absolutely void, he would still have been a holder in good faith, being a mortgagee in possession under direction of the court.<br\/><br\/>\"Good faith is always presumed, and any person alleging bad faith on the part of the possessor is obliged to prove it. Possession acquired in\u00a0 good faith does not lose\u00a0 this character,\u00a0 except in the case and\u00a0 from the moment some act exists\u00a0 proving that the possessor is aware that he possesses the thing illegally.\u00a0\u00a0 It is presumed that the possession is still enjoyed\u00a0 in the manner in which it was acquired until the contrary is proved.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Arts. 434, 435, 436,\u00a0 Civil Code.) \"Where a purchaser at a defective foreclosure sale,\u00a0 or his assigns, goes into possession of the mortgaged premises, with assent\u00a0 of the mortgagor,\u00a0 under the right supposed to have been acquired under the\u00a0 foreclosure sale, he will\u00a0 be deemed a mortgagee in possession.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Russell <i>vs.<\/i> Akeley Lum. Co., 45 Minn., 376; Rogers <i>vs<\/i>. Benton, 39 Minn., 39.)<br\/><br\/>\"A purchaser at\u00a0 a mortgage\u00a0 foreclosure sale which is invalid as against the owner of the equity of redemption becomes assignee of the mortgage, and if he lawfully enters into possession of the premises, he becomes\u00a0 a mortgagee in possession, and ejectment will\u00a0 not lie against him by the owner of the equity of redemption.\"\u00a0 (Townshend <i>vs.<\/i> Thomson, 139\u00a0 N.\u00a0 Y., 152.)<br\/><br\/>\"An alienee of a mortgage,\u00a0 who\u00a0 claimed title under a foreclosure sale, acquires\u00a0 all the rights\u00a0 of a mortgagee, even though the foreclosure sale is void for irregularity, so as not to bar the equity\u00a0 of redemption.\u00a0 Being\u00a0 in the position of a mortgagee in possession\u00a0 after breach of condition\u00a0 with the debt unpaid, he\u00a0 has a good defense to an ejectment brought\u00a0 on the bare\u00a0 legal title.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Bryan <i>vs.<\/i> Brasius,\u00a0 162 U. S., 415.)<\/blockquote>The defendant having entered into possession of the property lawfully, he was obligated to exercise only reasonable diligence and\u00a0 care\u00a0 in the management of the\u00a0 property. (Art. 1903, Civil Codej.Wann vs. Coe, 31 Fed., 369;\u00a0 Murdock <i>vs.<\/i>\u00a0 Clark, 90\u00a0 Cal., 427.) Article 457 of the Civil Code reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"A possessor in good faith is not liable for the deterioration or loss of the thing possessed, with the exception of the cases in which it is proved that he has acted with fraudulent intent.\u00a0 A possessor in bad faith is liable for the deterioration\u00a0 or Joss\u00a0 in\u00a0 any case,\u00a0 even in those caused\u00a0 by<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> force majeure,<\/span> when he has maliciously\u00a0 delayed the delivery of the thing to its legitimate possessor.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It\u00a0 appearing\u00a0 from\u00a0 the\u00a0 nature\u00a0 of the\u00a0 relation\u00a0 of\u00a0 the defendant to\u00a0 the property that he was not a holder in bad faith nor a usurper, he is responsible only for those losses which are shown to have been caused by his negligence.\u00a0 No negligence having been shown in this case, the complaint was properly\u00a0 dismissed upon the merits.<br\/><br\/>The judgment is\u00a0 affirmed,\u00a0 without special finding as to costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

The punishable act is qualified by the specific circumstance of treachery, one determining the crime of murder,\u00a0 inasmuch as the offended party was assaulted while his back was turned toward his two aggressors, for, as found from the medical examination of the contusions, the first two\u00a0 blows, struck with\u00a0 clubs, were\u00a0 inflicted upon the victim at the back of the neck; and, further, in the commission of the frustrated crime the said aggressors employed means, ways and modes tending directly and especially to insure the consummation of the crime without risk to their\u00a0 persons such as could have arisen from\u00a0 any defense which\u00a0 the\u00a0 assaulted party might have made, and\u00a0 in the execution of the deed they performed all the acts calculated to produce death;\u00a0 and,\u00a0 although the victim did not die, it was due\u00a0 to causes independent\u00a0 of the will of those who assaulted him; the large number of serious wounds,\u00a0 inflicted by repeated\u00a0 blows administered by the defendants,\u00a0 the majority\u00a0 of them on\u00a0 the head and\u00a0 face, while he was stretched out on the\u00a0 ground and unconscious, the insistency\u00a0 with which they\u00a0 illtreated him,\u00a0 striking him on a part of the body where\u00a0 contusions usually cause fatal results, and the fact that, after such cruel treatment and believing that the injured man was dead, they picked him up from the spot where he had\u00a0 fallen, took him out of the town into the rice fields and left him in a ditch, as if he were a corpse - all these acts reveal marked perversity and evidence their criminal intention to deprive him of his life; in fact they treacherously assaulted him at a moment when he had his back turned to them\u00a0 and when he\u00a0 had no reason to believe, from the conversation the defendants were holding between themselves, that he was to be assaulted in such a manner.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 defendants\u00a0 pleaded\u00a0 not\u00a0 guilty, denied the charge, and alleged the following: Faustino Dolor said that\u00a0 during the entire day of the crime, January 8, 1910, and since the 5th\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 same month,\u00a0 he was sick with fever and did not\u00a0 leave the house.\u00a0\u00a0 Antonino Domingo declared that he was in\u00a0 the barrio of Danyaquin of the pueblo of Santiago, distant about 5 kilometers\u00a0 from that\u00a0 of Santa Maria, engaged\u00a0 in superintending the grinding of his\u00a0 sugar cane, from the morning of the said day until\u00a0 that of the\u00a0 following\u00a0 day, Sunday, without leaving\u00a0 the barrio\u00a0 during that time.\u00a0 This latter defendant testified,\u00a0 moreover, that Juan Edusor, on being\u00a0 examined by the justice of the peace in his presence, swore that he did not know who his aggressors were, although he afterwards\u00a0 designated this defendant\u00a0 by name as being one of them, which was not true. But notwithstanding these allegations\u00a0 of the\u00a0 defendants and\u00a0 the testimony of their\u00a0 supporting witnesses, sufficient evidence was presented at the trial to\u00a0 produce in the mind the full conviction, beyond all\u00a0 doubt, of the\u00a0 defendants' guilt as the principals, by direct participation, of the wounds and\u00a0 contusions, some of\u00a0 them serious,\u00a0 inflicted upon the offended party on the night aforementioned.<br\/><br\/>Juan Edusor, the victim, averred in a positive manner that, a few moments prior to the assault and while he was in the place where he was assaulted\u00a0 by the\u00a0 defendants, the latter were engaged in conversation, and that, as they all knew each other\u00a0 very well and were friends, he recognized his\u00a0 assailants perfectly\u00a0 in\u00a0 spite of the darkness; the moon was not\u00a0 shining,\u00a0 but\u00a0 the starlight\u00a0 enabled him to\u00a0 see and recognize them,\u00a0 and he also recognized\u00a0 their voices.\u00a0\u00a0 Two residents of the locality, Eulogio Foronda and German\u00a0 Foronda, testified to their having seen the defendnts going along the main highway of the town of Santa Maria in the\u00a0 direction\u00a0 of the town at about 9 o'clock on the evening of the crime, while the witnesses\u00a0 were going in an opposite direction to fish, and that the following words passed between the defendants: \"nos\u00a0 vamos ya, bien que ya\u00a0 esta guardado\"\u00a0 and\u00a0 they then recognized him well, for they were old acquaintances\u00a0 of his; that on the following day when they learned of\u00a0 what\u00a0 had occurred they suspected from those words that\u00a0 the defendants had\u00a0 done something; later, their suspicions\u00a0 were confirmed\u00a0 by the statement made by the\u00a0 wounded man\u00a0 after he was picked up from\u00a0 the rice field, to the\u00a0 effect that Antonino Domingo was one of those\u00a0 who\u00a0 on the evening in\u00a0 question struck him the\u00a0 blows with the club.\u00a0 Owing to the seriousness of his wounds, he did not at the time remember the name of the other assailant.<br\/><br\/>It is true that the only witness\u00a0 who directly\u00a0 designated the defendants as the perpetrators\u00a0 of the crime was the offended\u00a0 party himself; yet since\u00a0 no other witness was present at the commission of the crime than the aggrieved party himself, and his testimony given at the trial appears to be corroborated by other incriminating evidence, such testimony by the\u00a0 aggrieved party may serve as grounds for a conviction, if it\u00a0 is supported\u00a0 at\u00a0 trial by other circumstantial evidence.\u00a0 In this case two other witnesses, Claudio Escobar and Eugenio Espiritu, confirming\u00a0 the statements made by the victim and\u00a0 by the said two resident fishermen,\u00a0 testified, Escobar, to his having seen Faustino Dolor leave his house, cross the street and bathe himself in a well near his\u00a0 (Escobar's) house, on the said 8th day of January, and therefore he could not have been dangerously sick\u00a0 with fever;\u00a0 and\u00a0 Espiritu,\u00a0 to his having\u00a0 seen the defendants seated\u00a0 by the roadside between 7\u00a0 and 8 o'clock that evening armed\u00a0 with clubs and conversing together.\u00a0 The testimony of these witnesses is a refutation of the allegations made by the defendants that one of them was sick in\u00a0 his house, and the other absent in a barrio 5 kilometers away on\u00a0 the evening of\u00a0 January 8, 1910,\u00a0 and offsets in a positive manner\u00a0 the testimony of the witnesses called by the defendants.<br\/><br\/>It can not be held that t\"he perpetration of the said crime was attended by any extenuating or aggravating circumstance, for the reason that the circumstances of abuse of superiority and of nocturnity, taken advantage of in the execution of the deed, are included\u00a0 in the qualifying\u00a0 circumstance of <i>alevosia <\/i>and, in the present case, are involved in the consummation of the crime of frustrated murder; wherefore the corresponding penalty should be imposed upon the defendants in the medium degree.<br\/><br\/>With respect to\u00a0 the multiplicity of errors attributed to the trial judge by the defendant's counsel, it must be kept in mind that the question addressed to the offended party, Juan\u00a0 Edusor - who was still suffering from the effects of the atrocious illtreatment inflicted by the defendants,\u00a0 and well aware that the courts were\u00a0 investigating his case - as to whether anything had occurred between him and the defendants on\u00a0 the evening of January 8, can in\u00a0 no manner be\u00a0 considered\u00a0 a\u00a0 leading one, like others bearing on\u00a0 the investigation of the crime, its circumstances, and its perpetrators, unless we establish the theory that, in order not to prejudice criminals it shall neither be permitted to proceed with the investigation of the crime, nor to address any question whatever to the witnesses for the prosecution conducive to the result sought by the proceedings.<br\/><br\/>The law\u00a0 prohibits all questions which suggest to the witness the answer intended to be obtained by the questioner; but not those the purpose of\u00a0 which is to discover the truth of the facts that occurred, and it authorizes the judge to rely upon\u00a0 his discretion and good judgment in\u00a0 deciding upon the relevancy and propriety of\u00a0 the questions which may be put to the witness, to the end that, in passing judgment, he may be enabled to administer strict justice, with rectitude and impartiality.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the denial of the motion for a new hearing, the grounds on which this decision rest justify\u00a0 the ruling of the judge and show that the sole\u00a0 testimony of Juan Directo, new evidence subsequently discovered, according to the defense of the accused, even\u00a0 were it admitted in the terms expressed\u00a0 by the affidavit which accompanied the motion, would not have affected the final\u00a0 result of\u00a0 the cause.\u00a0 It might be true that, at half past 5 o'clock of\u00a0 the afternoon of the said day, January 8, Juan\u00a0 Edusor fought with\u00a0 Martin Imperial and Faustino Agoyaoy with clubs; but, besides its not\u00a0 being shown what was the result of\u00a0 the fight, it is\u00a0 further\u00a0 proven that before\u00a0 8 o'clock on that evening\u00a0 the\u00a0 said Edusor\u00a0 was seriously\u00a0 illtreated\u00a0 by\u00a0 the defendants who left him unconscious and abandoned in a ditch\u00a0 in a field - facts entirely different from those set forth in the said affidavit, and\u00a0 therefore the testimony of\u00a0 the aforementioned\u00a0 Juan Directo, though it\u00a0 may\u00a0 prove a new fact, could not prove that\u00a0 the charge under which\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendants are held to be liable was false.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, it is\u00a0 proper, in\u00a0 our opinion, to reverse the judgment appealed from, and we hereby sentence\u00a0 Antonio Domingo and Faustino Dolor,\u00a0 as the perpetrators of frustrated murder, each to the penalty of twelve years and one day of <i>cadena temporal<\/i>, to the accessory penalties provided by article\u00a0 56\u00a0 of the Penal Code, to indemnify the offended party in the amount of P35, without subsidiary imprisonment in view of the nature of the principal penalty, and each to\u00a0 pay one-half\u00a0 of the costs of both instances.

Charles S.\u00a0 Lobingier\u00a0 presiding, and sentenced to imprisonment for one year and one day, to indemnify the injured\u00a0 party for the value\u00a0 of the property damaged or destroyed, and to\u00a0 pay the costs\u00a0 of the trial.<br\/><br\/>The questions involved in this case are very largely of fact.\u00a0\u00a0 The learned\u00a0 trial judge in his opinion, which forms the basis of his judgment of conviction, presents the facts with\u00a0 clearness and force.\u00a0 He says:<br\/><blockquote>\"The following are established by the undisputed evidence as facts in this case:<br\/><br\/>\"On the afternoon of July 6, last,\u00a0 the two accused after spending\u00a0 several hours\u00a0 together\u00a0 and drinking freely\u00a0 of intoxicating liquors (p. 48) entered a house of prostitution on Calle Balic-Balic in the District of Sampaloc, each occupying a\u00a0 room with one of the inmates\u00a0 (pp. 24, 44).\u00a0 The accused remained in the house at least a quarter of an hour and were the only men there (p. 32).\u00a0 As they were leaving, an alarm of fire was given and the defendant Balmori ran from the house arid was pursued and later overtaken and apprehended by one of the women employed in the house who then\u00a0 and there charged the said accused with causing the fire (p.\u00a0 49).\u00a0 The other accused,\u00a0 Apostol, disappeared and was not seen after Balmori left him (p. 51).\u00a0\u00a0 The fire for which the alarm was given was in a room occupied at the time by one Agapita Rivera.\u00a0\u00a0 A policeman (Woodward) who arrived soon after found the walls and roof scorched and the bedding, bed-trimmings and a quantity of woman's apparel partially burned and the\u00a0 bed itself ruined (p. 41).<br\/><br\/>\"The only real points in dispute are the identification of the incendiaries\u00a0 and the extent\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 damage.\u00a0 Agapita Rivera, who was in\u00a0 the room where the fire occurred, testifies\u00a0 (pp. 23, 24, 29, 30)\u00a0 that the\u00a0 two accused entered there from\u00a0 the other\u00a0 rooms where they\u00a0 had been staying, that Balmori\u00a0 lit\u00a0 a cigarette and then\u00a0 struck\u00a0 a match which he applied to a\u00a0 bundle of skirts hanging on the wall and handed it to Apostol who applied it to the bed-trimmings, and that both accused then started to run\u00a0 down the stairs.\u00a0 A rigid cross-examination leaves this\u00a0 testimony\u00a0 unshaken.<br\/><br\/>\"Pilar Fajardo, who\u00a0 was below\u00a0 and pursued and apprehended Balmori,\u00a0 testifies (pp. 33, 35)\u00a0 that she did so because Agapita Rivera called out to her from the room in question\u00a0 which she was just leaving, to pursue the accused as the incendiaries.\u00a0 Petra Angeles also\u00a0 testifies (p.\u00a0 3) that she\u00a0 heard the cries to detain the accused and that she saw them descending the staircase.\u00a0\u00a0 Agapita Rivera's cries. at the moment the fire broke out\u00a0 are part of the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">res gestae<\/span> with all the\u00a0 weight which belongs to such evidence and her identification of the accused is thus corroborated to a certain extent by two other witnesses.\u00a0 It\u00a0 is only contradicted by the testimony of one of the accused,\u00a0 Balmori, who says that he did not enter the room in question.\u00a0 Either his testimony or that of the women and especially that\u00a0 of Agapita Rivera must\u00a0 be\u00a0 rejected on\u00a0 this point and\u00a0 we think that the surrounding circumstances render the testimony of the women more\u00a0 trustworthy.\u00a0 In the first place it\u00a0 is doubtful if the only accused who testified was in a position to remember what\u00a0 he\u00a0 actually did at the time\u00a0 in question.\u00a0\u00a0 As already stated he had been drinking freely\u00a0 and he himself admits (p. 46) that his\u00a0 mind was not entirely clear until the next morning\u00a0 after a night in jail.\u00a0\u00a0 We\u00a0 are disposed\u00a0 also to agree with the prosecuting attorney that the act which is charged is just such a one as\u00a0 would be committed by men in the initial stages of intoxication.\u00a0 The person or persons who started the fire evidently did not intend\u00a0 to burn the building,\u00a0 else they would have applied the match to some more inflammable portion.\u00a0 Their purpose apparently was malicious, though less serious, mischief with a possible view of enjoying the scare\u00a0 which the act would cause\u00a0 to\u00a0 the inmates.<br\/><br\/>\"In\u00a0 the second place the defendants' theory\u00a0 would leave no reasonable explanation as to the cause of the fire, which, it is\u00a0 conceded,\u00a0 occurred.\u00a0 It is unreasonable to suppose that the\u00a0 inmates themselves\u00a0 would cause the destruction of their own property and it is shown by the defense (p. 32) that the accused were the only men in the house at the time. The testimony offered by the prosecution affords an adequate explanation of the cause of the fire.\u00a0 The testimony\u00a0 for the defense leaves this wholly\u00a0 unexplained.<br\/><br\/>\"Finally,\u00a0 no motive\u00a0 is suggested on\u00a0 the part of these women for falsely imputing the crime to the accused.\u00a0 The latter were\u00a0 patrons of the house, the injured woman's testimony (p. 31) is undisputed, that there was no\u00a0 preceding trouble and, if the conduct of the accused was not different than as described by defendant Balmori, such\u00a0 a\u00a0 concerted effort\u00a0 on\u00a0 the part of the inmates\u00a0 against the accused as Balmori testifies to would be unnatural and inexplicable.<br\/><br\/>\"Counsel for the defense lays stress upon certain alleged inconsistencies and improbabilities in the testimony of the women, but\u00a0 we do not find anything of\u00a0 this\u00a0 sort\u00a0 which materially affects\u00a0 the essential elements of the case\u00a0 made by the prosecution.\u00a0 If the witnesses do not all agree on the minor\u00a0 points it at least negatives the idea of collusion and if the principal witness for the prosecution is not entirely clear as to the details of the occurrence it must be remembered that the latter was an\u00a0 occasion of much confusion. But on the whole we can find\u00a0 no sufficient reason to doubt the correctness of the main points related by these witnesses and we accordingly find the accused\u00a0 guilty of\u00a0 the\u00a0 offense defined in article 557 of the Penal Code.<br\/><center><br\/>\"THE PENALTY.<br\/><\/center> <br\/>\"For this offense depends upon the amount of the damage caused.\u00a0 At the trial this\u00a0 question appears to have\u00a0 been confused with that of the value\u00a0 of the property destroyed but\u00a0 the two questions are not necessarily identical.\u00a0\u00a0 We take it that the owner of the property was \"damaged\" in an amount\u00a0 which\u00a0 would be needed\u00a0 in\u00a0 order to replace the articles although these might not have sold\u00a0 in the\u00a0 open market for the same amount.\u00a0\u00a0 The list of articles with the value of each as detailed by her (pp. 4, 5, 6) is as follows:<br\/><br\/><table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" width=\"75%\"> <tbody><tr> <td colspan=\"2\">Eight skirts................................................................ <\/td> <td width=\"8%\"><div align=\"right\">P16.00<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td colspan=\"2\">Two blankets...........................................................\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/td> <td><div align=\"right\">8.00<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td colspan=\"2\">One colgadura ........................................................\u00a0 <\/td> <td><div align=\"right\">4.00<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td colspan=\"2\">Three pillows.............................................................\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/td> <td><div align=\"right\">9.00<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td colspan=\"2\">Pour camisas (waists) ...............................................<br\/><\/td> <td><div align=\"right\">28.00<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td colspan=\"2\">Twelve camisas.........................................................\u00a0\u00a0 <\/td> <td><div align=\"right\">36.00<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td width=\"16%\">\u00a0<\/td> <td width=\"76%\">Total..........................................................<\/td> <td><div align=\"right\">101.00<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <\/tbody><\/table><br\/>\"There is no\u00a0 contrary testimony on\u00a0 the question of the value.\u00a0 This witness\u00a0 says that she based her estimates on the cost price and she also states, (p. 17) what is notoriously true,\u00a0 that the prices\u00a0 of such\u00a0 articles were formerly lower than at present. So\u00a0 that we can not fairly presume\u00a0 that if she had gone into the open market to replace these articles they could have been purchased for any less than the original cost, especially as some of\u00a0 them were\u00a0 practically new (p. 14).\u00a0\u00a0 None of them were unserviceable and for those, like the skirts, which were partially worn a deduction was made from the cost price (pp. 2, 13).<br\/><br\/>\"It is not necessary to call an expert to\u00a0 prove the value of wearing apparel\u00a0 in common use (12\u00a0 Am. &amp; Eng. Encyc. of Law (2nd Ed.) 478 n 9; Parmalee vs. Raymund, 43 111. App., 609;\u00a0 State vs. Finch, 70 la., 316;\u00a0 59 Am. Rep., 443). In this case the witness testifies (p. 17) that she has resided some fifteen years in Manila and during that time has been purchasing\u00a0 articles of\u00a0 this class.\u00a0 Under these circumstances and the fact that she purchased these identical goods, we think her testimony, undisputed as it is, regarding their value, must be accepted.\u00a0 But we repeat that the question is not so much one of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">value<\/span> as of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">damage<\/span> and in the absence of any showing on the part of any of the defendants that the complaining witness\u00a0 could replace the\u00a0 destroyed\u00a0 or injured articles for a\u00a0 sum less than that testified to by her we must find that such is\u00a0 her damage and that the penalty falls within paragraph 2 of article 557.<br\/><br\/>\u00a0\"As to the attending circumstances\u00a0 we find that\u00a0 the offense was committed by the accused in a state of intoxication, not shown to be habitual, which is\u00a0 therefore an extenuating circumstance under\u00a0 Penal Code article\u00a0 9 (6). On the other hand the offense was\u00a0 committed in the dwelling of the aggrieved party which\u00a0 is an aggravating circumstance under article 10 (20).\u00a0\u00a0 By virtue of article\u00a0 81\u00a0 (4) we are authorized to counterbalance one\u00a0 of these circumstance against the other, and it\u00a0 not being shown that either of the accused had committed\u00a0 a\u00a0 previous offense we shall apply the\u00a0 penalty in its medium degree, giving the accused also the benefit of the lower medium.<br\/><br\/>\"Each of the accused is therefore sentenced to imprisonment for one year and one\u00a0 day,\u00a0 to indemnify the injured party, Agapita\u00a0 Rivera, in the sum of 252\u00a0 pesetas with subsidiary imprisonment\u00a0 according to\u00a0 law in case\u00a0 of insolvency and to pay the costs of this prosecution.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>We have made a careful study\u00a0 of the evidence and have given careful attention to\u00a0 the very elaborate printed briefs and\u00a0 arguments\u00a0 of the\u00a0 appellants.\u00a0 We are\u00a0 unable, after diligent inquiry, to find any reasons upon\u00a0 which we could base ourselves in reversing the judgment of the court below. The\u00a0 question\u00a0 before\u00a0 us is very largely one of fact.\u00a0 The court below saw the witnesses testify, observed their manner upon the stand, and drew his conclusions\u00a0 as to the\u00a0 weight which ought to be given to the\u00a0 testimony which they gave. We have many times laid it down\u00a0 as a rule, that we will not interfere with the conclusions of the\u00a0 court\u00a0 below based upon the relative credibility of\u00a0 witnesses who give conflict- ing testimony, unless\u00a0 there\u00a0 appears in the record\u00a0 some fact or circumstance of weight or influence which has either been overlooked by the court or has been\u00a0 misinterpreted by him, or has not been given its due weight and significance. We have searched this record in vain for such error.\u00a0 We are painfully aware of the effect which a conviction may have upon the future\u00a0 of these two\u00a0 young\u00a0 men and have given the matter thorough and\u00a0 deliberate consideration. We are also\u00a0 aware that property of individuals must be protected, and\u00a0 that when their rights\u00a0 therein have been invaded,\u00a0 maliciously and\u00a0 criminally, the only redress is in justice.<br\/><br\/>We believe, however, that the judgment should be modified.\u00a0 The facts as presented by the evidence do not warrant the\u00a0 finding of the\u00a0 aggravating circumstance of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">morada.<\/span> (Supreme court of Spain, decision of June 16,1884.)\u00a0\u00a0 Eliminating this, the penalty must be\u00a0 imposed in its minimum degree.\u00a0 With the modification, that each\u00a0 of the accused is sentenced to four months and one\u00a0 day of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">arresto mayor,<\/span> the\u00a0 judgment appealed from is affirmed.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

There was some question in our mind, and we considered it in detail, as to the conclusiveness of the proof, held sufficient by the\u00a0 trial court, relative to\u00a0 the value\u00a0 of certain articles destroyed in the fire; but it clearly appeared that, even if we found, which we eventually did not, that the court below had erred\u00a0 in\u00a0 this particular, the error affected so small a part of the property destroyed that its correction would in no sense alter the criminal penalty imposed.\u00a0\u00a0 There was also much consideration of the question whether or not the\u00a0 defendants ought to be charged with the\u00a0 aggravating circumstance of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">morada<\/span>.\u00a0 The\u00a0 trial court had found that they should.\u00a0 After\u00a0 much\u00a0 study and repeated discussion, we came to the conclusion that they should not be so charged. While we gave the most painstaking consideration to the evidence, we were much less perplexed in arriving at a conclusion as to the guilt of the accused than in arriving at a conclusion upon the two matters, among others, above referred to. We regarded, and still regard, the guilt\u00a0 of the accused as painly proved.\u00a0 We saw and see no way to escape that\u00a0 conclusion.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 more thorough\u00a0 the study\u00a0 of the proofs, the more\u00a0 impossible it appears\u00a0 to\u00a0 arrive at any other result.<br\/><br\/>The learned counsel on this motion presents, in the course of his ingenious and able analysis of the evidence, various arguments attacking our decision.\u00a0 We desire\u00a0 to refer to them for a moment.\u00a0 He\u00a0 opens his argument with this admission:<br\/><blockquote>\"That the fire occurred and that the apparel and household furnishings were consumed, as alleged in the complaint and by the court, are facts not questioned.\u00a0 It is also admitted that the record shows that in all probability the fire was occasioned by the\u00a0 defendants; but it is\u00a0 insisted that there is no creditable testimony whatsoever that defendants either criminally or intentionally caused the fire.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The whole argument of counsel is, by these admissions, confined\u00a0 to the proposition\u00a0 that the accused\u00a0 set the fire accidentally and not intentionally; that they set it innocently and not criminally.<br\/><br\/>It is to be noted that these admissions are in open and direct contradiction to the testimony of\u00a0 the appellant Balmori, who stated under oath, as a witness in his own behalf, that neither he nor Apostol was at any time whatever on the day in question in the room\u00a0 where the fire occurred, nor did they on that day\u00a0 see the woman who was within that room when the fire started, nor did they cause said fire either accidentally or intentionally, or in any manner whatsoever.\u00a0\u00a0 This\u00a0 fact\u00a0 might not\u00a0 be, ordinarily, of very great importance; but when it is observed that the whole essence and soul of counsel's argument is the good faith, the lack of criminal intention,\u00a0 the innocence\u00a0 of mind,\u00a0 of the\u00a0 accused in causing the fire, this denial, in open conflict with every line of the evidence and with express admissions of counsel, should be given at least some significance.<br\/><br\/>Counsel further says:<br\/><blockquote>\"1. The sole question in this case is the single question of fact whether or not Agapita Rivera saw the accused intentionally, and in her presence,\u00a0 without motive on their part or protest on her part, commit the act of incendiarism that she claims to have witnessed.\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 Hence the inquiry is: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Did Agapita Rivera see the origin of the fire, or was her attention first attracted to it after the defendants<\/span> had left the room?\"\u00a0 [The italics are his.]<br\/><\/blockquote>In our opinion, this is not the \"sole question\" in this case. At most it is\u00a0 <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">only\u00a0 one phase\u00a0 of the evidence<\/span>\u00a0 in the case. It is at least an open question\u00a0 whether the accused could not properly and legally be convicted without recurring to the testimony\u00a0 of Agapita Rivera\u00a0 at all.\u00a0 We are inclined to think they could.\u00a0 When\u00a0 two\u00a0 men\u00a0 are\u00a0 seen\u00a0 running hastily down a pair of stairs leading from a burning room just\u00a0 set on\u00a0 fire, with no reason whatever for\u00a0 such haste except to quit\u00a0 the locality before the fire is\u00a0 discovered and they apprehended; who, on hearing from the cries of inmates of the house and bystanders,\u00a0 that the room was on\u00a0 fire, instead\u00a0 of halting\u00a0 and\u00a0 lending\u00a0 assistance\u00a0 to smother the flames, continue their flight; who, while\u00a0 it is asserted\u00a0 that they were running to reach a fire alarm box to call a company to the burning house,\u00a0 and although one was apprehended' and arrested before he\u00a0 accomplished his laudable purpose, the other was left entirely free to effectuate his design, but, nevertheless, did not send in an alarm or return to the burning house to assist the people in preventing its destruction, but, rather, maintained the advantage which the more vigorous pursuit of his comrade had given him and made good his escape; one of whom,\u00a0 when\u00a0 brought to trial, told\u00a0 a story so at variance with all the facts and the evidence that counsel, on this motion, skilled in the analysis of fact and learned in\u00a0 the law applicable thereto, found it necessary to repudiate it substantially <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">in toto; <\/span>when all these facts and circumstances concur and\u00a0 combine, what is the\u00a0 almost inevitable inference as to the responsibility of said persons for the fire\u00a0 in\u00a0 question?\u00a0 And all\u00a0 these\u00a0 facts\u00a0 were presented by witnesses other than Agapita Rivera.<br\/><br\/>It is clear, therefore, that\u00a0 the\u00a0 proposition set forth by counsel as\u00a0 the only question in this case comes far short of being such.\u00a0 It is simply <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">one phase of the evidence <\/span>which may be, according to the point of view, the main or merely the corroborative evidence\u00a0 in the case.\u00a0 When, to the facts above set forth as having been presented by witnesses other than Agapita Rivera, is added the corroborative evidence of the latter, where can a doubt of the sufficiency of\u00a0 the proofs reside ?<br\/><br\/>These considerations, we believe, dispose of that part of counsel's argument in\u00a0 which he says, referring to Agapita Rivera:<br\/><blockquote>\"If she did not see the fire until after the defendants left the room where it broke out, then the natural presumption, and the clear legal presumption, is that the fire, though probably occcasioned by an act of the defendants, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">was purely accidental.<\/span>\u00a0 The\u00a0 mere fact that after\u00a0 defendants left\u00a0 the room where they and Agapita Rivera were a fire broke out does not of\u00a0 itself tend to\u00a0 prove,\u00a0 or raise a presumption, that the defendants intentionally and criminally caused the conflagration.\"\u00a0\u00a0 [The\u00a0 italics are his\u00a0 own.]<br\/><\/blockquote>This argument is without weight because it leaves wholly out of consideration perhaps the most important and possibly the very strongest evidence of the case, already referred to, namely,\u00a0 <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">the conduct\u00a0 of the accused themselves.<\/span> This argument\u00a0 forgets entirely the fact that the accused were seen hastily running down the stairs leading from the room in\u00a0 which a fire had just been started; that they gave every evidence of desiring to escape from that locality with the greatest possible dispatch; that while one was captured, charged\u00a0 at the time with the commission of the crime,\u00a0 the other effected fully his escape for the time, not staying either to call the assistance of the fire department or to aid in smothering the flames from which he was apparently fleeing. This argument forgets entirely that, from every line of the credible proof in the case, there springs the inevitable conclusion that the\u00a0 accused were fleeing from something which they dreaded, and that that\u00a0 something was the fire in\u00a0 the room of\u00a0 Petra Angeles.\u00a0 Why flee if innocent?\u00a0 This question is not fully\u00a0 answered in this case by the statement that having caused the damage, even accidentally, under stress of the excitement and on the spur of the moment, their fear got the better of their judgment and they fled, though innocent. The proofs are all to the contrary.\u00a0 It is very difficult indeed to believe that two innocent men, having\u00a0 accidentally\u00a0 set in operation an\u00a0 agency which, if unchecked, would produce inevitably the destruction of a large amount of property and possibly, if not probably, the loss of human life, would flee from the scene where the destruction initiated by their acts was being wrought, not only without lending the slightest assistance to prevent the destruction of property, but without the smallest regard to the safety of\u00a0 the women whom they left\u00a0 alone in the burning room hemmed in by the flames which they had\u00a0 created.\u00a0 If innocent, they acted strangely at a moment when\u00a0 real innocence would have called most loudly for vindication.\u00a0 If\u00a0 guiltless,\u00a0 they did\u00a0 the very thing that innocence rarely does, put on the trappings of guilt.\u00a0 When persons are charged with\u00a0 crime,\u00a0 it is their present acts rather than their future words which lend color to their intentions.<br\/><br\/>Counsel, proceeding with his argument, attacks vigorously that portion of the testimony of Agapita Rivera in which she declares directly and positively that she saw the two accused set fire to certain wearing apparel and the hangings of the bed, asserting that the force of her direct statement is destroyed by her testimony given on\u00a0 cross-examination, which testimony, he\u00a0 says, seems to indicate that she\u00a0 did not see the accused in the room until after\u00a0 the fire was in progress.\u00a0\u00a0 His strictures upon her and her testimony, based upon\u00a0 isolated and detached portions of her declaration, are, in our judgment, in\u00a0 the\u00a0 main,\u00a0 not justified\u00a0 under\u00a0 a fair construction of her evidence as a\u00a0 whole.\u00a0\u00a0 We must\u00a0 not forget that the presence of the accused in the room in question before the fire started, and that said fire had its origin in acts performed by them, are facts admitted.\u00a0 Her direct and positive statement that\u00a0 the\u00a0 accused\u00a0 intentionally and deliberately set fire to the articles named is so thoroughly and richly corroborated by the conduct of the accused, themselves, as well as by the other evidence of the case, that, even though it be admitted, for the sake of argument, that such statement is somewhat weakened by the vigorous and searching cross-examination to\u00a0 which\u00a0 she was subjected\u00a0 at\u00a0 the hands of two different lawyers,\u00a0 such\u00a0 weakening does\u00a0 not rise to the\u00a0 importance asserted by the learned counsel.\u00a0\u00a0 If her direct\u00a0 testimony\u00a0 is weakened by cross-examination, a thing not\u00a0 admitted\u00a0 as having\u00a0 occurred to any material extent, it is more than compensated by the other corroborative evidence of the case.<br\/><br\/>Moreover, touching further the\u00a0 particular point under consideration, as\u00a0 well as\u00a0 the subject\u00a0 of motive \"to\u00a0 which counsel often refers in his argument, it may not be impertinent to inquire why the\u00a0 accused were in the room at\u00a0 all. It is the uncontradicted proof of the case that they went to that house for a particular purpose; that each one,\u00a0 in company with the woman of his choice, entered a room\u2014 neither of\u00a0 them\u00a0 the\u00a0 room where the fire\u00a0 occurred; that having, as\u00a0 would naturally be inferred, accomplished fully the purpose of their visit, they quitted their respective rooms and entered the hall on their way to the street.\u00a0 Now, the question is, why did they enter the room in question ?\u00a0 What was their purpose?\u00a0 Counsel says, merely\u00a0 to\u00a0 light a cigarette.\u00a0 In view of the fact that a cigarette may be lighted as well in a\u00a0 hallway, as in a furnished room, that answer\u00a0 is not sufficient.\u00a0 How\u00a0 can their purpose in entering that room be interpreted except by subsequent events?\u00a0 No fact of evidence, no theory\u00a0 of counsel, offers the\u00a0 slightest explanation\u00a0 of that purpose, of that entry,\u00a0 other than that given\u00a0 by\u00a0 the\u00a0 clear-speaking events that\u00a0 followed.\u00a0 Only imagination, that creature unchained by fact and unhampered by reality, can furnish a different explanation upon the evidence.<br\/><br\/>But, argues counsel, why should they\u00a0 set the fire in the presence of Agapita Rivera, well knowing that their act was seen.\u00a0 We do\u00a0 not definitely\u00a0 know.\u00a0\u00a0 Neither\u00a0 did we know, in a case before us some months ago, why the accused, in apparent cold blood, killed three grown persons and a little babe in plain view of several persons.\u00a0 We know only that he did it.\u00a0\u00a0 While motive\u00a0 is generally of great importance in a criminal case,\u00a0 it is not absolutely indispensable.\u00a0 The evidence in the case relating to the actual commission of the crime\u00a0 may be\u00a0 so overwhelming that\u00a0 the\u00a0 question of motive may become secondary.<br\/><br\/>It is possible that the\u00a0 accused\u00a0 in this case\u00a0 did not see Agapita Rivera in the room when\u00a0 they set\u00a0 the fire.\u00a0 When they entered she was at the farther end of the room, quietly combing her hair, probably partially hidden by the bed and its\u00a0 hangings.\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover,\u00a0 the accused being in a\u00a0 state of intoxication (it appears from the testimony of the accused Balmori that he was so\u00a0 intoxicated that he\u00a0 fell down while running from\u00a0 the scene of the\u00a0 fire, that his head was not clear\u00a0 until sometime\u00a0 the\u00a0 next\u00a0 day, and that the accused Apostol drank as often as he did) would not naturally have that keenness\u00a0 of perception and clearness of\u00a0 observation which normally would have characterized them.\u00a0 The probabilities are that they knew of her\u00a0 presence\u00a0 for the first time when they heard her protest and\u00a0 call\u00a0 for assistance. The statement of counsel wherein\u00a0 he\u00a0 says:<br\/><blockquote>\"It seems to the writer manifestly apparent why this woman\u00a0 (Agapita Rivera) contradicts herself.\u00a0 The accident occurred.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 effects were\u00a0 destroyed.\u00a0 Defendants\u00a0 being the immediate\u00a0 cause it mattered not to\u00a0 the\u00a0 women\u00a0 of the house whether they had\u00a0 intentionally or\u00a0 accidentally occasioned the loss.\u00a0 The women were resolute in holding them responsible and\u00a0 thus reimbursing themselves for this loss. The simplest way was to present the situation in\u00a0 such a light that the\u00a0 public prosecutor would proceed against the defendants for\u00a0 the crime of incendiarism.\u00a0 But since, as they well knew, the mere fact of the occurrence of the fire did not prove\u00a0 incendiarism, someone must testify to\u00a0 the act of starting\u00a0 the blaze <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">intentionally.<\/span>\u00a0 This fell to\u00a0 the\u00a0 lot of Agapita\u00a0 because she was in\u00a0 the\u00a0 room\u00a0 where\u00a0 the\u00a0 blaze occurred\u00a0 at\u00a0 the\u00a0 time\u00a0 defendants\u00a0 left the\u00a0 room.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>has little\u00a0 force when it is observed that, from the uncontradicted evidence, Agapita denounced the accused <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">on the spot<\/span> as\u00a0 being the intentional\u00a0 authors of the fire.\u00a0 That was the reason why they were pursued.\u00a0 That was the reason why the police were called to take them into custody.\u00a0\u00a0 There was no time for the fabrication of the\u00a0 elaborate conspiracy suggested by\u00a0 counsel.\u00a0 Moreover, none of the\u00a0 women lost anything by the\u00a0 fire\u00a0 except Petra Angeles.<br\/><br\/>For these reasons, the motion for a rehearing\u00a0 is denied.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

United States, supra, is\u00a0 conclusively against\u00a0 the right of\u00a0 appeal by\u00a0 the government from a judgment discharging the defendant in a criminal case after he has been brought to trial, whether defendant was acquitted on\u00a0 the merits or whether\u00a0 defendant's discharge\u00a0 was based upon the trial\u00a0 court's conclusion of law that the trial\u00a0 had failed for some reason to\u00a0 establish\u00a0 the guilt of the defendant as charged.<br\/><br\/>As\u00a0 indicated\u00a0 in the opinion in that case,\u00a0 the\u00a0 protection afforded by the prohibition against the putting of any person twice in jeopardy for the same\u00a0 offense, is a\u00a0 protection not merely\u00a0 against the peril of second punishment, but against being tried a second time for the same offense.\u00a0\u00a0 In that case the court expressly held that:<br\/><blockquote>\"It follows that Military Order No. 58, as\u00a0 amended\u00a0 by Act of the Philippine Commission, No, 194, in so far as it undertakes\u00a0 to permit an appeal by the Government after acquittal, was repealed by the Act\u00a0 of Congress of July, 1902, providing\u00a0 immunity from second jeopardy for\u00a0 the same criminal offense.\"<\/blockquote>But the reasoning of the opinion goes further and denies the right to the Government to procure the reversal of erroneous proceedings and commence anew, save only in those cases in which the fir3t proceeding did not create legal jeopardy.\u00a0 So that, without his own consent, a defendant who has once been brought to trial in a court of competent jurisdiction cannot\u00a0 be\u00a0 again put\u00a0 on trial for\u00a0 the same offense after the first trial has\u00a0 terminated by a judgment directing his discharge, whether his discharge be the result of a formal acquittal, or of a ruling of the court upon some question\u00a0 of law arising\u00a0 at the trial.<br\/><br\/>This\u00a0 court has frequently\u00a0 held\u00a0 that\u00a0 legal jeopardy attaches\u00a0 in\u00a0 criminal\u00a0 proceedings in this jurisdiction after arraignment and\u00a0 plea in a court of competent jurisdiction, at the moment when the first witness is called to the stand and interrogated, and it is\u00a0 quite clear that the defendant in this case having\u00a0 been brought to trial after arraignment and plea and all the government's witnesses having testified on his trial, is entitled to protection against the peril\u00a0 of being again brought to\u00a0 trial for the offense with which\u00a0 he was charged at that trial and this whether the rulings\u00a0 of the trial judge on which he based his order discharging the defendant and dismissing the information were or were not erroneous.\u00a0 (U.

Webb, 38\u00a0 Cal., 467.) Mr.\u00a0 Bishop, in his work upon\u00a0 Criminal\u00a0 Law, sums up the scope and authority of such statutes as follows:<br\/><br\/>\" 'A legislative\u00a0 provision for the rehearing of criminal causes can not be\u00a0 interpreted - or, at least, it can not have force - to violate the constitutional rule under consideration, whatever be the words in\u00a0 which the provision is expressed. When, therefore, a defendant\u00a0 has been once in jeopardy, the jeopardy\u00a0 can not be repeated without his consent, whatever statute may exist on the subject.\u00a0 Such a statute will be interpreted with the Constitution, and be held to apply only to cases where it constitutionally may.\u00a0 And if it undertakes to give to the State the right of appeal, to retry the party\u00a0 charged, after acquittal,\u00a0 it is invalid.\u00a0 And so\u00a0 the writ of error, or the like, allowed to the State, can authorize the State to procure the reversal of erroneous\u00a0 proceedings and commence anew, only in those cases in which the first proceeding did not create legal jeopardy.'\u00a0\u00a0 (1 Bishop Criminal\u00a0 Law\u00a0 (5th Ed.), section 1026.)\"<\/blockquote>The appeal entered in this case on behalf of the Government should be dismissed\u00a0 with\u00a0 costs against the appellant.

Julio Llorente presiding,\u00a0 convicting the accused of\u00a0 a violation\u00a0 of section 57 of Act No. 1189 and sentencing him to one year in prison, to the payment of the costs of the action, and confiscating in favor of the Insular Government the cigarettes sold in violation of the Internal Revenue Law, the factory, the land upon which\u00a0 it stands, the machinery, fixtures, and all other property located therein, and ordering the disposition of the goods and the rendition of an account of the proceeds of the same in the manner provided by law.<p>It\u00a0 is alleged in this\u00a0 case that between the 29th of December, 1908, and the 11th of July, 1909, Calixto Surla, the defendant in this case, being engaged in the manufacture of cigarettes, and being duly licensed thereto by the Bureau of Internal Revenue of the Insular Government, took from said factory and sold for domestic consumption in the locality where the\u00a0 factory was situated 42,000 cigarettes which were properly subject\u00a0 to the tax imposed by section 101 of the Internal Revenue Law [1189] aforesaid without paying\u00a0 the revenue tax thereon.\u00a0 It is also charged in the information that this was the second offense which the accused had committed, he having been fined for a\u00a0 similar act on the 20th\u00a0 of March, 1908.<\/p><p>The\u00a0 shortage\u00a0 of 42,000 cigarettes is not denied.\u00a0 The difference between the prosecution and the defense relates simply to\u00a0 the reason for such shortage, the prosecution alleging that the shortage was due, as above stated, to the secret and unlawful\u00a0 removal of said\u00a0 cigarettes from the factory by the accused for the purpose of avoiding the payment of the tax thereon, the accused asserting that the shortage\u00a0 was\u00a0 due,\u00a0 first,\u00a0 to the consumption\u00a0 of a\u00a0 large number of cigarettes\u00a0 by the operatives in the factory, upon which there is no tax, and, second, to the mistakes made by Eulogio Manalang, the bookkeeper, in entering on the books the\u00a0 number\u00a0 of\u00a0 cigarettes\u00a0 daily manufactured\u00a0 and the number taken from the warehouse and sold. We\u00a0 are convinced that the following findings\u00a0 by the learned trial court are fully sustained by the evidence:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"That the accused\u00a0 is a manufacturer of cigarettes and is the owner of the factory A-5-255, situated in the pueblo of Angeles, Province of Pampanga, P. I., the license having been issued in the name of said Calixto Surla; that on the 9th day of July, 1909, Roullven and\u00a0 Moran,\u00a0 internal-revenue agents, visited the said factory for the purpose of inspecting it;\u00a0 that it appeared, according to the statement of Eulogio Manalang, Surla's superintendent, that Surla had possession of the key to the storehouse, and he being absent, the revenue agents were not able at that time to inspect the warehouse. They were under the necessity of\u00a0 waiting until they\u00a0 could obtain the key,\u00a0 Eulogio Manalang went to get the key but soon returned stating that Surla was sleeping and that he did not dare awaken him. By reason, however, of the insistence of the\u00a0 agents that they would enter the storehouse even though\u00a0 they did so by force,\u00a0 Manalang called Calixto Surla,\u00a0 who finally appeared\u00a0 and\u00a0\u00a0 opened the storehouse. In the presence of the accused the\u00a0 agents proceeded to take an inventory of the cigarettes found therein and also of the books\u00a0 of\u00a0 the factory.\u00a0 They\u00a0 found a shortage of 42,000 cigarettes.\u00a0 Surla admitted such shortage but stated that he did not know to what to attribute the shortage because ever since his first conviction he had always carried the key to the storehouse himself.\u00a0 He further stated that the shortage must be due to the mistakes of his superintendent,\u00a0 Eulogio Manalang.\u00a0\u00a0 The agents then\u00a0 immediately visited the different stores in Angeles and found ten packages of cigarettes\u00a0 from the factory of Calixto Surla\u00a0 upon\u00a0 which the package number had been duplicated.\u00a0 Nine of these\u00a0 packages were present in evidence.\u00a0\u00a0 On the 12th of July,\u00a0 1909, the said internal-revenue agents, accompanied\u00a0 by Mr.\u00a0 Armstrong, another agent, returned to the factory\u00a0 and made an inventory of the materials there, finding there also a shortage of 693 kilos and 740 grams.\u00a0 On this occasion Eulogio Manalang stated to the agent Armstrong that he had made a mistake in the\u00a0 official books of the daily production of the factory and exhibited to said agent a private book which contained as\u00a0 he stated correct notes of the number of cigarettes\u00a0 produced daily by the factory. On comparing the entries in the private book with those in the official registry, great differences were found between them.\u00a0 They aggregate, according to the testimony of the agent, 52,500 cigarettes.\u00a0 If the differences in the entries on the two books had been made to appear in the official book, instead of a deficit of 42,000 cigarettes there would have been an excess of 10,500 cigarettes.\u00a0 On\u00a0 this occasion the\u00a0 accused again stated to agent Moran that from the day he had been convicted before he had never confided the key of the storehouse to anybody else.\u00a0 Agents\u00a0 Roullven and Moran who visited the factory frequently during working hours\u00a0 always found the doors of the storehouse locked\u00a0 with\u00a0 a\u00a0 padlock, and stated that Calixto Surla\u00a0 was always the one\u00a0 who opened the door for them.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>After a further discussion of the testimony presented by the accused the\u00a0 court said:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"In view of all the facts presented in this case the court has arrived at the conclusion that the accused Calixto Surla maliciously and\u00a0 criminally transferred or consented to the transfer\u00a0 from\u00a0 his\u00a0 factory of the 42,000\u00a0 cigarettes\u00a0 in question\u00a0 without\u00a0 paying\u00a0 the\u00a0 tax\u00a0 imposed\u00a0 by law on\u00a0 or before the moment of such transfer, and it appearing that the accused, according to\u00a0 Exhibit\u00a0 A, was convicted on the 20th of March,\u00a0 1908, for a similar infraction of the law, he must by virtue of section 56 of the Internal Revenue Law be punished as a second offender.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>A careful consideration of the record in the cause leads us to agree with the conclusion reached by the learned trial court.\u00a0 The explanation of the shortage made by Eulogio Manalang varied with the time when it\u00a0 was made.\u00a0 The explanations of the accused himself in relation to the same matter are\u00a0 equally unsatisfactory\u00a0 and\u00a0 unreliable.\u00a0 The evidence\u00a0 of the prosecution is clear and definite.\u00a0 It leaves substantially nothing to inference.\u00a0 It appears from the whole case that\u00a0 the court neglected to take into consideration nothing\u00a0 which would\u00a0 benefit the accused.\u00a0 No\u00a0 important or influential\u00a0 fact or\u00a0 circumstance was\u00a0 left untouched, each being given the weight and significance which it legally deserved. <br\/><\/p><p>The trial court also found that the accused had theretofore been found guilty of a violation of section 56 of Act No. 1189.\u00a0 This finding is clearly sustained by the proofs and the facts upon which it is based are not denied by the defendant.<\/p><p>We are, therefore, in accord with the finding of the trial court upon the facts.<\/p><p>The accused asserts that the Act, in\u00a0 declaring forfeited the factory and all of its contents and the ground upon which it stands, is unconstitutional.\u00a0 He\u00a0 also contends that\u00a0 the judgment of the trial court is fatally defective in that it fails to state how the property forfeited shall be disposed of and\u00a0 its proceeds accounted for.<\/p><p>Over the question\u00a0 involving the constitutionality of\u00a0 the aforesaid provision, little needs to be said.\u00a0\u00a0 That the Act is constitutional is not open to question.\u00a0\u00a0 (U. S. <em>vs<\/em>. Stowell, 133 U.\u00a0 S., 1.)<\/p><p>As to\u00a0 the form of the judgment of confiscation,\u00a0 it is sufficient\u00a0 to say that it is entirely immaterial to the defendant, legally speaking, how\u00a0 the property confiscated is disposed of and where its proceeds go.\u00a0 The property, having been forfeited, belongs absolutely to the Government,\u00a0 and the proceeds arising from the disposal thereof also belong to the Government.\u00a0\u00a0 (U. S.<em> vs<\/em>. Stowell, 133 U. S., 1, above.) Section 42 [1189] invoked\u00a0 by the accused for the purpose of demonstrating how the forfeited property should be disposed of,\u00a0 and its proceeds divided, he asserting that under the terms thereof he is entitled to have the balance returned to him\u00a0 after the liquidation\u00a0 of the\u00a0 unpaid taxes\u00a0 and expenses of sale, is entirely inapplicable to forfeited property. It relates solely to the sale of property distrained to\u00a0 pay taxes of\u00a0 delinquents and the\u00a0 disposition\u00a0 of the proceeds thereof.\u00a0\u00a0 The title to such\u00a0 property remains in the delinquent until the sale.\u00a0 It is\u00a0 never forfeited and is never in the government unless it becomes a purchaser at the sale.<\/p><p>The property being his he is entitled to whatever surplus there may be after the payment of the taxes and\u00a0 all the expenses of the distraint and sale.\u00a0 In case of a forfeiture of property\u00a0 for crime, however, the title\u00a0 and ownership of the\u00a0 convict\u00a0 are absolutely divested and pass\u00a0 to the Government.\u00a0 He ceases to have any interest therein.\u00a0 As a result he can have no interest in its proceeds.\u00a0 Section 50 [1189] prescribes the disposition of the property in such cases.<\/p><p>We do not here decide just when\u00a0 the title and ownership pass from the convict to the Government in case of forfeiture - whether at the time the criminal act is committed, or when the government takes possession\u00a0 under the forfeiture, or when the judgment of\u00a0 confiscation is entered. It is unnecessary to a decision of this case.<\/p><p>The judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed,\u00a0 with costs against the appellant.<\/p><p><em>Torres, Mapa, Johnson,<\/em> and <em>Carson, JJ.<\/em>, concur.<\/p><\/div>",

R. Eager, is not indebted in any manner to said\u00a0 Visayan Electric Company.\"\u00a0 To\u00a0 this\u00a0 amended\u00a0 petition respondent demurs, on the ground that as amended it still does not state facts which constitute a cause of action.<br\/><br\/>We are all agreed that, if the\u00a0 petitioner were himself the registered owner of the stock which he\u00a0 seeks to have transferred to Mr. Levering, to whom he alleges he agreed to sell it oh February 25,\u00a0 1910, he would be entitled to his remedy\u00a0 by mandamus upon his amended petition, and that under all\u00a0 the circumstances of this case the mandamus would issue\u00a0 from this court.\u00a0 So\u00a0 far as the petitioner is concerned,\u00a0 the amended\u00a0 petition\u00a0 clearly,\u00a0 definitely\u00a0 and specifically alleges facts which, if true,\u00a0 squarely meet and refute the contention that a mandamus\u00a0 should not issue to compel the secretary of the company to transfer the stock because\u00a0 of the possibility of the existence of unpaid claims against it,\u00a0 a possibility which, as pointed out in the former opinion,\u00a0 might impose upon the secretary a duty to refuse to make such transfer under the provisions\u00a0 of section 35 of \"The\u00a0 Corporation Law.\"\u00a0 (Act No. 1459.) <br\/><br\/>Were the petitioner the registered owner oil the stock, we think\u00a0 that the\u00a0 additional allegations\u00a0 contained in\u00a0 the amended petition, taken\u00a0 together\u00a0 with\u00a0 the allegations in the original petition, would undoubtedly take his case out of the class of \"ordinary\u00a0 cases\" in which Judge\u00a0 Sanborn, in his article\u00a0 on Mandamus in the Cyclopedia of Law and Procedure\u00a0 (26 Cyc,\u00a0 347), says mandamus, by the weight of authority, will not\u00a0 lie; because as it appears and is clearly alleged in\u00a0 the amended petition, first, an ordinary action against the corporation, for damages would in this case be wholly inadequate; second, an action of the nature of a\u00a0 suit in\u00a0 equity to\u00a0 secure a decree ordering the\u00a0 transfer would also be inadequate, in view of the delay involved in the trial and possible appeal of such action,\u00a0 which under the allegations of\u00a0 the amended petition\u00a0 would defeat the principal purpose\u00a0 for which this action is brought, that is to say, to secure to the\u00a0 purchaser the right to\u00a0 vote this stock at the regular and special meetings of the stockholders; and third, because we think that the\u00a0 statute if not expressly, at least impliedly, imposes the duty upon a corporation, organized under Act No. 1459,\u00a0 and the officer in charge of the books\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 of such corporation, to provide for the entry and noting upon the books\u00a0 of the corporation of lawful transfers of stock when the entry of such transfer is lawfully demanded.<br\/><br\/>Section 52 of Act No. 1459 is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Business corporations must also keep a book to be known as the\u00a0 'Stock and transfer book,' in\u00a0 which must be kept a record of all stock, the names of the stockholders or members alphabetically arranged;\u00a0 the installments paid and unpaid on all stock for which subscription has been made, and the date of payment of any installment; a statement of every alienation, sale, or transfer of stock made, the date thereof, and by and to whom made; and such other entries as the by-laws may\u00a0 prescribe.\u00a0 The stock and transfer book shall be open to the\u00a0 inspection of any director, stockholder,\u00a0 or member of the corporation at reasonable hours.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Without\u00a0 inserting the\u00a0 numerous\u00a0 citations with which Judge Sanborn supports the text, we quote at length from his observations on the \"Transfer of shares\" contained in his article on\u00a0 Mandamus\u00a0 (26 Cyc, 347), believing, as we do, that as appears from his discussion of the doctrine, we are supported\u00a0 by both reason and\u00a0 authority in our ruling in this regard:<br\/><blockquote>\"<i>g. Transfer of shares<\/i>. - By the weight of authority mandamus will not lie in ordinary cases to compel a corporation or its officers to transfer\u00a0 stock on its books and issue new certificates\u00a0 to the transferee,\u00a0 since the right is a purely private one, and there is\u00a0 generally\u00a0 an adequate remedy by an action against the corporation for damages or by a suit in equity to secure a decree ordering the transfer.\u00a0 Some courts, however,\u00a0 have held that mandamus will lie, as the remedy by\u00a0 action for refusal to permit a transfer is too doubtful and\u00a0 uncertain in its\u00a0 character to\u00a0 supersede the specific and speedier remedy by mandamus.\u00a0 The writ will lie if it is authorized by statute or, it seems, if the duty to register transfers is\u00a0 expressly imposed by statute,\u00a0 or\u00a0 if there are special circumstances in any case rendering the remedy by\u00a0 action for damages inadequate.\u00a0\u00a0 Mandamus will lie, where the right is clear, to compel a transfer of stock to the purchaser of the same at a judiciarsale, as required by statute.\u00a0 In no case will the writ be granted if the title to the stock is disputed and the right to the relief asked for is not clear, or where the\u00a0 relator's claim rests on a mere equitable right, or equitable issues are involved.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It appears,\u00a0 however,\u00a0 from\u00a0 the\u00a0 original as well\u00a0 as\u00a0 the amended petition, that this petitioner is not the registered owner of the stock which he seeks to have transferred, and except in\u00a0 so far as he alleges that he is the owner of the stock and that it was \"indorsed\" to him on February 5 by the Bryan-Landon Company, in whose name it is registered on the books of the Visayan\u00a0 Electric\u00a0 Company, there is no allegation that the petitioner holds any power of attorney from the Bryan-Landon Company authorizing him to make demand on the secretary\u00a0 of the Visayan Electric Company to make the transfer which petitioner seeks to have made through the medium of the mandamus of this court.<br\/><br\/>Without discussing or\u00a0 deciding the respective rights of the parties which might be properly asserted in an ordinary action or an action in the nature of an equitable suit, we are all agreed that in a case such as that at bar, a mandamus should not issue to compel the secretary of a corporation to make a transfer of the stock on the books of the company, unless it affirmatively appears that he has failed or refused so to do, upon the demand either of the person in\u00a0 whose name the stock is registered, or of some\u00a0 person holding a power of\u00a0 attorney for that purpose from the registered owner of the stock.\u00a0 There is\u00a0 no allegation in the petition that the petitioner or\u00a0 anyone else holds a power of attorney from the\u00a0 Bryan-Landon\u00a0 Company authorizing a demand for the transfer of the stock, or that the Bryan-Landon Company has ever itself made such demand upon the Visayan Electric Company, and in the absence of such allegation we are not able to say that there was\u00a0 such a clear indisputable duty, such a clear legal obligation upon the respondent, as to justify the issuance of the writ to compel him to perform it.<br\/><br\/>Under\u00a0 the provisions of our statute touching the transfer of stock (sees. 35 and 36 of Act No. 1459), the mere indorsement of stock certificates\u00a0 does\u00a0 not in itself\u00a0 give\u00a0 to the indorsee such a right to have a transfer of the shares of stock on the books of the company as will entitle him to the writ of mandamus to compel the company and its officers to make such transfer at his\u00a0 demand, because, under such circumstances the duty, the legal obligation,\u00a0 is not so clear.and indisputable as to justify the issuance of the\u00a0 writ.\u00a0 As a general rule and especially under the above-cited statute, as between the corporation\u00a0 on the one hand, and its shareholders and third persons\u00a0 on the other, the corporation looks only to its books for the purpose of\u00a0 determining who\u00a0 its shareholders are, so\u00a0 that a mere indorsee of\u00a0 a stock certificate, claiming to be the owner, will not necessarily\u00a0 be recognized as such W the\u00a0 corporation and its officers, in the absence of express instructions of the registered\u00a0 owner to make such transfer to the indorsee, or a power of attorney authorizing such transfer. \u00a0<br\/><br\/>The usual practice in the United States in effecting transfers by indorsement and\u00a0 delivery of certificate with power of attorney in blank is thus stated in 10 Cyc, 594,\u00a0 595: \"The usual share certificate contains on its back\u00a0 a printed assignment or\u00a0 indorsement and\u00a0 also a power\u00a0 of\u00a0 attorney in blank, like the following: 'For value received\u00a0 I hereby assign the within named shares to....................,\u00a0 and appoint ........................my attorney to make the transfer\u00a0 on the books of the company.'\u00a0 This is\u00a0 signed by the person to whom the shares are\u00a0 issued.\u00a0 In this manner, by the usages of business, of which the courts take judicial notice, the certificate may be passed from hand\u00a0 to hand indefinitely by the person to whom the certificate is issued simply signing this indorsement and delivering the certificate with the blanks unfilled to his assignee.\u00a0 When it reaches the hands of some one who desires to assume the legal rights of a shareholder, so as to be entitled to vote at corporate elections and\u00a0 to receive\u00a0 dividends, he fills up the blanks by inserting his own name as transferee, just as the holder of a promissory note indorsed in blank\u00a0 is entitled by the law merchant to insert\u00a0 any name\u00a0 he pleases above the indorsement as\u00a0 the payee,\u00a0\u00a0 He also inserts\u00a0 in the second blank the name of\u00a0 the attorney in fact whom he wishes to make the transfer\u00a0 for him on the books of the corporation.\u00a0 This person is usually the secretary or some other officer of the company, although he\u00a0 may insert the\u00a0 name of whomsoever he pleases.\u00a0 The attorney so appointed does exactly what the original shareholder would have done had he gone to the company's office to make the transfer of the shares to his vendee.\u00a0 He makes an entry on the book kept by the company for that purpose, usually the stock ledger, to the effect that the shares have been transferred to the new purchaser.\u00a0 Then the certificate is surrendered, as hereafter indicated, and a new certificate is issued to the transferee.\"<br\/><br\/>It may be that some such method as this was\u00a0 adopted in making the transfer in the case at bar, and that this is what is meant by\u00a0 the allegation\u00a0 of the petition\u00a0 that the stock certificates were \"indorsed\"\u00a0 to the petitioner, but the point having been\u00a0 raised, and there being no\u00a0 express allegation to this effect in the petition, we think the demurrer must be sustained\u00a0 and the petition dismissed\u00a0 with costs, unless within ten days from the receipt of notice of this decision petitioner files an amended complaint.<br\/><br\/>It may be\u00a0 proper to add,\u00a0 in conclusion, that the specific point on which the demurrer to the amended\u00a0 petition is sustained was not directly brought to\u00a0 the attention of\u00a0 the court in the discussion of the demurrer on the original petition, and for this\u00a0 reason, apparently, was not discussed in the former opinion,\u00a0 that demurrer being sustained on a different ground.<br\/><br\/><i>Mapa, Moreland,<\/i> and\u00a0 <i>Trent, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

The legacy over which this action arose\u00a0 was bequeathed to Felisa Hernandez, who died before the\u00a0 testatrix, leaving surviving her the petitioners in this case her only\u00a0 heirs at law and next of kin.\u00a0\u00a0 The testatrix did not alter her will in\u00a0 respect to this legacy after the death of the legatee, although she was cognizant thereof, the deceased legatee being a near relation.<br\/><br\/>Opposition to the payment of this legacy was made by the executor of the will upon the ground that the. legacy having been to Felisa Hernandez and she having died before\u00a0 the testatrix, the legacy necessarily lapsed because, under\u00a0 the provisions of the Civil Code, the heirs and next\u00a0 of kin of a deceased person take only such\u00a0 property as was\u00a0 vested in the deceased at the time of his death; that the legacy\u00a0 not having vested before\u00a0 the\u00a0 death of\u00a0 the legatee such legatee had no interest therein which could pass\u00a0 to her heirs and next of kin.<br\/><br\/>The petitioners rely for relief, and\u00a0 for escape from said provisions of the Civil Code, upon section 758 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u00a0 That section reads\u00a0 as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"When a devise or\u00a0 a legacy is made to a child or other relation to the testator,\u00a0 and the\u00a0 devisee\u00a0 or\u00a0 legatee dies before\u00a0 the testator, leaving issue\u00a0 surviving the testator, such\u00a0 issue shall take the estate so\u00a0 given\u00a0 as the devisee or legatee would have done, if he had survived the testator, unless a different disposition is required by law.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The executor asserts that this provision\u00a0 of the code is inapplicable by reason of the fact\u00a0 that it is in direct\u00a0 opposition to express provisions of the\u00a0 Civil Code above\u00a0 referred to, and that said section having as\u00a0 a part thereof the sentence, \"unless a different disposition is required\u00a0 by law,\" indicates clearly and\u00a0 necessarily that it was\u00a0 the\u00a0 intention of said section to exclude from its\u00a0 operation said provisions of the\u00a0 Civil Code.<br\/><br\/>In\u00a0 our opinion\u00a0 this construction\u00a0 would repeal and annul the section absolutely.\u00a0 The sole and\u00a0 whole object of\u00a0 the section is to avoid the effects of the very provisions\u00a0 of\u00a0 the Civil Code referred to. No other\u00a0 purpose is possible.\u00a0\u00a0 It could not have been, then, the intention of\u00a0 the legislature to destroy by said section the force of said provisions and, in the very section destroying those provisions, incorporate a\u00a0 sentence resuscitating\u00a0 them.\u00a0\u00a0 It would amount\u00a0 to\u00a0 an absurdity to say that the legislature enacted a law and repealed it at the same time.<br\/><br\/>If the petitioners are not entitled to the payment of this legacy, then section 758 has absolutely no value and can produce\u00a0 no results.\u00a0 It might\u00a0 as well\u00a0 never\u00a0 have been written.\u00a0 It is a most flagrant violation of the rules of statutory construction to give to a statute a\u00a0 meaning which, in effect and in reality, repeals it altogether, where any other reasonable construction is possible.\u00a0\u00a0 (Farmers Bank <i> vs.<\/i> Hale, 59 N. Y., 53, 59; Sutherland, Statutory\u00a0 Construction, paragraph 221.)<br\/><br\/>We do not now decide what is the meaning of the phrase referred to, nor to what it refers.\u00a0 That is unnecessary to a decision of the case before us.\u00a0\u00a0 We now simply hold that it will not bear the\u00a0 construction given to it by the opponents of the motion before us.<br\/><br\/>We are of the opinion that the order of\u00a0 the court below requiring the payment of the legacy as\u00a0 petitioned\u00a0 is correct under the law and\u00a0 must be affirmed.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from\u00a0

bold;\">TORRES, <\/span><i style=\"font-weight: bold;\">J.,<\/i><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"> \u00a0<\/span><br\/><br\/>Though the\u00a0 undersigned respects\u00a0 the majority opinion concerning this most important question of law decided in the preceding decision, he can\u00a0 not be convinced that, by section 758 of the Code of Civil Procedure, various articles of the Civil Code - a collection\u00a0 of substantive laws which comprises an entire,\u00a0 complete system of legislation on the testate and intestate succession of a deceased person and on the: rights established by statute, as well those pertaining to heirs by force of law, to voluntary heirs,\u00a0 and to different kinds of legatees\u00a0 recognized by\u00a0 law - were repealed.<br\/><br\/>The said section of the Code of Civil Procedure provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"<i>Devisee dying before testator<\/i>. - When a devise or a legacy is made to a child or other relation to the testator, and the devisee or legatee dies before the testator, leaving issue surviving the testator\u00a0 such issue\u00a0 shall take the estate so given as the devisee or legatee would have done, if he had survived the testator, unless a different disposition\u00a0 is required by law.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In none of the sections of the said Code of Procedure does there exist, in my opinion, any provision whatever contrary to that of the above section, but there are in force various articles of the Civil Code which are entirely opposed to the provisions, partly, of the\u00a0 said section\u00a0 758, and I say <i>partly<\/i> because I do not wish to refer to the legacy left by a testator to his son, inasmuch as this latter, according to the Civil Code, is his heir by force of law.<br\/><br\/>My objection concerns that other relative and legatee who should die before the testator and whose descendants surviving him\u00a0 are\u00a0 entitled, according to the said section 758, to inherit from the said testator and to succeed him in his estate, as if they themselves were his legatees; because this provision is entirely opposed to various articles of the Civil Code\u00a0 which should be respected, as ordered in that very section 758 by the words \"unless a different disposition is required\u00a0 by law,\" therein contained.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiffs who claim the legacy made by the testatrix, Vicenta Hernandez, in behalf of their mother, Felisa Hernandez, a niece of the former, exercise the right of the heirs or successors of the said\u00a0 legatee, and not that of the successors of the testatrix, and as the said legatee died before the testatrix\u00a0 and, therefore, could not have\u00a0 acquired any right whatever to the said legacy, on account of her having died before the testatrix, it is not\u00a0 understood how the aforementioned plaintiffs have been able to acquire a right to the legacy bequeathed\u00a0 to\u00a0 their mother, when she herself, during her lifetime, could\u00a0 not acquire\u00a0 such a\u00a0 right to the said legacy, inasmuch as no provision was made in the will that, in case of the death of the legatee, her children should succeed her in the legacy as if they\u00a0 were the legatees themselves.\u00a0 The right\u00a0 of the legatee\u00a0 is equal to that of the voluntary heir, and article 766 of the Civil Code prescribes:<br\/><blockquote>\"A voluntary heir, who should die before the testator, the person disqualified to inherit, and the person who renounces the inheritance, do not transmit any rights to their heirs, excepting the provisions of articles\u00a0 761 and 857.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>These exceptions do not refer to\u00a0 the case of an heir who dies before the testator.<br\/><br\/>So that the legatee who dies before the testator, as he acquired no right whatever to the legacy, could not in turn transmit such a right to his heirs;\u00a0 he could, while he lived, have entertained the hope of receiving the legacy after the death of the testator, but, in the case at bar, that hope could not be\u00a0 converted into realization because, when the\u00a0 legatee died, the owner of the property out\u00a0 of which the legacy was to\u00a0 be made, still lived,\u00a0 and\u00a0 the premature\u00a0 death\u00a0 of\u00a0 the legatee invalidated her right and she was unable to transmit it to her successors, in this case the children of Felisa Hernandez who claim the legacy of the\u00a0 P2,000 to which legacy their deceased mother was unable to acquire any right whatever, and, therefore, could transmit none to them, for the testatrix was still living.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the right of representation, article 924 of the Civil Code provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"The right which all the relatives of a person have to succeed him in all the rights which he would have if alive, or which he might have inherited, is called the right of representation.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Article 925 of the same code prescribes:<br\/><blockquote>\"The right of representation shall always take place\u00a0 in the direct\u00a0 descending line, but never in the ascending.<br\/><br\/>\"In the collateral\u00a0 line it shall take place only in favor of the children of brothers or sisters,\u00a0 whether they be\u00a0 of the whole or half blood.\"<\/blockquote>The plaintiffs are children\u00a0 of the legatee,\u00a0 Felisa Hernandez, a niece of the testatrix, and\u00a0 therefore can not allege any right\u00a0 whatever of representation with respect\u00a0 to the legacy which their said mother, the legatee, could not receive, because she died before the testatrix, who was only an aunt of hers.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the question at issue, it must be borne in mind that civil\u00a0 personality is extinguished by the death of the persons.\u00a0 (Art. 32, Civil Code.)\u00a0\u00a0 The act by which a person disposes of all\u00a0 his property or of a part of it, to take effect after his death,\u00a0 is called a will.\u00a0\u00a0 (Art. 667 of the same code.)\u00a0\u00a0 The rights to the succession of a person are transmitted from the moment of his death.\u00a0\u00a0 (Art. 657 of the same code.)\u00a0\u00a0 The plaintiffs were unable to allege what right could have been transmitted to them by their mother Felisa Hernandez at the moment of her death, in support of their present claim for the legacy left\u00a0 by the testatrix who survived the said Hernandez.<br\/><br\/>The case at bar concerns a pure and simple legacy, without condition whatever nor term for its delivery,\u00a0 and, with respect to this class of legacies, article 881 of the Civil Code prescribes:<br\/><blockquote>\"A legatee acquires a right to the pure and simple legacy from the death of the testator, and transmits it to his heirs.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The\u00a0 legatee,\u00a0 Felisa\u00a0 Hernandez, having\u00a0 died\u00a0 before\u00a0 the testatrix, Vicenta\u00a0 Hernandez, she, the former, could\u00a0 not transmit\u00a0 to her children\u00a0 any right in\u00a0 the legacy\u00a0 of\u00a0 the P2,000 which the latter left in her will.<br\/><br\/>All the requirements\u00a0 of the said articles and others of the Civil Code, which are in perfect harmony one with another, and form one methodic\u00a0 set of provisions relative to the testate\u00a0 or intestate\u00a0 succession of a deceased person and\u00a0 to the right to inherit by will or by force of law, are those which\u00a0 were expressly\u00a0 respected\u00a0 by the words\u00a0 \"unless a different disposition is\u00a0 required by law,\" contained in\u00a0 the said section 758 which, while it is in accord with the substantive law as regards the\u00a0 legitimate successor of the child and recognizes the right of\u00a0 representation of the nephew of the testator, appears to be in manifest conflict with the said law as regards a relative, as in the\u00a0 case of Felisa Hernandez where\u00a0 her children after her death, which occurred while the testatrix was still\u00a0 living, now claim to be entitled\u00a0 to, receive the legacy left by the latter, not to them, but to their mother, for whom the law allows no right of representation in connection with the said legacy.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 said Act No. 190 lacks a preamble, and even if it had one it would still be inexplicable because, immediately following\u00a0 the provision contained in\u00a0 the said section 758, which\u00a0 destroys\u00a0 categorical provisions of\u00a0 the\u00a0 Civil\u00a0 Code, and in the last\u00a0 lines thereof appear the words \"unless a different disposition is required by\u00a0 law.\"\u00a0 If we are\u00a0 to regard the sense and meaning of these words, we\u00a0 can not but understand that provisions of\u00a0 the Civil Code\u00a0 must be observed and complied with that are\u00a0 notably contrary and opposed to that contained\u00a0 in the\u00a0 oft-cited article 758 of the\u00a0 Code of\u00a0 Civil\u00a0 Procedure, which code can not properly repeal various articles of the Civil Code by\u00a0 the proviso contained\u00a0 at\u00a0 the end thereof.\u00a0\u00a0 The plaintiffs are not testamentary legatees by virtue of the aforesaid will of Vicenta Hernandez.<br\/><br\/>For the\u00a0 foregoing reasons it should\u00a0 have\u00a0 been decided, in our opinion, and found that,\u00a0 with a reversal\u00a0 of the judgment appealed from,\u00a0 the plaintiffs, the children of Felisa Hernandez, are not entitled to receive by right of representation the legacy\u00a0 left by Vicenta Hernandez in her\u00a0 will, and, therefore, the plaintiffs' prayer should have been\u00a0 denied, without special finding as to the costs.<\/div>",

Then it was that the act of the accused became known and\u00a0 was communicated to Florentina.\u00a0 She, although she paid the bets, made a protest to the betting master (<i>casador de apuestas<\/i>).<br\/><br\/>\"It was further proven that Fortunato Acufia is also a gaff-placer, although he\u00a0 does not\u00a0 now work at the trade because two of his fingers are useless. It was also satisfactorily shown that the placing of the gaff is a matter of capital importance and that, according\u00a0 to the way in which they are put on, they are either effective or of no service whatever.\u00a0 That when the point is much elevated and the blade\u00a0 turned out, only slight wounds can\u00a0 be\u00a0 inflicted. (Declaration of the accused Agaton Ner.)<br\/><br\/>\"The witness Francisco Diaz, who testified for the defense, stated that he has been putting on\u00a0 such gaffs for twelve years, and that\u00a0 when the gamecocks were turned loose the gaff on the giraw was much elevated.\u00a0\u00a0 He was the man who let fly the birds.<br\/><br\/>\"It\u00a0 was also\u00a0 proven that\u00a0 Agaton\u00a0 Ner,\u00a0 at the moment the fight began, crossed his bets and laid\u00a0 a\u00a0 wager on the <i>mayahin<\/i> against the <i>giraw<\/i> whose gaff had been taken\u00a0 off and\u00a0 replaced by him, and it is to be noted that when the bets were first being made they were in favor of the giraw, because he was the favorite, but the moment the birds were let fly at each other, the other one, the mayahin, became the favorite, although his owner, Camilo Vice, had\u00a0 only backed him\u00a0 with P15.<br\/><br\/>\"From the facts as proven, the court finds and declares that Agaton Ner is guilty of the crime defined\u00a0 and penalized in paragraph 2 of article 534, read together with paragraph 8 of\u00a0 article 535 of the Penal Code.<br\/><br\/>\"But the cause\u00a0 is otherwise with\u00a0 respect\u00a0 to Valeriano Reus, for, although there are some indications, the evidence is insufficient to\u00a0 prove his guilt, there\u00a0 being no proof of his intention or\u00a0 direct participation, nor with respect to his bets, and he is entitled to the benefit of reasonable doubt.<br\/><br\/>\"The defendant, Agaton Ner,\u00a0 endeavored\u00a0 to prove his innocence\u00a0 by witnesses,\u00a0 but the latter contradicted\u00a0 themselves and testified in such a manner that they were unable to change\u00a0 the opinion formed by the court\u00a0 with respect to preponderance of the evidence adduced by the prosecution over that of the defense.<br\/><br\/>\"Therefore, and taking\u00a0 into consideration\u00a0 the\u00a0 abovementioned articles and others applicable, the court is of the opinion that\u00a0 the accused Agaton Ner should\u00a0 be sentenced to four months and one day of arresto mayor, to the accessories\u00a0 of the law, and\u00a0 to indemnify\u00a0 Florentina\u00a0 Ledin\u00a0 in the sum of P100 and her son, Jose Laureo, in\u00a0 the sum\u00a0 of P82, and in case of insolvency to suffer one month and ten days more of subsidiary imprisonment, and to pay one-half of the costs of this instance.<br\/><br\/>\"The other defendant, Valeriano Reus, is acquitted, with the other half of the costs <i>de oficio,<\/i> and the bond given to insure his liberty shall be canceled.<br\/><br\/>\"The clerk of the court will notify the accused, in the absence of the court, and shall make entry thereof on the record.\u00a0 And, in case of an appeal, he is authorized, with the concurrence of the fiscal, to approve the bond required to assure the liberty of the appellant, which is hereby fixed at P800.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Article 534 of the Penal Code is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"A person who shall defraud another in\u00a0 the\u00a0 substance, quantity, or quality of things he may deliver to him,\u00a0 by virtue of an obligation, shall be punished:<br\/><br\/>\"1.

A. S. Crossfield presiding, foreclosing a second mortgage upon the property of the\u00a0 defendant Francisco Reyes y Mijares, subject, however, to the\u00a0 lien of a first mortgage held by the defendant\u00a0 bank, and declaring\u00a0 that there\u00a0 had not been paid on said first mortgage the sum of P96,781.75, as claimed by the plaintiff, and that said\u00a0 first mortgage\u00a0 had not been fully paid and satisfied.<br\/><br\/>This is an action by the plaintiff as the holder of an alleged second lien upon certain\u00a0 real\u00a0 and\u00a0 personal property to have declared fully satisfied and discharged the first\u00a0 lien held by defendant bank and to have plaintiff's lien foreclosed.\u00a0 The complaint contains two counts.\u00a0 In the\u00a0 first appear\u00a0 allegations showing\u00a0 the\u00a0 second mortgage\u00a0 to\u00a0 the plaintiff, the prior mortgage of the same property\u00a0 to\u00a0 the defendant bank to\u00a0 secure\u00a0 a\u00a0 specific\u00a0 debt, and alleging\u00a0 the subsequent payment of said debt in full.\u00a0\u00a0 The second\u00a0 alleges the pledge of the personal property to the defendant bank to secure the same debt, the subsequent\u00a0 pledge thereof, or of such part thereof as might remain after the payment of the bank's lien, to the plaintiff, the payment to the defendant bank in full of the debt secured by said pledge, and\u00a0 that a portion of said\u00a0 personal\u00a0 property\u00a0 remained unexpended after the payment of the debt aforesaid.\u00a0 The complaint then asks for a foreclosure of the lien of the plaintiff and prays\u00a0 that the defendant bank render an account of all property remaining after the payment of its debt and of all moneys realized over and above the amount of the debt and interest, and that the same be delivered to the plaintiff for the purpose of said foreclosure.<br\/><br\/>The defendants answered\u00a0 denying that the debt of the defendant bank secured by the mortgage and lien had been paid and alleging that the greater part thereof remained unpaid.<br\/><br\/>The cause was submitted to\u00a0 the trial court for decision upon\u00a0 an agreed statement of facts and\u00a0 a judgment was rendered which decreed foreclosure in favor of the plaintiff, subjecting\u00a0 such foreclosure,\u00a0 however, to the first lien of the defendant bank upon the real and personal property described in the mortgage and pledge, upon which there still remained due and unpaid the sum of P75,427.88.<br\/><br\/>The attorney for the appellant\u00a0 states\u00a0 the\u00a0 facts and the case in his brief as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"The facts involved in this contention are not disputed, but are all set forth in an express stipulation, certified as true by the parties litigant.\u00a0 It appears that on March 4, 1905, Francisco Reyes was indebted to the Banco Espanol-Filipino\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 sum\u00a0 of P84,415.38; to\u00a0 the Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank in the sum of P141,702; and to the plaintiff in the\u00a0 sum\u00a0 of P45,286.\u00a0 (Agreed statement Pars. I, II, and VII.)\u00a0\u00a0 On\u00a0 that date the Banco\u00a0 Espanol-Filipino advanced Reyes\u00a0 the money to pay the\u00a0 Hongkong &amp;\u00a0 Shanghai Bank, thus becoming his creditor in the sum total of P226,117.38. Reyes\u00a0 thereupon\u00a0 executed\u00a0 (Exhibit A)\u00a0 a first mortgage upon certain specified real property, to secure the payment of said debt of P226,117.38\u00a0 (agreed statement Par. Ill) and naught else.\u00a0\u00a0 The indenture\u00a0 (Exhibit A) provides:<br\/><br\/>\"'15. Francisco Reyes y Mijares, in addition to the securities above\u00a0 stated as mortgaged and pledged, likewise charges with the complete payment\u00a0 of his obligation in favor of the Banco\u00a0 Espanol-Filipino, his other assets, present and future, particularly the balance to which he is this date entitled in and to the credits\u00a0 against the Government\u00a0 of Spain originally due him or acquired later, and the commission upon the collection of those entrusted to him, which said balance he obligates\u00a0 himself to pay into the hands\u00a0 of the said creditor bank when collected, if the obligation which is the subject of this indenture has not yet been completely satisfied and<br\/><br\/>\"'18. Francisco Reyes y Mijares obligates himself to give account to the creditor bank whenever the latter\u00a0 desires, of the condition\u00a0 of\u00a0 his business\u00a0 affairs, displaying to\u00a0 it the books, documents and other data which may be necessary for the investigation which\u00a0 it desires to\u00a0 make concerning the status and progress of his business affairs in which he grants to\u00a0 the creditor\u00a0 a direct participation and obligates himself to follow its\u00a0 directions.'<br\/><br\/>\"Thereafter, on May 4, 1905, the bank made a\u00a0 further advance of P62,000\u00a0 to Reyes,\u00a0 to\u00a0 secure\u00a0 which the latter executed a pledge\u00a0 (Exhibit B) of certain specified items of personal\u00a0 property, other\u00a0 than the items referred to\u00a0 in Exhibit A.<br\/><br\/>\"Thereafter, on May 12, 1905, to secure the payment of the amount due to plaintiff, Reyes executed a second mortgage and pledge in favor of plaintiff (Exhibit C) upon the same real and\u00a0 personal property described and referred to in Exhibit A.<br\/><br\/>\"All of the properties hereinabove referred to passed into the custody and control of the defendant bank.\u00a0 Portions of the same\u00a0 were disposed of from time\u00a0 to time and the proceeds were\u00a0 credited to\u00a0 the account of Reyes.\u00a0 This account, the sole and\u00a0 only account kept with Reyes\u00a0 by the bank, opened\u00a0 with a debit of the\u00a0 P226,117.38 which was secured by this mortgage.<br\/><br\/>\"The total amount\u00a0 thus credited to this, account of Reyes was P297,418.27, made up as follows:<br\/><br\/><table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" width=\"100%\"> <tbody><tr> <td valign=\"top\" width=\"4%\">(<em>a<\/em>)<\/td> <td valign=\"top\" width=\"84%\"> From the proceeds\u00a0 of a portion of the\u00a0 securities\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 covered\u00a0 by\u00a0 Exhibit A.......................<br\/><\/td> <td valign=\"top\" width=\"12%\">P145,646.15<\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td valign=\"top\">(<em>b<\/em>)<\/td> <td valign=\"top\"> From\u00a0\u00a0 the proceeds\u00a0 of a portion of the\u00a0 securities covered by Exhibit\u00a0\u00a0 B........................<br\/><\/td> <td valign=\"top\">15,098.12<\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td valign=\"top\">(<em>c<\/em>)<\/td> <td valign=\"top\"> From the proceeds of\u00a0\u00a0 properties not\u00a0 hypothecated in Exhibits A or B, <br\/>but subsequently\u00a0\u00a0 pledged to the bank to secure\u00a0 a total of\u00a0 P25,627.25.........................<\/td> <td valign=\"top\"><br\/> P37,739.75<\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td valign=\"top\">(<em>d<\/em>)<\/td> <td valign=\"top\"> An\u00a0\u00a0 erroneous credit\u00a0 counterbalanced by\u00a0 an equal\u00a0\u00a0 debit.............................................<br\/><\/td> <td valign=\"top\"> 2,152.50<\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td valign=\"top\">(<em>e<\/em>)<\/td> <td valign=\"top\">Amounts paid to the bank by Reyes from\u00a0 time to time obtained from\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>assets and\u00a0 credits other than those covered by\u00a0 Exhibits A or\u00a0 B\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>or\u00a0 the special\u00a0 pledges above referred to................................................................<\/td> <td valign=\"top\"><br\/> <br\/> <u>96,781.75<\/u><\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td valign=\"top\">\u00a0<\/td> <td valign=\"top\">\u00a0<\/td> <td valign=\"top\">297,418.27<\/td> <\/tr> <\/tbody><\/table><br\/>\"From time to time the bank cashed checks for Reyes and\u00a0 paid\u00a0 drafts\u00a0 and other obligations in favor of\u00a0 third persons.\u00a0\u00a0 Sometimes these advances were secured by specific pledges of assets, other than\u00a0 those covered\u00a0 by the Exhibits A and\u00a0 B.\u00a0 For the most part, however,\u00a0 these moneys were\u00a0 paid\u00a0 to\u00a0 Reyes or\u00a0 to\u00a0 third\u00a0 persons\u00a0 for his account, without any security whatever.\u00a0\u00a0 (A.

These proceeds amount to P145,646.15.\u00a0 Since the lower\u00a0 court\u00a0 has expressly\u00a0 ruled that the payment of this\u00a0 amount was a satisfaction pro tanto of the mortgage (Exhibit A) and the defendants are prosecuting no exception to this ruling, there is no need to justify the latter by argument and authority.<br\/><br\/>\"<i>(b)<\/i> The second class embraces the excess\u00a0 proceeds\u00a0 of specially pledged property over the amounts secured by such pledges.\u00a0\u00a0 By this is meant that after\u00a0 the execution of the mortgage (Exhibit A) the bank advanced various sums\u00a0 of money to Reyes from time to\u00a0 time and took\u00a0 as security therefor pledges of certain assets of Reyes which were not covered\u00a0 by\u00a0 the mortgage\u00a0 Exhibit A.\u00a0 The total\u00a0 amount thus advanced and secured by these\u00a0 special pledges was P25,627.25.\u00a0\u00a0 The property\u00a0 thus pledged Was subsequently disposed of\u00a0 and the proceeds, paid into the bank, amounted to P37,739.75.\u00a0\u00a0 The excess proceeds of the pledges over the total amount of the advances was thus P12,112.50.\u00a0 This latter amount the lower court applies in pro tanto satisfaction of the\u00a0 mortgage, and\u00a0 for like reasons as before, it is wholly unnecessary to justify this ruling.<br\/><br\/>\"(<i>c<\/i>) The third class embraces the unencumbered residue of Reyes' assets, neither mortgaged nor pledged unto the bank, but paid in from time to time to the aggregate total of P96,781.75.\u00a0 The\u00a0 plaintiff contends that this\u00a0 amount must be legally considered as paid in satisfaction pro\u00a0 tanto of the mortgage debt and\u00a0 appeals from the failure of the lower court\u00a0 so to do.\"<\/blockquote>Counsel then\u00a0 says that the express\u00a0 agreement\u00a0 referred to is found\u00a0 in paragraph 15\u00a0 of the bank's mortgage and pledge, Exhibit A, in which, he\u00a0 asserts, \"the parties stipulated that in addition to the securities therein\u00a0 constituted, the mortgagor obligated all of\u00a0 his property, present and future, to the payment\u00a0 of\u00a0 the mortgage debt,\u00a0 and agreed to pay its proceeds into the bank so long as that mortgage debt, was not\u00a0 wholly\u00a0 liquidated.\"\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 paragraph\u00a0 from which he draws this conclusion\u00a0 reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Don Francisco Reyes y Mijares, in addition to the properties above mentioned\u00a0 as mortgaged and\u00a0 pledged, also charges as security for the payment of said obligation in favor of the bank his other property; present\u00a0 and future, especially those debts which are now due him or which may hereafter become due him, and also the commission to which he is entitled or becomes entitled for the collection of claims against the Spanish Government which have been entrusted to him for collection, which said debts he obligates himself to turn over to the bank upon\u00a0 receiving them, if the debt which is the basis of this obligation has not been fully paid.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In answering this proposition of plaintiff's counsel, these points should be noted:<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 provision just quoted, in so far as it seeks to mortgage or pledge the property mentioned therein, is wholly without force or effect.\u00a0\u00a0 The property sought to be pledged is not described or identified.\u00a0 We do not know, from the terms of the clause or from any other source, that any of it really existed at the time of the execution of the clause. As a pledge or personally it is\u00a0 wholly ineffective, not only for indefiniteness but also for the reason that the property pledged, if any, was not delivered.\u00a0\u00a0 As a mortgage of realty it is equally ineffective for the reason that, to be valid under the provisions of the Civil Code\u00a0 and the Mortgage Law, the mortgage\u00a0 must describe\u00a0 the\u00a0 property mortgaged so that it is clearly identified and identifiable.\u00a0 Sanchez Roman, in his work on the Civil Law\u00a0 (vol. 3, pp. 828, 829) correctly states the law as to mortgages.\u00a0 He says:<br\/><blockquote>\"A logical consequence of the plan of publicity of mortgages is the disappearance from our legal system of <i>general mortgages<\/i>, with the consequent\u00a0 repeal of all laws prescribing and authorizing them;\u00a0 and the\u00a0 stipulation of general mortgage\u00a0 which may hereafter\u00a0 be placed\u00a0 in contracts between private parties will signify nothing, as in fact it has signified nothing since the\u00a0 establishment of the mortgage office (<i>contaduria\u00a0 de hipotecas<\/i>).\u00a0 Even though limited to the property existing at\u00a0 the\u00a0 time, and not, as was\u00a0 usual, extending to the property\u00a0 which might thereafter be acquired,\u00a0 a\u00a0 general\u00a0 mortgage involves lack\u00a0 of publicity in the mortgage,\u00a0 because it\u00a0 can be called public just as soon as it is inscribed in the\u00a0 registro with\u00a0 a detailed statement of the estate affected and\u00a0 of the extent of the guarantee. A <i>definite statement<\/i> of\u00a0 the property mortgaged is an essential element of the <i>publicity. <\/i><br\/><br\/>\"Even aside from this consideration, which is conclusive in the\u00a0 plan adopted, general mortgages would not have gone unabolished, since their very extension renders them invalid.\u00a0 Because of the very fact that they\u00a0 include all the present and future property of the debtor, he has to remain free to\u00a0 alienate it;\u00a0 and if he does alienate all of it, the guarantee disappears, without recourse against the purchaser, thus bringing about actual nullification of the right to the thing, because a mortgage that does not go with the estate, whoever may be its owner, does not deserve the name of mortgage.\"<\/blockquote>This paragraph being entirely ineffective and valueless as a mortgage or pledge, the agreement to pay the proceeds of any portion\u00a0 of the property or credits therein mentioned upon the mortgage debt would be equally ineffective\u00a0 and valueless, as such an agreement is purely subsidiary to the agreement of mortgage and pledge, and is wholly dependent upon it. The latter failing for illegality, or at least, invalidity, the dependent agreement falls with it.\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, even though we are wrong in our assertion that said paragraph 15\u00a0 is wholly futile for the purpose for which it is relied upon by the plaintiff, nevertheless, the stipulation\u00a0 of facts prevents plaintiff from\u00a0 taking the position which\u00a0 counsel takes in this connection.\u00a0\u00a0 Paragraph X of said stipulation reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"That from the 4th day of March, 1905, to the 31st day of December; 1907, the account of the defendant Reyes with the defendant bank has been credited from time to time, as shown\u00a0 by\u00a0 Exhibit D,\u00a0 hereunto attached,\u00a0 with\u00a0\u00a0 various amounts aggregating the sum total of P297,418.27,\u00a0 derived from the following sources, to wit:<br\/><br\/><table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" width=\"100%\"> <tbody><tr> <td valign=\"top\" width=\"8%\">(<em>a<\/em>) <\/td> <td colspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\"><div align=\"justify\">Amounts realized from time to time upon\u00a0 the securities\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 given by <br\/>instrument of\u00a0 March 4, 1905\u00a0 (Exhibit\u00a0\u00a0 A)..................... <\/div><\/td> <td valign=\"top\" width=\"12%\"><br\/>P145,646.15<\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td valign=\"top\">(<em>b<\/em>)<\/td> <td colspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\"> <div align=\"justify\">Amounts realized\u00a0\u00a0 from time to time upon\u00a0 the securities given by\u00a0 <br\/>instrument\u00a0 of\u00a0 May\u00a0\u00a0 4, 1905\u00a0 (Exhibit B)........................\u00a0 <\/div><\/td> <td valign=\"top\"><br\/>P15,098.12<\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td valign=\"top\">(<em>c<\/em>) <\/td> <td colspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\"><div align=\"justify\">Amounts realized from time to time upon\u00a0 additional pledges of\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>merchandise other\u00a0 than those enumerated in <br\/>Exhibits A\u00a0 and\u00a0\u00a0 B........................................... <br\/><br\/>NOTE. - This\u00a0\u00a0 sum of P37,739.75, realized\u00a0 by the bank from special \npledges of\u00a0 merchandise,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 resulted from\u00a0 advances\u00a0 made to Reyes \nupon\u00a0\u00a0 such\u00a0 special pledges\u00a0 as\u00a0\u00a0 follows:\u00a0 <\/div><\/td> <td valign=\"top\"><br\/><br\/>37,739.75<\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\">\u00a0<\/td> <td valign=\"top\"><p align=\"justify\"><br\/> April 13, 1905........................

It imports nothing that\u00a0 Reyes, in his present insolvent indifference, at the dictates of the bank, may voice a preference for the payment of one debtor or the other.\u00a0 The rule of law makes the payment applicable, not to the debt chosen by the debtor, but to that which is the more onerous in fact.\" Counsel's discussion of\u00a0 this point goes,\u00a0 as it\u00a0 necessarily must, upon the assumption that\u00a0 said sum\u00a0 of\u00a0 P96,781.75 was <i>in fact a payment and not a deposit.<\/i>\u00a0\u00a0 That assumption is based on two grounds: One.\u00a0\u00a0 That there was an express agreement that all money\u00a0 from the source whence\u00a0 came said sum should\u00a0 be turned\u00a0 over to the bank as payments. The other.\u00a0 That said sum is\u00a0 found <i>credited to Reyes<\/i> in the<i> only <\/i>account kept by the\u00a0 bank\u00a0 between it and Reyes, and that such credit is an application of said sum to the payment of the debt which, having once been made, can not be\u00a0 recalled.\u00a0 The first ground, as\u00a0 we have\u00a0 already\u00a0 seen, is untenable.\u00a0 There was no such express agreement.\u00a0 The second ground we will discuss\u00a0 along with the proposition whether or not said sum was really a payment at all.<br\/><br\/>We have already twice said\u00a0 that there was no express agreement that the proceeds of all of Reyes' property other than that specifically described in Exhibit A should be applied in payment of the bank's debt.\u00a0\u00a0 Not only is this so, but we may go farther and say that it <i>was not even agreed that all the rents and incomes of the property specifically described in Exhibit A\u00a0 should be so applied.<\/i>\u00a0 It\u00a0 should be remembered that Reyes was to continue in\u00a0 business.\u00a0 The bank distinctly recognized that.\u00a0\u00a0 Paragraph 18 of Exhibit A, translated, provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"18. Don Francisco Reyes y Mijares hereby\u00a0 agrees to render an account to the bank whenever deemed\u00a0 necessary by the latter of all of his business transactions, and to permit the bank\u00a0 to examine the books, documents and other papers which may be necessary in connection with any investigation which the bank may\u00a0 desire to make\u00a0 as to the condition of the business, in which said matters the debtor hereby secures to his\u00a0 creditor a direct intervention, and hereby promises to follow its instructions and suggestions.\"<\/blockquote>It is obvious that Reyes could not run a business without using money to do so.\u00a0 If he were obliged to pay\u00a0 upon said mortgage debt every dollar which came to him, from whatever source, the provision permitting him\u00a0 to continue in business\u00a0 would be farcical.\u00a0\u00a0 A business\u00a0 can not\u00a0 be run if the money received in\u00a0 the\u00a0 course thereof must\u00a0 instantly be withdrawn\u00a0 and paid to the\u00a0 discharge\u00a0 of obligations wholly apart from\u00a0 the business\u00a0 itself.\u00a0 In the\u00a0 meantime he must have\u00a0 something for the\u00a0 support\u00a0 and maintenance of his family.\u00a0\u00a0 To meet this situation, in part, paragraph 13 was inserted in Exhibit A.\u00a0 Translated it reads as follows: <br\/><blockquote>\"13. The total amount of the proceeds of the\u00a0 securities given for the payment of this obligation shall be\u00a0 deposited by Don Francisco Reyes y Mijares in the vaults of the bank, the same to be applied\u00a0 to the payment of this obligation. The debtor likewise agrees to do the same with the proceeds of the rents and dividends accruing to his real estate, securities, credits and shares as they are received by him, reserving\u00a0 to himself,\u00a0 however, only such portions as the parties by\u00a0 mutual agreement may determine to\u00a0 be necessary to meet the expenses of his commercial\u00a0 business and those of his family.\"<\/blockquote>Particular attention is\u00a0 called to the last clause, giving Reyes the right to the rents\u00a0 and income of the property, real and personal, to assist in the conduct of his business and the maintenance of his family and himself, as far as such rents and incomes were sufficient\u00a0 for that purpose. Take this fact in\u00a0 connection\u00a0 with another.\u00a0 It is obvious that Reyes could not continue in business without banking facilities.\u00a0 He must have a bank in which to make deposits and upon which to draw checks and upon which drafts could be drawn.\u00a0 What more natural than to use the bank that had already befriended him?\u00a0 From these facts\u00a0 we can readily see that not every peso delivered to the bank by Reyes was necessarily to be applied to the payment of the mortgage debt, even though said peso came by way of rents and income from the property actually included\u00a0 by specific description in\u00a0 Exhibit A.\u00a0 Moreover, Reyes had a large amount of property not included in the bank's mortgage and pledge. This property was entirely unencumbered and was free to be used by him in his business conducted after the execution of the mortgage and\u00a0 pledge to the bank.\u00a0 It\u00a0 is the admitted evidence in the case that\u00a0 he actually did use substantially all\u00a0 of said property\u00a0 in that way.\u00a0 As a\u00a0 result,\u00a0 such\u00a0 property, converted into cash or used as security, was delivered to the bank to that end.\u00a0 Witness to this fact not only said P96,781.75\u00a0 but also Exhibit\u00a0 B\u00a0 and\u00a0 numerous\u00a0 succeeding pledges.\u00a0\u00a0 Here again we see moneys delivered to the bank which were not necessarily to be applied\u00a0 to the payment of the debt secured by the mortgage and pledge of the\u00a0 bank. Desiring to continue his\u00a0 business, Reyes was\u00a0 confronted with a stern necessity.\u00a0 He must have money to\u00a0 run that business\u00a0 and he must have a\u00a0 bank in which to\u00a0 put it. If every dollar which he could muster and deposit in the bank had to be applied to the payment of an old obligation by the very fact of that deposit, his business was in a sorry plight. The stipulation between him and the bank\u00a0 that he should continue such business\u00a0 would, under such conditions, lose all significance.\u00a0 It is thus clear that it is at least possible that there was some money delivered at different times to the bank which, strictly speaking, was\u00a0 not intended.to be used in reduction of said original debt.\u00a0 It is, as we have seen, conceded that said sum of P96,781.75 is composed of such moneys.<br\/><br\/>At this point, however, we are met with the contention of plaintiff strongly and insistently urged by its counsel, that Reyes and the bank can not be held to have had any other intention with respect to said sum of P96,781.75\u00a0 than to apply\u00a0 it to the payment of said\u00a0 original\u00a0 debt,\u00a0 <i>because it was actually so applied on the books of the bank. <\/i> Meeting this contention it should be noticed:<br\/><ol type=\"1\"><li>That, as\u00a0 we have seen, there was, prior to the delivery of said sum to the bank, no <i>express <\/i>agreement that it was to be applied to said original debt.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>That it nowhere appears that there was any implied agreement to do so.\u00a0 Plaintiff does not assert any such implied\u00a0 agreement.\u00a0\u00a0 Counsel\u00a0 rests his contention\u00a0 upon\u00a0 (<i>a<\/i>) an express agreement to apply, (<i>b<\/i>) application.by operation of law, and (<i>c<\/i>)\u00a0 the fact of actual application on the books of the bank.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>\u00a0That at the\u00a0 time\u00a0 of the delivery of said sum to the bank, the original debt <i>was not yet due.<\/i><br\/><\/li><\/ol>Take this fact\u00a0 in connection with the fact already discussed, that Reyes was to continue in business,\u00a0 that, as a necessary result, he had to have banking facilities, that he must make deposits and draw checks, and that it would be impossible to continue his business if all the money dedicated by him to its continuance had to be paid upon the old obligation, and it is evident that it could not be <i>assumed, presumed or implied<\/i> that\u00a0 moneys so delivered\u00a0 to the bank were <i>intended<\/i> by Reyes to be applied on the old obligation.\u00a0 It is certain that the bank, without the consent of Reyes, had no <i>right<\/i> whatever so to apply them, for the reason that the debt <i>was not yet<\/i> due and the only agreement between the parties as to the application of. money of Reyes delivered by him to the bank related <i>solely<\/i> and exclusively to the proceeds of <i>the sale of the property specifically described in the mortgage and pledge<\/i>, of which said sum of P96,781.75 was concededly no part.\u00a0\u00a0 Reyes was under no legal obligation to pay any part of the indebtedness secured by the mortgage and pledge to the bank until June 4,1905 (clause 10, Exhibit A),<i> unless he sold some of the property described therein.<\/i> In such case the proceeds of the sale must be applied to the payment of the debt.\u00a0 But the bank had absolutely no right, <i>before the debt was due<\/i>, to\u00a0 apply\u00a0 to\u00a0 its\u00a0 payment moneys deposited\u00a0 by Reyes\u00a0 <i>which had been obtained from\u00a0 other sources.<\/i>\u00a0\u00a0 There was no agreement to which Reyes was a party that he should apply <i>all<\/i> of his assets to the payment of the said debt, especially before it was due.\u00a0 He was not obliged to pay any portion of it before it was due. Under the agreement\u00a0 the bank could\u00a0 not\u00a0 oblige Reyes before the debt was due to dispose of any of the property described in the mortgage and pledge of the bank, nor could it do so itself.\u00a0 He had the <i>right<\/i> to dispose of\u00a0 any of said property before the debt was due and apply the proceeds; but he was not <i>obliged to do so.<\/i>\u00a0\u00a0 The bank could foreclose only \"in the event that the\u00a0 debt\u00a0 stated, with the interest thereon, had not been paid at the <i>time<\/i> and to the amount hereinafter to be fixed.\"\u00a0\u00a0 While this clause relates to real estate only, the agreement was the same relative to the personal property. (See par.\u00a0 12, Exhibit A.)\u00a0 By what process of reasoning, then,\u00a0 can the\u00a0 conclusion\u00a0 be justified that said\u00a0 sum\u00a0 of P96,781.75 was applied to the payment of the debt by <i>operation of law<\/i>, particularly when we have in mind the fact that <i>said debt was not yet due?<br\/><\/i><br\/>No more can it be concluded that such application was made with the consent of Reyes.<br\/><br\/>Let\u00a0 us\u00a0 notice the conditions existing\u00a0 at the time\u00a0 the various sums constituting the total\u00a0 of said P96,781.75 were delivered\u00a0 to the bank by Reyes.<br\/><br\/>We\u00a0 have already seen the\u00a0 necessity of\u00a0 Reyes having banking facilities, with\u00a0 the right to deposit and check, as a prerequisite to the conduct of his business.\u00a0\u00a0 We have also seen the impossibility of conducting his business if every deposit in bank was to be applied, perforce, to the payment of the original mortgage debt.\u00a0 It has also been made evident that such application could not have been within the intention of the parties as it would have been entirely at variance with their intentions\u00a0 and purposes when they inserted in the\u00a0 mortgage and\u00a0 pledge paragraph\u00a0 18, already\u00a0 quoted. That instrument must be interpreted as a whole\u00a0 and, if possible,\u00a0 effect given to every part.\u00a0 While a term in a contract may be,\u00a0 in effect, abrogated by the subsequent acts of the\u00a0 parties showing an\u00a0 intention\u00a0 so\u00a0 to do, to accomplish such result such acts must be so\u00a0 inconsistent with the abrogated term as to make such a result necessary.\u00a0\u00a0 The mutual acts of parties are always presumed to be in fulfillment of their express\u00a0 agreements, and not in violation thereof, unless\u00a0 the\u00a0 contrary clearly and necessarily appears.<br\/><br\/>From these observations alone it might be safely assumed that the\u00a0 mere fact\u00a0 of crediting the said sum on Reyes' account on the books of the bank and the consequent apparent reduction of his general indebtedness\u00a0 (of all kinds)\u00a0 to the bank, did not show an intention that said sum should be withdrawn from the uses of his business and dedicated to the payment of a different obligation.<br\/><br\/>But\u00a0 reliance is not\u00a0 placed wholly on those observations. There\u00a0 are\u00a0 other facts\u00a0 and circumstances, even\u00a0 stronger, which\u00a0 show that the parties could not have intended such result.<br\/><br\/>First.\u00a0 During the time that the sums constituting said sum of P96,781.75 were being deposited in the bank, Reyes had\u00a0 drawn checks on\u00a0 the bank and the bank\u00a0 had honored drafts\u00a0 and obligations of Reyes to an amount exceeding P160,000.\u00a0 In other words,\u00a0 during said time Reyes had drawn money from the bank so much faster\u00a0 than he had deposited it that he had not only consumed the said sum of P96,781.75, but\u00a0 had overdrawn\u00a0 his current account\u00a0 more than P50,000.\u00a0 This was the situation on May\u00a0 4th.\u00a0 On that date, probably on the demand of the bank that he make good the overdraft, Reyes executed another pledge to the bank (Exhibit B),\u00a0 the main features of which were: (<i>a<\/i>) Reyes\u00a0 acknowledged that the bank had granted him an amplification amounting to P62,426.21 of the credit given him by the said banking establishment on\u00a0 March 4th last (Exhibit B); (<i>b<\/i>) to secure this sum Reyes pledged to the bank personal property described in said instrument; (<i>c<\/i>) it was\u00a0 agreed that in case the property pledged should not realize a sum sufficient to pay the amount\u00a0 pledged, the property mortgaged and\u00a0 pledged by the\u00a0 instrument of March 4 (Exhibit A) should be held liable to respond for the deficiency, and that the propefty pledged by the present instrument should likewise respond for any deficiency arising under\u00a0 the instrument of March 4; (<i>d)<\/i>\u00a0 the time fixed by the instrument for the payment of said sum\u00a0 was one month, thereby bringing the indebtedness under both pledges due at the\u00a0 same\u00a0 time, June 4,\u00a0 1905.\u00a0 The transactions between Reyes and the bank leading up to the result just noted are significant.\u00a0 From the very beginning deposits were made by Reyes and checks drawn by him against them as a matter of course, as would naturally be\u00a0 expected from the\u00a0 fact that Reyes was continuing his business and the necessities. already noted, which such continuance laid upon him.\u00a0 During all the month of March\u00a0 and until toward the middle of April, the deposits were slightly in excess of the withdrawals.\u00a0 On April 13, two checks were drawn upon the bank by Reye\u00a0 one of P464.15 and another of P9,975.90. On the same day he seems to have been required .to\u00a0 give security by way of pledge\u00a0 in the sum of P2,960.\u00a0 On April 24 Reyes drew on the bank for nearly P30,000, and on the 26th and 29th other withdrawals were made.\u00a0\u00a0 On May 2 and 3 checks were drawn amounting to nearly P40,000.\u00a0 On the 4th of May, as we have seen, the pledge to secure P62,426.21 was required and given.\u00a0 These facts seem\u00a0 to indicate that Reyes\u00a0 and the\u00a0 bank treated the checking account as a thing quite different from the pledge account of P226,117.38. While it is true that the bank permitted Reyes to overdraw his checking account to the extent of more\u00a0 than P130,000, this was undoubtedly done under the\u00a0 belief,\u00a0 clearly\u00a0 well founded, that the\u00a0 pledges which the bank\u00a0 held on the property of\u00a0 Reyes\u00a0 could\u00a0 be continued and extended\u00a0 to secure the payment of said overdraft.<br\/><br\/>Second. In the pledge of May 4 (Exhibit B), given eight days before the execution of the plaintiff's mortgage, it is stated that the sum secured by the pledge was to be credited\u00a0 to Reyes' \"<i>account\u00a0 current<\/i>\u00a0 with the bank.\"\u00a0\u00a0 This phrase, under the circumstances, and\u00a0 particularly in view of the fact\u00a0 that checks\u00a0 were immediately drawn\u00a0 against it, clearly imports a check and deposit account.\u00a0 To give one a credit in a \"current account\" with a bank is to give him a checking credit.\u00a0 No other meaning is possible.\u00a0 That money was\u00a0 delivered\u00a0 to the bank and that checks were drawn against it is unquestioned.\u00a0 That this was repeated almost daily, and frequently many times a day, month after month, for more than two years, is admitted.\u00a0 If this does not make a check and deposit\u00a0 account, nothing can.\u00a0 The method of bookkeeping is not decisive.\u00a0 It does not change the essential nature of the\u00a0 transaction.\u00a0 What the parties actually did and what they understood they\u00a0 were doing is the important thing.\u00a0 The\u00a0 intention of the parties governs. It was clearly not the intention of Reyes, in delivering money to be checked against, that it should go in satisfaction of the original debt.\u00a0\u00a0 If it were so applied, it could not be checked against, as it legally ceased to\u00a0 exist as soon as applied to such payment.\u00a0\u00a0 It borders on the\u00a0 absurd to say that one would deposit money to create a checking account with\u00a0 the intention that\u00a0 said account should be instantly destroyed by the application of\u00a0 the sum deposited\u00a0 to the satisfaction\u00a0 of\u00a0 another\u00a0 obligation.\u00a0 Under\u00a0 such circumstances no check account could possibly be created till the obligation was fully paid.\u00a0 But this would defeat the very object of the deposit.\u00a0 The purpose and intention of Reyes and the bank were to provide means and facilities by which Reyes could continue his business.\u00a0\u00a0 To do this he must have resources, banking facilities, must make deposits and draw checks.\u00a0 But if, by the application of his deposits instantly to the payment of an outside obligation, it was impossible to create a check account, what would he draw against?\u00a0 He could\u00a0 not\u00a0 draw\u00a0 against the original\u00a0 debt, as that was\u00a0 a debt and not\u00a0 a credit.\u00a0 He\u00a0 could not draw\u00a0 against the deposit, as that had been destroyed by its application to the\u00a0 debt.\u00a0 There is nothing which a check can be drawn against except a checking account.\u00a0 That can be created only by actual deposit of money or by a credit extended by the\u00a0 bank.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 account\u00a0 in the\u00a0 present case\u00a0 was created by a combination of both methods.\u00a0 Reyes made deposits and the bank\u00a0 gave him a checking credit by permitting him to overdraw.\u00a0 Certainly Reyes could not ask for more generous treatment; nor could\u00a0 anyone who occupied his shoes then or thereafter.\u00a0 He could not have had the hardihood to ask the bank to credit all\u00a0 his deposits on the secured debt, thereby releasing pro tanto the property mortgaged and pledged to secure that debt, and still permit him to have the\u00a0 same checking\u00a0 credit which\u00a0 he would\u00a0 have had if the deposits had not been\u00a0 so applied.\u00a0\u00a0 Such a\u00a0 method would speedily have transformed the secured debt of the bank into an unsecured one\u00a0 of precisely the same amount.\u00a0 To illustrate:\u00a0 The\u00a0 secured\u00a0 debt\u00a0 was,\u00a0 in\u00a0 round\u00a0 numbers, P226,000.\u00a0 Let us suppose that, during the first week after securing the debt, Reyes had deposited in\u00a0 cash\u00a0 P100,000, and\u00a0 during the second week P126,000, also in cash, said sums being\u00a0 from sources entirely independent of the property mortgaged and pledged to secure the debt.\u00a0 Let us suppose, as plaintiff contends\u00a0 they were,\u00a0 that these two\u00a0 sums had been credited on the secured\u00a0 debt.\u00a0 The debt\u00a0 would have been fully paid and the mortgage and pledge given to secure it fully discharged.\u00a0\u00a0 Suppose, further, that during said two weeks\u00a0 Reyes\u00a0 had drawn checks for P226,000 in the aggregate, which the bank had honored.\u00a0 What would have been the result?\u00a0 By this method, the bank's secured\u00a0 debt, in two short weeks, would have been changed into\u00a0 one\u00a0 entirely unsecured. This is exactly what the\u00a0 plaintiff claims actually happened in the case\u00a0 at bar, substituting the real amounts for the partly fictitious ones given in\u00a0 the illustration.\u00a0 Under this theory the\u00a0 bank would be the worse\u00a0 off\u00a0 the\u00a0 more deposits it received, and Reyes the \"better\u00a0 off the more he overdrew.\u00a0 Every check would be an overdraft.<br\/><br\/>Moreover, that the delivery of said sum of P96,781.75 was not\u00a0 intended\u00a0 as\u00a0 a payment but,\u00a0 rather, as a deposit,\u00a0 is shown by\u00a0 the struggle which\u00a0 Reyes made to maintain a checking account in the bank.\u00a0\u00a0 We have already referred to this.\u00a0 He was almost continuously\u00a0 hard\u00a0 up.\u00a0\u00a0 He was always struggling to get money to pay his current expenses. To meet these he pledged and mortgaged and overdrew,\u00a0 In spite of it\u00a0 all\u00a0 his head was almost continually under water. Under such conditions is it reasonable to say that,\u00a0 after all that struggle and worry, he obtained money to deposit only to\u00a0 have it used to some other purpose?\u00a0 On\u00a0 the\u00a0 other hand, is it\u00a0 a fair interpretation of the situation to conclude that, after\u00a0 all\u00a0 its endeavor to keep Reyes from overdrawing, the bank, nevertheless, not only permitted the very\u00a0 thing it sought to avoid, namely,\u00a0 the overdrafts, but also perpetrated the\u00a0 absurdity of voluntarily exchanging a\u00a0 debt perfectly secured for such overdrafts, entirely unsecured?\u00a0 Is it reasonable\u00a0 to conclude that\u00a0 it was the intention of the bank thus to throw away the very security which it had been at so much\u00a0 pains to secure?\u00a0 Whatever the form in which the books were kept, the parties acted and dealt precisely as if Reyes had not only a secured debt account but also a current account for checking and general\u00a0 banking purposes.\u00a0\u00a0 The sum in dispute here was deposited and wholly drawn out by Reyes, by general banking operations, before June 4,\u00a0 1905, the date on which the mortgage and pledges of the bank, Exhibits A and B, matured. The debt of P226,117.38 not having\u00a0 been due when the\u00a0 P96,781.75\u00a0 was deposited and withdrawn, and there having been no <i>express agreement<\/i> for its application to the payment of said debt, said sum could not have been\u00a0 so\u00a0 applied without the consent of Reyes, express or implied.\u00a0 We do not believe that\u00a0 such consent is shown merely by the method of bookkeeping pursued by the bank, particularly in\u00a0 view\u00a0 of the incessant\u00a0 struggle\u00a0 and endeavor put forth by Reyes to create a check\u00a0 account.\u00a0\u00a0 We do not think such intention is sufficiently shown on the part of the bank, in view of the strikingly pernicious effect that such application would have had upon the interests of the bank itself, namely, the exchange of a debt perfectly secured for one not secured, with no\u00a0 consideration whatever for such exchange.<br\/><br\/>Again, there was no necessity which\u00a0 called for the application of\u00a0 said'sum as a payment on the original debt.\u00a0 It was secured by property worth more than P400,000, according to the value put upon it by the parties themselves.\u00a0\u00a0 This was, so far\u00a0 as appears, sufficient security.\u00a0 There existed, therefore, no\u00a0 particular or pressing reason why the bank should desire payments upon the debt so\u00a0 secured, especially before it was\u00a0 due.\u00a0 This becomes more apparent when we recall, again,\u00a0 the extremely pressing heed\u00a0 of Reyes\u00a0 for money for current uses and the very injurious\u00a0 results to the bank which would\u00a0 result from\u00a0 such\u00a0 application.<br\/><br\/>In most cases the account itself distinguishes between the money delivered to the bank by Reyes for checking purposes and for payment purposes,\u00a0 referring by the latter phrase to money obtained from the sale of some of the mortgaged or pledged property.\u00a0 In the one case it always refers to the money as a\u00a0 deposit, \"<i>ingreso\"<\/i>,\u00a0 and\u00a0 in the others it is\u00a0 generally entered\u00a0 thus: \"Recibido del mismo para amortizar su credito, importe de 78 acciones de la Electricista.\"\u00a0 Or: \"Recibidas\u00a0 para\u00a0 amortizar\u00a0 s.\u00a0 credito medte. entrega del mismo del P.

This,\u00a0 taken\u00a0 in\u00a0 connection with the other effect above set forth, that\u00a0 all of the personal property described in the bank's first pledge (Exhibit A) could be held by said bank\u00a0 under said\u00a0 pledge for the payment not only of the mortgage-pledge debt but also of\u00a0 any other debt contracted by Reyes and due before the mortgage-pledge debt was\u00a0 fully paid,\u00a0 may\u00a0 carry\u00a0 some important consequences in determining how much is\u00a0 due, when taken in connection with the facts\u00a0 now to\u00a0 be stated.\u00a0\u00a0 It should be noted that,\u00a0 from the terms of\u00a0 Exhibit A, primarily,\u00a0 the real estate is charged with the payment of a specified portion\u00a0 of the mortgage-pledge\u00a0 debt,\u00a0 namely, P88,000;\u00a0 and the personal property with \u00a5138,117.38.\u00a0\u00a0 While it is provided in Exhibit A that the real estate shall\u00a0 respond for the deficiency\u00a0 should the\u00a0 personal property not produce P138,117.38, and, vice versa, the\u00a0 personal property shall respond should the real estate not produce P88,000, nevertheless, that can not be required until all of the property dedicated to its particular\u00a0 purpose has been actually\u00a0 put thereto.\u00a0 In\u00a0 other words, the real estate can\u00a0 not be\u00a0 used to pay any part of the P138,117.38 until all of the personal property has been used toward paying that sum.\u00a0 Nor can any portion\u00a0 of the personal property be used to pay\u00a0 any part of the P88,000 until\u00a0 all of the real estate has been applied to such payment.\u00a0\u00a0 It appears from Exhibit E that by far the greater part'of the real estate yet remains unsold and has been in no\u00a0 way applied to the\u00a0 reduction\u00a0 of the P88,000.\u00a0 There has been\u00a0 received from the\u00a0 proceeds of the real estate\u00a0 (and from the income, the amount of which we do not know) only the\u00a0 sum of P19,070.23.\u00a0\u00a0 It is manifest, therefore,\u00a0 that\u00a0 no part Of the personal\u00a0 property or the income\u00a0 therefrom,\u00a0 if any, could have been applied to relieve the real\u00a0 estate from its share of the\u00a0 burden of the debt\u00a0 during the time\u00a0 included within the\u00a0 scope of\u00a0 this action.\u00a0 On\u00a0 the\u00a0 other\u00a0 hand, a considerable part of\u00a0 the charge\u00a0 imposed upon the\u00a0 personal property still remains unpaid, a portion of said\u00a0 property still\u00a0 remaining in the hands of the bank\u00a0 unsold and unused for the reduction of said debt.\u00a0 There has been realized from the\u00a0 personal property the sum of P126,575.92.\u00a0 Its share of the burden\u00a0 was P138,117.38.\u00a0 With interest added, there would remain a considerable balance\u00a0 due from the\u00a0 personal property.<br\/><br\/>These facts are important for the reason\u00a0 that inasmuch as plaintiff's Exhibit C touches by\u00a0 way of lien nothing but the real estate,\u00a0 it is\u00a0 evident that its mortgage is effective as a lien only to the extent, at the very\u00a0 utmost, to which the real estate has been relieved of its burden of P88,000.<br\/><br\/>We are of the opinion that,\u00a0 from every point of view, regarding the\u00a0 case from\u00a0 the\u00a0 standpoint of its separate elements and as a whole, it is clear\u00a0 that the intention of the parties, Reyes and the bank, was that the said sum of P96,781.75 should be considered as a deposit instead of a payment, and we so hold.\u00a0 No prejudice\u00a0 to the plaintiff having been shown as a result of the carrying out of such intention, there is no need of further discussion.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 judgment\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 court\u00a0 below is affirmed, without special finding as to costs.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i> Torres, Johnson, Carson,<\/i> and <i>Trent, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><\/div>",

In this action\u00a0 (case No.\u00a0 305) the defendant, Juan Climaco, made no appearance.<\/p><p>After hearing the evidence adduced during the trial, in cause\u00a0 No. 305 the lower court rendered\u00a0 a judgment decreeing that the sentence dictated\u00a0 by the justice of the peace, in the case of Tan\u00a0 Banjua vs.\u00a0 Manuel Cheong Tique was null and void and\u00a0 that the execution\u00a0 issued thereon,\u00a0 on the 25th of March,\u00a0 1905, was\u00a0 also null and void; and the court issued an order restraining the sheriff, Juan Climaco, and his deputies, from executing the said execution.<\/p><p>It was stipulated by the plaintiff and the defendants that Exhibit A, attached to the answer\u00a0 of the defendant, Juan Climaco, correctly stated the facts relating to the execution and sale of the logs in question, as well as the return of the sheriff made in relation\u00a0 to the said sale.<\/p><p>From the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause the following facts were fully proven and are not disputed:<\/p><p>First.\u00a0 That\u00a0 the\u00a0 auxiliary\u00a0 justice of the\u00a0 peace of the municipality of Cebu, on the\u00a0 14th\u00a0 of March, 1905, in\u00a0 an action then\u00a0 pending between.

In the action (305)\u00a0 the court not\u00a0 only declared that the judgment\u00a0 of\u00a0 the justice of the peace\u00a0 in the case of Tan Bunjua <em>vs<\/em>. Manuel\u00a0 Cheong Tique was null\u00a0 and void, but also\u00a0 declared that the execution issued thereon was null and void.<\/p><p>From\u00a0 the foregoing facts we have the following conclusions :<\/p><p>That\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant\u00a0 herein, Juan Climaco, as sheriff of the Province of Cebu,\u00a0 by virtue of authority of a writ of execution which was declared to be null\u00a0 and void,\u00a0 issued upon a judgment of the justice of the peace, which has also been declared null\u00a0 and void, levied upon property of the plaintiff, Nicolas Arbotante, and sold the same\u00a0 without his (Arbotante's) having had any notice whatever of said execution and sale.<\/p><p>With\u00a0 reference to the first above assignment of error, the\u00a0 plaintiff proved beyond any peradventure of\u00a0 doubt that the said sixty-five logs belonged to him.\u00a0 The defendant presented no proof whatever even tending to show that the logs were not the property of the plaintiff.<\/p><p>Under the\u00a0 second assignment\u00a0 of error, the appellant attempts to\u00a0 show that\u00a0 by reason of the fact that he levied upon the logs in question and sold them under an execution issued by the justice of the peace,\u00a0 that he was acting in a judicial capacity.\u00a0 This\u00a0 contention can not be admitted, but even if\u00a0 it were admitted, even then it would\u00a0 not be authority for the sheriff\u00a0 to sell\u00a0 the\u00a0 property\u00a0 of\u00a0 a third person.\u00a0 The execution\u00a0 commanded the\u00a0 sheriff to attach sufficient personal property belonging to\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant, Manuel Cheong Tique, to satisfy said judgment. The execution afforded the defendant\u00a0 (the sheriff)\u00a0 no authority whatever to attach the property of another person,\u00a0 and when he attached the property of a third person, he violated the provisions of his order (the execution).\u00a0\u00a0 The execution only afforded him protection when he complied with its terms, to wit,\u00a0 to levy\u00a0 upon the\u00a0 property\u00a0 of the\u00a0 persons mentioned therein.<\/p><p>With reference to the\u00a0 third assignment of\u00a0 error,\u00a0 the defendant and\u00a0 appellant contends that his\u00a0 acts in\u00a0 levying upon and selling the logs in question were legal and valid. This\u00a0 contention\u00a0 certainly\u00a0 can not be\u00a0 maintained.\u00a0 The plaintiff herein, the owner of the logs\u00a0 in question, had had no\u00a0 hearing whatever with reference to the said sale.\u00a0\u00a0 He had no notice of the execution\u00a0 and sale.\u00a0\u00a0 He was deprived of his property without due process of law.<\/p><p>Under the\u00a0 fourth assignment of error, the defendant and appellant (the sheriff) contends that inasmuch as the\u00a0 execution\u00a0 was levied\u00a0 upon\u00a0 the logs in question, and the same were sold by him in good faith, he should be relieved from all responsibility;\u00a0 in other words, the effect of the\u00a0 contention of the defendant and appellant (the sheriff)\u00a0 is\u00a0 that under a writ of execution issued by the court he may\u00a0 levy upon the property of any\u00a0 person\u00a0 whatsoever, and sell the same, without incurring any responsibility, so long as he acts in good faith.\u00a0 The lack of good faith is a fact difficult to prove.\u00a0 The execution was issued to the sheriff\u00a0 and he was directed\u00a0 to levy upon\u00a0 the property of Manuel Cheong Tique.\u00a0\u00a0 He did\u00a0 not obey that order.\u00a0 Instead\u00a0 of levying upon the property of Manuel Cheong Tique, he levied upon and sold the property of\u00a0 Nicolas Arbotante.\u00a0 To\u00a0 sustain the\u00a0 good faith which he claims he exercised in said\u00a0 execution and sale he made no effort to show that he had made the slightest inquiry of the people living in and about the place where the\u00a0 logs were deposited, for the purpose of ascertaining who the real owner of the logs was.\u00a0 Certainly a sheriff in the execution of a\u00a0 writ of execution can claim no protection under said\u00a0 writ\u00a0 of execution,\u00a0 unless he can show that he obeyed its\u00a0 orders.\u00a0 In the\u00a0 present case he makes no pretense of having obeyed the writ of execution.<\/p><p>An execution is an order to the sheriff to attach and sell the property of the judgment debtor.\u00a0 If he sells the property of another he is not obeying the\u00a0 order of the court.<\/p><p>The officer\u00a0 has no authority to attach\u00a0 the property of any person except that of the defendant\u00a0 (judgment debtor). If he does so the writ affords him no justification, for the act is not in obedience\u00a0 to its\u00a0 mandate.\u00a0\u00a0 (Rhodes\u00a0 <em>vs<\/em>.

Harper, 32 Miss., 112; Gimble <em>vs<\/em>. Acklex, 12 Iowa, 27.)<\/p><p>In the case of Forsythe <em>vs.<\/em> Ellis (4 J. J. Marshall\u00a0 (Ky.), 298)\u00a0 the chief justice, speaking for the court, said:<\/p><p>\"The reason why the sheriff is responsible to the owner is a very comprehensive one and applies to all persons who take the property\u00a0 of others\u00a0 without any\u00a0 authority.\u00a0 An execution against the goods of A gives no authority to the sheriff to take the goods of B.\u00a0 So long as the officer confines his acts to the authority\u00a0 of the process he is irresponsible, but all acts which are not justified by the writ are, of course, without\u00a0 authority\u00a0 of law.\u00a0 The inevitable consequence, therefore, of the principle that no man shall touch the property of another without the permission of the owner or the sanction\u00a0 of\u00a0 the law, is that no\u00a0 plea of\u00a0 exemption or station, however exalted or consecrated, can exonerate a trespasser.\u00a0 This\u00a0 principle\u00a0 is conservative of property. Without its\u00a0 integrity and universality, private rights would be insecure\u00a0 and the law would be unequal and tyrannical. The sovereign power of the State, with its 'eminent domain' can not take\u00a0 from the humblest citizen a particle of his property for public\u00a0 use, without allowing him a just compensation.<\/p><blockquote><p>\"If an execution against one man would excuse\u00a0 the sheriff for taking and selling the property of another, every citizen would be at his mercy and none could\u00a0 call his\u00a0 estate his own.\u00a0\u00a0 As the execution gives the sheriff no authority,\u00a0 he has none, and\u00a0 therefore his sale neither devises nor confers any rights.\u00a0 The owner of the property, therefore, sold\u00a0 by the sheriff without authority,\u00a0 may recover from the sheriff its value in\u00a0 an action of trespass.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Mr. Harlow, in\u00a0 his work on the liability of sheriffs,\u00a0 at section 562, says:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"An officer\u00a0 is liable to the owner of personal property for the seizure and sale thereof under an execution against a third party, and he is not relieved from liability by professing\u00a0 to sell only the 'right, title and interest' of the defendant.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>In the case\u00a0 of Boulware <em>vs<\/em>. Craddock (30 Cal., 190) the court said:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"If the sheriff, by virtue of\u00a0 an execution, seizes the property\u00a0 of a person other than the judgment debtor, whether by mistake or design, it is not necessary for the owner of the property thus seized to make a demand on the sheriff before commencing suit.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The defense is made for the defendant here (he does not make it for himself)\u00a0 that under section\u00a0 451 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions,\u00a0 he is not liable, even\u00a0 though he levies upon and sells the property of a third person, unless such third person should give him notice in writing and lay claim to the property which is being sold.\u00a0 We can not agree that said\u00a0 section 451\u00a0 is subject to any such interpretation. We do not believe that section 451 was intended to\u00a0 protect a sheriff\u00a0 from all responsibility\u00a0 whatever where he sells the property of a third\u00a0 person under a writ of execution, where such third person fails to give him notice that the property being sold belongs to him.\u00a0 If that is the\u00a0 correct interpretation of said section 451, then we contend that that provision\u00a0 of said section is absolutely void under the provisions of the Philippine Bill, which provides that persons shall not be deprived\u00a0 of their property without due process of law.\u00a0 It being admitted in the present case that the property belonged to Nicolas Arbotante and that it was sold without his knowledge or consent, or without the slightest notice that the same was being\u00a0 levied upon and sold, <em>we hold,\u00a0 that to justify the sheriff in said\u00a0 sale and to relieve him from all responsibility whatever, would constitute one of the most flagrant cases of depriving a man of his property without due process\u00a0 of law\u00a0 which could possibly come to the attention of the court.<\/em><\/p><p>The defendant and\u00a0 appellant makes no claim that section 451 of the Code of Procedure in\u00a0 Civil Actions relieves him of all responsibility.\u00a0\u00a0 The defense is made for him.<\/p><p>Section\u00a0 451 is taken from\u00a0 section 689 of the\u00a0 California Code.\u00a0 So far as we have been able to discover the supreme court of California has not interpreted said section (689). In ttie case of Black <em>vs.<\/em> Clasby (97 Cal., 482) the supreme court of California referred to said section (689) but refused to discuss the effect of the same, for the reason that the action in that case arose prior to the time of the enactment of said provision.\u00a0\u00a0 In that case, as they had done in many others, the supreme court of California said:<\/p><p>\"When the sheriff, under a writ of attachment,\u00a0 or of execution\u00a0 against one\u00a0 person,\u00a0 seizes\u00a0 the\u00a0 goods of\u00a0 another, which at the time of the seizure are in the custody\u00a0 either of the owner, or of a person other than the defendant in the writ, he is a trespasser ab initio% and no previous demand is necessary to authorize the recovery therefor.\"<\/p><p>In the case of Lammon <em>vs<\/em>.

Other defendants answered, alleging that all of the property of Celedonio Cosio had been\u00a0 divided among his heirs\u00a0 soon after his death, which occurred\u00a0 in\u00a0 1866.<\/p><p>On the 25th of November, 1908, the plaintiff presented an amended complaint including Ruperto Salva, Juana Salva, Silvestre Gregorio and Constancia Calacas, as plaintiffs, and Antonio Cosio and Jesus Cosio,\u00a0 as additional defendants, alleging that they were all heirs of the\u00a0 said Celedonio Cosio, and asked for a partition of six parcels of land which were particularly described in paragraph\u00a0 one of the said amended complaint.<\/p><p>Upon\u00a0 the\u00a0 19th of January,\u00a0 1909, Mr.\u00a0 Crispin\u00a0 Oben, attorney for the nine defendants, filed an amended answer, in which he alleged that all of the lands in question had been divided\u00a0 among the heirs of Celedonio Cosio, deceased, at the time of his death, and\u00a0 prayed that the\u00a0 defendants be\u00a0 absolved from any liability under the complaint presented in said\u00a0 cause.<\/p><p>After hearing the evidence adduced during\u00a0 the trial of the cause, the Hon. Vicente Jocson, judge, found that the lands in question had been divided\u00a0 in\u00a0 accordance\u00a0 with\u00a0 the contention\u00a0 of\u00a0 the defendants and absolved\u00a0 them from any liability under the complaint, with costs against the plaintiff.<\/p><p>From that judgment the plaintiff\u00a0 appealed and made two assignments of\u00a0 error in this court.<\/p><p>The plaintiff and\u00a0 appellant\u00a0 in\u00a0 his\u00a0 brief in this court admitted\u00a0 that\u00a0 at\u00a0 the time\u00a0 of the\u00a0 death of the said Celedonio Cosio in 1866, or soon thereafter, his property\u00a0 had been divided among his heirs.\u00a0\u00a0 (See brief of appellant, pp. 3 and 5).\u00a0 There\u00a0 was an attempt made to show that some of the heirs of Celedonio Cosio, or at least one of the said heirs, at the time said partition\u00a0 of the property in question was made, was a minor and that, therefore, said partition was illegal.\u00a0 Even\u00a0 granting that\u00a0 one of the heirs was a minor at the time said partition\u00a0 took place, that minor is the\u00a0 only person who can avail\u00a0 himself\u00a0 of\u00a0 the right to have said partition declared illegal.\u00a0 It is not\u00a0 alleged that the ancestors\u00a0 of the present plaintiff were minors at\u00a0 the time said\u00a0 partition was\u00a0 made.<\/p><p>There was also an attempt made\u00a0 during the trial of the cause to show that some of the\u00a0 persons who shared in the partition\u00a0 of the property of Celedonio\u00a0 Cosio in 1866 were natural children and had never been\u00a0 legitimized.\u00a0 That contention may or may not be\u00a0 true.\u00a0 It is\u00a0 true, however, that all of the\u00a0 persons who shared in the partition of the estate, were treated as brothers and sisters, children of the said Celedonio Cosio.\u00a0\u00a0 It is\u00a0 also shown that the heirs\u00a0 at\u00a0 the time of the partition of the said estate in\u00a0 1866, took possession of their respective shares and\u00a0 that they and their descendants have\u00a0 been\u00a0 in\u00a0 possession\u00a0 thereof\u00a0 ever since. This action was commenced in\u00a0 1906.\u00a0\u00a0 It seems to\u00a0 us that after\u00a0 the\u00a0 expiration of forty years it is\u00a0 pretty late\u00a0 for common heirs to ask for the partition\u00a0 of an estate, which they themselves admit was\u00a0 divided\u00a0 among the heirs, upon the ground that at the time the partition took place some of them\u00a0 were either minors or were\u00a0 illegitimate, especially when no complaint is made by such minor or his descendants.

Ignacio Villamor, it was said that \"The\u00a0 proofs\u00a0 presented by\u00a0 the plaintiff during the trial of the cause demonstrate that the property belongs to the estate of the deceased Tomas Cosio, having been inherited from his deceased father,\" etc. This action was\u00a0 known as cause No. 420 in the Court of First Instance of the Province of Laguna.\u00a0 It was commenced on the 13th of November, 1905.<\/p><p>The defendants also presented Exhibit 3, in support of their contention that the property of Celedonio Cosio had been\u00a0 divided among his\u00a0 heirs.\u00a0 (Record, pp. 35-37.)\u00a0 By reference to this exhibit, it will be seen that on the 9th day of August, 1905, Maria\u00a0 Cosio presented a petition in\u00a0 the Court of First Instance of the Province of\u00a0 Laguna for the appointment of\u00a0 an administrator of the estate of Tomas Cosio.\u00a0 In said petition\u00a0 Maria Cosio alleged that the said Tomas Cosio died intestate; that at the time of his death he was possessed of three parcels of land and certain carabaos; that the said lands had been acquired by him by inheritance from his deceased father, Celedonio Cosio, thus indicating that there\u00a0 had been a partition of the property of the said Celedonio Cosio.\u00a0\u00a0 The said Maria Cosio was a daughter\u00a0 of Celedonio Cosio and a sister of the said Tomas Cosio.<\/p><p>By reference to Exhibit No. 2 (pp. 30-34) it will be seen from the\u00a0 inventory presented by the administrator of\u00a0 the estate of Tomas Cosio, that the lands included therein constituted some of the lands described in the amended petition of the plaintiff herein.\u00a0 (See bill of exceptions, pp. 26, 27.) (See decision of this court in the case of Cosio <em>vs.<\/em> Pili,\u00a0 (10 Phil. Rep., 72) for facts confirmatory of some of the facts contained in the foregoing exhibits.)<\/p><p>The said Maria Cosio,\u00a0 mentioned in exhibit 3 above, who alleged that the property described in said exhibit had been inherited\u00a0 by Tomas Cosio from his father Celedonio Cosio, was the mother of the\u00a0 plaintiff and appellant herein.\u00a0\u00a0 (Brief of appellee, p. 4.)\u00a0\u00a0 The declarations of Maria Cosio in said petition (Exhibit 3) by reason of the fact that she was\u00a0 the daughter\u00a0 of Celedonio Cosio,\u00a0 should be given some credit. There seems to\u00a0 have\u00a0 been\u00a0 no reason for making a false declaration in said exhibit.<\/p><p>The lower court, in\u00a0 its decision, among other things\/made the following statements\u00a0 which we believe are supported by the proof:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"(1)\u00a0 The plaintiff has adduced\u00a0 evidence attempting\u00a0 to prove that the property specified in her amended complaint belonged to\u00a0 the deceased Celedonio Cosio,\u00a0 successor in interest of the herein\u00a0 plaintiff and defendants,\u00a0 but\u00a0 this evidence is merely oral\u00a0 testimony, not so sufficiently clear that the court can decide\u00a0 whether it really was\u00a0 not partitioned; because the witnesses themselves have been unable to specify in a clear\u00a0 way the location of this\u00a0 property, in whose possession it is, and the nature of it; but weighing this evidence all\u00a0 together I am inclined to\u00a0 believe that of the property now claimed part is\u00a0 in the possession of persons who have not been made parties to\u00a0 this suit and part is\u00a0 in the possession\u00a0 of Elena Cosio.<\/p><p>\"(2) It appears, moreover, by defendant's Exhibit No.\u00a0 3, that it was Maria Cosio, mother of one of the present plaintiffs in this\u00a0 suit,\u00a0 Irene, who really requested\u00a0 the\u00a0 appointment\u00a0 of an\u00a0 administrator for the\u00a0 deceased Tomas\u00a0 Cosio, and that according to said request all the property owned by Tomas Cosio at his death, among which\u00a0 that now\u00a0 in litigation is\u00a0 included,\u00a0 belonged\u00a0 to\u00a0 said Tomas Cosio\u00a0 by inheritance from his father, Celedonio Cosio (Exhibit No. 3 of the defendants).<\/p><p>\"(3) The action taken by Maria Cosio when\u00a0 alive conclusively demonstrates the bad faith\u00a0 of Irene Gregorio,\u00a0 and the latter can not impugn the action taken by\u00a0 her deceased mother, which constitutes a recognition of the ownership of the property\u00a0 of Tomas Cosio that has passed on to his heirs.<\/p><p>\"Summing up, then, the plaintiffs' evidence: they have not substantiated their averment that the property they claim was Celedonio\u00a0 Cosio's and that it is still <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">pro indiviso,<\/span> for some of this\u00a0 property is in the possession of other persons and can\u00a0 hardly be recovered when these persons have not even been sued\u00a0 for it.<\/p><p>\"Nor have\u00a0 the plaintiffs succeeded in showing clearly the degrees of relationship of all the defendants, for their testimony in this\u00a0 respect is ambiguous and incomplete, just as it is with\u00a0 reference to the property they say was Celedonio Cosio's, all\u00a0 which argues against the credibility of these witnesses for the plaintiffs.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>After a careful\u00a0 re examination of the facts, with special reference to the allegations made in the motion for a rehearing,\u00a0 we are still of the opinion that the judgment of the lower court should be affirmed, and\u00a0 that the motion for a rehearing should be denied.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<\/p><p><em>Mapa, Carson, Moreland,<\/em> and <em>Trent, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<\/p><\/div>",

Hashim, for his credit of P385.19; (4) Riu Hermanos, for a credit of which the amount, consideration and judgment of execution do not appear in the record; (5)\u00a0 Erlanger &amp; Galinger, for a credit of P2,107.97; and (6)\u00a0 Ruiz y Rementeria, for two credits,\u00a0 one of P572.91 and the other of P304.73.<br\/><br\/>The trial court ordered the payment\u00a0 of the credits, in the order as\u00a0 above enumerated, up to the fourth, and accorded to the owner of the fifth the right to collect the rest after the preceding ones should have been paid.\u00a0 He disallowed the two credits of Ruiz y\u00a0 Rementeria, given the sixth place.<br\/><br\/>Issue was taken by the attorneys of Erlanger &amp; Galinger and Riu Hermanos on the\u00a0 one hand, and counsel for Ruiz y Rementeria, on the other, the evidence\u00a0 discussed relating to the two credits of Ruiz y Rementeria, the two judgments rendered by the justice of the peace court of Manila, and the testimony of the witness Bruno Rementeria.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the two judgments of the justice of the peace court of Manila, it was found in the judgment of the trial court that they were for two amounts contained in a single account, the total value of which; P877.74, exr ceeded that for which\u00a0 the\u00a0 justice of the peace court had jurisdiction, and that, therefore, those judgments were null and void for lack of jurisdiction of the court that pronounced them.\u00a0 As\u00a0 a result, writ of execution could not issue, nor could the accounts be paid.<br\/><br\/>Ruiz y Rementeria appealed from\u00a0 that judgment.<br\/><br\/>The testimony of Bruno Rementeria discloses that Abraham ordered goods from him, payable at two months; that the\u00a0 first\u00a0 bill, amounting to P882.84, was\u00a0 partly paid by Abraham by a draft for P300; adding to this a\u00a0 discount of P9.93, and crediting it to his account, there remained a balance of\u00a0 P572.91;\u00a0 that subsequently\u00a0 other goods\u00a0 were taken, included in\u00a0 another bill amounting to\u00a0 P304.73, which also was unpaid; and that the debtor\u00a0 was to make the payments in\u00a0 accordance with the bills.<br\/><br\/>A single\u00a0 account is not a single debt.\u00a0 Usually there is but\u00a0 a single\u00a0 account between a creditor\u00a0 and\u00a0 a debtor; nevertheless, in a\u00a0 single account\u00a0 between, a creditor and a debtor there may\u00a0 be various and distinct items calling for payment\u00a0 on different dates, and there is\u00a0 no reason why payment for the items\u00a0 overdue should be postponed\u00a0 until the\u00a0 period\u00a0 for the settlement\u00a0 of the account shall\u00a0 have expired.\u00a0 It was proved at\u00a0 the trial,\u00a0 and there is nothing to offset this proof, that the items\u00a0 for the goods taken by the debtor were payable at\u00a0 two months'\u00a0 time and were to be paid bill by bill, and that one bill was for P882.84, and the other for P304.73.\u00a0\u00a0 This being so, if\u00a0 one bill was\u00a0 a credit with\u00a0 fixed time of payment,\u00a0 distinct from the other bill, also with fixed time of payment; and on the hypothesis that the maturity\u00a0 of a credit renders\u00a0 its\u00a0 payment demand- able, inasmuch as\u00a0 it contains in itself a cause of action, it follows that each matured debt gives the right to an action; therefore, a debtor, much less a third person, may not\u00a0 avail himself of the defense of lack of jurisdiction on the ground that the sum of two credits exceeds the amount which may be sued for in a justice of the peace court.<br\/><br\/>When the debt is a single one, it is obvious that the creditor may not, to suit himself, divide it, in order to obtain a brief trial before the justice of the peace court, especially when by so doing, prejudice may be caused to other creditors by\u00a0 reason of priority of date; but the debt\u00a0 in the present\u00a0 case\u00a0 is not a\u00a0 single\u00a0 one,\u00a0 as\u00a0 shown by the unimpeached\u00a0 evidence\u00a0 presented at the trial.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is\u00a0 reversed, in so far as it disallows the claim and writ of execution of Ruiz y Rementeria, and the sheriff of Tayabas is ordered not\u00a0 to pay the said claim,\u00a0 which must be paid\u00a0 in order as of the fourth, after payment shall have been made of the credit held by N. T. Hashim &amp; Co.\u00a0\u00a0 No special finding is made with respect to the costs of this instance.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Mapa,<\/i> and <i>Johnson,\u00a0 JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><br\/><i>Moreland, J<\/i>., concurs in the dispositive part.<br\/><\/div>",

Herbert D. Gale presiding, convicting them of the crime of murder and sentencing them each td death.<br\/><br\/>From the proofs presented by the Government, it appears that the appellants,\u00a0 with nine others, being members of the second company\u00a0 of the Constabulary stationed\u00a0 at Davao, mutinied on the 6th day of June, 1909, attempting, during the course of such mutiny, to\u00a0 kill one of their\u00a0 superior officers, Lieutenant Goicuria; that\u00a0 immediately\u00a0 after\u00a0 such revolt the mutineers,\u00a0 having taken arms and\u00a0 ammunition from the depositary, left the vicinity of Davao and marched toward the mountains of Lipada; that on the 8th day\u00a0 of June, 1909, said mutineers returned to Davao for the purpose of attacking the town; that the inhabitants thereof, having received previous notice of the proposed attack, prepared themselves to meet it; that J. L. Burchfield, P.\u00a0 C. Libby, A. M. Templeton, and Roy Libby, armed with rifles, having been detailed by those commanding the defense of the town, on the\u00a0 afternoon of the day referred to, advanced to the cemetery within the limits of the town, forming an outpost for the purpose of awaiting the coming of\u00a0 the mutineers; that about 4.15 o'clock they\u00a0 sighted the mutineers; that immediately thereafter they heard a shot, followed by others, which came from near the\u00a0 cemetery, where the mutineers had halted and dismounted;\u00a0 that after a few shots had been exchanged Roy Libby was struck with a ball and killed; that the outpost retreated to the convent and took refuge therein ; that the mutineers advanced against the town, attacking it at various points and especially the convent, where a portion of the residents of the town\u00a0 had gathered, including the women\u00a0 and children:, for the\u00a0 purpose of defending themselves; that no other person except\u00a0 Roy Libby was killed, although several others were more or less severely wounded.<br\/><br\/>What with the confession of some of the accused, the testimony of others, and the evidence presented by the witnesses for the prosecution, there remains so little a question of fact in this case that it is substantially unworthy of discussion. That\u00a0 the appellants\u00a0 with\u00a0 others revolted\u00a0 against their superior officers on the 6th\u00a0 of June; that they returned to Davao on the 8th and attacked it viciously and persistently, killing one of its defenders and wounding several others; and that they all took a direct and active part therein, is not only absolutely undoubted from the testimony of the prosecution but is substantially admitted by all of the defendants in the case.\u00a0 Some of the appellants\u00a0 sought to defend themselves upon the ground that they had been forced, by threats and intimidation, to take part in\u00a0 the mutiny and the attack upon Davao by other members of the mutineer band.\u00a0 The evidence in no way justifies this defense and it is utterly impossible under any construction of the evidence to sustain it.\u00a0 All of the appellants, however, agree in presenting the defense that they entered the town of Davao on the 8th of June, not for the purpose of attacking it but for the purpose of surrendering to their superior officers and the governor of the district.\u00a0 Not only is it impossible from the testimony of the prosecution to arrive at such a conclusion of fact, but it is almost as nearly impossible to\u00a0 arrive at such a conclusion from the evidence presented by the appellants themselves.\u00a0 No\u00a0 defense upon the facts worthy of the name has been presented.<br\/><br\/>As to\u00a0 whether or not there\u00a0 was present <i>premeditacion conocida,<\/i> qualifying the crime as murder, a simple reading of the proofs presented by the\u00a0 Government is sufficient to demonstrate that beyond question or\u00a0 doubt.\u00a0 It appears that all of the appellants, on or about the 8th day of June, at about 11 o'clock in the\u00a0 forenoon,\u00a0 went to the house of Genon Rasay, some distance from Davao, in order to obtain information as to whether\u00a0 or not reinforcements had\u00a0 been landed at Davao.\u00a0 On being informed that, to the knowledge of the persons questioned, none had been landed, they asked the elder Rasay to\u00a0 permit them to leave at his house the three women that accompanied them, as they were going to march on Davao\u00a0 and attack it.\u00a0 The appellant\u00a0 Rodriguez also requested that, in case he should be killed in the attack, he, Rasay, should\u00a0 treat one of the women, who was the wife of Rodriguez, as his servant.\u00a0 Having left the women in the house of Cenon,\u00a0 they took up\u00a0 the march\u00a0 to Davao.\u00a0 On arriving\u00a0 near\u00a0 the river Bagoo, they were overtaken by Ignacio Rasay,\u00a0 a kinsman of Cenon Rasay, and suspecting that he was\u00a0 going to Davao for the purpose of warning the town; against the meditated attack, they halted him and told him that, if he should give any warning of their approach, they would cause damage to his family.\u00a0 He having assured them that such was not his purpose, they permitted him to proceed.\u00a0 The appellants continued on their way and arriving at the cemetery near Davao heard a shot, which they claim came from those who had been sent out to watch for their approach.\u00a0\u00a0 On seeing this advance guard, the accused dismounted from their horses and\u00a0 began to fire forming in a skirmish line and advancing steadily.\u00a0 Overwhelmed by the number of the attacking party, the outpost retreated toward the village, pursued by\u00a0 the appellants.\u00a0 There followed an attack upon the town, more or less general, of the kind and\u00a0 character generally to be expected from such a body of men.\u00a0\u00a0 The attack\u00a0 was,\u00a0 in a large measure, unsuccessful\u00a0 and the mutineers\u00a0 withdrew when\u00a0 they\u00a0 saw\u00a0 the futility of further fighting.<br\/><br\/>The learned trial court found <i>premeditation conocida<\/i> as\u00a0 the element qualifying the crime as murder.\u00a0 The learned counsel for the appellants excepts to this finding and asserts that, inasmuch as the appellants did not know even of\u00a0 the existence\u00a0 of the\u00a0 deceased, Roy\u00a0 Libby,\u00a0 at the time of his death, much less that he was at the time in the village they attacked and one of the outpost of four, his death could not possibly have been premeditated.\u00a0 He argues that, in order that the killing be premeditated, the accused must have resolved to kill a predetermined person.\u00a0 We do not stop to discuss this question\u00a0 at length for the reason that it has already been\u00a0 determined\u00a0 by\u00a0 this court adversely to\u00a0 the learned counsel's contention.\u00a0 In the case\u00a0 of the United States vs. The Moro Manalinde, \"the accused made up\u00a0 his mind to kill two\u00a0 undetermined persons,\u00a0 the first\u00a0 whom he should, meet on the way, in compliance with the inducement of a third person.\"\u00a0 In its decision the court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"As to the other circumstance it is also unquestionable that the accused upon accepting the order and undertaking the journey in\u00a0 order to\u00a0 comply\u00a0 therewith, deliberately considered and carefully and thoughtfully meditated over the nature and the consequences of the acts which, under orders received from the said Datto, he was about to carry out, and to that\u00a0 end provided himself with a weapon,\u00a0 concealing it by wrapping it up, and started on a journey of a day and a night for the sole purpose\u00a0 of taking the life of two unfortunate persons whom he did not know, and with whom he had never had any trouble; nor did there exist any reason which, to a certain extent, might warrant his perverse deed. The fact that the arrangement between the instigator and the\u00a0 tool considered\u00a0 the\u00a0 killing of unknown\u00a0 persons, the first encountered, does not bar the\u00a0 consideration of\u00a0 the circumstance of premeditation.\u00a0 The nature and the circumstances which characterize the crime,\u00a0 the\u00a0 perversity of the culprit, and the material and moral injury are the same, and the fact that the victim was not predetermined does not affect nor alter the nature of the crime.\u00a0 The person having been deprived of his life by deeds executed with deliberate intent,\u00a0 the crime is\u00a0 considered a premeditated one, as the firm and persistent intention of the accused front the moment, before said death, when he received the order until the\u00a0 crime\u00a0 was committed is manifestly evident.\u00a0 Even though\u00a0 in a crime committed upon offer of money, reward or promise, premeditation\u00a0 is sometimes present, the latter not\u00a0 being\u00a0 inherent in the former, and there existing no incompatibility between\u00a0 the\u00a0 two, premeditation\u00a0 can\u00a0 not necessarily be\u00a0 considered\u00a0 as\u00a0 included merely because an offer of money, reward or promsie was made, for the latter might have existed without the former, the one being independent of the other.\u00a0 In the present case there can be no doubt that\u00a0 after the crime\u00a0 was agreed\u00a0 upon by means of a promise of reward, the criminal by his subsequent conduct showed\u00a0 a persistency and firm intent\u00a0 in his plan to carry out the crime which he intentionally agreed to execute, it being immaterial\u00a0 whether Datto Mupuck\u00a0 did or\u00a0 did\u00a0 not conceive the crime, once Manalinde obeyed the inducement and\u00a0 voluntarily executed it.\"\u00a0 (U. S.<i> vs.<\/i> The Moro Manalinde, 14 Phil. Rep., 77.)<br\/><\/blockquote>The trial court found that the crime charged was committed with the aggravating circumstances following:<br\/><br\/>8. When\u00a0 craft, fraud or disguise is employed.<br\/><br\/>9. When advantage is taken of superior strength or means are employed to weaken the defense.<br\/><br\/>10, When the act is committed with abuse of confidence.<br\/><br\/>11. When advantage is taken by the culprit of his public position.<br\/><br\/>13. When the crime is committed on the occasion of a fire, shipwreck, or other calamity or misfortune.<br\/><br\/>15. When it is committed at night, or in an uninhabited place, or by a gang.<br\/><br\/>16. When the crime is committed in contempt with insult to the public authorities.<br\/><br\/>As to number 8:<br\/><br\/>We do\u00a0 not\u00a0 believe that\u00a0 this circumstance\u00a0 was\u00a0 present. This\u00a0 circumstance is characterized\u00a0 by the intellectual or mental rather than the physical means to which the criminal resorts\u00a0 to\u00a0 carry out his design.\u00a0 This\u00a0 paragraph\u00a0 was intended to\u00a0 cover, for example, the\u00a0 case where a thief falsely represents that he is the lover of the servant of\u00a0 a house in order to gain entrance and rob the owner\u00a0 (<i>astucia<\/i>); or where (<i>fraude<\/i>)\u00a0 A simulates the\u00a0 handwriting\u00a0 of B, who is a friend of C, inviting the latter,\u00a0 without the knowledge of B, by means of a note written in such simulated hand, to meet B at a designated place, in\u00a0 order to give A, who lies in wait at the place\u00a0 appointed,\u00a0 an opportunity to\u00a0 kill C; or where\u00a0 (<i>disfraz<\/i>) one uses\u00a0 a\u00a0 disguise to prevent being recognized; and cases of that class and nature.<br\/><br\/>We are unable to find from the facts proved any element which warrants the conclusions of the learned trial court as to the presence of this\u00a0 circumstance in the commission of the crime\u00a0 of which the appellants were found guilty.\u00a0 They boldly marched from the mountains\u00a0 of\u00a0 Lipada to\u00a0 Davao, partly, at least, in the daytime, with the purpose of attacking the town,\u00a0 which purpose they communicated to at\u00a0 least three persons, one of whom was permitted to precede them to the town.\u00a0 They\u00a0 advanced against the town at about 4.15 in\u00a0 the afternoon without any effort at\u00a0 concealment. They were in no way disguised, but, on the contrary, each wore the greater portion of the Constabulary uniform in which he was clad at the time of the mutiny.\u00a0 While\u00a0 it appears that some of them had cloths wrapped about their heads, it does not appear that this was done as a disguise, but was following rather the custom of the country in which they had been reared.\u00a0 We find in all the case nothing of craft, fraud or disguise.<br\/><br\/>As to\u00a0 number 9:<br\/><br\/>This circumstance depends upon the relative strength of the one attacking and the one attacked.\u00a0 It can hardly be said that advantage is taken of superior strength or means are employed to weaken the defense when twenty-three men, in the daytime, openly and without stratagem of any kind, attack a town of the size of Davao.\u00a0\u00a0 The results of the attack clearly show that the strength of\u00a0 the attacking party was not sufficient to accomplish the purpose in view.\u00a0 They demonstrate, under the circumstances, that no means were employed to weaken\u00a0 the defense, outside of such as are inherent\u00a0 in the situation when one body\u00a0 of\u00a0 men attacks another with deadly weapons.<br\/><br\/>As to number 10:<br\/><br\/>For the existence of this circumstance it is necessary that there exist\u00a0 a relation of trust or confidence\u00a0 between the person committing the crime and the one\u00a0 against whom it is committed and that the former make use of such relation to commit the crime.\u00a0 For example, where one commits\u00a0 a robbery in a house in which, as a friend of the owner, he is at the time a guest.\u00a0 No relation of\u00a0 this nature existed between\u00a0 the appellants\u00a0 and the citizens of Davao or the deceased.\u00a0\u00a0 The evidence fails to disclose a single fact upon which the existence of this relation can be based.<br\/><br\/>As to number 11:<br\/><br\/>In order that this\u00a0 aggravating circumstance exist\u00a0 it is necessary that the person committing the crime be a public official and that he use the influence, prestige or ascendency which such office gives him as the means by which he realizes his purpose:\u00a0 The essence of the matter\u00a0 is presented in, the inquiry, \"Did the licensed abuse his office in order to commit the crime?\"\u00a0 We do not believe that the facts of this case warrant\u00a0 the finding of the trial court in this particular, (Supreme court of Spain, decisions of 4th\u00a0 March, 1872; 18th December, 1871.)<br\/><br\/>As to\u00a0 number 13:<br\/><br\/>The reason for the existence of this circumstance is found in the debased form of criminality met in one who, in the midst of a\u00a0 great\u00a0 calamity, instead of lending aid to the afflicted, adds to their suffering by taking advantage of their misfortune to despoil them.<br\/><br\/>As is readily seen from the\u00a0 facts, no such.condition as is described in this paragraph existed in Davao on the occasion of the attack.<br\/><br\/>As to number 15:<br\/><br\/>The second paragraph\u00a0 of this subdivision reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"The courts shall take this circumstance into consideration according to the nature and characteristics of the crime.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In this case, under all the circumstances, including those presented in the\u00a0 discussion relating to paragraph 9, the fact that there were more than three armed persons in the attacking party is not sufficient to call for the application of the provisions of this paragraph.<br\/><br\/>As to\u00a0 number 16:<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 supreme court of Spain has\u00a0 held \"that the circumstance of contempt of or insult to public authority, provided for in paragraph 16 of the Penal Code, can exist only when such authority is engaged in\u00a0 the exercise of its functions and he who is thus engaged in\u00a0 the exercise of said functions is not the person against\u00a0 whom the crime is committed in which that circumstance appears;\" the\u00a0 court further saying that such aggravating\u00a0 circumstance was not present in the case before\u00a0 it \"because D. Jose Torres, although he was municipal judge, was the\u00a0 object of the murder involved in that case.\"<br\/><br\/>In the\u00a0 case at bar, if the crime was committed with contempt of and insult to the public authorities, those authorities must have been the public authorities of Davao.\u00a0 But the persons exercising that authority were the very persons against\u00a0 whom, among others,\u00a0 the crime charged\u00a0 in\u00a0 this action was being committed.<br\/><br\/>After diligent investigation and extended consideration; we have been unable to find that any aggravating circumstance attended the commission of this crime.<br\/><br\/>There being present no aggravating circumstance\u00a0 and there existing no\u00a0 extenuating\u00a0 circumstances,\u00a0 the penalty imposed must be in its medium degree.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below is hereby modified\u00a0 and the appellants are each sentenced to c<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">adena perpetua<\/span>, to the accessories provided by law, to pay, jointly and severally, to the heirs of the deceased\u00a0 Roy Libby the sum of P1,000 and to pay the costs of the trial.<br\/><br\/>So modified, the judgment is affirmed, with costs against the appellants.<br\/><br\/><i> Arellano, C.

It is claimed by the seminary that it includes a portion of one of the public squares of that city.\u00a0 Aside from that of the ownership of the land, there are two questions raised on the trial and presented for review on this appeal.\u00a0 The first one relates to the <i>quantity<\/i> of the land claimed by the seminary, and the secpnd to its precise <i>location.<\/i>\u00a0 The claim of the city is that, even admitting petitioner's ownership\u00a0 of the land described in its muniments of title, still the city must\u00a0 have a judgment in its\u00a0 favor for the reason that, from the description presented in said\u00a0 muniments, it appears clearly that the land in question does not extend into or include any portion of the plaza occupied by the city.\u00a0\u00a0 The city asserts that there is, and\u00a0 for many years has been, a\u00a0 well-defined boundary, formerly a wall,\u00a0 latterly an\u00a0 iron fence (<i>enverjada<\/i>), separating\u00a0 from the\u00a0 public square the land upon which\u00a0 stands the\u00a0 church\u00a0 belonging to\u00a0 the seminary, and that the lands mentioned and described in the documents of title presented by the seminary lie between the church and the iron fence and\u00a0 do not, therefore, extend into the plaza.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 land in dispute in\u00a0 this case admittedly\u00a0 lies to the south of the church\u00a0 belonging to the seminary.\u00a0 This church, according to the\u00a0 plans and the evidence, is located upon a plot of ground adjoining the\u00a0 public square on its north side. So that the land in question,\u00a0 if it does not extend into the plaza,\u00a0 necessarily\u00a0 lies\u00a0 between\u00a0 it and\u00a0 the church.\u00a0 This clearly appears from the plan, Exhibit J, presented by the petitioner and is a fact undisputed in the record.<br\/><br\/>The first question to be determined,\u00a0 then, is whether the land in question lies\u00a0 within the inclosure, the southern boundary of which is formed by the iron fence, or whether it or any portion of it lies beyond said fence, thereby\u00a0 including a portion of the land used as a public square.\u00a0\u00a0 The problem as to the quantity of the land will resolve itself at the same time with the determination of\u00a0 the present question.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 petitioner\u00a0 has introduced in evidence in this case certified copies of two documents, the one, Exhibit E, bearing date the 12th day of November, 1783, and the other, Exhibit F,\u00a0 of date the 4th day of May, 1784.\u00a0 These\u00a0 documents contain the acts and manifestations of the <i>Audiencia de Manila<\/i> performed and made for the purpose of formally delivering the property which, by royal decree previously published,\u00a0 had\u00a0 been\u00a0 transferred\u00a0 from\u00a0 the ownership of the expatriated Jesuits to that of the Seminary of San Carlos, or its antecessor.\u00a0 These actuaciones present inventories of all\u00a0 the property thus\u00a0 transferred to the seminary, among such\u00a0 property\u00a0 being: the lands in question.\u00a0 Each\u00a0 one contains a description of such lands.\u00a0 The description contained in Exhibit E is:<br\/><blockquote>\"Siguese una huerta grande que esta al lado de la Iglesia hacia el sur, tiene de largo cuarenta y nueve brazas castelianas y de ancho treinta y ocho brazas.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The description contained in Exhibit F of that which was intended to be\u00a0 the same property is:<br\/><blockquote>\"Ciudad.\u00a0 Primeramente.\u00a0\u00a0 Dos solares\u00a0 vacios\u00a0 por\u00a0 no vivir en ellos persona alguna lindan\u00a0 por la parte del norte con la Iglesia que era de dichos regulares la que al\u00a0 presente sirve de Catedral\u00a0 contiguos a dicha Iglesia; por la del sur con la Plaza de la Real Fuerza del San Pedro y casa Real; por la del este con la Marino inmediatos a ellos; y por la del oeste calle en medio para\u00a0 dicha casa Real con dos solares, que asimismo pertenecian a dichos regulares y\u00a0 en uno de dichos solares,\u00a0 so halla plantada\u00a0 la casa de mi dicho castellano Don Manuel Ignacio del Corro.\u00a0 El motivo\u00a0 por que dichos dos solares se hallan vacfos, es por que los habian ocupado los anunciados regulares con una huerta que tenian la que en el dia\u00a0 ya no existe.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Exhibit E gives the following as\u00a0 indicating the size of said lots:<br\/><blockquote>\"Diez y nueve solares y\u00a0 medio\u00a0 de a veinticinco brazas en cuadro\u00a0 cada solar entero que se\u00a0 hallan los quince\u00a0 y medio en la plaza de\u00a0 esta\u00a0 referida ciudad, y las cuatro restantes en la Isla\u00a0 de Tinago.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In\u00a0 dealing with the question whether or\u00a0 not the\u00a0 above descriptions include a portion of the public square or plaza, we must not lose sight of the fact, already noted, that the city of Cebu asserts that the lands described by these exhibits lie between the church building and the iron fence to the south of the church,\u00a0 which iron\u00a0 fence marks, as the city alleges, the termination of petitioner's land and the beginning of the\u00a0 opponent's.\u00a0 Looking at the\u00a0 plan of the lands in question,\u00a0 Exhibit J, we observe\u00a0 that the church building is somewhat close to the iron fence (line A B), being in one place less than 4 meters distant,\u00a0 in another less than 116 meters, and in another less than 21 meters.\u00a0 Now, if the limits of the lands lying in front of the church and between it and the iron fence should be continued so that they wduld extend as far\u00a0 east and west as does the line A B, and then lines should be drawn to inclose the land thus comprehended between the church and the line A B, there would be within that inclosure all of the land which the city claims is described by the\u00a0 petitioner's muniments of title.\u00a0 Simple arithmetic will determine whether the city's contention\u00a0 in this regard is correct or not.\u00a0 The line A B, which is the southern boundary of the land thus inclosed,\u00a0 is 87.40 meters long. The north boundary line of said\u00a0 land is,\u00a0 under the city's contention, the\u00a0 line of the walls of the church building. From the plan it will be readily seen that said line is\u00a0 very broken, following, as the city claims it does, the walls of the church.\u00a0 The\u00a0 strip\u00a0 of land inclosed\u00a0 as\u00a0 above\u00a0 set forth, therefore, varies in\u00a0 width, growing narrower as the walls of the\u00a0 church approach the iron\u00a0 fence and wider as\u00a0 they recede\u00a0 from it.\u00a0\u00a0 At its widest place\u00a0 it can not exceed, as we have before seen, 21 meters.\u00a0 In\u00a0 some places it is less than 4 meters wide, and in still others less than 16.\u00a0\u00a0 This being so, it will be more than fair to the contention of the city to assume, for the purposes of a mathematical demonstration, that the strip of\u00a0 land\u00a0 comprehended between the church and the iron\u00a0 fence\u00a0 (line A B)\u00a0 is 87.40 meters\u00a0 long and 21\u00a0 meters wide.\u00a0 The area of the strip is,\u00a0 therefore, 1,835.4 square\u00a0 meters.\u00a0 This is in reality a larger area than any piece of land lying between the church and the iron fence could possibly have, and, therefore, as we have before said, our assumption is more than fair to the city's contention. Now, if we take the description of land as found in one of the petitioner's exhibits wherein it speaks of it being 49 Spanish brazas long and 38 Spanish <i>brazas <\/i>wide, we have a parcel of land containing more than 4,000 square meters, or more than twice the size of the largest parcel that could possibly be\u00a0 contained between the\u00a0 church and\u00a0 the iron fence.\u00a0\u00a0 If, on\u00a0 the other hand, we take the description\u00a0 as it is found in the other exhibit of the petitioner, wherein the land\u00a0 is described as two parcels of land, each 25\u00a0 <i>brazas <\/i> square, we readily see that such a\u00a0 parcel of land could not possibly be contained between the church and the iron fence, as its area would be more than 3,000 square meters.\u00a0 Inasmuch as the strip of land comprehended between the church\u00a0 and the iron fence could not, as we have seen, contain more than 1,835.4 square meters, it is, therefore, evident that the land described in petitioner's exhibits far\u00a0 exceeds in extent that lying between the church and the iron fence; and such land must, therefore, extend beyond the iron fence into what\u00a0 is known as the public plaza,\u00a0 it being admitted that the iron fence marks the northern boundary of said plaza. The correctness of the plan, Exhibit J, as presented by the petitioner, has not been impugned by the evidence in any manner which is beneficial to the city.\u00a0 There appears to be a large difference between the amount of land as described in one of the petitioner's exhibits and that included within the plan, the latter\u00a0 containing considerably less\u00a0 than\u00a0 the amount set out\u00a0 in the\u00a0 description in said exhibit.\u00a0 Apart from this inconsistency, an\u00a0 inconsistency by\u00a0 which the city seems to profit, the correctness of the\u00a0 plan is\u00a0 not questioned in the record.\u00a0 As to the discrepancy existing between the amount of land as described in the other exhibit of\u00a0 the petitioner and that presented by the\u00a0 plan, the difference\u00a0 is so slight\u00a0 as\u00a0 to\u00a0 be substantially negligible.\u00a0 The land\u00a0 described in the plan contains 3,576 square meters; while under the description in petitioner's Exhibit F the land contains about 3,494.4 square meters, a difference of only 82,4 square meters.<br\/><br\/>Even though what we have already said be taken in its broadest sense, it does not entirely dispose of the city's contention.\u00a0\u00a0 Even though it be admitted, as we\u00a0 have found, that the land shown by petitioner's muniments of title, to have\u00a0 belonged once to it includes a\u00a0 portion of the public square referred to, the query naturally suggests itself, <i>how much<\/i> of the plaza does it include.\u00a0 While we have already intimated that the amount of the public square included in the description of petitioner's land is\u00a0 so much thereof as is described in the plan Exhibit J, such intimation, embracing, as it does, a conclusion from facts not\u00a0 presented, needs some explanation to make it clear; for, even though it be conceded that such land extends into the public square, still it will be found to extend\u00a0 thereinto more or\u00a0 less, depending upon whether the measurement be taken from the iron fence or from\u00a0 the walls of the church building.\u00a0 In other\u00a0 words, if the measurement be made from the\u00a0 <i>iron fence<\/i> southward, there will be included more of the square than if it be made from\u00a0 the <i>walls of the church building. <\/i> It is the city's contention that, in measuring the lands claimed by the petitioner and described in its exhibits, such measurement must be taken from the very walls of the church building and\u00a0 not from\u00a0 the iron fence.\u00a0\u00a0 For this reason the city\u00a0 asserts that it is one of the vices\u00a0 of Exhibit J that its measurements begin with the iron fence and not the walls of the church, thereby including much more of the public square than would be included if the measurements were taken from the iron fence.\u00a0 In support of this claim the city refers to the wording of the descriptions of the land as\u00a0 shown in the\u00a0 two exhibits, already presented, wherein the land is spoken of as \"una\u00a0 huerta grande que esta <i>al lado\u00a0 de\u00a0 la Iglesia hacia el sur\" <\/i> and, also as a\u00a0 parcel of land \"linda por\u00a0 la parte\u00a0 del norte<i> con la Iglesia.<\/i>\"<br\/><br\/>We do not believe that this contention\u00a0 is sound.\u00a0\u00a0 In\u00a0 the first place, under the general rules regulating the construction of words and phrases in cases of this character, the word \"church,\" as used in the description, refers to the <i>land upon which the church stands,<\/i> and\u00a0 not to the church\u00a0 building itself.\u00a0 In the\u00a0 second place, it is unquestioned\u00a0 that, under the\u00a0 description\u00a0 referred to,\u00a0 the north line of the\u00a0 lands in question, as\u00a0 well as the other lines, is straight,\u00a0 the lots being each 25 Spanish brazas square.\u00a0 But, as we have already seen, the line made by the south wall of the church, which, under the city's contention, would be the northern boundary line of the land in question, is extremely broken and crooked. This is clearly shown by the plan Exhibit J, in which the line of the said south wall presents no\u00a0 less than\u00a0 six angles.\u00a0 It is, therefore, impossible that the northern boundary line of the land in question be the line of\u00a0 the church wall, the one being a\u00a0 straight line and\u00a0 the\u00a0 other a crooked\u00a0 one.\u00a0 Such lines can not be coincident.\u00a0 For the same reason it would be impossible to determine from which portion\u00a0 of the wall the measurement of\u00a0 the land in question should be taken. Should it be taken from the eastern end of the wall, or from the western\u00a0 end, which is about 15 meters\u00a0 farther south, or from\u00a0 the\u00a0 central\u00a0 portion of the\u00a0 wall, which\u00a0 is about 10 meters still farther south ?\u00a0 It is apparent that,\u00a0 if the point of departure for measuring the 25\u00a0 brazas is to\u00a0 be the wall of the building itself, that point is\u00a0 variable in its location, depending\u00a0 upon which portion of the wall is taken as the point from which the measurement is\u00a0 made.\u00a0 The mere statement of this contention shows its weakness.\u00a0 Lastly: The\u00a0 witness for the city, Sr.\u00a0 Rallos, stated that, in\u00a0 his boyhood, there was, at the south of the church and at a considerable distance therefrom a wall\u00a0 which\u00a0 ran along the premises upon which the church was located, forming, apparently, the southern boundary line thereof; that between that wall, the place\u00a0 of which was\u00a0 later\u00a0 taken by the iron fence several times referred to,\u00a0 and the fence\u00a0 which surrounded\u00a0 the monument of\u00a0 Magellan\u00a0 there intervened a distance of from 25 to SO brazas.\u00a0\u00a0 The wall\u00a0 referred to by the witness is clearly not the wall\u00a0 of the church building. It appears from\u00a0 his testimony also that the<i> paseo de Dolores<\/i> was located to the south of the wall or iron fence; and that, therefore, the land in dispute, which includes said paseo, could\u00a0 not have been\u00a0 located between the\u00a0 church building and the iron fence.\u00a0 The same facts appear from\u00a0 the testimony of other witnesses of the city.<br\/><br\/>Under the evidence, then, we must\u00a0 conclude, with the learned trial court, that a portion of the land now occupied by the city of Cebu as a public plaza is land described in the petitioner's exhibits, and is so much of\u00a0 said land as is contained in the plan\u00a0 marked petitioner's Exhibit J.\u00a0\u00a0 As to a paper title to said land so occupied as a public square, the city has presented none.\u00a0 To that land it shows no documentary or record title whatever.\u00a0\u00a0 The paper title of the petitioner to such land is entirely unmet and uncontradicted. The city presents no\u00a0 rights to or interest in the same except that acquired\u00a0 by long years of actual\u00a0 occupation.\u00a0 It signifies no source from which\u00a0 comes any other right or interest and asserts no ability to disclose any.\u00a0\u00a0 Its\u00a0 ownership is based japon prescription solely.<br\/><br\/>Were it not for\u00a0 petitioner's Exhibit K, we\u00a0 would be inclined to hold, upon the record, that the opponent's\u00a0 occupation had ripened into a\u00a0 title by prescription.\u00a0 We would be disposed to say that the\u00a0 proofs show that the city has occupied the lands in question adversely since the year 1863, and that, by reason thereof, it has acquired title under the provisions of the Civil Code relating to prescription.\u00a0 In view\u00a0 of that exhibit, however, we\u00a0 do not find it necessary to determine that question, inasmuch as, in our judgment that exhibit demonstrates conclusively that\u00a0 such occupation was permissive and not adverse, was under license and not under claim of right, and could not, therefore, be made the basis of a prescriptive title.<br\/><br\/>Before presenting that exhibit, it should\u00a0 be said that the proofs uncontradictedly demonstrate that the possession by the city of the land in question was initiated\u00a0 and maintained, down to the year 1890, when the <i>ayuntamiento<\/i> of Cebu was formed,\u00a0 by the pohtical\u00a0 and military governor of Cebu; that every act of possession and dominion exercised during the improvements made thereon were made by his direction and with provincial moneys; that, so far as appears from the record, not a single act of possession or dominion over said land was exercised except through him during al] the years\u00a0 from 1863 down\u00a0 to 1890.\u00a0 From the latter year to the time of the American occupation, the <i>ayuntamiento,<\/i> according\u00a0 to the evidence, seems to have maintained the possession.<br\/><br\/>As to said exhibit; On or about the 8th day of June, 1869, there seems to have arisen\u00a0 a controversy over the possession of the land in question.\u00a0 Although, apart from the document then executed, the evidence is somewhat uncertain and vague as to what actually happened,\u00a0 nevertheless, from what appears, it is a necessary deduction that\u00a0 the seminary, oh or about\u00a0 that date, interferred with the possession of the city and requested that the matter be adjusted to the end that the rights\u00a0 of the parties in the land might be made clear. The political and military governor of Cebu\u00a0 being, as we have seen, the official under whose orders and directions possession\u00a0 of the land had been taken and maintained, the officials of the seminary naturally went to him for an adjustment.\u00a0 As a result\u00a0 of that adjustment the following document,\u00a0 petitioner's Exhibit K, was executed by the political\u00a0 and military\u00a0 governor of Cebu, Joaquin Monet:<br\/><center><br\/>PETITIONER'S EXHIBIT\u00a0 K.<br\/><\/center> <blockquote>\"Don Joaquin\u00a0 Monet y Estevez,\u00a0 military and\u00a0 political governor, with the assistance of the attesting witnesses, etc., does hereby certify, in due form, that part of the Plaza Urbiztondo included in the work which is now being done for a public promenade to be known as \"Dolores\"\u00a0 belongs to the\u00a0 Seminary of San Carlos and\u00a0 the Chaplaincy of the Cathedral,\u00a0 according to the topographical plan of this city on file\u00a0 in the archives of the said Seminary, which said land has been ceded by\u00a0 the rector, Jose Casaramona,\u00a0 and the devout parish priest, Leon Esequiel, the persons\u00a0 charged with the preservation of the property belonging\u00a0 to their respective trusts, this as long as the said promenade which embellishes the town exists as such.<br\/><br\/>\"In testimony thereof, and at the request of the interested parties,\u00a0 I issue these presents in triplicate at Cebu\u00a0 this eighth day of June, one thousand eight hundred and sixty- nine,<br\/><br\/><table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" width=\"100%\"> <tbody><tr> <td width=\"50%\">\u00a0<\/td> <td width=\"50%\">(Signed)\u00a0\u00a0 \"JOAQUIN MONET.<\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td>\u00a0<\/td> <td>(Signed)\u00a0\u00a0 \"LORENZO ESPINA.<\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td>\u00a0<\/td> <td>(Signed)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"CALIXTO DEL CAPA.\"<\/td> <\/tr> <\/tbody><\/table><\/blockquote>The instrument, in our opinion, conclusively characterizes the occupation of the land in question and renders untenable the position of the city thai its possession was adverse and under claim of right and should be made the basis\u00a0 of prescriptive title under\u00a0 the Civil Code.\u00a0 That code provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"Art, 1941.\u00a0 Possession\u00a0 must be\u00a0 in the capacity of an owner, public, peaceful, and uninterrupted.<br\/><br\/>\"Art. 1942.\u00a0 Acts of a possessory character, performed by virtue of a license, or by mere tolerance on the part of the owner, are of no effect for establishing possession.\"<br\/><br\/>\"Art.\u00a0 1948.\u00a0 Any\u00a0 express\u00a0 or implied\u00a0 acknowledgment which the\u00a0 possessor may make with regard to the right of the owner also interrupts possession.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/><\/blockquote>The law presented by these articles is substantially the same as ihat laid down by the American courts.\u00a0 It is there generally held that \"any act of recognition or acknowledgment of a superior\u00a0 title in another during the period of adverse possession,\u00a0 will, as av general rule,\u00a0 amount to an interruption of the continuity of the possession and defeat the operation of the statute.\"<br\/><br\/>The political\u00a0 and\u00a0 military governor of\u00a0 Cebu, being the official by whose acts the possession of the land\u00a0 in question was begun and maintained on behalf of the city, particularly prior to and at the time of the execution of the above\u00a0 instrument, all acts and words of his giving color to that possession are binding upon the city and conclusive as to\u00a0 the quality thereof.<br\/><br\/>The city seeks to evade the legal effects of this document in two ways: First, by asserting that it has not been properly proved for admission as evidence, in that the signature of Joaquin Monet was not shown to be genuine; and,\u00a0 second, by contending that said Joaquin Monet was not, as a matter of fact, political and military governor of Cebu at the time that the document bears date.<br\/><br\/>Neither\u00a0 of\u00a0 these\u00a0 contentions\u00a0 can be\u00a0 maintained.\u00a0 The document in question having been\u00a0 executed in\u00a0 the\u00a0 year 1869, and having subsequently been generally acted upon as genuine by persons having an interest in the subject matter involved, and its custody having been\u00a0 satisfactorily explained, its genuineness must be\u00a0 presumed under the provisions of section 334, paragraph 34, of\u00a0 the\u00a0 Code of\u00a0 Civil Procedure.\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, sections 326 and\u00a0 327 of said\u00a0 Code provide that:<br\/><blockquote>\"SEC. 326. <i>When other evidence of the\u00a0 execution of writing need,not be produced<\/i>. - Where a writing is more\u00a0 than thirty years old, and evidence is given that the party against whom the writing is offered\u00a0 has\u00a0 at any\u00a0 time admitted its execution, or where\u00a0 the writing is one produced\u00a0 from the custody of\u00a0 the adverse party, and has been\u00a0 acted upon by him\u00a0 as genuine, no other evidence of the\u00a0 execution need be given.<br\/><br\/>\"SEC. 327. <i>Proof of handwriting<\/i>. - The handwriting of a person may be proved by anyone who believes it to\u00a0 be his, and has seen him write, or has seen writing purporting to be his, upon which\u00a0 he has acted,\u00a0 or been charged,\u00a0 and he has thus acquired knowledge of his handwriting.\u00a0 Evidence respecting the handwriting may also be given by comparison, made by the court,\u00a0 with writings admitted or treated as genuine by the party against\u00a0 whom the evidence is offered, or proved to be genuine to the satisfaction\u00a0 of the judge. Where the\u00a0 writing is more than thirty yeafs old, the\u00a0 comparisons may\u00a0 be made\u00a0 with writings\u00a0 purported to be genuine, and generally respected and acted upon as such by persons haying an interest and knowing\u00a0 the fact.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>For the\u00a0 purpose\u00a0 of making the comparisons, mentioned in the last section, the petitioner offered in evidence a bound volume of official\u00a0 communications from the political and military governor of Cebu to the Bishop of Cebu.\u00a0 Several of said official communications, bearing dates November 20, 1867, December 14, 1867, January 9,\u00a0 1868, February\u00a0 13, 1868, February 17, 1868, February 22, 1868,, and November 11,1868, are signed by said Joaquin Monet as \"El gobernador interino\" of the politico-military government of the Visayas. The\u00a0 signatures to\u00a0 those documents are genuine.\u00a0 From a comparison of the signature on Exhibit K with those on\u00a0 the official communications,\u00a0 it is manifest,\u00a0 as the learned trial court found,\u00a0 that the signature on the exhibit is genuine. Moreover, that document, as a whole, bears every evidence of being genuine.<br\/><br\/>As to the second contention of the city that Joaquin Monet was\u00a0 not, in reality, political-military governor\u00a0 of Cebu at the time said instrument was executed, it also must be rejected.\u00a0 We are\u00a0 confident that the said\u00a0 document is a genuine document\u00a0 and that\u00a0 Joaquin Monet was governor of Cebu at the time the same was signed.\u00a0 That he was such governor at such time is clearly demonstrated by\u00a0 the official\u00a0 <i>\"Gaceta de Manila<\/i>,\" dated June 22, 1869, in which, on page 1207, appears the name of Joaquin Monet as\u00a0 political and military\u00a0 governor of Cebu.\u00a0 On that page is seen an official document formulated and signed by him as such governor on the 5th day of June, 1869.\u00a0\u00a0 In the said <i>\"Gaceta de Manila<\/i>\" of July 22, 1869, at page 164, appears another official\u00a0 document formulated and signed by said Joaquin Monet, as governor of Cebu, which document bears date the 5th day of July, 1869.\u00a0 Both of these writings\u00a0 were official documents\u00a0 made and\u00a0 signed by him in the course of the performance\u00a0 of his official duties as political and military governor of Cebu.\u00a0\u00a0 In this connection\u00a0 it must be remembered that the disputed document, Exhibit K,\u00a0 bears date the 8th day of June,\u00a0 1869, only three days after the date borne by said document of June\u00a0 5th above\u00a0 mentioned.\u00a0 It should\u00a0 also be noted that,\u00a0 in writing the official communications\u00a0 found in Exhibit L,\u00a0 said bound volume of official communications, Joaquin\u00a0 Monet\u00a0 was\u00a0 acting\u00a0 as\u00a0 governor interim of the politico-military- government of the Visayan Islands.\u00a0 In signing the disputed document he acted as the political-military<i> governor<\/i>\u00a0 (not <i>interino<\/i>) of<i> Cebu,<\/i> not the <i> Visayan Islands<\/i>.\u00a0\u00a0 Most of\u00a0 the\u00a0 argument\u00a0 of the learned counsel for the city in relation to the second contention is founded in a failure to observe the distinction between the official character of Joaquin Monet as manifested in Exhibit L and that shown in Exhibit K.<br\/><br\/>Exhibit K, however, must be taken as it reads.\u00a0 Its benefits and its obligations go hand in hand.\u00a0 If the\u00a0 seminary asks the advantages which\u00a0 it confers it can not escape the obligations which\u00a0 it imposes.\u00a0 That instrument\u00a0 not\u00a0 only gives character to the possession which the city then had and thereafter claimed to have of the land in dispute, rendering that\u00a0 possession incapable of being used as\u00a0 the\u00a0 basis\u00a0 of prescriptive\u00a0 rights, but it also gives the city\u00a0 the right to continue in that possession as long as it remains of the kind described therein, namely, \"as long as the said promenade which embellishes the town exists as such.\"\u00a0\u00a0 In\u00a0 other words, it makes, or, at least, recognizes as already made,\u00a0 a cession of the use of the land in question to the city of Cebu so long as the same\u00a0 continues to be used in\u00a0 the manner\u00a0 in which it was then being used or for the purposes for which it was then\u00a0 being prepared to be\u00a0 used.\u00a0 There\u00a0 was\u00a0 a legal\u00a0 consideration for this obligation, thus rendering it\u00a0 enforceable, even though it be urged that the transaction could not have been called a voluntary dedication to public\u00a0 use.\u00a0\u00a0 Nor may it now\u00a0 be contended that the church officials\u00a0 who appear to have taken part in\u00a0 the transaction were not authorized and had no power to bind the seminary or the church.\u00a0 That instrument has long been a\u00a0 record of the church, known to it through all its\u00a0 officials, and has been presented by the church in\u00a0 this\u00a0 litigation as an efficacious and enforceable instrument\u00a0 Its benefits may not be taken\u00a0 and its obligations rejected.\u00a0 It can\u00a0 not be interpreted to bind and loose at the same time to the same party.<br\/><br\/>For these\u00a0 reasons it is our opinion\u00a0 that the petitioner has the legal title to the land in dispute,\u00a0 but that the city of Cebu has the right to the possession, occupation and use of said land for the purposes above expressed and presented in said Exhibit K, above quoted, to be so occupied and possessed so long as said land is dedicated to the\u00a0 uses and purposes therein expressed.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below is modified and the land described in Exhibit J is hereby ordered\u00a0 registered in the name of the petitioner, but such registration is subject to and must affirmatively show the rights of the city of Gebu to the possession, occupation and use of said land as herein above set forth.\u00a0 As modified, said judgment is affirmed.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

The court\u00a0 erred in imposing the costs\u00a0 upon the oppositor.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>With reference to the\u00a0 first\u00a0 assignment of error above noted, it appears from the record that upon the 13th day of January,\u00a0 1910, Emigdio Zarate executed his last will and testament, the original of which appears in the record and is marked \"Exhibit A.\"\u00a0 Emigdio Zarate died on the 19th day of January,\u00a0 1910.<\/p><p>From an\u00a0 examination of said Exhibit A it appears to have been signed by Emigdio Zarate and by four witnesses, Sabino M. Sandoval, Esteban Sandoval, George Zarate\u00a0 and Eugenio Zarate.\u00a0\u00a0 From the record it appears that the testator\u00a0 dictated his will in the Pangasinan dialect and it was then translated\u00a0 into\u00a0 Spanish.\u00a0 After the will had\u00a0 been written in Spanish it was read to the deceased and translated to him in the Pangasinan dialect, and, according: to the allegations of the appellee, the said Exhibit A received his approval\u00a0 as his last will and testament.<\/p><p>The appellant alleges that at the time of the execution of the said alleged will of Emigdio Zarate, he was not in the full possession of his mental faculties.\u00a0 This question was presented to the lower court.\u00a0 After hearing the evidence, the lower court found that Emigdio Zarate, at the time of the execution of the said will, was in the possession of his faculties.\u00a0\u00a0 Two of the witnesses who signed the\u00a0 will,\u00a0 as well as others who were present in the house at the time the said will was executed, testified that in their opinion Emigdio Zarate was of sound mind and memory at the\u00a0 time\u00a0 he signed the said will.\u00a0 Practically the only testimony to the contrary adduced during the trial of the cause in the lower court was the testimony given by two doctors, one of whom had not\u00a0 seen\u00a0 the deceased\u00a0 for many months before his death, whose testimony was based wholly upon hypothetical questions.<\/p><p>The appellant\u00a0 attempted to show\u00a0 that Emigdio Zarate for some\u00a0 months prior to his death had been troubled with insomnia, as well as some other physical infirmities.\u00a0 The hypothetical questions were based upon the question whether or not a person who had been suffering with\u00a0 insomnia for some months would have sufficient mental capacity to\u00a0 execute a will.\u00a0 The two doctors who appeared on behalf of the opponents testified that insomnia tended to destroy the mental capacity, but that there were times, even during the period while they were suffering from insomnia, when they would be perfectly rational.\u00a0\u00a0 Even admitting that there was some foundation\u00a0 for the supposition\u00a0 that Emigdio Zarate had suffered from the alleged infirmities, we do not believe that the testimony was sufficiently direct and positive, based upon\u00a0 the\u00a0 hypothetical questions, to overcome the positive and direct testimony of the witnesses who were present\u00a0 at the time\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 execution\u00a0 of the will\u00a0 in question.\u00a0\u00a0 The evidence adduced during the trial of the case, shows a large preponderance of proof in favor of the fact that Emigdio Zarate was in the full possession of his mental faculties at the time he executed his last will and testament.<\/p><p>The second and third assignments\u00a0 of error may\u00a0 be considered together.\u00a0 Upon the question\u00a0 presented by the said assignments of error,\u00a0 the lower court found from the evidence that Emigdio Zarate executed his last will and testament without threats, force or pressure or illegal influence. The basis of the claim that undue influence had been exercised over Emigdio Zarate is that a day or two before the said will was\u00a0 made, it is claimed by the opponent, Maria Calderon, that the deceased promised to will to her a certain house (one-half of which seems to belong to her) upon the payment by her to the deceased of the sum\u00a0 of P300.\u00a0 The P3O0 was never paid to the deceased and the said property was not willed to the defendant herein.\u00a0 The agreement between Maria Calderon and the\u00a0 deceased, if there was an agreement, seems to have been made between them privately, at least at the time the will was made the deceased made no reference to it whatever.\u00a0 Those\u00a0 present at the time the will was made\u00a0 and the witnesses who signed the same heard no statement or conversation\u00a0 relating to the said agreement, between the opponent herein and the deceased. There is no proof in the record which shows that any person even spoke to the deceased with reference to the willing of the said\u00a0 house to the\u00a0 opponent.\u00a0\u00a0 There is nothing in the record to indicate in the slightest degree that any\u00a0 person interested in the will,\u00a0 or who was present at the time of the making of the\u00a0 same,\u00a0 induced or\u00a0 attempted to\u00a0 induce the deceased not to will the said house to\u00a0 the opponent herein.\u00a0 The theory of the opponent that the deceased did not will to her the house in question is a mere presumption and there is not a scintilla of evidence in\u00a0 the record to support it.<\/p><p>The fourth, fifth,\u00a0 and sixth assignments of error may be considered\u00a0 together.<\/p><p>During the trial of the cause two of the persons who signed the will as witnesses appeared and testified.\u00a0 They testified that the deceased signed the will in their presence and in the presence of the other witnesses to the will; that they each\u00a0 signed the will in the\u00a0 presence of the\u00a0 testator and in the presence of the other witnesses;\u00a0 that the other two witnesses who were\u00a0 not called also signed the will in the\u00a0 presence of the testator and\u00a0 in\u00a0 the presence\u00a0 of each of the other witnesses.\u00a0\u00a0 There is no sufficient proof in the record to overcome the declarations of these witnesses.\u00a0\u00a0 We find no reason, therefore, for modifying the conclusion of the lower court upon these assignments of error.<\/p><p>With reference to\u00a0 the seventh\u00a0 assignment of error, to wit:\u00a0 that the court erred in rendering judgment\u00a0 without waiting for the written arguments of both parties, it may be said that it\u00a0 is customary for\u00a0 courts\u00a0 to\u00a0 wait until\u00a0 the parties have presented their arguments before deciding a cause, nevertheless, it is not reversible error for\u00a0 a court to decide a cause without waiting for written arguments to be presented\u00a0 by the\u00a0 respective attorneys.\u00a0 It\u00a0 appears from the record (p. 102) that\u00a0 the trial of\u00a0 the cause was closed on the 5th of August, 1910, and that the\u00a0 decision in the cause was not rendered until\u00a0 the 5th of October, 1910, or until after\u00a0 two months had expired.\u00a0 There is nothing in\u00a0 the record which shows that either of the attorneys during these two months\u00a0 asked for additional time in which to present their written arguments.\u00a0 It also\u00a0 appears of record (p. 102) that the respective attorneys asked for fifteen days' time within which to present their written arguments.\u00a0\u00a0 There\u00a0 is nothing in the\u00a0 record which shows whether they presented their written arguments\u00a0 or not. If there was any fault for not having the written arguments presented before the decision was rendered in the cause, it was clearly not the fault of the judge.<\/p><p>The arguments heretofore given seem to be sufficient also to answer the eighth and\u00a0 ninth assignments\u00a0 of error.<\/p><p>Upon a\u00a0 full consideration of the evidence and\u00a0 the\u00a0 assignments\u00a0 of error,\u00a0 we are of the opinion that the will of Emigdio Zarate, deceased,\u00a0 was executed and signed in entire conformity with all\u00a0 the requirements and\u00a0 solemnities required by law.\u00a0 Therefore the\u00a0 judgment\u00a0 of the lower court is hereby affirmed with costs.<\/p><p><em>Torres, Carson,<\/em> and <em>Moreland, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<\/p><\/div>",

Second. That the\u00a0 pledge\u00a0 in pawn of said jewels by the husband of the\u00a0 plaintiff was without her knowledge\u00a0 and consent,\u00a0 and that by no conduct of hers was that act subsequently ratified.<br\/><br\/>The defendants, in this court, for the purpose of avoiding liability, assert\u00a0 that the plaintiff\u00a0 and her\u00a0 husband constituted a company known as C. W. Mead &amp; Co., a contracting firm, and that the jewels in question were pawned to the defendants by\u00a0 the plaintiff's husband for\u00a0 the\u00a0 purpose of raising funds to conduct the business of\u00a0 that company; that said funds went into and formed a part of the assets of that company and\u00a0 that the\u00a0 plaintiff thereby received the benefits of such pawn; that this being so,\u00a0 she ought not now to be heard to impugn the pawn or to escape the results of the act of the managing member of the company.<br\/><br\/>In reply to this, it is\u00a0 sufficient to say that\u00a0 the jewels were pawned personally by the plaintiff's husband; that the plaintiff knew nothing of such pawn and never consented thereto; that she knew nothing\u00a0 of the purpose to which\u00a0 such funds were\u00a0 destined and knew nothing whatever of that transaction or of\u00a0 any detail thereof until she had returned to this country from abroad several months after it had been consummated; that she never ratified that act,\u00a0 but always disavowed any\u00a0 part\u00a0 in it; that such assertion\u00a0 of the\u00a0 defendants is in opposition\u00a0 to the allegation of their answer, in which\u00a0 they\u00a0 say that\u00a0 the\u00a0 proceeds\u00a0 of the\u00a0 pawn were dedicated to the ordinary uses of the family as such.\u00a0 But, under any view, no person may be deprived\u00a0 of his property without his knowledge\u00a0 or consent upon the assertion that the proceeds\u00a0 of such property or\u00a0 a portion thereof have gone\u00a0 to the. beneficial use of a company of which he may have\u00a0 been a member.<br\/><br\/>Upon the whole, we are fully convinced that the case was correctly decided by the learned trial court.\u00a0 After a careful\u00a0 consideration of\u00a0 the\u00a0 arguments\u00a0 presented in\u00a0 the very\u00a0 able briefs of counsel and a thorough study of\u00a0 the record,\u00a0 we are clearly\u00a0 of the opinion that the judgment ought to be affirmed.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is, therefore, affirmed, with costs\u00a0 against\u00a0 the appellants.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

K. Freeman, James L. Pierce, and Burton Whitcomb, as owners and operators of the Manila&nbsp; Steam&nbsp; Laundry, to recover the sum oa P952 alleged to be the balance due the plaintiff for services performed during the period from January 9, 1907, to December 31,&nbsp; 1908.&nbsp;&nbsp; Judgment&nbsp; was&nbsp; rendered in favor&nbsp; of the plaintiff and against Freeman and Whitcomb, jointly and severally, for the sum of P752 with interest at the rate of 6 per cent per annum fronrtne 27th day of August, 1909, and the&nbsp; costs of the&nbsp; cause.&nbsp; The&nbsp; complaint as to Pierce was dismissed, Whitcomb alone appealing.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWhen&nbsp; the plaintiff was&nbsp; first employed&nbsp; on&nbsp; the 9th of January, 1907, this steam laundry was owned and operated by Freeman and Pierce.&nbsp; Pierce, on the 18th of January, 1907, sold all of his right, title,&nbsp; and interest in the said laundry&nbsp; to&nbsp; Whitcomb, who,&nbsp; together&nbsp; with Freeman,&nbsp; then became the owners of this laundry and continued to operate the same as long as the plaintiff was employed.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe trial court found that the&nbsp; balance due the plaintiff for services performed amounted to the sum of P752.&nbsp;&nbsp; This finding is fully supported by the evidence&nbsp; of record.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nCounsel for the appellant&nbsp; Whitcomb now insists -<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>That the court erred in giving, jointly and severally, a&nbsp; judgment against Freeman and Whitcomb&nbsp; for&nbsp; any sum whatever; and<br \/>\r\n\t&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n\t<li>That the court erred in holding the&nbsp; appellant Whitcomb liable.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n\r\n<p>It appears from the record that Whitcomb never knew the plaintiff, never had anything&nbsp; to do with him personally, and that the&nbsp; plaintiff&#39;s contract was with Freeman, the managing partner of the&nbsp; laundry.&nbsp; It further appears from the record that Pierce, after he sold his interest in this laundry to Whitcomb, continued to look after Whitcomb&#39;s interest by authority of the latter.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nArticles 17 and 119 of the&nbsp; Code of Commerce provide:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&quot;Art.&nbsp; 17. The record in the commercial registry shall be optional&nbsp; for private merchants&nbsp; and compulsory for associations established in accordance with this code or with special laws, and for vessels.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n&quot;Art.&nbsp; 119. Every commercial association before beginning business shall&nbsp; be obliged to record its establishment, agreements, and conditions in&nbsp; a&nbsp; public instrument, which shall be&nbsp; presented for record in the commercial&nbsp; registry, in accordance with the provisions&nbsp; of article 17.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n&quot;Additional instruments which&nbsp; modify&nbsp; or&nbsp; alter in any manner whatsoever the original&nbsp; contracts of the association are subject to the same formalities, in&nbsp; accordance with the provisions of article 25.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n&quot;Partners can not make private&nbsp; agreements, but all&nbsp; must appear in the articles of co-partnership.&quot;<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>In the&nbsp; organization of this partnership by Freeman and Whitcomb the above provisions of law were&nbsp; not complied with; that is, no formal partnership was ever entered into by them,&nbsp; notwithstanding the fact that they were engaged in the operation of this laundry.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe purposes for which this partnership was entered into by Freeman and&nbsp; Whitcomb show clearly that&nbsp; such partnership was not a commercial one; hence the&nbsp; provisions of the Civil&nbsp; Code and not the Code of Commerce must govern in&nbsp; determining the liability of the partners.&nbsp; (Manresa, vol. 1, p. 184; Aramburo, Civil Capacity, 407,&nbsp; 432; Prautch <em>vs<\/em>. Hernandez, 1&nbsp; Phil&nbsp; Rep., 705; and Co Pitco <em>vs<\/em>.&nbsp; Yulo, 8 Phil. Hep., 544.)<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIn support of the second&nbsp; assignment of error our attention has been called to the cases of Hung-Man-Yoc <em>vs<\/em>. Kieng- Chiong-Seng (6 Phil. Rep., 498); Ang Quian Cieg <em>vs<\/em>. Te Chico&nbsp; (12 Phil. Rep., 533) ; Bourns<em> vs.<\/em>&nbsp; Carman&nbsp; (7 Phil. Rep., 117).&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first of these cases the partnership was a mercantile one, as it&nbsp; was engaged in the importation of goods for sale at a profit.&nbsp; This was also true in the second case.&nbsp; In neither of these cases were the&nbsp; provisions of articles 17 and 119 of the Code of Commerce complied with.&nbsp;&nbsp; Those partnerships, although&nbsp; commercial, were not&nbsp; organized in accordance with the provisions of the&nbsp; Code of&nbsp; Commerce as expressed in those articles.&nbsp;&nbsp; In determining1 the liability of the partners in these cases the court, after making the finding of facts, was governed by the provisions of article 120 of the&nbsp; Commercial&nbsp; Code.&nbsp; In the&nbsp; last case cited the partnership was one of <em> cuentas en participacion<\/em>.&nbsp; &quot;A partnership,&quot;&nbsp; quoting from the&nbsp; syllabus in&nbsp; this case, &quot; constituted in such a manner that its existence was only known to those who had&nbsp; an interest&nbsp; in the same, there being no mutual agreement between the partners, and without a corporate name indicating to&nbsp; the&nbsp; public&nbsp; in&nbsp; some way that there were other people besides the one&nbsp; who ostensibly managed and&nbsp; conducted the business, is exactly the accidental partnership of <em>cuentas&nbsp; en participacion<\/em> defined in article 239 of the Code of Commerce.&quot;<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIn a partnership of<em> cuentas en participacion,<\/em>&nbsp; under the provisions of article 242&nbsp; of the Code of Commerce, those who contract with the person in whose name the business of such&nbsp; a partnership was conducted shall have only&nbsp; the right of action against such person and not against other persons interested.&nbsp; So this case is easily distinguished from the case at bar, in that the one did not have the corporate name&nbsp; while&nbsp; the&nbsp; other was known&nbsp; as the Manila&nbsp; Steam Laundry.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe plaintiff was employed by and peformed services&nbsp; for the Manila Steam Laundry and was not employed by nor did he perform services&nbsp; for Freeman alone.&nbsp; The&nbsp; public did not deal&nbsp; with Freeman and Whitcomb personally, but with the Manila Steam Laundry.&nbsp;&nbsp; These two partners were doing&nbsp; business under this name&nbsp; and, as we have said, it was not a commercial&nbsp; partnership.&nbsp; Therefore, by the&nbsp; express provisions of articles 1698 and 1137 of the Civil Code the partners are not liable&nbsp; individually for the entire amount due the plaintiff.&nbsp;&nbsp; The liability is pro rata and in this case the appellant is responsible to the plaintiff for&nbsp; only one-half of the debt.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFor these&nbsp; reasons the&nbsp; judgment of the court below&nbsp; is reversed and judgment entered in favor of&nbsp; the plaintiff and against the defendant Whitcomb&nbsp; for the&nbsp; sum of P376, with interest as fixed&nbsp; by the court&nbsp; below.&nbsp; No&nbsp; costs will be allowed either party in this&nbsp; court.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nA motion was filed on the 22d of August, 1910, by O&#39;Brien and De Witt, asking this court to strike from the record certain allegations in the&nbsp; printed&nbsp; brief of counsel for the appellee.&nbsp; These allegations are as follows:&nbsp; &quot;Does the receipt bear the earmarks of newly discovered evidence?&nbsp; Or of newly manufactured evidence?&quot;&nbsp; These questions were directed against O&#39;Brien,&nbsp; one of the counsel&nbsp; for appellant in this case,&nbsp; and were intended to have the&nbsp; court believe that O&#39;Brien&nbsp; had manufactured&nbsp; the receipt&nbsp; referred&nbsp; to. There&nbsp; is nothing in this record which shows that O&#39;Brien did falsify or manufacture that receipt.&nbsp; These&nbsp; questions are clearly impertinent. It is our duty to keep our records&nbsp;&nbsp; clean and&nbsp; free from such unwarranted statements.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is, therefore, ordered that the same be stricken from the record.

Simplicio del Rosario.<p>On the evening of July 2, 1910,\u00a0 Rosario Aquino, an\u00a0 unmarried girl about 15 years of age, was carried away from Fort McKinley by\u00a0 Valentin Nunez\u00a0 and\u00a0 taken, according\u00a0 to her, to the house of Manuel Javier and Raymunda de la Cruz, where he succeeded in lying with her.\u00a0\u00a0 He then left her on the pretext that he would go to the office of the president or the justice of the peace so that they\u00a0 might be\u00a0 married,\u00a0 but\u00a0 as he did not return for more than an hour, the girl left the house, because she had learned from some unknown parties that women who remained therein became bad.\u00a0 She\u00a0 boarded a street car to return to this city, but the car was stopped by four municipal policemen, who told her that their sergeant wanted to talk with her. But instead of\u00a0 taking her to the town hall they conducted her to the house of the defendants, where, upon her arrival, Brigido Francisco, one of the four policemen, talked with the occupants of the house, and immediately\u00a0 the woman Raymunda de la\u00a0 Cruz invited the girl to come inside the house\u00a0 and took her into one of the rooms.\u00a0 Said house-holders picked\u00a0 up\u00a0 the petate or mat on which they had been\u00a0 lying\u00a0 and carried\u00a0 it\u00a0 into the kitchen,\u00a0 then spread another\u00a0 mat in the room, and\u00a0 the\u00a0 policeman Francisco entered and succeeded\u00a0 in lying with the girl twice in spite of her resistance.\u00a0\u00a0 On the afternoon of the next day Rosario Aquino left said house\u00a0 and went to another, where she was later\u00a0 found by her guardian, Patricio Espiritu, who reported the matter to the authorities.<\/p><p>Accordingly,\u00a0 an information was presented in the\u00a0 Court of First Instance of Rizal by the provincial fiscal charging the said Manuel\u00a0 Javier\u00a0 and Raymunda de la Cruz\u00a0 with corruption of minors.\u00a0 The case came\u00a0 to trial and the court rendered\u00a0 judgment therein on December 26,\u00a0 1910, sentencing the\u00a0 defendants to two years of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">prision correctional<\/span>, with the accessories, each to pay half of the\u00a0 costs. From this judgment they appealed.<\/p><p>Article 444 of the Penal Code prescribes:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"Whosoever shall habitually, or, taking advantage of his authority or of another's trust, promote or facilitate the prostitution or corruption of minors to satisfy the lusts of another, shall be punished with the penalty of <em>prision correccional<\/em> in its minimum and medium degrees, and temporary absolute disqualification if he were\u00a0 an authority.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>From\u00a0 the foregoing article it appears that the practice or repetition of the acts of promoting or facilitating prostitution is the first and most general condition required by the penal law to establish the commission\u00a0 of the\u00a0 crime provided for and penalized in said article.<\/p><p>So, the execution of a single act of facilitating the prostitution\u00a0 of a\u00a0 minor,\u00a0 by placing her at another's disposal for immoral purposes, does not legally constitute the said crime, unless it was done with abuse of authority or\u00a0 abuse of trust\u00a0 on the part of the person who promotes or\u00a0 facilitates\u00a0 the commission of\u00a0 such immoral act, in which two cases the execution of a\u00a0 single act is alone sufficient to make its perpetrator liable under\u00a0 said article.<\/p><p>It is impossible to determine exactly, from the conflicting and\u00a0 at times contradiptory statements\u00a0 of the offended party, Rosario Aquino, whether the\u00a0 house to which\u00a0 she was conducted\u00a0 by Valentin Nunez on that\u00a0 night of the second of July and which she later left, is the same as that to which she\u00a0 was again\u00a0 conducted by Brigido Francisco, who slept with her therein; in order to establish\u00a0 the guilt of the defendants as corruptors\u00a0 it is indispensable that complete proof appear in\u00a0 the case, not only\u00a0 of the presence and stay of said girl\u00a0 in the defendants' house for immoral purposes but also of similar acts repeated in\u00a0 said\u00a0 house in such\u00a0 a manner that\u00a0 it may be affirmed that the alleged perpetrators made a practice of such repulsive crime.\u00a0 The case affords no evidence\u00a0 that such conduct\u00a0 was habitual with the defendants, for an immoral act committed in their house\u00a0 and with their consent by\u00a0 a third person\u00a0 does\u00a0 not constitute habit or repetition of such acts on their part.<\/p><p>Neither does the case reveal that there was, on the part of said defendants, any abuse of authority, or any abuse of trust\u00a0 that the girl or her guardian\u00a0 might have reposed in them,\u00a0 for it does not appear that the offended\u00a0 girl and the defendants had been previously acquainted.\u00a0 Had there been abuse\u00a0 of trust, one\u00a0 single act\u00a0 executed to facilitate the prostitution\u00a0 or corruption of said minor would have been sufficient to establish the existence of the crime and the guilt of the defendants, according to the principle laid down\u00a0 by the\u00a0 supreme court of Spain in connection with article 459\u00a0 of the Penal\u00a0 Code of\u00a0 that country, which is identical with\u00a0 444 of the Code in force in these Islands, in\u00a0 its\u00a0 judgment of May 8, 1888.<\/p><p>For these reasons, and as the facts in the case at bar do not constitute a crime,\u00a0 we believe that the judgment should be reversed and Manuel Javier and Raymunda\u00a0 de la Cruz acquitted, with the costs in both instances <em>de oficio<\/em>.

Albert\u00a0 E. McCabe presiding, condemning the defendant, Quintin Mondejar, for the crime of robbery with wounds, to ten years and one day of presidio mayor, to indemnify the offended party, Chiong Uco, in the sum of P200, and to pay the costs.<br\/><br\/>On the afternoon of the 18th of June, 1910, while Chiong Uco, who was then a merchant and residing within the jurisdiction of the town of Cadiz, Province of Occidental Negros, was returning from the town of Sagay to Cadiz, he met, in an uninhabited place, the defendant and spoke to him\u00a0 in a friendly manner without stopping.\u00a0 Just after the defendant had passed the Chinaman, he, the defendant, suddenly, and without warning, attacked the Chinaman from behind with a bolo, inflicting upon his head\u00a0 a terrific wound, over five inches in length, extending over the back of the neck, around to and upon the right jaw.\u00a0 On receiving this blow the Chinaman turned around and said\u00a0 to\u00a0 the defendant: \"Quintin, do not kill me; if it is money you want, I will give it to you.\"\u00a0 The defendant paid no attention to this request, but struck the Chinaman two other\u00a0 blows\u00a0 upon the head, knocking him down, where he remained for several minutes in an unconscious condition.\u00a0 When the Chinaman regained consciousness he found that the P200 which he\u00a0 had in his possession had disappeared. No one else was present nor saw this crime committed.<br\/><br\/>Apparently counsel for the defendant is of the opinion that under the doctrine laid down by this court\u00a0 in the cases of U.S. <i>vs.<\/i> Cabe (1 Phil. Rep., 265) and U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Asiao (1 Phil. Rep., 304), the uncorroborated testimony of one witness as to the identity\u00a0 of an accused person is not sufficient upon which to base a conviction.\u00a0 In the first case above-cited the court said, at page 266:<br\/><blockquote>\"The fact that only one witness testified is not an obstacle to our becoming fully convinced as to the certainty\u00a0 of the occurrence\u00a0 and of the guilt of the defendants, because, in addition to\u00a0 the testimony of this witness we find grave and conclusive circumstantial evidence, based upon proven facts, such as the sequestration of the deceased and of the witnesses Daniel Gascon and Sotero Alquero\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>And in the second case the court enunciated this doctrine (reading from syllabus):<br\/><blockquote>\"The presumption of innocence will prevent the conviction of accused\u00a0 upon the uncorroborated identification of one witness\u00a0 whose statements are discredited\u00a0 by\u00a0 the\u00a0 circumstances or\u00a0 by\u00a0 contradictions.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In neither of these cases did the court say that the uncorroborated testimony of one credible witness it not sufficient upon\u00a0 which to\u00a0 base a\u00a0 conviction.\u00a0\u00a0 The testimony of one witness\u00a0 is\u00a0 sufficient for this purpose,\u00a0 if\u00a0 such\u00a0 testimony convinces the court beyond a reasonable\u00a0 doubt that the accused committed the\u00a0 crime charged.<br\/><br\/>The offended party in the case at bar was well acquainted with the defendant.\u00a0 When he met him on that day he\u00a0 spoke to him, calling him\u00a0 by\u00a0 name, and after receiving the first blow he again addressed him in a familiar manner, saying: \"Quintin, do not kill me.\"\u00a0\u00a0 The Chinaman went before the justice of the peace on that same afternoon and charged the defendant with\u00a0 this\u00a0 crime,\u00a0\u00a0 The testimony of the injured party throughout the entire proceedings\u00a0 is direct and positive, clear and\u00a0 conclusive,\u00a0 free from contradictions, and establishes the guilt\u00a0 of the defendant beyond peradventure of a doubt.<br\/><br\/>The crime committed by the defendant is that defined and penalized under paragraph 4, article 503 of the Penal Code, in relation with\u00a0 article 502 and paragraph 4 of article 416 of the same code.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is, therefore, affirmed: Provided, however, That the penalty be and the same is hereby fixed at fourteen years and eight months' <i>cadena\u00a0 temporal<\/i>.

That the defendants have not proved to the satisfaction of this court the facts alleged in their complaint and counterclaim.<br\/><br\/>\"As a\u00a0 conclusion of law\u00a0 the court finds that the plaintiff has a right to obtain from the defendants one-half of the products of said lands received by the said\u00a0 defendants from the said tenants, and likewise the plaintiff has the right to receive the other half of said products from the defendants on account of the debt of the\u00a0 defendants in\u00a0 favor of\u00a0 the plaintiff, which amounts to P5,062.72; and it not having been determined in the document Exhibit\u00a0 A in what form the delivery of this one-half of the products to the plaintiff should be made, the court is of the opinion\u00a0 that it should be sold by the defendant at the price current in the market, and that the amount received from such\u00a0 sale should be delivered to the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>\"The court further finds that\u00a0 the defendants should be condemned to the payment of the costs.\u00a0\u00a0 Let\u00a0 judgment be entered accordingly.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>From this\u00a0 decision the defendants appealed.<br\/><br\/>All agree\u00a0 that the lands mentioned in the second clause of the above contract consist of seven parcels.\u00a0 The plaintiff contends\u00a0 that of these seven parcels sold by him to the\u00a0 defendants, two were\u00a0 his own property and the\u00a0 other five were lands mortgaged to\u00a0 him\u00a0 by\u00a0 Margarita Concepcion; while the defendants insist\u00a0 that the\u00a0 lands mortgaged to the plaintiff\u00a0 by\u00a0\u00a0 Margarita\u00a0 Concepcion were\u00a0 not included in the sale,\u00a0 and that\u00a0 on\u00a0 the\u00a0 execution\u00a0 of this\u00a0 contract the plaintiff turned over to them only three of the seven parcels\u00a0 purchased.\u00a0 The trial court found that the defendants failed to prove\u00a0 that the lands mortgaged by Concepcion\u00a0 to the plaintiff were not included in this sale.\u00a0 We think this finding of fact is plainly and manifestly against the weight\u00a0 of the\u00a0 evidence.\u00a0 Neither the number of parcels nor their description appear in\u00a0 the\u00a0 contract.\u00a0 The only thing given is the purchase price, P2,000.<br\/><br\/>German Godinez, son of Margarita Concepcion, died sometime prior to March,\u00a0 1901.\u00a0 At the time of his death he was indebted to the plaintiff in the sum\u00a0 of Pl,029.\u00a0 His mother, being the only heir, assumed payment of this debt and executed on March 1, 1901,\u00a0 plaintiff's Exhibit B, mortgaging to the plaintiff two parcels of land, one in the barrio of Malalay and the other in the barrio of Bulac, and sixteen carabaos.\u00a0\u00a0 The defendant, Godinez,\u00a0 who is a grandson of Margarita Concepcion, was, by agreement, placed in charge of these two parcels of land.\u00a0 The plaintiff was to receive all of the products from these lands which came into the possession of Godinez from his\u00a0 tenants,\u00a0 one-half of said amount in lieu of interest and the other half to be applied\u00a0 on the payment, of the\u00a0 Pl,029. Godinez is still in possession. The debt was\u00a0 not\u00a0 paid, but its payment was assumed by the defendants and included in the\u00a0 P5,062.72.\u00a0 The document Exhibit B which\u00a0 was presented by the\u00a0 plaintiff himself shows\u00a0 conclusively that Margarita Concepcion mortgaged to him two parcels only, and not five.\u00a0 If these two parcels had been\u00a0 included\u00a0 in\u00a0 those purchased\u00a0 by the defendants they would have paid the German Godinez debt twice, inasmuch as it has been shown, as we have said, that the latter debt was included in the contract of March 5.<br\/><br\/>The defendants received three of the seven parcels of land bought from the plaintiff.\u00a0\u00a0 They are entitled to the possession of the other four.\u00a0 Three of the four are in the\u00a0 barrio of Bulac and are described as follows: The first is bounded on the north by lands\u00a0 of Felix Torres, south by Benedicto Sambrano, east by Gregorio\u00a0 Bamisa and on the west by Placido Rivero; the second parcel is bounded on the north by Placido\u00a0 Camaso, south by Victorino Sibay, east by Luciano Gomez and on the west by Placido Camaso; the third parcel is bounded on the north by Carlos Asiong, south by Feliciano Taytay, east by Juan Redilla and on the west by Juan Boiser.<br\/><br\/>The fourth parcel is in the barrio of Malalay.\u00a0 Its boundaries are not specifically stated, but its superficial\u00a0 area is 5<i> gantas\u00a0 de siembra<\/i>.\u00a0 The plaintiff admitted that he now possesses one parcel in this barrio, and the defendant swore positively that this was one of the seven parcels purchased.<br\/><br\/>In the second clause of the contract the defendant says: <br\/>\"My part\u00a0 (of the products)\u00a0 from\u00a0 all of my tenants is to be divided into equal parts between Mr. Noel and myself, my share is to be paid to Mr. Noel little\u00a0 by little, to be applied on payment of my indebtedness.\"\u00a0\u00a0 That the plaintiff was to receive all the defendants' share of the products from said lands,\u00a0 one-half in\u00a0 lieu of interest and the other half to be applied on payment of the principal debt, there is no dispute.\u00a0\u00a0 The plaintiff contends, however, that he was not only to receive such products from the lands which he sold the defendants, but also from the lands which they owned or possessed prior to the execution of the contract; while the defendants insist that the products\u00a0 from the lands which they owned prior to the 5th of March were not to be included in this part of the contract.\u00a0\u00a0 The terms of the contract on this point are not clear.\u00a0 The defendants purchased certain lands from the plaintiff in the barrios of Malalay and Bulac for which they agreed to pay P2,000.\u00a0 This\u00a0 fact appears in the last clause of the contract and immediately follows the defendants'\u00a0 expression - \"from\u00a0 all of\u00a0 my tenants.\"\u00a0 This expression being somewhat\u00a0 ambiguous, the parties were allowed to present oral testimony for the purpose of clarifying this point, and this oral testimony, considered\u00a0 together with the terms of the contract, clearly shows that the defendants' position is the correct one.<br\/><br\/>The trial\u00a0 court found that the defendants received\u00a0 as their part of the harvest for the year 1907, 400 <i>cavanes<\/i> of corn and 30 <i>quintales <\/i>of tobacco.\u00a0 The only testimony which supports this finding of fact is that of one Mariano MontaJvo who testified that the plaintiff\u00a0 should have received these amounts.\u00a0\u00a0 This\u00a0 witness\u00a0 went\u00a0 to the camarines of\u00a0 the defendants and saw a quantity\u00a0 of corn and tobacco stored therein.\u00a0\u00a0 He did not measure the\u00a0 corn nor\u00a0 weigh\u00a0 the tobacco.\u00a0\u00a0 He was in\u00a0 the <i>camarines<\/i>\u00a0 but once\u00a0 and then for about two hours only.\u00a0\u00a0 The best\u00a0 he could do was to give an estimate of the amount of these products.\u00a0 At the time this witness was in the\u00a0 camarines there was deposited therein not only the products which the defendants received from the three parcels of land purchased from the plaintiff, but also the products from their other lands.\u00a0 He did not know on\u00a0 what lands this\u00a0 corn\u00a0 and\u00a0 tobacco were grown; while,\u00a0 on the other hand,\u00a0 Godinez and the two witnesses who guarded these camarines establish the fact that there was nothing like 400 <i>cavanes<\/i> of corn and 30 <i>quintales<\/i>\u00a0 of tobacco in said <i>camarines.<\/i>\u00a0 A part of this corn and tobacco had\u00a0 been\u00a0 grown upon the lands of the\u00a0 defendants which were not purchased from the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>Both parties must\u00a0 comply with their respective obligations as stated in the contract and as clarified by the oral testimony, the\u00a0 plaintiff by turning over to the defendants the other\u00a0 four parcels of land, as above described, and the defendants, immediately\u00a0 after receiving from their tenants their share of the products from these\u00a0 seven\u00a0 parcels\u00a0 of land, by turning over to the plaintiff, in\u00a0 kind, one-half\u00a0 of such products\u00a0 in lieu of\u00a0 interest, and\u00a0 selling the other half and\u00a0 applying the\u00a0 money\u00a0 as part\u00a0 payment of the principal debt.\u00a0\u00a0 The defendants must account to the plaintiff in this same manner for their share of the products of the three parcels\u00a0 from the\u00a0 time\u00a0 they took\u00a0 possession of said parcels in March, 1907.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons the judgment appealed from is hereby reversed and judgment will be entered in accordance\u00a0 with\u00a0 this\u00a0 decision.\u00a0\u00a0 No\u00a0 special ruling as to costs.

Julio Llorente presiding, convicting the appellant of\u00a0 robbery and sentencing him to\u00a0 three years and nine months\u00a0 of <i>presidio correccional<\/i>, to\u00a0 the\u00a0 accessories provided by\u00a0 law,\u00a0 and to the payment of the costs of the trial.<br\/><br\/>It appears that\u00a0 on\u00a0 or about the 3d or 4th\u00a0 day of July, 1907, between\u00a0 8 and 10 o'clock of the\u00a0 night, two persons, one armed with a gun, forcibly took from\u00a0 the possession of one\u00a0 Miguel\u00a0 Lagamia a\u00a0 carabao belonging\u00a0 to his employer,\u00a0 Felix Atacador.\u00a0\u00a0 They not only took\u00a0 the carabao but compelled\u00a0 said Miguel Lagamia to accompany\u00a0 them as far as a <i>talajal<\/i> where they liberated him.\u00a0\u00a0 On or about the 4th day of September of\u00a0 the\u00a0 same year\u00a0 the carabao above mentioned was found in the possession of Leoncio San Gabriel, a cropper in the employ of the accused Bonifacio\u00a0 Divino, who\u00a0 stated that the carabao had been\u00a0 delivered to him by the said accused to be used in the work to be performed by said Leoncio San Gabriel upon the lands of the said\u00a0 accused.\u00a0 Leoncio San Gabriel\u00a0 having possession of the carabao without the documents of title required by law, and the accused\u00a0 not having\u00a0 said documents, said carabao, with three others\u00a0 also\u00a0 at the\u00a0 same time in\u00a0 the possession of the accused without the corresponding\u00a0 evidences of title, was taken by the provincial officials.\u00a0 While the said carabao was being used in\u00a0 public work by\u00a0 the provincial government\u00a0 pending\u00a0 its\u00a0 identification\u00a0 by\u00a0 the owner, it was recognized by Felix Atacador, the man from whose servant it had been forcibly taken by the robbers. Upon recognizing the carabao, Atacador presented the documents justifying his claim\u00a0 of ownership\u00a0 and after\u00a0 due comparison\u00a0 of the marks upon the carabao with those in the documents presented,\u00a0 the provincial governor delivered the carabao to Atacador.\u00a0 The owner recognized the carabao in question not only from the brands which appeared upon\u00a0 it but\u00a0 also from certain natural physical peculiarities which the carabao\u00a0 presented.\u00a0 As a witness Atacador fully identified\u00a0 the\u00a0 carabao not only\u00a0 from its brand\u00a0 but also from\u00a0 said natural\u00a0 physical peculiarities, and had no hesitation in asserting positively and\u00a0 without equivocation that the carabao in question was the one of which his servant, Miguel Lagamia, had been forcibly\u00a0 robbed. The identity of the carabao found in possession of the government with that\u00a0 of which Atacador had\u00a0 been robbed was\u00a0 clearly\u00a0 and fully\u00a0 established by several other witnesses, among them the provincial governor,\u00a0 Sr. Tinio,\u00a0 who testified that at the time Atacador\u00a0 presented\u00a0 his claim to the carabao then in the possession of the provincial government, he had carefully\u00a0 compared the marks in the documents presented by Atacador with those upon the carabao and\u00a0 that he entertained not the slightest doubt that the marks were identical. No direct denial was made by the defendant or his witnesses of the identity of the carabao in question with the carabao found in the possession of the provincial government and that lost by Atacador.\u00a0 The only question presented by the evidence of defendant's witnesses is one over the identity of the marks\u00a0 appearing in the documents of ownership of Atacador and those appearing: upon the carabao.\u00a0 All of these witnesses, however, admit the identity of the private marks.\u00a0 The only\u00a0 mark in\u00a0 controversy is the municipal\u00a0 mark.\u00a0 Two\u00a0 of the\u00a0 witnesses seemed\u00a0 to assert that\u00a0 at the time\u00a0 the\u00a0 carabao was taken from the possession of the accused and turned over to the provincial government the municipal\u00a0 mark\u00a0 upon\u00a0 the carabao was wanting1.\u00a0 The testimony of these\u00a0 witnesses, however, was not positive, and,\u00a0 in our judgment, does not deserve the consideration\u00a0 which the learned\u00a0 trial\u00a0 court\u00a0 gave to the positive and direct testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution.\u00a0 These witnesses unhesitatingly assert that at the time the carabao came into the\u00a0 possession of the provincial government it had upon its body not only the private mark of Atacador but the municipal mark of Batangas.<br\/><br\/>While the persons who committed the robbery were not recognized\u00a0 and their identity is entirely unknown, nevertheless, the accused, having been found in possession\u00a0 of the stolen\u00a0 carabao shortly after\u00a0 the commission of the crime, without the documents necessary under the law to justify ownership and\u00a0 possession,\u00a0 and he not having made the slightest explanation as to that possession, his conviction under the evidence presented in this case is justified by law.\u00a0 (U.\u00a0 S.<i> vs.<\/i>\u00a0 Soriano, 9 Phil.

Hurd.<p>On the night of the 18th until the early morning of the 19th of May,\u00a0 1910,\u00a0 Elena Llanera was asleep in\u00a0 her house situated in the pueblo of Aliaga, Nueva Ecija, her husband, Emilio Soriano, being at the time absent in this city; she was sleeping under\u00a0 a mosquito netting in the parlor of the house with her three minor children and the women Damiana Collado and Elena\u00a0 Molina,\u00a0 and in the dining room\u00a0 of the said\u00a0 house the men named Cenon and Luis\u00a0 Pascual,\u00a0 with their respective wives, were also asleep.\u00a0\u00a0 At about 4 o'clock in the morning Llanera was awakened by the noise produced on the floor by a man's steps, in the\u00a0 direction of her feet; she therefore awoke Damiana and,\u00a0 on raising one of the sides of the mosquito\u00a0 netting, they saw\u00a0 and recognized Faustino Mesina, for there was then a light in the house; the latter hurriedly went into another room followed by the three women who then saw the said party go out of the window, which on that occasion was\u00a0 open, and from\u00a0 there alight on the ground by supporting himself upon a window of the ground floor.\u00a0 The inmates of the house testified that before going to bed\u00a0 that night they had\u00a0 closed all the windows and doors of the house.<\/p><p>The provincial fiscal, therefore, on September\u00a0 22,\u00a0 1910, filed an information with\u00a0 the\u00a0 Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija, charging Faustino Mesina with the crime of forcible entry,\u00a0 and,\u00a0 this cause having been instituted, the court in view of the evidence and on\u00a0 the 23d of November following rendered judgment by sentencing the defendant to the penalty of four months of <em>arresto mayor,<\/em> to pay a fine of\u00a0 500\u00a0 pesetas, with subsidiary\u00a0 imprisonment in case\u00a0 of insolvency, and the costs.\u00a0\u00a0 From this\u00a0 judgment the defendant appealed.<\/p><p>The facts related, duly proved in this cause, certainly constitute the crime of\u00a0 forcible entry, performed without violence or intimidation, provided for and punished in article 491, paragraph 1, of the Penal Code, inasmuch as, from the testimony of three eyewitnesses, it was\u00a0 fully proven\u00a0 that, on the owner of the house,\u00a0 Elena Llanera, being awakened, early in the morning of the 19th of\u00a0 May, by the\u00a0 sound\u00a0 of the steps of a person who was walking inside of the house near her bed which\u00a0 was covered with a mosquito netting, both she and her companions who were\u00a0 sleeping\u00a0 with her under the same netting on raising one side of the same saw and recognized the said person, by the light there was in the house, as being the defendant, Faustino Mesina, who, on observing that the said women had awakened and had\u00a0 seen him, immediately and hastily entered\u00a0 the\u00a0 small room of the house, followed by them, and went down out of the building through one of the windows of the said room, which at that moment was open,\u00a0 by supporting himself on\u00a0 a window of the entresol, located thereunder, which must have been the way he got in, for the inmates of the house had closed that room window and\u00a0 all the others in the house the\u00a0 night previous before retiring.<\/p><p>The defendant's\u00a0 denial,\u00a0 his exculpatory allegations and the testimony of his witnesses were unsuccessful in\u00a0 overthrowing the very positive evidence\u00a0 of the prosecution, for his allegation that he was at\u00a0 the said house on the morning of the day aforementioned, for the purpose of\u00a0 making some requests to the husband of the offended woman, Elena Llanera, who, as she was in\u00a0 the granary nearby,\u00a0 had\u00a0 to be called and on arriving at her house\u00a0 he\u00a0 had\u00a0 a\u00a0 long conversation with\u00a0 her and not\u00a0 until after she\u00a0 had\u00a0 had her breakfast did he leave for the\u00a0 sitio of Bibiclat,\u00a0 was not corroborated by the testimony of his two witnesses, Buenaventura\u00a0 Maligsi and\u00a0 Eusebio Landieho, the first of whom testified\u00a0 that he was engaged that morning in hauling rice to the warehouse of\u00a0 Elena Llanera, who was then\u00a0 inside of this building, and\u00a0 the second\u00a0 witness, that\u00a0 he\u00a0 was near the warehouse waiting for his neighbor named Julio; they then\u00a0 saw the defendant enter the\u00a0 house of\u00a0 the\u00a0 offended party and after a short while, during\u00a0 which the latter, called by a little girl, returned to the house, these witnesses saw the defendant come down out of the house.\u00a0 This testimony, far from proving the defendant's statements, completely disproves them and belies the fact affirmed by\u00a0 Mesina relative to the long conversation; besides, the offended party denied that the\u00a0 defendant was in her\u00a0 house that morning.<\/p><p>Moreover, the testimony\u00a0 of the municipal\u00a0 policeman, Timoteo Palis,\u00a0 corroborates the evidence of the prosecution. This witness testified that\u00a0 while he\u00a0 was\u00a0 on\u00a0 guard duty at the municipal building a short\u00a0 while before\u00a0 4 o'clock on the morning of the said date, the defendant\u00a0 passed by and advised him that the\u00a0 policemen should be ready who\u00a0 were to accompany him, Mesina,\u00a0 to the sitio of Bibiclat, and that the defendant immediately left and witness\u00a0 did not know where the latter went.\u00a0\u00a0 This testimony, combined with that of the offended party and her two witnesses, and all taken as a whole, produce in the mind a thorough conviction that the defendant did commit the\u00a0 crime under prosecution.\u00a0 It is to be presumed that after passing\u00a0 by the municipal building the defendant went to the house where the crime was committed and climbed up into it through the\u00a0 window, for this was not very high up.<\/p><p>For the reasons stated, the\u00a0 testimony\u00a0 of the wife of the defendant can not be considered as\u00a0 proof of an alibi in his behalf, to the\u00a0 effect that at the hour and on the date mentioned her husband was in his house and that Elena\u00a0 Llanera, subsequent to the denunciation of the\u00a0 crime, had talked with her in order that she might\u00a0 feel no\u00a0 resentment - inasmuch as such\u00a0 statements were not proved and the\u00a0 offended party denied that she\u00a0 had\u00a0 had any conversation whatever with Marcelina Santiago, the defendant's wife.<\/p><p>Article 491, aforecited, provides that any private person who shall enter the dwelling of another against the latter's will shall incur the penalty specified therein, and although the inmates of the house did\u00a0 not forbid the defendant to enter the same, nevertheless and withal when one enters a house by climbing\u00a0 up into it and passing through\u00a0 a window thereof which had been closed and was opened by the perpetrator of the crime for\u00a0 the purpose of his entry, even though no violence was\u00a0 employed\u00a0 in doing\u00a0 so, it is unquestionable that the entry into the\u00a0 house,\u00a0 by taking advantage of the darkness and when all the inmates thereof were asleep, bears the character of the\u00a0 crime of\u00a0 forcible entry, for the\u00a0 reason that,\u00a0 under such circumstances, it is not necessary that there should have been a previous prohibition to enter by the inmates, since this is presumed, and because the\u00a0 entry into the premises was effected against the\u00a0 will of the occupants thereof, there being no proof that the\u00a0 defendant\u00a0 entered the same with the\u00a0 permission or the consent of any of them.<\/p><p>In the commission of the crime there is no extenuating circumstance\u00a0 whatever to be considered, but there\u00a0 is the aggravating one of nocturnity,\u00a0 since the defendant perpetrated the crime by taking advantage\u00a0 of\u00a0 the silence\u00a0 and darkness of the night: therefore, the\u00a0 penalty fixed by law of <em>arresto\u00a0 mayor<\/em> should be imposed upon him in its maximum degree.<\/p><p>For the foregoing reasons it is our opinion\u00a0 that the judgment\u00a0 appealed\u00a0 from\u00a0 should\u00a0 be affirmed;\u00a0 provided, however, that the\u00a0 defendant shall be sentenced to the penalty of five\u00a0 months of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">arresto mayor, <\/span>to the other penalties of the judgment of the lower court, and to\u00a0 the costs of this instance.

Later a motion was made by the plaintiff for a new trial upon the ground of newly discovered evidence.\u00a0\u00a0 Still later the plaintiff made\u00a0 a motion\u00a0 for\u00a0 a new\u00a0 trial on\u00a0 the\u00a0 ground that its consent to the entry of the judgments\u00a0 in question had been given under a mistake.\u00a0\u00a0 These motions\u00a0 having been denied the plaintiff excepted and\u00a0 comes to this court on appeal.<\/p><p>We regard this appeal\u00a0 from the\u00a0 judgment as\u00a0 unsustainable.\u00a0 In our opinion the judgment entered\u00a0 in the court below was\u00a0 one\u00a0 entered by consent\u00a0 of\u00a0 parties.\u00a0\u00a0 That portion of the judgment of the trial\u00a0 court affecting this particular point is as follows:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"By\u00a0 agreement between the parties, and with the consent of the court, the hearing on the report in this case was held on the 19th day of January, 1910.\u00a0 Don Antonio Constantino appeared on behalf of the plaintiff,\u00a0 Mr. James Ostrand on behalf of defendants\u00a0 (naming them) and Don Mariano Legaspi for the other defendants, with the exception of the Insular Government and Carlos Villamil.\u00a0 The latter on the 14th day of the month of January presented a motion\u00a0 in\u00a0 which\u00a0 he stated that he was in\u00a0 entire conformity with\u00a0 the report\u00a0 of the\u00a0 commission presented to the court.\u00a0 The Insular Government did not appear at all in this case.<\/p><\/blockquote><p align=\"center\">*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<\/p><blockquote><p>\"The report of the commissioners which appears in the record of this case is the only proof presented before me, and there being no opposition to said report, and the court being of the opinion that the same is correct, and\u00a0 that the valuations therein\u00a0 set forth and expressed are just and equitable, the same\u00a0 ought to\u00a0 be,\u00a0 and is hereby, approved and affirmed.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>In his denial of the motion for a new trial and that to reopen the judgment for the reason that the consent of the plaintiff had been given by mistake, the court said\u00a0 in part:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"The attorneys for both parties having presented as the only proofs in the case the report of the commissioners, and having\u00a0 accepted it as correct, and having prayed for\u00a0 its approval by the court, and having moved the court to enter judgment in\u00a0 conformity therewith.\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 * the motion is dismissed.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>These facts stated by the court below in its final judgment and\u00a0 in\u00a0 its order denying\u00a0 the motions referred\u00a0 to stand uncontradicted in the record.\u00a0 It is\u00a0 undisputed that the parties to these cases duly appeared by their counsel and after consideration and deliberation consented to the entry of judgment\u00a0 upon the report of the commissioners.

FILEMON\nMENDEZ, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/>\n<br\/>\nD E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>CARSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">The accused in this case\u00a0 was charged with the crime of <i>tentativa de violacion <\/i>(attempted rape), and convicted in the court below of\u00a0 the\u00a0 crime of <i>abusos deshonestos<\/i> (abuse of chastity).<br\/><br\/>The story of the complaining witness and her sister, on which alone the prosecution relies\u00a0 and on which the trial judge based his judgment of conviction, is substantially; as\u00a0 follows: That Bonifacia\u00a0 Lomio,\u00a0 a\u00a0 married woman,\u00a0 was asleep in the single sleeping room in her house, together with her sister Marcelina, a grown Woman, and her infant children; that\u00a0 Bonifacia suddenly awoke to find\u00a0 herself in the arms of the accused, who had gained entrance to the house by climbing\u00a0 through a\u00a0 window; that while taking indecent liberties with\u00a0 her\u00a0 person,\u00a0 he endeavored to force her; that in the struggle which ensued, the assaulted woman cried aloud for aid, and awakened her sister\u00a0 Marcelina, who lit the lamp and the struggle still continuing, went to the assistance of her sister, and helped her to free herself from her assailant;\u00a0 that Marcelina, at the request\u00a0 of her sister,\u00a0 then went for the aid of the police; and\u00a0 that when she\u00a0 returned\u00a0 with a policeman, they\u00a0 found the accused still\u00a0 seated in the room begging the forgiveness of Bonifacia for what he had done.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 accused admitted that he had climbed into the house of the complaining\u00a0 witness through a window and was found\u00a0 in the sleeping room at the time indicated by her; but\u00a0 insisted that he had done so\u00a0 at the invitation\u00a0 of her unmarried sister, Marcelina, with whom at that time and for some months prior thereto he had had amorous relations; that on that\u00a0 occasion,\u00a0 as\u00a0 on other\u00a0 similar occasions, he spent some time with Marcelina;\u00a0 that, unfortunately for him, the noise of their conversation awakened the older sister,\u00a0 who made an\u00a0 outcry and began abusing the younger sister\u00a0 for\u00a0 her misconduct; that\u00a0 a dispute arose between himself and Bonifacia, who ordered her younger sister to go out and fetch the police; that feeling himself guiltless of any crime, other\u00a0 than that of his clandestine relations with the\u00a0 younger sister, he made no\u00a0 attempt\u00a0 to escape; that when the policeman arrived.he was\u00a0 arrested on the false complaint of the older sister that he had\u00a0 attempted to rape her.<br\/><br\/>Both the sisters denied any acquaintance with the accused, and\u00a0 only under strict cross-examination\u00a0 did they\u00a0 reluctantly admit\u00a0 that he lived\u00a0 in the same village with them,\u00a0 in the house\u00a0 just opposite\u00a0 their\u00a0 own, where they kept a small store, and that they knew him by sight; though they insisted that they never had spoken\u00a0 to him before the night in question.<br\/><br\/>The accused called several witnesses\u00a0 who testified to the friendly\u00a0 relations between the younger sister and himself for several months prior to the night in question, and one of these witnesses corroborated his testimony as to his entry at night, through the window of the house where the sisters, lived, on more than one occasion\u00a0 prior to\u00a0 his arrest.\u00a0 The testimony of these witnesses, however, is not very satisfactory, and were the story told by the\u00a0 sisters\u00a0 a\u00a0 consistent and satisfactory one,\u00a0 would not be sufficient to overcome their testimony.<br\/><br\/>We are unable to accept as true their story that this accused, uninvited, entered their house as they\u00a0 allege, with the purpose and intent of forcibly violating one of the two sisters, whom\u00a0 he must have\u00a0 known were sleeping in\u00a0 the same room, in the absence of proof that, aflame with passion and utterly regardless of\u00a0 consequences, he had resolved to accomplish his purpose despite the resistance of his victim, and ready if necessary to use such violence as he must have known\u00a0 his\u00a0 act\u00a0 would require in\u00a0 order to dispose of\u00a0 the assistance one sister would render the other, and which the outcries of both the sisters, when thus attacked, would inevitably bring from neighboring cottages.\u00a0 As\u00a0 he well knew,\u00a0 the\u00a0 slightest outcry from\u00a0 the\u00a0 nipa cottage where the incident occurred would\u00a0 have aroused\u00a0 the\u00a0 neighbors all around, and it would indeed have been a bold\u00a0 and reckless criminal who\u00a0 would deliberately enter\u00a0 it,\u00a0 and\u00a0 attempt by force to violate or wickedly assault one of two grown women sleeping in the same apartment, even if he were prepared to silence them by the use of such threats and violence as would be necessary to keep them quiet\u00a0 under such circumstances.<br\/><br\/>There is\u00a0 nothing whatever in\u00a0 the story\u00a0 of the sisters which even\u00a0 suggests that this was the kind of\u00a0 a man who made the alleged assault upon their house;\u00a0 on the contrary, his conduct\u00a0 throughout the\u00a0 whole\u00a0 incident\u00a0 is wholly inconsistent with the idea that he came there prepared for any such desperate deed as he must have known to have been involved in an\u00a0 attempt forcibly to violate either one of the women.<br\/><br\/>We think his story of what occurred by far\u00a0 the more plausible one,\u00a0 accounting for its one inconsistency - the bringing of the policeman by the younger sister despite the fact the accused, as he alleges, had come to the house at her invitation - by treating it as but another instance where a woman has deserted and turned upon her lover, rather than face the consequences of an honest confession of her illicit relations with him.<br\/><br\/>Giving the accused the\u00a0 benefit of the doubt to which he is entitled, we are forced to conclude that the sisters have not told\u00a0 the whole truth as\u00a0 to\u00a0 what\u00a0 occurred, and\u00a0 that whatever did occur which resulted in the calling of the policeman and\u00a0 the arrest of\u00a0 the accused, it was not an attempt on\u00a0 his\u00a0 part to forcibly violate the complaining witness as charged in the complaint, or to \"lewdly offend\" her by laying violent and indecent hands upon her (<i>abusos deshonestos<\/i>) as found by the\u00a0 trial\u00a0 judge.<br\/><br\/>Before dismissing this case we think it proper to direct the attention of the prosecuting officers and the trial court to the vital importance, especially in cases such as this, of producing all the witnesses whose testimony there is sound reason to believe may\u00a0 be of value in developing the truth of\u00a0 the matters under\u00a0 investigation, or\u00a0 of\u00a0 satisfactorily accounting\u00a0 for\u00a0 the failure to\u00a0 produce\u00a0 them, either\u00a0 by a showing of inability to secure\u00a0 their presence at the trial, or of known hostility and the fact that it is expected that they will be called for the defense, or the like.\u00a0 In this case the\u00a0 policeman who arrested the accused\u00a0 was\u00a0 not\u00a0 called to the stand, nor is there any explanation in the record for the failure of the prosecution\u00a0 to\u00a0 produce him - and yet it must have been apparent to the prosecuting officer, as well as to the trial court, that his evidence could\u00a0 hardly\u00a0 fail to have been of vital importance in\u00a0 any attempt to sift out the truth from the story told by the complaining witness and her sister.\u00a0 If he proved to be an intelligent and observant man, his testimony as\u00a0 to the conditions existing when he made the arrest, had he been\u00a0 called to\u00a0 the witness stand, could hardly have failed to shed a flood of light on the doubt upon which the judgment in this case\u00a0 turns; and in any event,\u00a0 the unexplained failure\u00a0 of the prosecution to\u00a0 put him on the stand, necessarily weakens the case made\u00a0 out by the prosecution.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of conviction and the sentence based thereon must be reversed, and the accused acquitted of the\u00a0 crime of which he is charged, with the costs of both instances <i>de oficio.<\/i><br\/><br\/>If he is in detention he will be discharged forthwith, and if he is at liberty\u00a0 on bail his bond will be canceled and his bondsmen exonerated.<br\/><br\/><i> Arellano, C. J., Mapa, Moreland<\/i>, and <i>Trent, JJ.<\/i>,\u00a0 concur.<br\/><\/div>",

In this\u00a0 document\u00a0 (Exhibit\u00a0 A), which was signed by Agustina Consolaci6n and Norberta Consolacion, assisted by her husband Ramon Hontiveros, the two sisters Agustina and\u00a0 Norberta\u00a0 acknowledged\u00a0 themselves\u00a0 indebted to\u00a0 the plaintiff,\u00a0 Manuel Riobo, in the sum of P9,190, and agreed to pay this amount in two\u00a0 equal installments, the\u00a0 first\u00a0 on July\u00a0 1, 1898, and the second on July 1, 1899.\u00a0\u00a0 To guarantee the payment of these\u00a0 amounts\u00a0 at the\u00a0 times specified,\u00a0 the sisters mortgaged several\u00a0 parcels\u00a0 of land.\u00a0 A complete description of the lands\u00a0 thus mortgaged is set forth\u00a0 in Exhibit A and in the complaint.<p>The plaintiff asked judgment for the sum of P14,519.58, being the amount of the original debt together with interest up to the time of the filing of the complaint, and for interest at the rate of 6 per cent\u00a0 from the\u00a0 commencement of this action until said payment\u00a0 be fully made.\u00a0 The plaintiff further prayed the court to order the sale at public auction of the mortgaged property to satisfy this debt, with interest and costs, in case the defendants\u00a0 failed to\u00a0 pay the same within the time fixed by law.<\/p><p>The defendants, after denying all the allegations in the complaint, alleged as a\u00a0 special defense\u00a0 that\u00a0 the public document\u00a0 (Exhibit A, upon which the plaintiff relies) is null and void for lack of\u00a0 consideration; that the plaintiff secured their signatures\u00a0 to this document\u00a0 by\u00a0 means of force and intimidation; and that notwithstanding the fact that they,\u00a0 the sisters, never at any time received one cent from the plaintiff, they paid the first installment of P4,595. The defendant Ramon Hontiveros\u00a0 further alleged that he and the plaintiff,\u00a0 before the execution of Exhibit A, had been\u00a0 engaged\u00a0 as\u00a0 partners in the purchase and sale of palay and other products of the country, and that plaintiff by reason of these transactions was justly indebted to him in the sum of Pl,324.50.\u00a0 The defendants by way of counter-claim asked\u00a0 judgment\u00a0 against\u00a0 the plaintiff\u00a0 for\u00a0 the\u00a0 sum of P5,919.50 (this sum being the P4,995,\u00a0 amount claimed to have been paid by the sisters, and the P1,324.50 which Hontiveros alleges is\u00a0 due him from the plaintiff), together with the interest and\u00a0 the costs of the cause.<\/p><p>The trial court,\u00a0 Hon. Jose C. Abreu presiding, after due trial, found;\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"1. That the defendants Agustina and Norberta Consolacion recognized by means of the public document (Exhibit A)\u00a0 a debt of P9,190 in favor of the plaintiff.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"2.

That as there was no agreement in Exhibit A\u00a0 that the defendants were\u00a0 to pay\u00a0 interest and that as plaintiff had not made a demand upon the defendants for the payment of the balance due, he, the plaintiff, was only entitled to interest from the\u00a0 date\u00a0 of the filing of this\u00a0 complaint.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"4. That the public document does not constitute a mortgage on the real property described therein for\u00a0 the reason that said document had not been inscribed in the property register.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"5. That the defendants were not entitled to recover on their counterclaims.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>As a consequence, judgment was entered in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of P5,195, with interest from the commencement of this action and the costs of the cause.<\/p><p>From this judgment both parties appealed and have presented separate bills of exceptions.<br\/>Counsel for the plaintiff now insist that the court erred:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"1.

In\u00a0 failing\u00a0 to find that the public\u00a0 document\u00a0 signed by the defendants was a duly recorded mortgage.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The only question raised\u00a0 in this court by\u00a0 counsel\u00a0 for defendants relates to the\u00a0 validity\u00a0 of the judgment against the defendant Agustina Consolacion.\u00a0\u00a0 It\u00a0 is contended that the public document\u00a0 (Exhibit A) is\u00a0 null and\u00a0 void\u00a0 as to this\u00a0 defendant for\u00a0 the reason that when she\u00a0 signed said document\u00a0 she\u00a0 was neither assisted by her husband nor had his consent.\u00a0 All other questions raised by the defendants in the court below and\u00a0 which were decided\u00a0 against them have been, in effect, abandoned on appeal.<\/p><p>The plaintiff alleged and so testified that the\u00a0 defendants had\u00a0 not only failed and refused\u00a0 to pay any part of\u00a0 the principal obligation but had also\u00a0 failed to pay all of\u00a0 the interest on the same except\u00a0 the sum\u00a0 of\u00a0 P600.\u00a0\u00a0 The trial court found that the defendants had\u00a0 in\u00a0 fact paid to\u00a0 the plaintiff the sum of\u00a0 P3,995.\u00a0\u00a0 We can not say that this finding\u00a0 of fact is against the weight of the testimony, but on the contrary it is supported by the testimony of Anatalio Hontiveros,\u00a0 brother\u00a0 of the defendant Ramon Honti- veros, who testified that by order of his brother Ramon he went to Iloilo from Capiz in 1898 and turned over\u00a0 to the plaintiff P3,995,\u00a0 and\u00a0 received\u00a0 a\u00a0 receipt therefor.\u00a0 This witness further testified that he gave\u00a0 this receipt to\u00a0 his brother in the presence of one Jorge Pardo.\u00a0\u00a0 Jorge Pardo corroborated the testimony\u00a0 of Anatalio\u00a0 Hontiveros with reference to the turning over of the receipt to the defendant Ramon.\u00a0\u00a0 Roque Hontiveros,\u00a0 a cousin of\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant Ramon, testified that Ramon borrowed from him\u00a0 P1,000 to be applied on the debt due the\u00a0 plaintiff; that he turned over this Pl,000 to Anatalio Hontiveros; that he\u00a0 accompanied the\u00a0 latter\u00a0 to the house of the plaintiff\u00a0 and witnessed the payment to the plaintiff of P3,995;\u00a0 and that the plaintiff made and signed a receipt for this amount and turned the same over to Anatalio Hontiveros.\u00a0 The defend- ant Ramon Hontiveros testified that this amount\u00a0 was paid to the plaintiff and that the plaintiff receipted for\u00a0 the same. The receipt mentioned by\u00a0 these\u00a0 witnesses was\u00a0 not presented during the\u00a0 trial\u00a0 for the reason,\u00a0 as\u00a0 explained\u00a0 by the defendant\u00a0 Ramon Hontiveros, that\u00a0 it had\u00a0 been destroyed during an attack on\u00a0 his troops\u00a0 by the American forces.\u00a0 In 1901, shortly after that attack, this defendant went before the local authorities in\u00a0 Capiz and stated that he had lost a number of valuable papers in said\u00a0 attack. This manifestation appears in a document executed by the said authorities of that date.<br\/><br\/>It is urged that the plaintiff is entitled to recover interest at the rate of 6 per cent on the P9,190 from the dates that the two payments of said amount became due.\u00a0\u00a0 The trial court found against the plaintiff on\u00a0 this\u00a0 point.\u00a0 We think the court did not err in so finding.\u00a0 There\u00a0 was nothing said about interest in the contract (Exhibit A), and before the plaintiff could recover any interest on said amount before the filing of this complaint, it was incumbent upon him to show\u00a0 that he had made\u00a0 a demand either judicially\u00a0 or extra judicially\u00a0 upon\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendants\u00a0 for\u00a0 the payment\u00a0 of this sum.\u00a0\u00a0 (Bowler <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs.<\/span> Alcazar, 13 Phil.

Rep.,\u00a0 79.)\u00a0\u00a0 The only thing in the record which tends to show that the plaintiff had made a demand upon the defendants for the payment of this amount is his answer to one question wherein he stated that\u00a0 he had\u00a0 written\u00a0 Ramon\u00a0 Hontiveros on various occasions\u00a0 to pay all or part of\u00a0 the debt, but he does not show when such letters were written.\u00a0 The dates on which these letters were written are not stated.\u00a0\u00a0 Such proof does not show a sufficient compliance with the law as to entitle the plaintiff to a judgment for accrued interest for any period of time prior to the institution of this action.<\/p><p>After judgment\u00a0 had\u00a0 been entered in this\u00a0 case\u00a0 in the \u00a0 court below, the plaintiff through his attorney presented a \u00a0 motion\u00a0 asking\u00a0 the\u00a0 court\u00a0 to grant a new trial upon the \u00a0 ground that new and material evidence had been discovered. \u00a0 This motion was accompanied by an affidavit in which the \u00a0 deponent stated that the document accompanying the motion for a new trial was the first copy of the original mortgage executed by the defendants in this case and\u00a0 that said \u00a0 document shows upon its face that the same had\u00a0 been \u00a0 inscribed\u00a0 in the property register.\u00a0 The trial court held \u00a0 that\u00a0 this\u00a0 affidavit\u00a0 was not\u00a0 sufficient to\u00a0 show\u00a0 that\u00a0 the \u00a0 plaintiff could not have discovered and presented the said \u00a0 document during the\u00a0 trial and the motion\u00a0 was therefore \u00a0 denied.\u00a0 The plaintiff in this instance does not assign as \u00a0 an error this ruling of the court, neither are we asked to \u00a0 grant a new trial upon this ground, but counsel ask this \u00a0 court to examine said document for the\u00a0 purpose\u00a0 of determining, whether or\u00a0 not the same had been duly inscribed. \u00a0 This document is not\u00a0 a part of the record and\u00a0 we are not \u00a0 at liberty to take it into consideration for the determination \u00a0 of this question.\u00a0 This document had never been presented \u00a0 and admitted in the court below, and the defendants have \u00a0 never had an opportunity to examine the same and question \u00a0 its validity.\u00a0 We cannot\u00a0 examine documents\u00a0 unless\u00a0 they \u00a0 have been properly presented.\u00a0\u00a0 We must confine\u00a0 ourselves<br\/>to the record as made in the court below.<\/p><p> The only testimony presented in reference to the question \u00a0 whether or not Exhibit A was duly inscribed,\u00a0 during the \u00a0 trial in the first instance, is the following question which \u00a0 was asked the plaintiff and his answer:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"Q. Was the mortgage\u00a0 executed by Ramon Hontiveros, Norberta and\u00a0 Agustina\u00a0 Consolacion, in\u00a0 your favor, inscribed in the property register? - A. The mortgage in my\u00a0 favor was inscribed in the property register.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>\u00a0 This\u00a0 testimony stands\u00a0 uncontradicted.\u00a0\u00a0 It\u00a0 is a positive \u00a0 statement that\u00a0 the mortgage\u00a0 was duly\u00a0 registered.\u00a0 The \u00a0 trial court failed to give this testimony due consideration. \u00a0 It is true that the certified copy\u00a0 (Exhibit A) does not show \u00a0 on\u00a0 its face\u00a0 that the original had been\u00a0 registered.\u00a0\u00a0 This \u00a0 copy\u00a0 (Exhibit A) was taken from the original document, \u00a0 and the original document would not necessarily show that \u00a0 it had been\u00a0 inscribed,\u00a0 but the first copy would necessarily \u00a0 show this fact, as the original was not the document taken \u00a0 to the register of deeds, the first copy issued by the\u00a0 notary \u00a0 public being the one presented for registration.\u00a0 We think\u00a0 the plaintiff's third assignment of error\u00a0 is well founded; \u00a0 that the mortgage was duly registered; and that the\u00a0 land \u00a0 described therein must be sold to satisfy\u00a0 this judgment in \u00a0 the plaintiff's favor if the defendants do not pay the same \u00a0 within the time specified by law.<\/p><p>Counsel for the defendants say that the court erred in \u00a0 rendering judgment against the defendant Agustina\u00a0 Consolacion for the payment of one-half of the unpaid balance \u00a0 of the original\u00a0 debt.\u00a0\u00a0 This contention\u00a0 is based\u00a0 upon the \u00a0 proposition\u00a0 that this defendant's husband did not consent \u00a0 or assist her in the execution of Exhibit\u00a0 A and that this \u00a0 being true,\u00a0 said\u00a0 exhibit is absolutely null and void as to \u00a0 this defendant, as she could not have entered into a contract \u00a0 without the assistance or consent of her husband.\u00a0 As to \u00a0 whether or\u00a0 not a married woman can enter into any\u00a0 contracts without her husband's assistance or consent, we find \u00a0 it unnecessary to decide.\u00a0 It is sufficient to\u00a0 say that in \u00a0 this case the defendant Agustina is not the proper\u00a0 person \u00a0 to raise this question.\u00a0\u00a0 She received\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiff's\u00a0 money \u00a0 and executed the document mortgaging part\u00a0 of\u00a0 her lands \u00a0 to guarantee the payment and she can not now claim\u00a0 that \u00a0 said document\u00a0 is without effect as to herself. Article 55 \u00a0 of the Law\u00a0 of Civil Marriage\u00a0 of June 18, 1870, provides \u00a0 that \"Only the husband and his heirs may enforce the nullity \u00a0 of the acts executed by his wife without proper permission \u00a0 or\u00a0 authorization.\"\u00a0 According\u00a0 to the\u00a0 plain provisions\u00a0 of this article,\u00a0 the wife cannot raise this question.<\/p><p>So much of the judgment appealed from which holds that the\u00a0 document\u00a0 executed\u00a0 by the defendants was\u00a0 not\u00a0 duly inscribed in the property registry and has all of the effects of a duly constituted mortgage\u00a0 is reversed, and\u00a0 in all\u00a0 other respects the same is hereby affirmed, without costs.<\/p><p><em>Arellano, C.

That one Antonio Munoz Ting Jian Co was born in China about seventy-five years ago; that he came\u00a0 to\u00a0 the Philippines about sixty years ago, and during his minority; that he has lived in the Philippine Islands continuously for the past forty-seven years, and that if\u00a0 he has been\u00a0 absent at all during any part of the whole period of\u00a0 his residence in said Islands, it has only\u00a0 been for temporary purposes and always with the\u00a0 intention,\u00a0 duly carried out in each instance, of returning shortly to his home in the Philippine Islands; that when the said\u00a0 Antonio Munoz first came to the Philippine\u00a0 Islands, he\u00a0 obtained from the Spanish Government the required license\u00a0 or permission\u00a0 to reside\u00a0 in the said Islands;<\/p><p>\"2. That about fifty years ago the said Antonio Munoz Ting Jian Co\u00a0 was converted\u00a0 to the Roman Catholic faith. and about the\u00a0 same time he\u00a0 lawfully married a\u00a0 native woman by whom he\u00a0 has had\u00a0 issue;<\/p><p>\"3. That he\u00a0 established his\u00a0 domicile in Camalig,\u00a0 Province of Albay with the intention of residing there; that he has in the course of his residence acquired real and other property; lived in a house\u00a0 of his own, and has been a self-supporting merchant,\u00a0 owning\u00a0 a retail store and having various other investments;<\/p><p>\"4. That Antonio\u00a0 Munoz Ting Jian Co never registered in any public registry,\u00a0 except it be in this, that in the year 1903 or\u00a0 1904, he did register\u00a0 under Act No. 702, of the Philippine\u00a0 Commission and now holds\u00a0 certificate of residence 348\/29537, issued in\u00a0 Albay; that in public\u00a0 documents of various\u00a0 kinds he\u00a0 has\u00a0 uniformly described himself as a resident of the Philippine Islands;<\/p><p>\"5. That after the death of the first wife of the said Antonio Munoz\u00a0 Ting Jian\u00a0 Co he was once more lawfully married, his second\u00a0 wife being one Antonia Nacional, a native\u00a0 of the Philippine Islands; that as a result of this second marriage there was born to the said Antonio Munoz Ting Jian Co, on the 11th day\u00a0 of January, 1880, in the town of Camalig, Province of Albay, one\u00a0 Benito Munoz, the petitioner herein;<\/p><p>\"6. That said Benito Munoz lived\u00a0 in the\u00a0 Philippine Islands with his father until he attained the\u00a0 age\u00a0 of eleven years, when\u00a0 he departed for China, and there\u00a0 remained until January 16, 1911, when he returned\u00a0 to the Philippine Islands in the\u00a0 steamer\u00a0 Taisang,\u00a0 and sought admission thereto as a native and citizen thereof;<\/p><p>\"7. That before\u00a0 the\u00a0 immigration\u00a0 officers who investigated his right of entry he presented satisfactory proof that he would\u00a0 have returned sooner to the Philippine Islands had\u00a0 it not been for certain financial difficulties, and that he had never intended to expatriate himself and had never taken any active steps to that end;<\/p><p>\"8. That the immigration officers denied the petitioner the right to\u00a0 enter the Philippine Islands solely on the theory that he is an\u00a0 alien of Chinese race\u00a0 who\u00a0 presents none of the required\u00a0 statutory proof\u00a0 that he is a member of the exempt class of Chinese persons;<\/p><p>\"9.

That if, under the facts above set forth, Benito Munoz is, as\u00a0 a matter of\u00a0 law, a citizen of the Philippine Islands, and if a\u00a0 decision\u00a0 of the board of special\u00a0 inquiry, based on such facts, and\u00a0 correctly\u00a0 determining the issue of fact, may be reviewed by this court, on the theory\u00a0 that there has been an erroneous application of law to the facts by the board, then, upon a determination\u00a0 by this court that there has been such erroneous finding as\u00a0 to\u00a0 the law in the present case, the\u00a0 decision of the court should be rendered in favor of the petitioner; otherwise not.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>This court has already held in the case of United States <em>vs.<\/em> Go Siaco (12 Phil.

Bounded on the north by Felipe de Guzman, on the east by Caile Santa Maria, on the south by Manuel de Santos,\u00a0 and on the west by Isabel Tambueco.<\/p><p>The court below found that this disputed tract was not included within the lands of Guzman, and was of the opinion that his southern line had been advanced over on to Santos and now embraces a part of his\u00a0 (Santos')\u00a0 land.<\/p><p>In\u00a0 the old deeds which describe the land of Guzman, the courses of the boundary lines are not given, but only the distances, with the bounding limits stated in general terms; while in the plot of the land filed with the petition (Exhibit A), both the courses and distances are shown.\u00a0\u00a0 The distances as given in the\u00a0 plot filed with the petition do not coincide in all respects with the distances given\u00a0 in the old deeds, but we do not consider this in itself a fatal defect for the reason that in many instances the distances\u00a0 in the old deeds were doubtless intended as approximations\u00a0 and the boundary\u00a0 lines were not\u00a0 always given\u00a0 with\u00a0 the\u00a0 same scientific accuracy as those at the present time.<\/p><p>The lower court stated that the several descriptions given in the deeds and records offered by Guzman in support of his title were all at variance with each other and that it was not possible to arrive at any definite conclusion with reference to the true description of the land of\u00a0 Felipe\u00a0 de Guzman.\u00a0 It is true that in some particulars the old deeds are not in harmony with later descriptions,\u00a0 but we think a careful examination of these descriptions shows that they evidently relate to one and the same plot of ground, and that in most essential respects they are in accord with the description of the land as shown in the registered title and in the petition.<\/p><p>The petitioner (the word petitioner used herein will refer to the original\u00a0 petitioner, Felipe de Guzman)\u00a0 files\u00a0 as his Exhibit D a certified transcript taken from the registrar's book, in which the history of the property claimed by the petitioner is given in so far as the same appears of record, and from this Exhibit D there appear\u00a0 various references and descriptions relating to this property.\u00a0 In one of the oldest references - a deed executed in 1876 - the measurements are given as follows:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"38 varas (31.75 meters) on the east side, on which it\u00a0 is bounded by a closed canal; on the\u00a0 south\u00a0 30 varas\u00a0 (25.7 meters)\u00a0 bounded by the\u00a0 convent lands; on the west side 28\/j varas\u00a0 (23.97 meters) and bounded by the lands of the convent; on the north side 42 varas\u00a0 (35.1 meters) and bounded by a closed canal, Buhat-Buhat.\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 Belonging also to the\u00a0 land a callejon used for entrance.\u00a0\u00a0 (The figures in meters are inserted,)\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>For the purposes of this decision this\u00a0 will be referred to as description No. 1.<\/p><p>In another part of Exhibit D we find this statement with reference to the callejon above mentioned: \"The callejon (used\u00a0 for entrance) to said land has disappeared through having been converted together with the closed canal Buhat-Buhat into a public street.\"\u00a0 It will be observed that Calls Santa\u00a0 Maria lying on the east side of said land is the only public street adjacent thereto,\u00a0 and consequently this must be the street to\u00a0 which reference is made in these descriptions.\u00a0 This last reference also places the callejon and the closed canal on the east side of the land - the same side as the public street.\u00a0 From\u00a0 these descriptions it will be seen that the land has the form of an irregular quadrilateral. The petitioner files a deed of sale, Exhibit B, executed June 8, 1909, by Don Rafael Reyes, as managing agent of the\u00a0 corporation\u00a0 \"Varadero de Manila,\" to himself\u00a0 (the petitioner)\u00a0 and also a\u00a0 deed of sale, Exhibit C,\u00a0 executed October\u00a0 19, 1906, by the sheriff of Manila,\u00a0 Mr. James J. Peterson, to the said Don Rafael Reyes.\u00a0 In both of these deeds we find\u00a0 the land described as follows:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"A vacant plot of ground in the barrio of Bancaso of the District of Tondo of this city,\u00a0 whose number, if\u00a0 it has any, is not given,\u00a0 bounded on the\u00a0 front side (east)\u00a0 by an\u00a0 unnamed public\u00a0 street;\u00a0 on the right side as one enters\u00a0 (north side), formerly with a closed\u00a0 canal, now changed into unnumbered lots belonging to the heirs of Dona Sotera Trinidad\u00a0 and\u00a0 Don\u00a0 Ramon Lopez; on the left side (south side) by an unnumbered\u00a0 lot which was formerly the property of the\u00a0 parochial\u00a0 convent of Tondo and now that of\u00a0 Isabel Sinquingco\u00a0 (Sumpingco) ; and on\u00a0 the rear (west\u00a0 side) by an inside lot which formerly belonged to the said convent and\u00a0 is now owned by\u00a0 Don Manuel\u00a0 Santos.\u00a0 It\u00a0 (the lot herein described)\u00a0 measures 42 varas\u00a0 (equivalent\u00a0 to 35 meters and 10 centimeters) on the front side (east side, now Calle Santa Maria)\u00a0 ; 38 varas,\u00a0 (equivalent to 31 meters and 76 centimeters) on the right side (the north side);\u00a0 28 varas and 2 feet (equivalent to 23 meters and 97 centimeters) on the left side (the south\u00a0 side) ; and 30 varas (equivalent to 25 meters and 7 centimeters)\u00a0 on\u00a0 the rear side (the west side), forming a total area of 838.6 square meters.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>For the'purpose\u00a0 of this decision\u00a0 this will be referred to as description\u00a0 No. 2.<\/p><p>The true description of the property of Felipe de Guzman with reference to the adjacent property owners and boundary lines at the present time is that given in the\u00a0 petition. There is\u00a0 some contention\u00a0 as to courses and distances, but none as to the\u00a0 general location and situation of the property. This fact, then, establishes that Calle Santa Maria is\u00a0 on the east, that the\u00a0 land\u00a0 of Matfuel\u00a0 Santos\u00a0 is on the south, that the property of Isabel Tambueco (an heir of Isabel Sumpingco) lies on the west, and that the property of Francisco Toribio and Lucio\u00a0 Buzon\u00a0 (successors to Sotera Trinidad and\u00a0 Ramon Lopez)\u00a0 lies on the north side.\u00a0\u00a0 Descriptions Nos. 1 and 2 above referred to do not agree, nor do they correspond in all their measurements with the true description\u00a0 of the property in question.<\/p><p>For the purpose\u00a0 of showing clearly that these apparent differences are not real but are in fact mere errors\u00a0 and misstatements, we have examined the plots of the land as shown by descriptions Nos. 1 and 2.\u00a0\u00a0 These plots, however, are only approximations and the courses are\u00a0 only given in general terms, but\u00a0 they serve to show the length of the boundary lines and the position\u00a0 of the lot with reference to the\u00a0 adjacent property owners.\u00a0\u00a0 A comparison of these two\u00a0 plots makes\u00a0 it evident that they are intended to represent\u00a0 one. and the same\u00a0 parcel\u00a0 of\u00a0 ground.\u00a0\u00a0 The same measurements are indicated, although they are not assigned to the\u00a0 same sides in both plots.\u00a0 In\u00a0 description\u00a0 No. 1 we have a measurement of 35.1 meters on the north side\u00a0 and 31.76 meters on the east side, while in\u00a0 description No.\u00a0 2 the 31.76 meters\u00a0 is given for the north\u00a0 side and the 35.1 meters\u00a0 for\u00a0 the\u00a0 east side - a reversal of measurements. Likewise, in description No. 1, we have for the south side a measurement of 27.7 meters and for the west a measurement of 23.97\u00a0 meters,\u00a0 while in description\u00a0 No. 2 these measurements are reversed, 23.97 meters being given for the south side and 25.7 meters for the west side.\u00a0 The lands of Manuel Santos are today and have always been on the south and those of Isabel Tambueco (formerly Isabel Sumpingco) on the west. Yet, in description\u00a0 No. 2 we find that their respective positions are reversed and that\u00a0 the lands of Santos are placed on the west and those of Isabel Sumpingco on the south.\u00a0 These defective and erroneous statements with reference to the descriptions\u00a0 of the petitioner's land in\u00a0 the old deeds are urged by the oppositor as making it impossible to know what is the\u00a0 true description of the land claimed by\u00a0 the petitioner, and that such statements being so palpably wrong, these title deeds are not worthy of consideration and\u00a0 should\u00a0 not be given any weight as supporting petitioner's title.<\/p><p>In\u00a0 this we cannot\u00a0 agree.\u00a0 These errors\u00a0 of description which appear\u00a0 in the old records\u00a0 and which have\u00a0 been successively repeated in\u00a0 subsequent transfers ought not to militate against petitioner's title when it is shown that the land sought to be registered is\u00a0 exactly the same\u00a0 parcel as that included in the old deeds, and also when it is\u00a0 shown as in this case that the\u00a0 petitioner is\u00a0 now asserting title to only such property as is embraced\u00a0 in the registered\u00a0 deed under which he claims.<\/p><p>But it is\u00a0 insisted that the petitioner is asking for the registration of 154 square meters not embraced in his registered title.\u00a0 This registered title, according to the measurements given therein, calls for 838.6 square meters, while the petitioner is only asking for the registration of 727.66 square meters.\u00a0\u00a0 The record does not offer any specific explanation for this difference, but the existence of\u00a0 this fact relieves the\u00a0 petitioner of the charge that he is\u00a0 claiming more property than his registered deed\u00a0 covers.\u00a0 This difference in area is doubtless due to the fact that the older descriptions were made with no\u00a0 very great effort at exactness and the measurements and area given were the results of approximations rather than of accurate measurements and calculations.<\/p><p>The decision\u00a0 of the\u00a0 court\u00a0 below appears to\u00a0 have been largely based upon a sworn statement of\u00a0 Carlos\u00a0 Palanca, made for the purpose\u00a0 of taxation, in which\u00a0 the parcel of ground in question is described as follows:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"It is bounded on the front side by an\u00a0 unnamed\u00a0 callejon, on the rear by the land of Francisco Toribio,\u00a0 on the right side\u00a0 (entering)\u00a0 by the\u00a0 land of Manuel Santos, and on the left side by the land of Isabel Sumpingco.\u00a0 The land is in the form of a rectangle with a measurement of 23.5 meters on the front side by 29.5 meters in depth.\" <\/p><\/blockquote><p>This description is\u00a0 at\u00a0 variance with\u00a0 all the other descriptions of the land in question.\u00a0 In no other description does the land appear to have a rectangular shape and it is not now contended by either party that it has such a shape. This\u00a0 description is not correct; for it is evident from the record that the land is not rectangular\u00a0 in shape and that its measurements are different from those given\u00a0 in the statement of Palanca.\u00a0 The positions of the adjacent land owners are\u00a0 not their true positions as shown\u00a0 by the other records in the case,\u00a0 nor\u00a0 is it clear at all just what\u00a0 side is to\u00a0 be taken as the\u00a0 front side according to Palanca's description.\u00a0 In\u00a0 all the other\u00a0 records of\u00a0 the land the side bordering on\u00a0 what is now Calle Santa Maria is taken as the front side; but if we assume that as the front side in the Palanca description, we have\u00a0 a\u00a0 front\u00a0 measurement of 23.5 meters with a depth of 29.5 meters.\u00a0 This, then, would put the lands of Francisco Toribio in the rear, when, as a matter of fact, they\u00a0 lie on the north\u00a0 side.\u00a0 This would also place the land of Santos\u00a0 on the north instead of the south, and the lands of Isabel Sumpingco on\u00a0 the\u00a0 south instead of in the rear\u00a0 (west).<\/p><p>The court below, however, assumed the\u00a0 southern boundary of the Palanca description as the front\u00a0 side, thus establishing the unnamed callejon as running\u00a0 between the lands of\u00a0 Felipe de Guzman\u00a0 (successor to\u00a0 Palanca)\u00a0 and Manuel Santos.\u00a0\u00a0 With\u00a0 this assumption, then, we have\u00a0 a boundary line between Guzman and\u00a0 Santos of\u00a0 23.5 meters\u00a0 and\u00a0 a measurement of 29.5 meters for the side bordering on what is now Calle Santa Maria, this last measurement being less by\u00a0 some five meters than the measurements shown\u00a0 in the other records of the case.<\/p><p>But even\u00a0 this assumption will not make\u00a0 the Palanca description harmonize\u00a0 with the old\u00a0 records\u00a0 or\u00a0 what\u00a0 is the known position\u00a0 of the land in question.\u00a0 For, taking the southern side\u00a0 as the front, according to this\u00a0 description the lands of Manuel Santos would\u00a0 lie on\u00a0 the. right side (east) instead of lying on the south\u00a0 side.\u00a0 Whatever view is taken\u00a0 of\u00a0 this Palanca description, it is\u00a0 uncertain, confusing, and\u00a0 evidently erroneous; nor do\u00a0 we see any\u00a0 valid reason for assuming this to be a true description of the property.\u00a0 The lower court accepted the measurement of 29.5 meters\u00a0 for the eastern side as a true measurement and concluded\u00a0 that\u00a0 since the present measurement of the eastern side\u00a0 of said land was claimed to be 34.87 meters, that evidently\u00a0 the southern line\u00a0 had been\u00a0 advanced some five meters.\u00a0 This deduction is based upon the theory that the description made by Palanca was\u00a0 a true description of the land;\u00a0 but as we have said, this description is\u00a0 not accurate and reliable.\u00a0 It was made under\u00a0 circumstances when\u00a0 absolute\u00a0 certainty\u00a0 as to\u00a0 description\u00a0 was\u00a0 neither expected nor required.<\/p><p>Therefore,\u00a0 the petitioner's registered title covers all\u00a0 the land described\u00a0 in his petition.\u00a0 The oppositor presents in support of his\u00a0 contention\u00a0 oral evidence\u00a0 only.\u00a0\u00a0 This oral testimony is not sufficient to overcome the registered title.<\/p><p>The judgment appealed from is therefore reversed and judgment entered in favor\u00a0 of the petitioner, directing\u00a0 the inscription of\u00a0 the\u00a0 land\u00a0 in dispute in the\u00a0 name of\u00a0 the appellant without costs.\u00a0 So ordered.<\/p><p><em>Torres, Johnson, Carson<\/em>, and <em>Moreland, JJ.<\/em>,\u00a0 concur.<\/p><\/div>",

But we are unanimously of opinion that had this subscribing witness been proven to have been in the outer room at the time when the testator and the other subscribing witnesses\u00a0 attached their signatures\u00a0 to the instrument in the inner room,\u00a0 it would have been\u00a0 invalid as a will, the attaching of those signatures under such circumstances not being done \"in the presence\" of the witness in the outer room.\u00a0 This because the line of vision from this\u00a0 witness to the testator and the other subscribing witnesses would necessarily have been impeded\u00a0 by the curtain separating the inner room from the outer one \"at the moment of inscription of each signature.\"<br\/><br\/>In the case just cited,\u00a0 on which\u00a0 the\u00a0 trial court relied, we held that:<br\/><blockquote>\"The true test of presence of the testator and the witnesses in the execution of a Will is not whether they actually saw each other sign, but whether they might have seen each other sign, had they chosen to do so, considering their mental and physical\u00a0 condition and position\u00a0 with relation to each other at the moment of\u00a0 inscription of each signature.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>But\u00a0 it\u00a0 is especially\u00a0 to\u00a0 be noted that the\u00a0 position of the\u00a0 parties with relation to\u00a0 each other <i>at the moment of the subscription of each signature,<\/i> must be such that they may see each other sign if they\u00a0 choose to do so.\u00a0 This, of course, does not mean that\u00a0 the testator and the subscribing witnesses may be held to have executed the\u00a0 instrument in the presence of each\u00a0 other if it appears that\u00a0 they would not have been able to see each other sign at that moment, without changing their\u00a0 relative\u00a0 positions or existing conditions.\u00a0\u00a0 The evidence in the case relied upon by the trial judge discloses that \"at the\u00a0 moment when the witness Javellana signed the document\u00a0 he was actually and physically present and in such position with relation to\u00a0 Jaboneta that he could see everything\u00a0 that\u00a0 took place by merely casting his eyes in the\u00a0 proper direction\u00a0 and <i>without any physical obstruction to prevent his doing\u00a0 so.\"<\/i>\u00a0 And the decision merely\u00a0 laid down the doctrine that\u00a0 the question whether the testator and the subscribing witnesses to an alleged will sign the instrument in the presence of\u00a0 each other does not depend\u00a0 upon proof of the fact that their eyes\u00a0 were actually cast upon the paper\u00a0 at the\u00a0 moment\u00a0 of\u00a0 its subscription by each of them,\u00a0 but that at that moment\u00a0 existing conditions and their position with relation to each other were such that by merely casting the eyes in the proper direction they could have seen each other sign.\u00a0 To extend the doctrine further would\u00a0 open the\u00a0 door to\u00a0 the possibility of all manner of fraud, substitution, and the like, and would defeat .the purpose for which this\u00a0 particular\u00a0 condition is prescribed in the code as one of the\u00a0 requisites in the execution\u00a0 of a\u00a0 will.<br\/><br\/>The decree entered by\u00a0 the court below admitting the instrument propounded therein\u00a0 to probate as the last will and\u00a0 testament\u00a0 of Pedro Rimando, deceased,\u00a0 is affirmed with costs of this instance against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i> Arellano, C.

The prayer\u00a0 of the complaint is for the\u00a0 recovery of\u00a0 the amount which plaintiffs allege this defendant admitted himself to\u00a0 be indebted to them, as a\u00a0 result of an extrajudicial partition agreement touching these estates, or perhaps more accurately speaking of a settlement of\u00a0 account\u00a0 between the plaintiffs and this defendant.\u00a0 This action is not, therefore, of the nature of \"actions\u00a0 against executors, administrators and guardians, touching\u00a0 the\u00a0 performance of\u00a0 their official duties\" or of \"actions for account and settlement by them\" or of \"actions for the distribution of the estates of deceased persons among heirs and\u00a0 distributees\"\u00a0 or of \"actions for the\u00a0 payment of legacies\"\u00a0 which, under the\u00a0 provisions of section 377 of the Code of\u00a0 Civil Procedure must be brought in the province in which the will was admitted to\u00a0 probate, or letters of administration were granted or the guardian appointed.\u00a0 Appellant's first assignment of error, based on the lack of jurisdiction of the trial court, can not, therefore, be sustained.<br\/><br\/>We have so frequently construed the provisions of section 141\u00a0 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which\u00a0 declare that \"Rulings of the court upon minor matters, such as adjournments, postponements of trials, and other matters addressed to the discretion of the court in the performance of its duty, shall not be subject to exception,\" that\u00a0 it is not necessary to go into appellants' assignments of alleged error in certain rulings of this\u00a0 class made by the trial court at the hearing below.\u00a0\u00a0 Nothing which even suggests the abuse of the\u00a0 discretion thus confirmed to the trial court is shown\u00a0 to have taken\u00a0 place in\u00a0 this\u00a0 case, and\u00a0 in the\u00a0 absence of proof of a clear abuse of discretion, this court has\u00a0 no authority to correct alleged errors in its exercise.\u00a0\u00a0 (Veloso <i>vs<\/i>.

M. Arroyo, son of Ignacio, and a\u00a0 lawyer by profession, and with the full power of attorney\u00a0 from his father to transact his affairs,\u00a0 came from Iloilo to\u00a0 the hacienda of his father, which hacienda is known by the name of Sto. Rosario,\u00a0 in Binalbagan, Occidental Negros, for the purpose of arranging some settlements with debtors of his father,\u00a0 including the defendants\u00a0 in this case.<br\/><br\/>\"According to the testimony of\u00a0 the\u00a0 witnesses for the plaintiff, on May 23,\u00a0 1907, Matias Granada came from the municipality of Isabela, where he lived, to this hacienda\u00a0 to effect\u00a0 a settlement regarding the indebtedness heretofore referred to, and which at that time amounted, with interest, to P2,381.\u00a0 Defendants claim it was on\u00a0 the\u00a0 24th of May that he came.<br\/><br\/>\"According to the witnesses for the plaintiff, Matias Granada there\u00a0 stated\u00a0 to\u00a0 J. M.\u00a0 Arroyo that they were unable to pay this\u00a0 indebtedness in\u00a0 money, but desired to transfer in settlement of the\u00a0 debt a piece\u00a0 of land, which Matias Granada said was first quality\u00a0 land, good for the raising of sugar cane and rice, and was located near certain land in 'Cumansi,'\u00a0 which Ignacio Arroyo had secured from one Narciso Borja, and that these lands would be an\u00a0 addition and\u00a0 could be\u00a0 made a part of those secured from Narciso Borja.<br\/><br\/>\"According, further,\u00a0 to the witnesses for\u00a0 the plaintiff, J. M.\u00a0 Arroyo at first objected\u00a0 to accepting\u00a0 these\u00a0 lands, stating that his father desired\u00a0 the\u00a0 money, but finally on the representation of Matias Granada as to the\u00a0 quality and location of the land that he desired to transfer of thirty- four hectares, and considering that\u00a0 it was near by to the lands secured\u00a0 by Ignacio Arroyo from Narciso Borja\u00a0 and would be an addition\u00a0 thereto, and if the land\u00a0 was such as represented, it was well worth\u00a0 the price\u00a0 of the indebtedness, J. M. Arroyo agreed to accept the same.<br\/><br\/>\"The defendant\u00a0 denies that he represented\u00a0 at this time that\u00a0 the land was first quality land, or that it was near the lands mentioned\u00a0 in\u00a0 Cumansi,\u00a0 but the preponderance of evidence presented appears to support the contention of the plaintiff in this respect.<br\/><br\/>\"It appears both from the\u00a0 testimony of plaintiff and defendant Matias Granada that on this date, whether\u00a0 it was the 23d\u00a0 or 24th of May,\u00a0 Arroyo\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 house of this hacienda, Sto.\u00a0 Rosario, in\u00a0 Binalbagan, wrote out a cancellation of the indebtedness\u00a0 of P2,381, and signed it. Plaintiff claims that he then gave this cancellation to Matias Granada, together with a form of document of transfer of land with blank\u00a0 spaces for the description to be inserted therein, and that he gave these papers to Matias Granada, who was to return\u00a0 to Isabela and have his mother execute the deed transferring these thirty-four hectares to Ignacio Arroyo,\u00a0 and\u00a0 bring the\u00a0 deed back\u00a0 the\u00a0 next\u00a0 day,\u00a0 which according to plaintiff would be May 24th.<br\/><br\/>\"Plaintiff further claims that this deed was sent back on May 25th, brought by a younger brother of Matias Granada.<br\/><br\/>\"It is the claim of defendants that this transaction of the hacienda of Sto. Rosario was made on May 24th, about 10.30 in the morning; he and J. M. Arroyo started for Isabela, both going on horseback, and that on the way there they stopped\" in the\u00a0 jurisdiction\u00a0 of\u00a0 Hinigaran to\u00a0 view those thirty-four hectares of land; that it was pointed out by the defendant, Matias Granada, and examined by J. M. Arroyo, and that after having had dinner there on the land, they then proceeded to Isabela to the house of Matias Granada, where under the dictation of J. M. Arroyo, Matias Granada wrote out the document of transfer of the land, and the two of them, with the mother, Celedonia Gentero, went before a notary public\u00a0 and had the document executed, and at the same time J.\u00a0 M.\u00a0 Arroyo acknowledged before\u00a0 this notary public, Rosauro Barroquina,\u00a0 the cancellation of the debt that he had written out in the hacienda Sto. Rosario, but that instead of inserting\u00a0 the series and\u00a0 number and date of the cedula of J. M. Arroyo, it was left blank because he had left his cedula at the hacienda Sto.\u00a0 Rosario, and that this work was completed about 4 o'clock that evening, when J. M. Arroyo started on his return to the hacienda and sent his\u00a0 cedula\u00a0 back that evening, arriving in the hands of Matias Granada about 6 o'clock, and was the same evening by him given to the notary public and the series and number and date were inserted.<br\/><br\/>\"J. M. Arroyo denies that he ever visited the land in question on\u00a0 this day,\u00a0 or that\u00a0 he\u00a0 went to the house of Matias Granada in\u00a0 Isabela,\u00a0 or that he made the acknowledgment that appears in the\u00a0 cancellation of indebtedness before the notary public,\u00a0 and\u00a0 testifies positively that he has never ridden a horse on\u00a0 any occasion since the time of the revolution, when\u00a0 he\u00a0 was\u00a0 thrown and\u00a0 injured\u00a0 his\u00a0 arm, which injury continues yet.<br\/><br\/>\"The notary public as a witness for the defendants testifies to J. M. Arroyo\u00a0 appearing and\u00a0 making\u00a0 the acknowledgment, and two other witnesses for the defendant testify to his being in\u00a0 Isabela\u00a0 on that date,\u00a0 while, on the other hand, some witnesses for the plaintiff testify that Matias Granada returned from the hacienda Sto. Rosario alone and\u00a0 that J. M. Arroyo did not leave it.<br\/><br\/>It\u00a0 appears further according to the\u00a0 evidence\u00a0 of\u00a0 the plaintiff that in the month of June following this transaction, J. M.\u00a0 Arroyo sent\u00a0 parties to\u00a0 take\u00a0 over the\u00a0 delivery\u00a0 of this\u00a0 land and to report to him upon it, and that he then discovered that the land was not located where represented by Matias\u00a0 Granada,\u00a0 and neither\u00a0 was it of the quality\u00a0 as represented,\u00a0 nor was it land suited for the raising of sugar cane and palay, but\u00a0 was mostly covered with trees\u00a0 and at that time\u00a0 also covered with water from knee-deep\u00a0 to shoulder-deep in most places.\u00a0 Therefore plaintiff has asked that\u00a0 this deed be set aside\u00a0 and that defendants be declared to be indebted to him yet in the said sum of P2,381, with the interest.<br\/><br\/>\"According to the evidence presented,\u00a0 first-class lands located where this particular\u00a0 parcel is are valued at P100 to P120\u00a0 per\u00a0 cavan, second-class lands at from -P40 to P50 per cavan, and third-class\u00a0 lands at P20\u00a0 to P25\u00a0 per\u00a0 cavan, and fourth-class lands at P15 per cavan.<br\/><br\/>\"All of the witnesses for the plaintiff who have examined this particular parcel place this land as of third or of fourth class\u00a0 quality and Matias Granada himself admits that\u00a0 he believes it to be second or third class land.<br\/><br\/>\"There is some testimony on the part of the defendants stating that in Spanish times more than three thousand cavanes of palay were raised from this land, but it is very evident that means\u00a0 not only what was raised on this parcel, but also from all of the other parcels near by there belonging to Matias Granada, his mother, or the estate of their father, because at from forty to fifty cavanes\u00a0 of\u00a0 palay per\u00a0 cavan of land, as Matias Granada testifies this\u00a0 land would produce, it could not certainly produce any such\u00a0 total, even if it was all in <i>palay.<\/i>\"<\/blockquote>Upon these\u00a0 facts the court\u00a0 found\u00a0 that the documents in question were executed by\u00a0 means of false and fraudulent representations of the defendants in\u00a0 this case and ordered their annulment and cancellation.<br\/><br\/>We are unable to\u00a0 agree with the conclusions of the learned trial court\u00a0 upon these\u00a0 facts.\u00a0 In our judgment there\u00a0 is not sufficient evidence to sustain\u00a0 the allegation of\u00a0 fraud.\u00a0 To set\u00a0 aside an instrument, solemnly executed and voluntarily delivered, upon the ground that its execution was obtained by\u00a0 false and\u00a0 fraudulent representations,\u00a0 the\u00a0 proof must be clear and convincing.\u00a0\u00a0 We do not think that the evidence adduced shows by a fair preponderance that there were suph false and fraudulent representations.<br\/><br\/>In a sense this opinion on the merits is useless, for the reason that the person bringing the action has\u00a0 no interest whatever in the\u00a0 subject matter\u00a0 thereof and\u00a0 can have no interest whatever in any judgment rendered therein.\u00a0 The action is brought in the name of Jose M. Arroyo as apoderado of Ignacio Arroyo.\u00a0 There is no provision of law permitting an action to be brought in that manner.\u00a0 Jose M. Arroyo, as apoderado,\u00a0 has absolutely no interest in this litigation.\u00a0 He has absolutely no right to bring the defendant into court or put him to the expense of a litigation.\u00a0 The real and only party in interest is Ignacio Arroyo.\u00a0 Under articles 114 and 122 of the Code of Civil\u00a0 Procedure he\u00a0 should be plaintiff.. He is not a party to this action and has in no way appeared or taken part herein.\u00a0 A\u00a0 judgment for\u00a0 or against\u00a0 Jose M. Arroyo personally\u00a0 or as apoderado in no way binds or affects\u00a0 Ignacio.\u00a0 As a necessary result a decision in\u00a0 this case\u00a0 is\u00a0 utterly\u00a0 futile.\u00a0 It\u00a0 does\u00a0 nothing.\u00a0 It touches no interest, settles no question, binds no party, quiets no litigation.\u00a0\u00a0 Courts ought not to be required to\u00a0 spend their time solemnly considering and\u00a0 deciding cases where nobody can be bound\u00a0 and no interests affected as a\u00a0 result\u00a0 of\u00a0 such deliberation and\u00a0 decision.<br\/><br\/>While, as we have said, our opinion upon the merits as presented by the facts of this case is, in a sense, useless, in another sense it\u00a0 is not quite so.\u00a0\u00a0 By such opinion\u00a0 Ignacio Arroyo will know that, although the present judgment does not, upon the record before us, bind him, the result\u00a0 of an action brought by him,\u00a0 subsequent to this opinion, will be adverse to him upon the\u00a0 same facts.\u00a0\u00a0 From this point of view this opinion upon the merits, as presented in this action, may\u00a0 have the effect\u00a0 of forestalling further\u00a0 litigation of this question,\u00a0 an\u00a0 end worth the trouble taken to effect it.<br\/><br\/>For these reasons the\u00a0 complaint is dismissed,\u00a0 without special finding as to costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Ruiz,\u00a0 the successor of Antero Inosanto to the office of municipal secretary, a witness\u00a0 for the\u00a0 prosecution,\u00a0 testified that he could not positively identify the writing\u00a0 of\u00a0 the entry\u00a0 in\u00a0 the register of births,\u00a0 aforementioned,\u00a0 as being that of Antero Inosanto, and, on cross- examination by the defense, stated that\u00a0 he knew the writing of the accused and did not believe that the entry in\u00a0 question was made\u00a0 by Inosanto, while he did\u00a0 identify\u00a0 the handwriting of other entries in that register as\u00a0 being that of the latter.<br\/><\/li>\u00a0 <li>According to this same witness, there is furthermore a\u00a0 certificate of birth, and there was issued a corresponding birth certificate for Maxima Zausa, which\u00a0 was presented as evidence in this case.\u00a0 This birth certificate is a copy of the entry, and the witness positively asserts that\u00a0 the handwriting is that\u00a0 of Vicente Coronel, an assistant to the former municipal secretary, Antero Inosanto.<br\/>\u00a0 <\/li><li>Antero Inosanto also\u00a0 issued a certificate\u00a0 which, according to the same witness, is made out and delivered\u00a0 when requested, and was presented in evidence\u00a0 as Exhibit C. There is no doubt that this certificate was issued by Antero Inosanto.\u00a0 It, also, is an exact reproduction of the falsified entry found in the register of births.<br\/><\/li>\u00a0 <li>The Court of First Instance\u00a0 of\u00a0 Capiz, which\u00a0 tried the case, found from the evidence that it was not Inosanto, but his\u00a0 clerk,\u00a0 Vicente Coronel,\u00a0 who\u00a0 recorded\u00a0 the\u00a0 birth, and that, at the time Pedro Zausa presented himself, Inosanto was in the council chamber, where the council was holding a session.<br\/><\/li>\u00a0 <li>Although the trial court did not consider the defendant guilty of the falsification committed in tfre register itself, it\u00a0 held him liable for the falsity contained in\u00a0 the certificate, Exhibit C,\u00a0 issued in accordance with that entry,\u00a0 for the reason that he\u00a0 knowingly\u00a0 recorded\u00a0 a falsehood,\u00a0 for he knew that the child Maxima Zausa could not be\u00a0 the legitimate daughter\u00a0 of\u00a0 Pedro and\u00a0 Caridad, knowing that Caridad was Pedro's daughter,\u00a0 and, instead of correcting and rectifying the entry in the\u00a0 register book, ratified and sanctioned the falsification\u00a0 therein committed, by his issuance of this certificate.<\/li><\/ol><p>By\u00a0 virtue of these findings the court held\u00a0 that the\u00a0 defendant was\u00a0 guilty of the crime penalized by article 310 of the Penal\u00a0 Code and\u00a0 accordingly sentenced him to suspension from public office for a period of three years, four months and one\u00a0 day, to pay a fine of 325 pesetas and, in case of insolvency, to the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment, and to the payment of the costs. The Attorney-General, in this\u00a0 instance, is of the opinion that, leaving aside the question\u00a0 as to whether the defendant could issue the certificate Exhibit C and record therein facts contrary to or\u00a0 different from those contained in the register book without incurring the crime of falsification with\u00a0 which he is charged, Antero\u00a0 Inosanto certainly can not be sentenced under the said article 310 of the Penal Code, inasmuch as the Exhibit C is not a\u00a0 certificate of\u00a0 merit or service, of good conduct, of poverty or of other similar circumstances, that is to say, of purely personal things or accidentals, according to\u00a0 the\u00a0 interpretation given\u00a0 to the words of\u00a0 this last\u00a0 phrase by the supreme court of Spain in its decision of February 17, 1877;\u00a0 but\u00a0 that it is a certificate of an inscription in a register under his charge, with the data of\u00a0 which it\u00a0 substantially agrees.\u00a0 Therefore he concluded\u00a0 that, with a reversal of the judgment appealed from, the defendant should\u00a0 be acquitted, and the costs assessed <em>de\u00a0 oficio.<\/em><\/p><p>In\u00a0 entire agreement\u00a0 with the preceding opinion, the judgment appealed from\u00a0 is reversed\u00a0 and the defendant acquitted, with the costs\u00a0 <em>de oficio.<\/em><\/p><p><em> Torres,\u00a0 Mapa,\u00a0 Johnson, Carson,\u00a0 Moreland,<\/em>\u00a0 and <em>Trent, JJ<\/em>., concur.<\/p><\/div>",

Lobingier presiding, convicting each of the appellants of a violation of section 31 of Act No.\u00a0 1761\u00a0 and sentencing each of them\u00a0 to six months' imprisonment and to pay the costs of the action.<p>It appears that a few days prior to the 5th day of November, 1910, the appellant Gabriela Esguerra, who lived in San\u00a0 Miguel de Mayumo, being\u00a0 a friend of the family of the\u00a0 other appellant,\u00a0 Valeriano\u00a0 de los Reyes, came to visit him and his wife at their\u00a0 home in the city of Manila; that on the said 5th day of November, and while Gabriela was still there, certain revenue officials went to the house of the accused Valeriano to\u00a0 search for opium; that having arrived there\u00a0 they were refused admission\u00a0 to\u00a0 the\u00a0 house by Valeriano upon the ground that they were not authorized to search\u00a0 his premises, they\u00a0 having no search warrant authorizing them to do so; that, after a few moments' conversation, and upon their assertion that they were officers of the\u00a0 law, while not consenting,\u00a0 he offered no physical resistance to their entry, and the search for the drug began; that while some of the officers were in the house prosecuting the\u00a0 search therein, others were on the outside watching to see that no one left the house; that during the progress of the\u00a0 search in the front\u00a0 part of the house one of the officers\u00a0 outside saw the\u00a0 accused Gabriela throw a package from the window\u00a0 of the\u00a0 kitchen into the grass behind the house; that upon\u00a0 recovering the package\u00a0 it was found to contain\u00a0 a considerable quantity of morphine.<\/p><p>It is\u00a0 conceded in this case\u00a0 that at the time the drug was\u00a0 discovered the defendant Valeriano was in the front part of the house, while the\u00a0 accused Gabriela was\u00a0 in a room in the rear used as a kitchen; that there is no direct evidence of any kind showing\u00a0 that the accused Valeriano had any knowledge whatever of the fact that the\u00a0 accused Gabriela had possession\u00a0 of\u00a0 the drug.\u00a0 It is\u00a0 substantially admitted by the court in its opinion\u00a0 convicting Valeriano that the only evidence relative to\u00a0 his knowledge that the opium was in his house is derived from\u00a0 the fact that he refused permission to\u00a0 the officials to search his premises, the inference being drawn from such refusal that\u00a0 the accused had knowledge of the fact that the\u00a0 contraband drug was located in his house, otherwise he would have\u00a0 offered no objection to the search.\u00a0\u00a0 The trial court says:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"Counsel for the defense does not deny that\u00a0 if the Government's evidence is accepted as true the opium in question was in the woman's\u00a0 possession,\u00a0 but he\u00a0 denies that it was in the man's also.\u00a0 But under\u00a0 the\u00a0 law the said\u00a0 accused is guilty if the\u00a0 evidence discloses\u00a0 his\u00a0 'knowingly\u00a0 having on his premises any opium'\u00a0 (Act No. 1761, sec. 31).\u00a0 The man admitted (p. 18)\u00a0 on the stand that the\u00a0 house was his; and that he knew that the opium was there\u00a0 seems clear from\u00a0 the fact the he endeavored to prevent the search of the premises.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>This is\u00a0 all that the trial court has to\u00a0 say with reference to the evidence\u00a0 which supports the\u00a0 conviction of\u00a0 the accused Valeriano.\u00a0 We do not believe\u00a0 that this is sufficient. The accused Gabriela\u00a0 was only a visitor in the house of Valeriano.\u00a0 She had been there but a short time.\u00a0\u00a0 At the time of the search the morphine was found exclusively in her possession and under her control.\u00a0 It\u00a0 nowhere appears that any member of the family of Valeriano had the slightest knowledge of its existence.\u00a0 It was only when\u00a0 the accused herself was\u00a0 about\u00a0 to be searched\u00a0 that\u00a0 she relinquished possession and control of the drug in an effort to\u00a0 protect herself against the consequences of the search.\u00a0 Rather than indicate that anyone else had knowledge of her possession of the drug, the proofs seem to suggest that\u00a0 it was her effort\u00a0 to\u00a0 keep knowledge of\u00a0 such\u00a0 possession\u00a0 from every other person, including Valeriano and his family.<\/p><p>The fact that Valeriano refused the\u00a0 officers permission to search his house for opium\u00a0 can\u00a0 not be taken\u00a0 against him.\u00a0\u00a0 No\u00a0 public official or other person in any country where that portion of the Constitution of the United States against searches and\u00a0 seizures or similar provision\u00a0 is in force, has the right to enter the premises of another without his consent for the purpose of search or seizure without first being1 provided with the proper\u00a0 search\u00a0 warrant for the purpose, obtained in the\u00a0 manner provided by law. (Sec. 5 of the Act\u00a0 of Congress of July 1, 1902; sees. 95, 96, 97, and 98 of the Code of Criminal\u00a0 Procedure.)\u00a0\u00a0 Judge Cooley, in his Constitutional\u00a0 Limitations, sixth edition, say at\u00a0 page 364 and following pages:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"Near in\u00a0 importance\u00a0 to exemption\u00a0 from any arbitrary control of the person is that maxim of the common law which secures\u00a0 to the citizen immunity in his home against the prying eyes of the government, and protection\u00a0 in person, property, and papers against even the\u00a0 process of the law, except in\u00a0 a\u00a0 few specified cases.\u00a0 The\u00a0 maxim that 'every man's house is his castle' is made a part of our constitutional law in the clauses prohibiting unreasonable searches and seizures, and has always been looked\u00a0 upon as of high value to the citizen.<\/p><p> \"If in English history we\u00a0 inquire into the original occasion for these\u00a0 constitutional\u00a0 provisions, we shall probably find it in the abuse of executive authority, and in the\u00a0 unwarrantable\u00a0 intrusion of executive agents into the houses and among the private papers of individuals, in order to obtain evidence of political\u00a0 offenses either committed\u00a0 or designed.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *.<\/p><p>\"The history of this controversy should be read in connection with that in America immediately previous\u00a0 to\u00a0 the American Revolution, in regard to writs\u00a0 of assistance issued by\u00a0 the courts to the revenue\u00a0 officers, empowering them, in their discretion, to search suspected places for\u00a0 smuggled goods, and which Otis pronounced 'the worst instrument of arbitrary power, the most destructive of English liberty and the fundamental principles of law, that ever was found in an English law book;' since they placed 'the liberty of every man in the\u00a0 hands\u00a0 of every petty officer.'\u00a0 All\u00a0 these matters are now a long way in the past;\u00a0 but it has not been deemed unwise to repeat in the State constitutions, as well as in the Constitution\u00a0 of the United States, the principles\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 already settled in the common law upon this vital point in civil liberty.<\/p><p>\"For the service of criminal process, the houses of private parties are subject to be broken and entered under circumstances which are fully explained in the works on criminal law, and need not be enumerated here.\u00a0 And there are also cases where search-warrants are allowed to be issued, under which an officer may be protected\u00a0 in the like action.\u00a0 But as search-warrants are a species of process exceedingly arbitrary in character, and\u00a0 which ought not to be resorted to except for\u00a0 very urgent and\u00a0 satisfactory\u00a0 reasons,\u00a0 the rules of law which pertain to them are of more than ordinary strictness; and if the party acting under them expects legal protection, it is essential that these rules be carefully observed.<\/p><p align=\"center\">*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<\/p><p>\"The warrant\u00a0 is not allowed for the purpose\u00a0 of obtaining evidence of an intended crime; but only after lawful evidence of an offense actually committed.\u00a0 Nor\u00a0 even then is it allowable to invade one's privacy for the sole purpose of obtaining evidence against him, except in a few special cases where that which is the subject of the crime is supposed to be concealed, and the public or the complainant has an interest in it or in its destruction.\u00a0 Those special cases are familiar, and well understood in the law. Search-warrants have\u00a0 heretofore been allowed to search\u00a0 for stolen goods, for goods\u00a0 supposed to have\u00a0 been smuggled into\u00a0 the country in violation of the revenue laws, for implements of gaming or\u00a0 counterfeiting,\u00a0 for\u00a0 lottery tickets or prohibited liquors kept for sale contrary to law,\u00a0 for obscene books\u00a0 and papers\u00a0 kept\u00a0 for sale\u00a0 or circulation, and\u00a0 for powder or other explosive and dangerous material so kept as to endanger the public safety.\u00a0\u00a0 A statute which should permit the breaking and entering a man's\u00a0 house, and\u00a0 the examination of books and papers\u00a0 with a view to discover the evidence of crime, might\u00a0 possibly not be\u00a0 void on constitutional grounds in some other\u00a0 cases; but the power of the legislature to authorize a resort to this process is one which can properly be exercised only in extreme cases, and it is\u00a0 better often times that crimes should go unpunished than\u00a0 that the citizen should be liable to have his premises invaded, his desks broken open,\u00a0 his private books, letters, and papers exposed\u00a0 to prying curiosity, and to the misconstruction of ignorant and suspicious persons,\u00a0 and all this under the direction of a mere ministerial officer, who brings with\u00a0 him such assistants\u00a0 as he pleases, and who will select them more often with reference to physical strength and courage than to their sensitive\u00a0 regard to the rights and feelings of others.\u00a0\u00a0 To incline against the enactment\u00a0 of such\u00a0 laws is to incline to the side of safety.\u00a0\u00a0 In\u00a0 principle they\u00a0 are objectionable; in the mode of execution they are necessarily odious;\u00a0 and they tend to invite abuse and to cover the commission of crime.\u00a0\u00a0 We think it would generally be safe for the legislature to regard all those searches and seizures\u00a0 'unreasonable' which have hitherto\u00a0 been unknown to the law, and\u00a0 on that account\u00a0 to abstain from authorizing them,\u00a0 leaving parties and the public to the accustomed remedies.<\/p><p>\"We have said that if the officer follows the command of his warrant, he is protected; and this is so even when the complaint proves to have been unfounded.\u00a0 But\u00a0 if he exceed the\u00a0 command by searching\u00a0 in\u00a0 places not described therein, or by seizing persons or articles not commanded, he is not protected by the warrant, and can only justify himself as in other cases where\u00a0 he assumes to act without process.\u00a0\u00a0 Obeying\u00a0 strictly the command of his warrant, he may break open outer or inner doors, and his justification\u00a0 does not depend upon his\u00a0 discovering that for which he is to make search.<\/p><p>\"In\u00a0 other cases than those to which we have referred, and\u00a0 subject to the\u00a0 general police power of the State, the law favors the complete and undisturbed dominion of every man over his own premises, and protects him\u00a0 therein with such jealousy that he may defend his possession\u00a0 against intruders, in person or by his servants or guests, even to the extent of taking the\u00a0 life of the intruder, if that seem essential to the defense.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Judge Cooley in a note quotes the eloquent passage from Chatham's speech on General Warrants as follows (p. 364):<\/p><blockquote><p>\"The poorest man may, in his\u00a0 cottage, bid\u00a0 defiance to all the forces of the Crown.\u00a0 It may be frail; its roof may shake; the wind may blow through it; the storm may enter; the rain may enter;\u00a0 but the King of England may not enter; all his force dares not cross the\u00a0 threshold of the ruined tenement.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>In the case of McClurg <em>vs.<\/em> Brenton (123 Iowa, 368), the court, speaking of the right of an\u00a0 officer to enter a private house to search for stolen goods, said:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"The right of the citizen to occupy and enjoy his home, however mean or humble, free\u00a0 from\u00a0 arbitrary\u00a0 invasion and search, has for centuries been protected with the most solicitous care by\u00a0 every\u00a0 court\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 English-speaking world,\u00a0 from\u00a0 Magna Charta down to\u00a0 the present, and is embodied in every bill of rights defining the limits of governmental power in our own republic.<\/p><p>\"The mere fact that a man is an officer, whether of high or\u00a0 low degree, gives him no more right than is possessed by the ordinary private citizen to break in upon the privacy of\u00a0 a\u00a0 home and subject\u00a0 its occupants to the indignity of a search for the evidence of crime, without a legal warrant procured for that purpose.\u00a0 No amount of incriminating evidence, whatever its source, will supply the place of such warrant.\u00a0 At the closed door of the home, be it palace or hovel, even blood-hounds must wait till the law, by authoritative process, bids it open. Even with a warrant, the law of this state forbids a search in the nighttime, save upon a showing therefor, and upon special authority expressed in the writ.\u00a0 (Code, sec. 5555.)\u00a0\u00a0 A right thus carefully guarded by the statute as well as by the common law is not to be lightly disregarded.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>In the case of Bailey <em>vs.<\/em> Eagatz (50 Wis., 554), the court said:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"It is very questionable whether the defendant would, by virtue of his office as policeman, be justified in demanding an entrance into the plaintiff's house in the nighttime, and after the family had retired, even though the boy he claims he was\u00a0 looking\u00a0 for had been\u00a0 there.\u00a0 Having no warrant\u00a0 or\u00a0 authority for his arrest, we think\u00a0 he would not have been justified in going further\u00a0 than\u00a0 making a proper inquiry upon the subject, and requesting, in a proper manner, to be permitted to enter the house to make search. He was not in a position\u00a0 to demand an entrance.\u00a0 And as there\u00a0 is\u00a0 evidence\u00a0 tending to prove that the\u00a0 defendant demanded an entrance into the house, and that he entered against the\u00a0 will of the plaintiff, the court was not justified in saying, as a matter of law, that the defendant lawfully entered the house of the plaintiff.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Article 205 of the Penal\u00a0 Code of the Philippine Islands reads as follows:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"The penalties of suspension in its minimum and medium degrees and a fine of not less than 325 and not more than 8,250 pesetas shall be imposed upon the following persons:<\/p><p>\"1. Any public officer, other than a judicial officer, who, in the absence of the authority referred to in article 200 shall enter the dwelling of a Spaniard or of a\u00a0 foreigner without his\u00a0 consent.<\/p><p>\"2. Any public officer, other than a judicial officer, who. without authority of law or of some general regulation in force in the Philippine\u00a0 Islands,\u00a0 shall search the papers and effects in the dwelling of a Spaniard or of a foreigner, unless\u00a0 the owner shall have\u00a0 given his consent thereto.<\/p><p>\"If the papers and goods searched are not restored to their owner\u00a0 immediately\u00a0 thereafter, the penalty shall be that next higher in degree.<\/p><p>\"If the offense penalized\u00a0 in paragraphs 1 and\u00a0 2 of this article be committed in the nighttime, the penalty shall be suspension in its medium and maximum degrees and a fine of not\u00a0 less\u00a0 than 625 and not more\u00a0 than\u00a0 6,250 pesetas: <em>Provided, however<\/em>, That in cases falling within the second subdivision of paragraph two the penalty shall be\u00a0 that next higher\u00a0 in\u00a0 degree than\u00a0 the penalties\u00a0 designated\u00a0 in\u00a0 said paragraphs one and two.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Commenting on this article, Viada,\u00a0 in his Treatise on the Spanish Penal Code, says\u00a0 (vol. 2, p.\u00a0 130, etc.):<\/p><blockquote><p>\"Article 5 of the constitution of 1869 provided that no one should enter the domicile of a Spaniard or of a foreigner residing in Spain without his consent except in urgent cases of fire,\u00a0 flood, or some other similar danger, or in case\u00a0 of unlawful aggression\u00a0 proceeding from\u00a0 within, or\u00a0 for the purpose of rendering assistance\u00a0 to\u00a0 a\u00a0 person calling for help.\u00a0 Outside of these cases the entrance into the domicile of a Spaniard\u00a0 or of a foreigner could\u00a0 only be authorized by a competent judge and it could only be <em>effected in the daytime.<\/em>\u00a0 However, when an\u00a0 offender was caught in <em>flagrante delicto<\/em> and was pursued by the\u00a0 authorities or their agents,\u00a0 and he took refuge in his own domicile, the authorities or\u00a0 their agents could\u00a0 enter the premises for the sole purpose of arresting him; and if he\u00a0 should seek\u00a0 refuge in the domicile of another, it was necessary to first make a demand upon the occupant of the house.<\/p><p>\"That inviolability of the domicile,\u00a0 as\u00a0 provided in the aforesaid article of the constitution,\u00a0 is what paragraph\u00a0 1 of the said article came to protect by\u00a0 means of its penal sanction.<\/p><p>\"The constitution of 1876,\u00a0 now in\u00a0 force,\u00a0 provided,\u00a0 in regard\u00a0 to the inviolability of the domicile, only that: 'No one shall\u00a0 enter the domicile of a Spaniard\u00a0 or of a\u00a0 foreigner residing in Spain without his consent, <em>except in the cases and in the manner expressly provided by law.'<\/em><\/p><p>\"We find the same principle quoted <em>ad pedem litterae<\/em>\u00a0 in article 545 of the Code of Criminal Procedure now in force, article 550 of which has in\u00a0 part modified the\u00a0 provisions\u00a0 of the constitution of 1869 upon the subject by providing that the judge or tribunal taking cognizance of the cause\u00a0 may decree the\u00a0 entrance into and search of\u00a0 any closed building or place, or any part thereof,\u00a0 constituting the <em>domicile<\/em>\u00a0 of any Spaniard or foreigner residing in Spain, either during the day or <em>the nighttime,<\/em> if the urgency of the case should so require, in the cases\u00a0 enumerated in article 546, that is to say, when there is reason to believe that either\u00a0 the offender or the instruments of the crime, books, papers, or any other things which may serve as\u00a0 a clue to the discovery of the crime, might be found therein; but this, provided\u00a0 the interested party consents thereto\u00a0 as stated\u00a0 in article 6 of the constitution; or, in the absence of his consent,\u00a0 by virtue\u00a0 of an order of the court which must\u00a0 be immediately served upon the party affected thereby, within the twenty-four hours at the\u00a0 most after the issuance\u00a0 of such order.\u00a0 The\u00a0 order\u00a0 shall set\u00a0 out the grounds thereof and the judge must expressly\u00a0 state therein the particular building\" or place\u00a0 to be\u00a0 entered or\u00a0 searched\u00a0 and whether the entrance and\u00a0 search is\u00a0 to\u00a0 be\u00a0 made during the day\u00a0 or the nighttime, and the name of the officer or official who shall execute the order.\u00a0\u00a0 (Art.\u00a0 558 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.)\u00a0 It should be also borne in mind\u00a0 that, according to article 553 of the said code, police officials may now, on <em>their own authority<\/em> and, therefore, without the necessity of a special order of the court, make any search and, hence, enter any inhabited place when a warrant\u00a0 has been issued for the arrest of any\u00a0 person\u00a0 and\u00a0 his\u00a0 capture\u00a0 is sought;

Safont and Puig the sum of P2,727.30, besides the interest due thereon at the rate of 15 per cent per annum until the debt shall have been completely paid. No express finding is made as to costs.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Mamerta Banal made no appeal whatever from the judgment, nor from any finding therein concerning her. It was the defendants, Safont and Puig, who appealed from the said judgment.<br\/><br\/>The Supreme Court affirmed the judgment appealed from, and, with respect to the preinserted finding concerning the defendant Banal, the affirmance is expressed in these terms:<br\/><blockquote>\"2. That Mamerta Banal, in that double character (in her own right and as the successor in interest of her deceased-daughter, Juana David) must pay, as the repurchase price, the amount for the payment of which she was sentenced.\u00a0\u00a0 The judgment as to this part is final.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Since she had not appealed).\u00a0 <\/blockquote>On August 18, 1908, the trial court issued the following order:<br\/><blockquote>\"Observe, comply with and carry out the orders of the Supreme Court in the preceding certified judgment, and let the proceedings follow their proper course for the purpose of due compliance therewith.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>On January 2, 1909, the plaintiff deposited with the clerk of the court \u00a32,727.30 together with the interest thereon at 15 per cent per annum from the date of the order above cited, that is, from August 18, 1908, amounting to P152.28.<br\/><br\/>The defendants protested that the interest was owing from July 1, 1903, and claimed that from that date to December 31, 1908, it amounted, at 15 per cent per annum, to P2,250.02; so that, the plaintiff having deposited but P152.28, there was still a shortage of P2,097.74.<br\/><br\/>The court, after certain incidental rulings, decided that the plaintiff must pay to Messrs. Safont and Puig P2,097.74, as the balance Of the interest, and that the proper writ of execution should issue against the said plaintiff's property, in case of failure to pay the said sum within the period fixed of fifteen days.\u00a0\u00a0 The plaintiff appealed.<br\/><br\/>The question raised is as to how much Mamerta Banal should pay as interest at the rate of 15 per cent per annum for the sum of P2,727.30.<br\/><br\/>It will be noticed at once, from its amount, that the interest, payment of which is ordered in the judgment, is neither in default nor is it compensatory, but rigorously lucrative, in a word, that it is not legal interest or the result of a provision of the law, but a conventional interest or the result of the express will of the parties in a contract.<br\/><br\/>From October 5, 1897, Mamerta Banal and Juana David, under a signed contract, went on paying 15 per cent interest upon the balance which they were owing on the account between them and Safont and Puig. Until the plaintiff, Mamerta Banal, filed her suit, the conventional interest of 15 per cent continued to run, and neither in the complaint nor during the trial was there any contention or doubt raised as to the obligation to pay the 15 per cent per annum on the amount which constituted a real balance of account; it was only this balance that was the subject of discussion, and suit had been brought solely in connection with such balance, in order to determine whether it existed or not, and, in an affirmative case, what was its amount.<br\/><br\/>The court determined that on July 1, 1903, there existed against the plaintiff a balance of P2,727.30, and ordered the payment of this balance, together with the annual interest thereon of 15 per cent. The only point endeavored to be ascertained was the true balance, not the interest due on the balance to be determined.<br\/><br\/>The amount of this balance was admitted and allowed by the plaintiff, and also the payment of the interest thereon at 15 per cent per annum. And; although she had not given such assent in accepting the judgment, it not having been a subject of litigation, as it was a stipulation covenanted in an undisputed instrument, valid and effective, the said interest would have continued to run from the date aforementioned of October 5,1897, because from that date to December 31, 1908, there was no break in the continuity of the obligation to pay it,\u00a0 - an obligation freely contracted by the plaintiff, Mamerta Banal, in her instrument of debt.<br\/><br\/>The issue, then, concerns, this conventional interest of 15 per cent: First, from July 1, 1903, the date when the balance was judicially declared to exist and was assented to by the plaintiff, Banal; second, from the date of the judgment of the lower court in which the final balance of P2,727.30 was determined, which date was the 15th of February, 1907; third, from the 18th of August, 1908, the date of the order for the execution of the decision of the Supreme Court, until December 31 of the same year.<br\/><br\/>The question involved in the third period does not concern this court at the present time. The plaintiff, now the appellant; acquiesced in the payment of the interest of 15 per cent per annum on that balance, from August 18, 1908, and she paid it, as well as the principal of P2,727.30.<br\/><br\/>But the appellees demand the interest for the intermediate period from July 1, 1903, to August 18, 1908, and, if the force of a contract and the execution of a judgment are not to be violated, a good reason must be given to exempt the appellant from the obligation to pay it.<br\/><br\/>As for the interest which ran from February 15, 1907, to August 18, 1908, the second point in issue, the reason given by the appellant is that it was the defendants' fault in appealing from the judgment, and that all this time elapsed through such fault.<br\/><br\/>This reason is not acceptable. If the appellant, in assenting to the judgment, had duly deposited the principal of P2,727.30 and its corresponding interest, she evidently would not have run the risk of this capital not bearing interest during that intermediate period, and, obviously, this risk would have been run by the defendants through their fault in having appealed and allowed all the time of the appeal to have elapsed with the principal in their possession or duly deposited to secure the payment.<br\/><br\/>But if the principal acknowledged to be owing is not returned or reimbursed, and draws interest either by reason of a contract or as a result of the judgment acquiesced in, the right to collect this interest is not interrupted during the time of the appeal. There is no law or doctrine which authorizes such an interruption, and in fact no case has ever been recorded where the indebtedness of interest was interrupted from the time of the filing of the appeal from the judgment in first instance to that of the execution of the decision rendered in second instance.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the first point, that is, the interest from July 1,1903, to February 15,1907, the reason alleged by the appellant is that she should, not pay interest for the sum of P2,727,S0, on account of its not being a loan, but the price fixed in the judgment for a repurchase.<br\/><br\/>Neither is this reason acceptable. If it were, as she Alleges, the now appellant ought to have appealed from the previous judgment whereby she was sentenced to pay not only that principal but also the interest due thereon at the rate of 15 per cent per annum, and then she would have had an opportunity to explain whether the said sum was merely the price fixed for a repurchase, The appellant, moreover, can not turn against her own acts, such as having: assented to the judgment with respect to the payment of the said interest, and the payment already made by her of the interest which ran from August 18 to the end of December, 1908.<br\/><br\/>The reasons governing the payment of the interest for the period from August 18 to December 31, 1908, are precisely the same as those that induced her to pay it for the periods embraced within February 15, 1907, to August 18, 1908, and July 1, 1903, to February 15, 1907. The force of this obligation has in no wise changed since October, 1897.<br\/><br\/>If the defendants had not appealed and the plaintiff, now the appellant, after assenting to the judgment, had endeavored forthwith to comply with the same, she well would have understood what the interest was at 15 per cent which she was sentenced to pay, together with the payment of the sum of P12,727.30. It\" could not have been that which ran subsequently, from August 18 to December 31,1908, nor that from February 15,1907, to August 18,1908, because neither the one nor the other would then have existed. It could have been no other than that which was due according to the findings of fact in the judgment assented to.<br\/><br\/>And the findings of fact in the judgment assented to by the appellant, are (1) that, for the consideration expressed, she was owing, as principal and interest, for the period from July 1, 1902, to June 30, 1903, the sum of 6,477.76 pesos (B. of E., pp. 8 and 9); (2) that from this amount a deduction should be made in the plaintiff's favor, also as principal and interest, of 2,929.27 pesos (B. of EM p. 10); and (3) that on July 1, 1903, the plaintiff was found to be owing 3,545 pesos and 49 centavos, or, in Philippine currency, P2,727.30 (B. of E.,p. 10).<br\/><br\/>If the conclusion of fact of the trial court, with respect to the liquidation comprehensive of one year's interest, from July 1, 1902, to June 30,1903, is a thing assented to by the plaintiff, and determines the sentence contained in the judgment for a principal of P2,727.30, the conclusion of law of the same court that the said principal of P2,727.30 must be paid \"in addition to the interest due on the said sum at the rate of 15 per cent per annum until complete payment of the said debt shall have been made,\" implies the same conclusion of fact as set forth in the judgment; and, therefore, the sentence to pay the interest due, as expressed in the judgment, implies a liquidation, month by month, the same as that for the periods from July 1,1902, to June 30,1903, from July 1, 1903, to June 30, 1904, from July 1, 1904, to June 30, 1905, and so onj successively, up to December 31, 1908, the interest for the last four months of which, in addition to that for thirteen days of the month of August of the same year, the appellant has already paid.<br\/><br\/>If, according to section 133 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the findings of fact are essential in judgments on questions of fact and those requisite to a clear understanding of the same must be set forth for the clear understanding of the interest due on the principal of P2,727.30, mentioned in the dispositive part of the sentence, in consonance with the finding of law in the judgment, expressive of the opinion of the trial judge on the questions of the liquidation of accounts, decided at the trial, from which this second appeal is derived, then the determination of the interest due, in conformity with the findings of fact of the judgment which precede the sentence, can not but be pertinent to the said dispositive part of the judgment, as an explanation embodied therein ; and the judgment is not changed, modified or altered, as the appellant claims, by the explanation made by the judge, for the proper fulfillment of the judgment, in the writ of execution he issues, saying: \"that is, the sum of P2,097.74 as an unpaid part of the interest due on P2,727.80,\" which is the judicial order impugned in the present appeal; it is an order, explanation or determination that is strictly within his jurisdiction in the suit as implicitly contained in the dispositive part of the judgment, oh account of its being explicitly embodied in the findings of fact in the judgment, and it is an axiom of law that what is implicit is not vitiated by what is explicit. therefore, the judgment appealed from is affirmed with the costs of this instance against the appellant.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres,\u00a0 Mapa<\/i>, and <i>Johnson, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><br\/><br\/><hr align=\"center\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><br\/><center><br\/><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">DISSENTING<\/span><br\/><\/center> <br\/><br\/><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">MORELAND,<\/span><i style=\"font-weight: bold;\"> J<\/i><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">., <\/span><br\/><br\/>The question presented to us for decision on this appeal was before the court below when the case was there on trial. It was there litigated, argued, and decided. The same question was presented to this court on the appeal direct from the judgment of the trial court, and that judgment was affirmed after full consideration of all the questions presented. The judgment of affirmance became final August 18, 1908, and proceedings were begun in the lower court immediately to collect it. The same question is again presented to this court on this appeal, which is one from an order entered in the proceedings to collect the judgment, as was litigated, argued, and decided in the original action. This court now by this decision relitigates the same question and, in effect, reverses the decision of the trial court, and of this court, years after the judgment in which said question was settled became final. Under this and other decisions of this court a judgment in the Philippine Islands has lost its most valuable quality, that of putting an end to litigation -\u00a0 of being final.<br\/><\/div>",

Evangelista contracted his second marriage with Antonia Alonso, there elapsed more than twelve\u00a0 years and eight months, during: which time Santiago G. Evangelista had by this same Antonia Alonso, he being a widower and she a spinster, five children, named Emiliano, Ygnacia,\u00a0 Pedro, Ambrosio and Luisa, all of them having the status of\u00a0 natural children,\u00a0 the first born on February 9, 1867, and\u00a0 the last, on June 21, 1876. During his marriage with this woman, he had three other children, Quintin, Juan and Graciana; making a total of eight children.<\/p><p>By the third marriage,\u00a0 with Pilar Salunga, he had five children:\u00a0 Rosario, Natividad, Honorio, Jose and Virginia, not including another daughter who died before her father. Santiago Cancitier Evangelista died on March 10, 1895.<\/p><p>The following facts are undisputed: First, that at the dissolution of the second marriage there was conjugal property valued at P41,539; and, second, that at the death of Santiago Canciller Evangelista, he left from his third marriage conjugal property worth P46,234.<\/p><p>Of the children of the second marriage, the first five were all, at their father's death, of legal age, but the last three had not\u00a0 yet\u00a0 attained their majority and because of their being minors,\u00a0 remained subject to the guardianship of their elder brother\u00a0 Emiliano, under the surveillance of a protutor and the authority of a family council, in accordance with the provisions\u00a0 of the\u00a0 Civil Code,\u00a0 which was then in force.\u00a0 The\u00a0 five children\u00a0 of the last\u00a0 marriage were\u00a0 all minors;\u00a0 but\u00a0 at their father's death,\u00a0 they were not placed under guardianship, inasmuch as,\u00a0 in the absence of their father, in conformity with the provisions of the Civil Code, they remained subject to\u00a0 the parental\u00a0 authority of their mother, Pilar Salunga.<\/p><p>Emiliano C. Evangelista, as guardian, was the legal representative of\u00a0 his two\u00a0 brothers, Quintin\u00a0 and Juan,\u00a0 and his\u00a0 sister Graciana; and Pilar\u00a0 Salunga, by virtue\u00a0 of\u00a0 her parental\u00a0 authority, was\u00a0 the legal representative of\u00a0 all\u00a0 her five minor children.<\/p><p>Santiago C.\u00a0 Evangelista having died without leaving a will, judicial proceedings were begun for\u00a0 the\u00a0 purpose of having his above named children declared to be his intestate heirs.\u00a0 This\u00a0 action\u00a0 was initiated, jointly\u00a0 and in perfect accord, by the\u00a0 eight children of the second marriage\u00a0 and Pilar Salunga,\u00a0 as\u00a0 the\u00a0 legal representative\u00a0 of her five children, and\u00a0 all these\u00a0 children\u00a0 were declared by the court, by order of September 26, 1895, to be the intestate heirs of Santiago C. Evangelista.\u00a0 As\u00a0 aforestated, the public instrument of partition\u00a0 was signed before a notary,\u00a0 on\u00a0 the 23d of the following month of October,\u00a0 by\u00a0 the children of the second marriage,\u00a0 who were of\u00a0 age, by Emiliano C. Evangelista, in his own right and as the legal representative and protutor of his\u00a0 aforesaid two brothers\u00a0 and sister,\u00a0 and by Pilar Salunga, in her own right and in representation of her minor\u00a0 children.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 instrument of\u00a0 partition is Exhibit A of the complaint.<\/p><p>The copy of the instrument, Exhibit A, was taken from a record kept in the existing registry, and in\u00a0 transcribing this copy the error was inadvertently made of setting down that the\u00a0 first\u00a0 wife\u00a0 of Santiago C. Evangelista died \"on January\u00a0 eighteenth, eighteen\u00a0 hundred\u00a0 and seventy-five.\" So that the children born, Emiliano, in 1867, Ignacia, in 1868, Pedro, in 1870, and Ambrosio, in 1871, could not have been born as natural\u00a0 but as illegitimate children, having been conceived by their mother, Antonia\u00a0 Alonso, through intercourse with a man who was then married.\u00a0 But\u00a0 the death\u00a0 certificate was presented,\u00a0 which expresses the true date;\u00a0 \"the eighteenth\u00a0 of January,\u00a0 eighteen hundred and <em>sixty-<\/em>five\" (Exhibit 1), and the\u00a0 plaintiffs' attorney expressly stated that he had no objection\u00a0 whatever to its\u00a0 introduction in evidence.<\/p><p>In February, 1907, twelve years after the partition had been made, this complaint was\u00a0 filed attacking it as null and void and\u00a0 it is\u00a0 the widow who\u00a0 presented the complaint in her own behalf. She directed it against all the children of her deceased husband, including those whom\u00a0 she\u00a0 had by him;\u00a0 but afterwards Honorio,\u00a0 Jose and Virginia, children of Pilar Salunga,\u00a0 represented\u00a0 by their guardian ad litem, Emiliano Kerr, joined in the complaint and were also admitted as plaintiffs.<\/p><p>Subsequently, another daughter,\u00a0 Natividad Evangelista, assisted by her husband,\u00a0 Gualberto Santos, joined in the complaint and was also admitted as a plaintiff.\u00a0 The child who did not join with her mother in the suit was the\u00a0 other daughter, Rosario, likewise\u00a0 married.\u00a0 So that\u00a0 Pilar Salunga, with four of her children\u00a0 of the last marriage, attacks the eight\u00a0 children\u00a0 of the second marriage.<\/p><p>The first question of nullity raised by\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiffs is that of the first five children of the second marriage,\u00a0 Emiliano,\u00a0 Ignacia, Pedro,\u00a0 Ambrosio\u00a0 and Luisa, having taken part in the inheritance, they being neither the legitimate nor the legitimized children-of\u00a0 Santiago C. Evangelista,<\/p><p>They shared in the inheritance because, although they were born as natural children, yet later, through the subsequent marriage of Santiago C.\u00a0 Evangelista with their mother Antonia Alonso, they became, by provision of law and\u00a0 by such posterior marriage, ipso jure legitimized children and their condition was exactly equal, in the eyes of the law, to that of legitimate children, in so far as their right to inherit from their father is concerned.\u00a0\u00a0 But the plaintiffs also deny that they are the natural children of Santiago C. Evangelista.<\/p><p>The Court of First Instance, upon the trial, decided this first question in the sense that the five said defendants were the natural children of Santiago G. Evangelista, were legitimized afterwards by the subsequent marriage of the latter with his second spouse, Antonia Alonso, undoubtedly their mother, and that they had the same right to inherit from their father which the plaintiffs\u00a0 recognized\u00a0 as\u00a0 belonging to the other three children had by Santiago G. Evangelista during his marriage with Antonia Alonso; and the grounds of its judgment are: first, that with respect to the third of the said children, Ambrosio, there is documentary proof in the record that he is a natural son of the spouses Santiago and Antonia; second, that with regard to all these children, the best and most conclusive proof is the judicial order of September 26, 1395, which declared them to be the heirs of Santiago G. Evangelista, jointly and upon equal shares with the legitimate children; third, that the legal presumption\u00a0 is that, in the proceedings in which that order was issued, all the required legal\u00a0 formalities were\u00a0 observed, and that the court based its ruling on the evidence adduced therein; and, fourth, that the constant possession\u00a0 of the surname Evangelista, the fact of their always having lived in their father's house, and that of the latter's\u00a0 having maintained and educated them at his expense, indicate a recognition on his part; .not the Civil Gode, but the laws prior to the same being applicable in judging of this matter.<\/p><p>We find this judgment to be in accordance with the law, in so far as the first question is\u00a0 concerned, which is still insisted upon in this second instance, the plaintiffs alleging in their appeal that the lower court erred by not excluding from among the heirs of the deceased Santiago C. Evangelista, the five aforementioned defendants; but\u00a0 we find sufficient grounds in the judicial order of September 26, 1895, cited in the judgment and whose effectiveness must be given due weight in the present decision, to induce us to decide against this assignment of error.<\/p><p>By this judicial order were brought to a close the proceedings that were initiated by those who, in the matter of the estate of Santiago C. Evangelista, were interested in being declared to be his heirs so that they might obtain extrajudicially a valid partition of his estate.<\/p><p>The proceedings just mentioned were carried out in conformity with the provisions of the Ley de Enjuiciamiento civil, or law of civil procedure, then in force, to wit, the following:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"Art. 962. The intestate heirs who are descendants of the deceased, may obtain a declaration of their right by proving, by means of the proper documents or of such other proof as be available, the death of the person whose succession is in question and their relationship to him, and by testimony of witnesses, that such\u00a0 person died without leaving a will, and that they or those whom they designate are his sole heirs.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"Art. 963. The said testimony shall be taken after summoning the\u00a0 promotor\u00a0 fiscal, or prosecuting attorney, if there be\u00a0 one, to whom\u00a0 the record shall\u00a0 afterwards be submitted for six days in\u00a0 order that he\u00a0 may\u00a0 render an opinion upon the matter.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"Art. 964. The aforementioned proceedings having been had, (those specified in the preceding articles), the judge, without further\u00a0 procedure, shall issue an order acceding to, or denying the petition for a declaration of intestate heirs, as he may deem proper; in the latter case he shall reserve the petitioner's right for its determination after trial.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"This order shall be appealable in any event.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The evidence shows that Pilar Salunga, in her own right and as the legal representative of her children, was one of those who presented\u00a0 the\u00a0 petition for the declaration\u00a0 of heirs; that the prosecuting attorney of the court was heard; that neither the latter official nor the plaintiff Salunga offered any objection whatever to the documentary and oral evidence which was produced by the other children of the second marriage, whose filiation is now impugned, to prove their relationship with the deceased;\u00a0 and that the court, in view of all the evidence introduced, held:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"That he should declare and did declare the legitimate children of Don Santiago Canciller Evangelista, namely, Don Emiliano, Dona Ignacia, Don Ambrosio, Don Pedro, Dofia Luisa, Don Quintin, Don\u00a0 Juan, and Dona Graciana Canciller Evangelista y Alonso, had by his wife, Dofia Antonia Alonso, in\u00a0 second wedlock, and his children Rosario, Natividad, Honorio, Jose and Virginia, had by his wife, Dofia Maria Pilar Salunga,\u00a0 in third wedlock, to be the\u00a0 intestate heirs of the said Don\u00a0 Santiago Canciller Evangelista.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Had Maria Pilar Salunga then made, as she had opportunity to\u00a0 do, the opposition\u00a0 she now does, the judge would have denied the petition\u00a0 presented by the first five children of the second marriage for a declaration of <em>intestate<\/em> heirs and would have reserved their\u00a0 right for determination, through the proper proceedings, and they\u00a0 then could have brought such proceedings,\u00a0 wherein ample\u00a0 discussion could have been had of all that is now discussed;\u00a0 but the declaration of intestate heirs\u00a0 was not denied and was made, pursuant to the petition of the said five children in agreement with the others and\u00a0 with Pilar Salunga, the present plaintiff; and, as\u00a0 they all\u00a0 consented,\u00a0 including Pilar Salunga, to the said declaration, and did not avail themselves of the right to appeal allowed by law,\u00a0 the said judicial order became final,\u00a0 just as a judgment rendered\u00a0 in a declaratory action, in case of a denial of the petition, would have become final, and neither the said judicial order nor the declaration made in its dispositive\u00a0 part may subsequently be impugned. Although\u00a0 it is merely an\u00a0 order\u00a0 issued in\u00a0 proceedings in Voluntary jurisdiction, the ruling of September 26, 1895, declarative of the status of legitimate children and favorable to the five defendants, whose filiation is now impugned, once it\u00a0 was\u00a0 consented\u00a0 to\u00a0 and\u00a0 became final, is now <em>res adjudicata<\/em>\u00a0 as against\u00a0 Pilar\u00a0 Salunga and all\u00a0 the other children of Santiago C. Evangelista who\u00a0 took part in the judicial proceeding.<\/p><p>If the said j udicial ruling of September 26,\u00a0 1895, declarative of filiation and of the status of legitimate heirs, had been rendered in an ordinary trial, such as would have been had if the order,\u00a0 instead\u00a0 of\u00a0 decreeing,\u00a0 had\u00a0 denied such filiation\u00a0 and such\u00a0 status of heir,\u00a0 alleged in that judicial proceeding, it not\u00a0 only would\u00a0 become,\u00a0 as against Pilar Salunga and the rest of the children of Santiago\u00a0 C. Evangelista, <em>res adjudicata,<\/em> but would have been final by reason of the provision\u00a0 contained in the second paragraph of article 1252 of the Civil Code,\u00a0 according to which\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"In questions relating to the civil status of\u00a0 persons, and in those regarding the validity or nullity of testamentary provisions, the presumption of <em>res\u00a0 adjudicata<\/em> shall be valid against third persons, even if they should not have litigated.\"<\/p><p>\"In questions\u00a0 that relate\u00a0 to civil status - says Manresa\u2014 and among them enter those of paternity and filiation, of the validity of marriages, declarations of\u00a0 incapacity, etc., the position and, sometimes, the legal capacity of\u00a0 a person, the basis of all juridic life,\u00a0 is determined wherein separate applications must not be made by distinguishing that the interested\u00a0 person lacks the capacity to treat with some persons and is competent to treat with others, or vice-versa, for the sole reason of the former having litigated\u00a0 while the latter have not.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (8 Manresa, Commentaries on\u00a0 the Civil Code, 558 and 559.)<\/p><\/blockquote><p><\/p><p>Although the authority of <em>res adjudicata<\/em>, aforementioned, is limited, as having been acquired in\u00a0 a proceeding in voluntary jurisdiction, what may not\u00a0 be denied is that the said judicial\u00a0 ruling is entirely effective\u00a0 against all who took part in the said proceeding in voluntary\u00a0 jurisdiction, as did Pilar Salunga and the children of Santiago\u00a0 C. Evangelista, and is like a judgment that has assumed the authority of <em>res adjudicate <\/em>and none of them may afterwards discuss the same question in an ordinary trial, provided by law in case of an adverse ruling on the petition or for all such persons as may have been unable to take part in the said proceeding:, or any other in the matter of a declaration of\u00a0 the intestate heirs of the\u00a0 predecessor-in-interest to a hereditary succession.\u00a0 Once that the judicial orders and rulings have become final, by being consented to through the proper remedies not having\u00a0 been invoked against them, they\u00a0 become\u00a0 <em>res\u00a0 adjudicata<\/em>.\u00a0 (Decision\u00a0 of the\u00a0 supreme court of Spain of November 13, 1895.)<\/p><p>The legal presumption stands, so long as the contrary is not proven,\u00a0 that\u00a0 the judge\u00a0 would not have made that declaration of children and of heirs, if during\u00a0 the course of the proceeding it had not been sufficiently proven, to his satisfaction and with the approval of the prosecuting attorney \"who rendered an opinion favorable to the petition,\" as shown\u00a0 by the record: first, that the five aforementioned defendants were natural children; second, that\u00a0 they were recognized by Santiago Canciller Evangelista, expressly or tacitly (a tacit recognition\u00a0 being\u00a0 then sufficient pursuant to the very famous Law 11 of Toro) as children of his own had with her\u00a0 who\u00a0 afterwards became his second\u00a0 wife, Antonia Alonso; third, that he subsequently married the latter, which even in this trial has been fully proven; fourth, that, by\u00a0 operation of the law, the mere fact of the subsequent marriage made those children legitimate; and, fifth, that, by an express provision of the law, the children legitimized by a subsequent marriage were entirely equal to legitimate children with respect to the quality of heirs by force of law, and were the legitimate children of him who engendered and recognized them, and he could not have denied them as his children and heirs, if he had made a will.\u00a0 All these facts and conclusions of law having been assented to by Pilar Salunga, in her double personality aforestated, may she now repudiate such acts of hers judicially performed? May her\u00a0 children, then legally represented\u00a0 by her, now disown, under the pretext that they were minors, what was consented to by, and awarded in judgment to, their legal representative?<\/p><p>It is\u00a0 beyond all doubt that Pilar Salunga,\u00a0 in her\u00a0 own personality, that is, in her own right as widow with respect to her half of the community property, can not deny or attack the legal personality of those with whom she executed the contract of partition; this doctrine is firmly established in civil jurisprudence.\u00a0 So that her suit can not prosper on account of this principle. The first question of her appeal is decided against her, in the sense that the five defendants, whose affiliation and right to inherit she now seeks to disown and impugn, are and\u00a0 must be legitimate children and heirs of Santiago C. Evangelista, as they were declared to be by a final order assented to\u00a0 by herself and which has acquired the authority of <em>res adjudicata.<\/em><\/p><p>The result is: that Pilar Salunga\u00a0 may in\u00a0 no manner repudiate the contract of partition by virtue of which she accepted as her half of the conjugal assets, the properties, valued at P23,117, that were adjudicated to her, as set forth on page 43 of her Exhibit A.<\/p><p>With respect to her children, then minors, inasmuch as it is a controvertible point as\u00a0 to\u00a0 whether that declaratory order of September 26,1895, is binding upon them, that is, whether they must abide by what was therein declared as being <em>res adjudicata<\/em>, we will suppose that they are not obliged to do so; rather, on\u00a0 the contrary, that they still possess the right of action for the disavowal of the filiation and quality of heirs declared in that order, in behalf of the five defendants concerned in this matter.<\/p><p>Of Pilar Salunga's children, then minors, Rosario, as well as her husband Tomas Olson, was declared to be in default (p. 52\u00a0 of the\u00a0 record), and Natividad, Honorio, Jose and Virginia joined in the complaint\u00a0 and\u00a0 were represented, Natividad, by her husband Gualberto Santos, and the other three, by their guardian <em>ad litem<\/em>, Emiliano Kerr.\u00a0 Hence, the only true plaintiffs, with respect to this first question, are the four children of Pilar\u00a0 Salunga, named Natividad, Honorio, Jose, and Virginia, to whom, jointly with Rosario, property to the value of P16,591.15 was adjudicated.\u00a0\u00a0 (Id.)<\/p><p>The entire opposition consists, briefly, in the fact that the baptismal\u00a0 and\u00a0 birth certificates\u00a0 do not state that they are the natural children of\u00a0 Santiago C. Evangelista, and in the averment that there is\u00a0 no\u00a0 proof that\u00a0 the latter lived conjugally with Antonia Alonso.\u00a0 All this is presumed to be proven\u00a0 in that judicial proceeding.\u00a0 What the plaintiffs should have proved, after said judicial declaration, is that they did not possess the status of natural children and could not be recognized as such, and that, consequently, they could not acquire the condition of children legitimized by\u00a0 a subsequent marriage.<\/p><p>Against\u00a0 these true plaintiffs are the grounds of the judgment, aforementioned, which are in thorough harmony with the\u00a0 facts proved at trial and the legal provisions bearing on the matter, such provisions being understood to be those which governed at the time of the birth of the said children, and not those of the Civil Code, which was then not\u00a0 yet in force and\u00a0 under which,\u00a0 nevertheless,\u00a0 all the\u00a0 contentions of the complaint are made.<\/p><p>Pursuant to\u00a0 Rule 1 of the transitory provisions of the Civil Code, \"rights arising under the legislation prior to this code, out of matters\u00a0 carried out under its rules,\u00a0 shall be governed by such\u00a0 prior legislation, even if the code should regulate them in another manner, or does not recognize the same;\" so that the status of natural children, of the children whose filiation is impugned, the recognition of such children and their\u00a0 rights, including hereditary rights,\u00a0 can\u00a0 not, because of their having arisen from acts done prior to the enactment\u00a0 of the\u00a0 code, be governed\u00a0 in any other manner than by the legislation prior to the code, and on such legislation is based the judicial opinion contained in the said findings of\u00a0 the judgment which are reproduced and adopted in this decision.<\/p><p>The provision of article 1081 of the Civil Code, providing for the nullity of a partition made with a person who was believed to be an heir without being so, has no application to the present case, because it is not only a supposition that the said five defendants were heirs, but they really were so and are so,\u00a0 according to the trial had at that time and to the evidence then and now adduced, and no error whatever has been shown, either in the order of September 26, 1895, or in the partition of October of the same year,\u00a0 or in any of the many proceedings, both\u00a0 judicial and extra judicial, in which the five defendants, whose rights are now in discussion, were always held to be true natural children legitimized by a subsequent marriage.<\/p><p>The second\u00a0 question raised\u00a0 by the plaintiffs in\u00a0 their appeal is that relating to the nullity of the\u00a0 partition, on account of the damage alleged to have been suffered by the minor children of Pilar Salunga.<\/p><p>The trial\u00a0 court decided it in a negative sense.\u00a0 There is, says the court, absolutely no proof that the said minors suffered damage to the extent of more than the fourth part. It has not been proved what was the value of the property when it was adjudicated.\u00a0 In determining said value,\u00a0 the plaintiffs took as appraisement the purchase prices.\u00a0\u00a0 If the value of the property of an\u00a0 estate, were always\u00a0 the price at which it was acquired, the appraisement of the same by experts would really be needless.\u00a0 Moreover, the proper action in this case is not one of nullity, but one of indemnity for the damage caused, or the heirs may consent to a new partition; in accordance with article 1077 of the Civil Code. <b. e.=\"\" of=\"\" p.=\"\"><\/b.><\/p><p>All these\u00a0 findings are in. strict agreement with the facts proven at trial, and with the law.<\/p><p>It is\u00a0 an evident fact that this question does not in\u00a0 the least affect either the\u00a0 eight children of the second marriage or the widow, Pilar Salunga, or the defendant in default, Bosario C. Evangelista.\u00a0\u00a0 The plaintiffs, at the end of\u00a0 the trial, amended the complaint and only then alleged that the appraisement\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 property caused\u00a0 \"great\u00a0 detriment to the interests of the minors, the herein plaintiffs,\" (B. of e. p. 15), and, more explicitly, in their brief:<\/p><p>\"That maliciously and to the detriment of the minors born <em>of the third marriage,<\/em> the property awarded to them was appraised at a price that exceeds by four or five times its true and just value, while, on the other hand, the property awarded to the\u00a0 children of the second marriage was appraised at a price which only reaches a fourth or fifth part of its true and just value\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.\"\u00a0 (Brief, p. 20.)<\/p><p>But it was not proved, as well said in the judgment, what was the value of the said property at the time of the appraisement, nor is it sufficient to advance the argument of the purchase price, because, were it so,\u00a0 it would have been useless to proceed with an appraisement of the property at the time of the partition.\u00a0\u00a0 It should have been proved at the trial that,\u00a0 in appraising the property,\u00a0 the subject of the partition, at a value greater or less than that stated in the titles of acquisition, the appraisers proceeded unjustly, or, as alleged in the brief, maliciously, inasmuch as at the time of the award or adjudication of the property the prices still remained the same, or because all the changes they made were not in harmony with the real facts, did not represent its value at the time.<\/p><p>The conclusion of the lower court is that it was not proven what was the value of the property when it was awarded; and this court finds no reasons to conclude otherwise.<\/p><p>There is\u00a0 absolutely no proof that the said minor suffered injury to the extent of more than the fourth part,\u00a0 so concludes the lower court; and we find no premises whereupon to establish a different conclusion or that that injury exceeding the fourth part, prejudicial to the minors of the third marriage, existed.<\/p><p>Supposing, for a moment, that such minors of the third marriage did\u00a0 really suffer\u00a0 \"injury\u00a0 exceeding the fourth part, taking into consideration the value of the things <em>at the time they were awarded,<\/em>\" which is the case prescribed by article 1074 of the Civil Code, withal, not on this account would there be reason to ask for the cancellation of the said partition.<\/p><p>The code does not allow the nullification of a partition, except in the case, before mentioned, of article 1081, that is, where the \"partition was made with a person who was believed to be an heir, without being so;\" for all the other cases in the articles 1074 to 1078,\u00a0 inclusive, the code only grants an action for rescission.\u00a0 And though, practically, in certain cases, nullity and rescission produce the same effects, in reality and in a strict sense of law they are distinct actions, inasmuch as an act that is null is supposed never to have existed, while the rescindable act is supposed to have been valid at its origin, though it afterwards became ineffective.<\/p><p>Although the injury alleged on the part of the minors of the third\u00a0 marriage, be a fact\u00a0 sufficiently\u00a0 proved in the manner required by law, the petition praying that the petition concerned be declared null or be annulled, is improper.<\/p><p>And were it asked that the said partition in its entirety be declared rescinded, such petition would also be improper, for two reasons:<\/p><p>One, because in paragraph 1 of article 1077, it is provided that \"a defendant heir may choose between indemnifying for the damage or consent to a new division;\" and the other, because paragraph 3 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 same\u00a0 article prescribes that \"if a new division is made it shall not include those who may not have been prejudiced nor those who did not receive more than was proper.\"<\/p><p>Only the four manors of the third' marriage, Natividad, Honorio, Jose and Virginia, whom it is alleged were prejudiced to the extent of more than the\u00a0 fourth part, are these who would be entitled to an indemnity for the injury they are supposed to have suffered; but Pilar Salunga could not, in her original complaint, nor can she in her amended complaint, properly ask that the\u00a0 partition be rescinded for a cause that does not affect her in the\u00a0 least, for the reason that she does not complain of injury because of the award that was made to her, neither does her daughter Rosario, nor do\u00a0 Santiago C.\u00a0 Evangelista's\u00a0 eight children of\u00a0 the second marriage.<\/p><p>The second\u00a0 question, therefore, can\u00a0 not but\u00a0 be decided adversely to the plaintiffs.\u00a0 The complaint is dismissed in so far as it concerns the declaration of nullity, asked for therein,\u00a0 of\u00a0 the partition, and is disallowed\u00a0 in so far as it has bearing on the rescission of the partition\u00a0 because of injury, which is what was probably meant to be asked for as the true\u00a0 object of the complaint,\u00a0 according to law.<\/p><p>The third question relates\u00a0 to the nullity of the said partition, on account of the failure to include in the inventory on which it was based, certain property then in the possession of some of the\u00a0 interested parties.<\/p><p>The trial court also decided this question\u00a0 adverse to the plaintiffs.\u00a0\u00a0 Neither would an action for nullity be proper here,\u00a0 said the court.\u00a0 This property should be included in the inventory and distributed in the same manner as was the rest.\u00a0\u00a0 (B. of e., p. 19.)<\/p><p>As already stated, an action for a declaration of nullity is improper except in the case specified in article 1081.<\/p><p>Neither\u00a0 is an\u00a0 action\u00a0 for rescission\u00a0 applicable.\u00a0 \"The omission,\" prescribes article 1079, \"of one or more objects or securities of the inheritance does not give\u00a0 rise to\u00a0 the rescission of the division\u00a0 by reason of <em>lesion<\/em>, but only to complete or increase the estate with the objects or securities omitted.\"\u00a0 The parties themselves who signed the contract of partition here concerned, stipulated therein that:<\/p><blockquote>\"If other property be discovered which belonged to\u00a0 the said deceased\u00a0 (the spouses\u00a0 Evangelista and Alonso)\u00a0 and is not comprised within this partition, a distribution thereof shall be made among the interested\u00a0 parties proportionately and in accordance with the common\u00a0 law.\"\u00a0 (Exhibit A, p. 53.)<p><\/p><\/blockquote><p>The fourth question refers to the nullity of the partition, for the reason\u00a0 that the minors were not duly represented therein.<\/p><p>The trial court elucidated\u00a0 this question, making a\u00a0 distinction\u00a0 between the minors\u00a0 of the second marriage\u00a0 and those of the third.<\/p><blockquote>\"With regard to those of the second marriage, said the court, it is of record that the protutor signed the instrument of partition, and, moreover, no action whatever is exercised here in their name, since they are now of age.\"\u00a0 (B. of e., p. 19.)<\/blockquote><p><\/p><p>In fact,\u00a0 those who were minors\u00a0 of the second marriage are Quintin, Juan and Graciana, and were born, the first in 1877, the second in 1879, and the third in 1880.\u00a0 In 1907, the date of the complaint, they were, respectively, 29, 28, and\u00a0 27 years of age.\u00a0 They\u00a0 being of age\u00a0 and their own masters\u00a0 and the only persons who\u00a0 might, if they chose, bring up this question,\u00a0 they\u00a0 did not institute\u00a0 any action whatever against the partition; nor is this defect of representation a radical vice which may be objected to by anyone\u00a0 except the\u00a0 party concerned.\u00a0\u00a0 Consequently,\u00a0 neither Pilar Salunga nor her children are entitled to prosecute this action for a declaration of nullity.<\/p><p>The findings of the judgment, respecting all these causes for nullification, are by the present decision affirmed.\u00a0 There is no basis for the nullification of\u00a0 the partition, since the five defendants, EmiJiano, Ygnacia,\u00a0 Ambrosio,\u00a0 Pedro and Luisa C. Evangelista\u00a0 took\u00a0 part therein\u00a0 and were, all of them, legitimate parties as the true children and legitimate heirs of the spouses Santiago\u00a0 C. Evangelista and Antonia Alonso.\u00a0 There are no grounds upon which to rescind the partition on account\u00a0 of\u00a0 the alleged damage to the\u00a0 extent of more than the fourth part of the property awarded to the minor\u00a0 children of Santiago C. Evangelista, had by Pilar Salunga, nor because of\u00a0 the failure to include in the inventory certain property\u00a0 which should form a part of the hereditary\u00a0 estate, nor because of undue representation of the minor children of the second marriage who, after they became of age, brought no action whatever.<\/p><p>Obviously, Pilar Salunga, in her own right, could show no reason nor authority in law why she should present, in her name, the complaint herein concerned, and much less the present appeal; wherefore this appeal of Pilar Salunga, who could have suffered no harm whatever from the judgment from which she appealed, is entirely improper.<\/p><blockquote>\"With respect to the children of Maria Pilar Salunga - continues the trial judge - the mother entered into the contract of\u00a0 Exhibit A, in her own behalf\u00a0 and\u00a0 in that of her minor children who were under her parental authority.\u00a0 It is evident that the mother who, in the absence of the father, exercises the parental authority over her minor children, is their representative; but, pursuant to article\u00a0 165 of the Civil Code, whenever, in\u00a0 any matter, the father or mother may have an interest opposed to that of their children, not emancipated, a next friend shall be appointed for the latter, to\u00a0 represent them in court or otherwise.\u00a0 In the partition in\u00a0 question, Maria Pilar Salunga was directly interested on account of her half of the conjugal property; she may be considered to have been a\u00a0 coheir; she could\u00a0 not represent her minor children, who\u00a0 needed a next friend to complete their\u00a0 personality.\u00a0 This\u00a0 case comes entirely\u00a0 within the provisions of article 1259 of the Civil Code, which prescribes that no one can contract\u00a0 in\u00a0 the name of another without being authorized by him\u00a0 or being his legal representative; a contract executed in the name of another by one who has neither his authorization nor legal\u00a0 representation, is\u00a0 void, unless it be ratified by the person in whose name it was executed before being revoked\u00a0 by\u00a0 the other contracting party.\u00a0\u00a0 This\u00a0 court holds\u00a0 that the contract under examination was not validated by\u00a0 the persons\u00a0 in whose names it was executed.\u00a0 The partition concerned is, therefore, null, through the lack of capacity on the part of the executrix to represent her minor children in the said partition.\u00a0 Prescription can not be invoked, and at all events the prescription was interrupted during the time\u00a0 that the courts of justice ceased to be in operation in this province, that is, for a period of\u00a0 more than three years, from June, 1898, to July, 1901.\"\u00a0 (B. of e., pp. 19 and 20.)<p><\/p><\/blockquote><p>The complaint not having prospered\u00a0 on the other preceding grounds, it was successful upon\u00a0 this last one, and the partition was finally declared to be null and void.\u00a0 The prescription set up against the complaint was\u00a0 found to be no bar, on account of the term not having been completed that the law requires to make it an effective defense.<\/p><p>The fourth question, in this\u00a0 part\u00a0 thereof, having been decided adversely to the defendants, the latter,\u00a0 in turn, appealed from the judgment and alleged, as assignments of error:\u00a0 <\/p><ol><li>The finding that there was an opposition\u00a0 of interests between the mother, Pilar Salunga, and her minor children, within the terms of article 165 of the Civil Code;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/><\/li>\u00a0 <li>The finding that Pilar Salunga was not vested with legal capacity to represent, in the partition, her minor children subject to her parental authority;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/><\/li>\u00a0 <li>The finding that her minor children should have completed their personality through a next friend, and that, as this was not done, article 1259 of the Civil Code must be applied;<br\/><\/li>\u00a0 <li>The finding that the contract of partition had not been validated by the mother who,\u00a0 in the name\u00a0 of her\u00a0 minor children, executed the ratification thereof; and<br\/>\u00a0 <\/li><li>The failure to sustain the prescription, or the finding that it had\u00a0 been interrupted.<\/li><\/ol><p>We shall take up the discussion of this last\u00a0 assignment of error in preference to the preceding ones, inasmuch as, if it is not sustained, the others should have to be judged accordingly.\u00a0\u00a0 Now, it\u00a0 has been shown that, not only witnesses\u00a0 of the defendants, but\u00a0 even Pilar Salunga herself, testified that, since the partition was\u00a0 made up\u00a0 to the time of the\u00a0 trial, each one of the heirs had been in possession of the land that had been awarded to him, which, up to the date of the complaint, had not been\u00a0 disturbed, either by her or by any of the defendants (pp. 224 and 225\u00a0 of the record).\u00a0 So that there was singular possession, under the title of exclusive owner, on the part of each one of those who made that partition,\u00a0 since October 23, 1895, the date of the public instrument ratifying the partition agreed upon and signed by them on July 8 of the same year.\u00a0\u00a0 From October 23, 1895\u00a0 (and not from March 10, 1895, from which the defendants reckon, the date of the death of Santiago C. Evangelista, when the possession was\u00a0 universal or held in co-ownership),\u00a0 to February 18, 1907, when the complaint was filed, there had elapsed more than the ten years required by law for the prescription of ownership in real properties, as\u00a0 to persons\u00a0 present.\u00a0 The whole\u00a0 question would have rested on the point as to whether this period was really interrupted during three years,\u00a0 as was\u00a0 found in the judgment appealed from; but considerations\u00a0 of another order excuse such a discussion.<\/p><p>The defendants, neither in their written demurrer nor in their answer, made any allegation whatever concerning the prescription, to which they\u00a0 did\u00a0 not refer\u00a0 except in their written argument, presented after the hearing\u00a0 in first instance;\u00a0 and the plaintiffs, replying thereto, said that this question had not\u00a0 been raised during the\u00a0 trial of the case, nor was it contained in the written\u00a0 answer as a special allegation or defense.\u00a0 This has been found to be true.<\/p><p>It is an established doctrine that the defense of prescription, when not alleged in the answer, can not avail in this second instance.\u00a0 (Aldeguer <em>vs<\/em>. Hoskyn, 2 Phil. Rep., 500.)<\/p><p>This\u00a0 court,\u00a0 after\u00a0 stating in the case just above cited, \"but the defense of the statute\u00a0 of limitations, to have been available to the defendant in this case, should have been set up in his answer.\u00a0\u00a0 This was not done,\" added: \"The court, therefore, made no finding thereon.\"\u00a0 The lower court,\u00a0 in the present case,\u00a0 made an express finding in its judgment. It might perhaps be said\u00a0 (the\u00a0 defendants do not say so in their appeal) that the fact of there being a finding in the judgment rendered\u00a0 in first\u00a0 instance,\u00a0 and\u00a0 which can not but be impugned as erroneous, in so far as it\u00a0 constitutes a deprivation of an acquired right, is a sufficient reason for setting up, in second instance, the question of prescription. It might also\u00a0 be\u00a0 alleged\u00a0 (but\u00a0 certainly is not\u00a0 alleged by the defendants)\u00a0 that,\u00a0 as\u00a0 it is requisite that the defense be set forth in the answer and be discussed in first instance, when it is not so set forth it is understood to have been waived, but that, in the present case, the unalleged defense of prescription consisting in a lack of action can not be considered as waived,\u00a0 because the lack of action, as well as that of jurisdiction, may be alleged at any stage\u00a0 of the trial.<\/p><p>However, not for these reasons should this court permit an issue to be set up in second instance, when it was not advanced nor argued in first instance.\u00a0 The\u00a0 lower\u00a0 court, in not sustaining the prescription, considered that the same was interrupted\u00a0 during the time that the courts ceased to be in operation,\u00a0 according to its .assertion, from June, 1898, to July, 1901.\u00a0 This assertion should have been discussed in first instance, both in relation to the facts and to the application of the\u00a0 legal provisions\u00a0 enacted\u00a0 during the Spanish sovereignty until the exchange\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 treaty of peace\u00a0 on April 16,\u00a0 1899, and during the military occupation until the said month of July,\u00a0 1901, when the pres- ent courts began to\u00a0 operate; and such prescription can not be considered by merely taking\u00a0 into account the facts related\u00a0 in the complaint\u00a0 and the date of the same, nor can the defense of prescription be deemed to be comprised in the objection that \"the facts alleged\u00a0 in the\u00a0 complaint\u00a0 do not constitute a right of action\"\u00a0 (Code of Civil Procedure, sec. 93), as has already been held by this court in the case of Domingo <em>vs<\/em>. Osorio (7 Phil. Rep., 405).<\/p><p>The said last assignment of error is, therefore, dismissed. <\/p><p>With respect to the errors alleged, the following premises of law and fact must be taken for granted:\u00a0 first, that Pilar Salunga exercised parental authority over all her five minor children on the date of the partition (Civil Code, art. 154); second, that she had the\u00a0 right to represent them in the prosecution\u00a0 of all their\u00a0 actions, and that she really did represent them in the partition of the estate in question (Id., art. 155).<\/p><p>Could she then, legally represent them?\u00a0 If she could not legally represent them, is the partition of property in which she did represent them, by virtue of her parental authority,\u00a0\u00a0 valid?<\/p><p>These are the questions to be resolved in the present appeal.<\/p><p>The trial court decided them both in the negative.\u00a0 The first,\u00a0 because the\u00a0 mother, Pilar Salunga,\u00a0 had an\u00a0 interest opposed to that of her children, and the latter should have been legally represented in the partition by a next friend judicially appointed, according to the provisions of article 165 of\u00a0 the Civil Code; and as to the second question, because the contract of partition, so executed by one who could not then have the legal representation of\u00a0 the minors, was null, unless it was subsequently ratified by such minors before its revocation by the other participants in the partition, to wit, the other contracting parties, the defendants.<\/p><p>Before\u00a0 deciding\u00a0 these\u00a0 questions\u00a0 in\u00a0 the present appeal, the 4th assignment of error of those hereinbefore enumerated,\u00a0 to wit, that the contract\u00a0 had been validated by the mother who, in the name of\u00a0 her minor children, executed the ratification, must be\u00a0 dismissed\u00a0 as being inopportune, and because it does not come within the provisions of article 1259, applied by the lower court, according to which he who can validate and ratify a contract that is null and void for want of authorization or representation, is \"the person in whose name it was executed,\" that is, the minors themselves who appear as the parties executing the same, rep- resented by their mother.\u00a0 If the partition was null\u00a0 (be it said hypothetically), because the mother could not\u00a0 have therein the legal representation of her minor\u00a0 children, neither could she be vested with the legal representation of these minor children in a subsequent ratificaion of the said partition.\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, what is called a ratification of the partition\u00a0 is nothing more than the public instrument of October 23, 1895, in which the interested parties approved the partition agreed upon and signed on July 8 of the same year, when the children of the deceased Santiago C. Evangelista, who contracted the said partition with the surviv- ing widow,\u00a0 Pilar\u00a0 Salunga,\u00a0 had not yet been declared his intestate heirs.<\/p><p>Having now disposed of the matters of lesser importance of the appeal, the principal question thereof to be decided stands forth more prominently.<\/p><p>If each one of the heirs was already, from October 24, 1895, the exclusive owner of the property which had been awarded to him, and the complaint was unsuccessful in obtaining the annulment of the partition, either on the ground of nullity or on the ground of rescission, by reason of the facts and legal\u00a0 premises herein before explained, could it bring about such annulment through the fact of the mother's having represented her minor children in the contract of partition?<\/p><p>For this act only, must a contract be annulled that was executed in\u00a0 1895 and from which have been derived rights of ownership and singular possession over real and\u00a0 personal property, in behalf respectively of fourteen persons, who, by means of such contract, had reached an agreement to divide the common inheritance and each of them to be the exclusive owner henceforth of his legitimate\u00a0 portion?<\/p><p>In an affirmative case, must proceedings\u00a0 be initiated: for the making of a new inventory and appraisement\u00a0 of\u00a0 the hereditary property,\u00a0 after\u00a0 returning the\u00a0 latter,\u00a0 together with its fruits collected during sixteen years, back into the common undivided mass\u00a0 or funds of the estate; for\u00a0 the appointment of\u00a0 a judicial counsel\u00a0 for three of the minor children of the third\u00a0 marriage who are still under age; to require Pilar Salunga to render an account of the fruits collected from the property of her minor children, which fruits she had a right to take as her own by reason of her parental authority, as will be seen\u00a0 further on,\u00a0 but which, because of the nullity of the partition, she could not so take; for a new partition wherein the eight children of the second marriage, Pilar Salunga, as the surviving widow, Rosario, her daughter, together with the latter's husband, Tomas Olson, Natividad, her other daughter, together with the said Natividad's husband, Gualberto Santos, and a counsel appointed by the court in representation of Pilar Salunga's\u00a0 other children, Jose, Honorio and Virginia, be made parties?<\/p><p>Such would be the unavoidable consequences\u00a0 that would result from an annulment of the contract in question,\u00a0 because of the circumstance, aforestated, of some minor heirs having been represented\u00a0 therein\u00a0 by their mother who in turn took part through her own right by reason\u00a0 of her half of the conjugal property.<\/p><p>The facts to be kept in mind\u00a0 for the determination of\u00a0 the question, are the following:<\/p><p>In a reunion of the family before the family\u00a0 council\u00a0 organized for the guardianship of the three minor\u00a0 children of the second\u00a0 marriage, and which was attended by\u00a0 Pilar Salunga in her\u00a0 own right and as the legal representative of her five minor children of the third marriage, the said family council appointed for the three minors of the second marriage, as\u00a0 guardian, their elder\u00a0 brother, Emiliano; as protutor, a friend of the family; and as expert\u00a0 appraisers, two property owners of the locality in no wise related to\u00a0 the family by blood or marriage.\u00a0 After other resolutions found in the journal of the meetings,\u00a0 kept by the said council, there appears the following\u00a0 one, unanimously adopted\u00a0 by its members:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p><em>\"Resolved<\/em>, That as soon as the inventory\u00a0 and appraisement concerned\u00a0 shall have been made, the guardian (Emiliano), in accord with those of age interested in the estate and with the widow,\u00a0 Dona Maria Pilar\u00a0 Salunga y Dantis, in her own behalf and\u00a0 as the\u00a0 legal representative of her minor children,\u00a0 and with the presence of the other minors over fourteen years of age and the protutor, shall make the division\u00a0 and award,\u00a0 and,\u00a0 in connection wherewith, in a necessary case, he shall request the advice of competent persons and shall pay the necessary expenses, without prejudice to his recording in the property registry the ownership of the property subject to this requisite, as soon as he shall be able to dispose of the sum considered sufficient for this purpose.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The division and award was made by Emiliano C.\u00a0 Evangelista, in the manner directed in the\u00a0 resolution,\u00a0 and\u00a0 a public instrument of the contract of partition was drawn up before a notary.\u00a0 These facts were fully proven at the trial of this case and were admitted by both the litigating parties.<\/p><p>It is this public instrument of the contract of partition that was annulled in the judgment appealed from, because of the defect that the minor children of the third marriage were represented by their own mother, and not by a next friend or special guardian, as\u00a0 required\u00a0 by article 165 of the Civil Code.<\/p><p>The defendants and appellants aver that this article 165 is not in harmony with article 1060 of the same code.<\/p><p>These articles\u00a0 read as follows:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"Art. 1060.\u00a0 If the minors\u00a0 should be subject to the parental authority, and are represented in the division by the father or by the mother, in a proper case, neither judicial intervention nor\u00a0 approval shall be required.\"<\/p><p>\"Art. 165. Whenever, in any matter, the father or mother may have an interest opposed to that of their children, not emancipated, a next friend shall be\u00a0 appointed for the latter, to represent them in court or otherwise.<\/p><p>\"The judge,\u00a0 on petition of\u00a0 the father or of the mother, of the said minor, of the department of public prosecution, or of any\u00a0 other\u00a0 person qualified to appear in court,\u00a0 shall appoint, as the next friend, the relative\u00a0 of the minor to whom the legitimate guardianship\u00a0 should belong in\u00a0 such cases, and, in the absence of the latter, another relative or any person.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>It may\u00a0 incidentally be said that if Pilar Salunga had, in 1895, considered\u00a0 that she had in that partition an interest opposed to that of her children, and had requested, she being the first upon whom it devolved to do so, the appointment of a counsel for them, the court would probably have proceeded in strict accordance with article 211 of the said code, which provides as follows:<\/p><blockquote><p><em>\"Legitimate<\/em> guardianship of\u00a0 minors,\u00a0 not emancipated, pertains solely - <\/p><p>\"1. To the paternal grandfather.<\/p><p>\"2, To the maternal grandfather.<\/p><p>\"3. To the\u00a0 paternal and maternal grandmothers,\u00a0 in the same order, while they remain widows.<\/p><p>\"4. To the eldest of the male brothers of full blood, and, in the absence of the latter, to the eldest of the brothers on the paternal or maternal side.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>and then, in consideration of the facts in evidence in this case, the <em>legitimate<\/em> guardianship of the minor children of Pilar Salunga, in the absence of the persons of the first four degrees\u00a0 of\u00a0 relationship as\u00a0 designated by law,\u00a0 would have devolved upon \"the eldest of the brothers on the paternal or maternal side,\" who\u00a0 is Emiliano\u00a0 C.\u00a0 Evangelista. But, in regard to this point, there is no controversy, nor reason for any, at the present time.<\/p><p>In the opinion of the defendants and appellants, the next friend or counsel required by article 165\u00a0 of the Civil Code virtually substituted\u00a0 the guardian ad\u00a0 Utem of the former <em> Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil<\/em> or law of civil procedure, and which this law required \"when the mother and her minor children were\u00a0 determined to maintain a suit; any other construction of article 165 would show article 1060 to be superfluous, or, at least, that both articles were in conflict.\"<\/p><p>Pilar Salunga,\u00a0 moreover, had waived such rights\u00a0 as might pertain to her in usufruct and, according to a ruling of the <em>Direccion\u00a0 de los Registros<\/em>, of\u00a0 the 9th of\u00a0 October, 1901, the wife who renounces all the rights she may have in her husband's estate,\u00a0 may legally represent her minor children in the partition.\u00a0\u00a0 (Brief, p. 9.)<\/p><p>Had such intervention been\u00a0 demanded\u00a0 at that\u00a0 time, he who demanded it would not have saved himself from paying the costs, on account of the uselessness and needlessness of this\u00a0 proceeding, which did\u00a0 not tend to safeguard the interests of minors, except i$ be when the mother or the guardian had debts to pay to their minors or some suit to maintain against them, or\u00a0 the latter against the former, the minors in all other cases being duly represented, some by the family council and others by the mother who exercised parental authority over her unemancipated children.\" (Brief, pp. 15 and 16.)<\/p><p>This opinion is entirely incorrect and unacceptable.<\/p><p>In the first place,\u00a0 article 165 of the Civil Code did not substitute the provisions of articles 1040 and 1836 of the <em> Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil de\u00a0 Filipinas<\/em>, inasmuch\u00a0 as these\u00a0 two articles,\u00a0 in the case of incompatibility of\u00a0 interests between\u00a0 the\u00a0 father, mother,\u00a0 or guardian and the minor child or\u00a0 incapacitated person, required\u00a0 the representation of a special <em>curator<\/em> or guardian, but only for <em>the trial or in court,<\/em> while article 165 of the Civil Code required <em>it in court and out of it;<\/em> so that, not only in the case of the payment of a debt or of a suit between the father or mother and the minor child must the counsel appointed by the court, the next friend, substitute the said persons in their legal representation,\u00a0\u00a0 but\u00a0 \"always\u00a0 in any matter\u00a0 when\u00a0 such parents have an\u00a0 interest opposed to that of their children,\" and thus, in the absence of the father or the mother who might exercise the parental authority,\u00a0 \"the protutor shall enforce the rights of the minor <em>in and out of court <\/em>whenever they are opposed to the interests of the guardian.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Civil Code, art. 236, No. 2,)<\/p><p>In the second place, article 1060 of the Civil Code means no more than what its text says, to\u00a0 wit, that judicial approval is not necessary in the division of an estate where minors, subject to the parental authority of the father\u00a0 or the mother, are interested, when\u00a0 they are\u00a0 represented therein by either of their parents exercising such authority over them; and it does not mean that they must always\u00a0 be represented solely by their father or mother,\u00a0 by right\u00a0 of his or her parental authority.\u00a0 If the minors are interested in an\u00a0 estate left\u00a0 to them by one not related to them or by a relative and in which the father or the mother, under whose parental authority they are, have no share whatever, it is well indeed that no one other than such father or mother should represent them in the partition of the estate; and, in this case, the circumstance of their being minors does not make\u00a0 the\u00a0 intervention or the approval\u00a0 of\u00a0 the court necessary on account of the fact that they are represented by\u00a0 their father or mother, as,\u00a0 by general rule, would be required without the assistance of a\u00a0 father\u00a0 or\u00a0 a mother holding parental authority over them.\u00a0\u00a0 The general rule is laid down in article 1032 of the <em>Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil de Filipinas,<\/em> which reads as follows:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"The liquidations and partitions of inheritances made extrajudicially, though\u00a0 by receivers appointed by the\u00a0 testator, must be presented\u00a0 for judicial\u00a0 approval\u00a0 whenever any <em>minor,<\/em> incapacitated person, etc., has an interest therein as an heir or legatee of an aliquot part.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>But if the father or the mother who exercises the parental authority is also a party interested in the partition, and his or her interest be opposed\u00a0 to that of their children, neither of the two can represent them in the partition,\u00a0 because contrary designs and tendencies would attach to contrary interests and would be hard to harmonize in the mind of a single person.\u00a0\u00a0 The mother has died leaving minor children whose father\u00a0 survives.\u00a0 The minor\u00a0 children are parties to the partition of the estate left at the mother's death, by reason of\u00a0 their hereditary shares.\u00a0 The\u00a0 father is also a party to the partition of the estate, by right of his half of the conjugal property and\u00a0 his usufructuary share pertaining to him as\u00a0 widower.\u00a0 The father\u00a0 can not be the\u00a0 sole person who in his own behalf and before himself, in his own right as the surviving\u00a0 widower and in representation of his minor children by reason of his parental authority, may make, without the intervention of the court or of any other person,\u00a0 the partition of the estate, inventorying and\u00a0 appraising\u00a0 the property at will, distributing and\u00a0 awarding it\u00a0 at\u00a0 his own pleasure and\u00a0 disposing of the existing co-ownership\u00a0 as\u00a0 best\u00a0 pleases him so that\u00a0 they each\u00a0 may continue thenceforth to be the exclusive owners of their respective parts of\u00a0 the divided property, he of the portion that he wished to take for himself, and the minors, of the shares that their father saw fit to assign to them.\u00a0 The worst of it would be that, if the father and the minor children\u00a0 were the sole heirs and the former were opposed to a division, the actual result would be that the children would remain subject to his will and there would be no one who, in their\u00a0 behalf,\u00a0 could\u00a0 oppose it according to\u00a0 the theory above set out, which is in all respects inadmissible.<\/p><p>The doctrine\u00a0 summed\u00a0 up\u00a0 by Manresa in the following terms is an incontrovertible one, precisely for the proper understanding and application of article 1060 of the Civil Code:<\/p><blockquote>\"Whenever the father or the\u00a0 mother have a contrary interest in the estate, the minors must have a defending counsel appointed, in\u00a0 accordance with article 165, and the partition in which they are interested requires judicial approval (resolutions of the\u00a0 Direction of December 18,\u00a0 1893, and November 24,1898).\"\u00a0\u00a0 (7 Commentaries on the Civil Code, p. 617.)<\/blockquote><p><\/p><p>In\u00a0 the\u00a0 third place,\u00a0 it is not sufficient that the mother waive, as in fact Pilar Salunga did waive, according to page 73 of Exhibit A, her\u00a0 quota of the\u00a0 usufruct pertaining to her as widow, for the\u00a0 purpose\u00a0 of establishing that all interest in this partition, opposed to that of her minor children, has\u00a0 disappeared.\u00a0 She\u00a0 did not likewise waive her right to her half of the conjugal\u00a0 property,\u00a0 which is the strongest interest that she had in the partition, and this is the point that must be examined closely in order to judge correctly\u00a0 whether such interest is\u00a0 opposed to that of her minor children.\u00a0\u00a0 In\u00a0 regard to this phase of the question we find nothing that accords with reason in the appellants' brief.<\/p><p>Though the minor children and the father or the mother who exercises parental authority over them, are interested in the partition,\u00a0 either of the parents may very well represent their minor children and take part in\u00a0 the partition on account of their own interest therein,\u00a0 for the reason that article 165, now\u00a0 under discussion, was\u00a0 not then applicable.\u00a0\u00a0 An example would\u00a0 be no doctrine, however, is established a\u00a0 case where the interest of the minors, or, vice-versa, of the father or of the mother, consisted in\u00a0 a specific legacy; it is evident that here there would be no opposition of interests,, because the father or the mother would lack the freedom of choice and authoritative determination to award such a legacy, and no risk would be run of partiality and injustice.\u00a0 There would be the same absence of opposition if, in the operations relative to an estate, no definitive partitions were made, but aliquot parts of the property were\u00a0 awarded to one and to the\u00a0 other.\u00a0 It is\u00a0 a matter, therefore, in the application of article 165,\u00a0 as to whether there is opposition of interests between the mother and her minor\u00a0 children.<\/p><p>In\u00a0 order to judge of this feature of the case, we must consider the following facts\u00a0 of\u00a0 the partition herein concerned:<\/p><p>It is not alone Pilar\u00a0 Salunga\u00a0 and her minor children who are interested therein, but likewise eight children of the second marriage of Santiago C. Evangelista, and these latter should have for themselves exclusively one-half of the conjugal property of\u00a0 the\u00a0 second marriage, that which pertained to their deceased\u00a0 mother, Antonia Alonso, the other half of the conjugal property being that which they share with their brothers and sisters of the third marriage, just as they equally share with the latter the half of the community property of the last conjugal partnership.<\/p><p>He who effected all the operations of division, under competent professional direction, was Emiliano C. Evangelista. In the partition,\u00a0 one schedule of allotments was not made for Pilar Salunga and another for her minor children, but one alone was made in this form:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"They are to have: the widow, Dona Maria\u00a0 Pilar Salunga y Dantis, as her half of the conjugal property, twenty-three thousand one hundred and seventeen\u00a0 pesos; and her aforementioned minor children,\u00a0 in equal shares, as their legitimate parental portion, sixteen thousand five hundred and ninety-one\u00a0 pesos and fifteen centavos: equal to the total sum of thirty-nine thousand seven hundred and eight pesos and fifteen centavos. - Award. - The said widow and her children are awarded as aforesaid, proportionally, in payment of their respective credits;\u00a0 1 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 (here follow six items\u00a0 of brief descriptions of property, the last one, No. 6,\u00a0 comprising various rural estates, valued at 29,876 pesos).\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Pilar Salunga's interest does not appear to be opposed to, but\u00a0 united with that of her minor children.\u00a0 The joint interest of mother and children is seen in the partition and throughout this entire suit, to be always in various ways and in\u00a0 a parallel manner opposed to that of the eight children of the second marriage, and this is all the opposition that can be shown, an opposition between the property of the one and the other marriage; the children of the second marriage form a group with certain property for the sum of P41,539, and those of the third marriage, jointly\u00a0 with their mother, form another\u00a0 group with certain\u00a0 property aggregating a total value of P46,234.\u00a0 Pilar Salunga neither made nor could have any influence in making her credit or assets of better condition than that of her children, nor could she perform any\u00a0 act whatever that might prejudice her minor children.\u00a0 In reality, between Pilar Salunga and her children, there was no definite partition, but a joint award \"proportionately, in payment of their respective credits\" of some of the property of the estate, which, after the partition had been made, they continued to hold in co-ownership between themselves\u00a0 in the form of community property, though\u00a0 no\u00a0 longer in co-ownership with the children of the second marriage, by reason of the estate <em>pro indiviso.<\/em>\u00a0 Pilar Salunga's interest necessarily will appear to be opposed\u00a0 to that of\u00a0 her children the day when they proceed to dissolve their co-ownership or community property.\u00a0 So that, in\u00a0 conclusion,\u00a0 it must be said that, in the division already made of the estate, the interest of Pilar Salunga was not opposed to that\u00a0 of her children, inasmuch as all\u00a0 that was then endeavored to be done was to separate the property of one marriage from that of another; but in the division that some day may be made\u00a0 of the community property, that of the last marriage still now held <em>pro indiviso<\/em>, between the mother and the children of this last marriage, necessarily\u00a0 the mother's interest will be opposed to that of her children, and then it will\u00a0 be that the latter can not be\u00a0 represented by Pilar Salunga, but by counsel appointed by\u00a0 the court,\u00a0 in accordance with\u00a0 the provisions\u00a0 of article\u00a0 165,\u00a0 here concerned.\u00a0 The reason for the joint ownership agreed upon is probably the right of legal usufruct which the mother has in the property of her minor children, through her parental authority.\u00a0\u00a0 (Civil Code, art. 160.)<\/p><p>A case decided\u00a0 by the <em>Direccion General de los Registros,<\/em> is quite analogous to the present one:\u00a0 The mother had died, leaving seven children, two of them minors.\u00a0 She\u00a0 had bequeathed to her husband, besides the rights pertaining\u00a0 to him as widower,\u00a0 one-third of\u00a0 her property, the other two-thirds\u00a0 being\u00a0 the\u00a0 inheritance of the seven children.\u00a0\u00a0 Some disagreements arose and\u00a0 they were submitted to friendly arbitrators, in accordance with the proper\u00a0 agreement to that effect, one of the parties to which was\u00a0 the widower in his own behalf and as the legal representative of the two minor children.\u00a0 The arbitrators rendered their award of partition by\u00a0 notarial instrument.\u00a0\u00a0 This instrument\u00a0 was presented to the property registry, on account of certain real property being concerned in the partition, but the\u00a0 registrar\u00a0 refused to admit it \"because the provision of article 165 of the Civil Code, relative to the appointment of a counsel for the minors who may have interests opposed to those of their parents, had not been complied with.\"\u00a0\u00a0 But an appeal having been taken to the\u00a0 said <em>Direccion General<\/em>, the registrar's ruling was reversed, on the following ground, among others:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"The arbitrators\u00a0 having effected the\u00a0 partition of the estate of the Marchioness of Bedmar (the\u00a0 mother), without the intervention of the said minors nor that of their father, there is no act nor contract of record where for, on account of opposition of interests between the parties, it may have been necessary to appoint a counsel for the children, in accordance with the provisions of article\u00a0 165\u00a0 of the Civil Code.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Moreover, the complaint in the case at bar contains a peculiarity.\u00a0 It is understood\u00a0 why Pilar Salunga should demand the rescission of the contract, if she had suffered damage, and its nullity, if there\u00a0 was an introduction of persona as heirs who were not such; but it is not understood how, being herself the cause of this nullity now in\u00a0 question, instead of being the party sued by her own children, she could properly be the plaintiff who alleges as a cause of action her own fault and brings suit against all the other persons interested, with the intention\u00a0 of dissolving the contract, not because of any responsibility incurred by the other contracting party, but because of her own fault.<\/p><p>The\u00a0 supreme court of\u00a0 Spain decided a case that is also analogous: A mother had herself made a partition, as the mother and the legal representative of her minor daughter, the sole heir of her father who was the predecessor-in-interest of the estate.\u00a0 The\u00a0 partition proceedings were set out in a public instrument executed by her, in\u00a0 the capacity mentioned, and\u00a0 by a creditor for a large sum of money who accepted the\u00a0 acknowledgment\u00a0 of his credit given in that document by the mother.\u00a0 At\u00a0 the same time, on\u00a0 the same date and by the same parties,\u00a0 another instrument was executed\u00a0 in which record was\u00a0 inserted of a partial payment made on account of the debt and of the terms stipulated for\u00a0 the successive\u00a0 payments.\u00a0 Later, the mother brought suit for the\u00a0 nullification\u00a0 of the two public\u00a0 instruments that she had\u00a0 executed, alleging a vice of origin in them both - a lack of judicial approval for the first, and a lack of judicial permission for the second.\u00a0 Her suit having been decided adverse to her in two\u00a0 instances, she raised an appeal in cassation, alleging, as the first assignment of error, that although article 1060 of\u00a0 the Civil Code\u00a0 does\u00a0 not require judicial approval of the partitions wherein a minor has an interest, when represented in the same by the father, or, in a proper case, by the mother, this article\u00a0 had \"no application to the\u00a0 case at bar, in\u00a0 accordance with the transitory provisions of the code, inasmuch as it was a question of\u00a0 rights that had been derived\u00a0 from, and\u00a0 of\u00a0 acts that had been performed under the previous legislation; but that, although this were not so, \"most likely there was a violation of article 165 of the same code, which requires the appointment of a counsel for\u00a0 the\u00a0 minors when their interest\u00a0 is opposed to that of their parents\/'\u00a0 And the supreme court, adopting opinions contained in the judgment of the trial court, held:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"That the mother and representative of the heiress took part, exercising full capacity and her free will, in the execution of the two instruments, there\u00a0 being no conflict between the rights\u00a0 and interests of the mother and of the daughter; that it\u00a0 was a legal doctrine that contracts could not be set aside by the\u00a0 will of but one of the contracting parties,\u00a0 and that\u00a0 no one may go counter to his own acts; that on the hypothesis that the said instruments did contain some defect, the same would be ascribable to the mother herself, who is the person who <em>ought to have<\/em> seen that they were executed in conformity with all the required formalities; and that there existed no legal provision\u00a0 whereby, on account of the failure\u00a0 to apply for judicial approval of the transactions\u00a0 effected,\u00a0 an annulment might be obtained of the settlement and partition\u00a0 of the estate wherein a minor is interested.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>For the foregoing reasons,\u00a0 the judgment appealed from is affirmed, in so far\u00a0 as it disallows the petition for annulment based on\u00a0 the first four grounds of\u00a0 the\u00a0 appeal, and is reversed, in so far as it holds\u00a0 the partition made, shown in Exhibit A, to be null and void and orders that proceedings be instituted for the making of a new partition and for the carrying out of the rest of the judgment,\u00a0 for, the reason that the\u00a0 said plaintiff, Pilar Salunga, lacked the\u00a0 capacity to represent\u00a0 her minor\u00a0 children\u00a0 in the partition herein concerned.<\/p><p>No special finding\u00a0 is\u00a0 made as regards\u00a0 the costs.\u00a0 So ordered.<\/p><p><em> Mapa, Johnson, Carson,<\/em> and <em>Moreland, JJ.<\/em>, concur.<\/p><\/div>",

ALDECOA AND COMPANY, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/>\n<br\/>\nD E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">On\u00a0 April\u00a0 20, li)07, the Attorney-General filed a written complaint in the Court of First Instance of Surigao against the Arm\u00a0 of\u00a0 Aldecoa &amp;\u00a0 Co., t alleging\u00a0 that\u00a0 the defendant, a mercantile co-partnership company organized under the laws in force in these Islands and domiciled in this city of Manila with a branch office in Surigao, continues to operate as such mercantile copartnership company\u00a0 under\u00a0 the name of Aldecoa\u00a0 &amp; Co.; that the said\u00a0 defendant, knowing that it had tio title or right whatever to two adjoining parcels of land, which belong to the domain\u00a0 of the Government of the United States and were placed under the administration and control of the Government of\u00a0 these Islands,\u00a0 has been\u00a0 occupying them illegally for the past seventeen years, more or less, having constructed on the land a wharf,\u00a0 located along the railroad, and\u00a0 built warehouses\u00a0 of light\u00a0 material for\u00a0 the storage of coal - all for its exclusive use\u00a0 and benefit; that of the said two parcels of land, the parcel B has an area of 11 centares, approximately, and the parcel A, 84 centares, more or less, and their situation, metes and bounds, together with other details thereunto pertaining, are\u00a0 set out in the judgment of the court; that these lands, situated in Bilangbilang, in the pueblo of Surigao and the province\u00a0 of the same name,\u00a0 belonged to the late Spanish Government in the Philippines and are now the property of the Government of the United States and were placed under the control of the Insular Government, which, by virtue of\u00a0 the treaty of Paris, has succeeded the former in all its rights; that, since the year 1901, the defendant has been requested repeatedly by the Attorney-General, in representation of the Insular Government, to recognize the latter's right of\u00a0 dominion over the same and to deliver to it the said\u00a0 property, and that, by reason of such demands, Aldecoa &amp; Co., on February 25, 1903, recognizing\u00a0 the\u00a0 Insular\u00a0 Government's\u00a0 ownership, agreed to return the land, but that later,\u00a0 after\u00a0 several delays, it concluded by persisting in its attempt illegally to continue occupying the said land\u00a0 and refused to return it\u00a0 to the Insular Government; wherefore the Attorney-General asked the court to enter judgment declaring the Insular Government to be the owner of the land claimed, and to order that the plaintiff be\u00a0 placed in possession of the same, together with the fruits collected by the defendant since it took such possession, and those awaiting collection, and to sentence the defendant to pay the costs.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the defendant, Aldecoa &amp; Co.,\u00a0 in\u00a0 liquidation, answering the preceding complaint, set forth that it denied each and all of the allegations of the\u00a0 complaint, with the exception of those which it expressly admitted in its answer; and that it admitted paragraph 2 of the complaint, that is, the fact of the defendant's being a mercantile copartnership company,' organized under the laws in force in these Islands. As a special defense, it alleged that it held and possessed, as owner, and had full and absolute dominion over, the lands claimed by the plaintiff in paragraph 1 of the complaint. The defendant therefore prayed that judgment be rendered in its favor, by absolving it from the complaint, with the costs\u00a0 against the plaintiff, together with the other relief solicited.<br\/><br\/>The provincial\u00a0 fiscal\u00a0 of Surigao\u00a0 presented a motion on November 3, 1908, for the purpose of amending the preceding complaint, with the permission of the court, by inserting, between paragraphs 4 and 5 of the complaint, a separate paragraph, as follows:\u00a0 \"That Aldecoa and Company's possession of the lands here in question, was in fact interrupted during the years 1900, 1901, and 1902;\" but, in view of the ruling of the court by an order\u00a0 of\u00a0 November 5, 1908, directing the plaintiff, within three days to specify the facts that constituted the alleged interruption of the defendant's possession of the\u00a0 lands in\u00a0 question, the provincial fiscal presented, on the 6th of the same month, a new written motion whereby he\u00a0 requested permission to amend the previous\u00a0 complaint by inserting between the said paragraphs 4 and 5\u00a0 of the original complaint, a separate, paragraph, as follows.\u00a0 \"That the municipality of Surigao, in the\u00a0 year 1900,\u00a0 and through the mediation of Captain Kendrick, removed the posts and wire which\u00a0 enclosed the property here in question, the sole sign of possession'that the\u00a0 defendant then\u00a0 had to\u00a0 the\u00a0 said lands.\"\u00a0\u00a0 Inasmuch as no objection whatever was raised to the amendment requested, the court granted the same\u00a0 by an\u00a0 order of December 7, 1908.<br\/><br\/>The case came up for hearing\u00a0 on the 1st of December of that year and, after the presentation of testimony by\u00a0 both parties, the documents exhibited being attached to the record, the court, on December 10, 1909, rendered judgment and found that the land in question\u00a0 was public land and belonged to the State, and ordered the defendant to return it to the plaintiff\u00a0 and to pay the costs, with the proviso that the plaintiff\u00a0 might have the crops and the buildings on the land, upon the payment\u00a0 of\u00a0 an indemnity\u00a0 therefor, or might compel the defendant to pay him the value of the land, as provided by article 361 of the Civil Code.\u00a0 Counsel for the defendant\u00a0 excepted\u00a0 to\u00a0 this\u00a0 judgment, and\u00a0 by a written motion of the 4th of January asked for a rehearing of the case on\u00a0 the grounds that the said judgment was unwarranted by the evidence\u00a0 and\u00a0 was\u00a0 contrary to\u00a0 law. This motion was disallowed, exception thereto was taken by the appellant and, the required bill of exceptions being filed, in which was\u00a0 set out, at the request of the provincial fiscal, the latter's exception to the order issued by the judge on January 24, while in Cagayan,\u00a0 Province of Misamis, granting an extension of time for the presentation of the bill of exceptions, it was certified and transmitted to the clerk of this court.<br\/><br\/>The demand of the representative of the Government is for the recovery of\u00a0 possession of two united parcels of land, belonging to the public\u00a0 use and domain, which\u00a0 are\u00a0 at present occupied by\u00a0 the defendant Aldecoa &amp; Co.\u00a0 The latter claims to\u00a0 have the\u00a0 full and absolute ownership of the said land and to have held it\u00a0 as owner since 1889, by virtue of a verbal\u00a0 permit from the\u00a0 politico-military\u00a0 governor\u00a0 of Surigao.<br\/><br\/>From the proceedings\u00a0 had and by the testimony of a large number of competent\u00a0 witnesses, one of whom\u00a0 was introduced by the\u00a0 defendant party itself, it\u00a0 was clearly proved that, in 1889, the land in litigation, as well as Bates Avenue, was, during the\u00a0 extraordinary high tides,\u00a0 usually covered by sea water that would extend to the other side of the said avenue, as far as the warehouse of Aldecoa &amp; Co. that was erected there, and, at the ordinary low tides, as far as the wall\u00a0 buijt\u00a0 along the shore\u00a0 by the aforesaid firm and designated by the numbers 5, 6, and 7 in the plan, Exhibit A.\u00a0 This plan, according to the agreement between the parties, exactly\u00a0 represents the land in litigation.<br\/><br\/>It was likewise proved that nearly all the land in question was low land and swampy in\u00a0 certain places, with aquatic bushes growing\u00a0 upon it; that it had been gradually raised by the action of the sea, which in\u00a0 its ebb and flow left sand and other\u00a0 sediment on the low ground; that the retaining wall erected to prevent the sea water from reaching the said warehouse, that is on the opposite side of Bates Avenue,\u00a0 contributed in a large measure toward raising the level of the land; and that, furthermore, between the years 1889 and 1890, there were two piers on the said land, one belonging to the Spanish Government and the other to one named Carloto, alongside\u00a0 of which the vessels\u00a0 used to lie that called at Surigao during their voyages.<br\/><br\/>It is, then, incontrovertible that the land in\u00a0 question is of the public domain and belongs to the State, inasmuch as at the present time it is partly shore land\u00a0 and in part, was such formerly, and now is land formed by\u00a0 the action of the sea.<br\/><br\/>Treating of the sea coasts and shores as property of the public use and domain, partida 3, title 28,\u00a0 law 3, says:<br\/><blockquote>\"The things\u00a0 which belong in common\u00a0 to all\u00a0 the living creatures of this world, are: The air, rain water, the sea and its shores;\u00a0 for every living creature may\u00a0 use them, according to its needs, etc.\"<\/blockquote>Law 4 of the same title and partida says, among other things:<br\/><blockquote>\"And\u00a0 by the\u00a0 seashore\u00a0 is understood all that space of ground covered by\u00a0 the waters of the sea, in their highest annual tides, whether in winter or summer.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The Law of Waters of August 3, 1866, extended to these Islands by\u00a0 the royal decree of the 8th of\u00a0 the same month and year and, together with the decree ordering its enforcement, issued\u00a0 by the Gobierno General on September 21, 1871, was\u00a0 published in\u00a0 the Official Gazette of the 24th of the same month, which law was not substituted nor repealed by that of June 13, 1879, promulgated in Spain and not extended to these Islands, provides, in article 1, that:<br\/><blockquote>\"The following are part of the national domain open to public use:<br\/><center><br\/>*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><\/center> <br\/>\"2.\u00a0 The\u00a0 coast sea, that\u00a0 is, the maritime zone encircling the coasts, to the full\u00a0 width recognized\u00a0 by international law.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 * <br\/><br\/>\"3.\u00a0 The shores.\u00a0 By the shore is\u00a0 understood that space alternately covered and uncovered by the\u00a0 movement of the tide.\u00a0\u00a0 Its interior or terrestrial limit is the line reached by the highest equinoctial tides.\u00a0\u00a0 Where the\u00a0 tides are not appreciable, the\u00a0 shore\u00a0 begins on the\u00a0 land\u00a0 side\u00a0 at\u00a0 the\u00a0 line reached by the sea during ordinary storms or tempests.<br\/><br\/>\"Art. 4.\u00a0 Lands added to the shores by accretions\u00a0 and alluvium\u00a0 deposits caused\u00a0 by the action\u00a0 of the sea; form part of the public domain.\u00a0 When they are no longer washed by the waters of the sea, and are not necessary\u00a0 for the purposes of public utility, or for the establishment of special industries, or for the\u00a0 coast-guard service, the Government shall declare them to be the property of the owners of the estates adjacent thereto and as an increment thereof.<br\/><br\/>\"Art, 5. Lands reclaimed from the sea in consequence of works constructed by the State, or by the provinces, pueblos, or private persons,\u00a0 with proper permission, shall\u00a0 become the property of the party constructing such works, unless otherwise provide, by the terms of the grant of authority.<br\/><br\/>\"Art. 17. The use of the shores also belongs to the public under\u00a0 the police\u00a0 supervision of the\u00a0 civil authorities; all persons may fish thereon,\u00a0 wash, bathe, embark and disembark on pleasure\u00a0 trips, spread and\u00a0 dry\u00a0 clothes and nets, bathe cattle,\u00a0 remove sand, and collect stones, shells, plants, shellfish, and other products of the\u00a0 sea, and do other things of a like nature.\u00a0\u00a0 These rights may be restricted by virtue of the\u00a0 regulations necessary for the coast\u00a0 defense or police supervision, or in the interest of public utility or decency.<br\/><br\/>\"Art. 18. In no place on the coasts, shores, ports, or entrances of rivers,\u00a0 nor\u00a0 on\u00a0 the islands referred to in article 3, shall new works of any kind whatever be constructed, nor any building be erected, without proper permission, in accordance with the provisions of this law and with those of the law regarding ports.\"<\/blockquote>On\u00a0 the supposition\u00a0 that Aldecoa &amp; Co. commenced to occupy the land and shore herein\u00a0 concerned, prior to\u00a0 the enforcement\u00a0 of the Civil\u00a0 Code\u00a0 in\u00a0 these Islands, it is\u00a0 unquestionable that the issue pending decision must be determined in accordance with the provisions of the said Law of Waters of August 3, 1866, inasmuch as the shores, as well as the lands united thereto by the accretions and alluvium deposits produced by the action of the sea, are of the public use and domain.<br\/><br\/>Excluding the space occupied by Bates Avenue, that lies between the defendant's\u00a0 buildings and the shore and the lands added to\u00a0 the\u00a0 latter by the action\u00a0 of the sea in the sitio called Bilangbilang, all this said\u00a0 land, together\u00a0 with the adjacent shore, belongs to the public\u00a0 domain and is intended for public uses.\u00a0 So that the defendant, in constructing on the two aforementioned parcels of land a retaining wall,\u00a0 a pier or\u00a0 wharf, a railway, and\u00a0 warehouses for the storage of\u00a0 coal,\u00a0 for its\u00a0 exclusive use\u00a0 and\u00a0 benefit, did all this without due and competent authority\u00a0 and has\u00a0 been illegally occupying the land since\u00a0 1889,\u00a0 since, as a result of demands made upon it since 1901 by the representative of the Insular\u00a0 Government, Aldecoa &amp; Co., by a letter of February 25, 1903,\u00a0 acknowledged that the\u00a0 land\u00a0 belonged to the Government and consented to vacate it, although it afterwards persisted in its claim that it was\u00a0 the owner of the land and refused to vacate and place it at the disposal of the Insular\u00a0 Government, whose representative, in view of the\u00a0 defendant's\u00a0 changed attitude in\u00a0 the matter,\u00a0 was forced to bring this action to recover its possession.<br\/><br\/>Aldecoa\u00a0 &amp; Co. endeavored to\u00a0 prove\u00a0 that the land,\u00a0 consisting of the two united\u00a0 parcels A and B, belonged to them in fee simple, on account of their having begun to occupy it through a verbal\u00a0 permit\u00a0 from the then politico-military governor of Surigao.\u00a0 Although\u00a0 the\u00a0 record does not show the nature of the permit obtained, yet\u00a0 it is inferred from the document Exhibit C I that the said permit was a verbal authorization to occupy the land\u00a0 on condition that the defendant\u00a0 should\u00a0 later on prepare title\u00a0 deeds\u00a0 thereto,\u00a0 and that this authorization was granted for the purpose of furnishing facilities to,\u00a0 and benefiting the\u00a0 merchants of Surigao, in view of the backward condition\u00a0 of things in those\u00a0 regions at that time.\u00a0 It\u00a0 is certain, however,\u00a0 that Aldecoa &amp; Co. did not obtain or\u00a0 solicit permission from the\u00a0 Government to establish themselves\u00a0 there\u00a0 and erect thereon their buildings and\u00a0 works, nor did they endeavor to obtain any title of ownership to the said land, as one of their witnesses, Juan\u00a0 Y.\u00a0 Aldecoa,\u00a0 testified.\u00a0 Furthermore, in the said letter or document Exhibit C\u00a0 I, the attorney then representing the defendant prayed that in case of sale or total or partial lease thereof Aldecoa &amp; Co.\u00a0 should\u00a0 be given preference to any other party, on\u00a0 account of the important improvements they had made\u00a0 on the land.<br\/><br\/>It is\u00a0 true that, notwithstanding the fact that the lands which become an adjacent part of the shores through the accretions\u00a0 occasioned by the action of the\u00a0 sea,\u00a0 when they are no longer covered by such waters,\u00a0 or are not necessary for the purposes of public utility, for\u00a0 the establishment\u00a0 of special\u00a0 industries, or for the coast-guard\u00a0 service,\u00a0 may\u00a0 be declared by the Government to be the property of the owners of the estates adjacent thereto; but the defendant\u00a0 has not proven\u00a0 that it obtained for\u00a0 itself,\u00a0 in\u00a0 conformity with the provisions\u00a0 of article\u00a0 4 of the said Law of Waters, such declaration of ownership, and competent authorization obtained from\u00a0 the Insular Government is indispensable\u00a0 in order that a private person may construct works on the seashore and thereby secure lands for his profit and benefit, pursuant to article 5\u00a0 of the same law, inasmuch as article 18 strictly prohibits the construction\u00a0 of any works or the erection of any building at\u00a0 any place on\u00a0 the coasts and shores, without proper authorization.<br\/><br\/>Aside from the verbal\u00a0 permission alleged, but not duly proven, and\u00a0 leaving aside the fact that the same is not admissible in official and administrative proceedings, it has in no wise been proved that Aldecoa &amp;\u00a0 Co. obtained from the Insular Government any authorization whatever\u00a0 to erect a\u00a0 retaining wall, to construct a pier and warehouses, and to lay a railway on the land in question, which belonged to the State\u00a0 and was destined\u00a0 to\u00a0 public uses, as\u00a0 the defendant must have very well known;\u00a0 nor\u00a0 could\u00a0 any right whatever be created in its favor, and to the prejudice of the State, by its having filled in, without the proper permission, the aforementioned land for the purpose of raising the level thereof.<br\/><br\/>The Civil Code, which went into effect in these Islands on December\u00a0 7, 1889, the twentieth day of its\u00a0 publication in the<i> Gaceta de\u00a0 Manila<\/i> of the\u00a0 17th of November of the same year, confirms the\u00a0 provisions of the said Law\u00a0 of Waters, since, in its article 339, it prescribes that:<br\/><blockquote>\"Property of public ownership is - <br\/><br\/>\"1. That destined to the public use, such as roads, canals, rivers, torrents, ports, and bridges constructed by the State, and banks, shores, roadsteads, and that of a similar character.\"<\/blockquote>Article 341 of the same code provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"Property of public ownership, when no longer devoted to general\u00a0 uses or to the requirements of the defense of the territory, shall become a part of the State property.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The shores\u00a0 and the lands reclaimed from the sea, while they continue to be devoted\u00a0 to public uses arid no grant whatever has been made of any portion of them to private persons,\u00a0 remain a\u00a0 part of the public domain and are for public uses, and,\u00a0 until they are converted\u00a0 into patrimonial property of the State, such lands, thrown up by the action of the sea,\u00a0 and the shores adjacent thereto, are, not susceptible of prescription, inasmuch as, being dedicated to the public uses, they are not subject\u00a0 of commerce among men, in accordance with the provision of article 1936 of the Civil Code.<br\/><br\/>The occupation or material possession of any land formed upon\u00a0 the shore by accretions and alluvium deposits occasioned by the\u00a0 sea, where\u00a0 the occupant or possessor\u00a0 is a private person and holds\u00a0 without previous permission or authorization from the\u00a0 Government, granted in due form, although he may have had the intention to hold it for the purpose of making it his own, is illegal possession on his part and amounts to nothing more than a mere detainer of the land, which is out of the sphere of the commerce of men, as\u00a0 belonging to\u00a0 the public\u00a0 domain and being allotted to public uses and for the use of all persons who live at the place where it is situated.<br\/><br\/>The record does\u00a0 not disclose that Aldecoa\u00a0 &amp; Co. had obtained from the Spanish Government of the Philippines the requisite authorization legally to\u00a0 occupy the said two parcels of land of which they now claim to be the owners; wherefore, the occupation or possession which they allege they hold is a mere detainer that can merit from the law no protection\u00a0 such as is afforded\u00a0 only to the person legally in possession.<br\/><br\/>The politico-military governor of Surigao\u00a0 having\u00a0 had no authority or\u00a0 power to grant the possession or ownership of the said two parcels of land, could not have authorized their occupancy under\u00a0 a title of ownership.\u00a0\u00a0 At the most, he may have, as alleged,\u00a0 verbally authorized the defendant to construct a pier, to fill in with earth the passageway necessary to enable the same\u00a0 to be\u00a0 reached from Bates Avenue, to erect a retaining\u00a0 wall to prevent the sea water, which used to inundate the\u00a0 said avenue, from flowing\u00a0 inward\u00a0 as far as the defendant's warehouses, and to build\u00a0 warehouses on the high land, raised\u00a0 by the action of the water near the shore; but such\u00a0 verbal authorization,\u00a0 even admitting that it was actually given, and the\u00a0 material occupation enjoyed by\u00a0 the defendant during\u00a0 more\u00a0 than\u00a0 ten\u00a0 years, have not created rights such\u00a0 as could legitimize a detention to the prejudice of\u00a0 the\u00a0 public, and\u00a0 of the State which represents the community, the sole entity entitled\u00a0 to the\u00a0 use and enjoyment of the\u00a0 land and\u00a0 shore usurped, for the very\u00a0 reason that such shores\u00a0 and lands belong to the national domain, are intended\u00a0 for\u00a0 public uses and\u00a0 are not susceptible of prescription, as they do not pertain to the commerce of men.<br\/><br\/>The subject of this suit, as has been seen, is a tract of land that is a continuation of the shore at\u00a0 the <i>sitio<\/i> of Bilangbilang and was formed on that shore\u00a0 by alluvium deposits occasioned\u00a0 by the action of the waters of the sea, that is, was land reclaimed\u00a0 from the sea, as fully proven by\u00a0 the record in this case; therefore the present issue is identical with that decided in the case of Ker &amp; Co. <i>vs.<\/i> Cauden\u00a0 (6 Phil. Rep., 732) relative to a tract of land formed by\u00a0 the action\u00a0 of the sea and which has become a part of the so-called Sangley Point, in the Province of Cavite, and conser quently the findings and doctrine established in that decision are properly applicable\u00a0 to this action, as may be\u00a0 seen by a perusal of that case.<br\/><br\/>The land in question, together with the shore of which it forms\u00a0 a part, is not, considering its conditions, comprised within the provisions of section 54 of Act No. 926, for\u00a0 the reason that it can not be deemed to be agricultural public lands, nor mangrove-swamp land, inasmuch as it is unquestionable,\u00a0 as the record shows it to have been proven, that the disputed property is land which was reclaimed from the sea through accretions produced by the action of\u00a0 the water upon a high part of the shore, and\u00a0 is, therefore, land intended for public uses.\u00a0 This classification loses none of its force from the fact that a part of the land is swampy,\u00a0 because this circumstance does not divest it of its true character as land gained\u00a0 from the sea by accretion.<br\/><br\/>Mangrove-swamp land, which is generally situated inland at a certain distance from the seashore,\u00a0 although it is usually inundated\u00a0 by the waters of the sea, especially at high tide, can not be confounded with the land formed by the action of the sea and which forms the shore line thereof; and for this reason,\u00a0 the decisions rendered in the cases of Montano <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>. Insular\u00a0 Government\u00a0 (12 Phil. Rep., 572), and Mapa<i> vs<\/i>. Insular Government (10 Phil. Rep., 175), wherein due consideration was given to the provisions of section 54 of Act No. 926, have no application to\u00a0 the\u00a0 present action, which solely concerns land formed by the action of the sea, and the shore that is a\u00a0 part of it, both intended for public uses, while the references made by the appellant party apply to building lots, fisheries and nipa lands that were inundated by sea water and which, though covered with a\u00a0 good deal of water, could not\u00a0 be said to be navigable ways.\u00a0 The land in question, on the contrary, together with its adjacent shore, borders on\u00a0 water of great depth, the Pacific Ocean, for, besides the pier constructed at the place by the defendant and appellant, there were two others, and all intended for the service of the steamships that plied the high seas and were accustomed to enter the said port and there anchor alongside of these piers.<br\/><br\/>Under no consideration could the land herein concerned, together with the\u00a0 shore upon which it is formed, be classed as agricultural land\u00a0 susceptible of appropriation,\u00a0 and as such form the basis for the\u00a0 allegation of the possession of an imperfect or prescriptive title thereto, because, as aforestated, so long as the land in litigation belongs to the national domain and is reserved for public uses, it is not capable of being appropriated by any private person, except through express authorization granted in due form\u00a0 by a competent authority - a requisite which the defendant and appellant was\u00a0 unable to prove for the\u00a0 purpose\u00a0 of legalizing his possession.<br\/><br\/>However, on the supposition that the defendant, Aldecoa &amp; Co., began to occupy the said land and shore after first obtaining verbal permission from a politico-military governor, constructing thereon a pier, warehouse, and retaining wall, it is right to hold, as did the lower court in his judgment, that it acted in good faith, and, under such a supposition, the provisions of article 361 of the Civil Code must be complied with.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, in the course\u00a0 of the explanation\u00a0 of which the errors attributed to the judgment appealed from have been disposed of, it\u00a0 is our opinion\u00a0 that such judgment should\u00a0 be fully affirmed, as it\u00a0 is in accordance with the law.\u00a0 The costs shall be assessed against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i> Mapa<\/i> and <i>Johnson, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><br\/><i>Moreland<\/i> and <i>Carson, JJ.<\/i>, concur in the result.\u00a0 <\/div>",

TOMAS BERNARDO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/>\n<br\/>\nD E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">In November, 1907, Tomas Bernardo entered into amorous relations with Isadora Mesina, a minor\u00a0 18 years of age, and on this account\u00a0 the said Tomas\u00a0 Bernardo\u00a0 frequented the house in which the girl lived; he succeeded in lying with her on the afternoon of March 1, 1909,\u00a0 through promise\u00a0 of marriage, while her father, Saturnino, and\u00a0 her sister, Juliana Mesina, were absent from the house and her mother was in another room attending\u00a0 her sick daughter.\u00a0 As a result of the said relations and of the coition\u00a0 that took place on the afternoon aforesaid, the girl became pregnant and later gave birth to a\u00a0 female child, one month and a half before the hearing in\u00a0 the present case.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, the father of the seduced girl filed a complaint in the justice of the peace\u00a0 court of Mariquina and, as a result of the trial, the accused was sentenced to four months of <i>arresto mayor <\/i>and to the accessory penalties.\u00a0 An\u00a0 appeal was taken to, the Court\u00a0 of\u00a0 First Instance, and the provincial fiscal, in view of the proceedings before the justice of the peace, filed a complaint, on June 17, 1909, charging Tomas Bernardo with the crime of<i> estupro<\/i>.\u00a0 The defendant excepted on the ground of\u00a0 lack of jurisdiction, the\u00a0 court\u00a0 overruled\u00a0 the demurrer and\u00a0 declared\u00a0 that\u00a0 it was competent in the matter at issue.\u00a0 The\u00a0 case thereupon came up for trial and, upon the evidence adduced therein, judgment\u00a0 was\u00a0 rendered on\u00a0 March 18, 1910, sentencing the accused to the penalty of four months of <i>arresto mayor,<\/i> to\u00a0 pay an indemnity of P400 to\u00a0 the\u00a0 offended party, to recognize\u00a0 as\u00a0 his\u00a0 daughter the female\u00a0 child\u00a0 born to the said Isidora Mesina,\u00a0 to pay to the latter P10\u00a0 a month for the support of the child, and the costs.\u00a0 From this judgment the defendant appealed.<br\/><br\/>While it is true that the crime of simple, unqualified, seduction is punishable under article 443\u00a0 of the Penal Code with the penalty of <i>arresto mayor,<\/i> it is no less true that article 449 of the same code provides that - <br\/><blockquote>\"Those guilty of rape, seduction, or\u00a0 abduction\u00a0 shall be condemned also, by way of indemnification: (1) To endow the injured woman, if she were unmarried or a widow; (2) to acknowledge\u00a0 the offspring, if the character\u00a0 of its origin should not prevent it; (3) in all cases,\u00a0 to support the offspring.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>These declarations, necessarily required by\u00a0 statute, are not really,\u00a0 in a strict legal sense, accessories of the personal penalty imposed by the Penal Code upon the seducer, but are rather those which the penal law prescribes shall be made by the judge in passing final sentence in\u00a0 the cause, in order that it may be shown\u00a0 that, besides the personal\u00a0 penalty, the accused, in consequence of his crime, has incurred the obligations expressly stated\u00a0 by the said code.<br\/><br\/>These\u00a0 obligations\u00a0 imposed\u00a0 upon\u00a0 the\u00a0 culprit ordinarily exceed the\u00a0 amount of the penalty fixed by the law as being within the\u00a0 jurisdiction of the justice of the peace court and comprise,\u00a0 moreover,\u00a0 by\u00a0 virtue\u00a0 of\u00a0 the forced\u00a0 recognition imposed by article 135 of the Civil Code, the special determination of the civil status of the offspring\u00a0 which resulted from the crime, consequently, although\u00a0 the said crime of seduction is only punished by the penalty of <i>arresto mayor,<\/i> a judgment of conviction can not be pronounced\u00a0 by a justice of the peace, on account of his lack\u00a0 of jurisdiction.<br\/><br\/>But disregarding the amount of the indemnity, whatever it be, according\u00a0 to the\u00a0 conditions\u00a0 and circumstances of the\u00a0 offended party and of the one obliged to furnish the same, which amount might be greater than that fixed by law as within\u00a0 the jurisdiction of justice of the peace courts, the acknowledgment of the resulting offspring, one of the findings which the sentence must contain, establishes by force of law\u00a0 the civil status of the child whose\u00a0 acknowledgment is necessarily imposed upon the guilty party; so with much less reason could the crime fall within the jurisdiction of the justice of the peace court, inasmuch as, in accordance with specific legal provisions,\u00a0 only the judge of the Court of First Instance can make such pronouncements.<br\/><br\/>Under this hypothesis, the justice of the peace of Mariquina was not competent and\u00a0 could not possibly have had jurisdiction to hear and try the case for the crime of seduction brought before him by\u00a0 Saturnino Mesina, the father of the offended girl, Isidora Mesina, as he did, rendering judgment on June 10, 1909,\u00a0 with the\u00a0 findings\u00a0 recorded on folio 7 of the trial record; and therefore, all the proceedings had\u00a0 in\u00a0 the said case, together with the judgment, are null and\u00a0 void, and the judge of the Court of First Instance, before whom the case came on appeal by the accused, should have dismissed the same, as it was an action that was null and unsustainable for the reasons aforementioned; hence he could not legally have considered the complaint filed by the provincial fiscal by reason of the said appeal of the accused, inasmuch as,\u00a0 in order to try the crime which was the subject of that\u00a0 complaint, the judge of the Court of First Instance had to act by virtue of his original jurisdiction; in the present case he could not lawfully do so because that complaint was\u00a0 founded\u00a0 on the action tried before the justice of the peace which had come to the Court of First Instance on appeal, and the judge of First\u00a0 Instance\u00a0 had\u00a0 to hear and try the case by virtue of the jurisdiction which he had acquired by reason of the appeal pending in\u00a0 second instance.\u00a0\u00a0 It would be improper to conclude that the said judge exercised the attributes of both courts\u00a0 at the same time by virtue of his original jurisdiction and of the appeal.<br\/><br\/>After the case had been dismissed,\u00a0 and\u00a0 the\u00a0 proceedings had before the justice of the peace, together with his decision in the matter, had been declared null and void, the judge of First Instance, in the exercise of his original jurisdiction, could have given, in accordance with the law, due course to the complaint which would then have been presented by the provincial fiscal independently of the aforesaid proceedings, which were\u00a0 improperly\u00a0 instituted\u00a0 owing to the absolute lack of jurisdiction on the part of the justice of the peace to hear and try causes for the\u00a0 crime of seduction,\u00a0 for\u00a0 the reasons herein before set\u00a0 forth.<br\/><br\/>In the case of Carroll and Ballesteros <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>.

The prosecuting officer, however, can substitute his own complaint for that filed in the justice of the peace court, provided the nature of the action is not changed.\u00a0 In this jurisdiction no provision is made for an appeal from justice of the peace courts upon the law only, but all appeals are taken for a new trial, and the defendant\u00a0 is entitled to\u00a0 interpose\u00a0 the same objections as he could have interposed in the justice of the peace courts.<br\/><br\/>\"If the\u00a0 sentence imposed upon him by the justice of the peace is void for want of jurisdiction of the subject\u00a0 matter, the defendant, on appeal, has a right to have the appellate court so determine, or he may elect to have the Court of First Instance try\u00a0 the case upon its merits, without\u00a0 raising the question of the jurisdiction of the justice of the peace:\u00a0 If he raises no objection with reference to the\u00a0 jurisdiction of the justice of the peace and submits himself to be retried for the crime for which he was charged, then he will be presumed to have waived all questions as to jurisdiction, and he can not thereafter raise this question of jurisdiction, provided the appellate, court had jurisdiction of his person and the subject matter.\u00a0\u00a0 But should he make a timely objection in the appellate court as to the want or excess of jurisdiction of the justice of the peace, and should the court find such objection well founded, then it acquires jurisdiction only for the purpose of dismissing the same, without prejudice however to the institution of a new proceeding for the same criminal\u00a0 acts in the proper tribunal.\u00a0 But in order to take advantage\u00a0 of these rights the\u00a0 appellant must by\u00a0 proper objection call the attention of the court to these facts and give the court an opportunity to pass upon the validity of such\u00a0 sentence; otherwise he will be, as we have said, presumed to have waived the\u00a0 question of\u00a0 jurisdiction.\u00a0 No agreement of the parties, or waiver of objection, can confer jurisdiction on an appellate court which has no jurisdiction of the subject matter.\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>\"In 24 Cyc, 641, it\u00a0 is said:<br\/><br\/>\" 'On appeal from a justice of the peace, the appellate court has only such jurisdiction as the justice had, and if he had no jurisdiction, the appellate court acquires none; and it is immaterial\u00a0 that such court has original jurisdiction of the subject matter of the action.'<br\/><br\/>\"A number of cases from various States in the American Union are cited in support of this proposition.\u00a0\u00a0 It must be noted that this rule is based upon the theory that the\u00a0 appellate court had jurisdiction of the subject\u00a0 matter\u00a0 of the action.<br\/><br\/>\"On page 643 of the\u00a0 same volume (24 Gyc.) it is said:<br\/><br\/>\" 'While it\u00a0 has been held\u00a0 that, where the justice of the peace had no jurisdiction of the subject matter of an action, the parties can not confer jurisdiction on the appellate court by consent,\u00a0 the better view seems to be that where the appellate court has original as\u00a0 well as appellate\u00a0 jurisdiction of the cause, jurisdiction of both the subject\u00a0 matter and the person\u00a0 may be\u00a0 conferred upon\u00a0 it by waiver or consent.'\u00a0\u00a0 (Citing\u00a0 cases\u00a0 from Alabama, Colorado,\u00a0 Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, and Ohio.)<br\/><br\/>\" 'The question\u00a0 of want of jurisdiction may be raised by motion to\u00a0 dismiss the proceedings, or by objecting\u00a0 at the trial\u00a0 to the introduction of any evidence\u00a0 on behalf of plaintiff.'\u00a0 Id.<br\/><center><br\/>*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*<br\/><\/center> <br\/>\"2.

The position of the majority of the court is that\u00a0 courts of justice of the peace have no jurisdiction over the\u00a0 crime of seduction because of that provision of the law by\u00a0 which the court must, in addition to\u00a0 the imprisonment which the accused must suffer, require him to acknowledge and maintain the offspring and to compensate\u00a0 (endow) the mother for the wrong done her. It\u00a0 is admitted that but for these requirements the court would have jurisdiction of this cause inasmuch as the penalty imposed\u00a0 (<i>arresto mayor<\/i>) can not exceed six months' imprisonment.\u00a0\u00a0 The theory of the court is that the requirements above mentioned are<i> a part of the punishment<\/i>; and this being true, and it being also true that courts of justice of the peace are not authorized to impose any other punishment than imprisonment or\u00a0 fine,\u00a0 or\u00a0 both,\u00a0 the necessary result is that the provision\u00a0 of the\u00a0 law\u00a0 requiring the court to order the accused to acknowledge and maintain the offspring and to endow the injured woman carries the cause beyond his jurisdiction.\u00a0 If this be so, then there is an end of courts of justice of the peace so far as their most important criminal jurisdiction\u00a0 is concerned; for the Penal Code\u00a0 requires (arts. 17, 119 to 126) and this court has repeatedly held that, in addition to\u00a0 the penalty imposed as punishment,\u00a0 every court shall also require\u00a0 the accused, in all cases where an actionable injury\u00a0 has been sustained by the commission of the crime, to make (1)\u00a0 <i>restitution,<\/i> or (2) <i>reparation for the^ damage caused,<\/i> or (3) <i>indemnification for losses<\/i>\u00a0 caused by the commission\u00a0 of the\u00a0 crime.<br\/><br\/>While it may be true that an indemnification or a reparation is a part of the\u00a0 punishment in the sense that such indemnification or reparation is not a contractual obligation and therefore\u00a0 imprisonment for failure to pay\u00a0 a sum assessed by the court as an indemnification or reparation is not an imprisonment for debt (U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Freeman, 217 U. S., 639), nevertheless\u00a0 it is equally undoubted that in the real sense, in the true\u00a0 legal sense, a requirement that the accused, in a case of seduction, for example, shall acknowledge and maintain the offspring and suitably endow the mother, is an obligation which may be enforced in\u00a0 a civil action and is simply\u00a0 and\u00a0 solely an indemnification\u00a0 or reparation for\u00a0 damages suffered by\u00a0 reason of the crime committed. This is\u00a0 evident from\u00a0 the\u00a0 provisions\u00a0 of article 449 of the Penal Code which follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Those guilty of rape,\u00a0 seduction, or abduction\u00a0 shall be condemned\u00a0 also, by way of <i>indemnification: <\/i>1.\u00a0 To endow the injured woman, if she were unmarried or a\u00a0 widow; 2; To acknowledge the offspring, if the character of its origin should not\u00a0 prevent\u00a0 it; 3.\u00a0 In all cases, to\u00a0 support the offspring.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It\u00a0 being\u00a0 entirely clear\u00a0 that this\u00a0 article\u00a0 seeks merely reparation or indemnification, and\u00a0 punishment only by indirection, if at\u00a0 all, it follows necessarily that, if such courts can not,\u00a0 in their judgments of conviction, require the reparation or indemnification provided in cases of seduction for the reason that they have no jurisdiction to do so, by parity of reasoning, they can not require it in any other case where the acts\u00a0 constituting the crime have caused an actionable injury.\u00a0\u00a0 There is\u00a0 not the slightest difference, legally or morally,\u00a0 between requiring an accused to support a child and\u00a0 indemnify the\u00a0 woman he has grossly abused, and requiring a thief to pay to a person robbed the value of the property stolen, or compelling a person convicted of assault and battery to\u00a0 pay\u00a0 a certain sum as an indemnification to the person injured\u00a0 thereby.\u00a0 If he lacks the power in the one case, he lacks\u00a0 it in the other.\u00a0 The law\u00a0 imposes the duty and obligation on every court,\u00a0 in proper cases, not only to convict, <i>but also to require the accused to repair the damage\u00a0 done - to indemnify. <\/i> If the imposition of the\u00a0 indemnity or the obligation to repair carries the cause beyond their jurisdiction, then courts of justice of the peace have no jurisdiction over any criminal cause where there results from the commission of the crime actionable injury. This can not but be so, inasmuch as the duty to require indemnification or reparation is laid upon them <i>in\u00a0 every criminal case of that character. <\/i><br\/><br\/>Even\u00a0 though the law did not\u00a0 absolutely require\u00a0 such court to impose\u00a0 indemnification or reparation, still there could not be the\u00a0 slightest question that, if he had\u00a0 jurisdiction, he <i>might<\/i> do so; and this court has uniformly held that the jurisdiction of courts\u00a0 of justice of the peace in criminal,cases is determined by the maximum and not the minimum penalty prescribed by law as punishment for the crime.\u00a0\u00a0 If\u00a0 the maximum\u00a0 penalty, therefore, is not six months'\u00a0 imprisonment and P200 fine, but six\u00a0 months and P200 and indemnification, such courts fail wholly of\u00a0 jurisdiction.<br\/><br\/>Let us suppose that an accused is brought before a court of justice of the\u00a0 peace\u00a0 charged with the theft\u00a0 of a ring worth ten pesos.\u00a0\u00a0 The ring can not be found.\u00a0 The accused pleads guilty.\u00a0 Is it not the manifest, is it not the imperative, duty of the courts under the\u00a0 uniform holding of this court, to require\u00a0 the accused to indemnify the person\u00a0 robbed in the sum of PIO?\u00a0 Article 17 of the Penal\u00a0 Code provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"Every person\u00a0 criminally liable for a crime\u00a0 or misdemeanor is also civilly liable.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Articles\u00a0 119 to\u00a0 122 read as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"ART. 119. The civil liability, established in Chapter II, Title II, of this book, includes: (1)\u00a0 Restitution; (2) reparation for the damage caused;\u00a0 (3) indemnification for losses.<br\/><br\/>\"ART. 120. The restitution of the thing itself must\u00a0 be made,\u00a0 if possible,\u00a0 with payment for\u00a0 deteriorations\u00a0 or diminution of value, to be appraised by the court.<br\/><br\/>\"Restitution shall be made, even though the thing may be in the possession of a third person, who had acquired it in a legal manner, reserving, however, his action against the proper person.<br\/><br\/>\"This provision is not applicable to a case in which the third person has acquired the thing in the manner and with the requisites established by law to make it unrecoverable.<br\/><br\/>\"Art. 121.

The civil, though tortious, incident, the loss to the individual affected by the\u00a0 crime,\u00a0 has nothing whatever to do\u00a0 with jurisdiction.\u00a0 It had its part in influencing the minds of the lawmakers when they were seeking an adequate punishment for the crime.\u00a0\u00a0 But when the legislature had\u00a0 acted and fixed the punishment by its law, the civil incident, the loss to the person injured by the crime, ceased to have any influence whatever on\u00a0 the punishment imposed.\u00a0 The jurisdiction of courts of justice of the peace over crimes being determined exclusively by the amount\u00a0 of the fine and imprisonment imposed by law, that is, by the legal nature of the crime, and in no\u00a0 manner and to no extent whatever by the civil incidents which accrue to the person injured by the commisson of said crime,\u00a0 such courts have\u00a0 jurisdiction of the crime presented in\u00a0 the case at bar, the punishment prescribed by\u00a0 law for such crime being simply <i>arresto mayor.<\/i><br\/><br\/>As I have before intimated,\u00a0 indemnification (I use this word to include\u00a0 reparation and restitution) is not a\u00a0 part of the punishment, as that word is used in the Penal Code. We have already seen that articles 17,119-126 of the Penal Code\u00a0 speak of a civil liability only.\u00a0 Chapter II, Title II, of which article 17 is the first article, is headed by the words, in capital letters, \"Persons <i>civilly <\/i>liable for crimes and misdemeanors.\"\u00a0 Title IV, which is composed of articles\u00a0 119- 126, has these words at its head: \"<i>Civil<\/i> Liability.\"\u00a0\u00a0 The fact that the law relating to the civil liability resulting from the commission of crimes and misdemeanors\u00a0 is found in the Penal Code and\u00a0 goes conjoined with the law relating to criminal liability,\u00a0 and that both are determined in the same action at the same time and in the same judgment,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 is due to the legal system rather than to the nature of those liabilities or their relation to each other.\u00a0 Under that system the criminal action for punishment by\u00a0 the people and the civil action for damages by the person injured by the commission\u00a0 of the crime were conducted together.\u00a0 This was not only a matter of convenience.\u00a0 It appears to have been a necessary result of that principle of Spanish law\u00a0 which determined that\u00a0 an acquittal of one charged with a crime was a bar to a subsequent civil action founded on the same acts.\u00a0\u00a0 The fact that it was so done did not signify that the judgments resulting from these two kinds of liability were both\u00a0 punishments\u00a0 for the crime.\u00a0 It\u00a0 did not mean that they bore any such relation to each other.\u00a0 The Penal Code continually distinguished as it now distinguishes\u00a0 the two kinds of liability, invariably speaking of the one as criminal and the other as <i>civil<\/i> liability.\u00a0\u00a0 Not for a moment are they confused.\u00a0 They\u00a0 are always dealt with separately.\u00a0 It is provided that the injured person\u00a0 may, if he chooses, come into court and renounce his right to damages; and such renunciation will preclude the court from imposing\u00a0 the corresponding indemnification.\u00a0\u00a0 Article 23 of the Penal Code provides that \"civil liability with regard to the interests of the party condoning an offense is extinguished by express renunciation.\"\u00a0 It is\u00a0 provided also that the injured person may compromise with the accused the civil liability under which\u00a0 he\u00a0 lies and that such compromise will relieve the accused from the imposition of an indemnity.\u00a0\u00a0 (Civil Code, art. 1813;\u00a0 Penal Code, art. 23; U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Montaner, 8 Phil. Rep.,\u00a0 620; U, S. <i>vs<\/i>. Leano, 6\u00a0 Phil. Rep., 368;\u00a0 U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Guzman, 1 Phil. Rep., 138; U. S.<i> vs.<\/i> Zamora, 2 Phil. Rep., 582; U.

Valdez, 1 Phil. Rep., 146.)\u00a0\u00a0 This court has also, held many times that courts of justice of the peace have jurisdiction in all cases where the punishment imposed is <i><i>arresto mayor <\/i><\/i>in\u00a0 any or all of its grades.\u00a0 Section 108 of\u00a0 the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that \"the criminal\u00a0 jurisdiction of justices of the peace is extended to all offenses which the Penal Code designates as punishable by <i>arresto mayor<\/i> in all its grades.\"<br\/><br\/>All of this goes to show that, while the\u00a0 two proceedings, civil and criminal, under the Spanish system,\u00a0 progress side by\u00a0 side and are terminated at the same time and by the same judgment, they have been and are, nevertheless, considered as entirely different proceedings which, while having a common\u00a0 origin,\u00a0 present naught else in\u00a0 common;\u00a0 that,\u00a0 while joined in practice, they are wholly separate in nature.<br\/><br\/>Nor is this in conflict with the case of U. S. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>. Freeman, above cited.\u00a0 In that case the only question before the court was whether or not imprisonment imposed by reason of a failure to pay an indemnity was imprisonment for debt and therefore in violation of the provisions\u00a0 of the Act of July 1, 1902.\u00a0 Inasmuch as the Supreme\u00a0 Court of\u00a0 the United States has uniformly held that the provisions\u00a0 referred to relate and refer only to \"liabilities arising upon their contracts\" (McCool <i>vs.<\/i> State,\u00a0 23 Ind.,\u00a0 127,\u00a0 129;\u00a0 Musser <i>vs.<\/i> Stewart, 21 Ohio State, 353;<i> Ex parte <\/i>Cottrell, 13 Neb., 193; <i>In re<\/i> Ebenhack, 17 Kan., 618, 622), the only question presented in that case for decision was\u00a0 whether the obligation to indemnify was or was not\u00a0 contractual.\u00a0 It clearly not being contractual, the cause was fully resolved.\u00a0 The question whether or not indemnification was a part of the criminal penalty was not involved and was not discussed.\u00a0 Those expressions which refer to the indemnity, or \"the imposition of the money penalty,\" as being a part of the<i> \"punishment\"<\/i> do not militate against this assertion.\u00a0 <i> Punishment<\/i> is not necessarily a penalty; and if it were, the phrases in which the word was\u00a0 used were written for the purpose\u00a0 only of indicating the difference between such an indemnity or money penalty and a contractual obligation,\u00a0 and\u00a0 in\u00a0 no wise to demonstrate that\u00a0 such a money\u00a0 penalty\u00a0 was\u00a0 a <i> criminal<\/i> penalty or <i>punishment.<br\/><\/i><br\/>The prevailing\u00a0 opinion lays great stress\u00a0 on the fact that, under\u00a0 article 449, aboVe quoted, the court\u00a0 is\u00a0 required to adjudicate\u00a0 the civil status of the\u00a0 offspring, arguing that a matter so important as the civil\u00a0 status of a person ought not to be lodged in a court of justice of the peace.\u00a0\u00a0 I do not think that this contention has any force.\u00a0 In the first place, it must be presumed that the lawmakers,\u00a0 in giving courts of justice of the peace jurisdiction of certain crimes, among them seduction, knew what punishments the law had prescribed for said crimes and what their civil incidents were. They would not have based their grant of jurisdiction over said crimes upon\u00a0 the fine and imprisonment prescribed for each and then have immediately avoided that grant by the necessity of imposing the consequences of the civil incident. The lawmakers knew that they had created laws which not only punished crimes by fine and imprisonment, but gave them civil incidents also, indemnification for\u00a0 which must be imposed at the same time and in the same judgment with the fine and imprisonment. Knowing this, is it not absurd to say that they based the jurisdiction of courts of justice of the peace wholly upon the<i> fine and imprisonment<\/i>, knowing that their\u00a0 work would be utterly in\u00a0 vain inasmuch as such jurisdiction would be instantly divested by the necessity of imposing an\u00a0 indemnification founded\u00a0 upon the civil incident?\u00a0 It would be utter folly for the lawmakers solemnly to create a law giving a court jurisdiction over a certain class\u00a0 of crimes, well knowing that it had already enacted a law which would render it utterly impossible for such courts to assume the jurisdiction thus solemnly tendered.\u00a0 In other words, it would be puerile for the Philippine Commission to pass a law giving a justice jurisdiction of all\u00a0 crimes the penalty for which does not exceed six months and P200, well knowing at the time that such courts could not possibly assume\u00a0 such\u00a0 jurisdiction by reason of another law previously, or at the time, enacted by the same Commission providing for restitution, reparation, or indemnification by the criminal.\u00a0 It would be a violence to the good sense of the Philippine Commission to assert that by one law it gave the courts of justice of the peace jurisdiction over the crime\u00a0 committed by stealing a ring worth P10,\u00a0 and\u00a0 then instantly, by\u00a0 the same\u00a0 or another\u00a0 law,\u00a0 took\u00a0 away\u00a0 that jurisdiction by obliging the courts in their judgments of conviction to require the accused\u00a0 to restore the ring or pay its value to the owner.\u00a0\u00a0 It\u00a0 is not reasonable\u00a0 to say that the Philippine Commission gave jurisdiction with one hand and on the same instant took it away with\u00a0 the other.\u00a0 Cognizance of the crimes in which the.criminal is required to indemnify, to\u00a0 restore, or repair constitutes by far the most important part of the criminal attributes of courts of justice of the peace.\u00a0\u00a0 If such courts have not jurisdiction\u00a0 of these\u00a0 crimes,\u00a0 then their usefulness as inferior\u00a0 criminal tribunals is almost at an end.\u00a0 In order to sustain the theory of the majority opinion, it must be\u00a0 held that the legislature perpetrated this absurdity.<br\/><br\/>In the second place, when the legislature gave jurisdiction over a\u00a0 specific and well-defined class of crimes, namely, all those the punishment for which did not exceed a<i> fine<\/i> of P200 and an imprisonment\u00a0 of six months, it must necessarily be presumed that it gave\u00a0 the court at the same time jurisdiction and power to handle every incident of that crime. The crime itself contains and embraces all of its incidents. No incident is greater than the act which caused it; and no number of incidents can\u00a0 be greater than the\u00a0 crime which they compose.\u00a0\u00a0 Jurisdiction\u00a0 over the crime is\u00a0 inevitably jurisdiction over every\u00a0 incident of that crime.\u00a0 While this might not be true under American\u00a0 jurisdiction, it is true here where the penal law requires,\u00a0 and this court has repeatedly sustained such requirement, that the same judgment\u00a0 which imposes <i>fine and imprisonment<\/i> for the crime shall also impose upon the culprit restitution, reparation, or indemnification as the incidents of that crime.\u00a0 To say that jurisdiction is determined by the incident of the\u00a0 crime and not by the crime itself, as that crime is defined by its criminal penalty, is not\u00a0 only to overrule and\u00a0 override the plain and explicit provisions of the statute\u00a0 law, but\u00a0 is to make the part far greater than the whole.\u00a0 Nowhere does the statute provide that the jurisdiction\u00a0 of a court of justice of the peace shall depend upon\u00a0 the\u00a0 civil incidents of a criminal act. The exact and express contrary is the plain wording of the law.\u00a0 It provides that the\u00a0 jurisdiction shall depend solely and exclusively upon the <i>fine and imprisonment<\/i>, those things which the people exact from\u00a0 a criminal in satisfaction of their outraged law in\u00a0 payment for the damage done to society, and not upon\u00a0 the civil incidents of the crime, those things in which the public, or society, has no interest as such.\u00a0\u00a0 To hold that the civil incident determines whether the court of justice of the peace or\u00a0 the Court\u00a0 of First Instance has jurisdiction,\u00a0 and not the\u00a0 punishment which society metes out to the malefactor,\u00a0 is to reverse the jurisprudence of the criminal law.<br\/><br\/>In the third place, if the legislature had not intended to give courts of justice of the peace jurisdiction over the incidents of the crime as well as the crime itself, it would unquestionably have said so.\u00a0 Upon what rational theory may we hold that the legislature said to a court of justice:<br\/><blockquote>\"You shall have and\u00a0 must take jurisdiction of\u00a0 all crimes where the punishment prescribed does not exceed a fine of two hundred pesos and imprisonment for six months.\u00a0 In all those crimes, in addition to this penalty, you shall impose also on the culprit indemnification; but if you do impose indemnification you lose jurisdiction\u00a0 of the crime.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The civil jurisdiction of a court of justice\u00a0 is confined to causes where the amount in controversy does not exceed P200. Yet the fact that, in an action of forcible entry and detainer, he might be required\u00a0 to render a judgment for P10,000 or more does\u00a0 not deprive him of jurisdiction of that action. He has complete\u00a0 jurisdiction to enter\u00a0 judgment in\u00a0 any amount.\u00a0 On the same principle, such court, having jurisdiction of the crime of seduction <i>by virtue of the character of the criminal penalty prescribed by the law,<\/i> is not deprived of jurisdiction\u00a0 thereof, simply because he may possibly be required to impose an indemnification of one or a thousand pesos or require an acknowledgment of parentage of the offspring and the maintenance of the samel\u00a0 The legislature had these things in mind when it gave that court jurisdiction of the crime.\u00a0\u00a0 In most of the States of the Union justices of the peace have jurisdiction of bastardy proceedings and are competent to do the very things which are held to be beyond their jurisdiction by the\u00a0 prevailing opinion.<br\/><br\/>I can not insist too\u00a0 strongly on the proposition that it is the <i>fine and imprisonment<i> <\/i>which determines jurisdiction, and not the <\/i>civil incidents.\u00a0 The civil incident is in no sense a <i>fine or imprisonment.<\/i>\u00a0\u00a0 Imprisonment may result from its imposition\u00a0 in terms of money; but\u00a0 it is\u00a0 not imprisonment as that term is used and understood in the criminal law.\u00a0 Certainly it is not the \"six months' imprisonment\" contemplated by\u00a0 the statute, which is one\u00a0 of the constituent elements determining jurisdiction.\u00a0 If the incidents of a crime are of so grave and important a character that a court of justice of the peace ought not to be permitted to deal with them, then the acts which gave them birth ought to be so qualified by law that such court would have no jurisdiction of the crime which those acts constitute.\u00a0 The punishment of crime is largely determined by the amount of damage or extent of the injury generally caused by its commission.\u00a0 One of the strongest elements\u00a0 going to influence the mind of the legislature in prescribing an\u00a0 adequate punishment\u00a0 of\u00a0 a crime\u00a0 is.the injury which\u00a0 the commission of\u00a0 that\u00a0 crime usually causes.\u00a0\u00a0 In fixing the\u00a0 punishment for the crime of seduction, the legislature fully\u00a0 considered the injury which the commission\u00a0 of that crime would\u00a0 generally cause and was fully aware of all\u00a0 the deplorable results which might follow it\u00a0 Yet,\u00a0 knowing all this, it deliberately prescribed the penalty of <i>arresto mayor.<\/i>\u00a0 This, upon the face of the law, gave courts of justice of the peace jurisdiction over it. May we now say that the legislature did not fully appreciate the consequences of this crime and that it erred in giving such courts jurisdiction thereof; that the crime was more serious than the lawmakers believed\u00a0 it to\u00a0 be and that it should have been placed under the control\u00a0 of a\u00a0 higher tribunal?\u00a0 Can\u00a0 we say that it is more important to protect the rights of the person injured by the commission of the crime than to protect those\u00a0 of\u00a0 society\u00a0 itself?\u00a0 May we say that in cases of seduction the interests of society are safe with a justice\u00a0 of the peace but justice requires\u00a0 that the interests of the\u00a0 injured party be submitted to a more competent tribunal?<br\/><br\/>As we have seen, courts of justice of the peace have jurisdiction of all offenses where the penalty prescribed by law does not exceed six months' imprisonment and a fine of P200. The statute\u00a0 [Act No. 136,\u00a0 sec. 56] defining\u00a0 the criminal jurisdiction of Courts of First Instance is merely the complement\u00a0 of\u00a0 that prescribing the jurisdiction\u00a0 of courts of justice of the peace.\u00a0 It follows:<br\/><br\/>\"Courts of First Instance shall have original jurisdiction:<br\/><center><br\/>*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * <br\/><\/center> <blockquote>\"(<i>f)<\/i> In all criminal cases, in which a penalty of more than\u00a0 six\u00a0 months' imprisonment or a\u00a0 fine exceeding two hundred pesos may be imposed.\"<\/blockquote>These two courts, justice of the peace and First Instance, can not have jurisdiction of the same crimes concurrently. If one has it the other does not.\u00a0 If the Court\u00a0 of First Instance has jurisdiction there is an end of the matter so far as the court of justice of the peace is concerned.\u00a0\u00a0 If the latter court has it the question is closed so far as the Court of First Instance\u00a0 is concerned.\u00a0 The jurisdiction of\u00a0 each depends not upon the <i>civil incidents<\/i> of the crime but upon the <i>criminal penalty<\/i> prescribed for the crime; upon the damage done to society and not to the damage done to an <i>individual.<\/i>\u00a0 The injury to the individual is, from the stand-point of society,\u00a0 merely an incidental matter; and while the crime and its incidents run along together\u00a0 in. the same case, at the\u00a0 same time and before the same court, this circumstance in no way alters their natures or relations.\u00a0 The incidents were taken into consideration when the act which created them was made a crime and punished in accordance with those incidents.\u00a0 They,\u00a0 having entered as the most potential factor into the determination of the penalty which should be imposed for the act causing them, can not again exercise that influence by determining what court shall have jurisdiction of the crime which they had so great a part in making.\u00a0\u00a0 They can not weigh twice against the accused by becoming a\u00a0 part of the penalty, the nature, measure, and extent of which they were the greatly predominant factors in prescribing.\u00a0 These\u00a0 incidents really determined,\u00a0 in the minds\u00a0 of the\u00a0 lawmakers, what the penalty of the crime should be.\u00a0 Is it logically or legally possible that they\u00a0 may now become a part of that same penalty?\u00a0 The legislature, as we have said before, in determining the punishment which ought to follow a given wrongful act, views the results or incidents which generally follow\u00a0 the\u00a0 commission of\u00a0 that wrongful\u00a0 act,\u00a0 and, from those results, and almost wholly by reason of them, fixes the criminal penalty in accordance therewith.\u00a0 The culprit,\u00a0 having\u00a0 suffered\u00a0 such criminal penalty, has been\u00a0 once punished criminally by <i>reason of those incidents.<\/i>\u00a0 If, therefore, it be held that those incidents again enter into his case as a part of the <i>criminal penalty,<\/i> he has been punished by society twice for the same act.\u00a0 It may be\u00a0 said,\u00a0 to be sure,\u00a0 that he ought to suffer again for the injuries inflicted\u00a0 on the individual\u00a0 and that in substantially all of the American States he may be imprisoned under a body execution issued upon a judgment obtained in a civil action of tort founded upon such injuries.\u00a0\u00a0 That is true.\u00a0\u00a0 But the point is that he does not again\u00a0 suffer <i> criminally.<\/i>\u00a0 He suffers civilly only. My point is that, if indemnification or reparation is a part of the\u00a0 penalty, as claimed\u00a0 by the majority\u00a0 of the court, then those incidents have twice been used to the same end - once in determining, through\u00a0 their\u00a0 influence on the lawmakers, the <i>amount<\/i> of the penalty,\u00a0 and once as a part of the penalty.\u00a0 While the <i>time<\/i> of imprisonment may\u00a0 be\u00a0 the same tinder the two theories, the character\u00a0 of the imprisonment id wholly\u00a0 different.\u00a0 It may be said that the practical result is about the same.\u00a0 But the principle is, nevertheless, vicious in the extreme.\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, it may well\u00a0 be doubted whether the practical results are the same.\u00a0\u00a0 If the \"incidents\" are a part of the penalty, then in many cases, as in the one\u00a0 at bar, the jurisdiction, and consequently\u00a0 the\u00a0 trial, is changed from the court\u00a0 of justice of the peace to the Court of First Instance.\u00a0 Instead of being\u00a0 tried\u00a0 in his own locality, where he is known, where he has lived his life, where his reputation has been made, and in the home of all\u00a0 his witnesses, the culprit must stand his trial\u00a0 in the distant capital of the province, where he is wholly Unknown, whereto all his witnesses must be taken, and where the expenses of his trial are greatly increased. Not only this.\u00a0 The costs of court which, if convicted, he must pay either in money or in jail, are much greater.\u00a0 The same may be said in relation to his appeal and the expenses incident\u00a0 thereto.\u00a0\u00a0 Instead of\u00a0 taking his\u00a0 appeal\u00a0 from the judgment of the court of\u00a0 justice of the peace to the Court of First Instance of his own province, he is obliged to take it from the latter court to the Supreme Court at Manila. The additional hardship\u00a0 and expense\u00a0 are manifest.\u00a0 All these things mean that the expenses\u00a0 of his defense are greatly augmented and the time of his\u00a0 imprisonment appreciably increased, all because of the improper holding that indemnification and reparation are a part of the penalty that determines jurisdiction, thereby removing the cause from the cognizance of courts of justice of the peace to those of First Instance.<br\/><br\/>For\u00a0 these reasons, I dissent.<br\/><br\/><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Proceedings and judgment declared null and void.<\/span><br\/><\/div>",

LEONCIO BALLENA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.\n<br\/>\n<br\/>\nD E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TRENT, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">On the 21st of September, 1909, there was tried\u00a0 in the Court of First\u00a0 Instance\u00a0 of the subprovince of\u00a0 Masbate criminal\u00a0 case No. 163, entitled \"United States <i>vs.<\/i>\u00a0 Ana Ramirez,\" in which the defendant was charged with the crime of perjury.\u00a0\u00a0 The basis of this\u00a0 prosecution was the false testimony given by the defendant\u00a0 in\u00a0 a certain\u00a0 criminal case tried in that court wherein one Ciriaco Pellejera was defendant, charged with homicide, in that the said Pellejera did, by means of blows, cause the\u00a0 death of the husband of Ana Ramirez.\u00a0 In\u00a0 this homicide\u00a0 case Ana Ramirez\u00a0 was called as a witness, and,\u00a0 after being duly sworn, testified that her\u00a0 husband died of fever and that during\u00a0 his illness, which lasted more\u00a0 than two weeks, she observed no contusions or other injuries on his body.\u00a0\u00a0 She denied having testified under oath before the provincial fiscal in the town of Dimasalang, contrary to her testimony in this case, and she also denied having been in the house of one Jose Largo for the\u00a0 purpose of testifying with reference to the death of her husband.\u00a0 Whereas, as a\u00a0 matter of fact, she did testify,\u00a0 under oath, before the said fiscal, in that town, that her husband died as a direct result of the blows inflicted by Pellejera and\u00a0 that\u00a0 his\u00a0 death occurred\u00a0 within three days after having received these blows.\u00a0 Ana Ramirez was found guilty as charged and sentenced accordingly.<br\/><br\/>In the trial of this perjury case\u00a0 one Estefania Barruga, mother of the defendant Ana, was a witness for the defendant, and\u00a0 at\u00a0 the instigation of one\u00a0 Leoncio Ballena she testified that the fiscal, Senor Bailon, at the time he was in Dimasalang making the investigation into the\u00a0 cause of the death of Ana's husband, attempted to rape her daughter Ana, and,asked for the hand of the girl in marriage, but she did not desire\u00a0 to accept this\u00a0 proposition of the fiscal because he was a married\u00a0 man.<br\/><br\/>Subsequently\u00a0 thereto, and on the 29th\u00a0 of\u00a0 September, 1909, the fiscal filed an information in the\u00a0 Court\u00a0 of First Instance\u00a0 of that province\u00a0 against the said Leoncio Ballena, charging\u00a0 him with\u00a0 the crime of\u00a0 subornation of\u00a0 perjury.<br\/><br\/>Upon this complaint the defendant was duly tried, found guilty, and sentenced to six months' imprisonment, to pay a fine of P500, to the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment in\u00a0 case of insolvency, to the accessory penalties provided for by law, and to pay the costs.\u00a0\u00a0 From this sentence and judgment the defendant appealed, and now insists that the testimony given\u00a0 by Estefania Barruga in that perjury case was immaterial to the issues involved therein. If this contention be true, the defendant is\u00a0 not guilty.<br\/><br\/>There are\u00a0 certain\u00a0 well-defined and\u00a0 indispensable requisites which must be established in every case of subornation of\u00a0 perjury before\u00a0 an accused\u00a0 person, charged with the commission of this crime, can be convicted.\u00a0 Every essential element\u00a0 constituting\u00a0 the crime of perjury must be established by competent testimony.\u00a0\u00a0 The prosecution must show the nature of the proceedings in which\u00a0 the alleged perjury was committed, the court, or officer, in which,\u00a0 or before whom, the false oath\u00a0 was taken;\u00a0 that the\u00a0 witness\u00a0 was duly sworn; that the testimony was material, and false; that the defendant knowingly and willfully procured another to swear falsely, and that the witness suborned did testify under circumstances rendering him guilty of perjury.<br\/><br\/>In the\u00a0 case at bar the record shows beyond any question of a doubt that the witness Barruga, after being duly sworn, did knowingly and willfully testify falsely in a criminal case before a\u00a0 duly constituted tribunal; that this witness so testified at\u00a0 the\u00a0 instigation\u00a0 of the defendant\u00a0 Ballena; and that the\u00a0\u00a0 defendant knew\u00a0 that the\u00a0 testimony given by the witness Barruga was false.\u00a0 The witness so informed the defendant.\u00a0\u00a0 Notwithstanding this information, the defendant strongly insisted that by the witness Barruga testifying that the\u00a0 fiscal committed those acts would be the only way to save her daughter from imprisonment.\u00a0 The defendant not. only knowingly and willfully induced this witness to swear\u00a0 falsely, but he did so maliciously, as it appears from the record that he was an enemy of\u00a0 the fiscal at that time, the fiscal having prosecuted him\u00a0 previous to this trial.\u00a0\u00a0 So the only question to be determined is, as we have said, Was the testimony of Barruga material to the\u00a0 issues involved in that criminal case against her daughter\u00a0 for\u00a0 perjury? Materiality is an essential element in the crime of perjury. (U.\u00a0 S. <i>vs.<\/i> Estrafia,\u00a0 16 Phil. Rep., 520.)\u00a0\u00a0 It, therefore, necessarily follows that materiality is likewise an indispensable requisite in the crime of subornation of perjury, as the latter is derived from the former.<br\/><blockquote>\"The term 'material matter' means the main fact which was\u00a0 the subject of the inquiry, or any circumstance which tends to prove that fact, or any fact, or circumstance, which tends to corroborate or strengthen the testimony relative to such inquiry, or which legitimately affects the credit of any witness who testifies,\"\u00a0 (Quoted with approval in\u00a0 U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Estrana,<i> supra.<\/i>)<br\/><\/blockquote>In the criminal case in which the witness Barruga\u00a0 gave that false testimony, the main question involved was whether or not\u00a0 Ana Ramirez testified before the provincial\u00a0 fiscal that\u00a0 her husband died as a\u00a0 result of the\u00a0 blows inflicted by Ciriaco\u00a0 Pellejera, as she had testified in the trial of the case\u00a0 against Pellejera that she did not so testify before the fiscal.\u00a0\u00a0 It is clear that the false testimony of Ana Ramirez against Pellejera was material.\u00a0 In\u00a0 the trial of\u00a0 the\u00a0 case against Ana for perjury\u00a0 there was presented a question of fact\u00a0 as to whether or not Ana testified,\u00a0 under oath, before the fiscal in that investigation that her husband did in fact die as a result of the wounds inflicted by Pellejera.\u00a0\u00a0 The court found this to be true.\u00a0\u00a0 It was important\u00a0 to know whether or not the fiscal, at\u00a0 the time Ana testified before him,\u00a0 attempted to rape her or asked her mother for permission to marry her.\u00a0 If the fiscal had\u00a0 committed these\u00a0 acts they\u00a0 would\u00a0 have constituted a\u00a0 strong circumstance showing the innocence of Ana.\u00a0 The fiscal was the moving\u00a0 party in the perjury case and it was upon\u00a0 his sworn\u00a0 complaint\u00a0 that Ana was prosecuted.\u00a0 If he should have attempted to prosecute Ana after having committed these acts the court would not only have disbelieved the fiscal, testifying as a witness, but\u00a0 it would have looked\u00a0 upon\u00a0 the whole prosecution as a fabrication.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 judgment\u00a0 appealed from being in accordance with the law and the merits of the case, same is hereby affirmed, with costs against the\u00a0 defendant.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

The Honorable Arthur L. Sanborn, judge of the United States district court for the western district of Wisconsin, in his article entitled \"Mandamus\" (26 Cy. of Law\u00a0 and Procedure (Cyc), at p. 347), said:<br\/><blockquote>\"By the weight of authority\u00a0 mandamus will\u00a0 not lie in ordinary\u00a0 cases to compel a\u00a0 corporation or its\u00a0 officers to transfer stock on its books and issue new certificates to the transferee, since the writ (in such a case) is a purely private one, and there is generally an adequate remedy by an action against the corporation for damages.\"<\/blockquote>In support of this conclusion Judge\u00a0 Sanborn cites cases from the\u00a0 States\u00a0 as follows:<br\/><br\/><i>California.<\/i> -\u00a0 (Kimball <i>vs<\/i>.

These claims might easily arise between the\u00a0 time of the issuance of the writ and the service of the same upon such officers.\u00a0\u00a0 If the court should issue the writ, it might require an officer to transfer stock under conditions where the law expressly prohibited such transfer. The writ of mandamus will never issue to\u00a0 compel a person to violate an express provision of the law.\u00a0 The act required to be performed must be one which the law specially\u00a0 enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station or unlawfully excludes the\u00a0 plaintiff from the use and enjoyment of a\u00a0 right or office to which he is entitled and from which he is\u00a0 unlawfully precluded.\u00a0\u00a0 (Sec. 222 of Act No. 190.)<br\/><br\/>No law has been called to our attention which specially requires the performance\u00a0 of the\u00a0 act of\u00a0 transferring the stock, while there is a law expressly prohibiting its transfer, except under certain conditions.\u00a0\u00a0 (Sec.\u00a0 35, Act No. 1459.)<br\/><br\/>In the case of Tobey <i>vs.<\/i> Hakes (54 Conn., 274) Justice Carpenter,\u00a0 in discussing the question whether mandamus would issue or not, in an application for such writ to compel the secretary of a private corporation to transfer stock on the books of the corporation, to a purchaser,\u00a0 and to issue a certificate therefor, said:<br\/><blockquote>\"This suit is against a private corporation, and its object is to enforce a mere private\u00a0 right.\u00a0 It is in no\u00a0 sense a proceeding to enforce the performance of a\u00a0 public duty. We have no precedent in this\u00a0 State for allowing this writ to\u00a0 compel the transfer of stock in a private\u00a0 corporation, and the authorities elsewhere are against it,\" - citing in support of his conclusions cases: Cushman <i>vs<\/i>.

Harrison (66 Ga., 696).<br\/><\/blockquote>Justice Carpenter continues\u00a0 by saying:<br\/><blockquote>\"There is another ground on\u00a0 which the writ was properly refused.\u00a0 It is familiar law that the writ will not ordinarily issue if the plaintiff has other remedies.\u00a0 If the corporation improperly refuses to transfer the\u00a0 stock it is clearly liable for the damages in an action\u00a0 at law.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In the\u00a0 case of Kimball\u00a0 <i>vs.<\/i> Union Water\u00a0 Company\u00a0 (44 Cal., 173)\u00a0 the supreme court of California said:<br\/><br\/>\"It has been so frequently decided that a\u00a0 party entitled to stock in a private corporation has an action for damages against the corporation\u00a0 for\u00a0 the refusal of\u00a0 its officers to transfer the stock to him\u00a0 upon the company's books, that it must be considered as a settled principle of law.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (King <i>vs<\/i>.

I., for a\u00a0 period\u00a0 of five years.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 lease is\u00a0 evidenced by a notarial document duly executed, which\u00a0 was presented as evidence in this case\u00a0 and marked plaintiff's\u00a0 Exhibit A. The eighth\u00a0 clause of this lease is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"The tenant,\u00a0 Pio\u00a0 de\u00a0 la Guardia Barretto, Si\u00a0 Pioco, shall use the land and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">camarines, <\/span>the subject of this\u00a0 contract, according to the usage and custom of a good tenant, obligating himself to preserve them in good condition.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The lease expired on April 12, 1907.\u00a0\u00a0 The lessee died in the year 1907 shortly before the expiration of the lease.\u00a0 On April 12,\u00a0 1907,\u00a0 the defendant applied in\u00a0 his own name for a lease of the same premises.\u00a0 The agent of the plaintiff was unable at that time to enter into, what is called throughout the case, a\u00a0 permanent lease with the defendant, as he desired to confer with\u00a0 his principal, who was absent from the country. Accordingly a temporary lease of six months was entered into by the parties.\u00a0 At the expiration of the six months, the parties to the lease not being able to agree upon the terms of a permanent lease, the defendant vacated and the premises were leased to other persons.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff,\u00a0 believing that the defendant had\u00a0 failed to comply with the terms of the\u00a0 temporary lease and also that he had an obligation as successor of his deceased father with reference to repairing the buildings as specified\u00a0 in the lease of 1902, commenced this action to recover from the defendant the cost of repairs which the plaintiff claimed were necessary as a result of the use of said premises not only by the defendant under his temporary lease but also by defendant's father under the five-year lease.\u00a0 Judgment was rendered by the\u00a0 court below in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of P3,500 and costs.\u00a0 The defendant appealed.<br\/><br\/>The appellant\u00a0 contends that, according to the terms of the temporary lease, he\u00a0 obligated himself merely to make certain repairs on the leased buildings, not to cost more than P500, and that, during said period of six months, he made said repairs and\u00a0 expended therefor the sum of P481.\u00a0 He admits that he is responsible\u00a0 for the value of the materials lost or stolen during the period covered by his temporary lease, amounting to P500.\u00a0 The appellee insists that as his agent was compelled to expend P5,500 to put the premises in good condition, P2,500 of\u00a0 this amount representing repairs and improvements required by the Board of Health, and P3,000 representing the repairs made necessary by the neglect of the occupants, father and son, to fulfil their agreements, the defendant,\u00a0 under\u00a0 his\u00a0 contract, should be\u00a0 compelled to reimburse him\u00a0 in the amount of the said P3,000 and to pay for the materials lost or stolen, which were worth P500.<br\/><br\/>The temporary lease is contained in certain letters passing between plaintiff's agent and the defendant, the most important of which are the following:<br\/><center><br\/>EXHIBIT B.<br\/><\/center> <br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: right;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"MANILA, <i>April 12, 1907.<\/i><br\/><\/div><br\/><div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\"Se\u00f1or COHN.<br\/><\/div><blockquote>\"DEAR SIR; As heir of my father, Don Pio de la Guardia Barretto, and being over the age of majority, I propose to you the following: \u00a0<br\/><br\/>\"On this date expires the contract of lease of\u00a0 the land and buildings in the\u00a0 barrio of\u00a0 Palomar of this city, which my said father had made and for which he has been paying rental at the rate of P400 per month, in the manner\u00a0 set forth in the contract\u00a0 referred to.<br\/><br\/>\"Now, then, in view of the ruinous condition of the buildings in which the tannery\u00a0 is established, it is necessary to incur expenses, which I calculate at the sum of five hundred pesos,\u00a0 in order that the business may continue for another six months from this date, while the repairs of a permanent character will\u00a0 necessarily\u00a0 represent\u00a0 some\u00a0 thousands\u00a0\u00a0 of pesos, which I can only undertake in the event of a contract favorable to my interests,\u00a0 if you, in your representative capacity, are likewise agreed.<br\/><br\/>\"In consequence of these premises\u00a0 I propose to you the renewal of the contract for six months more, but with the understanding that I will make payments monthly in advance at the rate of P250\u00a0 per month and\u00a0 that the payment of taxes upon the buildings, for the six months, shall be for my account in the manner set forth in the previous contract.<br\/><br\/>\"If, upon the expiration\u00a0 of this extension,\u00a0 it should suit the interests you represent, and mine, to continue the lease, in that event we shall establish the terms which shall govern.<br\/><br\/>\"Awaiting your answer in a\u00a0 letter which can serve as a contract by means of my endorsement of the original and the copia\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 etc., etc.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: right;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"MARIANO R.

Why, to preserve them (the premises)\u00a0 in good condition as required by the lease which the parties were then renewing.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><blockquote>\"We\u00a0 can not see how the requirement of 'necessary repairs' can be regarded as\u00a0 a new\u00a0 element in the\u00a0 contract since the lease which was renewed required the buildings to be kept 'in good condition.'\u00a0 But if it were to be so regarded it would\u00a0 then be in the nature of a counter-proposition by plaintiff\u00a0 which defendant by remaining in\u00a0 possession accepted.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The court allowed the plaintiff P3,000 expended by hi in restoring the buildings to the\u00a0 condition in which he believed the defendant\u00a0 was obliged by his contract to surrender them, and P500 to restore the collapsed\u00a0 portion of the buildings, including the materials lost or stolen. As we have seen, the appellant admits\u00a0 that he promised to make certain repairs not to cost more than P500,\u00a0 and also to be responsible for the materials lost or stolen to the extent of P500.\u00a0 Accordingly, the\u00a0 greater portion of the P3,000 allowed by the court was to cover an expenditure for repairs made necessary by the occupancy\u00a0 of the\u00a0 original tenant.<br\/><br\/>It is true, as appellant says, that the buildings on April 12 (the date of the expiration of the original lease)\u00a0 were in a \"ruinous condition.\"\u00a0\u00a0 We are not now called upon to decide whether or not the estate of the\u00a0 original lessee should reimburse the plaintiff\u00a0 in the amount expended\u00a0 by him in placing the premises in a habitable condition; or,\u00a0 in other words, for repairs which were necessary prior to April 12th. The extent of appellant's responsibility is the only question before us.\u00a0\u00a0 He did not sign the original lease, nor did he participate in any manner in the making or execution of the same.\u00a0 It may be true that\u00a0 he occupied the premises with his father, but the record does\u00a0 not disclose\u00a0 that he obligated himself to repair or assist in repairing the deteriorations occurring while the original lease was in force, unless such responsibility attached\u00a0 by reason of his\u00a0 continuing in possession of the premises under the temporary lease.\u00a0 It is clear\u00a0 that his\u00a0 responsibility to\u00a0 make\u00a0 these repairs did not attach prior to April 12,1907, as the negotiations for the renewal\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 lease\u00a0 started\u00a0 on\u00a0 this date, the first communication on the\u00a0 subject being Exhibit B, in which the appellant stated that\u00a0 his deceased father's lease of\u00a0 the premises expired on that date..\u00a0 Moreover, in the same communication he notified the\u00a0 appellee or his agent that the premises were\u00a0 in a\u00a0 ruinous\u00a0 condition and that it would be necessary to incur expense in repairs in order that\u00a0 the\u00a0 business\u00a0 might continue for another six months, which expense he calculated would amount to P500. In that letter he made it clear that\u00a0 the repairs of a\u00a0 permanent\u00a0 character would necessarily represent\u00a0 thousands of pesos, which he would undertake to make only in the event that a permanent lease favorable to his interests was made.\u00a0\u00a0 He,\u00a0 therefore,\u00a0 proposed\u00a0 a temporary\u00a0 lease for a period of six\u00a0 months,\u00a0 providing\u00a0 for\u00a0 monthly payments of P250 instead\u00a0 of P400\u00a0 (the\u00a0 amount his father\u00a0 had\u00a0 been paying)\u00a0 and with the further stipulation that if, upon the expiration of\u00a0 the six months, he and the\u00a0 appellee's agent could agree, terms would be made for a permanent lease. This offer was accepted by the appellee's agent on April 19, and in accepting it the agent stated among other things:<br\/><blockquote>\"It is\u00a0 understood\u00a0 that you will be obligated to pay the taxes upon the buildings and to make the repairs which may be necessary at the present time.\u00a0\u00a0 It is likewise understood that this lease is extended upon\u00a0 the\u00a0 above terms in order to permit you\u00a0 to make a suitable offer to take this property under lease for a longer period of time.<br\/><br\/>\"In your offer you should make mention of the following points:<br\/><br\/>\"1. Period for which you desire the lease;<br\/><br\/>\"2. The nature of the permanent repairs to be made and their probable cost, and<br\/><br\/>\"3. The rental you will be willing to pay.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>From this we think it clear that the appellant proposed in\u00a0 his\u00a0 first communication to\u00a0 make\u00a0 only\u00a0 such repairs as would permit him to continue his business for a period of six months, as stated.\u00a0 We believe it is clear also that the agent accepted appellant's proposition, with the understanding that the appellant proposed to make temporary repairs which should cost not more than\u00a0 P500.\u00a0\u00a0 Otherwise it is difficult to understand, among other things, why the agent requested the appellant in his offer for a permanent lease to state the nature of the permanent repairs to be made and their probable cost.\u00a0\u00a0 The reduction in the monthly rental in the temporary lease was made on account of the condition of the premises.\u00a0 Naturally, the appellant would not consent to pay P400\u00a0 a month for premises in which, by reason of their dilapidated condition, his business could not be carried on except with great difficulty and great additional expense, when such premises were worth\u00a0 only P400 a month when in good condition.\u00a0 The agent in his letter of May 23 states:<br\/><blockquote>\"Permit me to call your attention to the fact that up to this date you\u00a0 have not submitted to me your proposal for the lease of the land and buildings at Palomar.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The appellant made his proposals in his communication of October 7th, but the agent refused\u00a0 to accept them.\u00a0\u00a0 The agent in his communication declining to accept the proposals of the appellant requested him to\u00a0 proceed within the period of fifteen days to make the repairs upon the premises to an amount equal to P1,000, and in his communication, dated December 4th,\u00a0 said:<br\/><blockquote>\"And I find myself obliged now to demand that you pay me the sum of one thousand pesos in\u00a0 cash.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>This one thousand pesos was made up of the five hundred pesos which the appellant agreed to expend on temporary repairs\u00a0 and P500 the value of the lost materials for which the appellant admits he is responsible.\u00a0 The terms of these communications are so clear and explicit that it is not necessary to go outside of them to. ascertain the intention of the parties.<br\/><br\/>The appellant proposed to renew or enter into\u00a0 a\u00a0 temporary lease for\u00a0 six months, obliging himself to expend hot more\u00a0 than P500 in making\u00a0 repairs on the\u00a0 premises which were then absolutely necessary in order to continue his business.\u00a0 He proposed to enter, into a permanent lease, if\u00a0 an agreement could be\u00a0 reached, by\u00a0 which\u00a0 he would obligate himself to\u00a0 make the repairs\u00a0 made necessary by his\u00a0 father's\u00a0 occupancy. They\u00a0 could not\u00a0 agree\u00a0 upon the terms of the permanent lease.\u00a0 The\u00a0 appellee's\u00a0 agent accepted the proposition to enter into a temporary lease for a period of six\u00a0 months, having in mind that the appellant was to make repairs to\u00a0 the extent only of P500.\u00a0 This was the agent's understanding at the\u00a0 time\u00a0 as\u00a0 he demanded in writing the payment of only P1,000, five hundred of which was for lost materials.\u00a0 The appellant\u00a0 did\u00a0 not obligate himself to make the permanent repairs (the repairs made necessary by his father's occupancy).\u00a0 He specifically bound himself to\u00a0 expend in repairs an amount not to exceed P500, and this is the extent of his\u00a0 liability in that regard.<br\/><br\/>The court\u00a0 below found that the appellant had\u00a0 not made any repairs on\u00a0 the premises after the\u00a0 12th day\u00a0 of April, 1907.\u00a0 We can not say\u00a0 that\u00a0 this finding of fact is against the weight of the evidence.<br\/><br\/>The appellant in his letter dated the 7th of October, 1907, said:<br\/><blockquote>\"With regard to the deteriorations which have been caused and the lost materials in the last six months, in the event the contract\u00a0 is\u00a0 not renewed upon terms which I propose to you, I will repair said deteriorations, replacing the\u00a0 lost materials within the\u00a0 period\u00a0 of\u00a0 fifteen days from that on which you\u00a0 notify me\u00a0 that my proposal has been rejected.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>These\u00a0 statements\u00a0 were made by\u00a0 the appellant in said communication more than six months after he executed the temporary\u00a0 lease.\u00a0 Notwithstanding the\u00a0 fact that\u00a0 he called witnesses and attempted to show that he did in fact repair the buildings and expend therefor a sum amounting to P481, we\u00a0 think that such proof is not sufficient to overcome the statements made by the appellant himself.\u00a0 If he had repaired the buildings to this extent and had expended therefor the sum of P481 prior to\u00a0 the date of this\u00a0 communication, it\u00a0 would not have been necessary to make, neither would he have made, this direct and positive promise to make the repairs within fifteen days.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below is hereby modified by reducing the amount found due from defendant to\u00a0 plaintiff to the sum of one\u00a0 thousand pesos, and,\u00a0 so\u00a0 modified,\u00a0 is affirmed.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres,\u00a0 Mapa,<\/i> and <i>Carson, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><\/div>",

The evidence shows\u00a0 also that there existed the aggravating circumstances of nocturnity and <em>morada.<\/em>\u00a0 The crime\u00a0 was committed in the night-time, the defendants evidently selecting that time for the purpose of more effectually committing the robbery.\u00a0 They\u00a0 also entered the house of the offended persons and committed the crime there.\u00a0 There were no extenuating circumstances.<\/p><p>It has been the practice of this\u00a0 court for nearly eight years, under\u00a0 circumstances attending the commission of the crime of <em>robo en cuadrilla<\/em> such as are proven in the present case, to impose the maximum degree of the penalty provided for by law.\u00a0 (U.

that on said day, at about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, she heard an unusual noise in the\u00a0 house occupied\u00a0 by Epifania that, moved by curiosity,\u00a0 she\u00a0 went to see what was going on; that on\u00a0 entering the house she saw the accused consummating\u00a0 the act of sexual intercourse with Epifania; that she observed that Epifania\u00a0 was strenuously objecting to the act and attempting\u00a0 to free\u00a0 herself from the embrace of the accused, but was\u00a0 unable\u00a0 to do so by\u00a0 reason\u00a0 of his superior strength; that she immediately left the house to bring help.<\/p><p>Canuto Aquino testified that on the day in question, at about 4\u00a0 o'clock in the afternoon, he was awakened from slumber\u00a0 by his wife, who stated to him that something extraordinary was occurring in\u00a0 the house occupied by the Abadines; that on going there he found Epifania crying, with her\u00a0 hair disarranged; that just as\u00a0 he arrived at the steps which led into\u00a0 the\u00a0 house the accused came down the stairs leaving the same.<\/p><p>Fabiana Abadier,\u00a0 mother of Epifania, testified that on the morning of the day in question she left Epifania in the house and went away for the day to attend to some work; that\u00a0 on\u00a0 her return in the afternoon Epifania came to\u00a0 her crying and stated to her that\u00a0 the accused\u00a0 had forcibly violated her while the mother was absent.<\/p><p>Telesforo Ejercito, a physician, testified that he examined Epifania some\u00a0 days after the commission\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 crime alleged, and that it was his opinion that she had\u00a0 performed the act of sexual intercourse not long before such examination.\u00a0\u00a0 The cross examination of this witness, however, left his testimony entirely without value to the prosecution.<\/p><p>The accused\u00a0 testified\u00a0 in his\u00a0 own behalf.\u00a0\u00a0 He asserted that on the 24th day of August he was, and for\u00a0 some time prior thereto had been, a partner of the stepfather of Epifania in\u00a0 the manufacture and\u00a0 the\u00a0 purchase and sale of bancas;\u00a0 that he was\u00a0 accustomed to visit the house frequently: that on the\u00a0 day in\u00a0 question at about\u00a0 4 o'clock in the afternoon he went to the house occupied by Epifania, her mother and\u00a0 stepfather, for the purpose of\u00a0 delivering to the latter some money which he had recently received in the course of their business; that finding there only Epifania he placed the money on the table and by means of signs told her to care for it until her stepfather\u00a0 came;\u00a0 that as he was engaged in the act of counting it to be sure\u00a0 that there was no mistake, Epifania, taking\u00a0 a handkerchief, wiped the sweat frdm his face; that while thus engaged Epifania pointed to an open window of the\u00a0 house, through which could be\u00a0 seen Matea Pacheco\u00a0 looking at them\u00a0 from the window of her house; that observing this he arose, borrowed a bolo from the\u00a0 girl and\u00a0 went\u00a0 out of the house leaving her there sweeping the floor; that on descending from the house he cut some bamboo which was growing at the side of the house; that while he was cutting the bamboo the witness Canuto Aquino came to the house and, after looking around awhile, inquired of the accused what he was going to\u00a0 do with the bamboo that he was cutting; that he replied that he was going to repair his house; that thereupon Canuto went\u00a0 away; that after cutting the\u00a0 bamboo and\u00a0 returning the bolo to Epifania, he went home.<\/p><p>The accused also testified that Matea Pacheco did\u00a0 not come to the house while he was there.\u00a0 He also swore that Matea Pacheco had had trouble with his mother and\u00a0 that there was bad feeling between the families\u00a0 by\u00a0 reason\u00a0 of the fact\u00a0 that his mother had compelled Matea\u00a0 to pay a debt which she owed her.\u00a0 The accused denied that he had had sexual intercourse with Epifania on the day in question but stated that by mutual consent such an event had occurred between them some months prior.<\/p><p>The testimony of the accused\u00a0 is supported and corroborated by\u00a0 the\u00a0 testimony of Segundo Lagradilla, Anacleto<\/p><p>Ladiana and Maria Flores.\u00a0 Lagradilla testified that at the time of the commission of the alleged offense he was and for some time prior thereto had been the owner of a piece of land\u00a0 near the\u00a0 house\u00a0 in which the crime is\u00a0 alleged to have been\u00a0 committed; that on the day in question he was mending the fence surrounding\u00a0 said\u00a0 lot; that he saw the accused near the house where Epifania then lived, cutting bamboo\u00a0 with a bolo; that prior\u00a0 to the time when\u00a0 he observed the\u00a0 accused thus\u00a0 engaged he had not heard or noted anything unusual occurring inside the house; that he had been there for some time before the accused went to the house and\u00a0 was there until very late in the afternoon,\u00a0 long after the accused had left the house; that he saw Epifania sweeping the floor while the accused was there and after he had left; that he saw nothing unusual in her appearance; that she acted naturally; that shortly after the accused left the house, Epifania called to the house a young girl\u00a0 named Gore, a sister of the\u00a0 accused, and\u00a0 the two went to the river to wash\u00a0 clothes; that he saw Epifania plainly\u00a0 while she was sweeping the floor and when\u00a0 she\u00a0 passed by him on her way to the\u00a0 river in company with Gore, and that there was nothing\u00a0 unusual in\u00a0 her appearance; that she was not weeping\u00a0 and gave\u00a0 no evidence\u00a0 of having\u00a0 been weeping recently.\u00a0\u00a0 On cross-examination\u00a0 this witness testified\u00a0 that although the\u00a0 accused entered the house,\u00a0 he remained there but a very\u00a0 short time when he came forth with a bolo and began to cut\u00a0 bamboo. This witness also testified that the only person who went to the house at the time the accused was\u00a0 there was the witness Canuto Aquino, and that\u00a0 Matea Pacheco did not approach the house during that\u00a0 time.<\/p><p>The witness Anacleto Ladiana testified that he\u00a0 was present in\u00a0 the\u00a0 barbershop of Matea Pacheco's husband when she had a quarrel with the mother of the accused over the fact that the latter\u00a0 had compelled Matea to pay a\u00a0 debt which she owed her, the said Matea threatening her in the following language:\u00a0 \"You look out, I will pay you, there are other\u00a0 days\u00a0 coming,\"\u00a0 at\u00a0 the same time throwing at her a piece of money\u00a0 which he took to be a peseta.<\/p><p>Maria Flores, mother of the accused, testified that Matea Pacheco was an enemy of hers,\u00a0 having been made such by reason of compelling her to pay a debt which she owed her.<\/p><p>While the witness Canuto Aquino testified that when the accused descended the stairs from the house his appearance was somewhat unusual, nevertheless, when confronted with the testimony which he gave before the justice of the peace on the preliminary examination, which showed that he had therein stated that he carefully observed the accused when he descended from the house and that he appeared as usual, he admitted that what he testified\u00a0 to before the justice of the peace was true.\u00a0 It should also be noticed in connection with the testimony of this witness that\u00a0 although\u00a0 he had been sent to the house\u00a0 by Matea\u00a0 Pacheco, who told\u00a0 him that the accused was forcibly violating Epifania, and\u00a0 that on arriving there he\u00a0 saw her crying and disordered, he yet asked no questions and made no endeavor whatever to investigate\u00a0 the cause of her trouble or to do anything in her behalf.<\/p><p>That the\u00a0 accused went to the\u00a0 house on\u00a0 the\u00a0 afternoon in question to\u00a0 deliver money to the stepfather of Epifania is undisputed.\u00a0\u00a0 That he\u00a0 delivered the money to Epifania to be given by\u00a0 her to her stepfather is also undisputed.\u00a0 That he was in the house but a very short time is uncontradicted. That on leaving the house he borrowed a bolo from Epifania, that he leisurely\u00a0 and in his\u00a0 own time cut the bamboo which\u00a0 he needed to repair his house, that he then returned the bolo into the hands\u00a0 of Epifania, are facts which are admitted by all.\u00a0 These\u00a0 are events as they\u00a0 usually\u00a0 and naturally occur in the ordinary affairs of life when nothing eventful has happened and when no serious crime has been committed.\u00a0 It is\u00a0 entirely improbable that if the accused had just come from forcibly violating Epifania he would calmly borrow a bolo from her and leisurely cut\u00a0 bamboo at the very threshold of the house where the violation had occurred, and would as calmly and quietly return the bolo into the hands of Epifania after the bamboo had been cut. It is highly improbable that a young lady\u00a0 who had just been criminally violated by brute force would still continue to carry out the ordinary relations of friendship with the very man who had been the cause of her degradation.<\/p><p>The testimony of this\u00a0 witness\u00a0 demonstrates, then, that the relations sustained between Epifania and the\u00a0 accused after the alleged violation were those which would naturally be expected between\u00a0 persons who\u00a0 had\u00a0 nothing\u00a0 between them except friendly relations instead of those of violator and violated, and\u00a0 that the appearance and deportment of Epifania after the alleged violation were entirely different from those\u00a0 which would\u00a0 be naturally expected under the circumstances alleged by the prosecution.\u00a0\u00a0 She not only swept\u00a0 the house in the\u00a0 ordinary manner and conducted herself as she ordinarily did, but she also\u00a0 called to her company another young lady, with whom she\u00a0 went to the river to wash clothes, exhibiting no\u00a0 unusual symptoms and showing no unusual treatment.\u00a0 It should be observed also that this witness testified that Matea Pacheco\u00a0 did not go to the house on\u00a0 that afternoon during the time\u00a0 when the accused\u00a0 was there.\u00a0\u00a0 The testimony of\u00a0 this witness strongly corroborates the\u00a0 theory and story of the accused.<\/p><p>It should not be forgotten\u00a0 that there\u00a0 was ill feeling existing between Matea Pacheco and\u00a0 the mother of the accused. That Matea Pacheco was at the time of the trial\u00a0 of this action, and had for some time prior thereto been, an enemy of the mother of the accused is overwhelmingly established by the proofs.<\/p><p>The\u00a0 torn and bloody garments which the\u00a0 prosecution alleged were the result of\u00a0 the forcible violation of Epifania were not presented as\u00a0 evidence on the trial of this\u00a0 action, and the only testimony as to\u00a0 the existence qf such garments is that of the mother of the girl alleged to have been violated.<\/p><p>Upon the whole case there is a clear doubt that the evidence establishes\u00a0 the guilt of the accused.\u00a0 We, therefore, reverse the judgment of\u00a0 the\u00a0 trial court and\u00a0 acquit the accused of the crime charged against him.\u00a0 So ordered.<\/p><p><em> Torres, Mapa, Johnson,<\/em> and<em> Carson,\u00a0 JJ.,<\/em>\u00a0 concur.<\/p><\/div>",

We can not say, after a careful examination of the record, that it is an improper conclusion from the facts presented. It appears from the testimony that the defendant required an educated young German who\u00a0 could read and write German well; who was well taught and thoroughly experienced as a salesman; who could not only make the sales that the usual clerk makes but could also attend to the correspondence of the firm; who was qualified to overlook the invoices and determine the correctness of\u00a0 prices;\u00a0 and who could, when required by the defendant, substantially manage the business; and\u00a0 that the plaintiff met\u00a0 these\u00a0 requirements fully.\u00a0 The defendant is a\u00a0 large dealer in\u00a0 gents' furnishings and other articles, and one\u00a0 who can\u00a0 perform\u00a0 such services as the defendant swears he required of the plaintiff and which the plaintiff\u00a0 actually\u00a0 performed for him is, in our judgment,\u00a0 a skilled\u00a0 laborer,\u00a0 if a laborer at\u00a0 all within the meaning of the Act.<br\/><\/li>\u00a0 <li>The trial court found that, before importing the plaintiff, the defendant had made every\u00a0 reasonable effort to obtain a person in the Philippine Islands sufficiently skilled to occupy the position which the plaintiff took under the contract referred to, and that after\u00a0 such\u00a0 efforts\u00a0 he was unable to find\u00a0 any person unemployed with the qualifications which the plaintiff had, which\u00a0 qualifications were necessary in any person before he could properly fill the position\u00a0 which the\u00a0 plaintiff\u00a0 later\u00a0 occupied.\u00a0\u00a0 We have carefully examined the record upon this question and we can\u00a0 not\u00a0 say that the learned trial\u00a0 court\u00a0 found\u00a0 against the fair preponderance\u00a0 of\u00a0 the evidence.\u00a0 The defendant testified that he had made every\u00a0 effort reasonably possible to obtain in the Philippine\u00a0 Islands a man to occupy the position;\u00a0 that\u00a0 such person was\u00a0 necessary to the proper management of his business; that he had advertised in the newspapers of Manila and\u00a0 had\u00a0 made personal inquiries among business men\u00a0 and had\u00a0 several\u00a0 times visited\u00a0 the German consulate in\u00a0 Manila for\u00a0 the purpose of obtaining the assistance of the German\u00a0 consul in securing a young German competent to fill the position referred to; that such advertisements\u00a0 and inquiries\u00a0 were wholly unproductive. While the documentary proof relative to the advertisements in the newspapers referred to does not show all of the facts above stated, nevertheless, such documentary evidence does not represent all of the proof in the record relating to such advertisements.\u00a0\u00a0 It should be\u00a0 borne in mind that the\u00a0 defendant distinctly states\u00a0 in his testimony <em>that he did make such\u00a0 advertisements<\/em>, although he was able to find only\u00a0 the documentary proofs relating\u00a0 to\u00a0 advertisements\u00a0 for\u00a0 other employees at other times.<br\/><\/li>\u00a0 <li>The learned trial court found that the advertisements and inquiries referred to in the\u00a0 previous paragraph were sufficient, although they\u00a0 covered only the Philippine\u00a0 'Islands.\u00a0 We\u00a0 agree with that conclusion.\u00a0 We do not believe it would be a reasonable interpretation of the law to hold that\u00a0 before a skilled laborer could be imported into\u00a0 the Philippine Islands it would be necessary to search every possession\u00a0 of the United States Government, insular and continental, for an unemployed\u00a0 person\u00a0 qualified to\u00a0 fill\u00a0 the position to which the person imported was intended before such importation could be made.\u00a0 Such construction would make it substantially impossible to\u00a0 comply with the law.<\/li><\/ol><p>The\u00a0 plaintiff\u00a0 presented\u00a0 the following assignment\u00a0 of errors:<\/p><p>\"The\u00a0 court erred:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"(1)\u00a0 In sustaining defendant's demurrer to the original complaint.\u00a0\u00a0 This ruling\u00a0 compelled\u00a0 plaintiff to amend\u00a0 his complaint, and to allege and prove\u00a0 affirmatively that\u00a0 labor of like\u00a0 kind unemployed could be\u00a0 found\u00a0 in this country.

The evidence offered by the plaintiff which was excluded by the court was for the purpose of establishing the fact that at the time he made the contract\u00a0 and\u00a0 at the time he came to this country he was\u00a0 without funds of his own. This evidence could have no\u00a0 material bearing upon\u00a0 the issues\u00a0 except to prove the fact already admitted that\u00a0 the defendant\u00a0 had paid plaintiff's fare and had aided and assisted him\u00a0 to come to this country in violation of law.\u00a0\u00a0 The court below,\u00a0 as well as this court on appeal, has found the fact to be that if the plaintiff had not been a skilled laborer his importation\u00a0 would have\u00a0 fallen within the prohibition of the statute, conceding that he was a member of the class of laborers described in the Act.<\/p><p>The\u00a0 other two errors assigned by the appellant need no attention in\u00a0 particular, they having been resolved in\u00a0 the discussion of the others.<\/p><p>The case has been twice, and on separate occasions, carefully considered\u00a0 by this court and we can see no reason\u00a0 for changing the opinion which we formed upon the\u00a0 first investigation.<\/p><p>The motion for reargument is denied.<\/p><p><em>Torres, Mapa, Johnson,<\/em> and<em> Moreland, JJ.<\/em><br\/><em>Carson, J.,<\/em> dissents.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><hr align=\"left\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><p><sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> Short decision of September 1, 1911, 20 Phil.

It is only\u00a0 the corroboratory circumstantial evidence that is\u00a0 relative,\u00a0 now to one, now to the other of them.<br\/><br\/>As circumstantial evidence, arising\u00a0 from the fact that Dolores Cabalu saw\u00a0 that the two aggressors were dressed in black on the night of the crime, the testimony of Cirilo Lumaquin was taken, who, it\u00a0 appears, affirmed that on that night, Wednesday, May 12, 1909, Simeon Sosa and Hipolito de la Cruz went\u00a0 to\u00a0 her house asking for\u00a0 water and were actually dressed in black, and carried nothing in their hands. But Lumaquin, on being questioned by the fiscal as a witness for the prosecution, stated:<br\/><blockquote>\"Fiscal. Do you know when Roberto Baun died?<br\/><br\/>\"Witness.

He is a\u00a0 lad of apparently nineteen years of age and the substance of his testimony is that\u00a0 Tacon called him to his house Tuesday night and\u00a0 he there found Simeon\u00a0 Sosa and Hipolito\u00a0 de la Cruz, with whom Pedro Tacon was plotting the death of Roberto Baun, for the latter had sold a house and had at the time P900; that Tacon tried to induce witness to join in the plot and told him that he had offered to those two men P30; witness was unable to say whether the money was for both or for each of them; witness refused Tacon's proposition, saying that he did\u00a0 so because he was afraid; that on the night of Wednesday, the very day the deed was committed, Tacon again called him for the purpose of stating that those\u00a0 two men were going to commit the crime and inquiring of him whether he wished to\u00a0 join them, but witness again refused; that he left and the other two men, Sosa and de la Cruz, overtook him on the way and they all went along quite a distance together, without saying a word, until\u00a0 they\u00a0 arrived\u00a0 at\u00a0 a\u00a0 corner when\u00a0 witness\u00a0 continued straight ahead on the road to the school house where he had called a\u00a0 meeting\u00a0 for that night, and the other\u00a0 two men turned in the direction of the house of Roberto Baun; and that, a few moments later, the neighbors of Roberto Baun were in excitement over the latter's death.<br\/><br\/>The foregoing is a summary of the gist of the evidence, but.the testimony given was textually as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Fiscal. Whom did you meet then [Tuesday] in Pedro Tacon's house?<br\/><br\/>\"Witness.\u00a0 I met there, in Pedro Tacon's house,\u00a0 Simeon Sosa and Hipolito de la Cruz.<br\/><br\/>\"Fiscal.

And then what did Tacon say?<br\/><br\/>\"Witness.\u00a0 He said, 'Are you not envious of these two; I pay\u00a0 them P30.'<br\/><br\/>\"Fiscal. P30 to both, or to each of them?<br\/><br\/>\"Witness. I do not know whether it was for both or for each of them.<br\/><br\/>\"Fiscal. Who were those two to whom he referred?<br\/><br\/>''Witness. Simeon Sosa and Hipolito de la Cruz.<br\/><br\/>\"Fiscal.

On Wednesday night did anyone again call you?<br\/><br\/>\"Witness. Yes, sir; the alguacil of the barrio told me that I should go to attend the meeting, but that I should first call at the house of the teniente mayor.<br\/><br\/>\"Fiscal. And when you went to Pedro Tacon's house, whom did you meet there?<br\/><br\/>\"Witness. I again met there Hipolito de la Cruz and Simeon Sosa.<br\/><br\/>\"Fiscal. Did you hear the\u00a0 conversation they then had?<br\/><br\/>\"Witness. I heard their conversation that they would\u00a0 go to make the assault at that hour on account of that money.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Inquiring into the\u00a0 grounds of credibility of such\u00a0 serious charges, the following peculiarities are found in the trial record:<br\/><ol><li>\u00a0The defense itself, on cross-examination, asked:<\/li><\/ol><blockquote>\"And is it true that Tacon said nothing as a\u00a0 preamble before\u00a0 speaking to you about the assault\u00a0 upon the house of Roberto Baun?\"<br\/><\/blockquote>to which the reply was made:<br\/><blockquote>\"He\u00a0 said that he would give us money, but I did not wish to accept and they both accepted.<br\/><br\/>\"DEFENSE. Those were Pedro\u00a0 Tacon's first sentences that night, were they not?<br\/><br\/>\"Witness. To me?<br\/><br\/>\"Defense. Yes, to you.<br\/><br\/>\"Witness. Yes, sir.\u00a0 When he got tired quizzing me,\u00a0 he said to me, 'Are you not envious of this money of these two men, which they were willing to accept?'<br\/><br\/>\"Defense. Did Pedro Tacon invite you on those two nights, Tuesday and Wednesday, to accompany Simeon Sosa and Hipolito de la Cruz for\u00a0 the purpose of making an assault upon Roberto Baun's house?<br\/><br\/>\"Witness. Yes, sir.<br\/><br\/>\"DEFENSE. And did he say that to you in the presence of Sosa and de la Cruz?<br\/><br\/>\"Witness. Yes, sir.<br\/><br\/>\"Defense. Did Pedro Tacon\u00a0 have money in his hand that night for the assault?<br\/><br\/>\"Witness. I\u00a0 saw nothing, because it was dark.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In the testimony given by this witness in the case against Hipolito\u00a0 de\u00a0 la\u00a0 Cruz, on cross-examination,\u00a0 he was\u00a0 asked whether he\u00a0 had heard from a\u00a0 distance of five meters the conversation about Roberto Baun's death, to which he replied that he was not that far away, but was among them.<br\/><blockquote>\"Defense. Were you already there when they talked of that plot?<br\/><br\/>\"Witness. I\u00a0 do not know the beginning of\u00a0 the conversation, but what I heard when I\u00a0 was once there is that they would go to assault Roberto Baun's house.<br\/><br\/>\"DEFENSE. Did Pedro Tacon, while you were there,\u00a0 speak to you of that matter?<br\/><br\/>\"Witness. He did.<br\/><br\/>\"Defense. In the presence of both Hipolito and Simeon?<br\/><br\/>\"Witness. He drew me aside a little from them and told me that, but in\u00a0 a low voice?<br\/><br\/>\"DEFENSE. Did he afterwards again join the three?<br\/><br\/>\"Witness. Yes, sir.<br\/><br\/>\"Defense. And for that reason you heard what they were talking about?<br\/><br\/>\"Witness. Yes, sir.<br\/><br\/>\"Defense. So that you were called by Tacon expressly to hear that?<br\/><br\/>\"Witness. No, sir; but\u00a0 he ordered\u00a0 me to\u00a0 take part in what he ordered Simeon and Hipolito to do.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><ol start=\"2\"><li>\u00a0In view of the insistent refusal, which this witness testified that he maintained, to take part in the commission of the crime, it is natural that fear of an accusation should have\u00a0 been aroused by so\u00a0 many spontaneous expressions unexpectedly revealed to an outsider who must have been scandalized at the coolness with which they plotted'a murder and a robbery, and it would seem that\u00a0 some precaution would have been taken or some dire threats resorted to; it is\u00a0 seen, however, by\u00a0 his\u00a0 testimony\u00a0 given\u00a0 in\u00a0 the case against Hipolito de la Cruz, that\u00a0 what this witness said was that \"when <i>cabezang<\/i> Pedro questioned him and he did not wish\u00a0 to accept\u00a0 he ordered the witness to go to the schoolhouse,\" while in the case against Tacon it has already been seen that he testified that the latter charged him\u00a0 not to reveal to anybody what he had heard and, afterwards, replying on cross-examination, he testified that Sosa and de la Cruz\u00a0 said that, since he\u00a0 did not wish to accompany\u00a0 them, he\u00a0 should not reveal that\u00a0 to anyone\u00a0 \"because Don Pedro might order even him to\u00a0 be killed,\" and\u00a0 those two men warned him in\u00a0 the same\u00a0 terms on Wednesday night when, while he was going to the\u00a0 schoolhouse, they overtook him, saying to him:\u00a0 \"because, if this should come to be known to the people, perhaps eabezang Pedro would also order you to be killed;\" but, on being cross-examined, he replied:<\/li><\/ol><blockquote>\"They\u00a0 said to me, 'If you\u00a0 are unwilling, we should like this not to be known by anybody, because,\u00a0 if anyone should come to know it, we will kill you too.'<br\/><br\/>\"Defense. Why did you\u00a0 not reveal that plot to Baun?<br\/><br\/>\"Witness.

But were you restrained by both of them from Tuesday to Wednesday?<br\/><br\/>\"Witness. At all events,\u00a0 they could hold me because they were two.<br\/><br\/>\"Defense. Were you guarded\u00a0 from\u00a0 Tuesday to Wednesday?<br\/><br\/>\"Witness. No, sir; but if they came to know that, in any case they would have killed me.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>This testimony by itself alone appears not to have borne the necessary conviction\u00a0 to\u00a0 the\u00a0 mind\u00a0 of the sentencing judge, for he gave no credence\u00a0 to it whatever in reference to the\u00a0 remuneration or price which the witness so often affirmed that Tacon offered to Sosa and de la Cruz, which the two latter accepted, a circumstance of the utmost importance as one\u00a0 supporting the alleged\u00a0 inducement, which is not considered to have the requisite force and effect as a cause of crime, when it is merely in the form of advice, except in the case where it consists of an order or an agreement dependent upon an offer or promise capable of producing an excitation of intention\u00a0 and a\u00a0 deliberate\u00a0 proposal in the mind of the agent to lend himself to the commission of the crime which, but for such promise or offer, he would not have committed.\u00a0 Such testimony by Primitivo de Jesus appears to have been weighed with that of Cesareo Supang which latter's, notwithstanding the accumulation of so many details in its rapid and brief narration, makes no reference to price or remuneration, but alleges the conspiracy and the causes leading to it, not the single, sole\u00a0 impelling cause stated by the witness de Jesus, which was\u00a0 utterly inadmissible, and went so far as to show\u00a0 why it was inadmissible by relating a mode of action which had not occurred to the first witness.\u00a0 And Cesareo Supang could\u00a0 not, like Primitivo de Jesus, speak of two days of conspiration, as he was an accidental witness, not one like the former witness\u00a0 who was expressly called four times to be present at that concert twice plotted, always under a\u00a0 shed\u00a0 of\u00a0 the house of\u00a0 the alleged inducer and always in\u00a0 the same manner an$ nearly in the same words,\u00a0 the only ones that were to be uttered in the presence of a witness as being suitable to what was to be proved, - a frugality of words which appears to be naught else but characteristic of this delinquent inducer who, when outside\u00a0 of\u00a0 that shed\u00a0 and as soon as he. chanced to meet another witness behind\u00a0 some bushes, also apprised him of his evil design, in a\u00a0 most\u00a0 brief and rapid account which was neither elicited\u00a0 by constraint nor provoked, but was spontaneous to excess,\u00a0 as may be seen by the following statements:<br\/><br\/>Cesareo Supang is a brother-in-law of Primitivo de Jesus. Both lived in the same house in the barrio of Balincanauay. He\u00a0 also\u00a0 was\u00a0 called, according to his testimony, to the meeting in the schoolhouse on\u00a0 Tuesday night and went to it about an hour after Primitivo de Jesus.<br\/><br\/>\"When I went, - he testified, - to the meeting after supper and while I\u00a0 was going from my house to that\u00a0 meeting, I met Pedro Tacon, Hipolito de la Cruz and Simeon Sosa in the\u00a0 ]ow places of a cane thicket, <i>on the edge of the road<\/i> where one has to pass in coming from my house.\u00a0\u00a0 There is a distance of one braza between this thicket and the street. In passing along the street, those persons could not be seen in the places mentioned, on account of the thicket; but they could be, from the road on which I passed.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Stenographic notes, pp. 44 and 45.)<br\/><br\/>The circumstance of place, in this testimony, is of the utmost importance\u00a0 for the due examination of the facts desired to be proved.\u00a0 In the record there is a rough sketch of the ground,\u00a0 drawn\u00a0 by an officer of the\u00a0 Constabulary. Cesareo Supang's\u00a0 house faces a street without name in the sketch, call it A, and which runs in\u00a0 a straight line to the neighborhood where Roberto Baun's house is situated.\u00a0 The street A is cut by\u00a0 a\u00a0 cross street, call\u00a0 it B, which is crossed by another one, call it C, parallel to A, which\u00a0 runs in a straight line to the schoolhouse\u00a0 where, according to\u00a0 the witnesses\u00a0 for the\u00a0 prosecution, the\u00a0 people of the\u00a0 barrio assembled on the nights of Tuesday and Wednesday.\u00a0 Near the point of intersection of A and B\u00a0 is the cane thicket in which Supang testified he had seen those three men.\u00a0\u00a0 From his house\u00a0 to\u00a0 the thicket there is a trail, continually called a road in Supang's entire testimony, to distinguish it from the street A on which his house is located;\u00a0 so that he does not have to enter this street A to reach\u00a0 the cross street B, for the short cut\u00a0 from his house to\u00a0 this street\u00a0 B lessens the walk or distance.\u00a0 What is\u00a0 of the most importance in all this description is the street A, the road from Supang's house to the street B and the thicket between the road and the street near the point of intersection where it was alleged the three men met.<br\/><br\/>On direct examination:<br\/><blockquote>\"Fiscal. And how near were you able to get to them?<br\/><br\/>\"Witness. Close.<br\/><br\/>\"Fiscal. Within how many <i>varas<\/i>?<br\/><br\/>\"Witness. They were on the side\u00a0 of that road which starts from my house and I should have to pass\u00a0 along that road.\"\u00a0 (Sten. notes, p. 45).<br\/><\/blockquote>On cross-examination:<br\/><blockquote>\"Defense. How many <i>brazas<\/i> away were they from the road?<br\/><br\/>\"Witness. The thicket <i>was\u00a0 on the border of\u00a0 the street<\/i><br\/><br\/>\"Defense.

How far were you from them when you passed in front of them?<br\/><br\/>\"Witness. Less than half a <i>vara.<\/i>\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Sten. notes, p. 51.)<\/blockquote>He previously stated that the three individuals\u00a0 mentioned could not be seen from\u00a0 the street, on account of the thicket that would conceal them; now, being close pressed by the defense, he says\u00a0 that\u00a0 the three men were \"between the street and the thicket,\" so that the thicket would not cover them nor prevent\u00a0 their\u00a0 being seen from the street and they were no longer concealed; they\u00a0 were between the street and the thicket and visible to anyone who should pass along the street A;\u00a0 they had not chosen that position between the road\u00a0 and the street, in\u00a0 sight of a\u00a0 person coming\u00a0 from Supang's house and passing along: that trail or road.\u00a0 This being so, M, according to the direct testimony,\u00a0 the\u00a0 three could not have been seen from the street, on account of the thicket which would have prevented it, it is likewise to be inferred that, were they between the street and the thicket they would not have been visible to a person passing along the road, for the same reason, because of the thicket, which, in this position, would, in the same manner, have prevented It.\u00a0 These premises being established,\u00a0 if they could not be seen,\u00a0 what need was there for Hipolito de la Cruz to call attention to them, inasmuch as it was not easy for them to be seen, owing to the thicket which concealed them?<br\/><blockquote>\"And what did you do, on seeing them?\"\u00a0 the fiscal went on to ask.<br\/><br\/>\"Witness. On\u00a0 arriving in front of\u00a0 them, Hipolito said, 'Uncle, lest Nazario might tell about it at the schoolhouse.'<br\/><br\/>\"Fiscal. But did you hear anything else besides that?<br\/><br\/>\"Witness. Hipolito\u00a0 de la\u00a0 Cruz said to Pedro\u00a0 Tacon, \"Uncle, you had better have a talk with Nazario, lest he may go relating or divulging these things.\"<br\/><br\/>\"Fiscal. And did you hear Pedro Tacon say anything that night?<br\/><br\/>\"Witness. Pedro Tacon said to me, 'When you go\u00a0 about, say nothing\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *.'\"<\/blockquote>Naturally enough, he\u00a0 might tell about that meeting in the thicket, and nothing more; but the witness testified: \"Pedro Tacon said to me, 'When you go about, say nothing,\u00a0 for I am going to order an assault upon <i>cabezang <\/i>Berto Baun'; 'Yes,\u00a0 sir', I\u00a0 replied,\u00a0 'I\u00a0 shall not reveal anything.'\"\u00a0 And as if Pedro Tacon could not keep within himself his wicked purpose,\u00a0 that man, who was going to the meeting to\u00a0 which the residents of Balincanauay had been called by himself, continued to say to the witness, without the latter's showing even so much as curiosity to know anything about the matter, that to which the witriess testified on direct examination:<br\/><blockquote>\"He told me that he\u00a0 [Baun] had money, the price of the house that he had sold\u00a0 to Manuel de Leon for P900, and, furthermore, he\u00a0 said that Teodorica,\u00a0 Baun's daughter-in-law, was trying to get and insisted on getting the land which I hold, and he said: 'If you\u00a0 [witness apparently refers to Sosa and de la Cruz]\u00a0 succeed in entering his house, kill him, don't leave him alive, and then he will no longer be able to testify.' \"\u00a0\u00a0 (Sten. notes, p. 46.)<br\/><\/blockquote>This manner of effecting the assault had not occurred to Primitivo de Jesus with whom, on two occasions, Tacon had been quietly talking,under a shed, on Tuesday and Wednesday ; and yet it was a mode of execution which could have suggested itself to Tacon on Wednesday night, at their second meeting under that shed of his house\u00a0 while\u00a0 he was coolly discussing the commission of the assault with Sosa and de la Cruz, but not on Tuesday,\u00a0 on his\u00a0 chancing to\u00a0 meet a stranger on the way, upon their being, as it were,\u00a0 surprised under the cover, of that thicket and precisely while they were endeavoring to avoid being\u00a0 denounced by that\u00a0 stranger, whose antecedents\u00a0 certainly\u00a0 were very bad, according to the testimony of the\u00a0 clerk of the court, Don Tomas Besa Solitario, who testified that some of his brothers-in-law from Bulacan had gone to Tarlac to look for some carabaos which had been lost by their\u00a0 tenants, among them Supang, and that the animal which the latter had taken away was found in his possession.\u00a0 Such is the man - who was not an intimate friend nor even\u00a0 a friend,\u00a0 but a mere acquaintance, of Tacon, as the latter himself testified - to whom\u00a0 Tacon suddenly\u00a0 disclosed\u00a0 his\u00a0 innermost thoughts in order that there might be another one\u00a0 who should know of his evil designs, which neither\u00a0 that encounter nor any constraint whatever arising from\u00a0 the situation made it in\u00a0 any wise necessary for him to reveal.<br\/><br\/>The foregoing\u00a0 is the\u00a0 testimony given by Supang in the case against Tacon; in that against Hipolito de la Cruz, he testified as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Fiscal. And on the\u00a0 way,\u00a0 while you were going to the schoolhouse that night, did you meet anybody?<br\/><br\/>\"Witness. Yes, sir.<br\/><br\/>\"Fiscal. Whom did you meet?<br\/><br\/>\"Witness.

Yes, sir; on my arriving in front of them, for, in going from my house I had to pass along the road which starts from my house and leads to the place where they were, Hipolito said to Pedro Tacon, 'Uncle, lest Sario may go divulging and circulating\u00a0 the matter at the schoolhouse.'<br\/><br\/>\"Fiscal.

That\u00a0 upon the 16th of March, 1904, the plaintiff received of the defendant as\u00a0 a\u00a0 loan\u00a0 the sum of P408, to guarantee the payment\u00a0 of which sum he mortgaged the following described parcels of land:\u00a0 <\/p><p> \"(<em>a<\/em>)\u00a0 In the <em>sitio<\/em> of Tandayat,\u00a0 municipality of Ayuquitan, with an area of eight <em>gantas<\/em> of shelled corn, planted in coco palms, bounded on the north by land of Crisanto Retes, Matias Rada, and Laurencio Salatandor, on the south by land of Gabina Salatandor, and on the west by that of Cipriano Cines.\u00a0 <\/p><p> \"(<em>b<\/em>)\u00a0 In the <em>sitio<\/em> of Tandayat,\u00a0 municipality of Ayuquitan, with an area of two\u00a0 <em>gantas<\/em> of shelled corn, planted in coco palms, bounded on the north by land of Rufino Cines, on the east by the seashore, on the south by land of Higino Catipay, and on the west by the highway.\u00a0 <\/p><p> \"(<em>c<\/em>)\u00a0 In the <em>sitio<\/em> of Tandayat,\u00a0 municipality of Ayuquitan, with an area of twenty <em>gantas<\/em> of shelled corn, planted in coco palms, bounded on the north by land of Antonio Cid, on the east by\u00a0 the highway, on the south and west by a mangrove swamp.\u00a0 <\/p><p> \"(<em>d<\/em>)\u00a0 In the <em>sitio<\/em> of Tampe, municipality of Ayuquitan, with an area of half a <em>cavan<\/em> of shelled corn, planted in coco palms, bounded on the north by land of Cipriana Belocora, on the east by the seashore, on the south by land of the deceased Marcelino Estorado,\u00a0 and on the west by land of Sinforosa Silay.\u00a0 <\/p><p> \"(<em>e<\/em>)\u00a0 In the <em>sitio<\/em> of Tampe,\u00a0 said municipality of Ayuquitan, with an area of one <em>ganta<\/em>\u00a0 of shelled corn, with coco and buri palsas, bounded on the north by land of Balbino Binondo, on the east by the highway, on the south by (land of)\u00a0 Matea Retes, Venancio Bandoquillo, and\u00a0 Damian Binondo, and on the west by (land of)\u00a0 Geronimo de la Pena.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0\"Third. That the debt and\u00a0 the conditions of\u00a0 the mortgage appear in a simple document, in which it\u00a0 also appears that\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant should gather all of the fruits of said parcels of land as long as the plaintiff failed to satisfy the said\u00a0 debt, provided that the payment should not be made before\u00a0 the expiration of one\u00a0 year\u00a0 nor after\u00a0 four years, with the\u00a0 condition that the plaintiff and defendant should pay in equal parts the taxes due upon the\u00a0 said\u00a0 land until the entire debt should be paid.\"<br\/><\/p><\/blockquote><p>It appears from the evidence adduced\u00a0 during the trial of the cause that the plaintiff on\u00a0 the 24th of February, 1908, went to\u00a0 the house of the\u00a0 defendant for the\u00a0 purpose\u00a0 of paying to the\u00a0 defendant the sum due on the\u00a0 said alleged mortgage, amounting to P408, and that the defendant refused to receive the said sum and to return to\u00a0 the plaintiff the lands in question, which had been given as a guaranty for the payment of said sum.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0It appears also from the record that on or about the 5th of March, 1908, the plaintiff cited the defendant\u00a0 to appear before the justice of the peace\u00a0 of the pueblo of Ayuquitan, for the purpose of making a judicial offer to pay the said indebtedness and to secure the return of the possession of the lands\u00a0 in question.\u00a0 The evidence shows that the plaintiff, in the presence of the justice of the peace\u00a0 and others, offered\u00a0 to pay\u00a0 to the defendant,\u00a0 in cash, the said sum of P408.\u00a0\u00a0 The defendant refuse to accept the said money, whereupon the justice of the peace directed the plaintiff to deposit the said sum\u00a0 with Felipe Remollo, president of the said pueblo, to be held for the benefit of the defendant and to be\u00a0 paid to him any time\u00a0 he might\u00a0 wish to receive it.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>The record\u00a0 also shows that\u00a0 the defendant remained in possession of\u00a0 said\u00a0 land\u00a0 described\u00a0 in the complaint\u00a0 and continued to gather the crops, from the date on which the plaintiff deposited the amount due on the indebtedness between himself arid the defendant, up to the time the action was commenced in the lower court.<\/p><p> The lower court found that the value of the crops gathered by the defendant after the plaintiff had offered to return the money, amounted to P500.\u00a0\u00a0 The money which the\u00a0 plaintiff had deposited\u00a0 by the\u00a0 direction\u00a0 of the justice of the peace in the hands of Felipe\u00a0 Remollo, was still in the possession of the said Remollo at the time of the trial.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>From\u00a0 the\u00a0 record it appears that the\u00a0 plaintiff\u00a0 had done all that he was required to\u00a0 do for the purpose of securing the\u00a0 return of the possession of the land\u00a0 in question and was entitled to the possession of the\u00a0 same from and aftert the date on which he made a legal offer to pay the amount of the indebtedness\u00a0 due the defendant.\u00a0\u00a0 (Lafont <em>vs<\/em>. Pascasio, 5 Phil. Rep., 391.)\u00a0 When a person having the right of repurchase under a contract of <em>pacto de retro<\/em> makes a bona fide offer to repurchase, in accordance with the agreement and tenders the necessary amount of money, he has done all the law requires\u00a0 of him to preserve\u00a0 his right and to entitle him to the possession of the property.\u00a0\u00a0 (Villegas <em>vs.<\/em> Capistrano, 9\u00a0 Phil. Rep., 416;\u00a0 Fructo<em> vs.<\/em> Fuentes, 15 Phil. Rep., 362.)<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>The lower court rendered a judgment\u00a0 against the defendant and in favor of the plaintiff\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 sum\u00a0 of P500, this\u00a0 being the value\u00a0 of the crops\u00a0 harvested by the defendant\u00a0 from the lands\u00a0 in\u00a0 question after\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiff\u00a0 had offered to repurchase the same, together with the return of the possession\u00a0 of the land.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>It appears that the said P408 was\u00a0 still\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 hands of Felipe Remollo at the time\u00a0 of the trial.\u00a0 The defendant has a right to receive from Felipe Remollo the said P408.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>We find nothing in the record\u00a0 that justifies\u00a0 a\u00a0 modification\u00a0 of the conclusions of the lower court.\u00a0 Therefore the judgment of the lower court is hereby affirmed with costs.<\/p><p> <em>Torres, Mapa, Carson<\/em>, and <em>Moreland, JJ.<\/em>, concur.<\/p><\/div>",

S., 371), it will readily be seen that a holding by this court that the decision in the Weems case involves a declaration\u00a0 that the various provisions of the Penal Code prescribing either the penalty of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">cadena perpetua<\/span> or that of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">cadena temporal<\/span> are repugnant to the Philippine Bill of Rights, and that this court is\u00a0 bound thereby, would result in a general jail delivery of all those heretofore convicted\u00a0 of many\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 gravest and most heinous\u00a0 offenses defined and penalized by law; and would be\u00a0 substantially equivalent to a proclamation of amnesty in favor of all those who have heretofore committed such crimes and have not yet been brought to trial, or who may commit them hereafter until such time as the Legislature may be able to reform the Penal Code.<br\/><br\/>Confronted as\u00a0 we\u00a0 are\u00a0 with the\u00a0 knowledge\u00a0 that consequences so far reaching and\u00a0 disastrous must result from a holding favorable to the contention of counsel on this motion,\u00a0 it is manifestly\u00a0 our duty rigidly to restrict\u00a0 the application of the doctrine laid down in the Weems case to cases wherein\u00a0 the ratio decidendi in that case is\u00a0 clearly applicable and\u00a0 to\u00a0 decline to be bound by\u00a0 inferences drawn from observations and comments\u00a0 contained in the opinion in that case which appear to be based upon a misapprehension of\u00a0 facts, or upon assumed facts\u00a0 which do not\u00a0 accord with the facts in the cases brought before us.<br\/><br\/>We may dismiss without much discussion any suggestion that under the doctrine laid down in the Weems case penalties involving imprisonment with or without hard labor, for life, or for a long period of years followed by surveillance of the discharged convict for life, are essentially and inherently cruel and unusual punishments without regard to the crime for which\u00a0 such penalties\u00a0 are\u00a0 prescribed.\u00a0 As\u00a0 we\u00a0 understand the opinion in the Weems case\u00a0 it rests upon the conclusion that the penalty prescribed and imposed in that case was a cruel and unusual one, principally and more especially on the proposition that by relation to the crime of which the defendant was convicted (that is to say\u00a0 the\u00a0 falsification of a public document by a public official)\u00a0 imprisonment for not\u00a0 less than twelve years, followed by surveillance by the authorities of the discharged convict for life, is a penalty so excessive as to justify and require a judicial declaration that the law prescribing it\u00a0 is repugnant\u00a0 to the Philippine Bill of Rights.\u00a0\u00a0 But there is nothing in the decision in that case which would\u00a0 justify the inference that the court was of opinion that imprisonment, with or without hard labor, for life or for\u00a0 a long term of years\u00a0 followed by the life surveillance of the discharged convict, is to\u00a0 be regarded as a cruel and unusual punishment when prescribed for such crimes as treason, parricide, assassination,\u00a0 and other heinous offenses, or even\u00a0 for less\u00a0 grave offenses when these are marked by\u00a0 attendant\u00a0 circumstances\u00a0 which,\u00a0 in the sound discretion of\u00a0 the legislature, justify and necessitate the imposition of extraordinarily harsh penalties to secure their repression.\u00a0\u00a0 On the contrary, the opinion of the court clearly recognizes the legislative power to prescribe such penalties and even the death penalty in proper cases, and disclaims any intention to express anything which would deny the \"wide range\" of\u00a0 power\u00a0 that\u00a0 the legislature\u00a0 possesses to adapt its penal laws to conditions as they exist, and punish the crimes of men according to their forms and frequency.<br\/><br\/>But counsel's\u00a0 main contention as to the invalidity of the code\u00a0 penalties of <i>cadena perpetua <\/i>and <i>cadena temporal<\/i> is based on inferences drawn from comments of the court in the opinion in the Weems case upon the provisions of the Philippine Penal Code which prescribe that\u00a0 convicts sentenced to either\u00a0 of these penalties will be employed at hard and laborious work or tasks\u00a0 (\"se\u00a0 emplearan en trabajos duros y penosos\" and shall always carry a chain at the ankle, hanging from the waist), (\"llevaran siempre una cadena al pie,\u00a0 pendiente de\u00a0 la cintura\").\u00a0 We think,\u00a0 however,\u00a0 that admitting that the comments of the court would justify the inference that it was of opinion that these provisions of the code, <i>as construed by the court,<\/i> prescribe conditions which would render any penalty affected thereby a cruel and\u00a0 unusual punishment,\u00a0 we must, nevertheless, decline to\u00a0 hold ourselves bound by the\u00a0 further\u00a0 inference,\u00a0 not expressly drawn by the court itself, that the penalties of <i>cadena perpetua <\/i>and <i>cadena\u00a0 temporal,<\/i> as prescribed by existing law in these Islands, are inherently and essentially\u00a0 cruel and unusual punishments:<br\/><br\/>First. Because the court in its opinion expressly admitted that it was not\u00a0 fully advised as to the true meaning and effect of these provisions of the Spanish Penal Code, and we are satisfied that,\u00a0 in this regard, it labored under a misapprehension of fact as to certain matters not essential to the decision of the Weems case, but of vital importance in any general discussion\u00a0 of the inherent and essential characteristics of the code penalties of <i>cadena perpetua<\/i> and <i>cadena temporal.<\/i>\u00a0 In the\u00a0 course of the opinion\u00a0 the\u00a0 writer says: \"It\u00a0 may be that even\u00a0 the cruelty of pain is not omitted. He must bear a chain night and day.\u00a0 He is\u00a0 condemned to painful as well as hard labor.\u00a0 What painful\u00a0 labor must mean\u00a0 we have\u00a0 no exact measure.\u00a0\u00a0 It must be something more than\u00a0 hard labor.\u00a0 It may\u00a0 be\u00a0 hard labor\u00a0 pressed\u00a0 to the point of pain.\"\u00a0 But the\u00a0 Spanish\u00a0 original is not accurately or correctly\u00a0 rendered by\u00a0 the\u00a0 words\u00a0 \"hard and painful labor.\"\u00a0 On this point the court was doubtless led into error by the\u00a0 inaccurate and erroneous\u00a0 rendering\u00a0 of the\u00a0 original Spanish\u00a0 in the\u00a0 English\u00a0 translation of the Philippine Penal Code printed\u00a0 at the Government Printing Office\u00a0 at\u00a0 Washington,\u00a0 in June, 1900, for\u00a0 the Division\u00a0 of Customs and Insular Affairs.\u00a0 In this translation the words \"<i>se emplearan en trabajos duros y penosos\"<\/i> were rendered as follows:\u00a0 \"They\u00a0 shall be employed in hard and painful labor.\"\u00a0 In this connection, however,\u00a0 the English\u00a0 word \"painful\"\u00a0 is\u00a0 not\u00a0 synonymous with\u00a0 the\u00a0 Spanish\u00a0 word \"penoso.\"\u00a0 The\u00a0 more usual and important meaning of the Spanish word <i>\"penoso,<\/i>\" as given by both the \"Diccionario de la Lengua Castellana por La Real Academia\u00a0 Espafiola\" and\u00a0 the\u00a0 \"Diccionario\u00a0 Enciclopedico de\u00a0 la\u00a0 Lengua\u00a0 Casteliana,\" is \"<i>trabajoso<\/i>,\"\u00a0 \"<i>que causa pena o cuesta gran dificultad,\"<\/i> (laborious, that which causes hardship or involves great difficulty).\u00a0 While the word\u00a0 <i>pena<\/i>, from\u00a0 which the adjective is\u00a0 derived, is broad enough to include every form of disagreeable\u00a0 sensation, physical as well\u00a0 as\u00a0 mental or spiritual, and thus in some connections it may properly be said\u00a0 to connote\u00a0 either\u00a0 physical or mental pain or distress (<i>dolor<\/i> or<i> pesar<\/i>), in ordinary use it serves as a synonym for the word \"<i>dificultad<\/i>\"\u00a0 (difficulty or hardship)\u00a0 as in the illustrative phrase given by both the\u00a0 above-mentioned dictionaries,\u00a0 <i>\"Con\u00a0 mucha pena he terminado este\u00a0 negocio.\"<\/i> (With much difficulty\u00a0 I have terminated this business or undertaking.)\u00a0 If the idea of actual suffering or pain, either physical or mental, is\u00a0 uppermost in\u00a0 the\u00a0 mind of a writer in Spanish he\u00a0 would tend to the use of\u00a0 the more specific words <i>dolor<\/i> or <i>pesar<\/i>, the tendency in the use of the word <i>pena<\/i> being\u00a0 to express the\u00a0 idea of difficulty\u00a0 or\u00a0 hardship in the broader signification of these words, without emphasizing or even conveying the idea of actual mental suffering or physical pain.\u00a0 A literal rendering into\u00a0 English of the Spanish text would be as\u00a0 follows: \"They shall\u00a0 be employed in hard and laborious labor,\" or \"They shall\u00a0 be employed in hard and laborious\u00a0 tasks.\"\u00a0 A more\u00a0 liberal rendering, which\u00a0 perhaps conveys the meaning more accurately,\u00a0 would be as\u00a0 follows: \"They shall be employed at the hardest class of labor.\"\u00a0 The use of\u00a0 the adjectives <i>\"duros<\/i>\"\u00a0 and \"<i>penosos\"<\/i> qualifying the same word has\u00a0 an intensive effect and marks a distinction between the hardest class of labor which may be required of prisoners convicted of the gravest crimes in the contemplation of the Spanish legislator and the relatively\u00a0 lighter tasks prescribed\u00a0 for less grave offenders.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 words \"duros\" and\u00a0 \"penosos,\" as used in this connection,\u00a0 carry with them\u00a0 no suggestion of physical or mental pain beyond\u00a0 that which is\u00a0 necessarily involved in the performance of enforced hard and laborious tasks by convicts.\u00a0 That this was the construction placed on the language of the code by the Spanish prison authorities prior to the American occupation,\u00a0 and\u00a0 that it is the construction adopted\u00a0 by\u00a0 the executive\u00a0 authorities under the present sovereignty, may be fairly\u00a0 inferred from the general provisions of the prison regulations in force under both administrations and the uniform practice in the penitentiaries in these Islands.<br\/><br\/>The court above also seems to have been of opinion that \"the cruelty of pain\" is involved\u00a0 in the provisions of the code\u00a0 prescribing that\u00a0 those\u00a0 sentenced\u00a0 to\u00a0 <i>cadena<\/i> \"shall always carry a chain at the ankle, hanging from\u00a0 the waist.\" But it must be apparent that while the carrying of a chain in this manner may and undoubtedly does\u00a0 add to the ignominy\u00a0 and degradation of the principal penalty, the question of its painfulness, physical painfulness, must\u00a0 depend\u00a0 on the kind\u00a0 of\u00a0 chain used for this purpose.\u00a0 While the use of chains has fallen into\u00a0 disuse under\u00a0 the\u00a0 American occupation of\u00a0 these Islands,\u00a0 most of the members\u00a0 of this court have seen and handled chains such as were formerly in use in the Spanish prisons, and we\u00a0 do not\u00a0 think that the carrying of a chain of the size and weight and shape of\u00a0 those formerly employed necessarily resulted in the infliction of physical\u00a0 pain.\u00a0 The code did not prescribe\u00a0 the kind\u00a0 of chain\u00a0 to\u00a0 be used, but certainly it could not have been\u00a0 intended that the shape or size or weight of the chain should be\u00a0 such as to\u00a0 impede materially the movements of a convict engaged in hard labor beyond the jail limits.\u00a0\u00a0 The code\u00a0 confers no express\u00a0 authority to inflict\u00a0 physical pain as\u00a0 a\u00a0 necessary part of the\u00a0 penalty of\u00a0 <i>cadena,<\/i>\u00a0 and under the system of judicial supervision of the penal institutions which existed\u00a0 prior to the\u00a0 American\u00a0 occupation\u00a0 of these Islands, a\u00a0 convict upon whom a thoughtless or brutal jailer placed chains capable\u00a0 of inflicting physical pain, would\u00a0 undoubtedly have been entitled to prompt and speedy relief.<br\/><br\/>The cruelty of pain - physical pain - not being necessarily involved in the application of these provisions of the code, it is quite\u00a0 clear that the requirement as to hard labor does not render the code\u00a0 penalties of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">cadena<\/span> inherently\u00a0 and essentially cruel and unusual punishment; and perhaps\u00a0 the same\u00a0 may be\u00a0 said\u00a0 as to the\u00a0 provisions for the carrying of\u00a0 chains\u00a0 by\u00a0 convicts sentenced to <i>cadena,<\/i>\u00a0 since the\u00a0 use of\u00a0 chains,\u00a0 at least\u00a0 as a\u00a0 measure\u00a0 of\u00a0 security, is\u00a0 not\u00a0\u00a0 unknown in the United States.\u00a0 As to this latter proposition, however, we deem it unnecessary to make an\u00a0 express ruling in view\u00a0 of the fact that, as will\u00a0 hereafter be shown, the requirement as to the carrying of chains by\u00a0 these\u00a0 convicts has long since\u00a0 fallen into disuse, and become obsolete.<br\/><br\/>Second.\u00a0 Because the carrying of chains by convicts sentenced to <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">cadena<\/span> has\u00a0 long fallen\u00a0 into\u00a0 disuse, and\u00a0 in fact no\u00a0 such punishment has been inflicted since the earliest days of the military\u00a0 occupation of the Philippines by American troops.<br\/><br\/>We are\u00a0 not definitely\u00a0 informed,\u00a0 nor have we been\u00a0 able to ascertain through official reports or other similar channels open to our investigation, in what manner or by virtue of what authority the penitentiary officials originally adopted the\u00a0 practice of neglecting or declining to comply with\u00a0 the code\u00a0 provisions\u00a0 in\u00a0 this\u00a0 regard.\u00a0 But since the practice originated while\u00a0 these penitentiaries were administered by the military authorities,\u00a0 through officers of the army\u00a0 of occupation duly detailed for that purpose,\u00a0 it may reasonably and fairly be presumed that these officers\u00a0 were duly authorized by the orders under which they\u00a0 were acting thus\u00a0 to disregard the provisions of municipal law which were continued in force in these Islands by the commander of the American forces in his \"military proclamation\" dated Headquarters, Department of the Pacific, August\u00a0 14,\u00a0 1898. Manifestly, no lawful order so to do\u00a0 could at\u00a0 that\u00a0 time have emanated from any other source than the commander of the forces of military occupation who\u00a0 issued that proclamation, his successors in authority or superior authority. An order from the\u00a0 commander of the forces of military occupation directing those charged with the execution of sentences of <i>cadena<\/i> to disregard the provisions of municipal law as to the carrying of chains by prisoners under their charge, had the effect, by necessary implication, of abrogating these provisions or, at least, of\u00a0 suspending them until such order should be\u00a0 lawfully rescinded.\u00a0 No such\u00a0 rescinding order appears\u00a0 to have\u00a0 been issued, and the\u00a0 issuance of such an order has, of\u00a0 course, been prohibited since the\u00a0 time when the constitutional guaranty was extended to these Islands, if we\u00a0 assume\u00a0 that\u00a0 a\u00a0 requirement as to\u00a0 the carrying of chains by convicts sentenced to\u00a0 <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">cadena<\/span> would be in violation of the prohibition against the infliction\u00a0 of\u00a0 cruel and unusual punishments.\u00a0 It seems\u00a0 clear, therefore,\u00a0 that those provisions of\u00a0 the Penal Code prescribing the carrying of chains are not in force\u00a0 at this time and can not in any way affect the validity of the\u00a0 principal penalty of which they at one time\u00a0 formed a part.\u00a0 We think that there can be no doubt that\u00a0 the officer vested with supreme command during the military occupation of these Islands, with authority to issue the above-mentioned proclamation, had authority to issue such prison\u00a0 regulations as he might deem proper; that his order establishing such\u00a0 regulations had\u00a0 all the force of law; and that in so far as such regulations might conflict with any law theretofore in force, these regulations, as the last expression of the will of the military commander, abrogated the conflicting provisions of the prior law continued in force by virtue of his military proclamation.\u00a0 The chief difficulty which\u00a0 has confronted\u00a0 us in arriving at our conclusion is the\u00a0 fact that we have been unable\u00a0 to find any\u00a0 record of the promulgation of an order directing the discontinuance\u00a0 of the\u00a0 use of chains\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 penal\u00a0 institutions of the Islands, although we have been furnished\u00a0 with copies of all the published orders of the various officers\u00a0 in command of the American forces throughout the\u00a0 period of military occupation.\u00a0 But the preservation of the original order, or of written or printed copies of the original order is not vital.\u00a0 As\u00a0 we understand it, the\u00a0 legality, force, and efficacy of the\u00a0 orders of\u00a0 the military commander did not depend on the form\u00a0 in\u00a0 which they were\u00a0 couched;\u00a0 and doubtless an oral order, formally issued and so promulgated as to charge those affected thereby with knowledge of its existence\u00a0 was not less binding upon them and all\u00a0 others concerned than an order in writing would have been.\u00a0 The vital\u00a0 question is\u00a0 whether such\u00a0 order was in\u00a0 fact issued, and\u00a0 under all\u00a0 the circumstances we think that we are justified in concluding that it was.<br\/><br\/>But however this may\u00a0 have\u00a0 been, we do not think\u00a0 that an obsolete\u00a0 provision\u00a0 of the Spanish\u00a0 Penal Code\u00a0 which is not now enforced and has not\u00a0 been\u00a0 enforced\u00a0 since the Islands were brought under the present sovereignty; which was\u00a0 not\u00a0 enforced\u00a0 at the time\u00a0 when\u00a0 the\u00a0 constitutional guaranty against the infliction of cruel and unusual punishments was inserted in the Philippine Bill of Rights; and which there is no\u00a0 lawful authority to\u00a0 require the\u00a0 prison officials to put in force in the future, if the enforcement be held\u00a0 to involve the infliction of a cruel and unusual punishment, should at this late\u00a0 day be given\u00a0 such vital force as to invalidate many of\u00a0 the most important\u00a0 provisions of existing law, and thus impose\u00a0 upon this court\u00a0 the duty of setting at\u00a0 liberty in this\u00a0 community hundreds\u00a0 of\u00a0 the vilest criminals and of proclaiming the immunity of all those who have heretofore\u00a0 been guilty of many\u00a0 of\u00a0 the gravest and most heinous offenses known to the law.<br\/><br\/>We understand that not only has the use of chains been abandoned since the\u00a0 earliest days of the occupation of these Islands\u00a0 by the military forces of\u00a0 the\u00a0 United States,\u00a0 but that, since that time, the treatment of\u00a0 convicts sentenced to <i>cadena<\/i> has not been differentiated by the executive and prison authorities from that\u00a0 of the ordinary convict sentenced to hard\u00a0 labor for a term of years; so that since that time\u00a0 the\u00a0 provisions of\u00a0 the\u00a0 Penal Code prescribing specially harsh conditions and accessory penalties annexed to the principal penalty of imprisonment imposed upon such convicts, have fallen into disuse so far as their enforcement depends upon\u00a0 these authorities.\u00a0 It would\u00a0 seem, therefore, that just\u00a0 as the provision for the use of chains must be deemed to have been abrogated or at least to have become obsolete and unenforceable, so also must all of the provisions of the Penal Code prescribing special conditions and accessory\u00a0 penalties annexed\u00a0 to the principal penalties of <i>cadena<\/i> be held to be abrogated or at least to have become obsolete and unenforceable, in so far as they impose upon the executive or prison authorities a duty to treat convicts sentenced to <i>cadena<\/i>\u00a0 differently from ordinary convicts sentenced to\u00a0 hard labor\u00a0 for a\u00a0 term of years.\u00a0 We do\u00a0 not deem it necessary, however, to pass upon this proposition at this time, partly because our knowledge of the facts does not permit us to lay\u00a0 down the\u00a0 statement of fact upon which it rests with the same degree of certainty as we are enabled through official\u00a0 reports to say that the use of chains has become obsolete; and partly because, for\u00a0 the\u00a0 purposes of a decision on this motion, we\u00a0 do not think a ruling\u00a0 in this regard is necessary.\u00a0 The penalty of <i>cadena temporal<\/i>, even if it be granted that all the code provisions relating thereto are still in force, when imposed upon a convict of the crime of <i>asesinato,<\/i> would\u00a0 not, in our opinion, be a cruel\u00a0 or\u00a0 unusual punishment,\u00a0 unless it is rendered so\u00a0 by the single provision touching\u00a0 the carrying of chains, and as we have shown, this provision has undoubtedly been\u00a0 abrogated or, at least,\u00a0 has long since become obsolete and unenforceable.<br\/><br\/>Nothing which has been said should be understood as an attempt on our part to set up and maintain our opinion against the opinion of that great tribunal which rendered the decision in the\u00a0 Weems case,\u00a0 We accept, as we should accept, the doctrines and principles laid down in that case as of imperative and controlling authority in this jurisdiction,\u00a0 and shall unhesitatingly\u00a0 apply\u00a0 these doctrines and principles in all cases involving the application of the code provisions prescribing the penalty of <i>cadena<\/i> for offenses similar in nature to that for which Weems was convicted. As\u00a0 we\u00a0 understand the reasoning of the opinion\u00a0 in the Weems case, it imperatively declares that a law prescribing the code\u00a0 penalty of\u00a0 <i>cadena <\/i>for an offense as to which there is nothing \"to\u00a0 give character and degree\" other than the seeking of felonious gain is invalid,\u00a0 because\u00a0 it prescribes a penalty so excessive as to justify a judicial declaration that it is a cruel and unusual punishment;\u00a0 and we are satisfied, from the reasoning of the\u00a0 opinion, that the court would have\u00a0 arrived at the same conclusion\u00a0 even if it\u00a0 had been made to appear to it that \"the\u00a0 cruelty of pain\"\u00a0 is not necessarily involved in the\u00a0 provisions\u00a0 touching\u00a0 enforced labor and the\u00a0 wearing of chains or that the\u00a0 treatment to which convicts sentenced to <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">cadena<\/span> may be\u00a0 subjected in no wise\u00a0 differs from that to which prisoners sentenced to imprisonment\u00a0 for\u00a0 a term of years with hard labor are subjected.\u00a0 The motion is, therefore,\u00a0 denied.<br\/><br\/><i> Arellano, C.

Mariano Cui presiding,\u00a0 convicting\u00a0 the appellant\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 crime of malversation of public funds and\u00a0 sentencing him to one\u00a0 year of imprisonment, to the payment of a fine of P38, to return to the justice of the peace of Palo, Leyte, the sum of P2.30, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, to the disqualification provided in section 3 of Act No.\u00a0 1740, and to pay\u00a0 the costs\u00a0 of the\u00a0 trial.<br\/><br\/>L.\u00a0 W.\u00a0 Berry,\u00a0 auditor of the\u00a0 district,\u00a0 testified\u00a0 that on the 10th\u00a0 of\u00a0 April, 1909, he\u00a0 was in\u00a0 Palo,\u00a0 Leyte,\u00a0 for the purpose of investigating certain irregularities alleged to have\u00a0 been committed by the municipal president of said pueblo\u00a0 in\u00a0 relation to certain fines\u00a0 and\u00a0 costs\u00a0 imposed by the justice of the peace of that place.\u00a0\u00a0 In\u00a0 examining previously the records of the justice of the peace the witness had found that certain sums due from\u00a0 the municipal president to the justice of the peace\u00a0 had not been turned over to the\u00a0 latter.\u00a0 In\u00a0 view of this\u00a0 he went immediately\u00a0 to the office of\u00a0 the\u00a0 village president,\u00a0 Carlos H.\u00a0 Acebedo, the accused, and\u00a0 asked him why he had not turned over certain sums collected on behalf of the justice of the\u00a0 peace for which his secretary had\u00a0 given\u00a0 receipts.\u00a0 The\u00a0 appellant answered that he had left the matter\u00a0 of the collection\u00a0 of the costs and fines and the turning over of the same to his secretary,\u00a0 Crisanto\u00a0 P.\u00a0 Urbina.\u00a0\u00a0 Thereupon\u00a0 the witness went\u00a0 to\u00a0 the secretary's desk,\u00a0 which was near that of the accused, and asked him if he had collected any\u00a0 money which he had not turned over to the justice\u00a0 of the peace.\u00a0\u00a0 The secretary appeared to be nervous and was unable to give a satisfactory answer.\u00a0 At first he said that he had already turned over the sums for which he had given receipts, but later\u00a0 said that he had forgotten to do so.\u00a0\u00a0 Upon asking the accused why\u00a0 he had not ordered his secretary to\u00a0 turn over\u00a0 said sums,\u00a0 he replied that\u00a0 he understood\u00a0 that the secretary had already done it.\u00a0 The witness asked the secretary for a list of the sums collected by him. He replied that\u00a0 he had no list\u00a0 other than certain, memoranda which he had indorsed upon the various executions issued by the justice of the peace, which were in his\u00a0 desk.\u00a0 These notes simply\u00a0 expressed the\u00a0 payment\u00a0 of certain\u00a0 sums, which aggregated a total\u00a0 of P50.85.\u00a0 Upon asking\u00a0 both the accused and his secretary as to what 'had been done\u00a0 with this amount, the accused answered that\u00a0 his secretary ought to have\u00a0 it.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 secretary thereupon\u00a0 opened his money box but could find therein only P10.55.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 witness then asked him for the balance\u00a0 and he replied\u00a0 that\u00a0 he would get it from the house.\u00a0 Again asking the accused why he had not turned over those sums immediately\u00a0 after having collected them, calling his attention to the fact that several months before he\u00a0 had spoken to him about the\u00a0 same matter, at which time he had told him that it was his duty always to turn over sums collected\u00a0 as quickly\u00a0 as\u00a0 they were recovered, the accused gave no other explanation than that he had confided the whole matter to his secretary.<br\/><br\/>It appears also from\u00a0 the testimony of this witness that the offices of the village president and the justice of the peace were in the same building.<br\/><br\/>From the testimony of other witnesses and the exhibits, it\u00a0 appears\u00a0 that\u00a0 on the\u00a0 29th day\u00a0 of December, 1908, the accused turned over to the justice of the peace,\u00a0 through his secretary Urbina, certain sums collected\u00a0 since the last accounting, which took\u00a0 place on the 6th day of December of the same year.\u00a0 It was later discovered, however, that on the 3d,\u00a0 8th and 17th of the said\u00a0 month\u00a0 the secretary made certain collections\u00a0 in the name of the accused\u00a0 amounting to P29.90, according to the contents of Exhibits \"B,\" \"E,\"\u00a0 \"F\" and\u00a0 \"H,\" which\u00a0 collections were not included in the sum\u00a0 turned over\u00a0 on the said 29th\u00a0 day of December. Neither were such sums turned over on the 17th of February, 1909, when the\u00a0 next report was made; but they were\u00a0 accounted for to the justice of the peace on the 13th of April, 1909,\u00a0 together with\u00a0 other collections, after the accused had been required by the auditor to turn over all moneys in his hands.<br\/><br\/>It is unquestioned that the appellant was\u00a0 unable to turn over\u00a0 to\u00a0 the justice\u00a0 of the peace\u00a0 the\u00a0 said\u00a0 P29.90, together with certain\u00a0 other sums, making nearly P40,\u00a0 and that he alleged as an excuse that\u00a0 said sums\u00a0 had been collected\u00a0 by his secretary, Crisanto\u00a0 P. Urbina,\u00a0 to whom he had\u00a0 confided their collection and who,\u00a0 he\u00a0 believed,\u00a0 had turned them over to the proper\u00a0 official.\u00a0 From\u00a0 this the learned attorney for\u00a0 the\u00a0 people argues\u00a0 that the accused ntfust\u00a0 necessarily be guilty of the malversation of said sum. We do not think that this conclusion necessarily follows. Under the provisions of the law a person is guilty of malversation of public funds only when he converts\u00a0 them to his own use or to the use of some other person, or when he handles\u00a0 them so negligently as to permit someone else to convert them.\u00a0 In this case it is unquestioned, from the evidence,\u00a0 that the accused\u00a0 did\u00a0 not convert said\u00a0 sums or any portion of them\u00a0 to\u00a0 his\u00a0 own\u00a0 use, nor to the use of any other person.\u00a0 It appears proved beyond question that said sums were converted\u00a0 by his secretary, Crisanto P. Urbina, to his own personal use\u00a0 and^not to the use or benefit of the\u00a0 appellant in this case.\u00a0 That portion of the law which provides that the failure on the part of a person to account for public funds which have come into his hands is prima facie\u00a0 evidence of his guilt does not meet the situation here presented.\u00a0\u00a0 Such presumption simply\u00a0 takes the place of affirmative\u00a0 proofs showing the actual conversion. It obviates the necessity of proving acts of conversion on the part of the accused, a thing almost always extremely difficult to do.\u00a0 Therefore, such presumption stands,\u00a0 making a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">prima facie<\/span> case against the\u00a0 accused only until\u00a0 such time as he rebuts it by\u00a0 proofs showing the contrary.\u00a0 In the case at bar the appellant has presented proofs conclusively showing that\u00a0 such presumption is not applicable in his case, inasmuch as he\u00a0 did not receive the money, never had it in his physical possession, and did\u00a0 not convert the same.\u00a0\u00a0 This court recently convicted the said\u00a0 Crisanto P. Urbina of the crime of\u00a0 estafa for stealing the very\u00a0 sum, or a part thereof, which the appellant in this case is charged with having\u00a0 embezzled.\u00a0\u00a0 No\u00a0 conspiracy between\u00a0 the appellant\u00a0 and his secretary\u00a0 has\u00a0 been\u00a0 shown in this case, nor did such conspiracy appear in the case against Urbina. No guilty knowledge of the theft committed by the secretary was shown on the part of the appellant in this case, nor does it appear that he in any way participated in the fruits of the crime.\u00a0 If the secretary stole the money in question without the knowledge\u00a0 or consent of the appellant and without negligence\u00a0 on his part, then certainly the latter can not be convicted of embezzling the same money or any part thereof.<br\/><br\/>The evidence completely fails in showing that any portion of the money in this case came actually into the\u00a0 hands of the appellant.\u00a0 It fails utterly to establish that he had any knowledge\u00a0 of the peculations of his secretary.\u00a0 It, therefore, fails\u00a0 to demonstrate\u00a0 that he, directly\u00a0 or\u00a0 indirectly, embezzled the money\u00a0 in question or any portion thereof. Nor is it shown that the accused was guilty\u00a0 of\u00a0 negligence or bad faith in leaving the\u00a0 collection and remitting of said sums\u00a0 to his\u00a0 secretary.\u00a0 The fact that the appellant\u00a0 permitted his\u00a0 secretary to make these collections and\u00a0 to turn the sums collected over to the justice of the peace does not constitute\u00a0 such abandonment, fault or negligence as is described and penalized in the law.<br\/><br\/>A person,\u00a0 to\u00a0 be guilty of a crime,\u00a0 must\u00a0 commit that crime\u00a0 himself or he must, in some manner, participate\u00a0 in its\u00a0 commssion or in the fruits thereof.\u00a0 The appellant\u00a0 in this case, so far as appears from the record, has done none of these things.<br\/><br\/>For these reasons the judgment\u00a0 of conviction is hereby reversed and the discharge of the defendant\u00a0 from custody ordered forthwith.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Vicente Nepomuceno\u00a0 presiding,\u00a0 condemning the defendant, Candido Estacio, to two years, four months, and\u00a0 one day of <i>prision correccional<\/i>, to the accessories provided in article 61, to indemnify the offended party in the sum of five hundred pesos, and in case of insolvency to suffer the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment, and to pay the costs, for the crime of attempted rape.<br\/><br\/>The prosecution presented three witnesses, Isabel\u00a0 Artillero, Maria Artillero, and Hermenegildo del Castillo.\u00a0 Aside from the testimony of the defendant himself\u00a0 he\u00a0 presented that of Crisela Agoncillo and Cirila Estacio.<br\/><br\/>Isabel\u00a0 Artillero,\u00a0 the\u00a0 offended party,\u00a0 22 years of age, single, on\u00a0 being\u00a0 asked\u00a0 what took\u00a0 place between her and the defendant on the 29th of September,\u00a0 1909, stated:<br\/><blockquote>\"I\u00a0 had\u00a0 come from harvesting the rice and had drawn near to a tree to rest myself.\u00a0\u00a0 On reaching the foot of the tree Candido Estacio also came up and asked me if I accepted his love.\u00a0\u00a0 I told him\u00a0 that that\u00a0 was no place to talk of the matter and that I\u00a0 had a house where he might come to discuss it.\u00a0 He replied that it was not necessary to go to the house if his love was to be refused, and that he was resolved to kill a person if she did not accept it.\u00a0 At that, as I still refused him, he\u00a0 caught hold of my arm and as a result my clothes were\u00a0 torn and I received several bruises as\u00a0 he tried to lay with me.\u00a0 When I could no longer resist him I commenced to scream whereupon\u00a0 he caught me by the mouth.\u00a0 In spite of this I continued to try to scream, and my sister perceiving me came to the rescue, whereupon the accused ran away.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>She\u00a0 further testified that after the accused escaped she went to the shack about 10 brazas away and assisted her sister in dividing the palay; that there were rice harvesters near or in that immediate vicinity when the trouble occurred; that she was not examined by the doctor until seven days after the occurrence, and that\u00a0 the defendant had been making love to her for about two years prior to the month of September, 1909.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 second witness, Maria Artillero, a sister of the offended party, stated:<br\/><blockquote>\"My sister, Isabel\u00a0 Artillero, and I were on the top of a hill.\u00a0\u00a0 I was on the slope and she\u00a0 on the level part, about 10 brazas away, when I heard a voice that sounded as though the mouth\u00a0 of the person calling was\u00a0 covered.\u00a0 I became frightened and went to my sister whom I found lying on the ground; a man was\u00a0 stretched on top of her and appeared to be trying to hold her down.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>This witness further testified that this crime was\u00a0 committed by the defendant\u00a0 about\u00a0 12\u00a0 o'clock on the 29th of September, 1909; that at that time there were\u00a0 rice harvesters - Crisela\u00a0 Agoncillo and\u00a0 Cirila\u00a0 Estacio - at the foot of the little hill upon the top of which the\u00a0 trouble occurred.<br\/><br\/>Doctor Castillo, the third witness, testified that he exam- ined the offended\u00a0 party and found two contusions on her right arm.\u00a0\u00a0 This witness knew nothing as to\u00a0 the cause of these contusions or bruises.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 defendant, 33 years of age, single, testifying in his own behalf, related what occurred between him and the of- fended party in the following manner:<br\/><blockquote>\"On\u00a0 the 29th\u00a0 of September last\u00a0 they went to the barrio of Walangbalahibo to harvest rice and I followed them.\u00a0 On arriving at the rice field I encountered Maria\u00a0 Artillero; at that moment neither Isabel nor Crisela Agoncillo were there. After a while I went to the harvesting and there found Crisela and Isabel, both lying down.\u00a0\u00a0 After a few moments they both went to the rice field and I accompanied them; on nearing the field Isabel told Crisela to go on ahead; when she had gone on we commenced to talk of Isabel; after our conversation Isabel\u00a0 called to Crisela\u00a0 and said that they would walk on together to the rice field, so I went to the house. About an hour later\u00a0 I followed them to the field where I found Crisela reaping; I went to assist her, and after awhile Isabel\u00a0 came up and\u00a0 called to Crisela; I\u00a0 stood\u00a0 near Isabel talking to her, Crisela meanwhile working at about three brazas away; the ground where we stood was uneven and it happened that as I leaned toward her I fell with her; we got up again and talked for a moment and then we all left, Isabel and Crisela\u00a0 going on ahead to the\u00a0 house.\u00a0\u00a0 A little later the reapers came up and divided the rice among them.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Do you remember going to the house of Isabel on the following day?<br\/><br\/>\"A. Yes, sir.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>This testimony of the defendant is corroborated\u00a0 in every essential\u00a0 detail\u00a0 by that of\u00a0 Crisela Agoncillo\u00a0 and Cirila Estacio who were in that immediate vicinity at the time of the occurrence complained of.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 offended party was 22 years of age.\u00a0 She and the defendant had\u00a0 been\u00a0 lovers for about\u00a0 two years\u00a0 prior to this alleged attempted rape.\u00a0\u00a0 According to the testimony of the prosecution the alleged crime took place\u00a0 in broad daylight\u00a0 and at a\u00a0 place where three people were so\u00a0 near that\u00a0 they could have seen and\u00a0 heard all that\u00a0 happened. The sister of the offended girl was only 10 <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">brazas<\/span> away and the\u00a0 two witnesses for the defense\u00a0 were just at the foot of the little hill.\u00a0 Isabel\u00a0 says\u00a0 that after the defendant made\u00a0 his escape she went to the shack which was only a few yards distant and assisted her sister in dividing the palay and that she was not examined by the doctor\u00a0 until seven days\u00a0 later.\u00a0 The complaint was not\u00a0 presented\u00a0 immediately.\u00a0\u00a0 The defendant was at Isabel's house the next day and\u00a0 conversed with her.\u00a0\u00a0 In\u00a0 the forenoon of the 29th of September, Isabel\u00a0 and\u00a0 the defendant were together for some time, walking and talking as lovers.\u00a0\u00a0 They came together\u00a0 on the\u00a0 hill about\u00a0 12 o'clock\u00a0 and it appears\u00a0 that while there\u00a0 they became very intimate, so much\u00a0 so\u00a0 that the defendant took hold of Isabel and in a friendly scuffle they fell\u00a0 to\u00a0 the\u00a0 ground.\u00a0 They adopted the old custom\u00a0 of courting,\u00a0 \"bundling.\"\u00a0\u00a0 All of these facts and circumstances show that no attempt\u00a0 was made to rape the\u00a0 girl.\u00a0 Such crimes\u00a0 are not ordinarily committed\u00a0 in such places, in the daytime,\u00a0 and practically in\u00a0 the presence\u00a0 of other people. The testimony of Isabel and her sister, taken together\u00a0 with their\u00a0 subsequent\" acts,\u00a0 is\u00a0 so\u00a0 inherently improbable that it can not be believed.<br\/><br\/>For these reasons the\u00a0 judgment must be\u00a0 reversed and the defendant acquitted.\u00a0 Costs <i>de oficio<\/i>.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Arellano, C.
