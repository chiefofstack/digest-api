PHILIPPINE PUBLISHING COMPANY, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>WILLARD, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">On the 14th of June, 1907, Aldecoa &amp; Co., in liquidation, filed in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila a complaint in a civil action against Alejandro S. Macleod and James Macleod.\u00a0 It was alleged therein that Alejandro S. Macleod, being the manager of Aldecoa &amp; Co. and conspiring with Miguel Ossorio, wrongfully used the money of Aldecoa &amp; Co. in the purchase of an interest in the Pasay estate, and as a result of such wrongful use of the money of Aldecoa &amp; Co., Alejandro S. Macleod had obtained a profit of P161,000, which was represented by the stock of the Pasay Estate Company, Limited.\u00a0 The only allegation in regard to James Macleod was to the effect that Alejandro S. Macleod had transferred to him, James Macleod, all of the stock in the Pasay Estate Company, Limited; that this transfer was fraudulent and simulated, and was made in order to defraud Aldecoa &amp; Co. and to prevent it from obtaining the stock.<br\/><br\/>On the afternoon of the 14th of June a reporter of the \"Manila Times\" examined this complaint in the office of the clerk of the court and, the complaint being in Spanish, procured the clerk to translate it to him, in English.\u00a0 This the clerk did, and from the translation thus made by the clerk the reporter made notes of the contents of the complaint.\u00a0 On the afternoon of Friday, June 14, 1907, the \"Manila Times,\" owned by the defendant, published an article in its newspaper which contained the following statement:<br\/><blockquote>\"Sensational charges for recovery alleging collusion, removing money from the vaults of Aldecoa &amp; Co., and charging wrongful entry of the amounts on the books, were made this morning by Aldecoa &amp; Co., in liquidation, against Alejandro Macleod and James Macleod in the Court of First Instance.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>On the morning of June 15 there was published in the \"Manila American,\" a paper also owned by the defendant, an article relating to this case, which contained the following statement:<br\/><blockquote>\"Alejandro Macleod and James Macleod are charged by Aldecoa &amp; Co., in liquidation, in a complaint filed this morning, with fraud, collusion, and removing money from the safe of the company for private purposes.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It will be seen that these statements were not true, so far as James Macleod was concerned.\u00a0 The complaint made no allegations against him of collusion or removing money from the vaults of Aldecoa &amp; Co. or of wrongful entry of amounts in the books of that company.\u00a0 These charges by the complaint were limited to Alejandro Macleod.\u00a0 It was proven at the trial that the plaintiff James F. Macleod was the James Macleod referred to in this complaint and in these articles so published.\u00a0 He wrote a letter on the night of the 14th, which was published on the morning of the 16th in the \"Manila Cablenews,\" in which he referred to the article published in the \"Times\" and stated that it was a lie and was not even substantiated in any way by the tenor of the complaint.\u00a0 The \"Times\" on the afternoon of June 15 published another article relating to the matter, which contained the letter of the plain tin0 published in the \"Cablenews\" of that morning and, among others, the following statement:<br\/><blockquote>\"So far as the complaint is concerned, while published in part yesterday as a matter of court record and so a privileged communication, its being filed in court does not by any means imply that it sustains the truth.\u00a0 Frequently in court complaints serious charges are made with a view to prejudice the case, only later to be neglected or entirely disproved. Pending further action in the case it will be well to suspend judgment.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>On the 17th of June, Aldecoa &amp; Co., in liquidation, filed an amended complaint in the suit, in which it was stated that a mistake had been made in inserting the name of James Macleod as a defendant and asking that the complaint be amended by striking his name out and inserting in lieu thereof the name of William S. Macleod.\u00a0 This was done. On the afternoon of June 17 the \"Times\" published, in a prominent place on the first page of its newspaper, a statement to the effect that this amendment had been made and the reasons therefor.<br\/><br\/>On the 19th of June, plaintiff commenced this action of libel against the defendant for the recovery of P100,000 damages.\u00a0 Judgment was entered in the court below in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of P15,000.\u00a0 Of this sum, P4,000 was allowed for actual damages suffered by the plaintiff by reason of the publication aforesaid; P7,000 for damages to his feelings and reputation, and P4,000 as punitive damages.\u00a0 From this judgment the defendant has appealed.<br\/><br\/>As said by the defendant in its brief, there is very little controversy about the facts in the case.\u00a0 Section 7 of Act No. 277 is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"No reporter, editor, or proprietor of any newspaper is liable to any prosecution for a fair and true report of any judicial, legislative, or other public official proceeding, or of any statement, speech, argument, or debate in the course of the same, except upon proof of malice in making such report, which shall not be implied from the mere fact of publication.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It was held by the court below that the filing of a complaint in a civil action does not constitute a judicial proceeding until some action is taken thereon by the court.\u00a0 Considerable space in the briefs is devoted to a discussion of that question, but it is not necessary to decide it, because it is apparent that the articles published in these newspapers were not a fair and true report of the complaint.\u00a0 The complaint did not charge James Macleod with removing the money from the vaults of Aldecoa &amp; Co. nor did it charge him with making wrongful entry of the amounts in the books of that company.\u00a0 The articles published stated that the complaint did make these charges.\u00a0 It is apparent that in no way can the published articles be said, therefore, to be a fair and true report of the complaint.\u00a0 That they were libelous within the meaning of the definition of \"libel\" found in section 1 of Act No. 277, can not be doubted.\u00a0 For their publication the defendant is responsible unless some excuse therefor is shown.<br\/><br\/>It is claimed that they were published with justifiable motives, and that the defendant is, therefore, not liable by virtue of section 3 of Act No. 277.\u00a0 That section is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"An injurious publication is presumed to have been malicious if no justifiable motive for making it is shown.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The meaning of this section was considered by this court in the case of the United States <i>vs<\/i>. Lerma (2 Phil. Rep., 254).\u00a0 In the case at bar the defendant entirely failed to prove any justifiable motive for the publication.\u00a0 The mere desire of a newspaper to keep the public informed of what is going on in court can not be considered a justifiable motive for making false statements as to what has actually occurred in such courts.\u00a0 With what was said to the contrary in the case of Butler <i>vs<\/i>. News-Leader Co. (104 Va., 1), cited by the appellant in its brief, we can not agree, and it is to be noted moreover that what was there said was entirely outside of the question really decided in that case, because judgment was rendered therein for the defendant on the ground that the article published did not refer to the plaintiff but to another person.<br\/><br\/>The defendant being liable to the plaintiff for damages, the next question is, what damages can the latter recover?\u00a0 Section 11, of Act No. 277 in part is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"In addition to such criminal action, any person libeled as hereinbefore set forth, shall have a right of civil action against the person libeling him for damages sustained by reason of such libel, and the person so libeled shall be entitled to recover in such civil action not only the actual pecuniary damages sustained by him but also damages for injury to his feelings and reputation, and in addition such punitive damages as the court may think will be a just punishment to the libeler and an example to others.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The court below allowed the plaintiff P4,000 actual pecuniary damages.\u00a0 We do not think that the evidence in the case showed that the plaintiff had suffered any damages of this kind.\u00a0 The phrase \"actual pecuniary damages\" found in this law, would probably by considered as equivalent to the phrase \"special damages,\" as that term is defined in the common law of England and America.\u00a0 The phrase \"actual damages,\" is found in the statutes of several of the United States, and in the case of Allen <i>vs<\/i>. Pioneer-Press Company (40 Minn. Rep., 117), the court said that it included \"all injuries pecuniary in their nature which he may have sustained by the libel.\"\u00a0 The nature of such damages is illustrated by the case of Causin <i>vs<\/i>. Ricamora (5 Phil. Rep., 31), where, by reason of the publication of the libel, the plaintiff lost employment as a school-teacher.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff testified that he had relatives in Scotland to whom he sent copies of the paper containing this publication and added;<br\/><blockquote>\"They are persons of means and very religious, and if they should come to know anything concerning me, they might believe that I am not a person worthy to receive a legacy from them.\u00a0 Naturally they may differ in the way they look upon this affair.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>There was no evidence in the case to show that any one of these relatives had in fact disinherited the plaintiff or had failed to bequeath property to him by reason of the publication of these articles.\u00a0 It, therefore, was not proven that he had suffered any pecuniary loss as far as these persons are concerned.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff was and is engaged in the business of a commercial broker.\u00a0 He testified that-<br\/><blockquote>\"The business has for sometime now been much less than it was formerly; I can not attribute it to any particular person; I do not know whether they have withdrawn their confidence from me or not but my business at the present time is much less either by reason of the times being bad or from some other cause.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>He further testified upon this subject as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Q. Be kind enough to tell the court the amount, nature, and income of your business as a broker?-A. Heretofore P20,000 a year.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. What would you say it is now?-A. Much less than heretofore; I have not made my settlement for the last year, but know it was much less than heretofore, some P12,000 at least.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>This is all the evidence there is on this branch of the case, and it is very apparent that it falls far short of proving that the decrease in the plaintiff's business was due to the publication of the libel.\u00a0 As he says himself, he does not know whether it was or not.\u00a0 The judgment for P4,000 pecuniary damages can not be sustained.<br\/><br\/>The appellant devotes considerable space in his brief to the claim that, no actual pecuniary damages having been proven, the plaintiff is entitled to no damages at all.\u00a0 That there is nothing in this point, is apparent from a mere reading of section 11, above quoted.\u00a0 The cases cited by the appellant in support of its contention are cases brought against telegraph companies for failure to deliver messages or for the wrongful transmission thereof, in which it was held that damages for mental suffering alone could not be recovered.\u00a0 These cases have nothing to do with the question here involved.\u00a0 Section 11 expressly allows such damages.\u00a0 Moreover, the general damages which are allowed in actions of libel are not for mental suffering alone, but they are allowed for injury to the standing and reputation of the person libeled and the common law of England and America presumed that such damages existed, without proof thereof, from the mere fact of the publication of the libel.\u00a0 It would seem absurd to say that the plaintiff could recover no damages for the injury to his reputation unless he proved that he had suffered some other special pecuniary damages.<br\/><br\/>The court below also allowed the plaintiff P4,000 as punitive damages.\u00a0 Such damages can not be recovered in every action for libel.\u00a0 The cases in which they can be recovered in the United States are indicated by the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States.\u00a0 The case of the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad Company <i>vs<\/i>. Quigley (21 How., 202), was, like the case at bar, an action for libel.\u00a0 The court below charged the jury in that case that they might give exemplary damages.\u00a0 The Supreme Court held that this instruction was erroneous.\u00a0 The court said, at page 213:<br\/><blockquote>\"In Day against Woodward (13 Howard, 371), this court recognized the power of a jury in certain actions in tort to assess against the tort-feasor punitive or exemplary damages.\u00a0 Whenever the injury complained of has been inflicted maliciously or wantonly, and with circumstances of contumely or indignity, the jury are not limited to the ascertainment of a simple compensation for the wrong committed against the aggrieved person.\u00a0 But the malice spoken of in this rule is not merely the doing of an unlawful or injurious act.\u00a0 The word implies that the act complained of was conceived in the spirit of mischief, or of criminal indifference to civil obligations.\u00a0 Nothing of this kind can be imputed to these defendants.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In the case of Scott <i>vs<\/i>. Donald (105 II. S., 58), the court said, at page 86-<br\/><blockquote>\"Damages have been defined to be the compensation which the law will award for an injury done, and are said to be exemplary and allowable in excess of the actual loss where a tort is aggravated by evil motive, actual malice, deliberate violence or oppression-\"<br\/><\/blockquote>and at page 88, quoting from the case of Day against Woodward, it said:<br\/><blockquote>\"In actions of trespass, where the injury has been wanton and malicious, or gross and outrageous, courts permit juries to add to the measured compensation of the plaintiff which he would have been entitled to recover, had the injury been inflicted without design or intention, something further, by way of punishment or example, which has sometimes been called 'smart money.' \"<br\/><\/blockquote>It is very apparent that the facts proven in the case at bar do not bring it within the rule thus laid down.\u00a0 There was of course the malice implied by law, but there was no proof whatever of any actual malice against the plaintiff, either on the part of the reporter or of the managers of the newspaper.\u00a0 The reporter testified that he did not know who James Macleod was until he saw him in court.\u00a0 It appeared that a relative of the plaintiff was one of the members of the Board of Directors of the defendant company.\u00a0 It seems plain that the false publication was due to an unintentional mistake made by the reporter in believing that the charges contained in the complaint were made against both defendants when in fact they were made against one only.<br\/><br\/>It is true that the paper did not make any formal retraction, nor did it expressly apologize to the plaintiff for its mistake.\u00a0 But, on the other hand, it did not propagate the libel.\u00a0 On the following day it published the letter of the plaintiff in which he stated that the charges against him were not true; it suggested that judgment be withheld until the facts could be ascertained, and later published the facts relating to an amendment of the complaint, which exonerated the plaintiff from the charges formerly made against him.\u00a0 The case is not one for punitive damages.<br\/><br\/>The general damages allowed for injury to the plaintiff's feelings and reputation the court fixed at P7,000.\u00a0 In view of all the circumstances in the case, we think that P5,000 is a reasonable compensation for such injuries.\u00a0 The judgment of the court below is reversed, and judgment is entered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant for the sum of P5,000, with costs of the first instance.\u00a0 No costs will be allowed to either party in this court.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano G.

Sugar, and beginning at a point marked on the map 20 meters before that marked No. 100 north 14' 59\" east, is a straight line which measures 920 meters and ends at point 28K.\u00a0 Said line forms the axis of the road leading to Cavite, and is at the same time the left side of a rectangle 15 meters wide, with an area of 13,800 square meters, and is bounded on the north by land of Rodriguez, on the south and east by the Dalahican cove, and on the west by land owned by the municipality of Noveleta;<br\/><br\/>That Enrique Rodriguez is made a party defendant in this action, he having the right of redemption on the parcel owned by Sidney D. Sugar, because the period of one year fixed by Act No. 190, for the exercise of such right from the date when defendant Sugar bought the parcel of land at sheriff's sale has not yet expired; that the company has, up to the present, been unable to acquire by contract the said parcels from the two mentioned defendants, in view of the high and unreasonable price they are asking for the same;<br\/><br\/>That the assessed value of the parcel owned by Carmen Rodriguez is P5,820, while the parcel owned by Sidney D. Sugar is assessed at P966.<br\/><br\/>That the company needs to commence immediately the work of locating the track for said line but is unable to do so because the defendants\u00a0 who own the parcels of land required by the company object, and delay in the performance of the work would greatly prejudice the company; that the only means to prevent it is the occupation by the company of the two parcels described in paragraph 3 of the complaint, said company offering to deposit the respective assessed value of both parcels, amounting to P6,786, plus 15 per cent of said sum, or a total of P7,804.\u00a0 Therefore, the company, in accordance with the provisions of Acts Nos. 190, 1258, and 1592 of the Philippine Commission, prays the court that the defendants be served with process to appear and answer within a short period of time the complaint filed by it, the court acting\u00a0 in accordance with the power granted it by Act No. 1258; that, upon an answer having been filed the court appoint commissioners to assess the value of the land and the improvements thereon; that a judgment for the condemnation of land be rendered, giving the said company the right of dominion over said parcels of land and any just and equitable relief; and that as a special relief, the company prayed the court that upon the filing of its complaint with the office of the clerk of the court, an order be issued authorizing the company to occupy the parcels of land described in paragraph 3 of its complaint, in accordance with the provisions of Act No. 1510, in order to enable the company to immediately commence the location and construction of the track, the company offering to deposit the sum above-mentioned as a provisional value of the land whose condemnation is sought under the provisions of Act No. 1592.<br\/><br\/>The defendant Jose Iturralde, in his capacity of executor of the late Maria del Carmen Rodriguez, in his answer to the complaint set forth:\u00a0 That he admits the statements contained in paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 8, and 9 of the complaint; that he has nothing to say with respect to paragraphs 4, 7, and 10, because they do not affect his interests; that he enters a denial with reference to paragraphs 5 and 6 of the complaint, and specially denies that he had asked an excessive price for the condemnation of the land owned by said deceased and that he is opposed to the granting of the relief sought in paragraph 11, because it is unnecessary and prejudicial to the interests of the defendants; he also requests the appointment of commissioners to ascertain the value of the parcel of land marked \"A\" on the map as well as the damages that the condemnation proceedings will cause the defendant.<br\/><br\/>By his answer, the other defendant, Sidney D. Sugar, stated: That he admits paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 8, and 9 of the complaint; that he has nothing to say with respect to paragraphs 6 and 10 because they do not affect his interests; that he enters a denial with reference to paragraphs 5 and 7 of the complaint, and also denies that he had asked an excessive price for the condemnation of the parcel of land marked \"B;\" that he also enters a denial with reference to paragraph 4 of the complaint, because Enrique Rodriguez does not possess the right of redemption mentioned therein; that he is opposed to the granting of the relief sought by paragraph 11 on account of its being unnecessary and prejudicial to his interests, and he requests the appointment of commissioners to ascertain the value of parcel B as well as the damages which said condemnation proceedings may cause him.<br\/><br\/>By its order dated December 21, 1907, the lower court appointed the members of the committee charged with the duty of ascertaining the indemnity to be paid for the parcels of land to be condemned, and on March 12, 1908, said committee filed their report of the matter.<br\/><br\/>In an exhaustive consideration of the subject, the report of the commissioners concludes by stating that after a careful study of the matter and all pertinent data they are of the opinion that the land of Carmen Rodriguez, represented by Jose Iturralde, is situated in an inhabited place and as a just and equitable indemnity there should be paid to its owner P1.25 per square meter, and the sum of P13,459.74 for the trees and walls destroyed and damages caused to the portion of the owner's property not condemned; and that the land of Sidney D. Sugar should be paid for at the rate of P0.60 per square meter.<br\/><br\/>On the 25th of the same month, the plaintiff company filed its opposition to the approval of the report of the commissioners, and in view thereof the lower court designated a day and summoned all the parties for the discussion of said report and the opposition filed by the company.\u00a0 The hearing took place on April 14, 1908, and during its course the\" committee exhibited to the court the documentary evidence filed with them by the parties, while the plaintiff presented documentary evidence as to the value of the parcels of land involved, besides the oral evidence adduced by both sides.\u00a0 On April 23 the lower court rendered final judgment in this action and adjudged that defendant Sidney D. Sugar should recover from the plaintiff the sum of P8,280, and the representative of the estate of Maria del Carmen Rodriguez the sum of P30,469.24; it also ordered that the sum of P96 be paid each.of the commissioners, Ramon Magcauas, Jose Vaca, and Ceferino Herrera, for their services\u00a0 during twenty-four days, with the costs against the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>On May 13, 1908, the plaintiff company excepted to said judgment and moved for a new trial, on the ground that said judgment is contrary to law and is not supported by the evidence, and that, furthermore, the findings of fact made therein were manifestly and plainly against the weight of the evidence.\u00a0 The plaintiff company also excepted to any order of the court denying a rehearing in case such were issued.\u00a0 Such order was issued on the 12th of June, 1908, and by virtue of said proceedings the case is before this court by bill of exceptions.<br\/><br\/>On May 9, 1908, counsel for Carmen Rodriguez also excepted to said judgment, and on the 14th of said month moved for a new trial on the ground that the judgment is contrary to law and is not supported by the evidence, and in case that his motion for new trial be denied, he excepted to the ruling denying the motion, which was in fact denied by order of June 12.\u00a0 The corresponding bill of exceptions was prepared and certified and has been forwarded to the office of the clerk of this court.<br\/><br\/>Inasmuch as the report of the commissioners appointed by the lower court to fix the indemnity to be paid for the parcels of land sought to be condemned by the plaintiff, is not in conformity with the provisions of the law in the case and does not comply with the requirements that are necessary to ascertain with correctness and in accordance with the law the amount of the indemnity, this opinion will not deal with the question raised by the appellants in their respective assignments of errors, and will only state the reasons why the report of the commissioners should not have been approved.<br\/><br\/>Section 244 of the Code of Civil Procedure, among others, contains the following provisions:<br\/><blockquote>\"The commissioners shall assess the value of the property taken and used, and shall also assess the consequential damages to the property not taken and deduct from such consequential damages the consequential benefits to be derived by the owners from the public use of the land taken, or from the operation of its franchise by the corporation, or by the carrying on of the business of the corporation or person taking the property:\u00a0 <i>Provided<\/i>, The consequential benefits assessed shall in no case exceed the consequential damage assessed:\u00a0 <i>Provided further<\/i>, That nothing in this section shall be so construed as to deprive the owner of the actual value of his property so taken or used.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The report of the commissioners is lengthy and exhaustive in regard to what has been alleged and proved by the parties with reference to the respective values of the lands to be condemned, the trees and walls destroyed, and the damages caused to their owners; however, said commissioners in their conclusions did not fulfill the requirements provided by the law, for the report does not contain any specific statements fixing in a positive manner the value of the property so condemned, and the consequential damages caused to the portions of the property not taken; they\u00a0 have not stated the consequential benefits, deduced from said damages, to be derived by the owners from the public use of the land taken; or from the operation of the franchise granted, or by the carrying on of the business of the corporation seeking the condemnation of the property.\u00a0 Therefore, in view of these material defects it is improper to approve said report, it being the basis of the judgment appealed from, and for this reason it should be held null and void because the commissioners who presented it have absolutely disregarded the provisions of the law.<br\/><br\/>Considering that, if the report\u00a0 of the commissioners as well as the judgment rendered in condemnation proceedings are purported to secure for the plaintiff the free exercise of the rights recognized and granted to him by the\u00a0 law, and also to secure for the owner of the land condemned a just indemnity therefor, so that\u00a0 the latter shall not be deprived of its just value without the corresponding indemnity, by the filing of a report which is essentially defective, and in order that in the present action the provisions of the law might be complied with and the controversy between the parties might be properly adjusted without injuring their respective rights, it is indispensable that a new trial in\u00a0 the lower court be ordered, that the new commissioners to be appointed may act in accordance with law, and state in their report the points above referred to and those required by sections 243, 244, and 245 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br\/><br\/>For the above given reasons, and in accordance with the provisions\u00a0 of section 246 of the said code, we are of the opinion that the judgment appealed from and the report of the commissioners should be and they are hereby reversed and held to be null and void, and that the case should be remanded to the court from whence it came with a certified copy of this decision.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C J., Mapa, Johnson<\/i>, and <i>Carson, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><i>Willard, J<\/i>., dissents.<br\/><\/div>",

that it was leased to Gregorio Pe\u00f1alosa, and by the latter sublet with the express consent of the owner to the Manila Building and Loan Association; that, by a decree of the Court of Land Registration issued on August 9, 1907, in case No. 2724, the land was registered in the name of Benito Legarda, subject to the incumbrance of the lease contract in favor of the Manila Building and Loan Association, which incumbrance was entered and indorsed on the title deed issued in favor of Benito Legarda in conformity with the said decree, and that in consequence thereof, the right of lease of the said Manila\u00a0 Building and Loan Association became registered.<br\/><br\/>On the 14th of April, 1908, the last decision of the Court of Land Registration was rendered as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"In view of the fact that the building is an accessory, and that, as sworn to in the amended petition at the end of paragraph 1 thereof, the lease of the land on which the building is erected has been entered in the title deed issued to the owner, Benito Legarda, the note that the registrar shall enter in the proper place at the back of the certificate, to the effect that the building erected on the leased portion of the land is the property of the lessee, is\u00a0 sufficient.\u00a0 The findings contained in the judgment of March 3, and in that rendered on the 6th instant are hereby sustained.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The petitioner excepted in due course and form to the foregoing judgment and submitted to this court his bill of exceptions, wherein two causes of error are alleged :<br\/><ol> <li>That the trial court erred in determining that a building of strong materials, situated on land leased from and owned by a person other than\u00a0 the applicant, such land being duly registered subject to applicant's lease, could not be registered under the provisions of the Land Registration Act.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>In dismissing the application.<br\/><\/li><\/ol>In order to support the first assignment of error, the applicant maintains that section 2 of Act No. 496, the Land Registration Act, deals with the entry or registration of land, buildings, interests; according to the applicant the law unites these three words by the conjunction <i>or<\/i>, as meaning that any one of the three things may be registered independently of the others; and, although in a following clause is\u00a0 mentioned \"the land, <i>and<\/i> the buildings <i>and<\/i> improvements,\" <i>the<\/i> use of the article the in order to distinguish and separate \"land\" from \"buildings and improvements\" confirms said interpretation; that section 19 deals with the application for the registration of title without restricting itself to <i>land<\/i>; that in Act No. 627, dealing with military reservations, mention is made of \"lands or buildings, or any interest therein;\" that, while it is true that the word \"buildings\" has been suppressed in Act No. 806, nevertheless, in Act No. 1138, respecting naval reservations \"lands of private ownership, buildings, and interests therein,\" are again mentioned; that the author of the Land Registration Act was well aware that the word \"land\" comprises everything contained thereon, and probably used it for the sake of brevity so as not to repeat the phrase \"land or buildings or an interest therein;\" that, if the Mortgage Law admits the registration of buildings erected on land belonging to another, independently of the land (art. 107, par. 1), Act No. 496, which has the same object and was intended to amplify rather than to restrict the said law, should be understood in the same sense; that Act No. 496 should be interpreted in its literal sense; that said law is a literal copy of the law of Massachusetts on the subject, the language of section 1 of the latter being identical with section 2 of our law,\u00a0 with the very significant exception that while, in the law of Massachussetts, the term \"title to land\" is employed, our law uses the more extensive term \"title to land or buildings or an interest therein;\" that it might be considered that \"the owner of the land has a contingent right at the expiration of the lease, but by reason of the conjunctive provisions of articles 1573 and 487 of the Civil Code, the owner has no contingent interest or other right to the voluntary improvements of the lessee.\"<br\/><br\/>The use that the law makes of the phrase \"land or buildings or an interest therein,\" instead of the single word \"land,\" is no reason for construing the law as authorizing the registration of buildings erected on land belonging to another, separately and independently from the registration of the land.\u00a0 From the fact that, besides \"land,\" \"buildings\" was added, it must not be inferred that it was the intent of the law to allude to buildings belonging to an owner other than the owner of the land.\u00a0 The natural and more logical inference is that since the buildings are an accessory to the land, in first employing the word \"land\" and subsequently the other word \"buildings,\" it was intended to express what was principal and what was accessory, all pertaining to the same owner; this is shown by section 21, the latter part of which contains a form of application reading as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"And I (or we) declare:\u00a0 (1) That I am (or we are) the owner (or owners) in fee simple of a certain parcel of land with the buildings (if any; if not, strike out the words 'with the buildings'), * * * (2) That said land at the last assessment for taxation was assessed at............dollars; and the buildings (if any) at............ dollars.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Section 127 contains several forms of \"deeds, conveyances, mortgages, leases, releases, and discharges affecting lands, whether registered or unregistered.\"<br\/><br\/>Form No. 2, \"deed of land registered under this Act,\" includes the following statement:<br\/><blockquote>\"................. do hereby sell and convey to said.................. and his heirs and assigns that parcel of land, together with all the buildings and improvements thereon, etc.\"<br\/><br\/>Forms Nos. 3 and 4, \"deeds of land not registered, without or with covenants of warranty,\" read:<br\/><br\/>\"................do hereby sell and convey to the said.............., his heirs\u00a0 and assigns, that parcel of land, together with all the <i>buildings<\/i> and improvements thereon, etc.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>And the same formula, \"parcel of land <i>with all the buildings<\/i> and improvements thereon\" is found in the form of deed for the mortgage and lease of land.\u00a0 It may thus be seen that the language of the forms clearly expresses what was the intent of the law in the identical language of section 2 thereof; the natural and logical interpretation of such language of the Land Registration Act of the Philippine Islands being that it authorizes the owner of the land to register together with the land, all the buildings, improvements, or interests that he has therein, but that under no circumstances can registration be applied for separately and independently by the owner of the land and by the owner of the buildings; that is to say, that the land of one person and the building of another erected thereon can have no separate legal existence in the registry as property independent in themselves.\u00a0 Such a theory can not be set up, nor can this court sustain such a doctrine.<br\/><br\/>It is not true that \"under the system of registration of property established by the Mortgage Law, buildings erected on land belonging to another may be registered separately from the land.\u00a0 (See par. 1, art. 107, Mortgage Law.)\"\u00a0 (Brief. 8.)<br\/><blockquote>\"ART. 107.\u00a0 The following are mortgageable, but with such restrictions as are hereinafter expressed:<br\/><br\/>\"1.\u00a0 A building erected on ground belonging to another, which, if mortgaged by the person who constructed it, shall be without prejudice to the right of the owner of the ground, this incumbrance being only secured by the interest which the person who constructed the building has therein.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The article above quoted does not state that the buildings erected on ground belonging to another person may be registered independently of the land; it only says that they may be mortgaged.\u00a0 Because they are mortgageable it is not to be inferred\u00a0 that they can be registered separately from the land of another person whereon they are erected.<br\/><br\/>And even though there has been no question formally presented nor argument advanced as to the registration of a mortgage on a building erected on land owned by another person, title to which land has not been previously registered, it is not considered out of place to state herein the doctrine of certain commentators on the aforesaid Mortgage Law as follows:<br\/><blockquote><i>\"Remarks in connection with the mortgage of a building constructed on a parcel of land belonging to another person.<\/i>-The right to erect a building on a parcel of land is inherent in the title thereto; and inasmuch as it subsists <i>per se<\/i>, whereas the building can not subsist without the land, the latter is considered as principal, and that which is constructed thereon as accessory.<br\/><br\/>\"According to article 359 of the\u00a0 Civil Code, all works on a piece of property are presumed to be made by the owner and at his expense unless the contrary is proven.<br\/><br\/>\"Even in case it were proven he is entitled to appropriate the works upon indemnification, if there was good faith on the part of the person who carried out the work, or to compel the latter to pay him the value of the land.\u00a0 (Art. 361, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>\"He who builds in bad faith shall lose his right to indemnity.\u00a0 (Art. 362.)<br\/><br\/>\"With such precepts, which have in no manner modified the old law, we are positive that No. 1 of article 107 refers only and Exclusively to a building constructed <i>after a contract<\/i> made with the owner of the land wherein the title of the person at whose expense it was built is recognized; said contract must be registered, as otherwise it could not be recorded.<br\/><br\/>\"Inasmuch as on the registration of the contract its conditions shall be stated, and the extent of the right of he who built shall become known, there will be no difficulty in applying the said No. 1 of article 107.\"\u00a0 (Galindo y Escosura, 3 <i>Legislacion Hipotecaria<\/i>,162)<br\/><\/blockquote>Lastly, as a reason for the appeal, it is alleged that he who builds on land belonging to another need not fear any contingent right on the part of the owner of the land at the expiration of the lease, because the provisions of articles 1573 and 487 of the Civil Code do not grant to the owner of the land \"any contingent interest\" or other right to the voluntary improvements of the lessee.<br\/><br\/>Article 1573 only says that \"a lessee shall have, with regard to the useful and voluntary improvements, the same rights which are granted a usufructuary,\" and article 487 provides that \"the usufructuary may make on the property which is the object of the usufruct any improvements, useful or for recreation, which he may deem proper, provided he does not change its form or substance; but he shall have no right to be indemnified therefor.\u00a0 He may, however, remove said improvements, should it be possible to do so without injury to the property.\"<br\/><br\/>At the expiration of the lease the owner of the land has the right, not merely a contingent one but a definite right under the law, to cause the building erected on his estate to be taken down without incurring any obligation whatever, enforcing against the lessee the obligation imposed by article 1561, to return the estate in the same condition in which he received it (unless an agreement was executed prior to the construction of the building.)<br\/><br\/>If the object leased were a house, it is\u00a0 evident that the lessee might effect such improvements for use, recreation or comfort as would not change its form or substance as he deemed fit; he could build a bower or luxurious pavilion more expensive than the house itself, to which, at the expiration of the lease, the owner of the house would have no right whatever, unless the lessee could not remove the same without injury to the house to which it was attached as an improvement, excepting of course the right to cause the same to be demolished so that the house might be returned to him in the same condition that the lessee received it; but not because the lessee could make such improvement, and because the owner of the house did not have any right thereto, could the said bower or pavilion be registered independently of the house, when, without the house to which it was accessory, it could have no juridical status nor any real existence as a <i>piece of property<\/i> independent from the other <i>property<\/i>, to wit, the house to which it was attached.<br\/><blockquote>\"There can be no doubt, with respect to either the usufructuary or the lessee, that they are dealing with something that belongs to another; that the juridical relation maintained by them has a natural term, and that, therefore, when the time comes, they will have no right to allege such absolute and unlimited title to such improvements, as if the same had been made on their own\u00a0 property.\"\u00a0 (Manresa, 10 Civil Code, 595.)<br\/><\/blockquote>In one word, they have no independent possession of the thing that the improvement represents.<br\/><br\/>The importance of <i>superficies<\/i>, compared to freehold, is in many\u00a0 countries great and constantly increasing, and enormous sums of money are raised and collected for the purpose of speculating in the first of these rights; but a leasehold is by no means a <i>superficies<\/i>, and the Philippine Civil Code supplies various forms of contract which provide security for capital so employed or for concerns engaged in the investment of funds.<br\/><br\/>For the reasons above\u00a0 set forth the order appealed from is hereby\u00a0 affirmed with costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa<\/i>, and <i>Carson, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><\/div>",

As security for any obligation that might be contracted by virtue of the said credit, Rosales expressly and specifically mortgaged a piece of property owned by him, consisting of a building lot and a house of mixed materials thereon at No. 464 Calle Real, Malate.<br\/><br\/>Pablo Reyes, in agreement with the manager of said bank, Arthur P. Bullen, and the above-named Rosales, as well as Pantaleona Alonso y San Luis de Rosales, the latter having previously obtained her husband's consent, also in accord with the aforesaid Bullen and Rosales, likewise mortgaged certain property, as follows:  Reyes, his undivided half share in a parcel of land and the improvements thereon situated at No. 255 Calle Nozaleda, and Pantaleona Alonso a piece of rural property, or a parcel of land used for growing rice and grass situated in the barrio of Singalong, within the limits of the city of Manila; the location, boundaries, and other particulars with respect to the mortgaged properties are set forth in the said instrument.<br\/><br\/>By another instrument dated January 17, 1906, executed by Pablo Reyes, the city of Manila, and the said International Bank, a portion of the land described under the letter \"B\" was ceded to the city of Manila for a street, and in exchange therefor the city agreed to convey to Pablo Reyes other adjoining lands.  The International Bank there-upon canceled the mortgage of that portion of the land ceded, and Reyes executed a mortgage in favor of said bank on the land that the city of Manila assigned to him; the realty described in the instrument being thus subject to the said obligation.<br\/><br\/>By the mortgage deed of July 30, 1904, it was agreed that any sum drawn by Rosales under the contract was to bear interest at the rate of 8 per cent per annum until the day of payment; that the property described under the letter \"A\" would respond for the payment of the said credit of P25,000 to the extent of P15,000, the undivided one-half of the property described under letter \"B\" would answer for the sum of P6,500, and that described under letter \"C\" for the sum of P3,500; that in case judicial proceedings were instituted by the creditor against the mortgaged properties, the latter two, marked \"B\" and \"C,\" would respond for P300 and P200, respectively, for interest, costs, and charges, and in the event of a foreclosure of the mortgage the three mortgaged properties should be considered as forming one only, so that if any of them did not bring at the sale the price fixed in the instrument, the difference would be made up from the higher price which might be obtained for the other mortgaged properties; that by virtue of the said contract the International Bank paid out on the 17th of March, 1907, for account of Maximiano Rosales, the sum of P6,857.38, without any part of said amount or interest thereon having ever been refunded or paid; that on the 31st of December, 1906, the International Bank, through its agent, assigned and transferred its credit of P6,857.38 to the plaintiffs herein, George M. Lack and J. L. Davis, with the interest accrued at the rate of 8 per cent per annum, together with the mortgage securing the payment, for which reason the said plaintiffs are the lawful owners of said credit and the mortgage.<br\/><br\/>The said plaintiffs, Lack and Davis, brought an action to foreclose the mortgage because of the failure to pay the said amount.  The case was brought to trial, but the defendant Pantaleona Alonso did not appear, either in her own behalf, or as adminstratrix of the estate of her late husband, Maximiano Rosales; the other defendant, Reyes, appeared.  The trial judge, in view of the allegations of the parties and the evidence offered at the trial of the case, entered judgment on the 14th of August, 1907, sentencing the defendants to pay to the plaintiffs the sum of P6,857.38, with interest thereon at the rate of 8 per cent per annum, from the 17th of March until full payment was made, and in  addition thereto the sum of P500 for costs and expenses of the suit, the total payment of said amounts to be paid into the court on or before the first Monday in October of said year, the first day of the term of court sessions; in default of payment the properties affected by said mortgage were ordered sold at public auction in the manner and under the terms provided by law, in order to satisfy the judgment; provided, however, that only such portion of the property  as might be necessary to cover the amount due, together with the interest, costs, and charges, should be so sold.<br\/><br\/>In view of the fact that the judgment became final, the court below  ordered its execution, and on the 27th of December, 1907, the sheriff of Manila sold the mortgaged properties at public auction.  The property of the late Rosales was sold for P3,500, that of Pantaleona Alonso for P1,010, and that of Pablo Reyes for P3,050.  The sheriff therefore returned the writ of execution on the 8th of January, 1908, and submitted a statement relating the amount of the debt, the interest owing thereon, costs and expenses of the litigation.  These amounted altogether to P9,095.72 which sum, deducted from the proceeds of the sale, P9,560, left a balance of P464.28.<br\/><br\/>On the same date the sheriff reported that as the sale of the property had been approved by the court he applied the proceeds thereof to the payment to the plaintiffs of the sum of P9,095.72 in full satisfaction of the executed judgment, and retained in his possession the balance of P464.28 awaiting further orders from the court.<br\/><br\/>By a writing dated January 22, 1908, Pablo Reyes, the owner of one of the properties sold, filed a motion setting forth that the sheriff, in executing the judgment, without any reason whatever considered the defendants as being obligated <i>in solidum<\/i> instead of being under obligation only to pay each one his share of the judgment, as determined in the document Exhibit \"A\"; that as the petitioner, by reason of the judgment and of the instrument of obligation, Exhibit A, is only  obliged to pay a proportional share, to wit, thirteen-fiftieths of the amount of the debt of P6,857.38, the sum, received by Maximiano Rosales from the International Bank, or the total amount of P2,082.92, composed of 1,782.92, and P300 for interest, costs, and expenses; that, deducting these amounts from the P3,050, proceeds of the sale of his property, the balance of P967.08 should be returned to him and the judgment should be considered as complied with so far as he was concerned; therefore, he prayed that the sheriff be ordered to return to him the said sum of P967.08, as the balance of the sale of his property after deducting the share of the judgment which he was obliged to pay, proceeding as to the rest in accordance with the law.<br\/><br\/>On the 6th of February, 1908, the judge dismissed the motion of the defendant Reyes and ordered that the balance of the proceeds of the sale, P464.28, be distributed prorata among the defendants in proportion to the price obtained at the sale of their respective properties.  Pablo Reyes excepted to the foregoing decision and moved for a new trial on the ground that the decision was not supported by the evidence and was contrary to law; said motion was overruled and excepted to by the petitioner, who in due course presented his bill of exceptions which was approved and forwarded to this court.<br\/><br\/>The other  defendant, Pantaleona Alonso, also excepted to the foregoing decision and presented a bill of exceptions which was likewise approved and submitted to this court; but she has not, however, filed a brief, which latter was done only by the appellant Pablo Reyes.<br\/><br\/>As long as there exists the obligation contracted by the principal debtor, Maximiano Rosales, to pay Lack and Davis, the assignees of the International Bank, the sum of P6,857.38, in addition to the agreed interest, costs, and charges as provided in the final judgment of August 14, 1907, the property of Pablo Reyes and Pantaleona Alonso, expressly mortgaged for the purpose of securing the payment of said sum, are affected <i>in solidum<\/i>, and are therefore directly responsible for the discharge of  the obligations stipulated in the instrument dated July 30, 1904.<br\/><br\/>Pablo Reyes and Pantaleona Alonso are third parties, foreign to the principal obligation, who, in order to insure its fulfillment, mortgaged their respective properties, encumbering them <i>in solidum<\/i> in the same manner as the property of the debtor Maximiano Rosales.  (Art. 1857, last paragraph, and art. 1876, Civil Code; arts. 105 and 122, Mortgage Law.)<br\/><br\/>It was fully proven that Maximiano Rosales was the only person who received the amount which was the subject of the judgment ordering the foreclosure of the said mortgage; and that in order to cover the indebtedness of said Rosales, with the interest thereon, costs, and charges, it was necessary to sell not only the property of the debtor, but also that belonging to the said Reyes and Alonso which<br\/>was expressly mortgaged to secure payment of the plaintiffs' credit; and to this effect by the proceeds of the sale of the properties subject to said credit, all the liabilities of the said Rosales were liquidated.<br\/><br\/>Thus, in view of the character of the obligation, <i>in solidum<\/i>, by which the two properties of the aforesaid Reyes and Alonso were bound, the creditors made proper use of their right in bringing an action for the foreclosure of the mortgage against Rosales and two owners of the properties that did not pertain to the principal debtor, on the ground that all are attachable, and jointly responsible under the terms of the loan.<br\/><br\/>However, after paying the debt, with interest, cost, and charges for collection, the obligation secured by the mortgage was extinguished (arts. 1156 and 1157, Civil Code); consequently, if said obligation, with relation to the creditors was a joint one, after the liabilities contracted in their favor were settled, this character disappeared from the relations between the obligated debtor and the owners of the properties.  (Arts. 1838, 1839, 1844, and 1847, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>When the mortgaged property was sold, any surplus remaining after paying the creditor and the costs and expenses of the proceedings should have been returned to the mortgage debtor or to the person entitled to receive it.  (Sees. 258 and 453, Code of Civil Procedure.)<br\/><br\/>Maximiano Rosales was the only one who, according to the documentary evidence, received the sum of P6,857.38.  This amount not being repaid, he and the said Pablo Reyes and Pantaleona Alonso were sued, and their mortgaged properties were sold at public auction.<br\/><br\/>Considering therefore that Rosales was the principal debtor and the only one who benefited by the said sum, the responsibility which under the agreement rested upon his property was greater, and the contract was fulfilled according to said agreement, and an execution was levied upon the properties of the two persons foreign to the obligation contracted by him, who simply guaranteed it by means of their own  properties.  It is therefore only just that the distribution of the surplus of the proceeds of the sale of the mortgaged properties be restricted to the said Reyes and Alonso, inasmuch as in view of the nature of the obligation secured by the properties of these latter, the proceeds of the sale of Rosales' property should have been entirely applied to cover his various liabilities, and, on this ground, the surplus of the proceeds of the properties given as security by the two other parties should be returned pro rata to them, and in proportion to the respective prices obtained at the sale; neither Rosales nor his heirs are entitled to any portion whatever of such surplus, because, notwithstanding the fact that the three properties were jointly bound to the payment of all the liabilities of the debtor Rosales, it is only just that his indebtedness should be first paid out of the entire proceeds of the sale of his property, and the outstanding balance should then be paid with the proceeds of the sale of the properties pledged as security by Reyes and Alonso, the  third parties, who had nothing at all to do with the loan but only with the payment thereof in ease the property of the debtor was insufficient.  Thus the judge ordered, at the end of the judgment, that only such property as might be necessary to pay the debt, interest, costs, and expenses should be sold.<br\/><br\/>It is impossible to conceive how it could be lawful for a debtor who has not satisfied with his own property the whole of his obligations, and who has occasioned the sale of property belonging to third parties, and part of the value of the latter has been assigned to meet his liabilities, could still be entitled to participate in the surplus of the proceeds of the sale of property given as security for his indebtedness by such third persons, who did not profit by the loan out of which said obligation arose.<br\/><br\/>It should further be borne in mind that if, under article 1838 of the Civil Code Reyes and Alonso have an unquestionable right to demand proportional indemnization from the heirs of the deceased Rosales, with respect to the sums paid to the creditors from the proceeds of the sale of their respective properties, yet against the said right neither the said heirs, nor Rosales if living, would be entitled to claim any portion of the said surplus, because in addition to Rosales having profited by all the money advanced by the bank, his heirs would then profit by the money of Reyes and Alonso; such a proceeding would be opposed to all ideas of justice.<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing, and considering that all the questions set up in the several errors assigned to the judgment appealed from have been herein resolved, it is our opinion that the said judgment should be affirmed, and it is hereby affirmed with the costs against the appellants:  <i>Provided, however<\/i>, That the pro rata distribution of the sum of P464.28, surplus from the sale, shall be made between Pablo Reyes and Pantaleona Alonso only, in the proportion stated in the judgment; no participation in said sum is allowed to the heirs of the deceased debtor, that portion of the judgment, in so far as it concedes to the heirs of Rosales the right to participate in the said funds, being reversed.  So ordered.<br\/><br\/><br\/><i>Mapa, Johnson, Carson<\/i>, and <i>Moreland, JJ<\/i>., concur.<\/div>",

THE INSULAR GOVERNMENT, RESPONDENT AND APPELLEE.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">On the 8th of March, 1904, in accordance with the new Land Registration Act, Juan Iba\u00f1ez de Aldecoa applied for the registration of his title to a parcel of land, 3,375 square meters in extent, situated in the town of Surigao; a plan and technical description of said parcel was attached to his application.<br\/><br\/>After the formalities of the law were complied with, and an opinion of the examiner of titles opposing the request of the applicant, had been rendered, the Attorney-General by a writing dated March 21,1905, objected to the registration applied for, alleging that the land in question was the property of the Government of the United States, and as now under the control of the Insular Government; that the title of ownership issued by the <i>politico-militar<\/i> governor of Surigao, Mindanao, issued on the 19th of June, 1889, to Telesforo Iba\u00f1ez de Aldecoa, antecessor of the petitioner with respect to the land in question, was entirely null and void, for the reason that said grant had not been made in accordance with the laws then in force on the subject, and because the said governor had no authority to make such a grant; he prayed the court below to dismiss the application with costs.<br\/><br\/>As the case stood the applicant, Aldecoa, on the 8th of April, 1905, amended his former petition, and, relying upon the provisions of paragraphs 5 and 6 of section 54 of Act No. 926, alleged that at the time he requested the registration of the land in question, comprised in the plan then submitted the aforesaid Act No. 926 was not yet in force, and as the latter affords better facilities for securing titles to property unprovided with them, as in the case with the land in question, the applicant, availing himself of the benefits granted by the said Act, prayed that the same be applied to the inscription of his land, inasmuch as it was included within paragraphs 5 and 6 of section 64, Chapter VI, thereof, and prayed the court to take into consideration the amendment to his petition.<br\/><br\/>Evidence was adduced by the petitioner at the trial of the case, and on February 2, 1907, the judge of the Court of Land Registration entered his decision in the matter and, in view of the opposition offered by the Insular Government denied the petition without costs, and ordered the cancellation of the entry made of the said property in the record under No. 408, folio 206 of volume 2 of the municipality of Surigao.<br\/><br\/>The applicant excepted to this decision and moved for a new trial;\u00a0 his motion was overruled to which he also excepted and presented the corresponding bill of exceptions which was approved and submitted to this court.<br\/><br\/>The question set up in these proceedings by virtue of the appeal interposed by counsel for Juan Iba\u00f1ez de Aldecoa, is whether or not a parcel of land that is susceptible of being cultivated, and, ceasing to be agricultural land, was converted into a building lot, is subject to the legal provisions in force regarding Government public lands which may be alienated in favor of private individuals or corporations.\u00a0 While from the remote time of the conquest of this Archipelago the occupation or material possession together with the improvement and cultivation for a certain number of years, as fixed by the laws of the Indies, of given portions of\u00a0 vacant Government lands, was the method established by the Government to facilitate the acquisition thereof by private persons, later, by the royal decrees of June 25, l880, and December 26, 1884, the system of composition with the State and that of sales by public auction were instituted as the means for acquiring such lands.<br\/><br\/>In view of the difficulties which prevented the rapid dispatch of the proceedings instituted for this purpose, the royal decree of February 13, 1894, was promulgated, establishing the possessory\u00a0 information as the method of legalizing possession of vacant Crown land, under certain conditions which were set out in said decree.<br\/><br\/>After the change of sovereignty, the Commission enacted Act No. 926, relating to public lands, in accordance with the provisions of sections 13, 14, and 15 of the Act of\u00a0 the Congress of the United States of July 1, 1902, section 54, paragraph 6 of which (Act No. 926) is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"SEC. 54.\u00a0 The\u00a0 following-described persons or their legal successors in right, occupying public lands in the Philippine Islands, or claiming to own any such lands or an interest therein, but whose titles to such lands have not been perfected, may apply to the Court of Land Registration of the Philippine Islands for confirmation of their claims and the issuance of a certificate of title therefor to wit:<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0

*<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"6.\u00a0 All persons who by themselves or their predecessors in interest have been in the open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation of agricultural public lands, as defined by said Act of Congress of July first, nineteen hundred and two, under a bona fide claim of ownership except as against the Government, for a period of ten years next preceding the taking effect of this Act, except when prevented by war or <i>force majeure<\/i>, shall be conclusively presumed to have performed all the conditions essential to a government grant and to have received the same, and shall be entitled to a certificate of title to such land under the provisions of this chapter.<br\/><br\/>\"All applicants for lands under paragraphs one, two, three, four, and five of this section must establish by proper official records or documents that such proceedings as are therein required were taken and the necessary conditions complied with:\u00a0 <i>Provided, however<\/i>, That such requirements shall not apply to the fact of adverse possession.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Given the above legal provisions and the data contained in the record, it is seen that the land, the registration of which is claimed, was of the class of vacant crown or public land which the State could alienate to private persons, and being susceptible of cultivation, since at any time the person in possession desired to convert it into agricultural land he might do so in the same manner that he had made a building lot of it, it undoubtedly falls within the terms of the said Act of Congress, as well as the provisions of the above-cited section 54 and paragraph 6 thereof of Act No. 926, for the reason that the said land is neither mining nor timber land.<br\/><br\/>We refrain from mentioning herein what originally was the nature of the land whereon was built the greatest cities of the world; and confining ourselves to that on which the cities and towns in these Islands were erected, it can not be denied that, at the commencement of the occupation of this Archipelago by the Spaniards, and at the time of the distribution of lands, the latter were rural and agricultural in their nature.\u00a0 Rural also were the old towns, the cradle and foundation of the present cities and large towns of the Philippines, and as the inhabitants increased, and added to the number of their dwellings, the farms gradually became converted into town lots.<br\/><br\/>In provincial towns, and in the suburbs of Manila, many houses are\u00a0 to be seen that are erected on lots that form part of land used for agricultural purposes.\u00a0 If for the time being, and to the advantage of the possessors thereof, they have ceased to be such agricultural lands, they may later on again become transformed into farming land and, by the industry of the owner, again be made to yield fruit.<br\/><br\/>Hence, any parcel of land or building lot is susceptible of cultivation, and may be converted into a field, and planted with all kinds of vegetation; for this reason, where land is not mining or forestal in its nature, it must necessarily be included within the classification of agricultural land, not because it is actually used for the purposes of agriculture, but because it was originally agricultural and may again become so under other circumstances; besides, the Act of Congress contains only three classifications, and makes no special provision with respect to building lots or urban lands that have ceased to be agricultural land.<br\/><br\/>In the decision rendered by this court in the case of Mapa <i>vs<\/i>. The Insular Government, No. 3793 (10 Phil. Rep., 175), the legislation in force was interpreted in a similar sense.<br\/><br\/>It is not to be believed that it was the sense of the two sovereign powers that have successively promulgated the said laws, to place those in possession of building lots under title of ownership\" in an anomalous, uncertain and insecure position, rendering it impossible for them to obtain legal titles to the lands appropriated by them, and denying them the care and protection of the law to which they were certainly entitled on account of the efforts they have made, both in their own behalf, and for the benefit of the cities and towns in which they reside, contributing to the wealth and increase of the country.<br\/><br\/>In the case at bar we have to deal with laws that were enacted after almost all the towns of this Archipelago were established, and it must be assumed that the lawmakers have started from the supposition that titles to the building lots within the confines of such towns had been duly acquired; therefore, in special cases like the present one, wherein is sought the registration of a lot situated within a town created and acknowledged administratively, it is proper to apply thereto the laws in force and classify it as agricultural land, inasmuch as it was agricultural prior to its conversion into a building lot, and is subject at any time to further rotation and cultivation; moreover, it does not appear that it was ever mining or forest land.<br\/><br\/>It should be noted that article 1 of the royal decree and regulation of the 25th of June, 1880,-says:\u00a0 \"In the Philippine Islands, all vacant lands, soils, and grounds without a lawful private owner, or, which have never been under private control, shall be deemed to be alienable crown lands for the effects of the regulation, and in accordance with law 14, title 12, book 4, of the <i>Novisima Recopilacion<\/i>;\" that article 1 of the royal decree of the 14th of February, 1894, states:\u00a0 \"Vacant lands, soils, grounds, and mountains in the Philippine Islands shall be deemed to be alienable Crown lands, provided they are not included within the following exceptions:\u00a0 (1) Those of private ownership; (2) those belonging to the forest zone; (3) those comprised in the communal laws, or within zones reserved for the use in common by residents of the community; and (4) those lands which are susceptible of\u00a0 private appropriation by means of composition or possessory information;\" and that although section 13 of the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902, directs the Government of the Philippine Islands to classify public lands that are neither forest nor mining lands according to their agricultural character and productiveness, section 14 authorizes and empowers the said Government \"to enact rules and regulations and to prescribe terms and conditions to enable persons to perfect their title to public lands in said Islands, who, prior to the transfer of sovereignty from Spain to the United States, had fulfilled\u00a0 ll or some of the conditions required by the Spanish laws and royal decrees of the Kingdom of Spain for the acquisition of legal title thereto, yet failed to secure conveyance of title, etc.;\" and section 15 authorizes and empowers the said Government of the Philippine Islands \"on such terms as it may prescribe, by general legislation, to provide for the granting, or sale and conveyance to\u00a0 actual, occupants and settlers and other citizens of said Islands such parts and portions of the public domain, other than\u00a0 timber and mineral lands, of the\u00a0 United States in said Islands, as it\u00a0 may deem wise, etc.\"<br\/><br\/>From the language of the foregoing provisions of the law, it is deduced that, with the exception of those comprised within the mineral and timber zone, all lands owned by the State or by the sovereign nation are public in\u00a0 character, and <i>per se<\/i> alienable and, provided they are not destined to the use of the public in general or reserved by the Government in accordance with law, they may be acquired by any private or juridical person; and considering their origin and primitive state and the general uses to which they were accorded, they are called agricultural lands, urban lands or building lots being included in this classification for the purpose of distinguishing rural and urban estates from mineral and timber lands; the transformation they may have undergone is no obstacle to such classification as the possessors thereof may again convert them into rural estates.<br\/><br\/>If the land sought to be registered is neither mineral nor timber land, and on the other hand is susceptible of cultivation the Act of Congress contains no provision whatever that would exclude it from being classified as agricultural land, and assuming that it falls within that classification, the benefits of paragraph 6, section 54, of Act No. 926, must forthwith be applied for the reason that it has been fully proven that the applicant was in possession thereof for more than 13 years prior to the 26th of July, 1904, when the said Act went into effect.\u00a0 Furthermore, there is no legal reason or cause to exclude urban lands from the benefits of the aforesaid Act; on the contrary, the interpretation that urban real estate, that is not mineral or forestal in character, be understood to fall within the classification of agricultural land, is deemed to be most rational and beneficial to public interests.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, in view of the foregoing, it is our opinion that the judgment appealed from should be reversed, and that it should be, as it is, hereby ordered, that, after holding in general default all such persons as may have any interest in the said parcel of land, the registration of the same shall be granted in accordance with the Land Registration Act.\u00a0 No special ruling is made as to costs.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Willard, J<\/i>., concurs.<br\/><i>Carson, J<\/i>., concurs in the result.<br\/><br\/><br\/><hr align=\"center\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><br\/>ARELLANO, C J., with whom concurs MAPA, J., concurring:<br\/><br\/>The land that is the subject of the petition in this case, is described in the judgment of the court below, whose conclusions of fact are of the following tenor:<br\/><blockquote>\"The object of registration in this case is a lot situated on McKinley Avenue, in the municipality of Surigao, province of the same name;\u00a0 it comprises an area of 3,375\u00a0 square meters, and is bounded on the north by the seashore; on the east by the land of the heirs of the late Andres Ojeda; on the south by the aforesaid street; and on the west by the premises of the government building.<br\/><br\/>\"In order to acquire the said property, which is a building lot situated in the inhabited portion of the said municipality of Surigao, Telesforo Iba\u00f1ez de Aldecoa on June 11, 1889, filed a petition with the <i>politico-militar<\/i> governor of the 3d District of Mindanao to whom then belonged the municipality and Province of Surigao, claiming the said lot as being abandoned, and requesting that he be granted a title of ownership thereto.\u00a0 In view of the said petition, D. Juan Cirlot y Butler, major of Infantry, who at the time was governor, directed <i>bandillos<\/i> (proclamations) to be published for three successive nights in the said municipality of Surigao, calling on all persons who considered that they were entitled to the said lot; after the <i>bandillos<\/i> had so been published, and no one appearing to claim the lot, and it appearing from the report of the <i>gobernadorcillo<\/i> and <i>principales<\/i> of said municipality that the lot was unoccupied and that no one had ever been known to own the same, the governor, on the 19th of the said month of June, granted to the said Telesforo Iba\u00f1ez de Aldecoa title of ownership to the said lot in order that he might forthwith build a house thereon.\u00a0 The document setting forth the said concession was a certificate issued on the same date, the 19th, by the aforesaid governor; and by order of the Court of First Instance of Surigao, the same was entered in the record of public instruments of the said court corresponding to said year on the 22d of October.\u00a0 A certified copy of the document so recorded was obtained and attached to the record of the case, and was recorded on the 23d of March, 1896, in the registry of property of the said Province of Surigao at folio 206 of volume 2 of the municipality of Surigao, lot No; 408, first entry.<br\/><br\/>\"After the title of ownership to the lot in question had been granted in the manner above stated, the grantee, Telesforo Iba\u00f1ez de Aldecoa, immediately took possession and within a short time had it fenced in and took care to keep the fence in good repair; and thus keeping the land constantly fenced in he continued to possess it publicly, in his own name and as the owner thereof, without any interruption or opposition from anyone until he died in the year 1902.<br\/><br\/>\"After the death of the said Telesforo Iba\u00f1ez de Aldecoa, his widow succeeded him in the possession of one-half of the lot im question for the reason that it pertained to the <i>bienes gananciales<\/i> (property acquired during marriage), and his son, the petitioner herein, as sole heir of the deceased, inherited the other half.\u00a0 He also has kept the land fenced in, and lately replaced the fence with a\u00a0 wire one.\u00a0 Toward the month of March or April, 1903, the provincial board of Surigao, in spite of the opposition and protests on the part of the aforesaid possessors, ordered the removal of and did remove the fence around the lot above referred to, claiming that the said lot belonged to the Province of Surigao; that for this reason their possession was interrupted until March 1904, when the said possessors, after having filed their application for registration in these proceedings, erected monuments on the lot.\u00a0 And that lot has never been devoted to cultivation, neither is it by its nature suitable for any kind of cultivation<br\/><br\/>\"Such are the facts that should be considered as proven in these proceedings.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>From the facts set forth it evidently appears:<br\/><br\/>First.\u00a0 That the land in question is a building lot situated within the inhabited portion of the town of Surigao.<br\/><br\/>Second.\u00a0 That since June, 1889, the said lot had been possessed with the knowledge and consent of the said municipality,peacefully and without any opposition up to March or April, 1903, to-wit, approximately fourteen years; that prior to the said adjudication, the <i>gobernadorcillo<\/i> and the <i>principales<\/i> of said municipality had been cited and heard on the subject.<br\/><br\/>Third.\u00a0 That the title of ownership issued by the provincial official of Surigao was entered in the registry of property of said province on the 23d of March, 1896.<br\/><br\/>Fourth.\u00a0 That from March or April, 1903, until March, 1904, the material possession suffered interruption on account of an abusive and arbitrary act of intrusion\u00a0 of the provincial board of Surigao which had absolutely no authority to commit such an act of spoliation; and,<br\/><br\/>Fifth.\u00a0 That in March, 3,904, after the peaceful and quiet possession was resumed, the petitioner instituted these proceedings for the purpose of obtaining a new title of ownership in accordance with the Acts of the Philippine Commission that created the new registry of property.<br\/><br\/>The present opposition is based on the supposition that the said lot was a parcel of land subject to composition, as if it were vacant Government land; that as such vacant and Government land, it had not been duly granted by composition when in June, 1889, Telesforo Iba\u00f1ez de Aldecoa obtained his title of ownership from the <i>politico-militar<\/i> governor of said province, who was not the person called upon to grant titles by composition after the promulgation of the royal decree of June 25, 1880, and that of December 26, 1884; and the Court of Land Registration, assuming on the contrary that the said land is not vacant crown land, it not being devoted to agriculture but to building purposes, and because \"by reason of its nature it is not suitable for agriculture but is destined exclusively to building purposes, and is therefore not agricultural, it believes that the same can not be the subject of adjudication under the provisions of the Act of Congress and Act No. 926 of the Philippine Commission, and that in the opinion of the court, paragraph 6 of section 54 of Act No. 926 is not applicable to urban real estate.\"<br\/><br\/>An established rule which has been repeatedly laid down by this court, is that only the vacant Crown lands were subject to composition; that is, rural lands devoted to cultivation.\u00a0 In the present case the petitioner finds himself between the horns of a dilemma:\u00a0 As to whether the land in question is urban or rural property; if it is rural, the Attorney-General argues that it has not been subjected to composition, and that the possession thereof is consequently illegal; and if it is urban, the lower court rejects it as not being susceptible of acquisition under the title of ownership that has been newly created and organized.\u00a0 In conclusion it appears:\u00a0 First, that the owners of urban real estate can not obtain Torrens titles through possession for ten years, nor by a possessory information recorded for that or a longer period of time.\u00a0 Second, that urban real estate, possessed for more than fourteen years with the knowledge and consent of the authorities of the town wherein it is located, may be recovered by the Government on the ground that it is public land that had not been alienated by it, for the reason that it is not agricultural, nor is it mineral or timber land.<br\/><br\/>It would be necessary to demonstrate that this building lot, which was recorded in the registry of property with possessory information, and continuously and materially possessed as private property since June, 1889, until the 11th of April, 1899, without opposition from the Spanish Government, was public land transferred by the treaty of Paris to the public domain of the present sovereignty, and that under said character of public land it is not agricultural land that may be conveyed to private dominion according to section 13 of the Act of Congress, and section 54 of Act No. 926.<br\/><br\/>It is true that at the time above referred to, June of 1889, the <i>politico-militar<\/i> governor of Surigao had no authority to issue titles by composition.\u00a0 And as a matter of fact, at that time, the said governor did not issue to Telesforo Iba\u00f1ez de Aldecoa a title by composition.\u00a0 So that this is not the question.<br\/><br\/>What he did was to adjudicate to Telesforo Iba\u00f1ez de Aldecoa a building lot in the town of Surigao, and to that effect he issued to him a title of ownership to the said lot.\u00a0 And this is a question anent which absolutely no argument has been made in the whole proceedings.<br\/><br\/>It is argued that the said provincial governor had no authority to issue the title, and that the said title is null on the unwarranted supposition, that it was a title of composition such as was provided for by the royal decrees of 1880 and 1884, which is entirely incorrect.<br\/><br\/>What should have been proven was, either that the said lot, though a building or town site (not rural property or arable land) could not be acquired otherwise than by composition, in accordance with the aforesaid royal decrees of 1880 and 1884, or, that the <i>politico-militar<\/i> governor of a province could not adjudicate the ownership of land situated within the town to a resident thereof as such building lot or urban real estate, and still less as vacant.\u00a0 Crown land, although within the inhabited portion of the town, as it is desired to consider the same.\u00a0 And in this sense nothing has been proven or sought to be proven in the whole case.<br\/><br\/>The question is merely one of supposition.\u00a0 The Attorney-General has supposed that it was vacant Crown land, and as such, agricultural land which was possessed without title by composition.\u00a0 The court below has supposed it to be a building lot\u00a0 or urban property, not agricultural land, entirely excluded from the benefits of Act No. 926 of the Commission.\u00a0 And in either form the said land or building lot possessed as private property prior to the enactment of Act No. 926, can not be recorded in the new registry of property.<br\/><br\/>Was it an illegal possession?\u00a0 Was the possession held from 1889 to the 11th of April, 1899, usurped from the Spanish\u00a0 Government so that at the latter date, the land thus possessed should be considered as part of the public property which Spain transferred to the United States by the treaty of Paris?<br\/><br\/>According to Article VIII of said treaty, Spain ceded all real property which under the law was of public domain, and as such belonged to Spain.\u00a0 It was held that this cession could in no way affect the ownership or rights which, in accordance with law, corresponded to the <i>peaceful possessor<\/i> of property of every class, that is to say, the property of private individuals.<br\/><br\/>Ever since the year 1889, the land in question has been owned by a private individual, and was not public property belonging to the Spanish Government.\u00a0 It was possessed as such, and in order to deprive it of this status it was necessary that the Spanish Government or its assignee should recover possession of the same by due process of law.\u00a0 And in order to recover\u00a0 it, it would be necessary to prove that the said lot, which formed a part of the inhabited portion of Surigao, belonged to the Spanish Government on the 11th of April, 1899.\u00a0 This has not been advanced by the opposition; recovery of possession has not been sought, but the title adjudicated in 1889 is repudiated on the ground that the provincial governor of Surigao had no authority to adjudicate it to the said private individual.<br\/><br\/>But, from the enforcement of the Laws of the Indies, provincial governors were authorized to organize towns and distribute land for building purposes. Law 1, title 12, book 4, of the <i>Recopilacion<\/i> of the Laws of the Indies, reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"It is our will that there\u00a0 shall be distributed to all those who shall go out to people the new territories, houses, <i>building lots<\/i>, lands <i>peonias<\/i> and <i>caballerias<\/i> in the towns and places which may be assigned to them by the <i>governor<\/i> of the new settlement * * *.\u00a0 After selecting the territory, province and locality where the new community is to be founded, and after ascertaining the conveniences and resources that may exist thereon, the <i>governor<\/i> within whose district the same is located shall announce whether it is to be a city, town or village.\u00a0 * * *\u00a0 (Law 2, title 8<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> of the same book.)<br\/><br\/>\"First let there be set aside whatever land may be necessary for <i>solares<\/i> (building\u00a0 lots) for the people, commons, and abundant pastures whereon the cattle owned by the residents may graze, and as much again for the use of the natives; the rest of the territory shall be divided into four parts, one of them, which he may select, shall be for the person who is obliged to form the town, and the other three parts shall be distributed among the settlers in equal parts.\u00a0 (Law 7 of the same title and book.)<sup style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">(1)<\/sup>\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Law 8 provides as to how temples shall be constructed:\u00a0 \"Somewhat distant from the <i>plaza<\/i>, where it will be separated from any other building not necessary for its use or adornment.\"\u00a0 * * *.\u00a0 \"Building lots being assigned near it but not in continuation, for the erection\u00a0 of <i>casas reales<\/i> (government buildings) and booths in the <i>plaza<\/i> for public use\u00a0 * * *\" it seems that the lot in question in the case at bar is contiguous to the government building or <i>casa real<\/i> of Surigao,<br\/><br\/>Law 14 of the same title 7, book 4, is a fundamental law which, as a complement to the foregoing organic laws of towns, provides for the separation of the land constituting the inhabited portion of the town from land properly called <i>vacant (baldios)<\/i>, of which so much is spoken in these land registration cases.\u00a0 It reads as follows :<br\/><blockquote>\"Sufficient land having been set aside for the town common, and to allow for the growth of the town as already provided, let all persons authorized to discover and establish new townships indicate pasture lands adjoining the common in order that work cattle, horses, and cattle for slaughtering purposes, together with other cattle which by ordinance the settlers are bound to have, may graze thereon, together with an additional amount, all of which shall be the property of the council, and the balance shall be farm lands to be drawn by lot; there shall be as many of the latter as there are building lots in the township; and if there should be irrigated lands, they shall likewise be divided and\u00a0 distributed by lot in the same proportion among the original settlers.\u00a0 <i>All other lands are to remain vacan<\/i>t in order that we may grant them to new settlers.\u00a0 From said lands the viceroys shall reserve such as they may think advisable to assign to towns unprovided with any, to assist them to pay the salaries of their mayors; they shall provide commons and sufficient pasture grounds, as provided by law, and they shall act accordingly.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Building lots are not vacant lands, and the building lots used to be distributed and adjudicated by the governor of the province or district to which the town belonged, after hearing the <i>gobernadorcillo<\/i> and the notables of such town.\u00a0 As urban property, building lots forming part of the inhabited portion of a town, passed beyond the sphere of the administrative laws to enter that of the civil law.\u00a0 Thus, all questions arising in connection with them, after they had been ceded or granted, could only be decided by the civil law, even though raised by the Government, through action brought before the ordinary courts of justice, and not before the administration, nor the contentious tribunals which the Government itself had established in its relations with persons under its administration, as has already been held by this\u00a0 court in the case of Roura <i>vs<\/i>. The Insular Government (8 Phil. Rep., 214).<br\/><br\/>Vacant lands were those which remained at the disposition of the King or of the supreme government at the capital of the nation after due assignment and distribution of what was needed for the newly formed town; such vacant lands were adjudicated by sale or by composition, or in the form of free grants to new settlers.<br\/><br\/>We can not affirm the reason given for denying the title of ownership applied for in this case, that the subject of the petition was a building lot, which, not being agricultural land was not entitled to the\u00a0 benefits of section 54 of Act No. 926.<br\/><br\/>Paragraph 6 of section 54, which determines the persons who may obtain confirmation of their rights, reads:\u00a0 \"All persons who by themselves or their predecessors in interest have been in the open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation of agricultural public lands, as defined by said Act of Congress of July 1, 1902,\" and what are agricultural lands as defined by the said Act of Congress has already been declared by this court (Mapa <i>vs<\/i>. The Insular Government, 10 Phil. Rep., 175).<br\/><br\/>On this ground the confirmation and title applied for herein should be granted.<br\/><br\/><br\/><hr align=\"left\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> Law 2, title 7, book 4.<br\/><br\/><sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">(1)<\/sup> Law\u00a0 7, title 7, book 4.<br\/><\/div>",

JOSE TAN SUNCO ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>MORELAND, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">This is an action to set aside four judgments rendered by a justice of the peace of the city of Manila upon the ground that they were procured by collusion and fraud, to the injury and damage of the plaintiff. <p>The court below, after hearing the evidence offered upon the trial, found against the plaintiff and rendered a judgment in favor of the defendant dismissing the plaintiff's complaint, with costs.<\/p> <p>The plaintiff did not make a motion for a new trial in the court below and this court can not, therefore, look into the evidence but must confine itself to the facts stated in the opinion of the court below for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not the judgment of that court can be sustained.<\/p> <p>It appears from the opinion of the court below that Tan Sunco was a surety for Chung Chu Sing for the payment by the latter of the purchase price of certain merchandise purchased by said Chung Chu Sing of Ed. A. Keller &amp; Co.; that the time within which said merchandise was to be paid for under the terms of its purchase had expired long before said four judgments were obtained, and that the debt remained unpaid; that the total debt was composed of four invoices of varying amounts\u2014P395.50, P450, P565, and P320.20; that an action had been commenced against the said debtor, Chung Chu Sing, by the present plaintiff for the recovery of the indebtedness due it; that shorly before judgment was secured in that action the said Tan Sunco began four separate actions against the said debtor upon the said invoices in the court of the justice of the peace of the city of Manila; that soon thereafter the said Sunco and the said debtor appeared before said court, and the said debtor then and there confessed judgment in favor of said Tan Sunco in each one of said actions, Tan Sunco thereby obtaining against the said debtor four separate judgments; that immediately upon the recovery of said judgments the plaintiff in those actions, Sunco, caused to be levied thereunder executions upon all of the property of said debtor, which property was not more than sufficient to pay the judgments under which the levies were made; that thereupon the action at bar was begun and the sales under said executions were enjoined pending the determination thereof. These are the admitted facts.<\/p> <p>The plaintiff in this action contends that said four judgments ought to be set wholly aside on account of their having been obtained, as he claims, by collusion and fraud, because the debtor did not owe anything to Sunco at the time the four judgments were secured, basing that contention on the fact, which is admitted, that Sunco had not yet paid the sums for which he had become surety and in connection with which he obtained the judgments.<\/p> <p>We think that article 1843 of the Civil Code is applicable to this case. In their purposes articles 1838 and 1843 are quite distinct, although in perfect harmony, the latter making more clearly effective the purpose of the former. Article 1838 provides for the enforcement of the rights of the surety against the debtor after he has paid the debt. Article 1843 provides for his protection before he has paid but after he has become liable to do so. The one gives a right of action after payment, the other a protective remedy before payment. (Supreme court of Spain, March 22, 1901.) The one is a substantive right, the other of the nature of a preliminary remedy. The one gives a right of action which, without the provisions of the other, might be worthless. The remedy given in article 1843 purposes to obtain for the surety \"relief from the burden of his suretyship or a guaranty to defend him against any proceedings of the creditor and from the danger of insolvency of the debtor.\" (Last paragraph of art. 1843.) Article 1838, speaking strictly, has no such purpose. When the surety's rights under this article become available, he is past the point where a preliminary protective remedy is of any value to him.<\/p> <p>It being evident that the purpose of article 1843 is to give to the surety a remedy in anticipation of the payment of the debt, which debt, being due, he could be called upon to pay at any time, it remains only to say, in this connection, that the only procedure known under our present practice to enforce that right is by action. (Manresa, Civil Code, vol. 12, p. 320.) The defendant Sunco availed himself of that right against the debtor. The methods employed by him to realize his end were unusual but not of themselves fraudulent. We agree with the trial court that the evidence adduced is entirely insufficient to establish such fraud and collusion as would justify a decision setting aside the judgments assailed. (Arts. 1291, 1297, Civil Code; Pe\u00f1a <em>vs<\/em>. Mitchell, 9 Phil. Rep., 587; Jones <em>vs<\/em>. Brittan, 13 Fed. Cas., No. 7455; Oberly <em>vs<\/em>. Oberly, 190 Pa. St., 341; Caldwell <em>vs<\/em>. Fifield, 24 N. J. L., 150.) The facts stated in the opinion of the court below abundantly justify the conclusion.<\/p> <p>But while the surety has the right to obtain as he did the judgments against the principal debtor, he ought not to be allowed to realize on said judgments to the point of actual collection of the same until he has satisfied or caused to be satisfied the obligation the payment of which he assures. Otherwise, a great opportunity for collusion and improper practices between the surety and his principal would be offered which might result to the injury and prejudice of the creditor who holds the claim against them.<\/p> <p>The judgment of the court below is, therefore, affirmed, with costs against the appellant. But the said Sunco shall not execute said judgments against the property of the judgment debtor until he has paid the debt for which he stands surety. So ordered.<\/p> <p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson, Carson,<\/em> and <em>Elliott, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<\/p><\/div>",

S. <i>vs.<\/i> Larion, 2 Phil. Rep., 476; sentences of the supreme court of Spain, January 26, 1877; November 15, 1895; July 13, 1897), of nocturnity and the commission of the offense in a deserted place, and of the abuse of the confidence reposed in him by the deceased in intrusting\" herself to his care for the purpose of taking her across the river.\u00a0 The finding of the trial court of the existence of <i>alevosia<\/i> (treachery) in connection with the murder of the woman can not be sustained, as there is no evidence as to the precise form and manner in which the crime was committed, and it is impossible to determine whether the attack upon her was or was not made in such a way as to sustain a finding of the existence of <i>alevosia<\/i> (treachery); nor can we sustain the contention of the Solicitor-General that the crime was committed with insult to or Jack of respect for the sex of the deceased, as the mere fact that the victim was a woman does not in itself constitute the aggravating circumstance set out in subsection 20 of article 10 of the Penal Code, and there is nothing in the evidence which discloses that aside from the unlawful taking of her life, there was any insult or disrespect shown her as a woman.<br\/><br\/>The commission of the crime of <i>robo con homicidio<\/i> (robbery with homicide), of which the accused was convicted, having been marked\u00a0 by several aggravating and no extenuating circumstances, the trial court properly imposed the penalty prescribed for that crime in its maximum degree, and sentenced the accused to death, and the judgment of conviction, modified by the commission of the finding as to <i>alevosia<\/i> (treachery) in taking the life of the woman, and the sentence of death imposed by the trial court should be and are hereby affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the defendant.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C, J., Torres, Johnson<\/i>, and <i>Moreland, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><\/div>",

No. 5071, August 18, 1909<\/h2>\n<h3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, <i>VS.<\/i> ALEJANDRO CAS, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>CARSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">The information in this case charges the commission of the crime of robbery, as follows:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"That the said accused, on or about the 18th day of July, 1908, in the municipality of Oas, Province of Albay, P. I., did maliciously, intentionally, and feloniously, with intent of gain and abuse of confidence, by means of force in an inhabited house, burst open and break a wooden box, and take, steal, and appropriate therefrom, in addition to other important papers, the sum of two hundred and fifty pesos (P250) that were kept therein, all of which belonged to Padre Antonio Elia, who has been prejudiced in the said amount; all contrary to law.\" <\/blockquote><br\/>The trial court found the defendant guilty of the crime of robbery, marked with the single aggravating circumstance that the offense was committed in the house of the complaining witness, and sentenced the defendant to three years, six months, and twenty-one\u00a0 days of <i>presidio correccional<\/i>, together with the accessory penalties prescribed by law.<br\/><br\/>The evidence of record fully sustains the findings of fact by the trial court, and from those findings it appears that the crime was committed at night in the manner and form set out in the information, the defendant, at the time of the commission of the offense, being a guest in the house of the complaining witness, with free access to the sleeping room wherein the box containing money was kept, as a result of the friendly and confidential relations existing between the guest and his host.<br\/><br\/>These facts clearly sustain the allegation of the information that the commission of the crime was marked with the aggravating circumstance of abuse of confidence, set out in subsection 10 of article 10 of the Penal Code; and further that advantage was taken of the darkness of the night as an aid to the successful execution of the acts constituting the crime; but the fact that the crime was committed in the house of the offended person should not in our opinion be taken into consideration as an aggravating circumstance in fixing the penalty to be imposed, because the commission of the offense in an inhabited house is an essential element of the crime, defined and penalized in article 508 of the Penal Code, of which the defendant was charged and convicted, and it would not be proper to take into consideration the fact that it was committed in an inhabited house so as to bring it under the comparatively severe penalties prescribed by that article, and then to take into consideration a second time the fact that it was committed in an inhabited house, to wit, that of the owner of the stolen property, to still further increase the penalty.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the accused in the trial court contended that since it does not appear that the accused (in the language of article 508 of the Penal Code) \"introduced himself\" into the house for the purpose of committing the robbery, there is no authority for the imposition upon him of the penalty prescribed in that article.\u00a0 This interesting contention deserves some consideration, for it will be seen that the article in question, if we consider only the form in which it is cast, affords some basis for the claim that the \"entering\" the house for the purpose of committing robbery is an essential element of the crime.<br\/><br\/>The article is as follows;<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"ART.\u00a0 508.\u00a0 Those who should with arms rob an inhabited house or public building, or one dedicated to religious worship, shall be punished with the penalty of <i>presidio mayor<\/i> in its medium degree to <i>cadena temporal<\/i> in its minimum degree, if the value of the articles stolen should exceed one thousand two hundred and fifty pesetas, and the male-factors should have entered the house or building where the robbery was committed, or any of its dependencies, by one of the following means:<br\/><br\/>\"1.\u00a0 By\u00a0 wrongful entry.<br\/><br\/>\"2.\u00a0 By breaking through a wall, ceiling, or floor, or by forcing a door or window.<br\/><br\/>\"3.\u00a0 By\u00a0 making use of false keys, picklocks, or other similar instruments.<br\/><br\/>\"4.\u00a0 By breaking open doors, wardrobes, etc., coffers, or any other kind of furniture or locked or sealed objects, or by taking the same away to be broken or forced open outside the place of robbery.<br\/><br\/>\"5.\u00a0 By making use of fictitious names or simulation of authority.<br\/><br\/>\"If the malefactors should not carry arms and the extent of the robbery should exceed one thousand two hundred and fifty pesetas, the penalty next lower shall be imposed.<br\/><br\/>\"The same rule shall be observed if the malefactors shall carry arms but the extent of the robbery does not exceed one thousand two hundred and fifty pesetas.<br\/><br\/>\"If they do not carry arms, nor does the extent of the robbery exceed one thousand two hundred and fifty pesetas, the penalty prescribed in the two preceding paragraphs shall be imposed on the\u00a0 culprits in its minimum degree.\" <\/blockquote> <br\/>It will be seen that, in form, subsection 4 appears to be dependent on the last provision of the first paragraph of the article in precisely the same manner as are subsections 1, 2, and 3; but upon consideration of the true sense of the various provisions of the article, it becomes clear that sub- section 4 touching the breaking open of doors, wardrobes, coffers, etc., within the house, could not have been intended, as are the other subsections, to specify means whereby a house may be entered;\u00a0 and is not, therefore, controlled by those provisions of the introductory paragraph in regard to the mode of entry into the house wherein the robbery is committed.<br\/><br\/>The following citations from decisions of the supreme court of Spain fully and satisfactorily dispose of this contention of counsel for the accused, and render further discussion at this time unnecessary:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"Whereas, under the provisions of article 515 of the Penal Code, those who with intent of gain shall take possession of personal property belonging to another, employing violence or intimidation of the persons, or force with regard to the things, are guilty of the crime of robbery; it being understood that force has been employed in taking possession of a thing when doors, wardrobes, coffers, or other kinds of furniture or objects, closed or sealed, are burst open, or stolen for the purpose of being broken open or forced outside of the place where the robbery was committed; whereas the crimes committed by the accused, Manuel Bouzan Gallo, deserve this legal qualification, and not that of theft as classified and punished by the <i>audiencia provincial de San Sebastian<\/i>, because the acts performed by him and which appear in the verdict of the jury, consist of having forced, by means of a small lever or nail, the top of the poor box in the church of Irun, appropriating to himself the money therein\u00a0 contained, determine the employment of force which characterizes the crime of robbery, which acts having been carried out on three different occasions constitute as many separate crimes; whereas the conditional phraseology of article 521 of the Penal Code is not a bar to the qualification as robbery of the deeds that gave rise to the appeal, because said provision does not refer to No. 4 of said article in view of the incongruence of both precepts, inasmuch as the former deals with robberies perpetrated in buildings forcibly entered by the guilty parties in the manner stated therein, and the latter refers to those where the crime is committed by forcing or breaking open the furniture, methods distinct from those used to enter a place as has been held by this tribunal; whereas, by virtue thereof, the <i>audiencia<\/i> that rendered the decision has committed an error of law and violated the legal provision invoked by the Attorney-General in his appeal, etc.\"\u00a0 (Judgment of March 6, 1897, published in the Gazette of the 27th of the same month and year, p. 212.)<br\/><br\/>\"Whereas the methods employed in entering the place where the robbery was committed, described in article 521 of the Penal Code, are not precise elements and conditions for all such cases as are defined in No. 4 thereof, inasmuch as some of them from their nature exclude said circumstance, and therefore, when an act that is expressly defined in said number is performed, the crime of robbery exists even though the guilty person may not have entered the place of the crime by the possible means that are named therein; whereas the deed committed by Paulino Jimeno is comprised within those enumerated in said\u00a0 No. 4, and that consequently an error of law was committed in the classification, and the articles cited as the basis for the appeal have been violated, etc.\" (Judgment of February 5, 1896, published in the Gazette of the 19th of November, p. 294.)<br\/><br\/>\"The same principle is established in another subsequent decision:\u00a0 Whereas this last circumstance is present in the case at bar, because the jury held in answer to the firat question that the accused did steal from the house of Nicanor Lozano several articles of clothing that were in a trunk owned by the latter, employing force in order to do so by breaking the lock thereof, it is unquestionable that the act so executed should be classified as robbery as coming under No. 4 of article 521 of said code, which case does not require that entry into the place of the robbery shall be effected by any of the means described in the other numbers of said article; whereas in view of the fact that the trial <i>sala<\/i> did not so consider it and that it classified the crime as theft, not as robbery, it committed an error of law, or violated the legal provisions invoked by the Attorney-General in the appeal interposed, etc.\"\u00a0 (Judgment of July 2, 1896, published in the Gazette of the 17th of January, 1897.) <\/blockquote> <br\/>In this connection, it is worthy of observation that the somewhat\u00a0 imperfect form in which the article is drawn may perhaps be accounted for by the fact that the sub-section under consideration was not found in the Spanish Code of 1850 and was originally introduced by the reformers of 1870.<br\/><br\/>The penalty prescribed in article 508 for the crime committed by the defendant is the minimum degree of the penalty immediately inferior to that prescribed for those who, with arms, rob an inhabited house of property the value of which exceeds 1,250 pesetas, that is to say, <i>presidio correccional<\/i> in its medium degree; and the commission of the offense being marked with the aggravating circumstances of nocturnity and abuse of confidence, with no extenuating circumstances, this penalty should be imposed in its maximum degree, that is to say, from three years, six months, and twenty-one days to four years and two months of <i>presidio correccional<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>The sentence imposed by the trial court is within the limits prescribed by the code, and the findings as to aggravating circumstances having been modified by substituting those of <i>nocturnity<\/i> and <i>abuse of confidence<\/i> for that of the <i>commission of the crime in the house of the offended party<\/i>, the judgment and sentence thus modified should be and are hereby affirmed, with the costs against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson<\/i>, and <i>Moreland, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><\/div>",

Julio Llorente, granted to the said bondsmen an additional thirty days' time within which to present the body of the defendant before the court.<br\/><br\/>Later it appears that the governor of the province, as well as the Constabulary of said province, made diligent search in said province to find the body of the defendant, but his whereabouts could not be ascertained.<br\/><br\/>Sixth.\u00a0 On the 7th day .of August, 1907, the fiscal of said province commenced an action in the Court of First Instance upon said bond against the said bondsmen for the purpose of recovering of them the amount of their liability as fixed by said bond.\u00a0 A copy of the said complaint was served upon each of the defendants upon the 14th day of August, 1907.<br\/><br\/>Later, each of the defendants duly appeared in said cause and after having; presented a demurrer, which was denied, filed an answer to said complaint, which answer was a general and a special denial.\u00a0 The special denial simply states that the facts set out in the complaint were not sufficient to constitute a cause of action.\u00a0 This special denial was nothing more nor less than a demurrer to the complaint, and should have been so considered.<br\/><br\/>The cause was brought to trial upon the 30th day of April, 1908. After hearing the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause, the judge of the lower court rendered a judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants, jointly and severally in the sum of P1,000 and costs.\u00a0 Against this sentence the defendants appealed and made the following assignments of error:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"1. The court erred in holding that the simple fact that the appearance of the accused was ordered for the rendering of the judgment, and that the fact that the said accused failed to appear and the bondsmen failed to present the body of the same, were sufficient grounds to enforce the bond.<br\/><br\/>\"2. The court, finally, erred in overruling the demurrer to the complaint, and in sentencing the defendants to pay jointly and severally the sum of P1,000 to the Government<br\/>of the United States in the Philippines.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>With reference to the first above assignment of error:\u00a0 By reference to the obligation or bond which the defendants gave, it will be seen that they imposed upon themselves the following obligation:<br\/><blockquote>\"A complaint having been filed in the Court of First Instance of San Isidro in the Province of Nueva Ecija on the 27th day of February, 1906, charging Victor Pangilinan with the crime of <i>robo en cuadrilla<\/i>, and he having been admitted to bail in the sum of P1,000, therefore, we, Don Pedro Carmen Legaspi, of San Isidro, Nueva Ecija, and Don Antonio Elvina, of the same place, jointly and severally, hereby guarantee that the accused Victor Pangilinan shall appear before the court which will try him to answer said charge, and that he shall be at all times amenable to the orders and resolutions of the court, and, if convicted, he shall appear for judgment and present himself for the execution thereof; and, if he fails to perform any of these conditions, that we will pay to the United States the sum of P1,000.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The plaintiff proved, and the defendants did not attempt to deny, that no part of this obligation had been complied with.\u00a0 By reason of their failure to comply with the conditions of the bond they were liable to pay the amount of the obligation assumed by said bond, and the lower court committed no error in rendering a judgment against them for the amount of said bond.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the second assignment of error:\u00a0 Upon an examination of the complaint filed in said cause, we are convinced, and so hold, that the complaint was sufficient in law to show a cause of action existing against the said defendants.\u00a0 Therefore the judgment of the lower court is hereby affirmed, with costs.<br\/><br\/>While there is no objection raised in the record to the practice adopted by the plaintiff in this cause in the court below, yet <i>we are of the opinion that the practice in commencing an ordinary action upon a recognizance<\/i> or a bond such as constitutes the basis of the action in the present cause, <i>was not intended by section 76 of General Orders, No. 58.<\/i> This method of recovering the amount due upon a bond given in a criminal cause, in our opinion, is entirely too cumbersome,and is subject to too many delays.\u00a0 Section 76 above cited, provides as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"If without sufficient cause the defendant neglects to appear for arraignment, trial, or judgment, or neglects to appear on any other occasion when his presence may be required in court, or fails to surrender himself in execution of the judgment, the court must direct the fact of his neglect or failure to be entered in the records of the cause, and declare the undertaking or deposit, as the case may be, to be forfeited. But if at any time within thirty days thereafter the defendant or his counsel appears and satisfactorily explains the neglect or failure, the court may direct the forfeiture to be discharged upon such terms as it may consider just. If the forfeiture is not so discharged, the promotor fiscal shall at once proceed by action against the bail upon their undertaking.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The last sentence of said section provides that \"if the forfeiture is not so discharged, the promotor fiscal shall at once proceed by action against the bail upon their under- taking.\"\u00a0 We believe that the word \"action\" as used here does not necessarily mean the ordinary action for the purpose of recovering a sum of money, but rather that the promotor fiscal shall at once take such steps as may be necessary against the bail for the purpose of recovering the amount due under such bond.\u00a0 The practice which has been adopted, as we believe, by the Courts of First Instance generally, is substantially as follows:<br\/><br\/>(1) If the defendant does not appear after final sentence for the purpose of receiving the penalty imposed by the court, the court shall make a record of this fact;<br\/><br\/>(2) The court shall declare the bond forfeited;<br\/><br\/>(3) The court shall then notify the said bondsmen and give them thirty days within which to present the body of the defendant;<br\/><br\/>(4) If the bondsmen do not present the body of the defendant within thirty days, at the expiration of that time the court shall give them notice to show cause why a judgment should not be rendered against them for the amount of the bond; and<br\/><br\/>(5) If no sufficient reason appears or is given by the bondsmen for not presenting the body of the defendant within the time specified above, the court may then render a judgment against the said bondsmen for the amount represented by said bond, upon which judgment an execution should be issued at one without further delay against said bondsmen.\u00a0 In other words, in order to enforce the bond, the prosecuting attorney should not bring a new action, nor institute an ordinary action; he should only take the necessary steps for the execution of the prior judgment of forfeiture and require the bondsmen to pay the amount of the bond or attach a portion of their property the proceeds of which on sale should be enough to satisfy the liability of the bondsmen.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

If the forfeiture is not so discharged, the promotor fiscal shall at once proceed by action against the bail upon their undertaking.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>This action was evidently commenced by virtue of the last provision contained in this section, and in my opinion was prematurely brought.\u00a0 Such an action can only be brought \"if the forfeiture is not so discharged.\"\u00a0 The forfeiture can not be discharged until it has been declared, the sureties have thirty days after such declaration in which to act and during that time no action can be commenced against them.\u00a0 No forfeiture has ever been declared in the criminal case.\u00a0 That the facts showing such a forfeiture might be proven in this action can not be the equivalent of the declaration required in the criminal case, for the period of thirty days would thereby be eliminated.\u00a0 Section 76 of General Orders, No. 58, is similar in this respect to Act No. 1778, which provides that an action for forcible entry by reason of nonpayment of rent shall not be brought until three days have elapsed after a demand for payment has been made.\u00a0 The Court, in the criminal case, can still declare the forfeiture and, if it is not discharged within thirty days thereafter, another action can be brought.<\/div>",

ROMAN AND CIRILO JAUCIAN, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">On February 20,1907, while the suit between said parties was pending in this court by virtue of the appeal presented by the defendants, counsel for the plaintiff company petitioned the lower court to issue an execution for the enforcement of the judgment of September 17,1906, appealed from by the defendants and by which they were sentenced to pay the sum of P61,500 with interest thereon at the rate of 10 per cent per annum from the 31st of December, 1905, plus the sum of P1,500, as agreed upon, for lawyer's fees and the costs, in case said defendants should not file a bond sufficient to secure the payment of said judgment if confirmed, or in case the property mortgaged should not be sufficient to satisfy the aforesaid judgment; the court below, by order dated February 27,1907, granted the petition, and ordered the defendants to file a bond for P20,000 in favor of the plaintiff for the purpose of suspending the sale of the mortgaged property, notifying them that if they failed to present the bond on or before March 15, 1907, the clerk of the court should issue the corresponding execution against the property mortgaged; this\u00a0 bond ordered by the court appears to have been furnished.<br\/><br\/>By a written petition of April 12, 1908, counsel for the plaintiff asked the court to approve the auction sale of the mortgaged property and the execution of the corresponding bill of sale, in accordance with the statements made by the sheriff.<br\/><br\/>By another petition dated the 15th of said month, counsel for defendants prayed that the sale made on the 10th of the same\u00a0 month be annulled, and, consequently, that the sales made by the sheriff be also declared null and void, and that they be granted any relief that might be just and equitable.\u00a0 It is alleged in that petition that the clerk of the Court of First Instance, having on February 18 last received a certified copy of the decision of this court confirming the judgment entered in the aforesaid case, sent notice of the said decision to the parties by mail, on the same date, and on the 14th of March following issued an order of execution against the defendants without the request of the plaintiff nor any order of tlie court for the sale of said property, and before the time prescribed by law, from the 18th of February up to the 14th of March, 1908, for the granting of the petition for the sale of said property, had expired; that notwithstanding the fact that the plaintiff petitioned for the execution of the judgment during the pendency of the above-mentioned appeal, the defendants filed, by order of the court, a bond for P20,000 for the purpose of suspending the sale asked for; and that the provisions of article 127 of the Mortgage Law were not complied with at the auction sale of said property made On April 10, by selling the property at the upset' price stipulated\u00a0 in the mortgage deed, because the sheriff made the sale at a price lower than that fixed for each lot, they being sold at P13,960, an\u00a0 amount greatly disproportionate to the real value and cost of said property.<br\/><br\/>After the hearing of both motions on April 20 above-cited, the court on the same date entered judgment ordering the approval of the sale and excluding the parties in the suit from all their rights in the property described, which were transferred by the sale to the purchaser, and he directed the clerk of the court to issue a certified copy of said decision to the registrar of property for registration.\u00a0 To this order counsel for the defendants duly excepted and in due time presented the bill of exceptions, which was approved by order of the 30th of the same month and after-wards filed in this court.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the defendants, for the reasons above stated, insists that the auction sale of the property of the defendants that was mortgaged to guarantee the payment of a credit of the plaintiff company, be declared null and void.<br\/><br\/>It is a fact, attested by the appellants, that after a certified copy of the decision rendered by this court<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> was received by the lower court on February 18,1908, the clerk of that court notified both parties by mail of the confirmation of the judgment and on the 14th of March following issued an execution against the defendants, and the mortgaged property was sold at public auction on April 10, in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br\/><br\/>Inasmuch as the appeal was decided in favor of the plaintiff company and the judgment of the court below affirmed by this court, the suit is already settled, and there is no reason for discussing the certainty of the credit or the rights of the parties; final process should have been commenced at once for the enforcement of the judgment; and in view of the fact that the plaintiff creditor previously asked for said execution, and that the parties, who had already been informed of the decision of this court in the second instance, were again notified of it by the clerk of the lower court, and that the judge upon being informed of said decision ordered its execution, although said clerk did not record the order or judicial decree, there are no legal reasons for now declaring that the proceedings are not in accordance with the law, and that the defendants have suffered any damage to their rights; the parties having been notified of the confirmation of the judgment of first instance, the proper proceeding was and is the issue of an order for the execution thereof and for the sale of the mortgaged property, unless the debtors should have paid the amount stated in the order and the costs before the sale took place and thus have prevented it.\u00a0 This they did not do from February 18 up to April 9, 1908.\u00a0 (Sec. 456, Code of Civil Procedure.)<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below, sustained by this court, ordered the defendants to pay the amount therein set forth, together with interest and costs, before the first day of the next term of court to that in which it was rendered, and also ordered that the mortgaged property should be sold in case of nonpayment within the time so prescribed.<br\/><br\/>All that which has been done by the court below falls within the terms of the judgment, and if it was not executed within the time therein prescribed, it was due to the appeal presented by the defendants; but the former having been sustained and the parties notified of the decision of this court on February 18, it was proper, on March 14, after the expiration of twenty-three days, to issue the order of execution, as there was neither good cause nor legal reason to delay the sale which, after due notice, was held on the 10th of April following.<br\/><br\/>Section 257 of the Code of Civil Procedure does not provide, in the English text, that in case of nonpayment, a previous requisition is necessary in order to proceed to the sale of the property in the manner and form prescribed by law for the sale of real estate under execution, etc.\u00a0 It is sufficient that the defendant debtor has been notified in order to proceed to the execution of the judgment, in case he fails to pay the amount therein required.<br\/><br\/>The fact that the order or decree providing for the issue of the order of execution was not set forth, does not constitute a cause for the nullification of the sale of the mortgaged property, as such order is equivalent to a confirmation of the statements contained in the judgment then\u00a0 made final.<br\/><br\/>The debtors stated in the mortgage deed the amount for which each one of the 17 lots therein mentioned would respond each one of them being subsidiarily liable for the balance still due from others; but the amounts stated in said deed were not fixed as the upset prices of the property in case of sale at auction, according to article 127 of the Mortgage Law; but even in case that such prices had been so stipulated, it can not be said that the sale of the mortgaged property without upset price arid to the highest bidder, is not in conformity with the law of civil procedure now in force.<br\/><br\/>The procedure followed in the sale of said property, which sale was confirmed by the order appealed from, is that provided by sections\u00a0 256 to 261, in connection with sections 443 to 463, of the Code of Civil Procedure, which repealed the former <i>Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil<\/i>, and, among others, the said articles 127 and\u00a0 128 of the Mortgage Law.<br\/><br\/>The sale of the mortgaged property took place without a fixed price, to the highest bidder, because the law of civil procedure now in force does not require the fixing of prices at judicial sales, so that, even in case the contracting parties have agreed in the mortgage deed that the mortgaged property should be sold at an upset price, the sale would be made at the price offered by the highest bidder, in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, without taking into account the stipulations made by the parties, as provided by former laws now repealed; therefore the contention of the defendants and appellants that the sales of the aforesaid properties should be declared null, can not be sustained.<br\/><br\/>The question involved in this case is one of an obligation contracted in 1905 under the Civil Code, article 1255 of which provides that the contracting parties may make agreements with clauses and conditions which are not, in contravention of law, morals, or public order; it is provided by the law that, even though an upset price is stipulated for the sale, such agreement between the contracting parties shall not be complied with, because their wishes can not be substituted for the rules of procedure established by law for the settlement of suits before the courts, thus permitting them by mutual agreement to alter or modify the law to the grave damage of order and public interest; no reason can therefore be alleged, in the absence of an agreement as to upset price at the sale, upon which to base the petition for the nullification of said sales made to the highest bidder according to law, and consequently, such sales can not, under these circumstances, have caused any damage to the appellants.\u00a0 As to the other matter at issue, it is hereby declared that the doctrine\u00a0 established in case No. 2422, Banco Espa\u00f1ol-Filipino <i>vs<\/i>.

admitted certain allegations and denied others.\u00a0 The defendant admitted that he owed the plaintiff P188.39 but claimed that the plaintiff owed him\u00a0 the sum of P482.14, and that the plaintiff, therefore, still owed to the defendant the difference between P188.39 and P482.14, or the sum of P293.75, for which latter amount the defendant prayed for judgment, with interest and costs against the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>After hearing the evidence adduced during\u00a0 the trial of the cause, the lower court found from the evidence that the defendant, as administrator of the estate of Antonio Sanchez Mu\u00f1oz, or that part of the said estate belonging to the plaintiff, owed the plaintiff the sum of P3,447.46, with interest at 6 per cent until the same amount should be fully paid.<br\/><br\/>From this decision of the lower court the defendant appealed and made the following assignments of error:<br\/><blockquote>\"1.\u00a0 The court erred in holding that the defendant, from September 17, 1901, to October 6, 1906, managed and administered the estate of Sanchez Mu\u00f1oz as a judicial administrator or executor.<br\/><br\/>\"2.\u00a0 The court erred in holding that the defendant was responsible to the plaintiffs for the loans made to different persons for different accounts, and for credits against the persons mentioned in the complaint.<br\/><br\/>\"3.\u00a0 The court erred in declaring in the judgment that the difference in the weight of the scales was illegal.<br\/><br\/>\"4.\u00a0 And the court erred in sentencing the defendant to pay the costs specified in the judgment.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>With reference to the first above assignment of error, from the record brought to this court the following facts appear:<br\/><br\/>First.\u00a0 That the defendant Leopoldo Teran was, on the 17th day of September, 1901, appointed as administrator of said estate.\u00a0 The record also discloses that the defendant entered into a bond in the sum of 10,000 dollars, gold, for the faithful performance of his duties as such representative of the estate of Antonio Sanchez Mu\u00f1oz.<br\/><br\/>Second.\u00a0 The record further discloses that upon the 18th day of March, 1902, the Court of First Instance of the Province of Albay appointed Maria Mu\u00f1oz y Gomez as guardian for the said Maria Manuela and Maria del Carmen Sanchez Mu\u00f1oz, and that the said Maria Munoz y Gomez gave the required bond for the faithful performance of her duties as such guardian.<br\/><br\/>Third.\u00a0 While there are some indications in the record that the defendant continued to act as the administrator of said estate after the appointment of the said Maria Mu\u00f1oz y Gomez, up to and including the 6th day of October, 1906, yet the fact exists and must be accepted as true that the said Maria Mu\u00f1oz y Gomez was the actual representative of the said Maria Manuela and Maria del Carmen Sanchez Mu\u00f1oz in the administration of their interests in the estate of the said Antonio Sanchez Mu\u00f1oz, from and after the 18th day of March, 1902, until the 6th day of October, 1906, and therefore the said Maria Mu\u00f1oz y Gomez, as such guardian and administratrix of the estate of the said minors, must be held responsible for the property belonging to said minors during the period while she (Maria Mu\u00f1oz y Gomez) was the actual guardian\u00a0 of said minors.<br\/><br\/>Fourth.\u00a0 On the 6th day of October, 1906, the Court of First Instance of the Province of Albay, for the reason that the said Maria Mu\u00f1oz y Gomez was not a resident of the Philippine Islands at the time of her appointment (the 18th day of March, 1902) removed her as such guardian and appointed as guardian of said minors Felix Samson, and required from said Samson, as provisional guardian, a bond in the sum of P2,000.\u00a0 On the 18th day of October, 1906, the said Samson duly executed the bond as required.<br\/><br\/>From the order of the judge annulling the appointment of the said Maria Mu\u00f1oz y Gomez her lawyers appealed to the Supreme Court, which appeal was subsequently withdrawn.\u00a0 The order therefore revoking the appointment of the said Maria Mu\u00f1oz y Gomez became final.\u00a0 The mere fact, however, that she had been removed as said guardian did not relieve her, nor her bondsmen from liability to the minors during the time that she was duly acting as said guardian.\u00a0 It must be clear, therefore, that the said Maria Mu\u00f1oz y Gomez is responsible to said minors for the administration of their interests in the estate of the said Antonio Sanchez Mu\u00f1oz from the time of her acceptance of said appointment on the 18th day of March, 1902, up to the time of her removal on the 6th day of October, 1906.\u00a0 If during this time she allowed other persons to handle the property of her wards and if any mismanagement or loss occurred thereby, the responsibility must fall upon her.\u00a0 Unquestionably, she may have an action against the persons to whom she entrusted the direct management of said estate for any loss which they may have negligently and corruptly occasioned her.\u00a0 Therefore, if any loss occurred to the plaintiff between the 18th\u00a0 day of March, 1902, and the 6th day of October, 1906, they have a right of action only against the said Maria Mu\u00f1oz y Gomez as their legal guardian and under the law the administratrix of the property of their estate.<br\/><br\/>In the claim presented by the plaintiff against the defendant no dates are given showing the time of the particular loss or losses occasioned by the defendant.\u00a0 As was said above, the defendant was liable for losses only during the time that he was acting as the legal representative of the said minors in the\u00a0 management of their estate, from the 17th day of September, 1901, up to the time that he was superseded by the said Maria Mu\u00f1oz y Gomez, on the 18th day of March, 1902.\u00a0 There is no proof showing that any of the losses constituting the amount which the plaintiff claims occurred within this period.\u00a0 However, the defendant acknowledged that of the amount claimed by the plaintiff, he owes to them the sum of P188.39.<br\/><br\/>There is no claim of any loss or that the estate has not been properly managed\u00a0 since the appointment of the said Felix Samson on the 6th day of October, 1906.<br\/><br\/>From a consideration of all of the evidence brought to this court, we reach the following conclusions:<br\/><br\/>First.\u00a0 That the defendant, Leopoldo Teran, was the duly appointed\u00a0 and recognized representative of the minors Maria Manuela and Maria del Carmen Sanchez Mu\u00f1oz in the administration of their interests in the estate of the said Antonio Sanchez Mu\u00f1oz from the 17th day of September, 1901, until the 18th day of March, 1902.<br\/><br\/>Second.\u00a0 That the said Do\u00f1a Maria Mu\u00f1oz y Gomez was the duly appointed representative of the said minors in the administration of their interests in the estate of the said Antonio Sanchez Mu\u00f1oz from the 18th day of March, 1902, until the 6th day of October, 1906.<br\/><br\/>Third.\u00a0 That the said Leopoldo Teran was responsible to the plaintiff (the said minors) for the fruits and profits resulting from their interests in the estate of the said Antonio Sanchez Munoz from the said 17th day of September, 1901, to the 18th day of March, 1902.<br\/><br\/>Fourth.\u00a0 That the said Do\u00f1a Maria Mu\u00f1oz y Gomez was responsible to the plaintiff (the said minors) for the fruits and profits resulting from the management of the estate of the said Don Antonio Sanchez Mu\u00f1oz from the 18th day of March, 1902, until the 6th day of October, 1906.<br\/><br\/>The record not disclosing that any of the amounts claimed by the plaintiff were due as a result of the management of the said estate during the time while the said defendant was administering their interests therein, except the sum of P188.39, admitted to be due by the defendant, we are of the opinion, and so hold, that the only amount which the plaintiff is entitled to recover in this action is the said amount of P188.39.<br\/><br\/>Do\u00f1a Maria Mu\u00f1oz y Gomez was, as above indicated, removed upon the theory that her appointment was void because she did not reside in the Philippine Islands.\u00a0 There is nothing in the law which requires the courts to appoint residents only as administrators or guardians.\u00a0 However, notwithstanding the fact that there are no statutory requirements upon this question, the courts, charged with the responsibilities of protecting the estates of deceased persons, wards of the estate, etc., will find much difficulty in complying with this duty by appointing administrators and guardians who are not personally subject to their jurisdiction.\u00a0 Notwithstanding that there is no statutory requirement, the courts should not consent to the appointment of persons as administrators\u00a0 and guardians who are not personally subject to the jurisdiction of our courts here.<br\/><br\/>We deem it unnecessary to discuss the other assignments of error for the reason that there is no evidence in the record indicating any liability on the part of the defendant other than his admission above indicated.<br\/><br\/>For the reasons above stated, the judgment of the lower court is hereby reversed, without any special finding as to costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Victoria (10 Phil. Rep., 10), the court said (p. 16):<br\/><blockquote>\"In the case of Alfonso <i>vs<\/i>. Natividad the court said (p. 245) :<br\/><br\/>\"'The\u00a0 question whether or not this rule for the settlement of the affairs of the conjugal partnership, when it is dissolved by the death of the husband, is equally applicable when the partnership is dissolved by the death of the wife, we do not consider.'<br\/><br\/>\"It is necessary now, however, to resolve that question.<br\/><br\/>\"The husband is by law the manager of the conjugal partnership.\u00a0 (Art. 1412, Civil Code.)\u00a0 His debts, contracted during marriage, are\u00a0 its\u00a0 debts.\u00a0 (Art. 1408.)\u00a0 Upon the death of the wife he becomes the surviving partner, and we do not doubt that he is the person called upon to settle the affairs of the partnership.\u00a0 It could not have been intended that, upon the death of the wife, leaving the husband surviving, the property which the husband had administered and in which he was directly interested, should be taken out of his hands and delivered over to an administrator appointed in proceedings for the settlement of his wife's estate, and we hold that, where a conjugal partnership is dissolved by the death of the wife, the surviving husband is the administrator of the affairs of the conjugal partnership until they are finally settled and liquidated.\" <\/blockquote> When an ordinary commercial partnership is dissolved by the death of one of the partners, the administrator of the deceased partner is not the person who has the right to settle the affairs of the partnership.\u00a0 On the contrary, its affairs must be settled by the surviving partner or partners, and certain of the rights of the executor or administrator and the surviving partner in such case are defined in section 664 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br\/><br\/>For the purpose of settling the affairs of\u00a0 a dissolved partnership the surviving husband is entitled to the possession not only of all the property belonging to the partnership, but also to the <i>bienes parafernales<\/i> of the wife.\u00a0 (Prado <i>vs<\/i>. Lagera, 7 Phil. Rep., 395; De la Rama <i>vs<\/i>. De la Rama, 7 Phil. Rep., 745.)<br\/><br\/>In the present case, therefore, the person entitled to the possession of all of this property was the appellee Jorge Pardo, and the administrator appointed in the judicial proceeding for the settlement of the estate of the deceased wife was not entitled to the possession of any of it until the partnership affairs had been liquidated.\u00a0 The proceeding for the settlement of the estate of the wife could not be terminated until the husband had liquidated the affairs of the partnership and delivered to the administrator of the wife's estate the part belonging to it, all in accordance with articles 1418 to 1426 of the Civil Code, and section 685 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br\/><br\/>The practice indicated in these decisions does not seem to have\u00a0 been followed in this proceeding for the settlement of the estate of the deceased wife.\u00a0 It appears that an administrator was appointed in such special proceeding, and on the 26th day of January, 1907, the court in that said proceeding made an order reciting that some of the property included in the inventory which had been made therein was the separate property of the surviving husband, and other property was the separate property of the deceased wife, and he ordered certain specific property, consisting apparently of jewels, turned over to the heirs of the deceased Do\u00f1a Manuela.\u00a0 The same order directed the settlement of the affairs of the conjugal partnership in this special proceeding, and after the payment of the debts thereof, the delivery of one-half of what remained to the appellee, the husband, and the other half to the heirs of the deceased wife.<br\/><br\/>On the 20th day of December, 1907, nearly a year afterwards, the appellee, Jorge Pardo, presented a motion to the court below in this special proceeding relating to the settlement of the estate of his deceased wife, wherein he stated that in the order of January 26, 1907, the court had made a mistake in regard to one certain jewel, saying that that jewel, so far from being the separate property of his deceased wife, belonged to the conjugal partnership, and he asked that the order be corrected so as to state that that jewel was part of the conjugal property.\u00a0 On the 22d of June, 1908, the court made an order in conformity with the prayer of this petition, relieving him of the obligation of turning that particular jewel over to the heirs of his deceased wife.\u00a0 From that order the heirs of\u00a0 the deceased wife, Tomas Amancio and Honorata Losada, have appealed.<br\/><br\/>It will be seen from what has been stated that the court below erred in settling the affairs of the conjugal partnership in the proceeding for the settlement of the estate of the deceased wife.\u00a0 In entering orders looking to that end, error was committed, as the court had no authority to make such a settlement in that proceeding.\u00a0 The order of the 26th of January, was, therefore, erroneous.\u00a0 But it is said by the appellant here that, if erroneous, the appellee Pardo should have appealed from the order;\u00a0 that he did not do so, but on the contrary allowed nearly a year to elapse before making any motion to have the order amended, and that the court, after such a lapse of time, had no authority to entertain such a petition.<br\/><br\/>If the court had no authority in that special proceeding to make the order of the 26th of January, 1907, the appellee was under no obligation to appeal therefrom.\u00a0 Whether he would be under such obligation if he had appeared in the proceeding and voluntarily submitted to the court his right to the ownership of this jewel, is a question we are not called upon to decide, because there is nothing in the case to show that he ever took any part in the proceeding for the settlement of his wife's estate until he presented, on the 20th of December, 1907, his motion asking for an amendment of the order of the 26th of January of that year.\u00a0 (Franco <i>vs<\/i>. O'Brien,<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> No. 5074, decided March 27, 1909). Our opinion is that both of the orders above mentioned were made by the court without authority, and the one made on the 22d of June, 1908, amending the order of the 26th of January, 1907, having been appealed from, should be set aside.\u00a0 It does not follow, however, from the setting aside of this order, that the order of the 26th of January, 1907, should be reinstated.\u00a0 It appears, from the last order made in the proceeding, that the jewel in question is in the possession of the appellee.\u00a0 As has been stated before, he, being the surviving partner of the conjugal society, is\u00a0 entitled to the possession of the jewel, whether it was property of the partnership or the private property of the deceased wife.\u00a0 The order of January 26, 1907, having been made in a proceeding to which the appellee was not a party, can not prejudice his right of possession.\u00a0 That right rests not upon that order but upon the general principles of law above referred to.<br\/><br\/>It is, therefore, ordered that the order of the 22d of June, 1908,\u00a0 be set aside, and it is declared that the appellee is entitled to the possession of the jewel until the question of its ownership is decided in proper proceedings.\u00a0 No costs will be allowed to either party in this court.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">The complaint asks damages for breach of a written contract between plaintiff and defendant for the delivery of the machinery, complete, for a ship in process of construction belonging to the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>The defendant, in its answer, denies the allegations of the complaint generally, and sets up as a counterclaim the balance due\u00a0 from plaintiff on the purchase price of the machinery aforesaid, and asks for an affirmative judgment against the plaintiff\u00a0 accordingly.<br\/><br\/>The defendant secured in the court below an affirmative judgment against the plaintiff for the sum of P9,216.60, with interest thereon, at the rate of 6 per cent per annum, from February 28, 1907.\u00a0 The plaintiff made a motion for a new trial upon the grounds that the evidence does not justify the decision of the court and that the decision is contrary to law.\u00a0 This motion was denied, and the plaintiff duly excepted and perfected his appeal.<br\/><br\/>On the 19th of September, 1907, the plaintiff was the owner of a freight ship called the <i>Constancia<\/i>, then in course of construction in plaintiff's shops in the city of Manila.\u00a0 The vessel was designed for the coastwise trade in the Philippine Islands.\u00a0 On that date, and for some time prior thereto, one William Swann was the consulting engineer of the defendant, in charge of its machinery department.\u00a0 Swann was at that time an engineer and naval architect and had been working as an engineer substantially all his life.\u00a0 On the date mentioned he was, and for some time theretofore had been, a naval architect, a member of the Institute of Engineers and Shipbuilders of Scotland, and a member of the Institute of Naval Architects of Great Britain.\u00a0 The plaintiff was acquainted with Swann and knew him to be an engineer and naval architect of long experience.\u00a0 On the date referred to Rogaciano Rodriguez, acting for and on behalf of the plaintiff and as his agent, made a written contract with Swann, acting for and on behalf of the defendant and as its agent, wherein and whereby the plaintiff agreed to purchase of the defendant, and the defendant agreed to sell and deliver to the plaintiff, certain machinery, complete, for the ship <i>Constancia<\/i> already referred to.\u00a0 Prior to the making of the contract on the date referred to, and during the negotiations leading up to the contract and in connection with them, Swann, the agent of the defendant, visited the shipyard of the plaintiff and inspected the steamship <i>Constancia<\/i>, then being constructed.\u00a0 This he did several different times.\u00a0 The inspections were made for the purpose of determining the kind and nature of the machinery which would be suitable to the ship referred to.\u00a0 Neither the plaintiff nor his agent, Rogaciano Rodriguez, was a marine or other engineer and they knew little or nothing about the kind, of machinery which should be placed in the ship they were building.\u00a0 They relied entirely upon the recommendations, knowledge, and experience of the engineer Swann.\u00a0 The plaintiff had in mind and stated to Swann, among other things, the speed which it was necessary that the <i>Constancia<\/i> should have in order to be available as a coastwise vessel, and left the kind, nature, and construction of the machinery to the greater knowledge and experience of Swann.\u00a0 This is particularly true of the propeller placed in that vessel, the questions relative to which are the main issues of this case.\u00a0 The contract, so far as its interpretation is disputed, reads as follows:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"One brass propeller of 8' diameter and suitable pitch for an expected speed of ship about 9\u00bd knots.<br\/><br\/>*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>\"The whole to be suitable for a wooden ship of 150 ft. long by 24 ft. beam and 14 ft. depth, as per plan supplied by Sr. Juan Rodriguez.\" <\/blockquote><br\/>Before the contract was entered into, the plaintiff delivered to Swann, as the defendant's agent, a plan of the hull of said vessel.\u00a0 Thereafter Swann delivered to the plaintiff a plan of the entire vessel, showing the machinery placed therein.\u00a0 The plans in question showed length and breadth of the\u00a0 hull, its general outline and the number of feet of water which it drew.\u00a0 <i>These plans also showed location and outline of the sternpost and rudderpost of said ship.<\/i><br\/><br\/>In the process of manufacturing the propeller the defendant thought it discovered that the propeller described in the contract\u00a0 would not give the speed required by the contract and notified the plaintiff to that effect, and at the same time asked permission to put in its place a propeller 10 feet in diameter.\u00a0 This the plaintiff declined to permit.<br\/><br\/>The machinery, so purchased, was delivered, except certain items which were required to be upon all vessels by the rules of the customs officials of the city of Manila and about which there is little or no dispute.\u00a0 Certain other articles of small value, necessary for the completion of the machinery, seem not to have\u00a0 been delivered, but concerning these there is very little dispute between the parties.<br\/><br\/>The machinery was duly installed in the vessel upon its delivery.\u00a0 Upon the trial of the ship, after the installation of its\u00a0 machinery, it was found that all of the machinery worked well except the propeller.\u00a0 This, instead of giving the ship a speed of about 9\u00bd knots an hour, gave a speed of less than 7 knots an hour.\u00a0 The failure of the propeller to give the required speed to the vessel is substantially the only point in controversy in this case.<br\/><br\/>The contention of\u00a0 the plaintiff is that, under the terms of the contract, the defendant\u00a0 was obliged to furnish a propeller 8 feet\u00a0 in diameter which would give the <i>Constancia<\/i> a speed of 9\u00bd knots an hour, and that, failing in that, the contract was broken and the defendant should be held liable for all damages resulting.<br\/><br\/>The defendant contends that the machinery was to be according to the specifications in the contract and that, if these specifications were complied with, it does not matter what may be the actual speed of the vessel.\u00a0 It claims that it had nothing to do with the construction of the steamship or the placing therein of the machinery.\u00a0 The defendant also claims that, under the terms of the contract, there was no guaranty of speed, and that, if the propeller was 8 feet in diameter and of brass, it would fulfill the terms of the contract even though the speed of the vessel\u00a0 should not exceed a knot per hour.<br\/><br\/>The contract, by its words, expressly requires that the defendant must furnish a propeller which shall give to the steamship <i>Constancia<\/i> a speed of about 9\u00bd knots per hour.<br\/><br\/>The language of the contract is so plain, and the negotiations leading up to the execution of the contract point in one direction so clearly, that there ought to be little need of discussion.\u00a0 But the parties have insisted so strongly upon the justice of their several contentions that a detailed discussion is considered advisable.<br\/><br\/>The language is without ambiguity.\u00a0 The defendant agrees therein to furnish \"One brass propeller of 8' diameter and suitable pitch for an expected speed of ship about 9\u00bd knots;\" and \"The whole to be suitable for a wooden ship 150 ft. long by 24 ft. beam and 14 ft. depth, as per plan supplied by Sr. Juan Rodriguez.\"<br\/><br\/>The ship for which the machinery, including the propeller, was designed, is specifically described in the contract and is identified without question.\u00a0 That ship is the <i>Constancia<\/i>, a coastwise vessel 150 feet long, 24 feet wide and 14 feet deep.\u00a0 These are the measurements contained in the contract.\u00a0 This was the only ship for which the plaintiff needed machinery.\u00a0 It was the only ship he was constructing.\u00a0 During the course of the negotiations the defendant's agent, Swann, its engineer and naval architect, in company with the plaintiff or the plaintiff's agent, several times visited the yard wherein the ship was being built and examined it for the purpose of making the\u00a0 contract for the machinery.\u00a0 During these different visits the kind of machinery, its purpose and value were discussed by the parties.\u00a0 This is conceded.\u00a0 Plans of the hull and the interior of the vessel were exchanged by the parties at various times, either before or after the making of the contract.\u00a0 The plaintiff, in particular, delivered to the defendant, prior to the execution of the contract, a plan of the hull of the vessel, with its measurements.\u00a0 Later the defendant delivered to the plaintiff a plan, in considerable detail, showing the vessel with the machinery figured as having been already placed in it.<br\/><br\/>Swann was a naval architect and marine engineer of long experience, which fact was known to the plaintiff and his agent, and the general details relative to the kind and character of the machinery were left to the defendant.\u00a0 The thing mainly insisted upon by the plaintiff was the result that should be produced.\u00a0 The plaintiff himself testifies, and this is undisputed by the defendant, that he relied upon Swann in these particulars, especially in reference to the propeller and the pitch which it should have; and, by reason of that reliance, the pitch in feet and inches which the propeller should have when placed in the ship was not stated in the contract.\u00a0 Instead, the plaintiff placed in the contract what the propeller should do, rather than what it should be.\u00a0 The diameter of the propeller was fixed by the structure of the vessel and could not exceed 8 feet or 8\u00bd feet.\u00a0 The pitch which the propeller should have in order to give 9\u00bd knots an hour to the steamship was left to the greater knowledge and experience of the defendant's agent, Swann.\u00a0 The plaintiff placed the condition <i>only that it should produce a certain result<\/i> when attached to the ship <i>Constancia<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>The words of the contract clearly demand, upon the part of the defendant, that it furnish a propeller with a pitch proper to give the steamship <i>Constancia<\/i> a speed of about 9\u00bd knots per hour.\u00a0 Language for that purpose could scarcely be made plainer than the language used.<br\/><br\/>The defendant contends that \"the machinery was to be according to the specifications in the contract and that, if these specifications were complied with, it does not matter what may be the actual speed of the vessel.\"\u00a0 The trouble with this contention is that one of the <i>specifications<\/i> of the contract is <i>speed<\/i>, namely, a speed of 9\u00bd knots per hour, and the specifications of the contract can not be complied with unless a speed of 9\u00bd knots an hour, or there-abouts, is given.\u00a0 Simply because the specific pitch in feet and inches is not stated in the contract does not mean that there is no specification upon that point.\u00a0 The contract provides that the defendants shall supply to the plaintiff, among other things, one brass propeller 8\u00a0 feet in diameter with suitable pitch for an expected speed of ship about 9\u00bd knots.\u00a0 The word \"suitable\" has reference to two objects, the antecedent subject, \"pitch\" of the propeller, and the subsequent object, \"ship;\" and the meaning of the word requires that the subject, \"pitch\" of the propeller, shall have qualities which will harmonize so perfectly with the qualities of the object, \"ship,\" that a certain and specified result, viz, a speed of 9\u00bd knots, shall be produced.\u00a0 The word \"suitable,\" referring to the vessel in which the propeller is to be placed as well as to the propeller itself, the pitch of the propeller must, therefore, be suitable to that vessel, and it is not suitable to that vessel, under the terms of the contract, unless with the other machinery mentioned in the contract it gives to that vessel a speed of about 9\u00bd knots an hour.\u00a0 Therefore, the specifications contained in the contract are not complied with until the vessel shall have received from the machinery installed a speed of about 9\u00bd knots an hour.\u00a0 The word \"suitable\" is perfectly definite and clear in its meaning and its reference is undoubted.<br\/><br\/>The defendant, in the contract, not only agrees to furnish a propeller 8 feet in diameter and of brass, but also agrees to furnish a propeller with certain other characteristics, among them\u00a0 being a <i>pitch suitable to produce a certain speed in a certain vessel<\/i>.\u00a0 If the pitch of the propeller was suitable to do that, it\u00a0 would do it.\u00a0 The failure of the propeller to give a speed anything like 9\u00bd knots an hour indicates clearly and beyond question that the pitch of the propeller was not suitable for the purposes specified in the contract.<br\/><br\/>The contention of the defendant is, further, that the pitch of the propeller as furnished, viz, 15\u00bd feet, was suitable to give a speed of more than 9\u00bd knots an hour; and in its argument it quotes the expert, Swann, who testifies, in relation to the pitch of the propeller, that with the pitch of 15\u00bd feet the propeller would have a speed of a little over 11 knots per hour.\u00a0 The defect in this contention is that a propeller has no such quality as speed; that the thing which Swann figures out as 11 knots an hour is not speed but pitch.\u00a0 A propeller has, aside from the material of its construction, three qualities-diameter, area, and pitch.\u00a0 A propeller has no such quality as speed.\u00a0 The pitch of the propeller is described by Swann and Gilchrist as the distance which it would travel if it were turned one revolution in a substance which, although yielding sufficiently to permit the passage of the propeller, would admit of no slip.\u00a0 In other words, if a propeller, were immersed in\u00a0 wax and then given a turn amounting to one revolution, the pitch of the propeller would be the distance which it would travel through the wax in that one revolution.\u00a0 The expert Swann says that the way to determine the speed of a propeller is to \"take the pitch, multiply it by the revolutions, which would give me the distance the propeller would advance in any one minute; then multiply that by sixty, which would give me the amount in one hour; then divide by 6,080, which is the number of feet in a knot, and that would give me the number of knots per hour which the propeller would advance;\" and then says that the speed of the propeller would be more\u00a0 than 11 knots.\u00a0 The mere fact that Swann multiplies the pitch of the propeller by a number of figures, and then divides that product by other figures, does not change pitch into speed.\u00a0 It remains pitch still.\u00a0 In other words, the 11 knots per hour which Swann refers to as the speed of the propeller is the distance which the propeller, unattached to any vessel, would travel, <i>in wax<\/i> in one hour if it was turned\u00a0 at the rate of 84 revolutions per minute.\u00a0 But this is the acknowledged definition of <i>pitch<\/i>, not speed.\u00a0 It is manifestly absurd to contend that the propeller can have a speed independent of the vessel to which it may be attached.\u00a0 Speed is a quality of the vessel itself and not a quality of the propeller.\u00a0 To be sure, the propeller, operated by the engine, is able to <i>give<\/i> speed to the vessel, but in and of itself it <i>has<\/i> no such quality.<br\/><br\/>It is apparent, therefore, that the contention of the defendant that the propeller was so constructed as to have a speed of 11 knots an hour is absurd.\u00a0 In other words, the contention of the defendant is, that a guaranty in a contract to give a ship a speed of 20 knots an hour is complied with if there is furnished to that ship a propeller with a pitch, which, multiplied by certain figures and divided by others, would produce twenty somethings at the conclusion of the calculation, and this absolutely regardless of whether the ship on which the propeller is to be placed is a war ship or a pleasure yacht, whether it is 100 or 1,000 feet long, 10 feet or 100 feet wide, whether it draws 5 feet or 60 feet\u00a0 of water and wholly regardless of the form of the vessel's hull.\u00a0 It is recognized by all authorities upon the construction of steamships that \"the most important point to be considered in propulsive efficiency is the shape of the vessel's hull.\"\u00a0 In respect of speed this is one of the greatest problems and one of the most perplexing with which marine engineers have to deal.\u00a0 The defendant, by its contention, avoids all the trouble of figuring out this difficult problem by simply giving a <i>speed<\/i> to its <i>propeller<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>It was a condition, and not a theory, which confronted the plaintiff\u00a0 when he purchased the machinery in question, including the propeller.\u00a0 He had a vessel which was designed for the coastwise trade and, in order to be useful and efficient in that connection, it was necessary that it should have a speed of about 9\u00bd knots an hour.\u00a0 All of this the defendant knew.\u00a0 Speed being so important in a vessel carrying freight in competition with other vessels having a speed of 9\u00bd knots an hour, the parties placed in the contract a specification by which this vessel should receive machinery of such a character that it would be able to compete with other vessels in a similar occupation.\u00a0 These specifications required that the vessel should have a speed of about 9\u00bd knots per hour and that the machinery furnished for the vessel should be arranged to that end, particularly the propeller.<br\/><br\/>The defendant not only asserts that it furnished a propeller with a speed of more than 9\u00bd knots an hour, but also contends that the reason why the vessel did not have a speed of 9\u00bd knots an hour after the installation of the machinery was because the propeller was, by the construction of the vessel, forced to work in a position where it could not display its properties adequately.\u00a0 To this end, it asserts, through its expert witness Swann, \"that the propeller was, so to speak, too close to both the stern and the rudder posts, so that the propeller could not receive the water or throw it away from it in the manner wanted; that is, in a line with the boat's keel more or less.\u00a0 It could not do anything else because it was practically water-tight, so to speak, that is, to all intents and purposes, water-tight between these two large chocks of timber, the rudder and stern posts, and hence could not throw the water off or receive the water from forward in the manner it should, and hence would throw it sideways; that is the effect.\u00a0 The propeller could not get a chance to work.\"<br\/><br\/>The expert then goes on to assert that the pitch had nothing to do with it, that the diameter of the propeller had nothing to do with it, and that the sole and only reason why the vessel did not receive a speed of 9\u00bd knots an hour from the propeller furnished was because\u00a0 of the sternpost and the rudderpost.<br\/><br\/>It should be noted, however, that, before the contract was signed, the defendant, and its agent, Swann, were furnished with a plan or plans of the hull of the vessel, showing the sternpost and the rudderpost fully and fairly; that Swann had himself inspected the vessel several times at the yard where it was being built and knew all about the said sternpost and rudderpost and their relative locations.\u00a0 Yet, with that plan in his hand and with that knowledge in his head, he, nevertheless, made a contract in which he agreed to\u00a0 furnish a propeller which would give a speed of 9\u00bd knots an hour to that very ship.\u00a0 It must also be remembered that the events proved the contention of the expert Swann to be wholly unfounded when he claimed that the reason why the propeller would not work was because of its position between the sternpost and the rudderpost.\u00a0 The trial of the propeller furnished by the defendant having demonstrated that it was ineffective and that its pitch was too coarse and its area too great for the purposes specified in the contract, the plaintiff placed in the steamship another propeller in exactly the same position in the vessel as the\u00a0 other, i. e., between the sternpost and the rudderpost, with a diameter only 6 inches more than the diameter of the propeller furnished by the defendant, and the vessel immediately attained a speed of 9 knots, or thereabouts, per hour.\u00a0 It is thus apparent that the expert Swann again made a serious mistake in claiming that the failure of speed was due solely to the place in which the propeller worked.<br\/><br\/>The defendant also maintains that the plaintiff ought not to recover in this case because before the propeller was constructed the defendant notified him that a propeller 8 feet in diameter would not produce the results specified in the contract and that in order to attain those results it would be necessary to place in that ship a propeller 10 feet in diameter; that the plaintiff rejected this proposal and refused to accept a propeller of any dimensions diferent from that specified in the contract, and that,\u00a0 therefore, he brought his misfortune on his own head.\u00a0 In reply to this contention it is sufficient to state that, by reason of the construction of the vessel, which Swann knew perfectly before hand, the placing of a propeller 10 feet in diameter in the ship in question would necessitate cutting away a large portion of the rear part of the vessel's hull.\u00a0 The plaintiff was perfectly justified in refusing to change the whole structure of the rear of his vessel in order to accommodate the defendant.\u00a0 His refusal was justified by subsequent events; for, later, as before stated, a propeller 8\u00bd feet in diameter, but of different pitch and area, was placed in the ship, without any change in the construction of the hull, and the vessel immediately attained a speed of 9 knots, or thereabouts, per hour.<br\/><br\/>There seems to be no question that the expert witness for the plaintiff was entirely correct when he stated that the fault of the propeller furnished by the defendant was in its pitch and area.\u00a0 He testified that the pitch of the propeller was too coarse and the area was too great for the kind of vessel in which it was placed.<br\/><br\/>It is thus apparent that the defendant failed to comply with the terms of the contract in respect to the propeller therein described, and the plaintiff, in consequence, is entitled to recover appropriate damages by reason thereof.<br\/><br\/>The damages recoverable of a manufacturer or dealer for the breach of warranty of machinery which he contracts to furnish or place in operation for a known purpose are not confined to the difference in value of the machinery as warranted and as it proves to be, but include such consequential damages as are the direct, immediate, and probable result of the breach.\u00a0 (30 Am. and Eng. Ency. of Law, p. 217, and cases there cited.)<br\/><br\/>The loss of the buyer's time and of that of his laborers resulting from the breach is\u00a0 recoverable where the circumstances of the sale were such as to have put the seller upon notice that such a loss would probably result from a breach.<br\/><br\/>Indemnity for losses and damages includes not only the amount of the loss which may have been suffered, but also that of the profit which the creditor may have failed to realize.\u00a0 (Art. 1106, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>The losses and damages for which a creditor in good faith is liable are those foreseen, or which may have been foreseen, at the time of constituting the obligation, and which may be a necessary consequence of its nonfulfillment.\u00a0 (Art. 1107, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>In an action against a manufacturer or dealer for a breach of warranty upon a sale of goods, which he knew at the time of the sale were intended to be used for a particular purpose, the measure of damages is not limited to the difference in value of the goods as warranted, and as they prove to be, as in cases where like articles are sold as merchandise for general purposes; but profits lost and expenses incurred, because of the breach, may be recovered.\u00a0 (Swain <i>vs.<\/i> Schieffelin, 134 N. Y,, 471; New York and Colorado Mining Syndicate and Company <i>vs.<\/i> Fraser, 130 U. S., 611; Accumulator Company <i>vs.<\/i> Dubuque Street Railway Company, 64 Fed. Rep., 70.)<br\/><br\/>It is apparent from the authorities above cited that the plaintiff is entitled to recover P375, the value of 30 tons of coal consumed\u00a0 in the trials necessarily made to determine whether or not the propeller had the qualities specified in the contract; also the sum of P707, the wages of employees and other necessary expenses incurred during said trials.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff\u00a0 not\u00a0 having presented competent proof as to the loss he sustained by reason of his ship being out of commission during the time intervening between the trial of the first propeller and the installation of the second, nothing can be awarded him as damages in relation thereto.\u00a0 He is, however, entitled to be allowed as damages the sum of P2,770.36, the amount paid by him for the first propeller, as its purchase price, the same being worthless to him for the purpose for which he bought it-said propeller to be and remain the property of the defendant, with the right to retake the same if it has not already done so.<br\/><br\/>The defendant failed to deliver to the plaintiff the following machinery and materials which it agreed to deliver under the contract, which said machinery and materials the plaintiff was obliged to purchase of other parties, paying therefor the following prices, which this court finds reasonable in amount, to wit:<br\/><br\/><blockquote><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"> <tbody><tr> <td width=\"77%\"><div align=\"left\">One brass cock with flange for the

that at the same time the deed was delivered to him; but that it had been stolen from him some three months later.\u00a0 These allegations, if they could be accepted as true, would, of course, finally dispose of plaintiff's cause of action; but the trial judge refused to believe the testimony of the defendant and we do not think his allegations are satisfactorily established by the evidence of record.\u00a0 We do not deem it necessary, however, to make any express findings as to their truth or falsity, and we expressly reserve our opinion on this point, because, wholly disregarding the evidence introduced by the defendant, the judgment of the trial court must be reversed and the complaint must be dismissed, on the ground that the evidence introduced by the plaintiff himself does not establish his right to an accounting.<br\/><br\/>Plaintiff testified that at the time when the contract was entered\u00a0 into and the deed of sale executed, the defendant gave him a promissory note for the purchase price of his interest in the land; that after the deed was acknowledged before the notary, he, the plaintiff, left it in the hands of the notary, and instructed him not to turn it over to the defendant until the promissory note for the purchase price was paid; that defendant failed to pay the note when it became due and payable; that thereafter, on the 22d of March, 1906, he turned over the promissory note (presumably, to the notary) and received in exchange therefore the deed of sale; and that at the same time he executed before the notary a formal instrument wherein he solemnly declared that he rescinded,\u00a0 revoked, and annulled the deed of sale because of defendant's failure to pay the purchase price.<br\/><br\/>The trial judge was of opinion that the sale of the plaintiff's interests was not an absolute sale; that it was conditioned upon the payment of the purchase price; that the purchase price never\u00a0 having been paid, the sale never took effect; and, therefore, that the agreement for the dissolution of the partnership being dependent upon the sale of plaintiff's interests to the defendant,\u00a0 the partnership was never dissolved and plaintiff is entitled to\u00a0 an accounting.<br\/><br\/>But there is no evidence in the record brought to this court which even tends to sustain the finding of the trial judge that the sale was conditioned on the payment of the purchase price.\u00a0 On the contrary, plaintiff's evidence leaves no room for doubt that the conveyance was an absolute and unconditional one.\u00a0 The original deed of sale executed and put in evidence by him, and which contains the terms of the contract of sale as entered into between\u00a0 the parties, expressly and explicitly sets out that the sale evidenced thereby was an absolute and unconditional one; the instrument executed by the plaintiff more than three months after the date of the execution of the deed of sale, wherein he undertook to rescind and annul it, formally recites the fact that the land in question had been conveyed to the defendant <i>\"a titulo de due\u00f1o absoluto\"<\/i> (with the title of absolute ownership); and finally the plaintiff admitted that he took from the defendant a promissory note for the amount of the purchase price at the time when the deed was executed.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff himself, when testifying on the witness stand, did not pretend that he had any agreement with the defendant\u00a0 conditioning the sale upon the payment of the purchase price or of the promissory note therefor; though he evidently thought that by instructing the notary public not to deliver the deed of sale until the promissory note for the purchase price was paid, he could and did secure to himself the right to rescind or annul the contract in the event of defendant's failure to pay the note.\u00a0 But in the absence of an agreement between himself and the defendant, such arbitrary instructions could in no wise affect the nature of the transaction evidenced by the deed of sale.\u00a0 The vendee having\u00a0 delivered, and the vendor having accepted the promissory note for the amount of the purchase price, the sale was thereby consummated, and the vendee had he desired so to do could have compelled the plaintiff to make delivery of the property sold without awaiting the maturity of the note, and he would have been entirely within his rights had he conveyed the land purchased by him to a third party, immediately after the execution of the deed of conveyance and the delivery and acceptance of the promissory note.\u00a0 (Articles 1457 and 1461, Civil Code; De la Rama <i>vs.<\/i> Sanchez et al., 10 Phil. Rep., 432.)\u00a0 It is very clear, therefore, that the failure of the notary public to deliver the deed of sale, in pursuance of plaintiff's arbitrary and unauthorized instructions not to do so, could not and did not defeat the absolute and unconditional character of the conveyance of the property described therein.\u00a0 And, of course, his attempt, by his own act and deed, without the consent of the defendant, to dissolve, rescind, and annul the contract was, therefore, absolutely void and of no effect.<br\/><br\/>The contract of sale of the plaintiff's interest in the property in question being still in full force and effect, and that contract, by agreement of parties, having terminated the partnership which existed between them prior to its execution, and constituting at the same time an agreed settlement of the respective interests of the partners, plaintiff has no right to an accounting, and his action should, therefore, be dismissed.<br\/><br\/>It has been suggested that the trial judge may have based his finding that the title to the property in question did not pass to the defendant because of his failure to pay the promissory note given for the purchase price, upon a deposition of the notary public, which appears to have been submitted in the court below, but which does not appear in the record brought to this court; and it is said that the trial court was perfectly justified in doing so, if from that deposition it appeared that by express agreement between plaintiff and defendant, made at the time of the execution of the deed of sale or immediately thereafter, it was understood that the deed should not be delivered and that title to the property should not pass until the purchase price had been paid.<br\/><br\/>We do not question the right of the parties to enter into such an agreement, nor that such an agreement, duly entered into, would sustain a finding that the sale was conditioned upon the payment of the purchase price, so that the title to the property sold would not pass until the purchase price had been paid; but we do not deem it necessary to impose upon the parties the additional burden of expense and delay involved in correcting1 the alleged omission from the record of the deposition of the notary, because we are satisfied that the mere oral testimony of this witness, that the parties had entered into such an agreement, would not be sufficient, in itself, to establish the existence of such an agreement, in view of the other evidence of record, to wit, first, the solemn recital of the fact that the sale was an absolute and unconditional one, contained in the deed itself and in the above-mentioned instrument executed three months later by the plaintiff, wherein he undertook to rescind and annul the sale; second, the fact that a promissory note was given and accepted for the amount of the purchase price; and, third, that the plaintiff himself made no reference whatever to the existence of such an agreement in his testimony, although he undertook to testify to all that occurred between himself and the defendant in connection with the transaction.<br\/><br\/>Ten days from the date hereof let judgment be entered reversing the judgment of the court below, without costs to either party in this instance, and twenty days thereafter let the record be returned to the court below, where judgment will be entered in\u00a0 accordance herewith.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

The plaintiff sues as administratrix of the estate of her mother, Simona Cabrera, who died some years ago.  She has no documentary title whatever and relies upon the testimony of witnesses to the effect that her mother was in possession of the land until about 1882, when she was ousted by an order of the court and  possession of the premises was taken by Jose M. Perez Rubio.  The defendant shows title in herself and her minor children by inheritance from her deceased husband, Jose  M. Perez Rubio, under a contract of distribution among his heirs.  It appears also upon the defendant's showing that said Jose M. Perez Rubio acquired title by a conveyance executed by the Court of Quiapo on the 21st day of December, 1881, and that, immediately upon said conveyance, he entered into possession of the property and he and his heirs have continued in possession thereof under claim of ownership, publicly, peacefully, and without interruption, down to the time of the commencement of this action.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff contends that the possession  of Jose M. Perez Rubio of the land in question was not in good faith, as required by law, and assigns as a reason for that contention that, subsequent to the conveyance mentioned, the opponent of Rubio made an application to the court in the action in which said conveyance was obtained asking that the cause be reheard and that the order of said court which was the basis of said conveyance be suspended until the cause could be retried; that, pursuant to such application, said cause was reopened and said order and its operation were suspended; that nothing further was done in said action by either party, and that, therefore, the effect of the order of conveyance having been annulled by a suspension of the same and the reopening of the case for a rehearing, Rubio had no proper title or color thereof when he took possession of said land, and he, therefore, continued in possession knowing the defect in his title; and that said Rubio, being himself a lawyer, can not be heard to plead ignorance to protect his possession from the taint of bad faith.<br\/><br\/>We find, however, that it is not necessary to discuss or decide that question because the defendant in this action claims ownership of said land not only  by virtue of the possession and rights therein of her husband, Rubio, but also by virtue of her own  personal occupancy and possession of the same for more than 10 years, in good faith and just title, basing the same upon inheritance from her husband and a contract of distribution among his heirs under which she was awarded the land in question.<br\/><br\/>Article 1957 of the Civil Code provides that ownership and other property rights in real property shall prescribe by possession for ten years as to persons present, and for twenty years with regard to those absent, with good faith and with proper title.  Article 1950 of the same code provides that good faith of the possessor consists in his belief that the person from whom he received the thing was the owner of the same and could convey his title.  Article 433 provides that any person who is not aware  that there is in his title or in the manner of acquiring it any flaw invalidating the same shall be considered a possessor in good faith.  Article 434 provides that good faith is always presumed and any person alleging bad faith on the part of the possessor is obliged to prove it.  That defendant has been possessing since 1896 under a proper title, as defined by law, is undoubted.  It is equally unquestioned that the defendant has been occupying and possessing in good faith unless the  alleged bad faith on the part of her husband can be imputed to her.   Article 442  of the Civil Code provides that a person inheriting by hereditary title shall not suffer the consequences of faulty possession of the testator unless it is proved that he had knowledge of the defects affecting it.  There being no proof in the record that the defendant had knowledge of the defects, if  any, in the title of her husband, the question of good faith upon his part in possessing such land  is of no consequence in the  decision of this case.  The defendant, having taken possession of the land in dispute  on the 15th day of February, 1896, in  good faith and with a proper title, and having publicly, peacefully and uninterruptedly possessed  the same down to the date on which this action was commenced, viz., October 17, 1908, it is evident that the defendant is the owner of said land by virtue of prescription.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below is, therefore, affirmed, with costs against the appellant.

I., while a bonded public official of the Province of Albay, that is to say, deputy provincial treasurer of the Island of Catanduanes, Albay Province, P. I., had, under his care, charge, and responsibility, on account of his office and position, public funds and moneys and funds on deposit which the law provided should be in the custody of said official.<br\/><br\/>\"That the said accused, then and there, maliciously, voluntarily, and criminally, and for the purpose of enriching himself, took, seized, removed, and misappropriated from the moneys and public funds which, on account of his public office and position he held under his care and charge, the sum of two thousand seven hundred and thirteen pesos and sixty-eight centavos (P2,713.68), Philippine currency, using and employing same to his personal ends, contrary to law.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>The witnesses for the prosecution proved, and indeed the accused himself admitted, that on the 17th day of September, 1908, the district auditor, who examined the accounts of the accused, as deputy treasurer of the subprovince of Catanduanes, found him short in his funds in the sum of P2,713.68 Philippine currency.\u00a0 In explanation of this shortage, the accused swore that in the month of December, 1907, he lost public funds in his hands as deputy treasurer, amounting to P2,415, in a shipwreck which took place while he was traveling through his province upon official business, and that he also lost public funds amounting to P1,045 in another shipwreck which took place under similar conditions in the month of May, 1908.\u00a0 The trial judge was of opinion that this explanation of the admitted shortage of public funds for which the accused was responsible by virtue of his office, was false and wholly unworthy of belief; partly because of the inherent\u00a0 improbability of the story of these two shipwrecks as related by the accused upon the witness stand; partly because of the unsatisfactory and unconvincing manner in which he and the witnesses whom he called to corroborate him testified; and partly because of the fact that he made no report of his loss of public funds until his shortage was discovered by the auditor of accounts.\u00a0 Upon an examination of the whole record, we are of opinion\u00a0 that the evidence fully sustains this finding of the trial court, and that the guilt of the accused of the misappropriation of public funds, in violation of the provisions of Act No. 1740, is proven by the evidence of record beyond a reasonable doubt, it appearing that he has failed to account for public funds to the amount set out in the information, which admittedly came into his hands in his official capacity as deputy treasurer of the subprovince of Catanduanes.\u00a0 (U.

the said land is situated in the barrio of Palayan of the town of Lumbang, Province of La Laguna, its boundaries and extension being described in the complaint; that on\u00a0 or about the afternoon of the aforesaid 30th of June the defendants Gaza and Austria began the usurpation of the land under the pretext that the defendant Tabia had delivered it to them for the purpose of cultivation; that the plaintiff, on making the\u00a0 repurchase, had undertaken to allow other persons to cultivate the land and that he will therefore suffer serious damages if he is not allowed to take possession so that said land may be cultivated by the said third persons; that then was the time to commence work in the fields in that barrio, so that if he were not able to cultivate his land at that time he would lose all the crop of that agricultural year; that the land produced a yearly crop of about 40 or 45 <i>cavanes<\/i> of rice; that the defendants had been requested to turn over the land in question but that they had failed to do so and actually continue to retain and cultivate it.\u00a0\u00a0 For these reasons the plaintiff prayed the court to order the defendants to deliver him the possession of the aforesaid land, to prevent them from cultivating it and from disturbing the plaintiff in the possession and cultivation thereof, and that during the\u00a0 pendency of the suit the defendants be restrained from working said land and disturbing the plaintiff and his associates in their labor, and to this end offered to furnish the bond attached.<br\/><br\/>The defendants, on September 4 of that year, presented a demurrer to the complaint on the ground that the court had no jurisdiction over the subject-matter of\u00a0 the action; that there was a defect or misjoinder of parties defendant; that the complaint did not set forth facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action; that the same was vague, ambiguous, and unintelligible, and that there was another action pending between the same parties for the same cause before the said court; the defendants objected to the order of the court of August 31, entered in the record, and prayed that they be acquitted of the complaint with the costs against the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>By an order dated October 13, 1906, the court below overruled the said demurrer, to which order the defendants duly excepted.<br\/><br\/>The defendants, with the exception of Wenceslao Tabia, that is, Miguel Gaza, Felix Gaza, and Eusebio de Austria, filed their answer to the complaint on October 17, 1906, in which they denied each and all the specific allegations contained in said complaint and, as a special defense, alleged:\u00a0 That the land\u00a0 described in the complaint is a communal property belonging <i>pro indiviso<\/i> to Atanasio Pandaquila, the plaintiff, Fernanda Pandaquila, widow of the late Candido Gaza, and Francisca Pandaquila, the two latter having the right to the legal possession thereof; that the defendants Miguel and Felix Gaza are the sons of Fernanda Pandaquila and nephews of Francisca Pandaquila; that Eusebio de Austria is the son-in-law of Fernanda Pandaquila; that these defendants were in possession of the land merely as associates and representatives of the aforesaid Fernanda and Francisca Pandaquila, for which reason they prayed the court to absolve them from the complaint with the costs against the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>The defendant Wenceslao Tabia, in his answer to the complaint, alleged that he had no interest, real or substantial, in the land in controversy, or in the determination of the question as to whether said land should or should not be declared to be the property of the plaintiff, and therefore asked that he be acquitted of the\u00a0 complaint with the costs against the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>On August 22, the plaintiff filed a motion asking the court to dismiss the prayer of the defendants as to the payment of costs by him, and also asked that his complaint be understood to be amended as follows:\u00a0 That the part of the petition which reads:\u00a0 \"That during the pendency of the suit the defendants be restrained from cultivating the land and disturbing the plaintiff and his associates in their labor, for which purpose he furnished the attached bond,\" be substituted by the words:\u00a0 \"That the defendants be sentenced to pay the plaintiff P150 as value of the crop for the agricultural year above referred to.\"\u00a0 His petition was admitted without objection on the part of the defendants.<br\/><br\/>The case was heard On August 5, 1907.\u00a0 Both parties submitted their respective proofs, and the exhibits were attached to the record.\u00a0 The court\u00a0 refused to admit as evidence the four land-tax receipts presented by the defendants for the purpose of proving the ownership and right to possession on the part of the defendant Miguel Gaza, for the reason that such documents were not title deeds in favor of said defendants.\u00a0 The latter, on being informed of the ruling of the court, duly excepted thereto.\u00a0 On December 29, 1907, judgment was entered sentencing the defendants to deliver the land in question to the plaintiff, to pay the latter 95 <i>cavanes<\/i> of rice or the value thereof, and to the payment of the costs of the suit.\u00a0 To this judgment the defendants excepted.<br\/><br\/>By a motion dated February 8, 1908, the defendants stated that neither they nor their counsel had been notified of the decision of the court until February 4, 1908, on which date said counsel received a letter from the clerk of court, informing him that he had been notified of the final judgment on the 3d or 4th of January, 1908, and therefore the defendants excepted to the decision in the case.<br\/><br\/>On February 10,1908, counsel for defendants asked that said judgment be annulled and that a new trial be ordered, with the immediate suspension of the order of\u00a0 the court issued on the 5th of that month for the execution of the judgment, during the pendency of the suit, alleging that said judgment was contrary to law and that the findings of fact were manifestly contrary to the weight of the evidence, the motion being accompanied by an affidavit of the attorney-at-law, Pedro G. Paraiso, as well as by affidavits by each of the defendants, 'wherein they allege that they had not received trustworthy information of the decision entered in the case until February 8, 1908, on which date they were notified thereof by the attorney Paraiso.\u00a0 By an order of the 11th of the same month, the execution of the above-mentioned judgment was stayed under a bond of P2,000 filed by the defendants.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff, in his turn, on February 25, presented a motion objecting to the admission of the bill of exceptions on the ground that it was improper and was filed after the time fixed by law for its preparation had more than expired, and he asked that the judgment be declared final and that the execution be accomplished, and, in the event that the court should not grant the motion, that the bill of exceptions be amended by making the proceedings mentioned in paragraph 3 of his petition part thereof.<br\/><br\/>On March 10,1908, the court approved the bill of exceptions with the amendments proposed by appellee, and ordered it forwarded to the clerk of this court, holding that it was beyond the jurisdiction of the court to decide the question of law raised by the appellee as to the admissibility of the appeal presented by the appellants.<br\/><br\/>By another order, which must have been of April 6, the court below overruled the motion for a new trial filed by the defendants on February 10, 1908, to which ruling counsel for defendants duly excepted.<br\/><br\/>The following are indisputable facts admitted and acknowledged by the contending parties:\u00a0 That the land in question was the property of the late Lucio Pandaquila, father of the plaintiff Atanasio and of Francisca and Fernanda, all of the surname of Pandaquila, the two last being the antecessors of the defendants Gaza and Austria; and that the said deceased, during his lifetime, parted with the land first to Anton Patalim, and later to other parties, so that the plaintiff, on returning to his town after an absence of several years in the military service of the former sovereignty, in order to recover said land, was obliged to repurchase it from the spouses named Jacob and Salvadora, who were then in possession of the land as the owners thereof.<br\/><br\/>The land having been recovered, plaintiff in his turn sold it under <i>pacto de retro<\/i> to Wenceslao Tabia, from whom he repurchased iton June 30, 1906; but Tabia, in spite of having received the price of the repurchase, did not return the land to the purchaser, but, on the same date on which the repurchase took place, delivered to and permitted the defendants Miguel and Felix Gaza and Eusebio de Austria to take possession of the land, thereby failing to comply with the obligation contracted with the plaintiff who had paid him the repurchase price.<br\/><br\/>During the trial of the case, and at the time of making his sworn statement, Atanasio Pandaquila, in order to prove that he it was who had sold the land in litigation to Wenceslao Tabia and afterwards repurchased it\u00a0 for the sum of P340,. presented in court the document marked \"A,\" executed by Tabia.\u00a0 The latter immediately acknowledged the authenticity of said document, as well as the signature appearing at the foot as being his own.\u00a0 That document was written in Tagalog, the translation of which appears on the following page and is of the following tenor:<br\/><blockquote>\"I, the undersigned, Wenceslao Tabia, hereby declare that I\u00a0 have received from Atanasio Pandaquila the sum of three hundred and forty pesos, as the redemption price of the land in Palayan which he mortgaged to me.\u00a0 The instrument of mortgage was burnt, so that I could not deliver it to him.\u00a0 I also declare that of the sum of three hundred and forty pesos, which is the price of the redemption, three hundred pesos only is the amount of the mortgage, and that the sum of forty pesos is an increase, for which reason the redemption price amounted to three hundred and forty pesos.\u00a0 In witness whereof I sign.\u00a0 Lumban, June 30,1906.\u00a0 (Sgd.)\u00a0 Wenceslao Tabia.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>With this translation the counsel for defendants does not at all agree, and on appeal presented another translation of said Tagalog document, which is of the following tenor :<br\/><blockquote>\"I, the\u00a0 undersigned, Wenceslao Tabia, hereby declare that I have received from Atanasio Pandaquila the sum of three hundred and forty pesos, as the redemption price of the land in Palayan which he mortgaged to me (<i>isinanla<\/i>).\u00a0 The instrument of mortgage was burnt, so that I could not deliver it to him.\u00a0 I also declare\u00a0 that of the sum of three hundred and forty pesos, which is the amount of the redemption, three hundred pesos only is the amount of the mortgage, and that the sum of forty pesos is an increase asked by them (<i>paragdag nila<\/i>), for which reason the redemption price amounted to three hundred and forty pesos.\u00a0 In witness whereof I have signed.\u00a0 Wenceslao Tabia.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Although this difference exists between the translations, in the first of which is omitted the translation of the Tagalog word <i>nila<\/i> and in the second, the same word is translated as by them, the truth is that the plaintiff Atanasio Pandaquila was the one who mortgaged or sold the said land under <i>pacto de retro<\/i> to Wenceslao Tabia and was also the only one who redeemed it, by paying the sum of P340, as appears in the document, Exhibit A, above referred to, without any intervention on the part of his sisters Francisca and Fernanda, or of other relatives who might have an interest in said land.<br\/><br\/>Whatever hereditary rights the above-mentioned sisters may have to the land derived from their father, such rights can always be enforced against any coheir or coowner, but in no manner could they be an obstacle to compliance by Wenceslao Tabia, who resold the land to the man who had previously sold it to him under <i>pacto de retro<\/i>, with the obligation to deliver to the endor Atanasio Pandaquila the and repurchased or redeemed.<br\/><br\/>Article 1461 of the Civil Code provides that a vendor is bound to deliver and warrant the thing which is the object of the sale.\u00a0 Article 1462 also provides that a thing sold shall be considered as delivered when it is placed in the hands and possession of the vendee.\u00a0 Wenceslao Tabia, far from complying with this obligation, violated the law governing it and delivered the redeemed land to third persons who, it seems, were his former associates in the land, and who, of course, are unable to show title and have no rights whatever thereto.\u00a0 As the sisters of the plaintiff, Francisca and Fernanda, are living, and even though they have certain rights in the land in question, yet the sons and son-in-law of one of them, i. e., the defendants Miguel and Felix Gaza and Eusebio Austria, can have no right to the possession of the land, and the fact that they retain it in connivance with the purchaser Wenceslao Tabia, makes them but mere usurpers and unlawful detainers of property which does not belong to them and to which they have absolutely no rights.\u00a0 Article 1510 of the Civil Code provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"The vendor may bring his action\u00a0 against every possessor whose right arises from that of the vendee, even though in the second contract no mention should have been made of the conventional redemption; without prejudice to the provisions of the Mortgage Law with regard to third persons.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In accordance with the foregoing legal provision the plaintiff, Atanasio, as the vendor of the land, is entitled to bring suit against every possessor whose right arises or is derived from any that the purchaser Wenceslao Tabia may have had, and with still greater right can such an action be brought against those who occupy the land by means of illegal actions on the part of said Tabia.\u00a0 It is unnecessary for us to deal with the question as to whether the defendants herein should be considered as the third parties referred to in the Mortgage Law, inasmuch as they do not show nor allege any right duly recorded in the registry of property.<br\/><br\/>If the plaintiff\u00a0 Atanasio Pandaquila complied with his obligation\u00a0 by paying to Tabia the redemption price, as proven by the document executed and signed by the first purchaser, Wenceslao Tabia, it is just and equitable that the latter, in his turn, should comply with the unavoidable obligation to deliver the thing redeemed to the person who paid the redemption price, without prejudice to the right of those who consider themselves entitled to the ownership of said land, which would not have been returned to the possession of the plaintiff if lie had not redeemed it.<br\/><br\/>From the foregoing considerations the conclusion is that the judgment appealed from should be affirmed, except in so far as it refers to the restitution of 95 <i>cavanes<\/i> of rice, or the value thereof, on account of lack of sufficient evidence upon which to base a finding to that effect, with the understanding, however, that in the decision confirming the judgment of the lower court there must necessarily be included the overruling of the motion filed by the counsel for appellants in this instance, asking leave to amend the complaint so as to include therein, as parties defendant, the above-mentioned Fernanda and Francisca Pandaquila, because the confirmation of the judgment appealed by the defendants involves the holding that its reversal and the acquittal of said defendants be denied, as also the amendment to the complaint is considered improper for the reasons above stated and because there is no legal provision which authorizes its admission under the circumstances.\u00a0 In affirming the judgment it is not possible to grant the motion to amend the complaint; on the contrary, it must necessarily be understood that said motion is denied.<br\/><br\/>By virtue of the foregoing considerations the assignment of errors\u00a0 imputed to the judgment appealed\u00a0 from were answered or refuted; and with regard to the jurisdiction of the judge who tried the suit in the court below, it appears that said judge, Mr. Cui, heard this and other cases of the court of La Laguna by virtue of express authority of the Executive, and entered the judgment therein according to the provisions of Act No. 867.<br\/><br\/>In view, therefore, of the reasons above stated, we are of the opinion that the judgment appealed from should be affirmed, except only in so far as it orders the return of the fruits, or the value thereof, as appears in said judgment, with the costs against the appellants.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

(<i>a<\/i>)\u00a0 Before imported crude opium or imported prepared opium in any of its forms shall be released from the custom-house, there shall be paid thereon an internal-revenue tax as follows:\u00a0 On crude opium, two pesos and fifty centavos a kilo, net weight; and on prepared opium seven pesos and fifty centavos a kilo, net weight.\u00a0 This tax shall be paid to the Collector of Customs, under regulations prescribed by the Collector of Internal Revenue, with the approval of the head of the proper department.<br\/><br\/>\"Before any crude opium which is in the Philippine Islands at the time this Act shall become effective is cooked or prepared for sale or for human consumption or use, every wholesale dealer shall pay on such crude opium to the Collector of Internal Revenue, or his duly authorized representative, an internal-revenue tax of two pesos and fifty centavos per kilo, net weight.\u00a0 <i>On opium cooked or prepared in the Philippine Islands for sale or for human consumption or use, every wholesale dealer shall pay on the removal, or withdrawal of such opium from the place in which it is lawfully kept or stored, to the Collector of Internal Revenue, or his duly authorised representative, an internal-revenue tax of five pesos on each kilo<\/i>, net weight.\u00a0 The burden of proving that the internal-revenue tax hereby imposed has been paid is imposed on the wholesale dealer:\u00a0 <i>Provided however<\/i>, That no tax shall be paid on opium removed or withdrawn for exportation and actually exported and not relanded in the Philippine Islands.<br\/><br\/>\"All opium in the possession, or under the control, or subject to the order or disposition of any retail dealer at the time this Act becomes effective on which the internal-revenue tax provided by this Act has not been paid by a wholesale dealer, shall be subject to such tax, and said retail dealer shall pay on such opium before manufacture, sale, consumption, or use thereof, an internal-revenue tax, as follows: Crude opium, two pesos and fifty centavos for each kilo, net weight; cooked or prepared opium, or opium prepared for human consumption or use, five pesos for each kilo, net weight.\u00a0 The burden of proving that such internal-revenue tax has been duly paid is hereby imposed on the retail dealer.\u00a0 Net weight shall be determined by the customs rules and regulations covering the importation of opium into the Philippine Islands.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It is claimed by counsel that any interpretation of the law other than that adopted by the trial court would work inequality, inasmuch as the aggregate tax of P7.50 paid by the dealer preparing or cooking the opium in the Islands would exceed the tax of P7.50 paid by the, importer of the prepared article, by reason of the shrinkage in course of preparation of the bulk of the crude drug, claimed to amount to about one-seventh of the whole; that one purpose of the law, to favor the preparation of the drug within the Islands rather than outside, would thus be hindered; and that the first paragraph of section 20 providing for the tax on crude opium in the Islands at the time of the going into effect of the Act is supplemented by the second part which embraces only cooked opium in the Islands on the same date and consequently does not include such opium as might be cooked at any time thereafter, so that in effect the words \"at the time this Act shall become effective,\" which we find in the first sentence of the second paragraph must be understood as if repeated after the words \"Philippine Islands\" in the second sentence thereof.<br\/><br\/>The trial judge in his opinion says:<br\/><blockquote>\"By the provisions of this section we clearly have fixed as a tax upon crude opium at the time of its importation the sum of P2.50 per kilo, and on prepared opium the sum of P7.50 per kilo; upon crude opium in the hands of retail dealers the sum of P2.50 per kilo, and on cooked or prepared opium in the hands of retail dealers the sum of P5 per kilo; and crude opium in the possession of wholesale dealers in the Philippine Islands at the time the Act became effective the sum of P2.50.<br\/><br\/>\"This accounts for all classes of opium unless it be prepared opium which was imported into the Philippine Islands as such prior to the passage of the Act, and was at the time the Act became effective in the hands of whole-sale dealers.<br\/><br\/>\"If the contention of the Government, that the provision of said section which provides for a tax of P5 upon opium 'cooked or prepared in the Philippine Islands for sale or for human consumption or use' upon removal or withdrawal of the same from the place in which it was kept, be well made-that is, that the provision refers to opium which has been or shall be cooked or prepared in the Philippine Islands from crude opium-then there is no provision for a tax upon the prepared opium which was in the Philippine Islands in the hands of wholesale dealers at the time the Act went into effect.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>We do not think this consequence follows the construction of the Act contended for by the Government, which is to the effect that the other provisions of the Act reach all classes of opium whether crude or prepared, and whether in the hands of wholesale or retail dealers, except cooked opium in the hands of wholesalers prepared either before or after the law went into effect, that it is reasonable, therefore, to infer that this section was designed to reach both of these classes otherwise untouched rather than only one of them and that this purpose is fully met by the natural construction of the words of the section without the interpolation of any understood phrase, inasmuch as the words \"opium cooked or prepared in the Philippine Islands for sale or for human consumption or use\" naturally apply to the cooking or preparation without respect to a particular date.<br\/><br\/>It is further urged that the inequality resulting from this construction is much Jess than that which would follow from subjecting cooked opium, imported as such, to a tax of P7.50 and the similar article, imported in the crude state and afterwards cooked to only the original tax of P2.50 without the additional P5, there existing no reason for such a wide difference in the duty upon the two classes of cooked opium which is of the same quality, is destined to the same use and is of equal commercial value.<br\/><br\/>In the interpretation of this as well as of some other sections of the opium law it is impossible to satisfactorily harmonize its complicated and sometimes perplexing provisions so that it becomes the duty of the courts to choose between conflicting theories that which best accords with the letter of the law and with its purpose.\u00a0 In the construction of the paragraph of section 20 under discussion, we are satisfied that the weight of argument both as to the natural interpretation of the words of the law and as to its reasonable effect lies with the Government, and, therefore, the decision of the Court of First Instance is hereby reversed, judgment to be entered in favor of the defendant-appellant, without costs of this instance.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

That upon the 31st day of August, 1903, the plaintiff commenced an action in the Court of First instance of the city of Manila against the defendants, Francisco Gambe, Manuel Perez, Anronio Herranz, alid Florencio Garriz, who constitute the commercial firm of Herranz &amp; Garriz, for the purpose of recovering the sum of five thousand dollars ($5,000), United States currency, for certain damages occasioned by the steamship <i>Alfred<\/i> to the \"Spanish Bridge\" in the city of Manila.<br\/><br\/>Second.\u00a0 After a consideration of the facts adduced during the trial, the Honorable Judge Rohde, then one of the judges of the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, rendered a judgment against the said Francisco Gambe, for the sum of $1,300, United States currency, and for the costs.<br\/><br\/>Third.\u00a0 Francisco\u00a0 Gambe was a pilot and a member of the Pilots' Association of Manila and was at the time of the alleged accident and injury in charge of the said steamship <i>Alfred<\/i>. Judge Rohde dismissed the cause as to the other defendants.<br\/><br\/>Fourth.\u00a0 From this judgment of the lower court the defendant Gambe appealed to the Supreme Court.<br\/><br\/>Fifth.\u00a0 After a consideration of the facts, the Supreme Court on the 31st day of March, 1906, affirmed with costs the judgment of the lower court.\u00a0 (See City of Manila <i>vs.<\/i> Gambe, 6\u00a0 Phil. Rep., 49.)<br\/><br\/>Sixth.\u00a0 The judgment thus affirmed was returned to the lower court for an execution of the same.<br\/><br\/>Seventh.\u00a0 On the 26th day of May, 1906, an execution was issued upon the said judgment against the said defendant, Francisco Gambe, and was returned upon the 23d day of June, 1906, unsatisfied.<br\/><br\/>Eighth.\u00a0 Later, upon the 11th day of July, 1906, another execution was issued out of the Court of First Instance against the defendant, Francisco Gambe, which was returned upon the 17th day of August, 1906, unsatisfied.<br\/><br\/>Ninth.\u00a0 On the same day, or the 11th day of July, 1906, in accordance with the provisions of section 431' of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions, the plaintiff attempted to attach whatever money or effects which the defendant had in the said Pilots' Association of Manila.\u00a0 These attachments were directed to the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, the Hon. W. Morgan Shuster, Collector of Customs, as well as Francisco Aguado, who was the chief of the said Pilots' Association.<br\/><br\/>Tenth.\u00a0 On the 22d day of August, 1906, the attorney for the plaintiff presented in the lower court the following affidavit:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"Edmond Block, being duly sworn, says;<br\/><br\/>\"That\u00a0 he is the attorney for the plaintiff in the above-entitled action.<br\/><br\/>\"That a judgment was duly entered and docketed in the said action in\u00a0 the said court on the 20th day of April, 1906, for the sum of thirteen hundred dollars ($1,300), United States currency, and costs, against the above-named defendant, in favor of the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>\"That an execution upon said judgment was duly issued against the property of said judgment debtor.<br\/><br\/>\"That the said judgment debtor now resides in the said city of Manila.<br\/><br\/>\"That the sheriff of the city of Manila has returned said execution wholly unsatisfied, and that the said judgment still remains wholly unpaid.<br\/><br\/>\"That affiant is informed and believes that an organization or association known as the 'Manila Pilots' Association of which Francisco Aguado is the chief pilot, Manuel Goitia is the treasurer and custodian of its funds, and of which W. Morgan Shuster, Francisco Gambe, and other pilots of the port of Manila are members, has property in its possession dedicated to and for the purpose of payment of damages caused through negligence of the pilots of said association, or any of them, to third persons.<br\/><br\/>\"That the said association has in its possession and under its control, property of the said judgment debtor, exceeding eight hundred pesos (P800), Philippine currency, and is indebted to the said judgment debtor in an amount exceeding eight hundred pesos (P800), Philippine currency.<br\/><br\/>\"That the said indebtedness to said judgment debtor arose through this, that the said judgment debtor has deposited with the said association the said amount exceeding eight hundred pesos (P800), Philippine currency, and that the said association now holds the\u00a0 said amount subject to the order of said judgment debtor, and that\u00a0 the said amount should be applied, affiant believes, to the payment or satisfaction of the judgment debtor.<br\/><br\/>\"That on the 23d day of June and 11th of July, 1906, the said Pilots' Association, through the chief pilot, the treasurer of\u00a0 said association, W.

Morgan Shuster are members of said association, and that it is proper cause for this order, I, the undersigned, judge of the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, Philippine Islands, do hereby order the said Francisco Aguado, Francisco Gambe, Manuel Goitia, and W. Morgan Shuster personally to appear before me in the said city of Manila, on the 10th day of September, at 10 o'clock in the morning of that day, to answer concerning the said property.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>Eleventh.\u00a0 In accordance with the above order, the said parties appeared before the said court and testified relating to the money property, credits or effects which the said Pilots' Association had in its possession belonging to the said defendants.<br\/><br\/>After hearing the evidenced these parties, the said Hon. A. S. Crossfield rendered\u00a0 the following judgment:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"This case is now before the court for hearing the order directing Francisco Aguado as chief pilot, Manuel Goitia as treasurer, and Francisco Gambe and W. Morgan Shuster as members of the Pilots'\u00a0 Association to answer as to any property they may have in their possession or under their control, belonging to the defendant, Francisco Gambe.\u00a0 Execution having been issued in the above-entitled action and the above-named respondents having been attached, as in garnishee proceedings, all of the above-named respondents appeared and the two first-named made declarations as to the property in their hands.<br\/><br\/>\"From the declaration made it appears:<br\/><br\/>\"That each member of the Pilots' Association before becoming such, must deposit with the association the sum of P800, to be retained by the association for the purpose of satisfying damages which may be incurred by others by reason of negligence or fault on the part of the association in the transaction of its business.<br\/><br\/>\"It further appears from the declarations that persons thus depositing the money could not withdraw it; that it is property of the association and may not be withdrawn, even in case of the death of a member, and that said Francisco Gambe is a member.<br\/><br\/>\"I therefore find that the above-named respondents, either as officers of the association or members thereof, have not in their control, nor do they possess any property, money, or effects which would be the subject of a levy under execution against said Gambe, and the order to appear is discharged.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>From this decision of the lower court the plaintiff appealed and\u00a0 made the following assignments of error in this court:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"1.\u00a0 The court below erred in deciding that the sum of P800, Philippine currency, deposited by the defendant, Gambe, with the Pilots' Association could not be withdrawn by him: 'that it has become the property of the association, and that the game can not be withdrawn even in the event of the death of a member', and that the said Francisco Gambe is such a member.<br\/><br\/>\"2.\u00a0 The court below erred in deciding that the respondents called upon to appear in this incident 'either as officers of the association or as members thereof, have not under their control nor in their possession any property, money, or goods subject to\u00a0 attachment by reason of an execution against the said Gambe.'<br\/><br\/>\"3.\u00a0 The court below erred in not ordering the respondents, as officers or members of the Pilots' Association, to deliver to the plaintiff, the city of Manila, the P800, Philippine currency, which the said defendant Gambe, against whom the plaintiff has an execution pending for the sum of P2,670, Philippine currency, has in the treasury of the association.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>The only question presented in this court is whether or not the said Pilots' Association had debts, credits, or personal property, not capable of manual delivery, in its possession or under its control, belonging to the defendant.\u00a0 In other words, did said Pilots Association owe to the defendant a debt or have in its possession and under its control credits and other personal property, belonging to the defendant, subject to be attached in accordance with the provisions of said section 431?\u00a0 Section 431 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions provides:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"Debts and credits, and other personal property not capable of manual delivery, shall be attached by leaving with the person owing such debts or having in his possession or under his control such credits and other personal property, a copy of the order of attachment, and a notice that the debts owing by him to the defendant, or the credits and other personal property in his possession or under his control, belonging to the defendant, are attached in pursuance of such order.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>The test whether or not the interests of the defendant, if he has any, in said association may be attached by virtue of said section is whether said Gambe\u00a0 could maintain an action against the said association for the recovery of the specific debt, credit, or personal property.\u00a0 It would seem clear and conclusive that if Gambe himself could not maintain an action against the said association for the recovery of the specific debt, credit, or personal property which the plaintiff here is attempting to get possession of by virtue of the action, that said plaintiff could not recover the same under the form of action adopted by it.\u00a0 If Gambe could successfully maintain an action against the said Pilots' Association for the recovery of a specific sum of money or specific personal property, then, in our opinion, his judgment creditors, or the plaintiff in this case, might also by the procedure provided for under said section 431 maintain the present action, but not otherwise.\u00a0 (Hassie <i>vs.<\/i> God Is With Us Cong., 35 Cal., 378, 386.)<br\/><br\/>We do not believe that a mere equitable or contingent debt, credit, or personal property can be reached by the procedure provided for in said section (431).\u00a0 (Redondo Beach Co. <i>vs.<\/i> Brewer, 101 Cal., 322.)<br\/><br\/>A \"debt,\" as used in said section, means some definite amount of money, ascertained or capable of being ascertained, which may be paid\u00a0 over to the sheriff or the court under an order, while \"<i>credits<\/i>\" and \"personal property\" are something belonging to the defendant, but in possession and under the control of the person attached.\u00a0 (Gow <i>vs.<\/i> Marshall, 90 Cal., 565; Dunsmoor <i>vs.<\/i> Furstenfeldt, 88 Cal., 522.)<br\/><br\/>In our opinion it is also essential that the debt, credit, or the personal property which is attempted to be subjected to the payment of the obligation of the defendant, and which is alleged to be in the possession of the person attached, <i>must exist in some definite and ascertainable form at the time of the attachment<\/i>.\u00a0 Norris <i>vs.<\/i> Burgoyne, 4 Cal,, 409.)<br\/><br\/>The said Pilots' Association is purely a voluntary association of the pilots of the city of Manila.\u00a0 The association is expressly recognized and authorized under the law.\u00a0 No one can become a member of said association who has not shown special qualifications as a pilot, and no one can act as a pilot who has not been, expressly recommended and approved by the collector of the port of Manila, and no one can become a member of said association who has not been so recommended.\u00a0 Neither can pilot become a member of said association without having paid a certain sum of money into the treasury of said association.\u00a0 This fund becomes the property of the association for the purpose of protecting its members against losses occasioned by its members to <i>ships<\/i> while said ships are under the control of a member or members of said association.\u00a0 The money paid in by one member\u00a0 of said association becomes a part of a general fund of said association, subject to be paid out for damages done to ships by any member of the association.\u00a0 The fund created by the contributions of the members no longer belongs to the members of the association; it belongs to the association.\u00a0 The association has a distinct and separate entity from the individual members who make it up.\u00a0 The fund is created for a specific purpose.\u00a0 (See articles 35, 36, 38, and 39 of the regulations of said association.)\u00a0 Under the regulations of said association it has assumed a certain\u00a0 responsibility for its members.\u00a0 Whether the damage caused by the defendant in this case is of such a character for which the said association assumed the responsibility is a question which the person injured has a right to test in a special action against said association.<br\/><br\/>From the evidence that was adduced before the lower court we are of the opinion, and so hold, that the said association had no debts, credits, or personal property, not capable of manual\u00a0 delivery, in its possession, belonging to the defendant (Gambe), which are subject to be attached in accordance with the provisions\u00a0 of section 431.\u00a0 It is, therefore, hereby ordered that the plaintiff take nothing in this action and that the plaintiff be charged with the costs of both instances.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

of First Instance of Leyte on the 20th day of November, 1908, pursuant to sections 232-240 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions.\u00a0 He was found guilty as charged and was sentenced to pay a fine of P100 and the costs of the proceedings and, in case of nonpayment of the fine within fifteen days, to be imprisoned within the provincial jail for a period of twenty-five days.<br\/><br\/>From that judgment and sentence the defendant appealed to this court, alleging that the court erred in finding that the appellant\u00a0 had failed completely to execute the order of arrest and in finding that the failure of the appellant to execute the order of arrest against one of the persons named therein constituted conduct subversive of the\u00a0 efficient administration of justice.<br\/>The facts are:\u00a0 The accused was deputy sheriff of the Province of Leyte.\u00a0 On the 4th day of November, 1908, an order of arrest was issued by the Court of First Instance of that province against Leona Cabras and Anastacia Cabras in a cause then pending in that court, entitled \"The United States <i>vs.<\/i> Bonifacio Gerilla,\" and placed in the hands of the appellant for execution.\u00a0 The persons named were residents of the municipality of Burauen, Province of Leyte.\u00a0 Said order directed the accused to apprehend and bring before the court the two persons named therein, who had failed to appear after having been duly served with a sub-poena issued from that court in said action.\u00a0 The case mentioned was set for trial on the 4th day of November and was adjourned until the 9th day of November for the sole purpose of allowing the accused sufficient time within which to apprehend the persons named in the order and produce them in court on that day.\u00a0 This the accused knew.\u00a0 The appellant took into custody by virtue of said order one of the persons named therein, but neglected to execute it against the other person.\u00a0 When the case was again called on the 9th of November, the sheriff had made no return upon the order of arrest.\u00a0 The appellant did not at any time between the 4th and the 9th of November make any report or explanation to the court concerning thfe execution of the order of arrest.\u00a0 The excuse offered by the appellant for not executing the order of arrest against the other person mentioned therein is that he was informed by the municipal president and deputy sheriff of the municipality of Burauen that the person named in the order, against whom the samev had not been\u00a0 executed, was sick and unable to attend court.\u00a0 A doctor's certificate to that effect was sent by them to the accused.\u00a0 The appellant did not go to the pueblo of Burauen for the purpose of investigating whether or not the person mentioned was ill, but relied entirely upon the statements of other persons.<br\/><br\/>Section 232 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions provides that an officer of the court who misbehaves in the performance of\u00a0 his official duties or in his official transactions may be punished as for a contempt.<br\/><br\/>It is absolutely essential to the proper administration of justice that courts have full control over the official actions of those through whom the administration of the affairs of the court proceeds.\u00a0 To that end, section 11 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions provides:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"Every court shall have power:<br\/><br\/>*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0

every matter appertaining thereto.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>In the case at bar the appellant failed to perform his full duty in two particulars.\u00a0 In the first place, it was his duty to investigate with great care the alleged illness of Anastacia Cabras and determine to his own satisfaction whether or riot she could be arrested and produced in court on the date specified.\u00a0 This the appellant did not do.\u00a0 Without a careful investigation into the claim of illness made, imposition upon him, and thereby upon the court, was easy, and any designing person, desiring to escape arrest, could easily defy the process of the court and bring the administration of justice into contempt.\u00a0 In the second place, it was his duty, having satisfied himself, if such were the case, that such person could not be brought into court on that day, to lay that fact before the court for the court's information and guidance and then take such advice as to the course of action to be thereupon adopted as the court might see fit to give.\u00a0 The appellant failed and neglected to do either of these things, and, consequently, left the court ignorant of the fact that Anastacia Cabras would not be in court on the 9th, and thereby contributed to, if he did not cause, the miscarriage of justice which resulted from the necessity thus laid upon the court of dismissing the action in\u00a0 which the order was issued.<br\/><br\/>From all the facts in this case this court determines that the defendant was guilty of contempt and punishable accordingly, and affirms the judgment and sentence of the court below.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Sweeney (2 Phil. Rep., 654).\u00a0 The order from which the plaintiff sought to appeal was dated on the 24th of October, 1908, and was an order declaring who the heirs of the deceased were, what participation each had in the\u00a0 property, and assigning it to them in undivided interests.\u00a0 The same order also denied a petition presented by the plaintiff Ortiz, holding that he had no right to intervene in the proceeding.\u00a0 This is the only part of the order which it is necessary to consider.<br\/><br\/>Ortiz claims the right to intervene because he had bought and become the owner of the interest of one of the heirs in the property.\u00a0 The way in which this interest was acquired appears in the case of the estate of Jose Maria Ceballos, Angel Ortiz, appellant<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> (No. 4190, 7 Off. Gaz., 37).<br\/><br\/>We have come to the conclusion that the appeal should have been allowed.\u00a0 Section 783 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Any person legally interested in any other order, decree, or judgment of a Court, of First Instance in the exercise of its jurisdiction in special proceedings in the settlement of the estates of deceased persons, or the administration of guardians and trustees, may appeal to the Supreme Court from such order, decree, or judgment, when such order, decree, or judgment constitutes a final determination of the rights of the parties so appealing, and the appeal shall be effected in the manner provided\u00a0 in the two preceding sections.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The order in question was a final order so far as Ortiz was concerned, because it effectively excluded him from participation in the proceeding relating to the settlement of the estate.\u00a0 As to him no further order would be made in the case.\u00a0 A person who claims the right to intervene in the settlement of the estate of a\u00a0 deceased person and who is denied such a right, is a person legally interested in the order denying him such a right.\u00a0 In holding that the appeal should be allowed, we, of course, make no ruling upon the questions decided by the court below.\u00a0 We do not decide whether or not Ortiz has acquired the rights of Do\u00f1a Matilde Aramburu, one of the heirs, nor do we decide whether, if he has acquired such rights, he has a right to intervene in the proceeding.\u00a0 We simply decide that he has a right to have these questions argued and determined in this court by means of an appeal from the order.<br\/><br\/>In the case of The matter of the estate of Josef a Garcia Pascual<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">(1) <\/sup>(6 Off. Gaz., 1242), this court held that the plaintiff Ortiz had no right to intervene in this proceeding.\u00a0 At that time, however, his standing was only that of a general creditor of the heirs.\u00a0 Since that time he claims to have acquired and become the owner of the interest of one of the heirs of the estate.\u00a0 It is apparent that the resolution of the former case is not necessarily a resolution of the question that will be presented upon the hearing of the appeal.<br\/><br\/>It was suggested upon the argument of the case that mandamus would not lie in this class of cases because there was no legal duty resting in the court to admit the appeal, and that it was not even the duty of the court to fix the amount of the bond.\u00a0 This contention can not, in our opinion, be sustained.\u00a0 Section 783, as has been seen, provides that the appeal shall be taken in the manner provided in the two preceding sections.\u00a0 Section 781 provides that a bond shall be executed and filed as provided in section 780 and section 780 is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Before an appeal is allowed, the person appealing under the two preceding sections shall give a satisfactory bond to the court, conditioned that he will prosecute the appeal to effect and pay the intervening damages and costs occasioned by such appeal.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>This requires, in our opinion, action by the court in fixing the amount of the bond.\u00a0 In refusing to allow the appeal in this case the court necessarily refused to fix the amount of the bond.<br\/><br\/>The demurrer is overruled and the defendants demurring are given five days within which to file their answer.\u00a0 If no answer is presented within that time, judgment will be entered by the clerk, without further order of this court, against these defendants, directing the court to fix the amount of the bond, and upon the giving of a bond satisfactory to the court, it is directed to approve such bond and allow the appeal.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano C.

WORCESTER, DEFENDANTS.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>JOHNSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">This was an original application made in this court, praying for a writ of prohibition against the defendants, to prohibit the Hon. J. C. Jenkins, one of the judges of the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, from proceeding in the trial of the civil cause pending against the plaintiffs herein and from rendering a judgment in said cause against said plaintiffs, and for a preliminary injunction against said defendants, during the pendency of the action in this court.<br\/><br\/>An application for a writ of prohibition in this court in cases like the present is considered an ordinary action and must, therefore, take the course of an ordinary suit brought in this court.  (Enriquez <i>vs.<\/i> Ambler, 2 Phil. Rep., 137; Blanco <i>vs.<\/i> Ambler, 3 Phil. Rep., 358.)<br\/><br\/>The only question, therefore, presented by the petition at this time is whether or not the plaintiffs are entitled to a preliminary injunction.  That is, whether the facts are sufficient to justify this court in restraining the lower court from proceeding with the action pending before it by the extraordinary equitable remedy of injunction.  It will be difficult to discuss the rights of the parties to the preliminary injunction, without at the same time discussing to some extent the question whether or not they would be<br\/>entitled to the writ of prohibition, the principal remedy which the plaintiffs seek in the present petition.<br\/><br\/>From the petition presented, the following facts appear:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>First.  That there was pending in the Supreme Court on appeal a criminal cause for the crime of libel against the plaintiffs herein, Martin Ocampo, Teodoro M. Kalaw, and Fidel A. Reyes.  That the basis of said criminal action was an editorial published in a newspaper called <i>El Renacimiento<\/i>, entitled <i>\"Aves de Rapi\u00f1a<\/i>\"<br\/><br\/>Second.  That during the pendency of said criminal action (U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Martin Ocampo, Teodoro M. Kalaw, and Fidel A. Reyes) a civil action was commenced by the Hon. Dean C. Worcester against the plaintiffs in the present action, asking for damages occasioned to him by reason of the publication of said editorial <i>\"Aves de Rapi\u00f1a\"<\/i> in said newspaper called <i>El Renacimiento<\/i>.<\/blockquote><br\/>The theory of the plaintiffs is not that they are not responsible in civil damages as a result of said alleged libelous publication, but that the courts can not proceed with the civil action until the criminal action is determined and concluded.  The plaintiffs rely upon the case of Almeida Chan Tanco et al. <i>vs.<\/i> Abaroa (8 Phil. Rep., 178).  The decision in that case was based upon the provisions of the Penal Code, relating to the right of civil actions or the right to civil damages growing out  of criminal acts.  The civil and criminal actions, against a portion of the plaintiffs in the present case, are based, however, not upon the provisions of the Penal Code, but upon a law of the Philippine Commission.  This court has decided in numerous cases that the provisions of the Penal Code are not necessarily applicable to crimes created by laws of said Commission.  (U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Glefonea, 5 Phil. Rep., 570; U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Lineses, 5 Phil. Rep., 631; U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Hutchinson, 5 Phil. Rep., 343; U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Ang Kan Ko, 6 Phil. Rep., 376; U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Cortes, 7 Phil. Rep., 149; U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Macasaet, 11 Phil. Rep., 447; U. S.<i> vs.<\/i> Servillas, 12 Phil. Rep., 12.)<br\/><br\/>The said criminal action against a portion of the present plaintiffs and the said civil action against the said plaintiffs in the present action were based upon Act No. 277 of the Philippine Commission.  Said Act (No. 277) provides for a criminal action for the crime of libel, as well as a civil action for any person libeled in violation of the provisions of said Act.<br\/><br\/>Section 1 of said Act defines the crime of libel.<br\/><br\/>Section 2 provides for the punishment in such criminal action for the person who commits the acts described in said definition.<br\/><br\/>Section 11 provides that\u2014<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"In addition to the criminal action hereby prescribed, a right of civil action is also hereby given to any person libeled * * * against the person libeling him, for damages sustained by such libel  * * *.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>The theory of the plaintiffs evidently is that the result of the civil action must follow the result of the criminal action; in other words, if it should happen that the criminal action should finally be dismissed and the defendants absolved from liability, that under no condition would they be liable civilly; or, further, that the result of the criminal action is <i>res judicata<\/i> and may be pleaded in case the defendants are absolved from liability, as a bar to any civil action which might be based upon the same acts or publications.  This theory appears to be founded upon the provisions  of the Penal Code.  Said Act No. 277, however, clearly recognizes two independent and distinct actions upon the theory that there are two separate and distinct injuries received from the crime of libel; one by the State and the other by the private individual who may have been injured by such libel.<br\/><br\/>The plea of <i>res judicata<\/i> generally can not be interposed except where the parties, facts, and questions are the same.  (Balatbat <i>vs.<\/i> Tanjutco, 2 Phil. Rep., 182; O'Connell <i>vs.<\/i> Mayuga, 8 Phil. Rep., 422; Merchant <i>vs.<\/i> The International Banking Corporation, 9 Phil. Rep., 554; Palanca Tan-Guinlay <i>vs.<\/i> Quiros, 10 Phil. Rep., 360.)<br\/><br\/>In the criminal action to which reference is made in the first finding of fact above, the Government of the United States in the Philippine Islands was the plaintiff, and according to the petition filed in the present case, Martin Ocampo, Teodoro M. Kalaw, and Fidel A. Reyes were the defendants.  In the civil action, to which reference is made in paragraph 2 above, the plaintiff was the Hon. Dean C. Worcester, and the defendants were the plaintiffs in this case, or Martin Ocampo, Teodoro M. Kalaw, Fidel A. Reyes, Faustino Aguilar, Leoncio G. Liquete, Manuel Palma, Arcadio Arellano, Angel Jose, Galo Lichauco, Felipe Barretto, and Gregorio M. Cansipit.  It seems, therefore, that the parties in the two actions are not the same.  The facts may be the same in the two actions; that is to say, the two causes of action were based upon the same alleged libel or publication.  The questions, however, in the two cases presented to the court are very different.  In the criminal action the question was whether or not the acts of the defendants were in violation of section 1 of Act No. 277.  In the criminal action the question was whether or not the will of the Government had been violated as the same is expressed in said Act.  In the civil action the question presented for solution by the court was whether or not the plaintiff (Mr. Worcester) had suffered any damages by reason of said alleged libel or publication.  In the criminal action the question which the court was called upon to resolve was, Had the will of said State as expressed in Act No. 277 been violated by the said alleged libel or publication?  In the civil action the court was called upon to ascertain whether or not the Hon. Dean C. Worcester had, as an individual, suffered any of the injuries mentioned in said section 11.<br\/><br\/>The two actions, civil and criminal, provided for by Act No. 277, are given to two persons, regarding the State as a person.  The first is an offense against all of the people of the State; the second is an action granted to an individual in the State.  In effect, so far as the question of <i>res judicata<\/i> is concerned, there can be no difference between the right of these two persons (the State and the individual) to each maintain the actions given, and in a case where two individuals are libeled by the same publication.  Each, in the latter case, would be entitled to maintain a separate action and the nature and extent of the injuries received by each might be entirely different.  The evidence to support the claim of each might be based upon entirely different grounds and supported by entirely different reasons.<br\/><br\/>The question presented by the plaintiffs herein is not a new one.  It has been discussed many times by the courts and the text-book writers in relation with legislation under the Government of the United States.  The rule adopted has been substantially stated in the following form:<br\/><br\/>A judgment in a criminal prosecution constitutes no bar or estoppel  in a civil action based upon the same acts or transactions, and conversely of a judgment in a civil action sought to be given in evidence in a criminal prosecution.  The reason most often given for this holding is that <i>the two proceedings are not between the same parties<\/i>.  Different rules as to the competency of witnesses and weight of evidence necessary to the findings in the two proceedings also exist.  As between civil and criminal actions, a judgment in one is no bar or estoppel to the prosecution of the other.  A judgment in a criminal cause can not be pleaded as <i>res judicata<\/i> in a civil action.<br\/><br\/>This question has been discussed by the Supreme Court of the  United States several times.  One of the leading cases is that of Stone <i>vs.<\/i> The United States (167 U. S., 178).  Stone was prosecuted in a criminal action for a violation of the timber laws of the United States.  In the criminal action Stone was charged with illegally cutting timber from public lands in violation of the statute.  The court found that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the complaint in the criminal action.  Later the United States commenced a civil action against Stone to recover damages for the value of the timber alleged to have been illegally removed.  In discussing the case, Justice Harlan said (p. 188) :<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"In the criminal case the Government sought to punish a criminal offense, while in the civil case it only seeks in its capacity as owner of property, illegally converted, to recover its value.  In the criminal case his acquittal may have been due to the fact that the Government failed to show, beyond a reasonable doubt, the existence of some fact essential to establish the offense charged, while the same evidence in a civil action brought to recover the value of the property illegally converted might have been sufficient to entitle the Government to a verdict.  Not only was a greater degree of proof requisite to support the indictment than is sufficient to sustain the civil action, but an essential fact had to  be proved in the criminal case, which was not necessary to be proved in the present suit.  In order to convict the defendant upon the indictment for unlawfully, willfully, and feloniously cutting and removing timber from lands of the United States, it was necessary to prove <i>criminal intent on his part<\/i>, or, at least, <i>that he knew the Umber to be the property of the United States <\/i>(U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Pearce, 2 McLain, 14; Cutter <i>vs.<\/i> State, 36 N. J. Law, 125.)<\/blockquote><br\/>But the present action [says Justice Harlan] for the conversion of the timber would be supported by proof that it was in fact the <i>property of the United States, whether the defendant knew that fact or not<\/i>.  (Wooden-ware Company vs. U. S., 106 U. S., 432.)  An honest mistake of the defendant as to his title in the property <i>would be a defense to the indictment but not the civil action<\/i>.  It can not be said that any fact was conclusively established in the criminal case, except that the defendant <i>was not guilty of the public offense<\/i> with which he was charged.  We can not agree that the failure or inability of the United States to prove in the criminal case that the defendant had been guilty of a crime, either forfeited its right of property in the timber or its right in this civil action, upon a preponderance of proof, to recover the value of such property.\"  The record of the criminal proceedings was not evidence to estop or disprove any of the material facts involved in the civil action.  (Boyd vs. U. S., 116 U. S., 616, 634; Lees <i>vs.<\/i> U.  S., 150 U. S., 476, 480.)<br\/><br\/>In the case of the United States <i>vs.<\/i> Jaedicke (73 Fed. Rep., 100) a criminal action was commenced against the defendant, as postmaster, for the falsification of his books, by reason of which falsification he was able to have his salary or commissions increased.  Later the Government commenced a civil action against him for the purpose of recovering the amount of money thus illegally obtained.  The judge in deciding the case said (p.  104):<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"In the criminal case it was necessary to prove that the returns were <i>not only false, but that they were falsified by the defendant, and with the voluntary [fraudulent] intent of increasing his compensation beyond the amount allowed him by law<\/i>.  The amount sued  for in this case is simply a sum improperly withheld by the defendant in excess of his legal compensation.  Therefore, neither the facts to be established, nor the testimony to  be adduced are the same as required in the criminal case.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>See also the case of United States <i>vs.<\/i> Schneider (35 Fed. Rep., 107) where the defendant was charged in a criminal action with the violation of the revenue laws of the United States, and was later prosecuted in a civil action, and the court held that the Government was not estopped by the verdict in the criminal case to allege and prove in the civil action that the defendant was liable.<br\/><br\/>In the case of Chamberlain <i>vs.<\/i> Pierson (87 Fed. Rep., 420) both the civil and criminal actions had been prosecuted for the illegal interference with a railway track, by which the train was derailed and certain  persons injured.  In deciding the case, the court said (p. 424) :<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"Since the parties to a criminal prosecution and those in a civil suit are [necessarily] different, and as the objects and results of the two proceedings, and the rules of evidence which apply to them, respectively, are equally diverse, it follows that the judgment in the former (criminal) can not be used by way of estoppel in the latter.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>As a general rule a verdict and judgment in a criminal case can not be given in evidence in a civil action.  If the defendant was convicted in the criminal action it may have been upon the evidence of the very plaintiff in the civil action; and if he was acquitted it may have been by collusion with the prosecutor.  But, besides this, upon the same general grounds there is no mutuality; the parties can not be the same; neither are the rules of decision and course of proceeding the same; the defendant as a general rule can not avail himself in the criminal trial of any admissions of the plaintiff in the civil action; and, on the other hand, the jury in the civil action must decide upon a mere preponderance of the evidence, whereas, in order to have a criminal conviction they must be satisfied of the party's guilt, beyond a reasonable doubt; the same principle renders a judgment in a civil action inadmissible in evidence in a criminal prosecution.  It is also a principle of justice that no man ought to be bound by proceedings to which he was a stranger.  In a criminal action for libel the real person injured was not the party.  In the criminal action he had no opportunity to present evidence showing the character of his injuries.  The cause was under the direction of the representative of the State.  He had  no voice whatever in that case.<br\/><br\/>In the case of Steel <i>vs.<\/i> Cazeaux (8 Martin (La.), 318, 13 Am, Doc, 288) the supreme court of the State of Louisiana said:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"A judgment of conviction in a criminal prosecution can not be given in evidence in a civil action.  (1st Greenleaf on Evidence, sec. 537; Betts <i>vs.<\/i> New Hartford, 25 Conn., 185; Hutchinson <i>vs.<\/i> Bank of Wheeling, 41 Pa. St., 42; Beausoliel <i>vs.<\/i> Brown, 15 La. Ann., 543.)\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>In the case of McDonald <i>vs.<\/i> Stark (176 111., 456, at 468) the objection was made that the defendant had been prosecuted criminally for the same acts.  The Supreme Court said:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"To make a former action <i>res judicata<\/i> there must be identity in the thing sued for, identity of the cause of action, and identity of persons and parties to the  action.  The criminal action wag in the name of the People of the State of Illinois and not in the name of Stark, as an individual.  There was no identity to the action and it can not be a bar to this action.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>In actions for slander or libel where the defendant is charged with having accused the plaintiff with the commission of a crime or other acts which reflected upon his character, it is held by the great weight of modern authority that the defendant may sustain his defense and the plaintiff may sustain his cause of action by a preponderance of evidence.  (Reilley <i>vs.<\/i> Norton, 65 Iowa, 306; Sloane <i>vs.<\/i> Gilbert, 23  Am. Dec, 708; Greenleaf on Evidence, 426; Townsend on Slander and Libel, 2d ed., 644; Hilliard on Torts,-Cooley on Torts, 208.)<br\/><br\/>In the case of Ellis Buzzell (60 Maine, 209) the plaintiff claimed that the defendant had slandered him by charging him with the fact that he had been guilty of the crime of adultery.  The plaintiff brought an action to recover damages.  The court held that in an action for damages a preponderance of the evidence was sufficient to sustain the charge.  In the last case, in discussing the right to bring a civil and criminal action and the rules of evidence applicable to each, the court said:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"But we think it time to limit the application of a rule which was originally adopted <i>in favorem vitae<\/i> in the days of a sanguinary penal code to cases arising on a criminal docket, and no longer to suffer it to obstruct or encumber the action in civil suits, sounding only in damages.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>This court has already recognized the right of the private person injured by a libel to maintain an action for damages independent of any criminal action which the State might deem advisable to maintain.  (Macleod <i>vs.<\/i> The Philippine Publishing Co., 12 Phil. Rep., 427.)  In that case, however, the question presented here was not presented nor discussed, and can not, therefore, serve as a precedent to the present case.  One thing is certain, however, that it did not occur to the lawyers in that case that the criminal action must necessarily precede or in any way affect the civil action for damages.  In the criminal action provided for under said Act (No. 277) certain defenses, such as the truth of the publication and the purposes of the publication, were given to the defendant.  Under section 11 of said Act, it is expressly provided that \"the presumptions, rules of evidence, and special defenses herein provided for criminal prosecutions shall be equally applicable in civil actions under this section.\"<br\/><br\/>This provision clearly indicates that the civil action for damages resulting from the libel is a separate and distinct action from the criminal action provided for.<br\/><br\/>For all of the foregoing reasons we are of the opinion and so hold that the facts set out in the petition of the plaintiffs herein are not sufficient to entitle them to the preliminary injunction prayed for.  That part of the prayer of the plaintiffs is, therefore, hereby denied.<br\/><br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Carson, Moreland<\/i>, and <i>Elliott, JJ<\/i>., concur.<\/div>",

and in case the fulfillment of the contract should be in accordance with the law, they claim that it is not sufficient to return the money advanced, but that the plaintiffs must also refund the expenses incurred in repairing the fish pond, as agreed to in the contract.<br\/><br\/>The case came up for trial and evidence being adduced by both\u00a0 parties to the suit, the Court of First Instance of Bulacan found \"that the plaintiffs are entitled to redeem the fish pond, ordering the defendants to give the plaintiffs possession thereof upon refund to the latter by the former of the sum of 163 pesos.\" It overrules the motion to sentence the plaintiffs to pay any determined amount on account of repairs made on the property, and sentences the defendants to pay the costs.<br\/><br\/>From the above judgment the defendants have appealed to this court requesting a review of the evidence; the appeal having been heard, together with the briefs of the parties herein, it results:<br\/><br\/>That against the judgment of the court below the appellants have assigned the following errors:<br\/><br\/><ol><li>The overruling of all the foundations of the answer.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>The recognition of the hereditary right, derived from the title of the spouses Hernandez\u00a0 and Castro, under which the plaintiffs have brought the action.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>The recognition of Francisco Hernandez as the only surviving son.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>The holding that a prior judicial declaration of the principal's heirs was not necessary in order to bring the action\u00a0 derived from him.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>The holding that the legal capacity of the children of Hernandez and Castro had been\u00a0 expressly recognized by the parents of the defendants.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>The holding that it is immaterial so far as the efficacy of the action brought by the plaintiffs is concerned, whether or not the\u00a0 property belonged to Sabino Hernandez or to Basilia Castro.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>The holding that it is impossible to establish with certainty the amount of the expenses incurred in repairs to the property.<\/li><\/ol><br\/>And, finally, all the findings contained in the judgment.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the legal capacity of the plaintiffs referred to in the first six assignments of error, it has been fully proven:\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 That defendants' document Exhibit 2 shows Santos, Francisco, and Rosauro, the children of Sabino Hernandez, named as stated above, to have been recognized by the spouses Rafael Padua and Dominica de los Santos as successors to the right of their late father in the pledge of the fish pond, and by virtue thereof they received the additional 63 pesos; (2) that it was fully established at the trial of the case that Francisco is the son of Sabino Hernandez; (3) that it is an erroneous averment in the fourth assignment of error in \"that at the present time letters of administration produce the same effects as the old declaration of heirship,\" which is as much as to say that there must be a previous legal declaration of heirs in the order issuing the letters of administration, in order that the right of action, derived from the right of a deceased principal, may be exercised by the heir; the real doctrine, on the contrary, is that set up by the court <i>a quo<\/i>, to wit:\u00a0 \"It is not necessary that the children of Basilia Castro and her husband Sabino Hernandez be declared their legal heirs in order to efficiently exercise said right.\"\u00a0 The basis for this doctrine is clearly shown by section 596 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br\/><br\/>Neither is there any legal precept, nor established rule of law which requires a legitimate child to furnish any document or written evidence establishing its status as the heir of its intestate parents, or either one of them.<br\/><br\/>It is of little or no importance in this controversy that the real\u00a0 owner of the fish pond was Sabino Hernandez, and not Basilia Castro, or that Sabino Hernandez pledged it as his own property, or that the plaintiffs derived their right from their father or from their mother.\u00a0 The learned trial judge has rightly said that it is immaterial, \"so far as the efficacy of the action brought by the plaintiffs is concerned, whether or not the property belonged to Sabino Hernandez or Basilia Castro,\" from the moment that it has been proven that the plaintiffs are the actual representatives of the pledgor, and the legitimate heirs of either one of their parents.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, in so far as the contract of pledge is concerned, the judgment is in accordance with the law.\u00a0 The defendants in their written exception thereto state that \"it made no difference to them whether they (the plaintiffs) or anybody else acquired the property, so long as they were paid for the value of the same, that is, the sums advanced to the pledgor, and such subsequent sums as they had paid for its upkeep.\"\u00a0 (B. of E., 16.)<br\/><br\/>With regard to the seventh and eight assignments of error relative to the dismissal of the claim for payment of the expenses said to have been made on the property, the court below was unable to ascertain anything from the confused and uncertain data offered in the case.<br\/><br\/>Upon this assertion being impugned we find:\u00a0 (1) That the defendants in their amended answer \"allege a counter-claim consisting of their right to recover from the pledgors of the said fish pond the sum of 163 pesos, for which it was given as security, plus the expenses entailed in repairing the same for the period of time during which it was held as security under the stipulations of the document, dated, January, 1880, pledging the said fish pond to wit; the sum of 405 pesos, being at the rate of 15 pesos per annum during the twenty-seven years of possession of the said fish pond claimed by the defendants, which added to the said 163 pesos make a total of P568, Philippine currency, which the plaintiffs have to pay to the defendants in the event that the lower court should acknowledge the right of the plaintiffs to redeem the fish pond in question.\u00a0 (B. of E., 7 and 8.)<br\/><br\/>In the\u00a0 complaint the expenses for repairs are claimed by way of interest at something less than 10 per cent per annum, but an attempt was afterwards made to prove at the trial that damages were repaired in 1882 and 1889, but the only witness speaking of this says that they amounted to 431 pesos and 50 centavos, something which does not appear from the document which he himself signed; and the only thing that another witness states is that in\u00a0 1882 what Rafael Padua did was, \"to destroy one of the embankments and with it fill in another embankment,\" and that \"in 1889 the embankment that had been filled in was also destroyed.\"\u00a0 With these data it is not possible to hold that the lower court erred in dismissing the counterclaim for the cost of repairs.<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing the judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed with the costs of this instance.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Johnson, Carson<\/i>, and <i>Moreland, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><\/div>",

he won his bet and cashed it, whereupon Clemente Magcomot who was dealing, with Pedro Megnave as paying teller, stood up and shouted:\u00a0 'We be d- (<i>mal rayo nos parta<\/i>); it looks as though we are among swindlers; then he left the table and the gamblers, of whom I was one, got up, and went down stairs.\u00a0 While on the ground floor of the house a quarrel began between Pedro and Clemente on the one side, and the deceased Bonifacio on the other, and in the meanwhile Epifanio approached them and also participated in the dispute and stabbed the deceased Bonifacio with a <i>flamenco.\"<\/i><br\/><\/blockquote>It clearly appears from the record that Epifanio Magcomot is the only one who inflicted a wound on the deceased, and that said Epifanio at the beginning\u00a0 of the quarrel between the deceased and Clemente and his companions, was visiting the house of one Esteban Vasquez, situated at a distance of about five <i>brazas<\/i>-according to the judgment of the lower court-from the place of the occurrence, Epifanio arriving at the very moment when Isidro and Clemente Magcomot had overpowered the deceased.\u00a0 It was recounted by the trial judge in the following words:\u00a0 \"The said Isidro and Clemente Magcomot had Bonifacio Cabaleo overpowered until Epifanio Magcomot <i>suddenly<\/i> appeared on the scene * * *.\u00a0 It is fully proven, beyond reasonable doubt,\" the judgment continues, \"that Epifanio\u00a0 Magcomot inflicted the wound which caused the death of Bonifacio Gabaleo, while his sons, Isidro and Clemente, had the deceased overpowered.\"<br\/><br\/>If the appearance of Epifanio on the scene of the crime was without any warning, his assault on the deceased was in like manner sudden and without warning.\u00a0 The testimony of the two aforementioned witnesses for the prosecution touching this point is very explicit.\u00a0 Braulio Pasco testified that Epifanio, on arriving at the scene of the crime, <i>stabbed Bonifacio at once<\/i>.\u00a0 Hilario Gozon testified that \"I saw Epifanio carrying a <i>flamenco<\/i>, and on arriving at the place of the crime he <i>stabbed<\/i> Bonifacio <i>at once;\"<\/i> the witness also testified that the accused acted without saying a word.\u00a0 This shows in the most unquestionable manner that the aggression on the deceased was not the outcome of a plan arranged previously or at the time, by Epifanio Magcomot and his coaccused.\u00a0 Said aggression was carried out by the former on his own account and without any connection with the acts of the latter.\u00a0 Their quarrel with the deceased arose out of a question about the sum of five centavos; neither the trivial cause of said quarrel nor the actions of Isidro and Clemente Magcomot during the dispute lead us to believe that it was their intention to take Bonifacio's life, because, in reality, they did the deceased no harm of consequence, in spite of the fact that they had the chance so to do, had they wished, before the arrival of Epifanio.<br\/><br\/>The arrival of the latter was entirely accidental and unexpected, and the assault he made on the deceased was so unexpected, so <i>sudden<\/i>, as stated by the witnesses for the prosecution, that in all probability his codefendants would not have been able to check it even though they had wished so to do, it being, furthermore, very likely that they had no knowledge of,the assault\u00a0 until after it was consummated, the same having been so rapid and having been committed in the darkness of night, and while they were then engaged in overpowering the deceased.\u00a0 In view of all the circumstances of the case we are satisfied that the assault was committed without the concurrence of the will of Isidro and Clemente Magcomot, and in the absence of that volition, which is the fundamental source of criminal liability, these codefendants can not lawfully be held liable for\u00a0 the aggression and its consequences.\u00a0 On the other hand, it can not be pleaded that the acts committed on the body of the deceased by said codefendants and by Epifanio were perpetrated at the same time, because this simultaneousness does not of itself demonstrate the concurrence of wills nor the unity of action and purpose which are the bases of the responsibility of two or more individuals, and in the\u00a0 absence of which it is strictly just, in accordance with the sound principles of law, that each one should only be held liable for the acts perpetrated by him.<br\/><br\/>A case similar to the one before us is that expounded in No. 7, page 130, volume 7, of Viada's commentaries on the Penal Code, in the following terms:<br\/><blockquote>\"If, on account of a quarrel, two persons assault another, one of them striking the latter on the face with a stick and inflicting injuries which would have healed in thirty days, while the other aggressor caused him a deep wound in the breast with a cutting weapon, from which instant death resulted, should both accused be held liable as authors of the homicide so committed, if, according to the verdict of the jury, it has not been shown that <i>there existed between the two a previous agreement to kill?<\/i> It was so held-says Viada-by the audiencia of Malaga, whose decision was reversed for the following reasons by the supreme court as violating articles 13 and 433 of the code so far as concerned the accused who inflicted only the less grave injuries: 'Inasmuch as the judgment appealed from clearly and distinctly established the participation of the defendants Joaquin and Antonio Ramirez in the less grave injuries inflicted upon, and the sudden killing of Jose del Rio, by holding the appellant liable for said injuries, and by making said Antonio specifically responsible for the death of the victim; and inasmuch as in the commission of both crimes it <i>does not appear that there existed previous agreement, connivance or persuasion for its execution,<\/i> the criminal liability <i>should be limited to the acts independently committed by each defendant;<\/i> on this supposition, and whereas it does not appear that Joaquin Ramirez had, previously or at the time, any knowledge of the crime of homicide perpetrated by his brother, he must be held to answer only for the crime by him committed, to wit, that of less grave injuries as defined and punished by article 433 of the Penal Code.\u00a0\u00a0 For the above-stated reasons the <i>audiencia provincial<\/i> of Malaga committed the error and violation of the law alleged in the appeal, etc.\u00a0 (Decision of January 27, 1896.)\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The same legal principle is embodied in the\u00a0 decisions of the supreme court of Spain, rendered on April 9, 1878; October 14,1887; October 8, 1889; February 19, and March 6, 1896; and July 6, 1897.\u00a0 In all of said decisions it is uniformly laid down that, in the absence of a previous\u00a0 plan or agreement between the culprits, the criminal liability resulting from different acts committed against one and the same person is individual and not collective, each one of the culprits being responsible only for those acts committed by himself.<br\/><br\/>For these considerations, and on the supposition that there existed no agreement between Isidro and Clemente Magcomot and Epifanio Magcomot to commit the aggression which caused the death of Bonifacio Gabaleo, which death was caused solely by the latter, while the former, acting independently and without agreement with Epifanio, were overpowering Bonifacio Gabaleo, we hold that said Isidro and Clemente are not responsible for the death of Bonifacio Gabaleo and are therefore entitled to an acquittal.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is reversed and Isidro and Clemente Magcomot are acquitted, and, with the costs of both instances <i>de oficio<\/i>, it is hereby ordered that they be set at liberty at once.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

That originally the <i>estancia<\/i> or small farm of Angono was granted to General Don Domingo Antonio de Otero Bermudez, who was a Spaniard, to the prejudice of the inhabitants of Angono, who were <i>Indios<\/i>, in violation of laws 7 and 8, title 12, book 3 [4], of the <i>Recopilacion de las Leyes de Indias<\/i>; and that when the title was issued, with royal approval, in favor of the <i>Al feres Real<\/i> Don Andres Blanco Berinudez, as successor to Don Domingo Antonio de Otero Berinudez, it was done without prejudice to third persons who might show a better right, which indicates that the ownership and possession of Don Andres Blanco Bermudez were\u00a0 not absolute.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the half of the hacienda derived from Francisco Guido, the appellants allege that the said half is not entered in the registry of property, and that, according to article 23 of the Mortgage\u00a0 Law, the titles cannot prejudice third persons.\u00a0 The said article provides that:<br\/><blockquote>\"The instruments mentioned in articles 2 and 5 which are not duly recorded or entered in the registry can not prejudice third persons.<br\/><br\/>\"The record of real property and property rights, acquired throiv4'h an inheritance or legacy, shall not prejudice third persons until five years have elapsed since the date thereof,\u00a0 excepting in cases of testate or intestate inheritances, legacies and\u00a0 additions thereto (<i>mejoras<\/i>), when left to legal heirs.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>Therefore, the defendants being third parties with respect to the plaintiffs, the titles of property presented by the latter can not prejudice the former.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the other half derived from the succession of Dominga Santa Ana, it is alleged that, although the possession is recorded in the registry of\u00a0 property, as such registration dates only from the 15th of July, 1899, it can not convert the title of possession into a title of ownership except at the expiration of twenty years, according to the provisions of article 393 of the Mortgage Law, and consequently the present title is not one of<br\/>ownership.<br\/><br\/>The original title to the whole hacienda of Angono is by <i>composicion<\/i> and royal approval issued on the 16th of December, 1749, and 15th of September, 1752; the former being an order of the following tenor:<br\/><blockquote>\"ORDER.-In the farmhouse of the hacienda of Angono, which is in the Province of La Laguna de Bay, on the 16th day of the month of December in the year 1749, the <i>Se\u00f1or Licenciado<\/i> Don Pedro Calderon Enriquez, of His Majesty's council, <i>oidor<\/i> (associate justice) of the <i>Real Audiencia<\/i> of these Islands and special judge of tire Commission for the sale and composition\u00a0 of lands in the whole district thereof.\u00a0 Having seen the instruments of title that General Don Domingo Antonio de Otero Bermudez has produced for the purpose of substantiating the legitimate ownership and possession that he has of the so-called hacienda of Angono, together with the other lands and <i>estancia<\/i> of Binangonan and the lime quarries of San Guillermo, all of them consolidated under the name of hacienda and <i>estancia<\/i> of Angono, with the acknowledgment and declaration which, in view of the said original documents, was made by Se\u00f1or Don Juan de Ozaeta y Oro, who was a member of His Majesty's council, <i>oidor<\/i> of the <i>Real Audiencia<\/i> of these Islands, and special judge of the said land commission for the year 1699, approving the<br\/>said titles and holding the same to be good;

and bearing also in mind the proceedings upon the visit, demarkation and survey just made of the limits of said hacienda, together with the claims of the natives of some of the adjoining towns, and all other evidence leading to the greater and better knowledge of the true boundaries of the said hacienda, the said <i>oidor<\/i> said:\u00a0 That it was his duty to declare, and he does hereby declare, that the titles presented by the said General Don Domingo Bermudez are good and legitimate, and in consequence thereof the true limits of the said hacienda run through the places and localities stated in the proceedings in connection with the demarkation and survey just made.\"<br\/><br\/>\"ORDER.-At the city of Manila on the 15th day of the month of September, 1752, Se\u00f1or Don Pedro Calderon Enriquez, of His Majesty's council, <i>oidor<\/i> and <i>alcalde del crimen<\/i> of the <i>Real Audiencia<\/i> of these Islands and special judge of the Commission for the sale and composition of land in the whole of its territory, having seen the record of proceedings in\u00a0 which are described the demarkation and survey of the <i>estancia<\/i> of Angono, with the prayer of the <i>Alferez Real<\/i> Don Andres Blanco Bermudez, who succeeds to said lands by reason of the death\u00a0 of said General Don Domingo de Otero Bermudez, his uncle, to the effect that his title to the said <i>estancia<\/i> and lime quarries be affirmed by means of a resolution, and after examining everything that was proper to see and examine the said gentleman stated that it was his duty to order, and that lie does hereby order that title of confirmation in due form be issued to the said<i> Alferez Real<\/i> of this most noble city, Don Andres Blanco Bermudez of the aforesaid titles, and in view of the said instruments and declaratory order above inserted he directed that the present title of confirmation of the said titles be issued in proper form in order that they may be held and considered as such true and legitimate titles, and the <i>Alferez Real<\/i> Don Andres Blanco Bermudez as the lawful possessor and owner of the said hacienda, and he hereby orders every one not to presume to molest, disturb, or dispute the legitimacy of the aforesaid titles:\u00a0 <i>Provided, however<\/i>, That they shall not prejudice third persons having a better right, and that the said declaratory orders and this confirmation shall be observed by all judges and their substitutes until His Majesty may order otherwise.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The first order was at the same time a resolution entered in the proceedings had before the Superior Government of these Islands by the people of Binangonan, and, in connection with the proceedings the said order contains this declaration :<br\/><blockquote>\"That the said\u00a0 natives do not possess, nor have they produced any lawful title to prove the ownership or possession of the lands belonging to said hacienda which they took and occupied by force of arms in the year 1745, at a time when several towns mutinied and revolted, and that none of the said natives, although they were summoned and saw the tape passed through the limits and neighborhood of their town, came forward to claim, contradict, or protest in any way or point out a different stream or river named Mabalan, and the said gentleman ordered that the inhabitants of the said town be notified to abstain in future from working the lands that they occupied and which are separated by said stream, as otherwise they would be punished for interference and for again occupying them without the will and consent of the owner thereof; for the same act the <i>gobernadorcillo<\/i>, officials and <i>cabezas de barangay<\/i> are sentenced to be deprived of their offices and to be confined with hard labor, in the Cavite Prison on ration and without salary, and otherwise as may be proper.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>From the foregoing it appears that the absolute ownership granted by the State to the first persons to acquire the property, Otero and Blanco, is fully proven; their titles of ownership are made final by virtue of the provision of the <i>real cedula<\/i> of October 15, 1754, article 5 of which reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Neither shall possessors of lands sold or adjusted by the various subdelegates from the year 1700 to the present time be molested, disturbed, or denounced, now or at any other time, with respect to such possession, if such sales or adjustments shall have been confirmed by me, or by the viceroy or the president of the court of the district in which the lands are located, while authorized to exercise this power.\u00a0 In cases where the sales or adjustments shall not have been so confirmed, the possessors will present to the courts of their respective districts and to the other officials hereby empowered to receive the same, a petition asking for the confirmation of said sales and adjustments.\u00a0 After the proceedings outlined by the subdelegates in their order with respect to the measurement and valuation of the said lands, and with reference to the title issued therefor, shall have been duly completed, said courts and officials will make an examination of the same for the purpose of ascertaining whether the sale or adjustment has been made without fraud or collusion, and for an adequate and equitable price, and a similar examination shall be made by the prosecuting attorney of the district, to the end that, in view of all the proceedings, etc., there will be issued to the possessor, in my royal name, a confirmation of his title, by authority of which his possession and ownership of\u00a0 lands and waters represented will be fully legalized, to the end that at no time will he or his heirs or assigns be disturbed or molested therein.\"\u00a0 (Cited in the case of Andres Valenton <i>vs<\/i>. Manuel Murciano, 3 Phil. Rep., 537, 540.)<br\/><\/blockquote>The said titles are therefore absolute and unconditional notwithstanding the clause, of mere matter of form, of \"without prejudice to third persons who may prove a better right.\"\u00a0 The natives or residents of the town of Angono could never be such persons with a better right either as against Otero, or Blanco, nor against their successors Miguel Cacho, Pascual Santa Ana, and Francisco Guido, because, in the first place, they constituted a town within the same <i>Estancia<\/i> or <i>Hacienda<\/i> of Angono, and they could hardly constitute a different entity which for<br\/>the time being-that is, at the commencement of the hacienda-might invoke a right of its own, when those tenants of the hacienda had but a precarious right in opposition to the owners thereof; and, in the second place, because similarly to those of Binangonan who expressed their opposition, it may be said and shown, as stated and established in the judgment appealed from, that up to this day they have not been able to produce their title of ownership or of possession.<br\/><br\/>It must be added to this that if they ever had any right, they can\u00a0 not exercise it except in the form and manner prescribed in article 8 of the royal decree of the 26th of January, 1889, and article 5 of the royal decree of the 26th of October, 1881; they could only direct their claims against the administration, and in no wise against the grantees of the land.\u00a0 (Valenton <i>vs<\/i>. Murciano, 3 Phil. Rep., 537, 554, 555.)<br\/><br\/>With respect to the half of the hacienda that according to the last transfers, was derived from Francisco Guido, the appellants have only alleged, as has been seen, that at the present time said titles of ownership lack force as against third persons, such as they hold themselves to be, for the reason that they are not registered in the registry of property.<br\/><br\/>It is a frequent error to mistake the third person of the civil law for the third person of the Mortgage Law; this error arises from the lack of knowledge, evidenced in many cases which have been heard by this Supreme Court, of the character of the latter law which operates in favor of third persons against third persons, in relation to the solemnity and efficiency of the registration of a real right, in no wise in favor of a person who turns out to be and calls himself a third party because there are two other prior parties between whom some act or contract of acquisition or conveyance of ownership or of some other real right exists; the appellants themselves have cited a paragraph of the commentaries to the Mortgage Law by Galindo and Escosura, of which the first lines reveal the intent and purposes of said law:\u00a0 \"The object of the present mortgage system was to protect the rights of the person who registers his property against him who has not registered * * *.\"\u00a0 (2, p. 419), and Manresa, the commentator of<br\/>the Civil Code, in speaking of the Mortgage Law, says:<br\/><blockquote>\"The law always tends to protect registered rights, to favor him who registers, and therefore, that the registration made shall prejudice those who have not registered.\u00a0 As a general rule it may be affirmed that where the law speaks of <i>prejudice<\/i> to a third person, said third person is the one defined by article 27, as <i>he who has not registered<\/i>, nor participated in the act or contract <i>that was registered<\/i>; and whenever\u00a0 it says that <i>a third person can not he prejudiced<\/i> such third person is he who bases his right on a <i>registered title<\/i>,\"\u00a0 (4 Civil Code, 302.)<br\/><br\/>\"The different persons who may generally be considered as third parties with respect to each act or contract, are divided by the Mortgage Law into two groups; third parties for the effects of the civil law, and third parties for the effects of the Mortgage Law.\u00a0 While no registered title exists the civil law governs; real rights arise or not independently of the registration, and the third parties may or may not be prejudiced without the intervention of the Mortgage Law.\u00a0 From the time that a written act or contract exists, there are third parties for the effects of said law, and registration determines preference and acquisition of rights to their prejudice.\"\u00a0 (Ibid., 302.)<br\/><\/blockquote>The provisions of the Mortgage Law are absolutely inapplicable to the present contention because the matter at issue does not fall within the purpose of said law; not one of the rights that are contested is registered; they are rights which can only be discussed and decided under the precepts of the civil law or of the Civil Code now in force; and in the face of the Civil Code in force, against the\u00a0 titles of ownership put forward by the appellees, for the purpose of effecting the recovery of possession<br\/>of the hacienda of Angono, the residents of said town, the appellants herein, set up no title whatever, either of ownership or of possession; they only oppose the mere fact of the material possession of certain parcels of land of the said hacienda, which they held on lease or lease on shares until the year 1903 when, as one of the appellees states, they rose against the ownership of the hacienda.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">FOURTH AND FIFTH ERRORS.<br\/><\/div><br\/>The court below has not erred in considering as proven that all the appellants are tenants or lessees on shares of the hacienda of Angono.<br\/><br\/>Neither has it erred in considering as proven that they owe the appellees for ground rent, tenancy, or lease on shares, the amounts in money or in products itemized in the statements Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 filed with the complaint.<br\/><br\/>These allegations of error are based on the lack of identity of the defendants herein as such tenants or lessees on shares of the hacienda of Angono.\u00a0 It is admitted in the brief that out of 155 defendants 51 are shown to be tenants according to documentary evidence offered and admitted at the trial; it appears therein that they subscribed to proceedings served in February, 1898, on them personally as such tenants of the said hacienda, to compel<br\/>them to deposit what they respectively had to pay for ground rent,\u00a0 tenancy, or lease on shares; but that it has not been proven that the others are such tenants, except by the testimony of one witness and the four statements which accompany the complaint.<br\/><br\/>For the purpose of deciding this question, the reason alleged by the appellees in their answer is conclusive.<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"The identity said in the brief of the adverse party to be lacking with respect to some of the defendant appellants is altogether unnecessary and immaterial from the moment that the defendants, all of them, have appeared before the lower court and answered\u00a0 the complaint by their own names, as they are named in the complaint.\u00a0 No question has been raised in the court below with respect to any of the names of the defendant appellants; on the contrary, as has been said they all appeared, and all of them<br\/>answered the complaint by the same names that appear therein, which fact shows their admission of and conformity to this part of\u00a0 the complaint.\"\u00a0 (Brief, 17.)<br\/><\/blockquote><div style=\"text-align: center;\">FIRST\u00a0 ERROR.<br\/><\/div><br\/>The court below did not err in considering that all the defendants\u00a0 are properly joined in the complaint of the plaintiff appellees.<br\/><br\/>The appellants allege that they are not united in one sole contract so that by reason thereof, they may be sued jointly, and that the parcels of land which they respectively hold constitute matter for separate and distinct causes of action.<br\/><br\/>The accumulation of parties in this case is\u00a0 a result of the unity of action, unity of object, and unity of defense.\u00a0 Unity of action inasmuch as, in view of the attitude of the defendants, who seek to obtain the ownership of the hacienda, the complaint has for its object the recovery of possession of the lawful owners who, until 1903, allowed the defendants to remain in possession of certain parcels thereof under contract of lease or lease on shares; unity of object, which can not be less than the entire hacienda, because it is detained in its entirety by the defendants, united together with manifest intent for the purpose; and unity of defense, because the pretension of the defendants is one, to wit, that of being themselves the owners of the hacienda.\u00a0 Joinder could not have been more imperative even if, after considerable expense and delay, a separate action had been brought against each one of the tenants Who now detain the hacienda.\u00a0 Section 114 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which the court below took into consideration, is applicable herein:<br\/><blockquote>\"Any person should be made a defendant who has or claims an interest in the controversy or the subject-matter thereof adverse to the plaintiff, or who is a necessary party to a complete determination or settlement of the questions involved therein.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Exhibit P, offered in evidence by the plaintiffs and admitted by the lower court over the exception of the defendants, which exception however, has not been brought before this court, is a notarial act drawn up at the instance of one of the plaintiffs, Justo Guido, for the purpose of obtaining a copy of the resolution agreed upon by the tenants, and which Guido testified was delivered to him by Dominador Gomez, to whom\u00a0 the original was returned.\u00a0 It reads thus:<br\/><br\/>\"* * * all the residents of this town (Angono) attended a meeting, and, being assembled, Councilor Januario Villamayor, as president, took the floor and informed those present at the meeting that in consequence of the oppressed condition of this town, the inhabited portion of which is surrounded by an hacienda possessed by the heirs of Do\u00f1a Dominga Santa Ana, an investigation and search for documentary proofs to permit those who claim to be the owners to exercise acts of ownership was contemplated * * *; hence, in order to avoid, as much as possible, disturbing the peace of the inhabitants as always happens in litigious questions of this kind, it is the opinion of the majority of the\" residents that an agreement should be entered into between the latter and the owners of the former, with the intervention of the Honorable W. Kincaid and Doctor Gomez, who promise to settle this matter peacefully upon an offer to pay them with one-half of the level lands of the hacienda within a reasonable period of time.\u00a0 Thereupon all parties present, after an extensive discussion\u00a0 of the matter, assented to said agreement being carried out and that adequate and clear contracts should be drawn up and subjected to sound and indulgent criticism * * *.\"<br\/><br\/>It is evident that they unanimously promised to dispose of one-half of the hacienda in payment for their defense as though they were coowners, knowing that they disposed of one-half of the hacienda which, as they say, \"surrounds the inhabited portion of the town,\" \"the hacienda that is possessed by the heirs of Do\u00f1a Dominga Santa Ana,\" whom \"within a reasonable period of time\" they purposed to spoliate of the whole of it, and immediately thereafter to dispose of one-half of its level lands in order to pay their lawyer and the above-named Doctor Gomez.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">SECOND ERROR.<br\/><\/div><br\/>Neither has the court below erred in holding that it had jurisdiction to hear the claim brought by the plaintiff appellees-that is to say, the second cause of action with reference to the prayer that the defendants, now the appellants, be sentenced to pay the plaintiffs the amounts owing for ground rent, tenancy, or lease on shares, as itemized in the statements filed with the complaint as a part thereof.<br\/><br\/>The argument on appeal consists of the citation of paragraph 3, section 56 of Act No. 136, and of the fact that, \"from the same judgment appealed from, it has been fully demonstrated that, with\u00a0 the exception of Felix Miranda, none of the other defendants owe any one or all of the plaintiffs any amount in money or in products equal to the sum of 100 dollars or more, excluding interest,\" which is the amount fixed by said section with reference to the jurisdiction of a Court of First Instance.<br\/><br\/>In proof of its jurisdiction the court below cites section 90 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and the appellees cite in corroboration section 427 of the Code of California, according to which plaintiff may join several causes of action in the complaint when they are based on \"claims to recover a specific piece of realty, with or without damages for its retention or injury, and the rents and products of the same.\"<br\/><br\/>The natural effect of an action for recovery is the restoration of the thing together with its fruits, accessories, and payment of damages.\u00a0 In the second finding of the judgment appealed from, the plaintiffs were not granted the fruits or crops and plantings of the defendants on the hacienda of Angono, but in exchange, each\u00a0 of them was sentenced to pay the amounts in cash and in <i>palay<\/i> (paddy) which they appeared to be owing, as specified in the statements attached to the complaint as a part thereof.<br\/><br\/>The fruits that the defendants are obliged to restore, together\u00a0 with the thing not belonging to but retained by them, are not only the natural fruits, which have justly been denied by the judgment appealed from, but also the civil fruits which consist of the rent for the buildings and the price of the lease of the lands.\u00a0 (Civil Code, 355.)<br\/><br\/>Beginning with the fact that the crops or products of the detained land are fruits obtained by those who, as tenants, worked the lands, it was not proper to deprive them of the same; but from the moment that they desired to usurp the ownership of the hacienda, and commenced to act in the bad faith with which they at present retain possession, instead of owing those fruits they owe the civil, not, however, by virtue of a contract which they now disown, but by virtue of the right of accession which accompanies the right of recovery.\u00a0 And if they were sued as one sole party for the restitution of the hacienda, they must be sued as such for the restitution of its civil fruits, in their character of accessories, not as a matter of compliance with a lease contract; for all of which reasons the finding in the judgment is fully in\u00a0 accordance with the law.<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing, the judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed with the costs of this instance against the appellants.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa, Johnson; Carson<\/i>, and <i>Willard, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><\/div>",

She intervened and filed a complaint alleging that she was the owner of two parcels of land that had been attached as being the property of Catalino Monta\u00f1ano, by virtue of an order of execution issued in an action brought against him by the defendant herein, Silvestre Suesa.  The  appellant was defeated in the first instance, and excepted to the judgment, moving later on for a new trial on the ground that the said judgment was contrary to the weight of the evidence adduced in the case.  Her motion for a new trial was presented on January 20,1908, and on the 31st of the same month the bill of exceptions which has been submitted to this court was filed.  No ruling whatever appears to have been made on said motion, consequently no provision was made to except thereto in the event it were overruled.  The motion not being overruled and duly excepted to, this court can not review the evidence in the case; it can only base its decision on the facts found to have been proven in the judgment appealed from, and admitted by the parties in their respective briefs.  (Sec. 497, Code of Civil Procedure, as amended by Act No. 1596; Hijos de I. de la Rama <i>vs.<\/i> Robles and Robles, 8 Phil. Rep., 712.)<br\/><br\/>According to the judgment the following facts have been proven:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"That the property described in the complaint was owned by the late Catalino Monta\u00f1ano, father of the plaintiff Gregoria Monta\u00f1ano; that prior to his death the said Catalino Monta\u00f1ano executed his last will and testament, by which he declares his children Gregoria, Catalino, and  Manuel Monta\u00f1ano, to be heirs to the property left by  him in the shares or portions respectively designated in the said will; that the said will was duly authenticated on the 2d of February, 1906, and the defendant herein, Silvestre Suesa, being appointed administrator of the estate, presented an inventory of the property left by Catalino Monta\u00f1ano, sr., deceased; that in numbers 8 and 38 of the said inventory the two parcels of land in controversy are described; that the plaintiff has endeavored to prove that'the parcels of land claimed in her complaint were ceded to her as a gift by her father, Catalino Monta\u00f1ano, during his lifetime, and that she had ever since been in possession thereof, but while these facts have not been fully demonstrated, on the other hand it appears by the evidence and the will executed by Catalino Monta\u00f1ano, sr., that the person whom he designated to inherit the parcels of land above-referred to was his son Catalino, parcels of land situated in other barrios being left to the plaintiff Gregoria Montanano.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>Lastly, it was held in the judgment that the evidence adduced by the plaintiff, both documentary and oral, does not establish her pretended ownership to the property in question.<br\/><br\/>According to the foregoing considerations of the lower court not only has the plaintiff failed to prove that she is the owner of the lands in controversy, but there is positive evidence that they belong to her brother Catalino, against whom they were attached.  In the opinion of the court below this evidence consists of the duly authenticated will of the late Catalino Monta\u00f1ano, their ancestor, in which it is set forth that said lands were willed by the testator to his son Catalino, entirely different parcels being assigned to the plaintiff herein.  With reference to this point the judge below expresses himself in the following terms:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"As the will executed by Catalino Monta\u00f1ano, sr., was duly authenticated, and the portion of the property left by the testator corresponding to each one of his heirs being stated therein, one must necessarily conclude that the latter are entitled to make their own those properties indicated in the said will in the manner provided by the testator himself.  If, therefore, Catalino Monta\u00f1ano  was instituted heir under said will of the two parcels of land described in paragraph 1 of the complaint, it is unquestionable that no one but him can be recognized as the owner thereof, by title of inheritance from his father Catalino Monta\u00f1ano.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>The appellant maintains that the trial judge erred in attributing such probatory force to the testamentary provisions of the late Catalino Montanano from the mere fact that his will had been authenticated, because as she states, although it is true that it is  conclusive with respect to the proper execution of the same, and as to the capacity of the testator, yet, according to the doctrine set up in the matters of Casta\u00f1eda <i>vs.<\/i> Alemany (3 Phil. Rep., 426) and Pimental <i>vs.<\/i> Palanca (5 Phil. Rep., 436), it is not so with regard to the validity of the provisions therein contained.<br\/><br\/>The true import and meaning of this doctrine is by its own terms so clear and precise that any further explanation seems unnecessary.  The authentication of a will decides no other questions than such as  touch upon the capacity of the testator and the compliance with those requisites or solemnities which the law prescribes for the validity of wills.  It does not determine nor even by implication prejudge the validity or efficiency of the provisions; these may be impugned as being vicious or null, notwithstanding its authentication.  The questions relating to these points remain entirely unaffected, and may be raised even after the will has been authenticated.  This is not the case, however, with regard to the proper execution thereof, as in view of the fact that it constitutes the proper and special subject-matter therefor, it acquires by virtue thereof the character of res adjudicata, and can not in consequence be again brought into question, all judicial question in  connection therewith being for once and forever closed.  Such is the reason of the doctrine invoked by the appellant, which evidently is not susceptible of the interpretation which she seems to have attributed in her brief.<br\/><br\/>From  the fact that the  legalization of a will does not validate the provisions therein contained, it does not follow that such provisions lack the efficiency, or fail to produce the effects which the law recognizes when they are not impugned by anyone.  In the matter of wills it is a fundamental doctrine that the will of the testator is the law governing the interested parties, and must be punctually complied with in so far as  it is not contrary to the law  or to public morals.  With respect to the partition of the inheritance, there is the definite provision of law that when the testator makes such partition by an act <i>inter vivos<\/i> or by a last will, <i>it shall be accepted<\/i> in so far as it does not prejudice the legal portion of the heirs by force of law.  (Art. 1056, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>From this it follows that, as the testator, Montanano, had by his will partitioned his property and assigned to his son Catalino, as his portion, the lands in question herein, the said testamentary provision, being binding on the heirs, constitutes <i>prima facie<\/i> evidence that the said lands were actually inherited by Catalino, and not by the plaintiff herein; other property was assigned to her in payment of her legal portion.  Therefore, the trial judge committed no error of law when he considered said evidence in the sense that he has done, inasmuch as it has not been proven, nor has any attempt been made to prove that the said testamentary provision was impugned or annulled, or that it has ceased to be effective for any reason whatever.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed with the costs of this instance against the appellant.  So ordered.<br\/><br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres<\/i>, and <i>Carson, JJ<\/i>., concur.<\/div>",

Diaz, for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not the said mortgage executed by Dy Payco to the said Diaz was still subsisting as a lien against the property in question.<br\/><br\/>Fifth.\u00a0 The notary public inquired of the said Diaz concerning the\u00a0 said mortgage and the said Diaz replied with the statement that if Dy Payco would pay to him the sum of P2,000 that he would cancel said mortgage.<br\/><br\/>Sixth.\u00a0 The notary public and Dy Payco returned to the house of the former and informed the said Li Hang Sheong concerning the statements made by Venancio C. Diaz, whereupon and on the 2d day of August, 1904, the said <i>pacto de retro<\/i> by Dy Payco in favor of Li Hang Sheong was executed and delivered, and Li Hang Sheong paid to Dy Payco the sum of P4,000.<br\/><br\/>Seventh.\u00a0 Between the 1st day of August, 1904, and the 6th day of September, 1904 (see Exhibits C, D, and E), Dy Payco paid to Venancio C. Diaz the sum of P3,000.<br\/><br\/>Venancio C. Diaz claims that the said P3,000 was received by him and applied to the payment of a current account between himself and Dy Payco, and that it was not a payment or part payment of the said mortgage indebtedness.<br\/><br\/>Li Hang Sheong contends that, in accordance with the promise of Venancio C. Diaz, the said mortgage was canceled by virtue of the fact that Dy Payco had paid to him not only the sum of P2,000, in accordance with the agreement, but had actually paid the sum of P3,000, and that this sum should have been applied to the liquidation of the mortgage indebtedness.<br\/><br\/>On the 25th day of January, 1905, the said Venancio C. Diaz commenced an action in the Court of First Instance of the Province of Albay, for the purpose of recovering of the defendant, Dy Payco, the sum of P3,500, the amount due on the said promissory note, and to subject the parcel of land in question to the payment of the said indebtedness.\u00a0 The defendant, Dy Payco, answering the petition of the plaintiff (Venancio C. Diaz), set up the following fact:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"1. That the property described in paragraph 2 of the complaint which had been mortgaged to the plaintiff, was, with the latter's consent, sold by the defendant with <i>pacto de retro<\/i> to Ly Ang Sheung, a resident of Legaspi, the plaintiff\u00a0 binding himself to cancel the mortgage document, delivering at once to the defendant the title deeds of the property in order that he might sell the same to the said Li Ang Sheung, from which sale the plaintiff recovered P3,000.<br\/><br\/>\"In view of the foregoing, and without prejudice to the former answer, the defendant prays the court to declare the mortgage of the said property to the plaintiff to be canceled.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>After hearing the evidence adduced during the trial of that cause, the court found that the P3,000 which Dy Payco had paid to Venancio C. Diaz, was properly applied to the payment of the current account existing between them and decreed that the plaintiff, Venancio C. Diaz, was entitled to a judgment for the sum of P3,500, with interest at the rate of 10 per cent from the 1st of July, 1904, and ordered that if the defendant, Dy Payco, did not pay the said sum, with interest and costs, on or about the first days of the following term of the court, that the court would issue an order directing the sale of the property in question.<br\/><br\/>On the 31st of October, 1905, the plaintiff in this action, Li Hang Sheong, commenced an action in the Court of First Instance of the Province of Albay against the said Venancio C. Diaz, for the purpose of securing an\u00a0 annulment of that part of the sentence of the court authorizing the sale of the property in question, rendered in the case of Venancio C. Diaz <i>vs.<\/i> Dy Payco, and for the dissolution of the receivership in said case also.<br\/><br\/>After hearing the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause, the lower court rendered a judgment in favor of the defendant, Venancio C. Diaz, declaring that the said mortgage was valid and ordered that the said property be sold in order to pay the amount of the judgment rendered in the cause of Venancio C. Diaz <i>vs.<\/i> Dy Payco.<br\/><br\/>From\u00a0 this judgment of the lower court the plaintiff appealed and made several assignments of error.<br\/><br\/>The lower court in its decision argued that because of the fact that Li Hang Sheong had actual knowledge of the existence of the mortgage in favor of Venaneio C. Diaz at the time the former accepted the <i>pacto de retro<\/i> from the said By Payco, that he\u00a0 was bound by its terms and that said mortgage was an existing prior lien.\u00a0 That would be true, perhaps, if it were not for the fact which the evidence discloses, to wit, that he, Venancio C. Diaz, had agreed to cancel his mortgage upon said property when<br\/>Dy Payco should pay to him the sum of P2,000.\u00a0 This agreement on the part of Venancio C. Diaz was communicated to the said Li Hang Sheong by the notary public, who had gone iro the said Diaz, representing Li Hang Sheong, for the express purpose of ascertaining the character of the lien which he held against the property of Dy Payco.\u00a0 Relying upon this promise of Venancio C. Diaz to cancel the mortgage when P2,000 were paid he entered into the contract with Dy Payco and paid to him the sum of P4,000.\u00a0 When Dy Payco had paid to Venancio C. Diaz the sum of P2,000, Li Hang Sheong had a right to rely upon the fulfillment of the promise of Diaz, to wit, that the said mortgage would be canceled.\u00a0 Nothing is shown in the record as to why Venancio C. Diaz agreed to cancel his mortgage upon the payment of P2,000; the record does show, however, that he did agree to cancel his mortgage upon that condition.\u00a0 Not only was Diaz by virtue of his promise obliged to apply the payment to the liquidation of the mortgage but also by virtue of the provision of article 1174 of the Civil Code.\u00a0 The other account was a current account.<br\/><br\/>There is nothing in the record which shows that Li Hang Sheong knew of the pendency of the cause between Venancio C. Diaz and Dy Payco, brought for the purpose of foreclosing the said mortgage.\u00a0 In fact it is alleged by Li Hang Sheong that he had no knowledge whatever of the pendency of the said action.<br\/><br\/>From the record it is made clear to us that Li Hang Sheong entered into the said <i>pacto de retro<\/i> and paid Dy Payco the sum, of P4,000, relying upon the fact that the defendant, Venancio C. Diaz, had promised to cancel the said mortgage upon the payment of P2,000 by Dy Payco, and upon the promise that Dy Payco would pay the said sum of P2,000.\u00a0 This being true, we are of the opinion, and so hold, that the prayer of the petition of Li Hang Sheong in the present action should have been granted.<br\/><br\/>Much might be said upon the question of the effect of the failure of Venancio C. Diaz in not having his mortgage recorded, as well as the effect of the knowledge which Li Hang Sheong had concerning\u00a0 the existence of said mortgage and prior lien upon the property in question.\u00a0 The property in question was not registered in the name of Dy Payco.\u00a0 The mortgage could not, therefore, be recorded.\u00a0 But, whatever might be the conclusion from this discussion, we are of the opinion that Venancio C. Diaz agreed to cancel the said mortgage when he should receive the sum of P2,000 from Dy Payco, which sum he did actually receive, and even more, and that Li Hang Sheong entered into his contract with Dy Payco relying upon said agreement, and actually gave to Dy Payco the sum of P4,000 upon the said <i>pacto de retro<\/i>.\u00a0 Had Dy Payco not paid the agreed sum (P2,000), then a\u00a0 different question would be presented.\u00a0 It was the promise of Venancio C. Diaz which evidently induced Li Hang Sheong to part with his money and to enter into the said <i>pacto de retro<\/i>.\u00a0 Venancio C. Diaz should not now be allowed to prejudice Li Hang Sheong by violating that agreement.<br\/><br\/>Therefore the judgment of the lower court is hereby reversed and it is ordered and decreed that a judgment be entered annuling that part of the sentence of the lower court in the case No. 377 of that court, of Venancio C. Diaz <i>vs.<\/i> Emilio Samson Dy Payco,\u00a0 in which the lower court ordered that the property in question be sold for the purpose of satisfying the judgment of P3,500, with costs and interest against the said Dy Payco, and that the receivership in relation to said property be dissolved, with costs.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

EUSTASIO HERNANDEZ ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<sup style=\"COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup><br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>MORELAND, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">The defendants were charged with the crime of adultery in the Court of First Instance of the Province of Ambos Camarines.  They were tried upon that charge in that court and convicted and sentenced-the defendant Eustasio Hernandez to four years and nine months of <i>prision correccional<\/i>, and the defendant Catalina Mago to three years six months and twenty-one days of <i>prision correccional<\/i>, with the accessories mentioned in article 61 of the Penal Code, and each to pay one-half the costs of the action.  From that judgment of conviction and the sentence imposed there-under the defendants appealed to this court.<br\/><br\/>The defendant Eustasio Hernandez admits having had illicit relations with the defendant Catalina Mago, but presents as a defense against the criminality of such act the consent of the complainant, Mariano del Pilar, husband of said Catalina Mago.<br\/><br\/>The evidence in relation to the alleged consent is conflicting and upon such conflicting evidence the court below found that the evidence adduced by the defendants was insufficient to sustain the allegation of consent.  This court has carefully read the evidence in the record and can find no reason for disturbing the conclusions reached by the court below.  The evidence fully supports them.<br\/><br\/>Although it is not necessary to the decision of this case, still the court feels that it ought to say for future guidance that even if the consent of the spouse to the adulterous acts complained of had been obtained by the defendants, as they allege it was, such consent would not have been a defense in this action.  The substantive criminal law relating to adultery was changed materially by Act No. 1773 of the Philippine Commission.  That Act made adultery a public crime, to be prosecuted, with the exceptions therein named, in the same manner as other public crimes.  It destroyed entirely the right of condonation, pardon, and remission of penalty, except in specified instances.  Necessarily included in that result was the complete abrogation of the defense that the injured spouse had consented to the commission of the adulterous acts which composed the crime.  That such abrogation was necessarily involved in the change of the substantive law made by said Act, is evident at a glance.  Under prior law, condonation, pardon, and remission were the same in their legal nature and effect as the consent of the spouse to the commission of the adulterous acts.  They all resulted in absolution from criminal responsibility.  The vital and essential distinction between public and private crimes, as they were known under the former law, was the control which in private crimes the injured person had over the criminal liability and responsibility of the offending person.  Therefore, the real intent and purpose of the Legislature, in changing all private crimes into public crimes, was to abolish this distinction and thereby to take from every person injured by the criminal acts of another all control over the criminal liability and responsibility of the offending person-in other words, to prevent any person from remitting the criminal responsibility of another, regardless of whether that remission occurred before or after the commission of the act which constituted the crime.  The fact that, in some cases, the institution of the criminal proceedings under said Act rests wholly with the offended person, in nowise affects the intention and purpose of the Legisature as to the substantive law with which the Act deals.<br\/><br\/>Moreover, except in the presence of clear and express provision of statute to the contrary, it can not be permitted that any person produce any legal effect or work any legal result whatever in the criminal law against the paramount interests of the public by consenting to the commission of a crime by other persons.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below is, therefore, affirmed, with costs against the appellants.

that he was found in the city of Manila on the 12th day of November, 1907; that at that time he did not have in his possession a certificate of residence prescribed for such persons in the above-mentioned Act, and that he never has acquired such certificate.<br\/><br\/>The trial court found that Lim Co was born at Amoy, China; that he is about 30 years of age and came to the Philippine Islands about twenty-two years ago; that for a number of years and covering the period in which certificates of registration were being issued he was operating an opium store; that he gave up the opium store upon the change in the law in relation to the selling of opium, and operated a <i>pansiteria<\/i> in which he had invested P500; that he also has an interest in the manufacture and sale of vermicelli in which business he has invested the sum of P2,000; that the license for conducting the business is in the name of his partner, and that the partnership agreement, which is written in Chinese in the books of the firm, indicates that the business belongs to the defendant with his partner; and that the evidence is satisfactory to show that the defendant, Lim Co, is not a Chinese laborer; and that the certificate of registration required by Act No. 702 is not necessary to said Lim Co.<br\/><br\/>To this judgment and to the order overruling a motion for a new trial plaintiff excepted, and the case is now submitted to this court on plaintiff's bill of exceptions, to which no objection has been made either as\u00a0 to form or content.<br\/><br\/>The Act of Congress of April 29, 1902, entitled \"An Act to prohibit the coming into and to regulate the residence within the United States, its Territories, and all territory under its jurisdiction, and the District of Columbia, of Chinese and persons of Chinese descent,\" provides in section 1 as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"That all laws now in force prohibiting and regulating the coming of Chinese persons and persons of Chinese descent into the United States, and the residence of such persons therein, including sections five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, thirteen, and fourteen of the Act entitled 'An Act to prohibit the coming of Chinese laborers into the United States,' approved September thirteenth, eighteen hundred and eighty-eight, be, and the same are hereby reenacted, extended, and continued so far as the same are not inconsistent with treaty obligations, until otherwise provided by law, and said laws shall also apply to the island territory under the jurisdiction of the United States, and prohibit the immigration of Chinese laborers, not citizens of the United States, from such island territory to the mainland territory of the United States, whether in such island territory at the time of cession or not, and from one portion of the island territory of the United States to another portion of said island territory; <i>Provided, however<\/i>, That said laws shall not apply to the transit of Chinese laborers from one island to another island of the same group; and any islands within the jurisdiction of any State or the District of Alaska shall be considered a part of the mainland under this section.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Section 4 of said Act of Congress provides as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"That it shall be the duty of every Chinese laborer, other than a citizen, rightfully in and entitled to remain in any of the insular territory of the United States (Hawaii excepted) at the time of the passage of this Act, to obtain within one year thereafter a certificate of residence in the insular territory wherein he resides, which certificate shall entitle him to residence therein, and upon failure to obtain such certificate as herein provided he shall be deported from such insular territory; and the Philippine Commission is authorized and required to make all regulations and provisions necessary for the enforcement of this section in the Philippine islands, including the form and substance of the certificate of residence so that the same shall clearly and sufficiently identify the holder thereof and enable officials to prevent fraud in the transfer of the same; <i>Provided, however<\/i>, That if said Philippine Commission shall find that it is impossible to complete the registration herein provided for within one year from the passage of this Act, said Commission is hereby authorized and empowered to extend the time for such registration for a further period not exceeding one year.\" <\/blockquote> Pursuant to the authority conferred by Congress in the latter section, the Philippine Commission on March 27, 1903, passed Act No. 702, entitled \"An Act to regulate the registration of Chinese persons in the Philippine Archipelago, and to carry into effect and enforce the provisions of section four of the Act of Congress approved April twenty-ninth, nineteen hundred and two, entitled 'An Act to prohibit the coming into and to regulate the residence within the United States, its Territories, and all territory under its jurisdiction, and the District of Columbia, of Chinese persons\u00a0 and persons of Chinese descent.'\"<br\/><br\/>In section 3 of this Act it is provided as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Each certificate of registration shall contain the name, age, date, and place of birth, registry of birth, if any, local residence, occupation, and photograph of the person therein described, and\u00a0 such other data\u00a0 in respect to him as shall be prescribed by the Insular Collector of Customs, and shall be issued by the proper officer upon payment to him of a fee of fifty cents, United States currency, said fee to be accompanied by a true photograph of the applicant in triplicate to the satisfaction of such officer.\" <\/blockquote> Section 5 of the Act provides as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Every Chinese person having a right to be and remain in the Philippine Islands shall obtain the certificate of registration specified in\u00a0 section three of this Act as evidence of such right arid shall pay the fee and furnish his photograph in triplicate as in said section prescribed; and every Chinese person found without such certificate within the Philippine Islands after the expiration of the time limited by law for registration shall be presumed, in the absence of satisfactory proof to the contrary, to be a Chinese laborer and shall be subject to deportation as provided in section four of this Act.\u00a0 Every Chinese person shall, on demand of any customs official, police, Constabulary, or other peace officer, exhibit his certificate, and on his refusal to do so may be arrested and tried as provided in section four of this\u00a0 Act.\" <\/blockquote> Said section 4, above-mentioned, provides in\u00a0 part as follows:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"Any Chinese laborer within the limits of the Philippine Islands who shall neglect, fail, or refuse to obtain within\u00a0 he time prescribed by section four of the Act of Congress of the United States referred to in section one of this Act, the certificate of registration by this Act provided to be issued, and who shall be found within the Philippine Islands without such certificate of registration after such time has elapsed, may be arrested upon warrant issued by the Court of First Instance of the province or by the justice's court of the municipality returnable before said Court of First Instance, by any customs official, police, Constabulary, or other peace officer of the Philippine Islands and brought before any judge of a Court of First Instance in the Islands, whose duty it shall be to order that such Chinese laborer be deported from the Philippine Islands, either to China or the country from whence he came, unless he shall affirmatively establish clearly and to the satisfaction of such judge, by at least one credible witness other than Chinese, that although lawfully in the Philippine Islands at and ever since the passage of this Act he has been unable by reason of accident, sickness, or other unavoidable cause to procure the certificate within the time prescribed by law, in which case the court shall order and adjudge\u00a0 that lie procure the proper certificate within a reasonable time and such Chinese laborer shall bear and pay the costs of the proceeding:\u00a0 Provided, however, That any Chinese laborer failing for any reason to secure the certificate required under this law within two years from the date of its passage shall be deported from the Islands.\u00a0 If it appears that such Chinese laborer had procured a certificate in due time but that the same has been lost or destroyed, he shall be allowed a reasonable time to procure a duplicate from the Insular Collector of Customs or from the officer granting the original certificate, and upon the production of such duplicate such Chinese laborer shall be discharged from custody upon payment of costs.\" <\/blockquote> It will be seen that under the\u00a0 provisions of section 5 of Act No. 702, every Chinese person found without the' prescribed certificate after the expiration of the time limited by law for registration is presumed, in the absence of satisfactory proof to the contrary, to be a Chinese laborer, and is subject to deportation, as provided in the Act; in other words, in proceedings looking to the deportation of Chinese persons under the provisions of this section, the burden of proof rests upon the defendant to show that he is not a Chinese laborer.<br\/><br\/>Similar provisions in the Chinese Exclusion Act of May 5, 1892 (27 Stat. at L., 25) have been held valid.\u00a0 (Low Foon Yin <i>vs<\/i>. Commissioner of Immigration, 145 Fed. Rep., 791; see also U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Lung Hong, 105 Fed. Rep., 188; U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Sing Lee, 125 Fed. Rep., 627; U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Yee Gee You, 152 Fed. Rep., 157-159.)\u00a0 And it has been held that proceedings brought under the Chinese Exclusion Act for the deportation of a Chinese person are civil and not criminal (<i>In re<\/i> Lam Jung Sing, 150 Fed. Rep., 008); and that the facts constituting the defense in such cases are peculiarly within the knowledge of the party charged, and the burden of proof is naturally placed upon him.\u00a0 (<i>In re<\/i> Sing Lee and <i>In re<\/i> Ching Jo, 54 Fed. Rep., 334.)\u00a0 Reference to these cases appears to furnish a sufficient answer to contentions based upon the constitutionality of the provisions of the Act in this regard.<br\/><br\/>Defendant and appellee does not deny that he is a Chinese person or that he was found, as alleged in the complaint, in the city of Manila, on the 12th day of November, 1907, without the certificate prescribed in the above-cited provisions of law for persons of his race and citizenship; but he denies that he is a Chinese laborer, alleging that he is a merchant and that he is now and has been ever since the passage of the Act lawfully in the Philippine Islands, but that he was unable, by reason of sickness and other unavoidable causes, to procure a certificate within the time prescribed by law.<br\/><br\/>The evidence introduced at the trial in support of defendant's allegations consists of the testimony of the defendant himself, and of the witnesses, Adriano Cabuncal, Ng Tao, Lim Tao, and Ng Kim Till.<br\/><br\/>The defendant swore that he had a <i>pansiteria<\/i> store at 209 Calle Lavezares, and that he is a partner in a vermicelli factory at No. 75 Calle Ilaya; that the <i>pansiteria<\/i> store is worth P500; that his share in the vermicelli factory is worth P2,000; that he has been in the business and connected with these stores about four years; that the <i>pansiteria<\/i> is a Chinese \"chow house\" or a restaurant where cooked food is sold; that the vermicelli factory is a <i>camarin<\/i> (warehouse) where vermicelli is manufactured; that vermicelli is prepared as a food; that there are three kinds of vermicelli made out of flour; that the license for the factory is in the name of his partner, and that the business is conducted not in his own name but in the name of his partner; that in the Chinese book it appears that the witness is a partner although the business is not conducted in his name, but in the name of another Chinaman; that the witness does not buy and sell merchandise in this vermicelli factory, but that the factory is conducted by his companion; that the license is not in his name because he has not had a picture taken, that is to say, he has not a certificate of registration; that he has no certificate of any kind either as a merchant or as a laborer, although he has been in the Philippine Islands for twenty years and has been living in Manila all the time; that the only reason he did not get a registration certificate was that he was sick with <i>beri-beri<\/i> in the years 1903 and 1904; that he was born at Chincan, China.\u00a0 On examination by the court defendant stated that he had an opium store about five years ago, but that he closed that business as soon as the Americans commenced regulating that business, as it was too troublesome, and that he had about P1,500 invested in the opium business at that time; on cross-examination lie stated that the opium store was both for selling and smoking opium, and that the people who patronized it came in and paid for the opium and smoked it on the premises, but on redirect examination by his counsel he testified that he sold opium to people who smoked on the premises and also to people who carried it away.<br\/><br\/>Adriano Cabuncal testified that lie is a plumber at the market; that he has known the defendant Lim Co ever since Spanish times; that lie knew him when he had a store in the pueblo of Arayat; that the defendant now has a store of <i>pansit (pansiteria)<\/i>, and a vermicelli factory; that he could not state the value of the store.\u00a0 On cross-examination he stated that all he knew about the <i>pansiteria<\/i> business is that occasionally he goes and buys and eats there; that there are many kinds of <i>pansit<\/i>; that there is <i>glug glug<\/i> which is eaten with sauce, and<i> pansit<\/i> eaten with soup; that it is a food prepared to eat, which anyone can buy at the <i>pansiteria<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>Ng Tao testified that he had lived in Manila for more than sixteen years; that he has known the Chinaman Lim Co for about the same time; that Lim Co dealt in opium; that he went to the provinces as a trader, but that he now has a vermicelli factory and a <i>pansiteria<\/i>; that, in the opinion of the witness, the <i>pansiteria<\/i> is worth about P500; that Lim Co has an interest of about P2,000 in the vermicelli factory; that in the <i>camarin<\/i> a large business is done manufacturing vermicelli and selling it to all the stores; that Lim Co works in the <i>pansiteria<\/i>, but he does not work in the vermicelli factory but pays the laborers; that he is a partner and it is not necessary for him to work there; that Lim Co is what might be called the head man and sees that the laborers work, and pays them; that once the witness went to the factory to buy vermicelli and saw Lim Co there, and that he seemed to be a kind of head man; that at times when he saw Lim Co he was weighing the <i>mishwa<\/i>, and placing it in large boxes; that the <i>pansiteria<\/i> is a shop where you sit down, and that Lim Co collects the money from those who go there and eat.<br\/><br\/>Ng Kim Tiu testified that he has known this Chinaman, Lim Co, since Spanish times; that Lim Co has a <i>pansiteria<\/i> and is witness' partner in a vermicelli factory; that his business is worth about P6,000 and Lim Co's share is about P2,000; that he is mentioned in the Chinese books as the partner of the witness; that there are four books in the store, a book for the partnership, a book of daily sales, a book of those people who owe the firm, and a book for the workmen; that the vermicelli business is conducted in the name of the witness, Ng Kim Tiu, and the license for the business is in his name, as also are all the books pertaining to the business; that he has now no company name and none of the business is done in the name of the defendant Lim Co.\u00a0 Over the objection of counsel for the plaintiff, the following question was asked:\u00a0 \"Who appears in the books of\u00a0 your business as owning it?\" to which witness replied:\u00a0 \"In the\u00a0 Chinese book it appears that he (defendant) is a partner and has a share, but the license could not be taken in his name because he has not a picture like me.\"\u00a0 It further appears from the record that this witness produced a\u00a0 certificate as a Chinese laborer, and that his license, No. 1095, is issued in the name of Ng Kim Tiu, and purports to be a manufacturer's license.<br\/><br\/>The finding of the trial court that the defendant operates a <i>pansiteria<\/i> in which he has invested P500, and that he has an interest in the manufacture and sale of vermicelli, in which business he has invested the sum of 2,000, is not satisfactorily established by the testimony of record; and there is no competent evidence in the record in support of the finding that \"the partnership agreement, which is written in Chinese, indicates that the business belongs to the defendant with his partner.\"\u00a0 The evidence with which the defendant undertakes to establish his allegations, that he is the owner of a <i>pansiteria<\/i> worth P500 and that he has an interest of P2,000 in a vermicelli factory is unconvincing and unsatisfactory.\u00a0 We do not think that the owner of such property, situated in the city of Manila, would have failed to introduce more satisfactory proof of these allegations, in proceedings looking to his deportation from the Islands, if these allegations were true, for it would appear that strong and convincing proof must have been easily available, and might readily have been produced in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, in which city the store and factory are said to be located.\u00a0 The only evidence introduced in support of these allegations consists of the verbal declarations of the defendant himself and of his alleged partner.\u00a0 The testimony of the other witnesses that they had seen the defendant working in and about the store and factory does not support the truth of the allegations that he was owner or part owner of these establishments.\u00a0 The verbal testimony as to the contents of the alleged partnership books was clearly incompetent and inadmissible over the objection of the plaintiff, not being the <i>best evidence<\/i> as to the truth of the contents thereof.\u00a0 This\u00a0 secondary evidence should not have been admitted over the objection of counsel for the United States, which was interposed in due time; and in our opinion the trial court undoubtedly erred in admitting this testimony and in refusing to accede to the motion of counsel for plaintiff to compel the defendant to bring the books into court.\u00a0 The burden of proof resting upon the defendant, it would seem that he should have offered the books in evidence, if he conceived that they could, or would sustain any of his material allegations, and his failure so to do after their production had been called for, justifies the presumption that, if introduced in evidence, they would not have supported defendant's allegations.<br\/><br\/>But disregarding the question of the inadmissibility of some of the testimony, and granting that the statements of the defendant and his witnesses could be accepted as satisfactory evidence in this case, such evidence is not in our opinion sufficient to sustain the ultimate conclusion of fact by the trial court that Lim Co is a \"merchant\" and not a \"Chinese laborer.\"\u00a0 There is no evidence whatever in the record to show that the <i>pansiteria<\/i> was conducted in the name of the defendant; and it affirmatively appears that the vermicelli factory was not conducted in the name of the defendant but in the name of his alleged\u00a0 partner, and that the license therefor was also in the name of the alleged partner.\u00a0 The term \"merchant,\" as defined in the Act, is limited to a person engaged in buying and selling merchandise at a fixed place of business, <i>which business is conducted in his name<\/i>, and the defendant having wholly failed to prove that either the <i>pansiteria<\/i> or vermicelli factory is conducted in his own name, he must be presumed, under the provisions of section 5, to be a Chinese laborer and subject to deportation, as provided in section 4, since it is not denied that he is a Chinese person found without the prescribed certificate within the Philippine Islands, after the expiration of the time limited by law for registration.<br\/><br\/>We are satisfied that the meaning which we have given to the words \"Chinese laborer\" and \"Chinese merchant,\" as used\u00a0 in the Act of the Commission, is in conformity with the express provisions of the Act itself; and it will be found that a similar meaning has been given these words as used in the Chinese Exclusion Acts of the Congress of the United States by the Federal courts of the United States and the rulings and regulations of the Treasury Department, which, by the express provisions of section 12 of the Act, are made authoritative guides as to the definition which should be given these terms in this jurisdiction.<br\/><br\/>In the case of U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Chung Ki Foon (83 Fed. Rep., 143, 144) it was held that \"Chinese laborers,\" as used in Act of November 3, 1893 (c. 14, sec. 1, 28 Stat., 7, U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 1322), relating to certificates of residence, \"refer not only to those actually engaged in manual labor at the date of the\u00a0 passage of that Act, but were intended to include all Chinese persons dependent upon their manual labor as a means\u00a0 f securing an honest livelihood and self-support, <i>and those who are not 'officers, teachers, students, merchants, or travelers for curiosity,'<\/i> within the meaning of the treaty of November 17, 1880, between the United States and China.\"<br\/><br\/>In the case of U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Pin Kwan (100 Fed. Rep., 609) it was held that proof \"that a Chinese person, since he came to the United States, has been assisting in the business of a mercantile company, keeping the books and selling the goods, and that he has an interest in the stock of goods of such company, is insufficient to establish his status as a merchant within\u00a0 the statute.\"<br\/><br\/>In the case of U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Chung Ki Foon (83 Fed. Rep., 143, 144) it was held that \"the words, 'Chinese laborers,' in the Act of November 3, 1893 (28 Stat. 7, sec. 1), amending the Act of May 5, 1892 (27 Stat. 25, sec. 6), and relating to certificates of residence, included a Chinaman engaged in the business of keeping a restaurant and lodging house, and all Chinese persons, dependent upon their labor for support whether actually employed as laborers or not.\"<br\/><br\/>In the case of U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Quan Gin (61 Fed. Rep., 395) it was held that under the statute not only must the business be conducted in the Chinese person's own name, but that a Chinese person seeking admission upon the ground that he was a returning merchant must be excluded where it appears that the business was conducted under a firm name of which his own\u00a0 name was no part.\u00a0 In that case there was evidence that the defendant was a partner and that Chinese persons do not in general conduct business in individual or partnership names, but the court said (p. 397):<br\/><blockquote>\"It is contended in opposition to this view of the law, that such an interpretation will exclude nearly every Chinese merchant seeking to enter the United States, since, as before stated, it is claimed that Chinese merchants do not, as a rule, conduct their business affairs in individual or partnership names.\u00a0 This may be so, but if it is so, it is a consideration to be addressed to the lawmaking power and not to the court.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>And referring to an opinion of the Attorney-General of the United States, dated April 6, 1904, the court further said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The Attorney-General gives a most convincing reason for his interpretation of the statute.\u00a0 He says:<br\/><br\/>\" 'This requirement that a merchant must conduct a business in his own name can have but one purpose, to wit, that he who is a merchant in fact shall also be known to be such by the parties with whom he deals and by the public generally.\u00a0 That purpose could readily be defeated if it were possible to conceal his identity by trading under an assumed name, or under the disguise of a \"Co.\"'<br\/><br\/>\"When it is considered how easy it is for a Chinese person seeking admission into the United States to claim a small interest in the business of buying and selling merchandise, it is\u00a0 evident that the statute has been wisely framed to prevent the admission of Chinese persons into the United States upon the fictitious and fraudulent claim that they are merchants.\u00a0 In my opinion, therefore, when an application is made by a Chinaman for entrance into the United States on the ground that he was formerly engaged in business in this country as a merchant, he must, before being admitted, establish by the testimony of two credible witnesses, other than Chinese, among other things, that he conducted the business in which he was engaged, either in his own name, or in a firm name of which his own is a part.\" <\/blockquote> The Department of Commerce and Labor of the United States (to which by Act of Congress the final decision of administrative appeals from rulings of immigration officers has been transferred from the Treasury Department) ruled on May 18, 1904, as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Another and more important reason exists, however, for the denial of the appellant, to wit:\u00a0 According to his own sworn statement, the Canton firm in which he claims membership is engaged in the <i>manufacture<\/i> of 'black-wood furniture,' a circumstance which removes him from the mercantile class as contemplated by the Chinese Exclusion Law.\u00a0 Upon this point see department decision of\u00a0 December 7, 1903 (No. 10723-C), and December 14, 1903 (No. 9774-C), in the last mentioned of which the following passage is quoted from the decision rendered February 18, 1895, in the Lai Moy case, by the United States Circuit Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit (66. F. R., 955) :<br\/><br\/><i>\" 'The designation \"merchant\" does not include, comprehensively, all who are not laborers, but strictly \"A person (to quote the Act) engaged in buying and selling merchandise.\"<\/i>\u00a0 To fabricate merchandise as appellant did, is not to buy and sell it.\u00a0 Nor may both be done, for the \"merchant\" may not (again to quote the Act) \"engage in the performance of any manual labor except such as is necessary in the conduct of his business as such merchant;\" that is, in buying and selling merchandise; and the manual labor which is precluded is skilled as well as unskilled.'\" <\/blockquote> It has been suggested that while the defendant failed to offer affirmative proof that he conducted the <i>pansiteria<\/i> or restaurant in his own name, nevertheless, in view of the fact that he testified that he is the owner of the <i>pansiteria<\/i> and that no evidence was introduced in rebuttal of this testimony, the fact that the business was conducted in the name of the defendant might fairly be presumed from hie claim of ownership thereto.\u00a0 We do not think that this contention is well founded since the burden of proof to establish the fact that he is a merchant, is placed upon the defendant merchant by the express provisions of law, and especially in view of his own statement that the reason the vermicelli factory was not conducted in his name was that he could not secure a license because he had no certificate of registration.\u00a0 It may fairly be presumed that the same reason\u00a0 would have prevented him from obtaining a license for the <i>pansiteria<\/i>, and indeed we are satisfied that if it had been conducted in his own name he would have said so.<br\/><br\/>But even were it true that he owned and conducted in his own name a Chinese restaurant or \"chow house,\" worth at his own estimate about P500, we do not think that fact would make him a merchant within the meaning of the term as used in the Act.\u00a0 The proprietor of a small eating house where raw food is cooked and served upon the premises can hardly be said to be engaged in buying and selling merchandise.\u00a0 He is in truth no more than a skilled laborer and is not entitled to the privileges accorded \"merchants\" under the Act.<br\/><blockquote>\"A restaurant proprietor, who keeps a place for serving meals, and provides, prepares, and cooks raw materials to suit the tastes of his patrons, is a laborer, and is not privileged to enter the United States as a merchant.\"\u00a0 (<i>In re<\/i> Ah Yow, 59 Fed. Rep., 561.)<br\/><br\/>\"A Chinese man, who owns an interest in a mercantile firm, but is not actively engaged in the conduct of its business, and who works as head cook in a restaurant, of which he is a part proprietor, is a laborer, and not a merchant, within the terms of the Act of November 3, 1893 (28 Stat, 8).\"\u00a0 (Mar Bing Guey <i>vs<\/i>.

AGAPITO ZIALCITA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>ARELLANO, C.J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">Patricio Ubeda, owner of the registered trade-mark <i>\"Ginebra Tres Companas\"<\/i> claims and alleges loss and damages by reason of the imitation of his trademark by the defendant, who has been selling gin\u00a0 in bottles bearing said trade-mark, and using a label\u00a0 design that greatly resembles his; that thetonly difference between them is that of the defendant, instead of bearing the words <i>\"Ginebra Tres Campanas,\"<\/i> reads <i>\"Ginebra de Dos Campanas,\"<\/i> and in the center thereof, instead of <i>\"Patricio Ubeda,\"<\/i> it reads <i>\"Gavino Barreto;\"<\/i> that the remainder of the trade-mark is a copy of his own; and that as the defendant, the plaintiff avers, has thus sold gin to the value of not less than P50,000, from which he has obtained a profit of P10,000, the plaintiff's sales have decreased by that amount and he has failed to receive the said profit of P10,000 which he would have obtained if he had made such sales.\u00a0 In conclusion he prayed that the defendant be ordered to account for all sales made by him of gin put up in bottles bearing the trade-mark, design, or any of the distinctive marks belonging to the plaintiff, and that, after the extent of such sales has been ascertained, the said defendant be ordered to pay the plaintiff double the amount thereof as indemnity for loss and damages; that the defendant be forever prohibited from using the device or trade-mark of the plaintiff, or any other trade-mark or design bearing any resemblance to those\u00a0 of the plaintiff, and that he be sentenced to pay the costs of the proceeding.<br\/><br\/>The defendant, Agapito Zialcita, opposed the demand for various reasons which he advanced as a special denial to the complaint, and the Court of First Instance of Manila, after hearing the evidence adduced at the trial, absolved him from the complaint filed by the plaintiff herein, Patricio Ubeda, with the costs against the latter.\u00a0 The plaintiff appealed from the judgment and moved for a new trial; his motion was overruled, to which motion he excepted, and submitted a bill of exceptions to this court for the purposes of his appeal and a review of the facts and evidence offered in the first instance.<br\/><br\/>On the appeal it appears:<br\/><br\/>That the plaintiff is the owner of a trade-mark described in the third clause of his complaint as:<br\/><blockquote>\"Two concentric circles, the larger fifty millimeters in diameter,\u00a0 and the smaller thirty-three, eight millimeters apart.\u00a0 In the upper part of the\u00a0 ring formed by the imposition of one circle over the other, are the words <i>'Ginebra de Tres Campanas'<\/i> and in the lower part, the name of the plaintiff, <i>'Patricio Ubeda.<\/i>'\u00a0 Inside the smaller or center ring there are three bells, tied together at the top by a ribbon, and an ear of some cereal, the ends of which fall over the two posterior and lateral bells.\u00a0 On the lower part of said bells the words <i>'Extra Superior<\/i>' are written.\u00a0 Above the two circles and almost diametrically crossing them, the facsimile of the signature and rubric of the plaintiff, that is <i>'Patricio Ubeda,'<\/i> is stamped in black ink; said facsimile commences on the three first letters of the word <i>'Ginebra,'<\/i> and ends at the letter 'P' of the word <i>'Campanas,<\/i>' crossing the three bells; the rubric terminates on the lower part of the bell at the right of the other two, viewed from the front, though skirting it a little at the left.\u00a0 Outside, and above the larger ring, are the following words in small print:\u00a0 '<i>Para evitar la falsificacion, nuestras etiquetas se hallan\u00a0 depositadas y llevan nuestra firma.'<\/i>\u00a0 (To prevent falsification, our labels are registered and bear our signature), and below and also outside is the word <i>'Manila.' \"<\/i><br\/><\/blockquote>That said mark was registered at the office of the late <i>Direccion General de Administracion Civil<\/i> of the Spanish Government on December 24, 1898; that on July 31, 1905, the plaintiff cautioned the defendant to stop using a mark similar to his own, but, notwithstanding the warning, the defendant continued to use said mark; that the defendant, in addition to a general denial in his answer, alleged as a special defense:\u00a0 (1) That no similarity or resemblance exists between the trade-marks used by him and those of the plaintiiff; (2) that long prior to 1880, the distinctive device or trade-mark <i>\"Ginebra de la Campana\"<\/i> of Van Den Bergh &amp; Co. was entered and registered in the old <i>Direccion General de Administracion Civil<\/i>, at present the division of patents, copyrights, and trade-marks of the Executive Bureau, which trade-mark is similar to or greatly resembles the one described by the plaintiff in his complaint; and (3) that the device now used by the plaintiff, which is different from that registered by him, is also another falsification of that of Van Den Bergh &amp; Co., and which he managed to register by taking advantage of the first days of the American occupation of the city\u00a0 of Manila; said plaintiff has been using both marks, one after the other, for the purpose of defrauding and deceiving the public as to the nature, origin, and properties of his gin, mixing it with that of Van Den Bergh &amp; Co., and thus selling a cheap product at the same price as the gin of Van Den Bergh &amp; Co., which, for the reason that it is imported from Europe, costs more than his.<br\/><br\/>The imitation charged by the plaintiff to the defendant was the subject of argument and proof, in the consideration of which the judgment appealed from deals at length; but for the purposes of the law, the following conclusions contained in the said judgment suffice to determine the question :<br\/><blockquote>\"First.\u00a0 That the title of ownership of the plaintiff, Exhibit A, was issued to the plaintiff on December 16, 1898, for a trade-mark which is not exactly the same as the one described in the complaint, because, although the said titles or trade-marks bear the same circular form, and around the two concentric circles the words <i>'Patricio Ubeda,' 'Ginebra de Tres Campanas'<\/i> and <i>'Extra Superior'<\/i> appear, and on the outside are the words <i>'para evitar la falsificacion nuestras etiquetas se hallan depositadas y llevan nuestra firma,'<\/i> and the center is of a gold color, which is the color of the entire label <i>'Tres Campanas,'<\/i> and the signature <i>'Patricio Ubeda'<\/i> in black, yet on the lower part of said label, outside of the larger circle of the trade-mark is seen the word <i>'Amberes,'<\/i> (Antwerp), whereas on the other, in lieu thereof is printed the word <i>'Manila;'<\/i> this difference was explained at the trial as follows:\u00a0 That the said title was issued to the plaintiff to sell gin in these Islands imported from Antwerp, with the said label, but not manufactured by the plaintiff as stated in his complaint; the difference between the registered trade-mark and the other is also noticeable because on the latter the words or legends previously described are not embossed, nor is the gold coloring in the one of the same shade as in the other.<br\/><br\/>\"Second.\u00a0 That on the other hand there appears from the certified copy, Exhibit 8, that a certificate was issued on the 11th of December, 1873, by the <i>Ministerio de Fomento<\/i> in Spain to Van Den Bergh &amp; Co., manufacturers of wines at Antwerp, according them the use of the mark <i>'Ginebra de la Campana, Van Den Bergh &amp; Co.'<\/i> with the right to use said trade-mark in Spanish territory and foreign possessions; said mark appears as Exhibit 3, and bears a great resemblance to Exhibit A, the title of ownership of which, according to said exhibit, was issued to said plaintiff by the aforesaid <i>Direccion General de Administracion Civil<\/i>; the only difference between the two trade-marks being that three bells are printed on that of the plaintiff, in the center of the two circles, with the signature of Patricio Ubeda in black ink crossing the two circles, while that of Exhibit 3 has only one bell inside the circles, with the signature of Van Den Bergh &amp; Co. crossing the said circles; there has been and there still is on sale in this market bottled gin bearing the said trade-mark, as was also proven at the trial; said trade-mark was registered in the Bureau of Archives in November, 1903, in view of the fact that no record could be found of the registration of the trade-mark <i>'Tres Campanas,'<\/i> and for the reason that said trade-mark of Van Den Bergh &amp; Co. had already been registered in the United States.<br\/><br\/>\"Third.\u00a0 That the similarity existing between the trade-mark <i>'Ginebra dela Campana, Van Den Bergh &amp; Co.,'<\/i> and the trade-mark <i>'Ginebra de tres Campanas Patricio Ubeda'<\/i> under the circumstances mentioned with respect to the registration or issuance of the title of ownership of the second of the said trade-marks in favor of the plaintiff, should be taken into account for the due appreciation of the acts of the parties herein, and their respective rights in this litigation, because it\u00a0 all tends to explain in some way the conduct of the defendant * * * and at the same time shows that all the trade-marks bearing more or less bells, familiar to the trade here on gin bottles, are nothing more than a variation of the mark <i>'Ginebra de la Campana, Van Den Bergh &amp; Co.,'<\/i> or bear some resemblance thereto, and shows that if it was a matter of judging simply from the similarity or resemblance between two trade-marks, the plaintiff has no right to charge the defendant with being a competitor in bad faith for having used the trade-mark <i>'Dos Campanas.'\"<\/i><br\/><\/blockquote>In effect, the following communication received by the plaintiff on the 12th of December, 1898, from the <i>Direccion General de Administracion Civil,<\/i> is one of the documents offered by him as a preliminary title:<br\/><blockquote>\"By a resolution of the 5th inst. * * * this <i>Direccion General<\/i> has been pleased to grant you the ownership of the inclosed trade-mark for wines denominated <i>Tres Campanas,'<\/i> of which you are the importer in this market, upon payment of the corresponding fees.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>But the said trade-mark reads on the outside lower part, <i>\"Amberes\"<\/i> and in diminutive characters toward the right hand bears the lithographer's name, <i>\"Litografia Ramirez y Ca., Madrid.\"<\/i>\u00a0 So that the license granted him was for the use of an <i>Antwerp<\/i> trade-mark, for gin <i>imported<\/i> into these Islands, while the trade-mark described in the complaint as being imitated, is one for gin <i>manufactured<\/i> in these Islands, for which the license granted was not obtained; and according to a certificate of the Bureau of Archives of this Government, there is only one entry on file, as follows:<br\/><blockquote><i>\"Registro Publico y General de Comercio<\/i>.-Section 2, folio 3, 8.-Under date of December 16, 1898, His Excellency, the Governor-General, issued a title of ownership of a trade-mark in favor of Don Patricio Ubeda Gallego, as <i>importer<\/i> in this market of the wine denominated <i>'Tres Campanas.' \"<\/i><br\/><\/blockquote>This entry is not exactly that of the title, Exhibit A, issued on the 16th of December, 1898, but of its recording in the division of\u00a0 agriculture, industry, and commerce of the said <i>Direccion<\/i> which actually appears under entry No. 8 on folio 3 of the second register of industrial and commercial trade-marks, dated December 24, 1898.<br\/><br\/>On December 2, 1904, in reply to a communication from Van Den Bergh &amp;\u00a0 Co. of Antwerp, Patricio Ubeda told the said gentlemen that he was the proprietor of the trade-mark <i>\"Ginebra Tres Campanas\"<\/i> for the Philippine Islands under entry No. 8, folio 3, of the second register of industrial and commercial trade-marks.<br\/><br\/>Upon comparing the trade-mark that appears at the foot of the title of ownership presented by the plaintiff, and which bears the\u00a0 word <i>\"Amberes\"<\/i> on the lower outer part thereof with the real and undisputed mark of Van Den Bergh &amp; Co., of Antwerp, also bearing the said word upon the lower outer part, it is found that the description given in clause 3 of the complaint applies to the salient features of both, and that when viewed from a distance they appear alike; even to the characters used in the respective autographs stamped across both marks, the resemblance is perfect, and the type employed in the legend, the caution, class, and place of origin is the same in both.\u00a0 So that it may be said of Van Den Bergh &amp; Co's trade-mark (Exhibit 3), as of that of Patricio Ubeda's (Exhibit A):\u00a0 Two concentric circles, the larger of 50 millimeters in diameter and the smaller 33, 8 millimeters apart.\u00a0 On the lower part of the bell the words <i>\"Extra Superior\"<\/i> are written.\u00a0 Above the two circles and almost diametrically crossing them, the facsimile of the signature and rubric of Van Den Bergh &amp; Co. is stamped in black ink; said facsimile commences on the <i>first letter<\/i> of the word <i>\"Ginebra\"<\/i> and ends at the letter \"P\" of the word <i>\"Campana.\"<\/i>\u00a0 Outside and above the larger ring and in small letters (identical in both) are the following words; <i>\"Para evitar la falsificacion nuestras etiquetas se hallan depositadas y llevan nuestra firma.\"<\/i>\u00a0 Below, and also outside, is the word <i>\"Amberes,\"<\/i> of the same\u00a0 type and size (in both trade-marks), not <i>\"Manila\"<\/i> as described in clause 3 of the complaint.\u00a0 The whole of the substitution consists of <i>\"Tres Campanas\"<\/i> for <i>\"La Campana\" <\/i>and <i>\"Patricio Ubeda\"<\/i> in lieu of <i>\"Van Den Bergh &amp; Co.,\"<\/i> both in the text and the signature; all are\u00a0 of the same color, and, viewed from a certain distance as a whole, of exactly the same appearance; in other words such a mark as is applied to a bottle of characteristic design as that used for putting up gin.<br\/><br\/>The conclusion contained in the judgment appealed from, \"that all the labels with more or less companas (bells) used in this\u00a0 market\u00a0 on gin bottles are nothing more than a variation of the trade-mark <i>'Ginebra de la Camptana, Van Den Bergh &amp; Co.,'<\/i> or bear a great resemblance thereto,\" is Correct.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff presents a registered trade-mark which can be seen at the foot of the title of ownership obtained for imported gin.\u00a0 According to the registered mark it would be gin imported from Antwerp.\u00a0 As the plaintiff was well aware, this mark existed here, although he says he was given to understand that the copyright had expired.\u00a0 Ernest Appel, of the firm of C. Heinszen &amp; Co. of this city, testified that he did not know when the <i>\"Ginebra de Una Campana\"<\/i> was first imported in these Islands, but, according to the books of said firm, which is the importer of it, the latter received a shipment of 500 cases on the 15th of January, 1892.<br\/><br\/>The trade-mark of this gin was produced in evidence (Exhibit\u00a0 No. 3) prior to that of the plaintiff which, as stated by the latter \"was registered in Spain,\" and he believed that it existed in the Islands, according to his declaration at folio 19 of the record all the objection raised against its admission was based, first, in that the plaintiff did not derive any right from the mark of Van Den Bergh &amp; Co.; second, in that said mark was not valid in the Philippines, because at the time when that of the plaintiff was registered the\u00a0 defendant had no right therein for the reason that any right which he might have possessed had expired; and third, in that this matter was foreign to the suit between the plaintiff and the defendant as <i>res inter olios acta<\/i>.\u00a0 Thus he assigns as error in the judgment \"in admitting as proof the certificate issued in 1873 by the <i>Ministerio de Fomento<\/i> of Spain to Van Den Bergh &amp; Co. for the use of the mark' <i>'Ginebra de la Campana.'\"<\/i>\u00a0 (Brief, 2.)\u00a0 He added:<br\/><blockquote>\"So that although it be considered\u00a0 that the plaintiff's mark is an imitation of that of Van Den Bergh &amp; Co., yet from the fact that the mark of the latter had lapsed, it is evident that since 1898 the plaintiff was the only one who could lawfully use the mark <i>'Ginebra Tres Campanas,'<\/i> and all other variations of the same were illegal * * *\u00a0 In the said year 1898, apart from the said double expiration (through prescription of ownership and use) of the trade-mark <i>'Ginebra de la Campana'<\/i> no one claimed to have any right thereto,, and consequently the plaintiff, like any other person, could ask for, and the ownership could be granted him, not of a mark similar to that of Van Den Bergh &amp; Co., but one exactly the same as the mark <i>'Ginebra de la Campana,<\/i>' and the grantee could not be charged with bad faith.\"\u00a0 (Brief, 7 and 8.)<br\/><\/blockquote>But by sections of Act No, 666:<br\/><blockquote>\"No action, or suit, or criminal prosecution shall be maintained under the provisions of this Act * * * in any case where the trade-mark, trade-name, or the indicia of origin, ownership, or manufacture have been used by the complaining and injured party for the purpose of himself deceiving the public with respect to the character of the merchandise sold by him or of the business or profession or occupation carried on by him.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>This is one of the defenses utilized by the defendant so far as he alleged that a party who had imitated the trade-mark of another could hardly be entitled to bring an action for an imitation of his own.\u00a0 If, as claimed by the plaintiff, the mark <i>\"Dos Campanas\"<\/i> used by the defendant, is an imitation and a variation of his own trade-mark <i>\"Tres Campanas,\"<\/i> it is\u00a0 illegitimate and illegal, and the conduct of the person using the said imitation is deceitful and fraudulent and subject to an action for unlawful competition; it follows that the mark <i>\"Tres Campanas,\"<\/i> of the plaintiff, being an imitation and a variation of the mark <i>\"La Campana\"<\/i> of Van Den Bergh &amp; Co., is\u00a0 also illegitimate and illegal, and the conduct of the plaintiff is in turn deceitful and fraudulent and gives rise to an action for unlawful competition.\u00a0 And being deceitful and fraudulent, that is to say, inasmuch as the petitioner, who claims to be the injured party, made use of the mark <i>\"Tres Campanas\"<\/i> for the purpose of deceiving the public with respect to the character of the merchandise sold by him, pretending, under the title of ownership produced in evidence, to cause it to pass as imported from Antwerp when it was manufactured in Manila, as he has testified in this case, he can not, under the provisions of said section 9, exercise any right of action or sue for what he claims in his complaint.<br\/><br\/>Neither through the lack of registration of the trade-mark of Van Den Bergh &amp; Co. nor by reason of the expiration of the copyright for its use, could the plaintiff consider himself at liberty to freely and with impunity use the same.\u00a0 Section 4 of the said Act reads as follows:<br\/><br\/>\"In order to justify recovery for violation of trade-mark rights in the preceding sections defined, it shall not be necessary to show that the trade-marks have been registered under the royal decree of 1888, providing for registration of trade-marks in the Philippine Islands, in force during the Spanish sovereignty in these Islands, nor shall it be necessary to show that the trade-mark has been registered under this Act.\u00a0 It shall be sufficient to invoke protection of his property in a trade-mark if the party complaining shall prove that he had used the trade-mark claimed by him upon his goods a sufficient length of time so that the use of the trade-mark by another would be an injury to him and calculated to deceive the public into the belief that the goods of that other were the goods manufactured or dealt in by the complaining party.\"<br\/><br\/>The fact that both have fraudulently imitated the trade-mark of a third person, one which antedated both of theirs, and which with variations was copied in\u00a0 order to sell as <i>\"La Campana\"<\/i> gin from Antwerp, those gins which the one and the other have offered the public under the trade-marks of <i>\"Dos Campanas\"<\/i> and <i>\"Tres Companas,\"<\/i> can not be considered <i>res inter alios acta<\/i> for the foundation of an action between the plaintiff and the defendant.\u00a0 The usurpation of a trade-mark by means of an imitation is punished by law; and this is what the plaintiff puts forward as his right of action against the defendant.\u00a0 The latter\u00a0 in turn, in answer to the plaintiff and for the purpose of denying his right of action, sets up the same charge of imitation, and supports his exception by offering in evidence the trade-mark that was imitated, substituted, and originally usurped; the right of a third person is not contested except as a defense against the plaintiff, and whatever is legitimate as a cause of action is equally legitimate as a defense.\u00a0 If the action is a legitimate one, although the usurped trade-mark was not entered or registered, legitimate must also be the defense, although the mark, usurped in turn by the complaining and injured party, may not have been recorded or registered.\u00a0 Therefore, there is no injury to him who in turn damages another by the same kind of injury, or no action for usurpation can be maintained by one who in turn appears as guilty of identical usurpation; evidence to this effect with respect to an act relating to a third person is not <i>res inter alios acta<\/i>, but a\u00a0 necessary proof of the defense of the defendant.\u00a0 And, inasmuch as the provision of the law must be complied with, it is needless in order to decide this case to consider the other exceptions or defenses of the defendant; the lack of right of action stands foremost owing to its conclusive effect.<br\/><br\/>By virtue of the foregoing and on account of the circumstances as set forth, the judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed with the costs of this instance against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa, Carson<\/i>, and <i>Willard, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><\/div>",

filed a petition with the Court of Land Registration for the registration in accordance with law of certain property of which he was the absolute owner, and which consisted of a parcel of land situated in Calle Alonso Velasquez, formerly Quesada, in the district of Tondo, city of Manila.\u00a0 The said land is bounded on the north by the lot owned by Martiniano Ponce; on the south by that of Emigdio Urrutia; on the east by Calle Alonso Velasquez; and on the west by the Bay of Manila.\u00a0 'The north and south sides each measure 26 meters and 82 centimeters, and the east and west boundaries 12 meters and 75 centimeters each, the whole area containing 341.955 square meters.\u00a0 At the last assessment, the said parcel of land was valued for the purposes of taxation at $275.50, United States currency, and was purchased by the petitioner from Mariano Inocencio.\u00a0 No incumbrance of any sort exists on the property, nor does any other person claim title or interest therein.\u00a0 Said land is occupied by Maria Consolacion de la Torre.\u00a0 Together with the petition for registration, there were presented a plan and technical description of the property, a certified copy of the instrument of sale made by Isaias de los Santos y Reyes to Mariano Inocencio y Norvera on the 12th of November, 1900, another instrument of sale with <i>pacto de retro<\/i> executed by Mariano Inocencio in favor of Leon Reyes on the 14th of January, 1907, another instrument of sale on reversion executed by the said Leon Reyes in favor of Mariano Inocencio on the 15th of January, 1908, and the bill of sale executed by Mariano Inocencio in favor of the applicant Tomas Inocencio and his wife Efigenia Ampil on the 14th of July, 1908.<br\/><br\/>From the report of the registrar of deeds, it appears that the land or lot described in the foregoing petition was segregated from a larger parcel situated on said Calle Quesada, and that the vendor, Isaias de los Santos y Reyes, inherited it from his late father, and that he was in possession when he commenced the possessory information proceedings in the Court of First Instance of the district of Tondo, approved on the 28th of August, 1900, and his right of possession without prejudice to a third party was recorded on the 13th of September of the same year.<br\/><br\/>After the foregoing petition was amended with respect to the names\u00a0 and post-office addresses of the tenants who now occupy the property in question, and after notices were served and published as provided by law, Miguel Gat-Pandan appeared on the 7th of October, 1908, on his own behalf and as attorney in fact for his sister Quiteria, and objected to the said application for registration made by Tomas Inocencid y Alejo for the land or lot above referred to, on the ground that said property was owned by him and his aforenamed sister, they having inherited it from their\u00a0 deceased grandfather, Pedro Bernardino.<br\/><br\/>Evidence was adduced by both parties and their exhibits made of record;\u00a0 at the trial the objector amended his opposition and stated that the land in question was inherited by them from their late mother, Maria Bernardino, who, in turn, had acquired it from her brother Pedro Bernardino.<br\/><br\/>After hearing the evidence adduced, judgment was entered by the court below on the 12th of November, 1908, holding that the evidence did not establish either the ownership of the petitioner nor that of the objectors of the land in question, and the opposition was overruled and the application dismissed.<br\/><br\/>The petitioner moved for a new trial on the ground that the decision of the court was contrary to the evidence.\u00a0 His motion was overruled, whereupon he excepted thereto and to the judgments,\u00a0 and against all the decisions rendered against him in the case, and gave notice of his intention to present a bill of exceptions.\u00a0 This\u00a0 latter, after being approved has been submitted to this court for review.<br\/><br\/>Later, on the 26th of December of the same year, the trial judge in an addition to his decision set forth further reasons for not considering the claims of the petitioner to be justified.<br\/><br\/>The title presented by Tomas Inocencio in applying to the Court of Land Registration for the registration of the lot is the one that was transferred to him by the vendor, Mariano Inocencio, who obtained it from Isaias de los Santos who in turn inherited it from his father Jose de los Santos.\u00a0 The latter is presumed to have been the original owner or possessor under title of ownership, of the lot in question.<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"The rights to the succession of a person are transmitted from the moment of his death.\"\u00a0 (Art. 657, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>\"Heirs succeed the deceased in all his rights and obligations by the mere fact of his death.\"\u00a0 (Art. 661, Civil Code.)<\/blockquote><br\/>According to article 807 of said code, heirs by force of law are, in the first place, the legitimate children and descendants, with regard to their legitimate parents and ascendants.<br\/><br\/>The record in the case shows that the said Jose de los Santos left four children, three boys and one girl, one of whom is Isaias de los Santos.\u00a0 If the said lot was actually the property of the aforesaid Jose de los Santos, upon his death these four children, who are his heirs by force of law should have succeeded him, they being, after his death, the sole owners of the lot in question.\u00a0 One of the heirs, Isaias de los Santos, could not lawfully dispose\u00a0 of it without the consent of his other coheirs and coowners.\u00a0 (Art. 348, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>Under section 19 of Act No. 496, application for registration of title may be made, among others, by the following persons: \"1. The person or persons claiming, singly or collectively, to own the legal estate in fee simple.\"<br\/><br\/>The applicant, Tomas Inocencio, claims to be the sole owner of the lot in question, having acquired it by purchase from Mariano Inocencio, who in turn acquired it from Isaias de los\u00a0 Santos; and as, according to the record, the latter was not the sole owner of the said lot, it not appearing that in order to lawfully dispose of the property he had previously obtained the consent of his coowners, or that the latter had transferred to him their rights thereto, there can be no question as to the fact that the applicant Tomas Inocencio can not call himself the absolute owner of the lot, or claim as such the registration of his title, inasmuch as Isaias de los Santos could not have transferred to Mariano Inocencio other rights than those which he himself possessed therein; nor could the latter have transferred to the said applicant any rights further than those transmitted to him by Isaias as coheir, with his three other brothers, of the late Jose de los Santos, as principal.<br\/><br\/>Hence, even on the hypothesis that the late Jose de los Santos was actually the original owner of the lot in question, the petitioner, Tomas Inocencio, as the last purchaser who acquired the same, does not hold title as owner in fee simple; therefore his title can not be registered under the provisions of the above-cited law.<br\/><br\/>As to the rest, we believe that the finding in the judgment appealed from, to the effect that the evidence in the case does not establish the ownership of the applicant, for the reason that the record does not show that Jose de los Santos was the owner of the land in question, or that he possessed it as owner during the time fixed by law, is in accordance with the law and the weight of the evidence, since it appears in the proceedings that the said lot was erroneously included in the possessory information proceedings instituted by Isaias de los Santos in connection with another and larger parcel of land; and that prior to the year 1896, Maria Bernardino possessed the said lot, which she in turn inherited from her brother Pedro, the former holder thereof.\u00a0 In spite of the fact that the trial court held that the ownership of the opponents who did not appeal from the decision had not been proven, yet the judgment appealed from must be sustained, and the petition for registration denied.<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing it is our opinion that the judgment appealed from should be affirmed as we do hereby affirm it with the costs against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Agayan replied that the knife of the cock had not been untied at his request but upon that of the owner; then the accused told Agayan, that he always behaved himself in that way, and at the same time he attacked the latter stabbing him with a penknife, and Agayan, in consequence of this attack, was wounded in his left foot.\"\u00a0 (Folio 13.) <\/blockquote> The only other witnesses for the prosecution were a municipal policeman, Diego Bayuga, who arrested and searched the\u00a0 accused, without finding a knife or other weapon in his possession, and who did not arrive upon the scene until after Agayan was wounded and Francisco Esposo, the president of the municipal board of health, who stated that he treated Agayan's wound, which was located below his left knee, and which was so severe that it required medical treatment for two months, more or less.<br\/><br\/>Vicente Agbayani, the accused, testified in his own behalf as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"I can state that the reason why Hilarion Agayan was injured in\u00a0 one of his feet is because he attempted to strike me on the day of the occurrence when I was speaking with Ruftno Ines in the street, at which time Hilarion Agayan, accompanied by Ciriaco Concepcion, came to the place where we were, and being asked by me as to the luck he had in the cockpit, he answered that, if it had not been due to my craziness he would probably have won; I told him that he should be moderate, that he was more crazy than I was, and for this reason he took out of his pocket a penknife with which he attempted to stab me, but I caught him by the arm and, while in this position, he kicked me with the toe of his shoe, and in order to avoid the attack I held him by both wrists, and restrained him by putting down his arms each time he tried to kick me; in this manner he was wounded in the foot as he held the knife in his right hand.\" (Folios 16 and 17 of the record.)\u00a0 Rufino Ines, a witness for the defense, made the following statement:<br\/><br\/>\"One Sunday evening in the month of March, while I was converging with the accused in the main street of Sinait, Ilocos Sur, Hilarion Agayan, accompanied by Conception, came up to where we were standing and the accused having asked Agayan what luck he had at the cockpit, the latter replied that if it were not due to his being crazy, he would have won; the accused, after hearing this, answered by telling Agayan not to treat him in that manner, and as the latter continued to call him crazy, the accused told him that he was still more crazy, whereupon Agayan took out of his pocket a penknife which he opened, and, in making an attempt to stab the accused, the latter caught Agayan by both hands and while in this position, as Agayan kicked the accused, the latter moved backward each time, putting down Agayan's hands, and after the accused was kicked three times Agayan said that he was wounded.\"\u00a0 (Folio 20 of the record.)<\/blockquote><br\/>Manuel Palpal-latoc, another witness for the defense, testified as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"That the accused and Agayan fought because the latter stabbed the former with a penknife and then the accused suddenly caught Agayan by both arms and while in this position Agayan told the accused to\u00a0 release his arms, but the accused replied that he was not willing to do so, so that Agayan kicked the accused three times, as I could see, and at the third kick Agayan said that his foot was wounded, whereupon they parted and then policemen arrived.\"\u00a0 (Folio 23 of the record.)<br\/><\/blockquote>The various witnesses were examined and cross-examined at some length, but no testimony of value appears in the record other than that set out above, except the statement by the accused, that the complaining witness and Ciriaco Concepcion arrived together on\u00a0 the scene of the quarrel,<br\/><blockquote>\"Agbayani holding the arm of Concepcion\u00a0 who was intoxicated.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Giving the accused the benefit of the presumption of innocence in his favor, we do not think that the evidence of record establishes his guilt of the crime of which he was convicted.\u00a0 The story of the affair as told by the witnesses for the prosecution does not appear to be a full and frank statement of all that occurred, for, if, as they allege, the complaining witness and the accused were quietly standing face to face when the accused suddenly and without warning stabbed his opponent, it is, to say the least, very improbable that the wound would have been inflicted in the leg below the knee.\u00a0 The testimony of the accused and his witness rings true, and explains very satisfactorily the manner in which the wound was inflicted, and accounts for the fact that but a single wound was inflicted, and this wound in the leg of his opponent.<br\/><br\/>Accepting the testimony of the witnesses for the defense as true, it is quite clear that whatever part the accused had in inflicting the wound upon the complaining witness, he was acting in legitimate self-defense which, under the provisions of subsection 4 of article 8, of the Penal Code, wholly exempts him from criminal responsibility therefor.\u00a0 As required by the provisions\u00a0 of that article, what he did was done in repelling \"unlawful aggression,\" there was \"reasonable necessity for the means employed\" by him, and he had given his adversary \"no sufficient provocation\" for the attack made upon him.<br\/><br\/>It has been suggested that the accused might have avoided the conflict by taking to flight, but, as was said in the case of The United States <i>vs.<\/i> Mack (8 Phil. Rep., 701), \"one who is unlawfully assaulted need not attempt to retreat where there is no reasonable ground to believe that by so doing he can safely avoid the threatened attack.\"\u00a0 It can not be said that flight always affords a safe means of escape from an attack at close quarters with an open knife, and in the case at bar, we think that the accused adopted a reasonable and natural means of defending himself when he seized his assailant by the arms and attempted to hold him so that he could do no mischief.<br\/><br\/>The judgment and sentence of the trial court are reversed with the costs of both instances <i>de oficio<\/i>, and the accused is acquitted of the crime with which he was charged, and will be set at liberty forthwith.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">On the 25th day\u00a0 of June, 1906, the plaintiff commenced an action entitled \"Jose Cardell, plaintiff, <i>vs.<\/i> Ramon Ma\u00f1eru et al.\" in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, which action was based upon the failure on the part of the defendants to comply with a certain contract of rent for the use and occupation of a certain house for a period of three years, which contract of rent began Lo run from\u00a0 the 1st day of September, 1901.\u00a0 The plaintiff alleged that the said contract was entered into between the plaintiff and the said Ramon Ma\u00f1eru, as the legal representative of <i>una sociedad colectiva bajo la razon social de \"Ayesa y Compa\u00f1ia,\" propietaria de la fdbrica de tabacos denominada \"El Aguila Real.\"<\/i><br\/><br\/>A reading of the said contract of rent (Exhibit B) shows that the same was executed by the said Ramon Ma\u00f1eru, as the legal representative of said <i>sociedad<\/i>, in favor of the plaintiff.\u00a0 By the terms of the contract, the real defendart (Ayesa y Compa\u00f1ia) obligated itself to pay to the plaintiff as rent for the use of said house, the sum of P500 per month, payable in advance within the first five days of each month, and also the taxes upon the said rented\u00a0 property, as well as the water and the electricity used in said property.\u00a0 The defendant was also obligated by the terms of said contract to conserve the rented property in good condition during the period of the contract.\u00a0 The\u00a0 plaintiff alleged that the defendant (Ayesa y Compa\u00f1ia) occupied the property in question until the 31st day of January, 1906, when it moved out of the property and left the same unoccupied, and thereafter failed to pay the rent under the terms of the contract, as well as the taxes and the water.<br\/><br\/>The defendants, Alejandro and Eusebio Sanchez and Isidro Bilbao, were served with a copy of the complaint and were required to answer the same, which they did on the 21st of August, 1906.\u00a0 Later the attorneys for these said defendants made a motion for permission to withdraw the defense which they had interposed against the complaint, which motion, upon due hearing, was granted\u00a0 by the lower court on the 6th day of October, 1906.<br\/><br\/>On the 10th day of September, 1906, Ramon Ma\u00f1eru duly filed his answer to the said complaint, presenting a general and a specific denial.<br\/><br\/>On the 21st day of August, 1906, the defendant, Luis Beliso, presented his answer to the complaint, admitting some of the facts alleged by the plaintiff, but denying that <i>La Sociedad de Ayesa y Compa\u00f1ia<\/i> was the owner of the <i>fabrica de tabacos denominada \"El Aguila Real.\"<\/i> and for a special defense alleged the following facts:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"(<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">a<\/span>) That the partnership Ayesa and Company was dissolved on or about the 26th of July, 1904, and the partnership Maneru y Beliso then and there established for the purpose of operating the cigar factory '<i>El Aguila Real<\/i>.'<br\/><br\/>\"(<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">b<\/span>) That subsequently, that is to say, on or about the 31st day\u00a0 of January, 1905, the said partnership Ma\u00f1eru y Beliso was reorganized and converted by Ramon Ma\u00f1eru and the defendant herein, the only parties in interest in the concern, into a joint stock company called '<i>El Aguila Real<\/i>' which likewise engaged in operating the cigar factory of the same name.<br\/><br\/>\"(<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">c<\/span>) That on or about the 1st day of January, 1906, the said defendant Luis Beliso sold his interest or share in the aforesaid cigar factory '<i>El Aguila Real<\/i>' to Isidoro Bilbao and Eusebio Sanchez, who are also made defendants in this case, and who took over the rights and obligations that belonged or might pertain to the respondent in the said company.<br\/><br\/>\"(<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">d<\/span>) That the plaintiff knows and is fully informed of the fact that the partnership Ayesa and Company had ceased to exist, having latterly and finally been converted into a joint stock company called '<i>El Aguila Real<\/i>.'<br\/><br\/>\"(<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">e<\/span>) That the original rent of the building in question was, by mutual consent of the parties, reduced to the sum of four hundred\u00a0 (P400) pesos per month.<br\/><br\/>\"(<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">f<\/span>) That the above-mentioned building is yielding at the present time more than it did when occupied by the said cigar factory.<br\/><br\/>\"In view of all the foregoing the defendant prays the court to enter judgment in his favor, absolving him of the complaint with the costs against the plaintiff.\u00a0 He likewise prays for any other just and equitable remedy in the premises.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>On the 13th day of July, 1906, the defendant Benjamin Ayesa presented his answer in the words following:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"That he has no interest in the object of the complaint mentioned.<br\/><br\/>\"By virtue thereof he prays the court to order that he be excluded therefrom as a defendant.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>After hearing the evidence adduced during the trial, the lower court rendered a judgment against the defendant, Ramon Ma\u00f1eru, Benjamin Ayesa and Luis Beliso, and each of them, for the sum of P1,371.71, with interest thereon at the rate of 6 per cent per annum since the 30th day of June, 1906, and for the costs of this action.<br\/><br\/>From\u00a0 this judgment of the lower court the defendant, Luis Beliso, appealed to this court and made the following assignments of error:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"(1)\u00a0 The court below erred in holding that Ayesa and Company occupied the house, subject to the lease, until the 31st of January, 1906.<br\/><br\/>\"(2)\u00a0 The court below erred in holding that the rental for the month of January had\u00a0 not been paid.<br\/><br\/>\"(3)\u00a0 The court below erred in holding that there was not sufficient evidence to infer that the persons who form the joint stock company '<i>El Aguila Real<\/i>' were bound to the plaintiff by virtue of the said lease contract.<br\/><br\/>\"(4)\u00a0 The court below\u00a0 erred when inferring\u00a0 that Luis Beliso was still bound to the plaintiff for the supposed violation of the said lease contract.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>In the first assignment of error above noted the appellant alleges that the court committed an error in holding that the defendant, <i>Ayesa y Compa\u00f1ia<\/i>, occupied the house in question until the 31st day of January, 1906.\u00a0 The appellant, Luis Beliso, evidently bases this assignment of error upon the ground that <i>Ayesa y Compa\u00f1ia<\/i> was dissolved on the 2d day of November, 1904, and thereafter ceased to exist.\u00a0 The facts seem to be as follows:<br\/><br\/>(1) On or about the 26th day of June, 1904, Benjamin Ayesa,\u00a0 Luis\u00a0 Beliso, and Ramon Ma\u00f1eru organized <i>una sociedad mercantil regular colectiva bajo la razon social de \"Ayesa y Compa\u00f1ia\"<\/i> for the manufacture and sale of tobacco and cigars (Exhibit A), <i>por medio de la fabrica titulada \"El Aguila Real\"<\/i> Each of the members of this company contributed to the capital stock the sum of P5,000.<br\/><br\/>(2) On the 10th day of August, 1904, Ramon Ma\u00f1eru, as the representative of said company, entered into a contract (Exhibit B) for and on behalf of said company, for the rent of a certain house situated at No. 4 Calle de Gunao in the district of Quiapo, city of Manila, for the purpose of carrying on the business for which the company was organized.<br\/><br\/>(3) On the 2d day of November, 1904, by mutual agreement of the partners, <i>La Sociedad de Ayesa y Compa\u00f1ia<\/i> was dissolved (Exhibit D) (13).<br\/><br\/>(4) On the 2d day of November, 1904, Luis Beliso and Ramon Ma\u00f1eru, having acquired <i>la fabrica de tabacos y cigarrillos titulada \"El Aguila Real,<\/i>\" organized <i>una sociedad mercantil bajo la razon social de \"Ma\u00f1eru y Beliso\"<\/i> (Exhibit D) (14).<br\/><br\/>(5) On the 13th day of January, 1905, La Compa\u00f1ia de Ma\u00f1eru y Beliso was mutually dissolved by agreement of its members (Exhibit D) (20).<br\/><br\/>(6) On the 13th day of January, 1905, Ramon Ma\u00f1eru and Luis Beliso organized <i>una sociedad mercantil anonima bajo la denominacion \"El Aguila Real\"<\/i> (Exhibit D) (12).<br\/><br\/>(7) <i>La Sociedad de Ma\u00f1eru y Beliso<\/i> established its business at No. 4 Calle de Gunao in the district of Quiapo, city of Manila.\u00a0 (See paragraph No. 1, Exhibit D) (14).<br\/><br\/>(8) <i>La Sociedad Anonima \"El Aguila Real\"<\/i> was established at No. 4 Calle de Gunao, in the district of Quiapo, city of Manila.\u00a0 (See paragraph No. 4, Exhibit D) (12).<br\/><br\/>By reference to paragraphs 7 and 8 above, it will be seen that <i>La Sociedad de Ma\u00f1eru y Beliso<\/i> and <i>La Sociedad Anonima \"El Aguila Real\"<\/i> continued to occupy the house which was rented by <i>La Sociedad de Ayesa y Compa\u00f1ia<\/i>, situated at No. 4 Calle de Gunao.\u00a0 There is nothing in the record which shows by what authority or under what terms the last two-named societies continued to occupy the said house, which the defendant herein, <i>Ayesa y Compa\u00f1ia<\/i>, had rented from the plaintiff.\u00a0 There is nothing in the record which shows or tends to show that upon the dissolution of <i>La Sociedad de Ayesa y Compa\u00f1ia<\/i>, any notice whatever was given to the plaintiff.\u00a0 There is nothing in the record which shows or tends to show that the plaintiff herein had ever been released from the terms of the said contract of rent.<br\/><br\/>The mere\u00a0 dissolution of <i>La Sociedad de Ayesa y Compa\u00f1ia<\/i> by the mutual consent of its members, would not release said company from its contractual obligations entered into before such dissolution, at least until after due notice of such dissolution had been recorded in the mercantile registry.\u00a0 (Art. 226, Commercial Code.)<br\/><br\/>There is nothing in the record which shows that the dissolution of <i>Ayesa y Compa\u00f1ia<\/i> had ever been recorded in the commercial registry; neither is there anything in the record which shows that said company had been released from its liability, under the contract of rent, upon which the present action is based, prior to the 31st day of January, 1906, the time when the said house was vacated.<br\/><br\/>The evident theory of the appellant is that because of the fact that <i>Ayesa y Compa\u00f1ia<\/i> was dissolved in November, 1904, and that the other two societies continued to occupy the house in question thereafter up to the 31st day of January, 1906, that <i>Ayesa y Compa\u00f1ia<\/i> was dissolved from all liability for the payment of the rent.\u00a0 This theory is not tenable, in the absence of proof that the plaintiff had accepted another tenant in lieu of the said company, or had expressly released said company from its liability.\u00a0 There is no proof that the plaintiff had done either.\u00a0 On conclusion is, therefore, that <i>Ayesa y Compa\u00f1ia<\/i> continued to be responsible for the payment of the rent under the terms of this contract (Exhibit B) for the full term of said contract, or until the time when it was expressly released from liability by the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>The house was vacated on the 31st day of January, 1906.\u00a0 Due notice of such, disoccupation was given to the plaintiff thirty days prior thereto.\u00a0 The plaintiff made no objection to the disoccupation, and soon thereafter rented a portion if not all of said property to other persons.\u00a0 If the plaintiff desired to insist upon the fulfillment of his contract with <i>Ayesa y Compa\u00f1ia<\/i>, he should have insisted upon its fulfillment at the time of the disoccupation, and should not have given his consent to the disoccupation of the property in question.\u00a0 The voluntary consent of the\u00a0 plaintiff to the disoccupation of the property, without insisting upon a compliance with the terms of the contract of rent was equivalent to giving his consent to the termination of the contract of rent and to a relinquishment of any further rights which he had under said contract.<br\/><br\/>Our conclusion then upon the first assignment of error above noted\u00a0 is that <i>La Sociedad de Ayesa y Compa\u00f1i<\/i>a was responsible for the payment of the rent of the house in question up to and including the 31st day of January, 1906.<br\/><br\/>From the record it appears that by reason of certain representations made by <i>Ayesa y Compa\u00f1ia<\/i> to the plaintiff, the plaintiff agreed to reduce the price of the rent from P500 to P400 per month until the business of the said company should be improved.\u00a0 This reduction was made for the months of September, October, November, and December, 1905.\u00a0 There is nothing in the record which shows that the business conditions of the company ever improved.\u00a0 The conditions upon which the reduction was made, therefore, and upon which the defendant promised to pay the full amount of rent are not shown to have existed.\u00a0 The plaintiff,' therefore, can not, under the conditions of the record, insist upon the payment of the difference between the regular amount of rent stipulated in the contract and that which was actually received by him.<br\/><br\/>The appellant insists that the court committed an error in deciding that the rent for the month of January, 1906, had not been paid.\u00a0 With reference to this assignment of error, we are of the opinion and so hold that the defendant had paid the rent for the month of January, 1906.\u00a0 (See testimony of Felix Fanlo and the stub of receipt No. 20 of Exhibit!) (16).<br\/><br\/>Under the third assignment of error, the appellant undertakes to show that <i>La Sociedad Anonima \"El Aguila Real\"<\/i> was responsible for the payment of the rent under said contract of rent (Exhibit B) and asserts that by reason of the fact that the plaintiff had received the rent from said <i>sociedad anonima<\/i> for several months, that he had thereby accepted said <i>sociedad<\/i> as his tenant, and had there by released the defendant herein from any further responsibility under the said contract of rent.\u00a0 The evidence shows that the rent was collected by the agent of the plaintiff.\u00a0 The record does not show that the plaintiff's attention had ever been called to the fact that the property in question was occupied by anyone other than the defendant herein. The defendant, <i>Ayesa y Compa\u00f1ia<\/i>, so far as the record discloses, never attempted to be released from the terms of its original contract up to and including the 31st day of January, 1906, and the mere dissolution of said company, as was said above,\u00a0 could not have the effect of absolving it from its contractual obligations.\u00a0 There is nothing\u00a0 in the record which justifies a finding that <i>La Sociedad Anonima \"El Aguila Real\"<\/i> had assumed the obligations of said contract of rent or had in way been substituted as a tenant of said house, by or with the consent of the plaintiff, for<i> Ayesa y Compa\u00f1ia<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>The appellant insists in his fourth assignment of error that the lower court committed an error in rendering a judgment against him\u00a0 for the supposed violation of said contract of rent.\u00a0 The appellant, Luis Beliso, was a member of <i>La Sociedad de Ayesa y Compa\u00f1ia<\/i>.\u00a0 This fact is not disputed.\u00a0 He is, therefore, responsible for the payment of the obligations of said company arising under the said contract of rent.\u00a0 (See art. 127, Code of Commerce; decision of the supreme court of Spain of the 17th of December, 1873; and the decision of the supreme court of Spain of January 8, 1881.)<br\/><br\/>Our conclusions, therefore, upon all of the facts of the record and the assignments of error presented by the appellant are as follows:<br\/><br\/>First.\u00a0 That <i>Ayesa y Compa\u00f1ia<\/i> was responsible for the payment of-<br\/><br\/>(a) The rent of the house in question, the taxes and the water, under the terms of the contract of rent up to and including the 31st day of January, 1906;<br\/><br\/>(b) That the rent was paid up to and including the 31st day of January, 1906;<br\/><br\/>(c) That the taxes and water had not been paid for the month of January, 1906;<br\/><br\/>(d) That the taxes for the month of January, 1906, amounted to P62.32;<br\/><br\/>(e) That the tax for the water used in said house for the month of January, 1906, amounted to P19.04.<br\/><br\/>Under this conclusion, therefore, the defendant is liable to pay to the plaintiff the sum of P81.36.\u00a0 It is, therefore, hereby ordered that the judgment of the lower court be modified in accordance with the above finding of facts and without any special finding as to costs, it is so ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

First, of a sworn retraction by the principal witness for the prosecution, Juliana Gutierrez, of her testimony given at the trial, which she now states, under oath, was false in every essential particular, and given at the trial under the inspiration of Captain Crame, a police officer, who forced her to testify as she did by the use of threats and violence;

third, of evidence tending to disclose that the deceased had an engagement with a certain woman of ill-repute on the night when he came to his death, and that had he undertaken to keep this engagement, he would not and could not have been in the place where the prosecution alleges, and the findings of the trial court declare he was, when he was murdered; and fourth, of evidence as to conditions existing in and around the place where the dead body was found, and of the absence of blood in the yard of the house of the defendant Arcangel, which in the opinion of counsel for the appellants sustains their contention in the court below that the deceased could not have been done to death in the house of Arcangel, and the dead body after-wards carried to the place where it was found, as alleged by the witnesses for the prosecution and set out in the findings of fact by the trial court.<br\/><br\/>The Solicitor-General opposed the motion for a new trial on the ground that only one of the affidavits upon which it is based discloses the existence of <i>newly discovered evidence<\/i> which could not have been discovered and submitted in the court below by the exercise of due diligence on the part of the appellants and their counsel; and because the alleged newly discovered evidence is not evidence which if it were submitted on a new trial would necessarily, or even probably change the result arrived at in the original proceedings.<br\/><br\/>We are satisfied that no amount of diligence on the part of the appellants, or their counsel, could have secured the retraction of the testimony of Juliana Gutierrez in time to take advantage thereof in the court below; and, while it is true that most if not all of the other affidavits set out alleged facts which, if true, might perhaps have been developed during\u00a0 the trial by the exercise of due diligence, we would not be disposed to apply, in all their rigor, the, technical rules touching the granting of new trials on the ground of newly discovered evidence, in a case involving the imposition of the death penalty, if in our opinion, the evidence submitted were such that if introduced upon a new trial it would probably and properly result in an acquittal.\u00a0 As we understand it the granting or denial of a motion for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence lies in the sound judicial discretion of the court to which it is directed to be determined as the interests of justice may demand, when the movements have brought themselves within the well-known rules governing the submission of such motions; but the state being not less, interested than the individual accused of a crime in his acquittal if he is innocent, these rules should be construed and applied with marked liberality in cases, such as that under consideration, wherein the life of an accused person is at stake.<br\/><br\/>We have, therefore, directed our attention to the contents of the affidavits submitted in support of the motion, more especially with a view to determine whether a different result would and should be arrived at, if on a new trial, in accordance with the practice heretofore adopted by this court, the record were returned to the court below with instructions to reopen the different cases against the appellants, and take the evidence of all the affiants in support of the motion for a new trial, and such other and additional evidence as the reopening of these cases might render proper and necessary.<br\/><br\/>Without attempting to enter upon an exhaustive comparative analysis and review of the voluminous record brought here on appeal, examined together with the alleged facts developed by the affidavits submitted by the movents, we might summarize our conclusions as to the probative value of the facts alleged by the various affiants, other than Juliana Gutierrez, by saying that, assuming that the record before us contained the testimony of these witnesses to the precise facts set out in their affidavits, such evidence could not and should not change or modify our conclusions as to the guilt of the appellants.<br\/><br\/>The mere fact, if it be a fact, that the policeman Delgado had an engagement to meet a woman of ill repute after going off duty on the night on which he was murdered, is in itself of small probative value, if indeed it can be said to have any value whatever, in rebuttal of direct evidence to the fact\u00a0 that immediately after being relieved, he went into a house just off his beat, to talk with and to be entertained by Juliana Gutierrez, or perhaps merely to rest for a little while after the labors of the day\u2014and it is chiefly, if not solely\u00a0 for this purpose, that the affidavits touching this alleged engagement are submitted.<br\/><br\/>So the negative testimony contained in the statements of the affiants who say that on the morning after the murder they did not observe any traces of blood in the yard of Arcangel through which the trial judge held that the dead body of the policeman was carried to the place where it was found, has but little weight in rebuttal of the testimony of an eyewitness to the incident, substantially corroborated as it is as to one, at least, of the defendants by his extra-judicial confession and admissions, and indirectly corroborated as to all by the testimony of the witnesses who testified affirmatively to the discovery of unexplained traces of blood on the floor of the room in the house of the defendant Arcangel where the trial judge found the murderous attack was made, and on the stairs and path leading therefrom in\u00a0 the direction of the place where the body was found; and this, more especially, because at the time when they allege they were at the scene of the crime on the morning after it was committed, none of them had any reason to suspect that the deceased had not been done to death where he lay, so that the fact that they did not observe traces of blood along the route over which later developments tended to disclose that the dead body had been carried, is in nowise remarkable.<br\/><br\/>For similar reasons the opinion of the affiant McGraw that the crime was committed at or near the place where the body was found,\u00a0 which appears in his affidavit dated more than a year after the crime was committed, is of but little value.\u00a0 It was based on observations made by him on the morning after the crime was committed, at the place where the body was found, to which he appears to have been attracted by the mere idle curiosity of a passerby.\u00a0 He had at that time no reason to believe that the policeman had not been killed while on duty on his beat, and under the circumstances it is not to be supposed that he made a very careful investigation for the purpose of determining whether this was true or not.\u00a0 In support of his opinion he says, first, that he saw no traces of blood leading away from the scene of the crime; second, that when the body was moved the flow of coagulated blood from the wounds in the throat indicated that before that time there had been no great exterior loss of blood from these wounds, from which affiant inferred that the body had not been moved after the death wounds had been inflicted; and, finally, he says that he noticed that the grass was trampled down at a point very near the place where the body lay, in such a way that affiant came to the conclusion that the deceased and his aggressors had had a struggle there.<br\/><br\/>We have already stated that in our opinion, negative testimony as to the presence of a trail of blood leading to the place where the body was found, submitted by witnesses who made their observations at a time when they had no reason to suspect that the deceased did not come to his death at the place where his body was found, is of but little probative value; and it is worthy of observation that if this affiant's inexpert and unscientific opinion that the deceased had not suffered a heavy exterior loss of blood before he was abandoned at the place where his body was found is correct, this fact would in itself partially account for the failure of the different affiants to notice a trail of blood leading to the house of Arcangel, where the crime was committed.<br\/><br\/>As to the trampled-down grass, it is to be remembered that from his own statement it appears that affiant was not the first person on the scene of the crime, and that the evidence discloses that a number of persons had preceded him in examining the body where it lay, so that the condition of the grass which he undertakes to recall and describe in his affidavit, may well have been the result of the presence of these onlookers, or it may have been caused by those who carried the dead body of the deceased as they stood for a moment preparatory to laying or throwing it on the ground.\u00a0 And whatever be the correct explanation of the alleged facts set out in the statement of this affiant, as distinguished from his opinion which was formed originally under conditions which render it improbable that such opinion could afford a safe guide even were it admissible as evidence, we do not think that these facts are necessarily in conflict with the material facts developed by the witnesses for the prosecution at the trial.<br\/><br\/>The statement of Juliana Gutierrez that she saw the defendant Pablo Raymundo being maltreated by a police officer for the purpose of compelling him to make the confession of his guilt which was offered in evidence at the trial is\u00a0 entitled to but scant consideration in ruling upon this motion for a new trial.\u00a0 If her testimony at the trial was true, nothing contained in her affidavit is worthy of credence; and if, as she alleges, all her evidence at the trial was false, no new fact set out in her affidavit can be taken as proven upon the testimony of such a witness.\u00a0 The fact alleged in the particular statement under consideration was contradicted and denied by the various witnesses who were present when Raymundo's confession and admissions were taken, and the trial court after hearing these witnesses testify and upon mature consideration of the testimony of Raymundo himself, held that they were made \"voluntarily and without compulsion or inducement;\", and in our opinion this finding is fully sustained by the evidence of record.\u00a0 We are not unaware of the possibility and even probability that an overzealous police officer may at times succumb to the temptation to use undue methods in extorting confessions and admissions from persons suspected of the commission of grave offenses, and we are fully alive to the necessity for the most painstaking scrutiny in weighing evidence relating to alleged voluntary confessions made to police officers; but the evidence as to the voluntary character of the confessions and admissions made by this defendant is so conclusive that it can not be put in doubt by an affidavit such as that\u00a0 submitted by Juliana Gutierrez, and indeed the detailed and specific character of the\u00a0 confession and admissions under consideration tends strongly to negative the suggestion that they were extorted by the use of physical violence, and it is hardly credible that such a confession of such a crime could be extorted involuntarily from an accused person by the use of such methods as\u00a0 those described by this affiant.\u00a0 For reasons indicated at the outset of this opinion, and in view of what has just been said, we do not deem it necessary to dwell on the cumulative quality of the alleged newly discovered evidence set out in this particular\u00a0 statement of the witness Juliana Gutierrez\u2014which under a strict application of the rules governing the granting of new trials, would, perhaps, in itself afford a sufficient ground for refusing to take her statement in this regard into consideration upon this motion.<br\/><br\/>But the sworn retraction by this affiant of all her material testimony given at the trial presents a more serious question, which must be examined and decided from a wholly different standpoint from that adopted in dealing with the statements contained in the affidavits already considered; since if her retraction be accepted as genuine and true, it discloses the existence of newly discovered evidence which would justify and require the reopening of the cases now on appeal, and in all human\u00a0 probability the acquittal of one of the appellants upon whom the court below imposed a long term of imprisonment, and perhaps the acquittal of the two appellants upon whom capital sentences were imposed.<br\/><br\/>This affiant, Juliana Gutierrez, was the principal witness for the prosecution, and the only eyewitness of the commission of the crime of which appellants were convicted.\u00a0 When first examined by the police, a few days after the crime had been committed, she denied all knowledge of its commission, but upon further examination at the police station and upon learning that the defendants had been arrested, she broke down, and told the whole stery of the crime, substantially as she afterwards told it on the witness stand.\u00a0 Later, on the preliminary investigation held by the prosecuting attorney of the city of Manila, she told, under oath, substantially the same story, except that on that occasion she said that the crime was committed on the road in front of and not inside the defendant Arcangel's house, and that Arcangel took no direct part in the commission of the crime.\u00a0 And, now, she declares, under oath, that the whole story was false; and her affidavit, if it could be believed, would tend very strongly to prove that none of the defendants had any part in the commission of the crime.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for movents, with no small show of reason, urge that the judgment of the court below, based as it is, in large part, on the\u00a0 testimony of this witness, should not be affirmed; and that the records of the various cases against the appellants should be returned to the Court of First Instance, and new trials granted.\u00a0 After a careful review of the whole record, however, we are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the statements made in affiant's retraction are false; that her testimony given in the Court of First Instance was true; and that appellants were properly and justly, convicted upon that testimony, taken together with the other evidence in the record.<br\/><br\/>At the time when the crime was committed this witness was an ignorant servant girl some 16 years of age.\u00a0 Due to the fact that the defendants were each given a separate trial, she was compelled to tell her story over and over again in open court, on not less than four separate occasions.\u00a0 On each occasion she was subjected to a searching cross-examination by different counsel for the various defendants, some of whom were of her own race and some American.\u00a0 After having told her story on the witness stand, she was taken to the scene of the crime to which the court adjourned, and there again examined and reexamined.\u00a0 In the very nature of the story she told, it could not be developed and was not developed by categorical answers to specific questions, and necessitated the relation by her of a long.series of closely connected incidents, so that her testimony in the record occupies nearly one hundred pages of typewritten matter.\u00a0 Throughout the entire proceedings, the trial judge was fully cognizant of the fact that upon the testimony of this witness depended, or appeared to depend the lives of one or more of the accused.\u00a0 He also knew that her story as told at the trial was not altogether in accord with that told\u00a0 at the preliminary investigation; indeed she admitted that fact when she first went on the witness stand, and explained that she had attempted in her statements made before the trial to shield Arcangel, in whose house she lived, and who had threatened to kill her or have her killed if she implicated him.\u00a0 And, yet, the learned and experienced judge who saw and heard her testify, with such exceptional opportunities to form a just estimate of her qualifications and credibility as a witness, was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the truth of the story told by her on the witness stand.<br\/><br\/>In his decision, the trial judge says that he found no substantial contradictions, in the dramatic account of the incidents of the night in question as related by her, and that he was satisfied that her story was in nowise shaken by the severe cross examinations to which she was subjected; and our examination of the whole record fully sustains his conclusions in this regard, for a careful review of all her testimony given at the various trials in the court below discloses no discrepancies or\u00a0 inconsistencies which tend in the slightest degree to weaken our faith in the genuineness and sincerity of the story told by her on the witness stand.\u00a0 Under all the circumstances, we can not and do not believe that if her account of the crime were false in every material detail as she now alleges, and if her story had been prepared for her as she now pretends, she could have withstood such a series of examinations and cross-examinations without involving herself in some fatal contradiction, and without betraying herself at some time or other to the trained eyes of the judge before whom she testified.\u00a0 Such a feat would be remarkable on the part of a man of mature mind, with large experience in the proceedings in American courts of justice; it is a well-nigh impossible one on the part of an ignorant servant girl but 16 or 17 years of age.<br\/><br\/>Moreover, as stated in our decision on the merits, her story was corroborated in a number of important details by other evidence of record, and what is not less worthy of observation, it was not successfully contradicted or put in doubt by anything which developed at the trial, either in the testimony of the other witnesses, or by the admitted facts of the case as they appear in the record or as they were disclosed on the view of the scene of the crime by the trial judge; and the extrajudicial confessions and admissions of Raymundo and Arcangel fully and conclusively corroborated every essential detail of the account of the commission of the crime as related by her, and give the lie to her retraction of her testimony submitted with this motion.<br\/><br\/>Furthermore, an examination of the circumstances under which her various statements were made, and of the alleged motives which actuated her in making them, tends strongly to confirm our belief in the truth of her testimony given at the trial and the falsity of her retraction set out in her affidavit.\u00a0 By her affidavit, she would now have us believe that a police officer, Captain Crame,\u00a0 in his anxiety to secure the conviction of the defendants, induced or rather forced her to testify as she did, by speaking harshly to her, and by the use of violence and maltreatment which she states went to the extent of slapping her on the cheek or side of her head with his hand.\u00a0 It appears thai from the time when she had this alleged interview with Captain Crame until after the trial, she lived in one of the convents of this city, and that during that time she was brought before the prosecuting attorney of the city in the course of the preliminary investigation held by that officer.\u00a0 Ignorant, as she undoubtedly was, it is difficult to believe that her interview with the police officer and the alleged violence of his behavior on that occasion could have so dominated and controlled her will that neither in the seclusion of the convent, nor in the prosecuting attorney's office, nor in the trial court does she appear to have made any complaint, nor told anyone what had happened, although she must have known that her testimony given at the trial would in all probability result in bringing to the gallows her friend and relative in whose house she had lived, and perhaps her three other personal friends one or two of whom were her admirers or lovers.\u00a0 On the other hand her statement at the trial that the accused or their friends had threatened to kill her if she testified against them, which she made in explanation of the fact that she had asked to be committed for her own personal security to a convent, explains satisfactorily her original reticence and hesitation in giving information against the accused, and also suggests an explanation of her extraordinary conduct in submitting the affidavit retracting her testimony given at the trial.\u00a0 Two other witnesses in the court below, who testified to the presence of some of the accused near the scene of the crime at about the time it was committed, swore that they had been threatened with sudden death if they told what they knew, and we see no reason to doubt the statement of Juliana Gutierrez on the witness stand that she also was threatened in like manner; and keeping that fact in mind, and also keeping in mind the fact that all the accused were her former friends and associates, we are strongly convinced that the trial being ended and this poor ignorant woman having apparently passed out of the protection and guardian care of the court, she was led to make her retraction of her testimony at the trial by the exercise of some such undue influences as were undoubtedly at work in an unsuccessful effort to prevent the introduction of damaging evidence against these appellants at the trial.<br\/><br\/>In conclusion, we may add, that even if it were admitted that this affiant's retraction were sufficient to cast a doubt upon the truth of her testimony in the court below, any testimony which she might give on the reopening of the trial in the court below would be equally unworthy of belief.\u00a0 If her testimony given at the former trial is unworthy of credence, no new testimony which she might give on a new trial would merit the slightest consideration.\u00a0 The result would necessarily be that the trial judge would be compelled to decide the case on the record substantially as it stands, striking out therefrom all the testimony of this witness; and in our opinion the evidence left in the record, while it would not be sufficient to sustain the conviction of the appellant Gutierrez (who was sentenced to imprisonment), would be wholly sufficient to sustain the conviction of the appellants Raymundo and Arcangel, upon whom death sentences were imposed, their\u00a0 extrajudicial confessions and admissions establishing their guilt as found by the trial court beyond a reasonable doubt.<br\/><br\/>And it may be well to add further, that in seeking to ascertain the truth or falsity of the statements contained in the retraction of\u00a0 her testimony in the court below by the affiant, Juliana Gutierrez, we have not limited ourselves to a review of the record in\u00a0 any one of the separate trials in the court\u00a0 below, partly because the motion for a new trial together with this affidavit was submitted jointly in behalf of all the appellants, but chiefly because this motion being directed to the sound discretion of the court, the question of the truth or falsity of this affiant's retraction justifies and requires a review of the whole record before us, the fact that separate trials were granted in the court below in nowise limiting the breadth of the inquiry.<br\/><br\/>Convinced as we are of the falsity of the statements contained in the retraction of her testimony by this affiant, and of the immateriality of the evidence set out in the statements of the other affiants, it is clearly our duty to deny the motion under consideration and it is so ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

that, shortly afterward the deceased himself came in and after a brief conversation, stating that he was tired, lay down on the floor, with his head toward a window facing the road, and his feet toward the door; that very soon after, three of the accused, Gutierrez, Leyva and Raymundo, entered the house, the first placing his knee on the stomach of the deceased, the second seizing his left arm, and the third his right; that Raymundo stabbed the deceased in the neck with a sharp pointed instrument which he had in his possession, and that Arcangel then came in from outside, took two bolos from the side of the house and stabbed the deceased in the neck, giving the other bolo to Gutierrez, who stabbed the deceased in the abdomen; that the deceased soon expired and that all four' carried him out of the house and laid him first under a tree in the yard and waited while Gutierrez went out to the road to see if the coast was clear, and finding it so, reported to the others, and all then carried the body outside to the <i>zacate<\/i> field, where it was found; that subsequently they returned, procured several buckets of water and washed the floor, which had been stained with blood, changed their clothes, threatened her with death if she revealed what she had seen, when all but Arcangel departed.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>The testimony of this witness as to the amorous attentions paid her by two of the accused, Raymundo and Gutierrez, and by a municipal policeman, named Antonio Montealegre, who preceded the deceased in the precinct in which he was on duty on the night of the murder, tends to disclose, but not conclusively, a motive for the crime, in the jealousy which may have been aroused in the minds of her other suitors by her favorable reception of attentions from the municipal policeman.<br\/><br\/>Her testimony as to the manner in which the deceased was murdered and as to the connection of the accused with the commission of the crime is corroborated by independent evidence of the fact that all four of the accused were in the immediate vicinity of the scene of\u00a0 the crime at or about the time that it was committed; by the discovery of blood stains upon the floor of Arcangel's house at or about the place where she stated the crime was committed; by the location of the wounds upon the body of the deceased, which was such as to justify the inference that they were inflicted while Delgado was in a recumbent position; by the fact that, although the underclothes of the deceased were cut by the assassin's knives or bolos, his uniform was not injured, which renders it probable that he was off duty with his jacket thrown open when the murder was committed; and by evidence that cries were heard coming from the direction of the house of Arcangel at or about the time when she alleges the crime was committed, followed by loud barking of dogs, which she stated broke out immediately after the accused left the house with the body of the deceased:\u00a0 and her story is indirectly corroborated, by the fact that none of the details of the crime minutely and at length described' by her were put in doubt by the ocular examination of the scene of the crime by the trial court, or by the evidence as to the conditions existing there on the night when it was committed, and on the following morning when the police discovered the body.<br\/><br\/>As to the defendant, Raymundo, her testimony is conclusively corroborated by an extra judicial confession made by him in the presence of several police officers after he was arrested, wherein he gave a detailed account of the commission of the crime substantially identical with that given by Juliana; this confession disclosing, furthermore, that the murder was the result\u00a0 of a conspiracy between this accused and others, which had been in existence some ten days prior to the commission of the crime, and which had for its object the killing of a municipal policeman whose attentions were favorably received by Juliana.<br\/><br\/>As to the defendant, Arcangel, her testimony is substantially corroborated by his extrajudicial admissions and self-incriminating statements made after his arrest, wherein he admitted having participated in the commission of the crime and having struck one of the blows inflicted by the attacking party, although he insisted, (manifestly for the purpose of extenuating\u00a0 the criminality of the part taken by him) that the crime was committed on the street outside his house, and that he struck the deceased in the abdomen and not in the throat, as testified by Juliana.\u00a0 This accused at first denied having participated in the commission of the crime, but upon his confrontation with Raymundo in the police station, a dispute arose between them, in the course of which they charged each other with having inflicted the fatal wounds in the neck and throat of the deceased, each insisting that he himself struck the blow in the abdomen which was not supposed to be fatal.\u00a0 The admissions of this defendant also disclose his guilty connection with the conspiracy to kill the municipal policeman whose attentions to Juliana were resented by the murderers, at least as far back as 2 o'clock in the afternoon of the day upon which the crime was committed.<br\/><br\/>There is also evidence in the record\u2014the testimony of the witnesses Gabriel and Dullavin\u2014which tends to disclose the guilty knowledge of Raymundo, Leyva and Gutierrez of the commission of the crime, almost immediately after it had taken place, and an effort on their part to conceal the fact that they had been in the vicinity at that time; but the judgment of conviction in the court below rests substantially on the testimony of the witness Juliana Gutierrez, corroborated as to Raymundo and Arcangel by their respective extrajudicial confessions and admissions.<br\/><br\/>We agree with the trial judge, that \"the explanations of the accused are not sufficient to shake one's confidence in the story of Juliana;\" and that the testimony of the witnesses called on behalf of the different defendants is wholly unworthy of credit or belief.<br\/><br\/>Accepting the testimony of Juliana Gutierrez as true, as did the trial judge, there can be no reasonable doubt as to the guilt of all the accused as principals of the crime of assassination, since it is very clear that all of the accused took \"a direct part in the\u00a0 execution of the act,\" and that it was committed with <i>\"alevosia\"<\/i> (treachery), that is to say, that means were employed which tended directly and specially to insure the execution of the\u00a0 crime without risk to the person of the criminals arising from any\u00a0 defense which might be made by the injured party.\u00a0 (Arts. 10, 13, and 403, of the Penal Code;

S. <i>vs.<\/i> Wilson, 4 Phil. Rep., 317; U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> McGovern, 6 Phil. Rep., 621.)<br\/><br\/>The second assignment of error is completely disposed of by an examination of the voluminous record which clearly discloses that each of the defendants was in fact given a separate trial, the trial judge on various occasions calling the attention of counsel to this fact, and throughout the proceedings exercising marked precautions to secure to each of the accused the full and complete\u00a0 enjoyment of his right in this regard.\u00a0 The record of the trial of the appellant Pablo Raymundo will be found under its proper title, separate and apart, on pages 2 to 230 of the joint record in the court below (English version) ; the record of the trial of the appellant Felix Arcangel, on pages 231 to 397 of that joint record; and the record of the trial of the appellant Lorenzo Gutierrez, on pages 398 to 450 thereof.\u00a0 And while it is true that by agreement of counsel and with the consent of the accused under advice of counsel, \"the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution together with the cross-examination thereof\" taken on the trial of Arcangel was received in evidence in the separate trial of Gutierrez, counsel for Gutierrez reserving and exercising the right to recall and cross-examine these witnesses and further to introduce such\u00a0 evidence for the defense as he saw fit, it is manifest that the mere admission by consent or otherwise of a portion of the record in one criminal case on the trial of another criminal case, is in nowise equivalent to the trial of those cases together.<br\/><br\/>The third assignment of error is based on counsel's contention that the alleged extrajudicial confessions and admissions of Raymundo and Arcangel were not voluntary and therefore under the provisions of section 4 of Act No. 619, not competent evidence.\u00a0 It is alleged that these defendants were subjected to cruel and abusive treatment by the police to compel them to make these statements.\u00a0 But the record discloses that Arcangel did not introduce any testimony for the purpose of rebutting the testimony\u00a0 of the witnesses for the prosecution who swore to the contrary; and there is not a scintilla of evidence in the record of his separate trial which even tends to put in doubt the truth of the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution as to the voluntary admissions made by him, although these admissions taken together\u00a0 with the testimony of Juliana Gutierrez establish his guilty participation in the commission of the crime beyond a shadow of a doubt.\u00a0 And the evidence of record establishes beyond a reasonable doubt the falsity of the allegations of Raymundo that certain scars which he exhibited during the course of the proceedings were\u00a0 the result of maltreatment at the hands of the police, it having been conclusively proven that the injuries which produced these scars were received in a fight in which Raymundo took part prior to his arrest.\u00a0 We are satisfied that the overwhelming weight of the testimony establishes affirmatively the contention of the prosecution that these extrajudicial confessions and admissions were made voluntarily, and therefore that they were competent and admissible evidence against the defendants who made them.<br\/><br\/>As to the fifth assignment of error based on the alleged denial of the right of the accused to confront and cross-examine the witnesses called by the prosecution, which it is said was a necessary consequence of the fact that by agreement of counsel and with the consent of the accused, a part of the evidence taken in the trial of Arcangel was admitted on the trial of Gutierrez, it might be sufficient answer to cite the decision of this court in the case of United States <i>vs.<\/i> Anastasio (6 Phil. Rep., 413), wherein after an exhaustive discussion of the authorities, it was held that \"the right to be confronted with the witnesses in a criminal prosecution, as guaranteed by section 5 of the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902, is a personal one and may be waived.\"\u00a0 But it is worthy of observation that the accused having been given the privilege of recalling and cross-examining the witnesses whose testimony was admitted under the agreement, and the chief purpose of confrontation being to secure the opportunity for cross-examination (Greenleaf on Evidence, Vol. I, par. 163), appellant's substantial rights can not be said to have been prejudiced by the stipulation of which he now complains, which was entered into under the advice of counsel, in open court, and for reasons then considered sufficient by himself and his counsel.<br\/><br\/>We have heretofore held in the case of United States <i>vs.<\/i> Fernandez et\u00a0 al. (9 Phil. Rep,, 269) that \"when two or more defendants\u00a0 are\u00a0 charged in the same complaint and demand separate trials, the fact that the court rendered but one judgment, with separate findings of fact, is not reversible error, in the absence of timely objection;\" and where various defendants are charged in a single complaint or information with the commission of the same offense, we know of no provision of law which imposes upon the trial judge an obligation to set out his reasoning and to make his findings of fact and of law in separate opinions as to each of them, merely because they have been granted separate trials; we do not understand that in such cases the substantial rights of any of the defendants are in anywise prejudiced thereby, provided that the findings of fact and the conclusions of law based thereon as to each separate defendant are clearly set out, in such manner that they may be reviewed on appeal, separately and apart from the findings touching his codefendants in, the complaint or information.\u00a0 The right to a separate trial does not necessarily carry with it the right to be charged in a separate complaint or information before the actual trial has begun, or to have the opinion of the court, and the reasoning\u00a0 upon which it is based set out in a separate instrument after the actual trial of the accused has closed.\u00a0 The purpose and object of the provision of law securing to an accused person the right to a separate trial would not be advanced by a contrary holding; and on the other hand, such a ruling would in many cases impose a wholly unnecessary burden upon the trial courts.\u00a0 In the case at bar, we are of opinion, and so hold, that the trial judge commited no error in handing down his judgment as to each and all of the appellants in a single opinion or decision, the findings of fact and the conclusions of law as to each defendant being stated in such form that they may be considered and reviewed separately, and the rights of each defendant secured to him by the grant of a separate trial not being affected or in anyway impaired thereby.\u00a0 Trial has been defined to be \"the examination before a competent tribunal, according to the laws of the land, of the facts put in issue in a cause, for the purpose of determining such issue\" (4 Mass., 232), and such an examination of the facts put in issue by the plea of not guilty, entered by or for each of the defendants in this action, was granted to them, and it is clear that it is such a separate examination and no more that is secured to accused persons by the provisions of law as to separate trials in criminal causes.<br\/><br\/>We have already stated that in our opinion, based on a review of the whole record, the trial judge properly accepted as true the material testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution and properly rejected as unworthy of credit or belief the evidence introduced by the defense, in the separate trials given to the various appellants; and that there is no error <i>prejudicial to the rights of the accused<\/i> in his conclusions of law based on the facts disclosed by this testimony save his finding of the existence of deliberate premeditation as to Gutierrez; and as a further and extended discussion as to the credibility of the witnesses for the prosecution has been rendered necessary by the motion for a new trial submitted to this court on the ground of newly discovered evidence, it is unnecessary at this time to consider at length the assignments of error in this regard.<br\/><br\/>As to the contentions of appellants that the trial court improperly took into consideration extrajudicial confessions and admissions of some of the defendants as against their codefendants, it must be admitted that the trial court manifestly erred in this regard, though upon examination, it will be found that the substantial rights of the appellants were not prejudiced thereby.\u00a0 Subsection 6 of section 298 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that evidence may be given upon a trial \"after proof of a conspiracy\" of \"the act or declaration of a conspirator relating to the conspiracy,\" and the reason upon which this rule rests renders it as applicable in criminal as in civil trials; it always being understood, however, that \"acts and declarations of a conspirator can not be admitted as against a coconspirator, unless such acts were performed or declarations made in aid or execution of the conspiracy,\" and, therefore, that \"the acts and declarations must occur during the life of the combination, that is after the formation of the corrupt agreement, and before the consummation or abandonment of the object of the conspiracy.\"\u00a0 (8 Cyc, 680, 681, and cases there cited.)\u00a0 Applying this doctrine, it is evident that the trial court erred in finding in the extrajudicial confessions and admissions of Raymundo and Arcangel corroboration of the evidence introduced in the separate trial of their coaccused in the joint information, and proof of the existence of deliberate premeditation in the commission of the crime by the appellant Gutierrez.\u00a0 That he did so seems clear from the fact that except as it appears from these confessions and admissions there is no evidence in the record of the existence of a conspiracy, or of the connection of Gutierrez therewith, for any length of time prior to the commission of the crime, the facts admitted respectively by Raymundo and Arcangel being the only evidence in the record upon which a finding of deliberate pre-meditation could have been based; and also because an examination of the whole opinion, taken together with the following citation quoted therefrom in brief of counsel for Gutierrez, appears to sustain counsel's contention that not only as to Leyva, who is specifically mentioned in the citation, but also as to Gutierrez, the trial court took into consideration the extrajudicial statements made by Arcangel and Raymundo in making findings of fact as to the participation of Gutierrez in the commission of the crime.\u00a0 \"Apolonio Leyva is not named among the original conspirators of January 2.\u00a0 But his counsel is in error in stating that there is no testimony directly against him save that of Juliana Gutierrez, for Leyva is mentioned in Arcangel's confession\u00a0 as one of the participants in the affair, and the fact that Leyva\u00a0 is not so mentioned by Raymundo may well be due to the fact that the latter is the former's uncle.\"\u00a0 But as has already been shown, judgment of conviction of each of the appellants is fully sustained by the competent evidence adduced in each separate trial, without relying upon the testimony touching confessions or admissions by his alleged coconspirators, and this court having amended the finding of the trial court as to the commission of the crime by Gutierrez with deliberate pre-meditation, none of the appellants can be said to be prejudiced in any substantial right by the error of the trial court in this regard, since the findings of fact and the conclusions of law based thereon, (as clearly appears from the reasoning of the opinion of the court below, and from a review of the whole record) would be precisely the same, had the trial judge strictly limited himself to the competent evidence in\u00a0 the record of each separate trial in making the findings of fact disclosed thereby.<br\/><br\/>As to the contention that the trial court erred in taking into consideration other testimony taken at the trial of some of the accused as against their coaccused who were given separate trials,\u00a0 we think that an examination of the opinion of the trial court shows that it is not well founded.\u00a0 It is true, as pointed out by counsel for Gutierrez, that the trial judge found corroboration of the testimony of Juliana Gutierrez to the effect that the defendant Raymundo wore a gray suit which became smeared with blood in the testimony of the witness de la Cruz as to Raymundo's effort to send a message from the police station to friends outside to destroy certain blood-stained clothing, which was afterwards discovered at his home and introduced in evidence on his trial; and that the testimony of this witness was not taken at the trial of Gutierrez:\u00a0 but it is very clear that the trial judge, who had throughout the trial taken the utmost pains to secure to the various defendants their right to a separate trial, did not intend that his finding\u00a0 based on the testimony of this witness should be taken into consideration as a ground upon which his judgment of conviction of any other accused than Raymundo should rest, although it is also true that he does not expressly say so.\u00a0 And, however this may be, we are of opinion that the findings as to the guilt of Arcangel and Gutierrez are in nowise affected or weakened by the fact, even were it admitted as true, that in convicting them the trial judge had in mind the testimony\u00a0 of De la Cruz taken on the separate trial of Raymundo, as <i>additional<\/i> corroboration of the truth of the testimony of Juliana Gutierrez.<br\/><br\/>We find no error in the proceedings prejudicial to the rights of the appellants and we are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that\u00a0 the evidence of record establishes their guilt of the crime of assassination as found by the trial court, except that the record discloses the guilt of the appellant Gutierrez as a principal and not as an accomplice, and fails to sustain the finding of the trial court that the crime as committed by him was marked with the aggravating circumstance of deliberate premeditation.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of conviction of both and each of the appellants Raymundo and Arcangel as principals of the crime of assassination, marked with the aggravating circumstances of deliberate premeditation and nocturnity, and no extenuating circumstances, should be and is hereby affirmed and the sentences of death together with the accessory penalties prescribed by law, which were imposed upon both and each of these appellants are therefore affirmed, with a proportionate share of the costs of this appeal against each of them.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of conviction of the appellant Gutierrez of the crime of assassination, as pronounced by the trial court, should be modified by substituting for so much thereof as finds him \"guilty as accomplice\" a finding of \"guilty as principal,\" and by substituting for so much thereof as declares that the commission of the crime by him was marked with the aggravating circumstances of \"deliberate premeditation and nocturnity,\" a declaration that the only aggravating circumstance which it was proven marked the commission of the crime by this appellant was that of \"nocturnity,\" and thus modified the judgment of conviction of this appellant should be and is hereby affirmed.\u00a0 It appearing that this appellant was less than 18 years and more than 15 years old when the crime was committed, the sentence which should be imposed\u00a0 upon him as a principal in the commission of the crime is that immediately inferior to that prescribed in article 403 of the Penal Code, defining and penalizing the crime of assassination, that is to say, from the maximum degree of <i>presidio mayor<\/i> to the medium degree of <i>cadena temporal<\/i>, or from ten years and one day to seventeen years and four months' imprisonment; and since the evidence discloses that the crime committed by him was marked with the aggravating circumstance of nocturnity, and no extenuating circumstances, save that of age, this penalty should be imposed in its maximum degree.\u00a0 The penalty imposed by the trial judge (who while holding Gutierrez guilty merely as an accomplice and finding that he was less than 18 years of age, nevertheless took only one of those facts into consideration in fixing the penalty) was that of seventeen years and four month of <i>cadena temporal<\/i>, and the sentence imposed by the trial court upon this appellant, Gutierrez, should therefore be, and is hereby affirmed, with his proportionate share of the costs of this appeal against him. <br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Pastor against Ricardo F. Gutierrez, the court ordered the latter to vacate the apartments that he occupied, and to pay the plaintiff the sum of P35.33, P2 for his legal costs, and P5.12 as costs of the proceedings.\u00a0 A writ of execution was issued to enforce the payment of the said amounts, and on the 26th of November, 1907, the writ was returned unsatisfied.\u00a0 (2) That Vicente W. Pastor, in supplementary proceedings for the execution of the judgment, asked the court to summon the defendant Ricardo F. Gutierrez and The California-Manila Lumber Company, by which the defendant was employed, and to order the latter to produce in court the account books of its establishment, together with all other proofs that might be considered proper for the protection of the rights of the plaintiff.\u00a0 This was duly ordered by the said court on November 26, 1907, \"in order to testify and answer with regard to the property of the said defendant, and to comply with any other order which the court may consider proper in this matter.\"\u00a0 (3) That Ricardo F. Gutierrez appeared on the 11th of December, 1907, and declared under oath, that about the month of September, 1907, he purchased two small wardrobes, for the value of which, amounting to P45, he became indebted to The California-Manila Lumber Company of this city, where the said defendant was employed and is working; that the said articles of furniture were no longer in his possession for the reason that he had given them to a friend of his in Baliuag named Amalio Fernando, to whom he forwarded the same by rail, collect, in the latter part of September or the beginning of October, 1907, and that for the transportation of the said furniture from his house to the railway station he had paid the sum of 30 centavos.\u00a0 This sworn testimony was ratified by the accused on folio 123.\u00a0 (4) That the whole of said sworn declaration turned out to be untrue upon the confession of the accused, to whom' was put the following question:<br\/><blockquote>\"Q. Did you then know on that afternoon that your testimony in court was not the truth-that the wardrobes had not been sent?-A. Yes, sir; for that reason I went to Senor Machuca's office to arrange the matter.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Machuca testified that the accused Gutierrez had told him that his declaration in the court of the justice of the peace was not true, and that he had made such declaration because the attorney of The California-Manila Lumber Company had advised him to do so.\u00a0 (5) That having been convicted of perjury on the above and other evidence, the court below sentenced him as above set forth.\u00a0 (6) That in this instance the defense has alleged against the judgment, first, that it is contrary to law, and second that it is contrary to the evidence.<br\/><br\/>This second point is put forward with the allegation that the statement of the accused before the justice of the peace was not made with the knowledge that it was false, an allegation that can not be considered because it is a circumstance that is not expressly referred to in the law, and for the further reason that it is set forth in the proceedings, without any protest on the part of the accused or his counsel, that he had knowingly testified falsely.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the first point, it is alleged that the false testimony punished by article 321 of the Penal Code is that which is given in a civil cause, and that the proceedings supplementary to an execution, in which the accused gave the testimony considered to be false, is not a civil cause.<br\/><br\/>Article 321 of the Penal Code says:<br\/><blockquote>\"False testimony given in a civil cause shall be punished with a penalty of <i>arresto mayor<\/i> in its maximum degree to <i>presidio correccional<\/i> in its medium degree and a fine of from 625 to 6,250 pesetas.<br\/><br\/>If the amount of the claim should not exceed 625 pesetas, the penalties shall be those of <i>arresto mayor<\/i> and a fine of from 325 to 3,250 pesetas.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>What should be considered as a \"civil cause\" under the terms of this article, is defined by the penal jurisprudence of Spain, which considers as such every proceeding wherein opposing interests are contested; under Spanish jurisprudence, if false testimony were given in supplementary proceedings for the execution of a civil action, it would nevertheless be false testimony in a civil cause.<br\/><br\/>Perjury committed by a party in his own cause would not be punishable under Spanish legislation, because in said legislation no one was a witness in his own cause, and could not therefore become guilty of giving false testimony in a civil cause in which he was either the plaintiff or the defendant; but under the procedure in force by virtue of Act No. 190, a party to a suit may testify in his own behalf, and if he declares falsely under oath as a witness in his own cause, like any other witness, he incurs the penalty by which false testimony in civil matters is repressed and punished.\u00a0 This court has so held, it being a settled rule, that the false testimony given by a litigant as a witness constitutes the crime of giving false testimony inasmuch as such a declaration, according to the new laws in force, may determine a judgment in his favor and to the prejudice of the adverse party, and that a litigant who, in sworn testimony given by him as a witness in a civil cause, shall pervert the truth and give false testimony, incurs as such witness the penalties imposed by article 321 of the Penal Code.\u00a0 As grounds for its judgment the court below said:<br\/><blockquote>\"A question has arisen as to whether or not a supplementary proceeding is a 'civil cause' in order that it may be included within the meaning of article 321 of the Penal Code.\u00a0 The word 'cause' has been judicially defined as 'any legal process which a party institutes to enforce his demand, or by which he seeks his right, or supposed right.'\u00a0 (<i>Ex parte<\/i> Milligan, 4 Wall. [71 U. S.], 112.) It embraces an action for temporary attachment (Logan <i>vs<\/i>. Small, 43 Mo., 255), proceedings for contempt (Lainont <i>vs<\/i>. Ward, 36 Wis., 559; Taylor <i>vs<\/i>. U. S., 45 Fed., 531), an alternative order to show cause why a new trial should not be ordered (Haupt <i>vs<\/i>. Henninger, 37 Pa. St., 141), and a report of arbitrators (Preston <i>vs<\/i>. Englert, 5 Bonn., Pa., 390).\u00a0 It appears that in the expression 'civil cause proceedings supplementary to an execution may be included as well as any of the cases cited above.\u00a0 And even more, to limit the application of article 321 to ordinary actions would be to reduce its operation to narrow limits, to lessen the usefulness of every special and collateral proceeding, and in many cases would work an injustice.\u00a0 It is not believed that such an interpretation is supported by sound principles of law or jurisprudence.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>For the reasons above set forth the judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed in the main, that is, so far as the accused is sentenced to imprisonment for two months and one day, which imprisonment shall be of <i>arresto mayor<\/i>, and it is modified with regard to the fine which, according to paragraph 2 of article 321, can not exceed 3,250 pesetas nor be less than 325.\u00a0 We therefore impose the minimum fine, to wit, the sum of P65, with the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment, and the costs of the first instance, as imposed in the said judgment, in addition to the costs of this instance.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson, Willard<\/i>, and <i>Tracey, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><\/div>",

No. 5110, August 19, 1909<\/h2>\n<h3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, <i>VS.<\/i> FABIANA LEGASPI AND PAULINO PULONGBARET, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>CARSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">The appellants were charged with the crime of adultery in an information couched in the following language:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"The undersigned accuses Fabiana Legaspi and Paulino Pulongbaret with the crime of adultery committed as follows;<br\/><br\/>\"That on or about the 23d day of March, 1908, in the city of Manila, P. I., the accused Fabiana Legaspi was at the said time and place a married woman in that she was united in wedlock to a certain Sotero Cruz; that the accused Paulino Pulongbaret, at the said time and place, had knowledge that the said Fabiana Legaspi was legally married to the said Sotero Cruz; that the said accused\u00a0 Paulino Pulongbaret and Fabiana Legaspi did willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously lie together and have sexual intercourse.\u00a0 All contrary to law.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>Counsel for appellants contends that the information is insufficient, and does not charge the defendants or either of them with any crime; and further that the evidence of record does not establish beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of illicit relations or carnal access between the defendants, and fails to sustain a finding of their guilt of any crime.<br\/><br\/>It will be seen from an examination of the above set out information that it clearly and succinctly sets out:\u00a0 First, the names of the defendants; second, the designation\u00a0 of the crime charged; third, the acts complained of as constituting the crime, in ordinary and concise language, and in such form as to enable a person of common understanding to know what is intended and the court to pronounce judgment according to right; fourth, that the offense was committed within the jurisdiction of the court; and fifth, the name of the offended party.\u00a0 It is, therefore, under the provisions of section 6 of General Orders, No. 58, a sufficient information.<br\/><br\/>The husband, who was the complaining witness, testified that at about 10 o'clock on the evening of the day set out in the complaint, he found that his wife had left his house; that his suspicions of her fidelity having been previously aroused he went in search of her; that he found her in the house of her aunt, and without entering watched the house until the shutters of the window through which he could see her from the street were closed; that he then crept up to the window and was able to observe what went on inside through a crack in the shutter; that he there and then discovered the two accused <i>flagrante delicto<\/i>; that he then without giving them any warning called upon the policeman upon duty in that neighborhood to arrest them; that the policeman at first refused to take any action, and only did so when the witness procured a written order from the sergeant at the local police station; that the policeman then joined the witness, and creeping up to the shutter through which the witness had previously observed the movements of the accused, discovered them in bed together, and forthwith arrested them.<br\/><br\/>The testimony of the husband is satisfactory corroborated by the testimony of the policeman, who appears to have been a wholly disinterested witness, and to have been called upon for assistance\u00a0 by the complaining witness for the sole reason that he happened to be on duty on his beat at the time when and near the place where the crime was committed.<br\/><br\/>The defendant, Fabiana Legaspi, did not testify in her own behalf, but her codefendant admitted that at the time when the arrest was made he was alone in the room with his codefendant; he also admitted that she was at that time in bed, but he denied that he was in bed with her, or had any criminal relations with her.<br\/><br\/>We do not think that the statement of this accused is sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as to the truth of the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution, which fully establishes the guilt of both the accused as charged in the complaint; and, as pointed out by the trial judge, the admissions of this accused would in themselves appear to be sufficient to establish the commission of the crime; for the <i>unexplained<\/i> fact that a man is found at a late hour of the night, alone in a room with another man's wife, she being in bed, and absent from her husband's home without his consent, and as far as she knew without his knowledge, would seem to be sufficient to sustain a conviction of the crime of adultery.\u00a0 Proof of the commission of the crime of adultery, like proof of the commission of most other crimes, may safely be rested on circumstantial evidence when that evidence is such that it leaves no room for reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused, and, indeed, contrary to the contention of counsel for appellants, convictions for this crime have frequently been had without direct evidence as to the specific acts constituting the offense, as will appear from the following citations from decisions of the <i>Tribunal Supremo de Espa\u00f1a<\/i>:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"The finding in the possession of a married woman of several love letters signed by her paramour; their having been seen together in different places, and finally, the fact that they were surprised in a well-known assignation house which the accused woman admitted having visited six times in company with the former, are data and indications sufficient to convict them both of the crime of adultery; because, as the supreme court of Spain says, it shows without doubt not only their illicit relations but also such <i>acts as constitute adultery<\/i> and are the consequence of said relations.'\"\u00a0 (Decision of the 23d of June, 1874.)<br\/><br\/>\"First.\u00a0 It having reached the knowledge of * * * that his wife was living in intimacy with * * * known by the name of * * * instead of remaining in the house of * * * where she was placed, he asked for and obtained from the court a warrant to enter and search the residence of the keeper * * *, at any time of the night and when this was done by the proper authorities, on the morning of January 5, last, they found * * * and * * * in the only bedroom that there was in the house, and in which there was but one bed, partially disrobed, the bed with evident signs of having been used, while the clothes of both were mixed together.\" <\/blockquote> <br\/>The trial court, in imposing the penalty, gave the accused the benefit of the provisions of article 11 of the Penal Code, and sentenced them to two years, four months, and one day of <i>prision correccional<\/i>, that being the minimum penalty prescribed for the crime of adultery: there is nothing in the record which discloses that the defendants are members of uncivilized or semicivilized tribes or persons of notably low order of intelligence, nor does it appear that the commission of the crime of adultery, of which they were convicted, was marked by such exceptional circumstances as to suggest a holding that they are entitled to the benefit of the provisions of this article, and this court has in general declined to affirm the extension of the benefits of its provisions to persons convicted of the crime of adultery.\u00a0 (U.

because the first sum of 268 pesetas and 50 centimos is simply a civil debt in favor of said Sr. Biunas, and the payment of the costs is a civil liability in favor of the government; and there exists no law in the Philippine Islands which authorizes subsidiary imprisonment for the payment of a civil debt and for the payment<br\/>of the costs of the action.<br\/><br\/>\"2.\u00a0 That the court erred in affirming the said judgment and the penalty imposed thereunder in that it violated the provisions of section 5 of the Act of Congress passed July 1, 1902, which says: 'That no law shall be enacted in said Islands which shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law or deny to any person therein the equal\u00a0 protection of the law;' because the imposition of subsidiary imprisonment by reason of insolvency is equivalent, first, to establish differences in the application of the law to the poor and to the rich, thereby permitting the rich to go free and the poor alone to suffer; and second, to imposing a penalty not provided for in the Penal Code of the Philippine Islands.<br\/><br\/>\"3.\u00a0 That the court erred in affirming the judgment and the sentence of conviction because the\u00a0 same violated the provisions of said Act of the Congress of the United States, section 5, in which\u00a0 it says:\u00a0 <i>'That no person shall be imprisoned for debt;<\/i>' because even supposing that the Spanish laws relating to subsidiary imprisonment are not abolished, it, nevertheless, is certain that the said Act of Congress prohibits the application of those rules and regulations which establish subsidiary imprisonment in default of the payment of an indemnity or debt.\"<br\/><br\/><\/blockquote>In his printed brief before this court (there, was no oral argument) the appellant made the following assignment of errors:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"The court erred:<br\/><br\/>\"1.\u00a0 In overruling the demurrer interposed by the accused Sy Chuy Chin against the information.<br\/><br\/>\"2.\u00a0 In declaring proved the facts alleged in the information against the said Sy Chuy Chin.<br\/><br\/>\"3.\u00a0 In declaring the said Sy Chuy Chin guilty of the crime of <i>estafa<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>\"4.\u00a0 In not absolving the said accused-first, because the facts alleged do not constitute a crime, and second, because there was a failure of the proofs.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>In his printed brief of 13 pages the appellant confined himself strictly to a discussion of the errors assigned.<br\/><br\/>Nowhere, either in the assignment of errors or in the discussion thereof, did the appellant raise any of the questions now presented in the assignment of errors accompanying his petition for the writ of error.\u00a0 At no time during the course of the trial or in the appeal presented and argued in this court was the remotest reference made to any of those questions.\u00a0 They were presented for the first time on his petition for the writ of error.\u00a0 The trial court had no opportunity to pass on those questions.\u00a0 This court has had none.\u00a0 The appellant is therefore not entitled to the writ upon the showing made.\u00a0 (Linford <i>vs.<\/i> Ellison, 155 U.

the second is also hemp land, with an area of about one <i>pisoson<\/i>, the boundaries of which are the following:\u00a0 lands of Ramon Nunez, lands of Carlos Nano, lands of Eugenio Aguilar, and a small river; the third is also hemp land, with an area of about two <i>pisosones<\/i>, the boundaries of which are:\u00a0 land of Antonio Mujal, the road leading to the <i>visita<\/i>, a small river, and land of Antonia Marquez; the fourth, the same as the foregoing, with an area of about half a <i>pisoson<\/i>, the boundaries of which are:\u00a0 land of Don Guillermo Nieves, land of Antonia Marquez, land of Antonio Mujal, land of Eduardo Mortiga, and the road to the <i>visita<\/i> of Cotmon; the fifth, planted with hemp and coeoanuts, has an area of about seven <i>pisosones<\/i>, the boundaries of which are:\u00a0 lands of Eduardo Mortiga, Calixto Nasagao, Juan Aguilar, Pedro Moros, Francisco Flores, Benito Vivar, and Temas Gomez; and the sixth is hemp land, with an area of about half a <i>pisoson<\/i>, the boundaries of which are as follows:\u00a0 lands of Eulalio Ticui, Domingo Villaraza, Pedro Moros, and Francisco Flores.\u00a0 And inasmuch as, on account of our said general and legitimate succession, we are indebted to Do\u00f1a Maria Jimenez in the sum of 20,000 pesos, we make a real and perpetual cession of the six parcels of land above-mentioned in favor of our creditor Do\u00f1a Maria Jimenez, on account of the said debt, to the extent of 1,300 pesos, which is the value of the said lands, and should the same be worth more, we make a donation thereof, <i>inter vivos<\/i> or nonreversible, in favor of the said Do\u00f1a Maria Jimenez, to whom we deliver and convey the same with the exclusive use, profits, and benefits that appertain to them according to law, the said Do\u00f1a Maria Jimenez taking possession thereof as the legitimate owner by title of lawful purchase, and we waiving all rules, privileges, and general provisions of law applicable to this contract.<br\/><br\/>\"And as this document shows that the sum in which the lands herein described were assessed does not cover the amount owing, the balance, that is, 15,000 pesos, we jointly and severally bind ourselves to pay to Do\u00f1a Maria Jimenez, or to her successors, all the sums which may be paid to us by our debtors, and in case our financial condition should improve, with or without the payments made by our debtors, we shall pay the balance still due at its maturity;

and if, by reason of nonpayment by our debtors, or that our condition does not improve in such manner that we can pay our debt, the same shall be by this liquidation forever settled.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>From a reading of this clause of the contract it would seem to be clear that the promise of the defendants was based upon one of two provisions:.<br\/><br\/>(<i>a<\/i>) The collection of all or of a part at least of certain debts existing in favor of the said Pedro Jimenez, or<br\/><br\/>(<i>b<\/i>) The improvement of the financial condition of the said defendants,<br\/><br\/>The terms of this condition are in the alternative.\u00a0 It would seem, therefore, that, if the defendants had collected the said debts or had improved their financial condition, either one or the other, the conditional provision of the contract would become absolute and they would be liable in an action.\u00a0 There is nothing in the contract which indicates to what extent the financial condition of the defendants should be improved before they would be liable under that provision of their contract.\u00a0 Neither do we now pass upon that question, for the reason that the evidence clearly shows that their financial condition at the time of the trial of the cause, or at the time the action was commenced was no better than it was at the time of the making of the said contract (January 1, 1889).\u00a0 Neither do we pass upon the question as to how much of the said debts should be collected before the other condition of the contract should become absolute, for the reason that the evidence discloses beyond peradventure of doubt that the defendants up to and including the time of the trial of said cause had been unable to collect any of said credits whatever.<br\/><br\/>No objection was made as to the validity of the contract.\u00a0 Neither does it seem that any could be made because neither by the terms of the contract nor the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause does it appear that its provisions were in contravention of law, morals, or public order.<br\/><br\/>At the death of Don Pedro Jimenez, the said Do\u00f1a Maria Jimenez, in favor of whom said obligation existed, had the right to insist upon the payment of said obligation out of the estate of the said Pedro Jimenez.\u00a0 But, instead of insisting upon the payment of her claim out of the estate, she accepted the present contract in lieu of such right, thereby postponing the payment of her obligation against the estate of the said Pedro Jimenez until the compliance with the conditions mentioned in said contract.<br\/><br\/>It is our opinion, and we so hold, that the right of the plaintiffs to recover the sum mentioned in said contract depends upon the conditions mentioned therein.\u00a0 The plaintiff having failed to show that one or the other of the conditions of said contract had been complied with, the action on the part of the plaintiffs was immature, and therefore the judgment of the lower court is hereby reversed, and it is ordered that a judgment be rendered in favor of the defendants and against the plaintiffs, dismissing the said complaint without prejudice, with costs.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano,\u00a0 C.

J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">The defendant is charged with the\u00a0 violation of section 1 of Act No. 1696 of the Philippine Commission, which reads as follows:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"Any person who shall expose, or cause or permit to be exposed, to public view on his own premises, or who shall expose, or cause to be exposed, to public view, either on his own premises or elsewhere, any flag, banner, emblem, or device used during the late insurrection in the Philippine Islands to designate or identify those in armed rebellion against the United States, or any flag, banner, emblem, or device used or adopted at any time by the public enemies of the United\u00a0 States in the Philippine Islands\u00a0 for the purposes of public disorder or of rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the United States in the Philippine Islands, or any flag, banner, emblem, or device of the Katipunan Society, or which is commonly known as such, shall be punished by a fine of not less than five hundred pesos nor more than five thousand pesos, or by imprisonment for not less than three months nor more than five years, or by both such fine and imprisonment, in the discretion of the court.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>The defendant was tried in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila on the 8th day of September, 1908.\u00a0 After hearing the evidence adduced the court adjudged the defendant guilty of the crime charged and sentenced him under that judgment to pay a fine of P500, Philippine currency, and to pay the costs of the action, and to suffer subsidiary imprisonment during the time and in the form and in the place prescribed by law until said fine should be paid.\u00a0 From that judgment and sentence the defendant appealed to this court.<br\/><br\/>A careful examination of the record brought to this court discloses the following facts:<br\/><br\/>That on or about the 4th day of August, 1908, in the city of Manila, the appellant Go Chico displayed in one of the windows and one of the show cases of his store, No. 89 Calle Rosario, a number\u00a0 of medallions, in the form of a small button, upon the faces of which were imprinted in miniature the picture of Emilio Aguinaldo, and the flag or banner or device used during the late insurrection\u00a0 in the Philippine Islands to designate and identify those in armed insurrection against the United States.\u00a0\u00a0 On the day previous to the one above set forth the appellant had purchased the stock of goods in said store, of which\u00a0 the medallions formed a part, at a public sale made under authority of the sheriff of the city of Manila.\u00a0 On the day in question, the 4th of August aforesaid, the appellant was arranging his stock of goods for the purpose of displaying them to the public and in so doing placed in his showcase and in one of the windows of his store the medallions described.\u00a0 The appellant was ignorant of the existence of a law against the display of the medallions in question and had consequently no corrupt intention.\u00a0 The facts above stated are admitted.<br\/><br\/>The appellant rests his right to acquittal upon two propositions:<br\/><br\/>First.\u00a0 That before a conviction under the law cited can be had, a criminal intent upon the part of the accused must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.<br\/><br\/>Second.\u00a0 That the prohibition of the law is directed against the use of the identical banners, devices, or emblems actually used during the Philippine insurrection by those in armed rebellion against the United States.<br\/><br\/>In the opinion of this court it is not necessary that the appellant should have acted with criminal intent.\u00a0 In many crimes,\u00a0 made such by statutory enactment, the intention of the person who commits the crime is entirely immaterial.\u00a0 This is necessarily so.\u00a0 If it were not, the statute as a deterrent influence would be substantially worthless.\u00a0 It would be impossible of execution.\u00a0 In many cases the act complained of is itself that which produces the pernicious effect which the statute seeks to avoid.\u00a0 In those cases the pernicious effect is produced with precisely the same force and result whether the intention of the person performing the act is good or bad.\u00a0 The case at bar is a perfect illustration\u00a0 of this.\u00a0 The display of a flag or emblem used, particularly within a recent period, by the enemies of the Government tends to incite resistance to governmental functions and insurrection against governmental authority just as effectively if made in the best of good faith as if made with the most corrupt intent.\u00a0 The display itself, without the intervention of any other factor, is the evil.\u00a0 It is quite different from that large class of crimes, made such by the common law or by statute, in which the injurious effect upon the public depends upon the corrupt intention of the person perpetrating the act.\u00a0 If A discharges a loaded gun and kills B, the interest which society has in the act depends, not upon B's death, but upon the intention with which A consummated the act.\u00a0 If the gun were discharged intentionally, with the purpose of accomplishing the death of B, then society has been injured and its security violated; but if the gun was discharged accidentally on the part of A, then society, strictly speaking, has no concern in the matter, even though the death of B results.\u00a0\u00a0 The reason for this is that A does not become a danger to society and its institutions until he becomes a person with a corrupt mind.\u00a0 The mere discharge of the gun and the death of B do not of themselves make him so.\u00a0 With those two facts must go the corrupt intent to kill.\u00a0 In the case at bar, however, the evil to society\u00a0 and to the Government does not depend upon the state of mind of the one who displays the banner, but upon the effect which that display has upon the public mind.\u00a0 In the one case the public is affected by the intention of the actor; in the other by the act itself.<br\/><br\/>It is stated in volume 12 of Cyc, page 148, that-<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"The legislature, however, may forbid the\u00a0 doing of an act and make its commission a crime without regard to the intent of the doer, and if such an intention appears the courts must give it effect although the intention may have been innocent.\u00a0 Whether or not in a given case the statute is to be so construed is to be determined by the court by considering the subject-matter of the prohibition as well as the language of the statute, and thus ascertaining the intention of the legislature.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>In the case of The People <i>vs.<\/i> Kibler (106 N. Y., 321) the defendant was charged\u00a0 with the sale of\u00a0 adulterated milk under a statute reading as follows:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"No person or persons shall sell or exchange or expose for sale or exchange any unclean, impure, unhealthy, adulterated, of unwholesome milk.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>It was proved in that case that one Vandenburg purchased at the defendant's store 1 pint of milk which was shown to contain a very small percentage of water more than that permitted by the statute.\u00a0\u00a0 There was no dispute about the facts, but the objection made by the defendant was that he was not allowed, upon the trial, to show an absence of criminal intent, or go to the jury upon the question whether it existed, but was condemned under a charge from the court which made his intent totally immaterial and his guilt consist in having sold the adulterated article whether he knew it or not and however carefully he may have sought to keep on hand and sell the genuine article.<br\/><br\/>The opinion of the court in that case says:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"As the law stands, knowledge or intention forms no element of the offense.\u00a0 The act alone, irrespective of its motive, constitutes the crime.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0

case of Gardner <i>vs.<\/i> The People (62 N.\u00a0 Y., 299) the question arose under a statute which provided that an inspector of elections of the city of New York should not be removed from office except \"after notice in writing to the officer sought to be removed, which notice shall set forth clearly and distinctly the reasons for his removal and further provided that any person who removed such an officer without such notice should be guilty of a misdemeanor.\u00a0 An officer named Sheridan was removed by Gardner, the defendant, without notice.\u00a0 Gardner was arrested and convicted of a misdemeanor under the statute.\u00a0 He appealed from the judgment of conviction and the opinion from which the following quotation is made was written upon the decision of that appeal.\u00a0 Chief Justice Church, writing the opinion of the court, says in relation to criminal intent:<br\/><br\/>\"In short, the defense was an honest misconstruction of the law under legal advice.\u00a0 The

ABREU, JUDGE OF FIRST INSTANCE, RESPONDENTS.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>WILLARD, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">This is an action of mandamus brought originally in this court.\u00a0 The defendants appeared and answered and the plaintiff has moved for judgment upon the pleadings.<br\/><br\/>The proceeding in the court below was one brought under the provisions of section 709 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u00a0 That section is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"If an executor or administrator, heir, legatee, creditor, or other person interested in the estate of a deceased person complains to the court having jurisdiction of the estate, that a person is suspected of having concealed, embezzled, or conveyed away any of the money, goods, or chattels of the deceased, or that such person has in his possession, or lias knowledge of any deed, conveyance, bond, contract, or other writing which contains evidence of, or tends to disclose the right, title, interest, or claim of the deceased to real or personal estate, or the last will and testament of the deceased, the court may cite such suspected person to appear before it, and may examine him on oath on the matter of such complaint; if the person so cited refuses to appear and answer such examination, or to answer such interrogatories as are put to him, the court may, by warrant, commit him to the jail or prison of the province, there to remain in close custody until he submits to the order of the court; and such interrogatories and answers shall be in writing and signed by the party examined, and filed in the clerk's office.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>On the 4th of September, 1908, the plaintiff filed a petition in the Court of First Instance of the Province of Romblon-Capiz, asking that the defendant Anacleta Madrilejos be cited to appear and answer with reference to certain books, documents, and papers belonging to the estate, which the administrator claimed she had in her possession, and that when it was proved that they were in her possession, the court ordered their immediate delivery to the administrator.\u00a0 A citation having been issued, Anacleta Madrilejos appeared and filed a written answer denying that she had the documents in her possession.\u00a0 She was afterwards examined under oath in court as to the possession of these documents, when she again denied that she had them in her possession.\u00a0 The court thereupon ordered that her declaration thus made in open court be read to her and that she sign it, and that it be filed in the clerk's office.\u00a0 The plaintiff then offered to prove by other witnesses that notwithstanding the denial of the defendant she did have these books, documents, and papers in her possession.\u00a0 The court refused to admit this evidence and held that section 709 did not contemplate the trial of any issue of fact as to the actual possession of the property nor did it contemplate the making of any order by the court directing the delivery to the administrator of property which the court might decide to be in the possession of the defendant, but that when the defendant had appeared and been examined and her testimony had been signed by her and filed, the proceeding was ended.\u00a0 In support of this view the court below cited Werner's American Law of Administration, volume 2, paragraph 325.<br\/><br\/>No further proceedings apparently were taken in the court below and the plaintiff has applied to this court for a writ of mandamus directing the judge to continue the proceeding in the court below and receive such proofs as the parties might offer.<br\/><br\/>Whether or not the order made by the court below was a final order made in special proceedings from which the plaintiff might have appealed, we do not decide, because we agree with the court below in his view concerning the construction of section 709.<br\/><br\/>It was said in the argument by the plaintiff that no question of title to property is involved in this proceeding, the defendant not claiming to be entitled to the possession of the documents referred to in the petition.\u00a0 But if the plaintiff's theory in regard to section 709 is correct, the court would be bound in a case where the defendant admitted his possession of personal property other than documents and papers and claimed to be the owner thereof to try that litigated question in this summary proceeding and determine what the rights of the parties were to the property involved.\u00a0 It will be observed that the section nowhere expressly gives the court any such power.\u00a0 The usual way of determining the rights of contending parties to the ownership of property is by the institution of an ordinary action.\u00a0 This is true whether the property in question belongs to the estate of a deceased person or not.\u00a0 That it was contemplated that this ordinary proceeding should be followed in cases relating to property of a deceased person embezzled or alienated by a third person is apparent from section 711, which is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"If a person, before the granting of letters testamentary or of administration on the estate of a deceased person, embezzles, or alienates, any of the money, goods, chattels, or effects of such deceased person, such person shall be' liable to an action in favor of the executor or administrator of such estate for double the value of the property sold, embezzled, or alienated, to be recovered for the benefit of such estate.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>There are provisions in section 709 which indicate that it was not the intention of the legislator to provide in that proceeding for a trial as to the ownership of property.\u00a0 It is not necessary in the petition filed therein to allege that the defendant has in fact concealed, embezzled, or conveyed away any property.\u00a0 It is sufficient to allege that the plaintiff suspects that he has done it.<br\/><br\/>It is to be noted, moreover, that the proceeding may be commenced by a creditor of the estate.\u00a0 It can not be supposed that the legislator intended to allow a creditor to litigate with a third person the title to property claimed to belong to an estate in a proceeding in which the administrator was not a party and in which the estate was not represented.<br\/><br\/>The subject-matter here in litigation has appeared in this court twice before.\u00a0 (Chanco <i>vs<\/i>. Madrilejos, 5 Phil. Rep., 319, and Chanco <i>vs<\/i>. Madrilejos, 9 Phil. Rep,, 356.)\u00a0 It was not held in the latter case, as appears to be claimed by the plaintiff, that the proper proceeding for the recovery of the possession of these documents was that indicated by section 709.\u00a0 On the contrary, the court said at page 362:<br\/><blockquote>\"If the plaintiff desired to obtain possession of documents which were supposed to be in the possession of the defendant, it was his duty to proceed by the proper form of subpoena and not by the method followed in this particular case.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>As the views above expressed dispose, of the case upon its merits, it is ordered that judgment be entered in favor of the defendants, acquitting them of the complaint, with the costs against the plaintiff.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Burritt, then acting as judge in said province, granted the petition of the\u00a0 said administratrix, giving her permission to sell the said house and lot.<br\/><br\/>Sixth.\u00a0 On the 19th day of October, 1905, the Hon. Charles S. Lobingier, then acting as judge of the Court of First Instance of said province, appointed commissioners to appraise the property and to consider claims against the said estate.\u00a0 The record does not disclose why these commissioners were not appointed in accordance with the provisions of the law on the 28th of February, 1905, at the time the said Ruperta Orais was appointed as administratrix of the said estate.\u00a0 The court appointed three commissioners who, upon the 31st of October, 1905 after having considered some of the claims presented against the estate, made their report.<br\/><br\/>Seventh.\u00a0 On, the 8th day of November, 1905, Januario Miel, who had presented a claim against the estate and which was partially denied, appealed from the findings of the said commissioners to the Court of First Instance of the said province.<br\/><br\/>Eighth.\u00a0 On the 28th day of May, 1907, the administratrix and the said Januario Miel entered into an agreement by which the claim of the said Miel against the said estate should be submitted to arbitrators.\u00a0 Later (the exact date does not appear of record), the said arbitrators made their report, finding that the said estate owed to the said Januario Miel the sum of P591.65.<br\/><br\/>Ninth.\u00a0 On the 5th day of June, 1907, the said Januario Miel presented a motion in the Court of First Instance of the Province of Leyte, praying that the order of the Hon. Charles H. Burritt of the 22d of September, 1905, authorizing the administratrix to sell the house and lot belonging to the said estate to Jacinta Esca\u00f1o, be annulled, and that the said administratrix be directed to pay the claim of P591.65, the amount allowed by the said arbitrators, to the said petitioner, Januario Miel.<br\/><br\/>Tenth.\u00a0 On the 24th day of June, 1907, the Hon. W. F. Norris, then acting as judge of the Court of First Instance of said province, upon a consideration of the petition to set aside or annul the order of the 22d of September, 1905, granted the same and did annul and set it aside.\u00a0 From this order of the Hon. W. F. Norris, Jacinta Esca\u00f1o appealed to this court, giving a bond in conformity with the requirements of law.<br\/><br\/>The only assignment of error made by the appellant, Jacinta Esca\u00f1o, is that the Hon. W. F. Norris committed an error in setting aside the order of the Hon. Charles H. Burritt authorizing the administratrix to sell the said house and lot.<br\/><br\/>The Code of Procedure in Civil Actions points out the method for the settlement of the estates of deceased persons.\u00a0 Section 669 provides that the court, at the time of granting letters testamentary or of administration, etc., shall appoint a committee of two or more disinterested persons to appraise the estate of the\u00a0 deceased and allow claims against the estate, and the executor or administrator shall cause an inventory of the estate to be made.<br\/><br\/>An examination of the record in the present case shows that nearly two years after the appointment of the said administratrix the\u00a0 same judge appointed the committee provided for in this section.\u00a0 The record shows that the committee considered claims against\u00a0 the\u00a0 estate, but does not show that the said committee ever appraised the estate of the deceased.\u00a0 From the record it appears that the commission to appraise the property of the estate and to consider claims\u00a0 against the same was appointed on the 19th day of October, 1905, and that they made their report on the 31st day of October, 1905; in other words, that they made their report eleven days after their appointment.<br\/><br\/>Section 687 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions provides, among other things that they shall publish for three weeks successively, in a newspaper of general circulation in the province, the times and places of their meetings.\u00a0 Nothing in the record shows that they complied with this provision of law.<br\/><br\/>The Code of Procedure in Civil Actions also provides the method by which administrators, etc., of estates may sell both the real and personal property.\u00a0 (See sees. 714, 716, 718.)\u00a0 Said code also prescribes the condition under which administrators may sell and disburse the real and personal property of estates of a deceased person.\u00a0 (See sec. 722.)\u00a0 The lower court held that a compliance with the provisions of said section 722 was jurisdictional, and that unless the provisions of this section had been complied with, a sale by an administrator of the property of an estate was null and void.\u00a0 There is nothing in the record to show that the administratrix in the present case, in her petition for permission to sell the house and lot in question, had complied with the provisions of said section 722.\u00a0 The appellant argues that the purchaser of said property was a purchaser in good faith and that the sale and purchase were made in pursuance of an order of the\u00a0 court, and therefore his interest should not now be disturbed.<br\/><br\/>It is not shown that the purchaser of the property, Jacinta Esca\u00f1o, had received any notice of the motion to set aside the sale.\u00a0 Nearly two years had elapsed between the sale and the motion.\u00a0 The sale was made under an order of the court.\u00a0 The purchaser had a right to believe that the court had complied with the law and that she\u00a0 had, therefore, obtained a good title.\u00a0 Whether she had obtained a good title or not she certainly was entitled to notice before any action was taken by the court by which she should be deprived of her little.\u00a0 Judges of coordinate jurisdiction, acting within the same jurisdiction, should not annul or set aside orders made by other judges of equal jurisdiction, until some new fact or condition is presented.\u00a0 The parties should be compelled to take their exception and wait for a final decision and if not then corrected, to appeal from alleged illegal orders.\u00a0 As a general rule a judge has no power to review, on the same facts, the decision of a coordinate judge, the remedy being by appeal.\u00a0 (23 Cyclopedia of Law and Procedure, 540; see also Platt <i>vs.<\/i> N. Y., etc., Ry. Co., 170 N. Y., 451; Harris <i>vs.<\/i> Clark, 10 Howard's Practice (N. Y,),415.)<br\/><br\/>In our opinion the order of the Hon. W. F. Norris, nullifying the order of the Hon. Charles H. Burritt, was improper, and therefore should be set aside, and it is so ordered.<br\/><br\/>It is further ordered that the case be remanded to the lower court for such further action as may be necessary in the administration and settlement of the said estate.\u00a0 Without any finding as to costs, it is so ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C, J., Torres<\/i> and <i>Moreland, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><br\/><br\/><hr align=\"center\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/> <center style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><br\/>CONCURRING<\/center><br\/><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">CARSON, J.,<\/span><br\/><br\/>I concur in the result, not basing my conclusions, however, on the theory that the judges who took part in these proceedings were \"judges of coordinate jurisdiction acting within the same jurisdiction,\" so that the exercise of jurisdiction by one in some way limited or restricted that of the other; for it appears that the judge who issued the annulling order succeeded the judge who issued the original order as presiding judge of the court wherein the administration proceedings were pending, and therefore had precisely the same authority and jurisdiction with regard to those proceedings as his predecessor would have had, in the event that he had continued as presiding judge until the motion praying the issuance of the annulling order was submitted.<br\/><br\/>The revocation by this court\u00a0 of the annulling order in the court below rests strictly, in my opinion, upon the proposition that, upon the facts set out in the majority opinion, neither the judge who actually issued the annulling order nor the judge who issued the original order, had he continued as presiding judge of the court wherein the proceedings were pending until the motion for the issuance of the annulling order was submitted, had lawful authority to issue the annulling order at the time and under the circumstances existing when it was in fact issued.<br\/><\/div>",

Plaintiffs, in their reply of the 20th day of December, 1904, made the following statement:<br\/><blockquote>\"<i>Freight<\/i>.-I received the note you sent me on this subject.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We will go carefully into the matter and will let you know the result and what reductions we can make-'\"\u00a0 <\/blockquote>and they afterwards reduced the freight to 30 cents a sack.<br\/><br\/>We find nothing in this letter, nor in any other part of the proof, which indicates a promise on the part of the plaintiffs to refund to the defendant 10 cents a sack for the rice already transported.\u00a0 By the letter, they simply promised that they would study the matter and would advise him if they could make any reduction.\u00a0 The evidence introduced by the. defendant to show that 30 cents a sack was charged to other persons at the same time is not controlling.\u00a0 In one case it was by virtue of an express contract, and there was evidence also that the landing and discharge of cargoes at Bato, where the defendant's business was established, was more difficult than at other places in the Islands to which a lower rate was made.\u00a0 The judgment of the court below in favor of the plaintiffs in respect to this objection must be affirmed.<br\/><br\/>The ninth objection relates to the change, on the 30th of June, 1904, of the account of the plaintiffs from Mexican money to Philippine money. This change was made at the rate of 1 peso and 4 cents, Mexican money, for 1 peso, Philippine money.\u00a0 The defendant claims that it should have been made at the rate of 1 peso and 10 cents, Mexican money, for 1 peso, Philippine money.\u00a0 No evidence was introduced by him to show what the actual relative value of the two moneys was on the 30th day of June, 1904.\u00a0 Evidence was introduced to show that prior to and after that date transactions were had between the parties at a different rate, but this is by no means conclusive as to the value on that particular day, because, as it is well known, the value of Mexican money fluctuated greatly at that time.\u00a0 It appears, moreover, that the personal accounts of the members of the plaintiff firm were transferred at the same time from Mexican money to Philippine money and at the same rate of 1 peso and 4 cents, Mexican money, for 1 peso, Philippine money.\u00a0 But the chief reason for not allowing this objection is found, as stated by the court below, in the fact that on the 4th day of August the plaintiffs advised the defendant that they had changed the accounts from one kind of money to the other, at the rate above named.\u00a0 To the letter containing this statement and others relating to the law then in force concerning the new money the defendant answered, on the 6th day of August, 1904, as follows:<br\/><blockquote><i>\"Currency<\/i>.-I am in receipt of and have carefully noted your communication with respect to the new monetary system in Conant, and the transactions in Mexican, under Act No. 1045.\u00a0 Thanks for the notification,\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It was necessary that this change should be made, and the plaintiffs having made it at a certain rate and having notified the defendant thereof it was clearly his duty to object to the rate if he was not satisfied with it.\u00a0 As is seen, he made no objection whatever at the time, and as far as appears never made any objection until he filed his answer herein.\u00a0 The evidence is sufficient to show that he assented to the rate at which the change was made.\u00a0 The judgment of the court below with reference to this objection must be sustained.<br\/><br\/>Objection No. 18 relates to the same matter, and the judgment must be sustained for the same reason.<br\/><br\/>Objection No. 21 relates to the interest which the plaintiffs charged against defendant in the current account.\u00a0 There is no dispute that by agreement between the parties interest was to be charged for or against each of them at the rate of 8 per cent per annum.\u00a0 On the 30th day of June, 1904, plaintiffs charged the defendant as interest P4,792.72; on the 30th of December, 1904, they charged the defendant with P3,814.55; on the 30th day of June, 1905, they charged him with P5,760.29, and on the 30th of November, 1905, with P4,824.25.\u00a0 These several items of interest were at the dates named added to the principal, and the interest was thus capitalized every six months.\u00a0 As we understand the objection of the defendant, it is that this capitalization of the interest took place every six months instead of taking place every year.\u00a0 The over-charge that would result would therefore be the interest on P4,792.72 from the 30th of June, 1904, to the 31st of December, 1904, and on P5,760.29 from the 30th of June, 1905, to the 31st of December, 1905.\u00a0 According to Exhibit W, presented by the plaintiffs, there would also be interest on P605.65 from the 30th of July, 1904, to the 31st of December, 1904. In passing upon this objection, the court below allowed the defendant P1,289.06 with reference to the accounts for the year 1904, and with reference to the accounts for the year 1905 he held that the plaintiffs were entitled to P256.40 more than they had charged, making a total allowance in favor of the defendant of about P1,000.\u00a0 This is very largely in excess of the interest for six months upon the three items which we have above mentioned, and there was no error therefore committed by the court below to the prejudice of the defendant.<br\/><br\/>In the twenty-third objection, the defendant claims that he should be allowed P240 as his commission on freight secured by him in Catanduanes for the steamers of the plaintiffs and sent from there to Manila.\u00a0 The court disallowed this claim, holding that it was included in objection No. 2, which had been allowed by it; but objection No. 2 related to the commission of the defendant upon merchandise sent from Manila to Catanduanes, while objection No. 23 related to merchandise sent from Catanduanes to Manila.\u00a0 The court below having allowed the commission claimed in objection No. 2, we think that this commission claimed in objection No. 23 should also be allowed, and that the defendant is entitled to a credit on his account of P240 and interest.\u00a0 The date from which this interest should be computed does not clearly appear, but we allow it for the year 1905, at the rate of 8 per cent, and there should be deducted from the judgment ordered by the court below, namely, P94,222.50, this amount of P259.20, leaving a balance of P93,963.30, for which judgment should be rendered, with interest thereon from the 1st day of January, 1900.<br\/><br\/>Considerable space in the appellant's brief is devoted to a discussion of the first error assigned by him, which is that the debt sued upon was not due at the time the action was commenced.\u00a0 This claim is based upon the proposition that the debt appears in a current account, and that this current account had not been liquidated by the parties prior to the commencement of the action; in other words, that until the parties had liquidated the account, and agreed upon the balance, no action could be maintained, or, if one could be maintained, it would be an action not for the recovery of money but for the liquidation of the account.\u00a0 It is very apparent that this claim can not be sustained.\u00a0 The defendant owed the plaintiffs money.\u00a0 If the parties could not agree upon the amount, the plaintiff's had a right to apply to the court, not only to determine the amount but also in the same suit to order judgment against the defendant for the amount so determined.\u00a0 That was all that was done in this case.\u00a0 Repeated demands were made upon the defendant for the payment of the balance due; these demands were refused; nothing remained for the plaintiffs except to commence an action to recover the amount which they claimed to be due.\u00a0 Of course, they could not by themselves determine conclusively what this amount was and compel the defendant to pay the amount so fixed by the plaintiffs, but they had a right to present their account to the court with their proof relating thereto.\u00a0 In this action the defendant had the right to object to any one or all of the items of the account.\u00a0 He in fact exercised that right, presenting objections to more than twenty items therein.\u00a0 These objections were all decided by the court, and the court in fact liquidated the account between the parties and found that there was a balance due from the defendant.<br\/><br\/>It is also claimed by the defendant that the plaintiffs had no right to close this account of their own motion and then bring an action for the amount due thereon.\u00a0 There is nothing in this contention. When the defendant bought the business from Rafael Molina, on the 27th of July, 1903, he agreed to pay therefor P134,636.12, in four installments.\u00a0 The first installment was paid at the date of the contract.\u00a0 The second installment became due on the 27th of July, 1904.\u00a0 This was not paid, and on the 10th of March, 1905, Rafael Molina commenced an action against De la Riva to recover it.\u00a0 That action was finally decided in this court on the 22d of March, 1900.\u00a0 (See Molina <i>vs<\/i>. De la Riva, 6 Phil. Rep., 12.)\u00a0 While this suit was pending, another installment became due, on the 27th of July, 1905.\u00a0 This was not paid.\u00a0 Molina commenced another action against the defendant for its recovery, and on the 21st of August, 1005, procured the appointment of a receiver to take charge of the entire business of De la Riva in Catanduanes.\u00a0 (See Molina <i>vs<\/i>. De la Riva, 7 Phil. Rep., 302.)<br\/><br\/>The appointment of this receiver effectually stopped the business of the defendant, and as appears from the current account practically nothing more was done between the parties to this action.\u00a0 It is very clear that this of itself closed their business relations and justified the plaintiffs in closing the account.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiffs were also justified in closing the account by reason of other acts of De la Riva.\u00a0 He was bound by his agreement with the plaintiffs to consign to them the hemp and other products of the country which he bought in Catanduanes for shipment to Manila.\u00a0 It is proven to our satisfaction by the testimony of the defendant himself, in connection with other evidence that about the month of July, 1905, he sold to persons other than the plaintiff's over 2,000 piculs of hemp, and received therefor in cash more than P60,000.\u00a0 He admitted that no entry of the receipt of this money was made in his cash book but only in the account of the capital which he had invested in the business.\u00a0 As he said, \"This money did not pass through the cash, but went directly to my pocket.\"\u00a0 One thousand one hundred piculs of this hemp were sent to Roberto Spalding in Manila, and the value thereof, amounting to nearly P50,000, was paid by Spalding to the father-in-law of the defendant.\u00a0 If the hemp thus sold by De la Riva had been remitted to the plaintiffs for sale they not only would have been entitled to a commission on the sale but would have been entitled to credit the amount received therefrom to the debt of De la Riva, which would thereby have been to a large extent extinguished.\u00a0 This violation by De la Riva of his contract with the plaintiffs justified the latter in closing the account.<br\/><br\/>The answer of the defendant contains a counterclaim, in which it is alleged that defendant bought the business of Molina at the instigation and request of the plaintiffs, and that the plaintiffs agreed with the defendant to pay to Molina the purchase price thereof and to furnish the defendant unlimited credit for carrying on the business in the future.\u00a0 The finding of the court below upon this counterclaim is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"The evidence shows that the plaintiffs were friends of the defendant.\u00a0 They pursuaded him not to return to Spain, and induced him to purchase the business of Rafael Molina, one of the members of the plaintiff firm acting for him as attorney in fact in the purchase.<br\/><br\/>\"It also appears that the plaintiffs assisted the defendant by extending him credit, at least to the extent of continuing the business bought by him, and they paid the first installment owing for its purchase.\u00a0 Subsequent installments were not paid when due; the plaintiffs thereupon commenced to make demands upon the defendant, the latter's property was attached, and his business brought to a close.<br\/><br\/>\"Nevertheless, it has not been shown that the plaintiffs agreed to pay for the business of Molina, or to advance the money required to carry it on, and while on the one hand it is possible that there existed a certain moral obligation on the part of the plaintiffs to continue to assist the defendant, they were under no legal obligation so to do, and in consequence the counterclaim of the defendant must also be dismissed.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>After a careful study of all the evidence relating to this counterclaim, we agree entirely with the above-quoted conclusions of the court below.\u00a0 It is very improbable that the plaintiffs ever agreed with the defendants to pay Molina the purchase price of this property.\u00a0 If they had made such agreement they would themselves have bought the property, and that agreement would undoubtedly have appeared somewhere in writing.\u00a0 That the plaintiffs did make large advances to the defendant upon the purchase by him of the business appears in the evidence.\u00a0 They paid the first installment of P33,000 due Molina at the time the contract was made, by crediting Molina with that amount upon the current account which they had with him, and charging the same amount to the defendant in his current account.\u00a0 It moreover appears that before they had received any money or other property from the defendant they had made other advances to him, to such an amount that, as De la Riva himself testified, from the beginning he owed them P60,000.<br\/><br\/>The failure to pay the second installment due Molina can not, we think, be attributed to plaintiffs.\u00a0 In the property sold by Molina to De la Riva were included claims against various persons in Catanduanes, amounting to a large sum.\u00a0 Prior to the time when the second installment became due the defendant had notified the plaintiffs that some of these claims could not be collected, and in view of the fact that Molina in the contract had guaranteed their payment he insisted that the amount of the uncollectible debts, which, as he afterwards stated in a counterclaim presented against Molina reached the sum of P72,000, should be deducted from the price.\u00a0 Molina's agent was notified of this claim and refused to admit it.\u00a0 No agreement could be reached between the parties, and Molina commenced his second action, as has been stated, in August, 1905.\u00a0 It is true that the defendant testified that he repeatedly asked the plaintiffs to pay this second installment, but the documentary evidence indicates that he insisted upon some allowance by reason of the uncollectible debts.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below is modified, by changing the amount thereof, to wit, P94,222.50, to P93,963.30, and with this modification it is affirmed and judgment ordered against the defendant for P93,963.30, with interest thereon from the 1st of January, 1906, at 8 per cent per annum, and the costs of the First Instance.\u00a0 No costs will be allowed to either party in this court.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano C, J., Torres, Johnson<\/i>, and <i>Tracey, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><br\/><br\/><hr align=\"center\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><br\/><br\/>CARSON, J., with whom concurs MAPA, J., dissenting:<br\/><br\/>I dissent.<br\/><br\/>I agree with the majority as to the disposition of the various contentions of the appellant, except as to the affirmation of the finding of the court below touching the rate of exchange from Mexican to Philippine currency, at which the plaintiff, on July 31,1904, converted the alleged balance due on account, and at which various bills of exchange mentioned in claim No. 18 were thereafter entered in the account stated.<br\/><br\/>Defendant having denied the allegations of plaintiff as to the market rate of exchange at the time when these entries were made, the burden of proof as to the fact undoubtedly fell upon the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>There does not appear to be any evidence in the record upon which a finding as to the true market rate of exchange at the dates indicated can be predicated, but it does appear that the official rate was $1.13, Mexican currency, for P1, Philippine currency, and that a short time before and a few days after the conversion of the balance at the rate of Pl.04, Mexican, for P1, Philippine currency, the plaintiff company made other exchanges at the rate of $1.10, Mexican, for P1, Philippine currency.<br\/><br\/>The loss to defendant and the gain to the plaintiff company by making the exchange at the rate of $1.04, Mexican, rather than $1.10, Mexican, for Pl, Philippine currency, amounts to many thousands of pesos, and without satisfactory proof as to true market rate of exchange, I do not think judgment should be entered in favor of the plaintiff.\u00a0 The letter relied upon by the plaintiff as evidence of the acquiescence of defendant in the entry at the rate indicated seems to me to fall far short of establishing that fact, and,is in truth no more than an acknowledgment of receipt of notification of proposed change in system of keeping the account, and in no wise an acceptance of the rate indicated, should it afterwards appear to have been erroneously adopted.<br\/><br\/>The judgment should be reversed and returned to the court below for the taking of testimony as to the true rate of exchange at the time of the making of the entries under discussion.<br\/><\/div>",

MARCELO LAURON ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">On the 23d of November, 1900, Arturo Pelayo, a physician residing in Cebu, filed a complaint against Marcelo Lauron and Juana Abella setting forth that on or about the 13th of October of said year, at night, the plaintiff was called to the house of the defendants, situated in San Nicolas, and that upon arrival he was requested by them to render medical assistance to their daughter-in-law who was about to give birth to a child; that therefore, and after consultation with the attending physician, Dr. Esca\u00f1o, it was found necessary, on account of the difficult birth, to remove the foetus by means of forceps which operation was performed by the plaintiff, who also had to remove the after-birth, in which service he was occupied until the following morning, and that afterwards, on the same day, he visited the patient several times; that the just and equitable value of the services rendered by him was P500, which the defendants refuse to pay without alleging any good reason therefor; that for said reason he prayed that judgment be entered in his favor as against the defendants, or any of them, for the sum of P500 and costs, together with any other relief that might be deemed proper.<br\/><br\/>In answer to the complaint counsel for the defendants denied all of the allegations therein contained and alleged as a special defense, that their daughter-in-law had died in consequence of the said childbirth, and that when she was alive she lived with her husband independently and in a separate house without any relation whatever with them, and that, if on the day when she gave birth she was in the house of the defendants, her stay there was accidental and due to fortuitous circumstances; therefore, he prayed that the defendants be absolved of the complaint with costs against the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff demurred to the above answer, and the court below sustained the demurrer, directing the defendants, on the 23d of January, 1907, to amend their answer.<br\/><br\/>In compliance with this order the defendants presented, on the same date, their amended answer, denying each and every one of the allegations contained in the complaint, and requesting that the same be dismissed with costs.<br\/><br\/>As a result of the evidence adduced by both parties, judgment was entered by the court below on the 5th of April, 1907, whereby the defendants were absolved from the former complaint, on account of the lack of sufficient evidence to establish a right of action against the defendants, with costs against the plaintiff, who excepted to the said judgment and in addition moved for a new trial on the ground that the judgment was contrary to law; the motion was overruled and the plaintiff excepted and in due course presented the corresponding bill of exceptions.\u00a0 The motion of the defendants requesting that the declaration contained in the judgment that the defendants had demanded the professional services of the plaintiff be eliminated therefrom, for the reason that, according to the evidence, no such request had been made, was also denied, and to the decision the defendants excepted.<br\/><br\/>Assuming that it is a real fact acknowledged by the defendants, that the plaintiff, by virtue of having been sent for by the former, attended as physician and rendered professional services to a daughter-in-law of the said defendants during a difficult and laborious childbirth, in order to decide the claim of the said physician regarding the recovery of his fees, it becomes necessary to decide who is bound to pay the bill, whether the father and mother-in-law of the patient, or the husband of the latter.<br\/><br\/>According to article 1089 of the Civil Code, obligations are created by law, by contracts, by quasi-contracts, and by illicit acts and omissions or by those in which any kind of fault or negligence occurs.<br\/><br\/>Obligations arising from law are not presumed. Those expressly determined in the code or in special laws, etc., are the only demandable ones.\u00a0 Obligations arising from contracts have legal force between the contracting parties and must be fulfilled in accordance with their stipulations. (Arts, 1090 and 1091.)<br\/><br\/>The rendering of medical assistance in case of illness is comprised among the mutual obligations to which spouses are bound by way of mutual support.\u00a0 (Arts. 142 and 143.)<br\/><br\/>If every obligation consists in giving, doing, or not doing something (art. 1088), and spouses are mutually bound to support each other, there can be no question but that, when either of them by reason of illness should be in need of medical assistance, the other is under the unavoidable obligation to furnish the necessary services of a physician in order that health may be restored, and he or she may be freed from the sickness by which life is jeopardized; the party bound to furnish such support is therefore liable for all expenses, including the fees of the medical expert for his professional services.\u00a0 This liability originates from the above-cited mutual obligation which the law lias expressly established between the married couple.<br\/><br\/>In the face of the above legal precepts it is unquestionable that the person bound to pay the fees due to the plaintiff for the professional services that he rendered to the daughter-in-law of the defendants during her childbirth is the husband of the patient and not her father and mother-in-law, the defendants herein.\u00a0 The fact that it was not the husband who called the plaintiff and requested his assistance for his wife is no bar to the fulfillment of the said obligation, as the defendants, in view of the imminent danger to which the life of the patient was at that moment exposed, considered that medical assistance was urgently needed, and the obligation of the husband to furnish his wife with the indispensable services of a physician at such critical moments is specially established by the law, as has been seen, and compliance therewith is unavoidable; therefore, the plaintiff, who believes that he is entitled to recover his fees, must direct his action against the husband who is under obligation to furnish medical assistance to his lawful wife in such an emergency.<br\/><br\/>From the foregoing it may readily be understood that it was improper to have brought an action against the defendants simply because they were the parties who called the plaintiff and requested him to assist the patient during her difficult confinement, and also, possibly, because they were her father and mother-in-law and the sickness occurred in their house.\u00a0 The defendants were not, nor are they now, under any obligation by virtue of any legal provision, to pay the fees claimed, nor in consequence of any contract entered into between them and the plaintiff from which such obligation might have arisen.<br\/><br\/>In applying the provisions of the Civil Code in an action for support, the supreme court of Spain, while recognizing the validity and efficiency of a contract to furnish support wherein a person bound himself to support another who was not his relative, established the rule that the law does impose the obligation to pay for the support of a stranger, but as the liability arose out of a contract, the stipulations of the agreement must be upheld.\u00a0 (Decision of May 11, 1897.)<br\/><br\/>Within the meaning of the law, the father and mother-in-law are strangers with respect to the obligation that devolves upon the husband to provide support, among which is the furnishing of medical assistance to his wife at the time of her confinement; and, on the other hand, it does not appear that a contract existed between the defendants and the plaintiff physician, for which reason it is obvious that the former can not be compelled to pay fees which they are under no liability to pay because it does not appear that they consented to bind themselves.<br\/><br\/>The foregoing suffices to demonstrate that the first and second errors assigned to the judgment below are unfounded, because, if the plaintiff has no right of action against the defendants, it is needless to declare whether or not the use of forceps is a surgical operation.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, in view of the considerations hereinbefore set forth, it is our opinion that the judgment appealed from should be affirmed with the costs against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Mapa<\/i> and <i>Tracey, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><i>Arellano, C.

N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>MORELAND, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">This is an action brought by the plaintiff to recover damages for personal injuries caused by being shocked and burned by coming in contract with a live electric light wire, negligently placed by the defendant in one of the streets of the city of Manila.<br\/><br\/>The defendant, answering, makes a general denial and sets up as a special defense and bar to the action a release executed by the plaintiff, wherein the plaintiff, in consideration of P20 paid as damages, absolved the defendant from all further liability by reason of the negligence referred to.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff denies in his reply the execution of the release and declares the instrument to be \"a false and fraudulent document.\"<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff recovered, in the court below, a judgment for damages to the amount of P6,000, and the payment to him by the defendant of the sum of P40 per month from the 1st day of July, 1906, until the time when said sum of P6,000 should be paid by the defendant.<br\/><br\/>The defendant duly excepted to the decision and thereafter made a motion for a new trial upon all of the grounds specified in section 497 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions.\u00a0 That motion was denied by the court, and to that denial, and the order entered thereupon, the defendant duly excepted and perfected its appeal to this court.<br\/><br\/>Herein are stated only those facts affecting the execution of the release above referred to:<br\/><br\/>Some time prior to the night of the 28th of January, 1906, the defendant company had strung some electric light wires in Calle Gagalangin in the city of Manila.\u00a0 The work was so negligently done that the end of a wire, heavily charged with electricity, loosely dangled in the street within reach of persons passing.<br\/><br\/>On the night in question the plaintiff was a policeman of the city of Manila on duty in that street.\u00a0 On the morning of the 29th aforesaid, between 2 and 3 o'clock, passing along the said street in the performance of his duties, he came in contact with said wire and sustained certain burns and shocks, which, he claims, rendered him temporarily unconscious.\u00a0 Regaining his senses shortly, he made his way to the police station and was from there sent to the Civil Hospital.<br\/><br\/>On the morning of the 29th above referred to, between the hours of 7 and 9, two persons, Lopez and Van Hoven, agents and employees of the defendant company, went to the Civil Hospital, where the plaintiff then was.\u00a0 After some conversation with him, lasting about twenty minutes, they, on behalf of the company, made a compromise settlement with him, in pursuance of which he, in consideration of P20 paid him at that time, executed a release, in Spanish, of each and every one of his rights and claims to any further damages arising from such negligence.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff seeks to avoid the effect of the release referred to by claiming that its execution was procured by the false and fraudulent representations of the defendant's agents, principally in that they represented to him that the paper which they presented to him for his signature was merely and simply a receipt showing that they had given him alms or a gratuity.\u00a0 He claims that he was at the time unable to read the Spanish language and that he did not read the document, and that he relied entirely upon the representations of defendant's agents as to the contents of the paper which he signed.\u00a0 On the other hand, the agents of the defendant company assert that while they did not read the instrument in full to the plaintiff, they explained to him, in substance, its nature and purport and informed him, in particular, that it was a release of all his rights to damages arising from the negligence of the company on the occasion referred to, and a complete renunciation of any further or other claim.\u00a0 They further allege and state that, after the paper was complete in every way except the signature, they delivered it into the possession of the plaintiff, who took it and glanced over it as if he were reading it.\u00a0 It nowhere appears in the evidence that the agents at that time knew that the plaintiff could\u00a0 not read the Spanish language.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff bases his defense to the release solely upon the ground that, taking advantage of his inability to read, the agents of the defendant company perpetrated a fraud on him by false and fraudulent representations as to the contents of the paper in question.<br\/><br\/>Nowhere in the evidence is there any claim made on behalf of the plaintiff that he did not have mental capacity to understand the act which he performed.\u00a0 On the other hand, it is contended on his behalf that he thoroughly understood the nature of the act which he <i>thought<\/i> he was performing, namely, the signing of a receipt for alms.\u00a0 The claim made is that, admitting his mental capacity, the agents of the defendant company took advantage of his inability to read and foisted\u00a0 upon him a paper entirely different from the one which they stated to him they were presenting to him for his signature.<br\/><br\/>It nowhere appears that the plaintiff, at the time of the execution of the release in question, in any way indicated to the agents of the defendant company that he was in pain, or suffering convulsions, or that he was in such bodily condition as to be unable to conduct that kind of negotiation or perform that kind of a business act.<br\/><br\/>The defense made by the plaintiff to the release, namely, that of false and fraudulent representations, involves the necessity of charging the agents of the defendant company with a serious offense.\u00a0 The success of that defense, in effect, finds them guilty of the offense charged.\u00a0 It means that the agents, acting together, deliberately planned and executed an offense against the\u00a0 plaintiff which would exclude or ought to exclude them from the society of honest men.\u00a0 In fact, the act with which they are charged by the plaintiff constitutes a crime under article 535, subdivision 7, of the Penal Code, wherein it says that a man shall be guilty of a crime \"who shall commit fraud by causing another to subscribe a document by the use of deceit.\"<br\/><br\/>That defense Requires also that it shall be found, as a fact, that the two agents committed perjury.\u00a0 They both testify directly that they, or one of them, explained to the plaintiff fully and fairly the contents of the paper.\u00a0 He testifies that they did not do so.\u00a0 They both swear that they gave the paper into the hands of the plaintiff, and that he looked it over as if he were reading it.\u00a0 He testifies that they did no such thing, and that he never had the paper in his hands at all and never saw it until it was laid on the table for him to sign.\u00a0 They both testify that he was told by them, or one of them, that it was a release and a renunciation of all his rights and claims against the company.\u00a0 He swears that they told him no such thing.\u00a0 He testifies, moreover, that they told him it was merely a receipt to show that they had given him alms.\u00a0 They testify that they told him no such thing.\u00a0 They assert that when they entered his room in the hospital he was sitting in a somewhat upright position in bed.\u00a0 He testifies that he was lying down in bed at the time.\u00a0 They both testify that he told them, upon their inquiry, that his injuries were slight.\u00a0 He testifies that he never told them any such thing.\u00a0 Every important\u00a0 fact is distinctly stated by them, upon one side, and as distinctly denied by him, upon the other.\u00a0 There seems to be no possibility of reconciling the statements of the opposing parties.<br\/><br\/>The weight of the testimony, it seems to me, is strongly against the contention of the plaintiff:<br\/><br\/>First.\u00a0 The plaintiff's testimony is directly and flatly contradicted\u00a0 by the witnesses, Lopez and Van Hoven.<br\/><br\/>There seems to be no special reason for discrediting them.<br\/><br\/>(a) They were interested, to be sure, for their company, but their interest in the result of the litigation was certainly no more than that of the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>(b) They were unimpeached by any of the circumstances surrounding the transaction or in any manner more direct.<br\/><br\/>(c) Their testimony appears to be much more in harmony with the circumstances and conditions existing at the time of the execution of the release than the testimony of the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>Second.\u00a0 The circumstances are not in harmony with the plaintiff's contention:<br\/><br\/>(a) It appears\u00a0 from\u00a0 the evidence that neither of the agents was acquainted with the plaintiff at the time of the execution of the release, and that neither of them had ever seen him before.\u00a0 They could not, therefore, determine whether he was a man upon whom a fraud could be perpetrated or not.<br\/><br\/>(b) So far as the evidence goes, they did not know, at the time of the execution of the release, that he could not read the Spanish language.\u00a0 He did not tell them that he could not read.\u00a0 On the contrary, his actions indicated, so far as the testimony of the agents goes, that he was able to read.\u00a0 The absence of this knowledge would tend to rob the agents of the intention of overreaching him by reason of his illiteracy.\u00a0 They did not know\u00a0 but what he could easily detect at any time the falsity of their representations by simply reading the paper.<br\/><br\/>(c) They were informed before going to the hospital that the plaintiff was a policeman.\u00a0 It would naturally be presumed that, being a policeman, he was considerably above the ordinary, both in education and ability, and that he would be exceptionally well able to take care of himself and protect his own interests.\u00a0 An individual who is set up to protect the rights and the property of the public generally is presumed to have sufficient intelligence and ability to prevent a fraud being\u00a0 perpetrated against himself particularly a fraud so easy of detection as was the one which he alleges they perpetrated against him.<br\/><br\/>(d) There was no secrecy maintained by the agents in consummating the transaction.\u00a0 There were other beds containing patients in the same room and near to that of the plaintiff.\u00a0 The attendant was about the bed at various times and generally not far from the scene of the transaction.\u00a0 The doctor himself was there a part of the time.<br\/><br\/>(e) Calling in the policeman, Holmes, whom neither of the agents knew or had ever seen before, indicates that the agents were acting honestly and fairly and had no fear of being caught in the perpetration of a fraudulent act or the commission of a crime.\u00a0 Holmes was a brother-policeman of the plaintiff.\u00a0 They were doing duty on the same force.\u00a0 The duty of each and of both was, among other things, to prevent the perpetration of frauds, either upon themselves or upon others.\u00a0 Holmes was an American.\u00a0 He easily understood the nature of the transaction.\u00a0 There is no question but what he understood it thoroughly.\u00a0 He would doubtless have detected instantly any attempt on the part of the agents to defraud the plaintiff.\u00a0 All this the agents of the defendant well knew.\u00a0 Yet they did not hesitate\u00a0 to call him.\u00a0 It is hardly reasonable to asume that the two agents, engaged in the commission of a fraud against one policeman, would call in another policeman to assist them in the consummation of that fraud.<br\/><br\/>The calling in of Holmes induces, almost necessarily, the presumption that the transaction with the plaintiff was open and fair in every particular.<br\/><br\/>The policeman, Holmes, was called in by the agents, so says the plaintiff, for the purpose of explaining to the plaintiff that the money which was being given him was not a bribe.\u00a0 Evidently the policeman could not have known whether it was a bribe or not until\u00a0 he knew why or for what purpose it was given.\u00a0 It is equally evident that the policeman would not have been able to convince the plaintiff that it was not a bribe except he explained to him what it really was, or unless the plaintiff accepted Holmes' knowledge and judgment as his own.\u00a0 The policeman testifies that he saw the heading of the paper and recognized it is a renunciation, general and special.\u00a0 Van Hoven testifies that he told Holmes the nature of the whole transaction and that Holmes saw the paper.\u00a0 This is not disputed,.\u00a0 With all this knowledge Holmes gave his explanation to the plaintiff.\u00a0 After the explanation so given, the plaintiff signed the paper.\u00a0 The\u00a0 plaintiff either himself knew the nature and purport of the paper fully or else he accepted the knowledge of the policeman Holmes in place of his own.\u00a0 That Holmes knew what the transaction was is undisputed.\u00a0 That Holmes made known to the plaintiff the nature of the transaction is almost an inevitable conclusion.\u00a0 At least, having accepted Holmes' knowledge in place of his own, a man perfectly fair and impartial between the parties to the transaction, his rights must be very clear if he now be permitted to repudiate the transaction by reason of lack of knowledge on the\u00a0 part of himself.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff, then, in order to establish the fraud, must not only convince us that he himself was imposed upon and overreached, but that Holmes, also, was deceived, hoodwinked, and cheated.\u00a0 But from the undisputed testimony it appears that Holmes knew perfectly the nature and purpose of the transaction.<br\/><br\/>(f) The paper was headed in large letters \"Renuncia General y Especial.\"\u00a0 The plaintiff uses the Spanish script in writing his name to the document and to the papers filed in the case.\u00a0 He also speaks Spanish.\u00a0 It would seem as if he ought to have recognized the words \"Renuncia General y Especial\" at the top of the paper and to have known their import sufficiently to have put him on his guard at least.<br\/><br\/>Third.\u00a0 The evidence of the plaintiff himself is contradictory in important particulars:<br\/><br\/>(a) The plaintiff claims that he signed the paper in question upon the request and the representations of the defendant's agents because he did not believe that the American would do him an injury.\u00a0 The good faith thus asserted in the agent of the company is entirely at variance with the previous refusal to accept the representations of the defendant's agents that the sum to\u00a0 be paid him was not a bribe.<br\/><br\/>(b) It is not at all reasonable to believe that the plaintiff could have regarded the sum of money paid him by the defendant as a pure gift or gratuity.\u00a0 He states in his testimony that he knew Lopez and Van Hoven to be the agents of the defendant company because they told\u00a0 him so, and that he took the money from them because they represented the company, and he would not have taken it if they had not represented the company.\u00a0 The defendant was either liable or not liable to the plaintiff in damages for the injuries he had sustained.\u00a0 If the company was liable to the plaintiff, then his remaining in the hospital and his loss of time, etc., would be at least a part of the damages which the defendant would be obliged to pay him.\u00a0 The plaintiff is presumed to know his legal rights.\u00a0 There is not the least evidence or claim that he did not now them.\u00a0 He knew he had been injured by the company; he knew these two men were the agents of the company;\u00a0 he knew that the company must pay him damages; and he knew that at least a part of those damages would be his stay in the hospital, his loss of time, etc.\u00a0 It is unreasonable to say that under these circumstances the plaintiff could have regarded the P20 as a charity or gratuity, for, if the defendant had paid the same as a gift, it would have been obliged later, at the suit of the plaintiff, to have paid it again as damages.\u00a0 At the time of this transaction at the hospital, in other words, the defendant owed the plaintiff a debt arising from injuries caused by its negligence.\u00a0 On that occasion it paid the plaintiff money in connection with, and because of, that debt.\u00a0 It is not reasonable to believe that the plaintiff supposed that the payment so made, under those conditions, was a gift or gratuity.\u00a0 The plaintiff himself testifies that the money was paid by the company, and in connection with the injuries which the company had inflicted upon him.<br\/><br\/>(c) The plaintiff calls the payment a gift or charity, yet his description of it sets forth a thing quite different.\u00a0 In his testimony he describes an indemnity but calls it a <i>limosna<\/i>.\u00a0 He testifies concerning the payment of the P20 to him by the agents of the defendant as follows:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"We give you this as alms, because we are from the company, for the time you are here in the hospital.<br\/><br\/>\"They said only that it was alms for being in the hospital.<br\/><br\/>\"What they read in the hospital they did not tell me was a release but a kind of receipt.<br\/><br\/>\"They told me it was a document saying that they had given me alms.<br\/><br\/>\"They told me that that document was a receipt to prove that they had given me alms.<br\/><br\/>\"They said to me 'we give you this sum [P10] as alms, because\u00a0 we are from the electric company, for the time you are in the hospital.'\u00a0 I would not take it and then they offered me P20, saying it was for the stay if I was twenty days in the hospital, in payment of vacation I should lose.\" <\/blockquote><br\/>It is thus apparent, from the plaintiff's language, that the P20 was paid him in\u00a0 consideration of something which he describes as being his stay in the hospital and his loss of vacation, and so forth.\u00a0 It was, therefore, not a gift, and the transaction, according to plaintiff's own testimony, does not constitute a gift\u00a0 but a contract, with consideration passing between them.<br\/><br\/>In this connection it is of interest to note that the plaintiff refused the offer of P10 and finally accepted P20.\u00a0 It is very rare indeed that a pure gift is doubled in size after the donee refuses the gift because it is too small or is a bribe, or both.<br\/><br\/>If plaintiff's injuries were mentioned at all during the transaction in question, they were described as very slight, according to the testimony of the defendant's agents.\u00a0 No testimony is given anywhere in the case describing plaintiff's injuries at the time the transaction referred to took place.\u00a0 Doctor Cook mentions them in his testimony only incidentally, saying that the plaintiff came to the hospital suffering from burns caused by an electric-light wire.\u00a0 It was evidently not thought by anyone at that time that plaintiff's injuries, in themselves, were in any wise serious.\u00a0 The attendant said that he would be in the hospital only\u00a0 about four days.\u00a0 So far as it appears in the evidence, none of the burns was serious enough to be dressed except those on the right hand, and they were not bad enough to prevent his using that hand when he signed the document. If the testimony of the agents is to be believed, the plaintiff, when they arrived, was sitting up in bed, and when they asked him about his injuries, he replied that they were a very simple matter,<br\/><br\/>(d) The policeman, Holmes, understood what the paper was and what the P20 was for, and it is evident that he believed the plaintiff understood it also for Holmes testifies, and this is significant to note, that during his conversation with the plaintiff, he said to the plaintiff, \"How much are you going to get?,\" and the plaintiff answered, \"Twenty pesos.\"\u00a0 \"Then,\" testifies the policeman, \"I signed and he took the money.\"<br\/><br\/>This testimony is inconsistent with the theory that the P20 was a gift.\u00a0 It shows, rather, a transaction where the amount paid and received is as much within the control of the one as the other of the parties.\u00a0 That form of expression is one not usually employed where the transaction is a purely charitable one, especially in the presence of the parties to the charity.\u00a0 It is used rather in those cases where each one of the parties has something to say as to how much or how little shall be paid.<br\/><br\/>(e) The plaintiff testifies that he signed the paper, without reading it, upon the representations of the agents because he did not believe the American would do him an injury.\u00a0 This statement from the plaintiff indicates forcibly that he was mentally acute, active, and vigilant.\u00a0 Nevertheless it also appears in plaintiff's testimony that up to that time he had steadily refused to have any confidence in what the American said upon the subject of the payment being a bribe.<br\/><br\/>Fourth.\u00a0 It is contended, and perhaps justly, that the great point in favor of plaintiff's contention is the apparent inadequacy of the consideration which he received for signing the release.<br\/><br\/>It must not be forgotten, however, that whether or not the consideration was adequate must be determined by the conditions existing at the time the release was made.\u00a0 At that time the damages to the plaintiff's person were, to all appearances, purely temporary and not at all serious;<br\/><br\/>(a) The attendant told Van Hoven that the plaintiff would not be in the hospital more than four days.<br\/><br\/>(b) Only one of his injuries, so far as the proof goes, was of sufficient consequence to require dressing, namely, that on the right hand, and this injury, dressing and all, was not sufficient to prevent the plaintiff from using that hand in signing the release.<br\/><br\/>(c) The injuries of the plaintiff were not of sufficient seriousness to induce him to comment upon them to the agents at the time, or to anybody else.\u00a0 Van Hoven testifies that the plaintiff said, in response to a question, that his injuries were only a little thing.\u00a0 So far as the proof goes, the plaintiff showed no signs of being in\u00a0 pain, or of being in a nervous or excited condition, and evidenced no lack of mental acumen or activity.\u00a0 On the contrary, he demonstrated that he was very capable of protecting himself by refusing to be drawn into any transaction where there might be the remotest possibility of his breaking any of the rules or regulations of the police department, or of disobeying any of the orders of his chief.\u00a0 In other words, he showed mental and physical power and persistence in refusing to do a thing that he did not want to do and in refusing also to do a thing which might affect adversely his personal interests.<br\/><br\/>In the case of Morris <i>vs.<\/i> Talcott (96 N. Y., 100), the court said (p. 107) :<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"The fraud charged against the defendant herein is of the nature of a crime, and can\u00a0 not be presumed, but must be established by evidence.\u00a0 * * *<br\/><br\/>\"A party, therefore, relying upon the establishment of a cause of action, or a right to a remedy against another, based upon the alleged commission of a fraud by such person, must show affirmatively facts and circumstances necessarily tending to establish a probability of guilt, in order to maintain his claim.<br\/><br\/>\"The presumption that the written instrument was carefully and deliberately prepared and executed is indulged in all cases, and the plaintiff is entitled to relief on the ground of mistake only upon clear, strong, and convincing evidence, for the writing should be deemed the sole expositor of the intent of the parties until the contrary is established beyond reasonable controversy.\"\u00a0 (Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, Vol. 21, p. 1101, and cases there cited.) <\/blockquote> <br\/>In the case of the United States <i>vs.<\/i> The Iron Silver Mining Company (128 U. S.( 673), the court says (p. 676):<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"Misrepresentation knowingly made as to these matters by the applicant for a patent will afterwards justify the government in proceeding to set it aside.\u00a0 The government has the same right to\u00a0 demand a cancellation of the conveyances of the United States when\u00a0 obtained by false and fraudulent representations as a private individual when a conveyance of his lands is obtained in like manner.\u00a0 In this respect, the United States, as a landed proprietor, stand upon the same footing with the private citizen.\u00a0 The burden of proof in such cases is upon the government.\u00a0 The presumption attending the patent, even when directly assailed, that it was issued upon sufficient evidence that the law had been complied with by the officers of the government charged with the alienation of public lands, can only be overcome by clear and convincing proof.\" <\/blockquote><br\/>\u00a0In the Maxwell Land-Grant Case (121 U. S., 325, 379, 381), the court says:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"It thus appears that the title of the defendants rests upon the strongest presumptions of fact, which, although they may be rebutted, nevertheless, can be overthrown only by full proofs to the contrary, clear, convincing and unambiguous.\" <\/blockquote><br\/>In the case of the Simmons Creek Coal Company <i>vs.<\/i> Boran (142 U. S., 417), the court says (p. 435):<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"The jurisdiction of equity to reform written instruments, when there is a mutual mistake, or mistake on one side and fraud or inequitable conduct on the other is undoubted; but to justify such reformation the evidence must be sufficiently cogent to thoroughly satisfy the mind of the court.\"\u00a0 Griswold <i>vs.<\/i> Hazard (26 Fed. Rep., 135, 138).<br\/><br\/>\"The validity and fulfillment of contracts can not be left to the will of one of the contracting parties.\"\u00a0 (Civil Code, art. 1256.) <\/blockquote> Taylors.\u00a0 Fleckenstein (30 Fed, Rep., 99,103); Grace <i>vs.<\/i> Adams, (97 Am.

and directing further that, in the event of the failure of Mas so to do, judgment be entered against him for the\u00a0 sum of P10,973.43, together with interest thereon at the rate of 6 per cent per annum on P10,514.14 thereof, from September 26, 1904, and on P459.29, from October 18, 1906, and against his sureties, Fridolin Wigett and Felipe Calderon, and each of them, for the sum of Pl0,000.\u00a0 From this order Wigett appealed, and the action of the trial court in this regard is now before us for review on his bill of exceptions duly signed and certified, to which no objection has been entered either as to form or content.<br\/><br\/>It appears that the defendant, Jose Mas, was duly appointed administrator of the estate of Francisca Hilario, deceased, and that his codefendants, Fridolin Wigett and Felipe Calderon, are sureties upon a bond for the sum of P2,000, which he executed when he qualified as such administrator on the 25th day of February, 1901, and upon a second bond, executed on the 2d of September, 1903, amplifying the original bond from P2,000 to P10,000; that Mas continued to act as administrator until the 19th day of September, 1904, when he was relieved by an order of the Court of First Instance, and Roberto Moreno, who still continues to act as administrator was appointed in his place; that on the 26th day of September, 1904, the then trial judge ordered Felipe Calderon, who was acting as legal adviser to the administrator Mas, to deposit in court the sum of P10,514.14 before the 3d day of October, 1904, on the ground that this amount paid\u00a0 over to him by the administrator was being unlawfully detained by him; that Calderon duly excepted to this order and declined to pay over the funds as ordered, claiming that the estate was indebted to him in an amount equal to all the funds belonging thereto in his possession, by way of fees for services rendered as legal adviser, and for certain alleged advances made on behalf of the estate; that on the 3d day of October, 1904, the trial cour,t issued another order, wherein, after reciting the terms of the order of September 26, 1904, and setting out the failure of Calderon to comply therewith, his conduct in that regard was adjudged to be a contempt, for which he was sentenced to imprisonment for six months or until he complied with the terms of the previous order; that to this order Calderon duly excepted and later perfected an appeal to this court; that on the 16th of October, 1906, while Calderon's appeal was still pending, the new administrator, Moreno, and the heirs of the estate filed a petition praying that the former administrator, Mas, and his bondsmen, be required to pay over certain funds of the estate which they alleged that Mas unlawfully retained in his hands; that on the 15th day of May, 1907, the above set out order was entered, directing Mas to deposit in court or to pay over to the new administrator the sum of P10,973.43 with interest, prior to June 1, 1907, and that, in the event of his failure so to do, judgment be entered against him and against the sureties on his bond, and that at that time Calderon's appeal was still undetermined.\u00a0 It further\u00a0 appears that of this sum, P10,514.14 is\u00a0 the same amount which, in the earlier proceeding, the trial court found had been paid over to Calderon by Mas and was being illegally detained by Calderon; and that the defendants filed a demurrer to the petition of plaintiffs in the proceedings now under review on the ground that at that time there was another proceeding pending between the same parties for the same cause, and that upon demurrer being overruled and the order overruling it duly excepted to, they filed their answer setting out the foregoing facts in full, and again objecting to the jurisdiction of the court on the ground that the questions raised by the petition were at that time pending resolution in the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands.<br\/><br\/>No objection appears in the record based on the patent irregularities which mark the proceedings whereby this case has been brought before us, and the only error assigned by counsel for appellant is the failure of the trial court to dismiss the petition, it appearing that the above-mentioned appeal by the defendant Calderon from another order entered in the course of the administration proceedings was still pending when the petition was filed and when the order based thereon was entered.<br\/><br\/>Appellant relies on the express provisions of sections 91 and 92 of the Code of Civil Procedure which provide that:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"The defendant may demur to the complaint, or to the statement of any distinct cause of action therein set forth, within the time fixed by general rules of court for such pleadings when it appears\u00a0 upon the face thereof.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"That there is another action pending between the same parties for the same cause.\" and that when this fact does not appear upon the face of the complaint, the objection may be taken by answer.<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>While these sections of the code provide that the objection is to be taken\u00a0 either by demurrer or answer, the objection is, of course, the same as in the absence of code provisions, is in general in the United States and England taken advantage of by the plea in abatement known as <i>auter action pendant<\/i>, and the principles laid down by the authorities touching that plea are equally applicable to the objection when raised under the express provisions of the code.<br\/><br\/>In the case of Watson <i>vs.<\/i> Jones (80 U. S., 679), it was held that, when in courts of concurrent jurisdiction, the pendency of a suit in one is relied on to defeat a second suit in another, the proceedings in an appellate court are part of the proceedings in the first court, and orders made by it to be enforced by the\u00a0 court of primary jurisdiction are, while unexecuted, a part of the case in the first suit, which may be relied on a<i>s lis pendens<\/i> in reference to the second suit.\u00a0 So, in the case under consideration, there can be no doubt that the pendency of the former proceedings <i>on appeal<\/i> may be relied on to defeat new proceedings if it appear that they are between the same parties for the same cause.\u00a0 (Fisk <i>vs.<\/i> Atkinson, 71 Cal., 452; Althen <i>vs.<\/i> Tarbox, 48 Minn., 18.)<br\/><br\/>It is not always easy, however, to determine whether the parties and the cause in different actions or proceedings are or are not the same, but in the above-cited case (Watson <i>vs.<\/i> Jones, <i>supra<\/i>) the elementary principles which govern the availability of the plea of \"other suit pending\" were thus stated [p. 715]:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"But when the pendency of such a suit is set up to defeat another, the <i>case<\/i> must be the same.\u00a0 There must be the same parties, or at least such as represent the same interest, there must be the same rights asserted, and the same relief prayed for.\u00a0 This relief must be founded on the same facts, and the title or essential basis of the relief sought must be the same.\u00a0 The identity in these particulars should be such that if the pending case had already been disposed of, it could be pleaded in bar as a former adjudication of the same matter between the same parties.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>And in the same case it was said that the true test of the sufficiency of a plea of \"other suit pending\" in another forum was the legal efficacy of the first suit when finally disposed of, as \"the thing adjudged\" regarding the matter at issue in the second suit.\u00a0 (Cf. Haytian Republic, 154 U. S., 124; Dick <i>vs.<\/i> Gjlmer, 4 La. Ann., 520; Bischoff<i> vs.<\/i> Theurer, 8 La. Ann., 15.)<br\/><br\/>It has.also\u00a0 been held that \"the criterion by which to decide\u00a0 whether two suits are for the same cause of action is, whether the evidence, properly admitted in the one, will support the other.\" (5 Cr. C. C, 393; see 13 Wallace (U. S.), 679); that the suits must be such that the same judgment may be rendered in both (17 Pick. (Mass.), 510; 19 <i>id<\/i>., 523); that there must be no substantial difference in the relief sought (Jenkins <i>vs.<\/i> Elridge, 3 Story (U. S.), 181; Calaveras County <i>vs.<\/i> Brockway, 30 Cal., 325); that \"if the whole relief sought in the second suit is not obtainable in the first, or if the relief which may be given or the remedies available in the second suit are more\u00a0 extensive than can be attained in the first, a plea to the second suit of the pendency of the first is not good\"\u00a0 (Larter <i>vs.<\/i> Canfield, N. J., 1900, 45 Atl., 616; Gibson<i> vs.<\/i> Northwestern Land Co., 89 Wis., 49); that the rule in equity is the same as at law, namely, that the plea of a party to a suit pending can be pleaded only when all the relief sought for in the second suit is\u00a0 obtainable in the first (Parker <i>vs.<\/i> Selye, 3 N. Y. App. Div., 149; Macy <i>vs.<\/i> Childress, 2 Tenn. Ch., 23); and that, while the parties need not in all cases be precisely the same, they must be the same in person or in interest (5\u00a0 Wis., 151).<br\/><br\/>Applying any one or all of the foregoing criteria to the proceedings under consideration, it will be readily seen that the plea of \"other action pending\" was properly disregarded in the court below.<br\/><br\/>Admitting that the parties plaintiff were the same, or at least the same in interest, in both proceedings, it is clear that the parties defendant were wholly different, Calderon being the sole party defendant in the former proceedings pending on appeal, while Jose Mas, administrator, Fridolin Wigett and Calderon, are defendants in the proceedings at bar, the alleged liability therein of Calderon who was also the party defendant in the former proceeding, being merely subsidiary to and dependant on the liability of his principal, Mas.<br\/><br\/>It is clear also that the adjudication of the matters admitted on Calderon's appeal could not be pleaded in bar as an adjudication of the questions at issue in the later proceeding and that the same judgment could not in any event be rendered in both proceedings; the cases are wholly distinct; the real question at issue on Calderon's appeal was his right to take, hold, and pay himself for alleged professional services out of funds admittedly belonging to the estate, without a previous adjudication of his claim and the allowance thereof by the court; while the object of the proceedings under review was to determine the amount of the alleged liability of the administrator to the estate and of the subsidiary liability of Calderon and Wigett, the sureties on his bond as administrator.\u00a0 Not only were defenses available to Calderon which could not be set up by Mas and vice versa, but the liability of Mas as administrator might under various circumstances subsist despite the fact that the adjudication of Calderon's appeal should relieve him of liability; and on the other hand a holding on appeal that the court in the former proceeding had properly directed Calderon to pay over the funds in question not only could not bind Mas, who was not a party to that proceeding, but would not relieve Mas and his bondsmen of responsibility in the event that Calderon failed to or was unable to pay over the funds as directed; and finally it will be observed that the relief sought in the second proceeding, to wit, the fixing of the liability upon Mas, and subsidiarily upon his sureties, was more extensive than the relief which could have been obtained in the first.<br\/><br\/>Appellant lays especial stress upon the fact that the court in the former proceeding may be called upon to decide the very question submitted in the latter, to wit, whether the amount of the fees and reimbursements claimed by Calderon were reasonable and properly paid over to him by the administrator.\u00a0 It is very doubtful whether this question is placed at issue in any view which may be taken of Calderon's appeal (Escueta <i>vs.<\/i> Sy-Juilliong, 5 Phil. Rep., 405; Gonzales <i>vs.<\/i> Del Rosario, 7 Phil. Rep., 140), but, however this may be, appellant's contention is, we think, sufficiently and satisfactorily disposed of by the following citation from the decision of Buck <i>vs.<\/i> Colbath (3\u00a0 Wall., 334), where the principles which should govern in regard to the identity of the matters at issue in two suits to\u00a0 make the pendency of the one defeat the other are fully discussed<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"It is not true that a court, having obtained jurisdiction of a subject-matter of a suit and of parties before it, thereby excludes all other courts from right to adjudicate upon other matters having a very close connection with those before the first court, and, in some instances, requiring the decision of the same questions exactly.<br\/><br\/>\"In examining into the exclusive character of the jurisdiction in such cases, we must have regard to the nature of the remedies, the character of the relief sought, and the identity of the parties in the different suits.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>The order of the lower court is affirmed, with the costs against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson<\/i>, and <i>Moreland, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><\/div>",

No allegation, however, was made that the plaintiff and his wife had been legally separated, or that the wife had been given permission on the part of the husband to mortgage the property in question.<br\/><br\/>After hearing the evidence adduced, the trial court denied the prayer of the plaintiff's complaint, basing his conclusions upon the following grounds:\u00a0 (<i>a<\/i>) That the evidence did not show that the deceased Luisa Pe\u00f1a was mentally incompetent to execute the instrument sought to be annulled, and (<i>b<\/i>) that the plaintiff was not entitled to maintain the action of annulment.<br\/><br\/>The lower court based the second conclusion, to wit, that the plaintiff was not the proper party to maintain the action of annulment, upon the provisions of articles 1302,1303 and 1304 of the Civil Code.<br\/><br\/>From this decision of the lower court the plaintiff appealed, and made the following assignments of error:<br\/><blockquote>\"The Court of First Instance of Manila erred:<br\/><br\/>\"1.\u00a0 In not setting forth, in the judgment appealed from, the conclusions regarding the essential facts admitted by the writings, and the essential facts in controversy which are admitted as proven, all contrary to law.<br\/><br\/>\"2.\u00a0 In not declaring the nullity of the mortgage contract and of the document wherein such contract is set forth, as prayed in the complaint, and in rendering judgment against the appellant.<br\/><br\/>\"3.\u00a0 In denying the motion for a new trial, asked for by the plaintiff.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>With reference to the first-above assignment of error, to wit, that the facts stated in the decision of the lower court were not sufficient under the allegation of the parties to justify the conclusion that the plaintiff was not entitled to have said mortgage annulled, it appears that the decision of the court makes no finding whatever with reference to the allegation of the plaintiff that the said mortgage <i>was executed and delivered without his consent and without his knowledge.<\/i><br\/><br\/>This allegation of the plaintiff constituted the very gist of his action.\u00a0 It being admitted by the defendant that the plaintiff and the said mortgagor, Luisa Pe\u00f1a, were husband and wife, then her right to dispose of the property either conjugal or paraphernal is governed by the provisions of the Civil Code, and her right to dispose of the property whether conjugal or paraphernal does not depend upon her capacity or incapacity, but upon the will of her husband.\u00a0 If it should be considered paraphernal property; then article 1387 of the Civil Code applies and she could not alienate, encumber, or mortgage it without the permission of her husband; if it be considered conjugal property, even then she was equally forbidden by law to dispose of the same without permission of her husband.\u00a0 (Art. 1416, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>In addition to the foregoing facts upon which the lower court based its conclusions, the said decision contains the further statements which may be regarded as findings of fact.<br\/><br\/>First.\u00a0 That the said mortgage was given to obtain a loan in order to renew the liquor license, the expiration of which would have rendered her business worthless.<br\/><br\/>Second.\u00a0 That the property mortgaged, or at least a part of it, was acquired by the wife alone.<br\/><br\/>Third.\u00a0 That the. separate conduct of the business by the wife seems to have been with the knowledge of her husband, within the meaning of article 7 of the Code of Commerce.<br\/><br\/>Suppose, for the purpose of argument, that these facts be admitted as true, would they be sufficient, in addition to the facts upon which the conclusions of the lower court were based, to deny the petition of the plaintiff?<br\/><br\/>Granting that the wife had authority to carry on a private business, would this fact alone justify her in mortgaging conjugal property or paraphernal property without the consent of her husband? or granting that a part of the property used in the separate business had been acquired by the wife alone, in the absence of proof whether it had been acquired before or after marriage, would this fact be sufficient to justify her in mortgaging the same without the express consent of her husband?\u00a0 If the property had been acquired before marriage and had been brought to the marriage, it would then be paraphernal property.\u00a0 If it had been acquired after marriage, then it would be conjugal property, and in either event she would not be permitted to mortgage it, or sell it, etc., without the consent of the husband. And, moreover, suppose that, under article 7 of the Code of Commerce, it be presumed that the wife was carrying on the business with the knowledge of her husband, will the fact that she has authority to conduct a private business under said article by presumption be sufficient to justify her in mortgaging the property used in such private business?\u00a0 We think not, in view of the provisions of the Civil Code which absolutely prohibit her from selling or mortgaging, etc., either the paraphernal or the conjugal property.\u00a0 We do not believe that the power which is expressly forbidden by the law can be given by mere presumption in the absence of an express provision of the law to that effect.\u00a0 The only exception to the absolute prohibition on the part of the wife to create liens against the paraphernal and conjugal property is that found in article 1408 of the Civil Code.\u00a0 The present case is not one of the exceptions mentioned in that article.<br\/><br\/>The evidence adduced during the trial in the lower court is not before us.\u00a0 Section 133 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions makes it necessary for the trial court to make a finding of the facts upon which he bases his conclusions.\u00a0 The parties have a right to know upon what facts the court bases its conclusions. (Braga <i>vs.<\/i> Millora, 8 Phil. Rep., 458; Early <i>vs.<\/i> Sy-Giang, 4 Phil. Rep., 727; City of Manila <i>vs.<\/i> Insular Government, 9 Phil. Rep., 71.)\u00a0 Not only have the parties litigant a right to know what were the facts upon which the judge based his conclusions, but they also have a right to have the questions submitted decided.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff alleged that the property in question had been mortgaged by his wife without his knowledge or consent.\u00a0 This allegation constituted the very basis of his right to have the mortgage annulled.\u00a0 If any fact existed in the proof or in the record which showed either that he had given his consent, either expressly or impliedly, or that circumstances existed which gave the wife the right to mortgage such property without his consent, these facts should have been made to appear in the decision.\u00a0 If proof had been adduced during the trial in the lower court showing circumstances which relieved the wife of the necessity of obtaining the permission of her husband to mortgage the property in question, the appellee was entitled to bring the proof to this court under an exception to the judgment of the court below for the purpose of demonstrating that fact.<br\/><br\/>We make no finding upon the question presented by the appellee, to wit, that the plaintiff had no authority to bring an action in one capacity against himself and others in another capacity for the reason that the defendant did not appeal and that question is not presented here.<br\/><br\/>From a careful examination of the facts stated in the decision, it is clearly demonstrated that such facts are not sufficient to justify the conclusion that the plaintiff is not entitled to have the mortgage in question annulled.\u00a0 The facts contained in the decision are not decisive of the question of the issue presented by the plaintiff and accepted by the defendant.\u00a0 All of the facts stated in the decision might well be admitted by the plaintiff, and yet he would be entitled to have the said mortgage annulled.<br\/><br\/>For all of the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the lower court is hereby reversed and the cause is hereby remanded to the lower court with directions that a new trial be ordered, and without any special finding as to costs, it is so ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

In that it was not held in the judgment that the children of the late Moises Ramirez, of both the first and the second marriage, had become owners in common of the two fish ponds in question by reason of the death of their ancestor.<br\/><br\/>II. In that it was found therein that, without a partition having been made of the property left by Moises Ramirez, the children of his first marriage could not validly have transmitted their rights of partition in common to the property which is the subject of this suit.<br\/><br\/>III. In that the sale of the thirteen-sixteenths of the two parcels of land in question was not declared valid, and void only as to three-sixteenths thereof.<br\/><br\/>IV. In that it was not found that, as a result of the evidence, the plaintiff had no legal capacity to bring suit.<br\/><br\/>The appeal having been heard and the evidence reviewed, the following facts must be held to have been proven:<br\/><br\/>That Moises Ramirez was first married to Apolinaria Guillermo and by her had the above-mentioned five children, Rosa, Carmen, Francisco, Mauricia, and Ignacia Ramirez.<br\/><br\/>That by his second wife, Alejandra Capistrano, he had three children, as already stated, named Cirila, Isabel, and Serapio Ramirez.<br\/><br\/>That Moises Ramirez and his two wives are now dead, as are also the two children of the second marriage, Cirila and Serapio.\u00a0 Isabel, a girl of about eight years of age, alone survives.<br\/><br\/>That the two fish ponds in question were acquired by Moises Ramirez during the time of his first marriage with Apolinaria Guillermo, on the 7th of March, 1895, which is the date of the title by composition with the Spanish Government that constitutes his title of ownership.<br\/><br\/>On this supposition, the two fish ponds in litigation belonged to the conjugal partnership between Moises Ramirez and Apolinaria Guillermo.\u00a0 (Civil Code, art. 1401, par. 1.)<br\/><br\/>By virtue of the conjugal partnership, these two fish ponds belonged half to the husband and half to the wife upon the dissolution of the marriage by reason of the death of either of them.\u00a0 (Civil Code, art. 1392.)<br\/><br\/>Consequently, upon the death of Apolinaria Guillermo one-half of the fish ponds belonged to Moises Ramirez, and the other half, that belonging to Apolinaria Guillermo, to the children of the said married couple, Rosa, Carmen, Francisco, Mauricia, and Ignacia, as the lawful heirs of their mother.\u00a0 (Civil Code, art. 931.)<br\/><br\/>Inasmuch as the said property continued undivided between the father on the one hand and the children on the other, and as the conjugal partnership had terminated, a community of property maintained the father and the children in the joint dominion.\u00a0 (Civil Code, art. 392.)<br\/><br\/>By the second marriage three additional children survived the father, and upon his death the first five children, together with the latter three, became his heirs, and all are entitled to divide the said half share belonging to their father into eight parts.<br\/><br\/>By the death of two of these last three children, their respective shares fell to Isabel as their sole heir, inasmuch as they were children of the same parents.\u00a0 (Civil Code, art. 947.)<br\/><br\/>In view of these considerations, the claim of the appellants is entirely legal that thirteen-sixteenths should be apportioned among the children of the first marriage-to wit, eight as their own, already inherited from their mother, Apolinaria Guillermo, and five subsequently inherited from their deceased father, Moises Ramirez\u2014and three-sixteenths should be the share of the three children of the second marriage, which accrued to Isabel Ramirez.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, in the succession of Moises Ramirez that is now opened the whole of these fractional parts can not be included, but only the eight which actually constitute his share in the community of property maintained by him with his children of the first marriage, Rosa, Carmen, Francisco, Mauricia, and Ignacia, since the death of his first wife.<br\/><br\/>The above five children of the first marriage, upon the death of Moises Ramirez, continued the aforesaid community of property with their three half sisters and brother, Cirila, Isabel, and Serapio; that is to say, now with Isabel, their share being thirteen-sixteenths, and that of Isabel three-sixteenths.<br\/><br\/>The present status of the two fish ponds in question is that of community of property.<br\/><br\/>\"It is certain that when two or more heirs appear at the opening of a testamentary succession, or during the progress of the settlement of an intestate estate, and each turns out to be an owner <i>pro indiviso<\/i> of the inheritance, by reason of the share he may be entitled to receive, a community of property then exists between the participants as long as the estate remains undivided *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 and nothing more tangible can be imagined than this necessary community, which arose at the moment when the coheirs assumed the entire representation of the person of the deceased with respect to all of his property, rights, and actions,\u00a0 both active and passive.\"\u00a0 (3 Manresa, 357.)<br\/><br\/>With regard to the community of property the Civil Code provides that\u2014<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"Every coowner shall have full ownership of his part and in the fruits and benefits derived therefrom, and he therefore may alienate, assign, or mortgage it, and even substitute another person\u00a0 in its enjoyment, unless personal rights are in question.\u00a0 But the effect of the alienation or mortgage, with regard to the coowners, shall be limited to the share which may be awarded him in the division on the dissolution of the community.\"\u00a0 (Art. 399, Civil Code.)<\/blockquote><br\/>If Rosa, Carmen, Francisco, Mauricia, and Ignacia Ramirez could lawfully alienate their respective shares in the joint ownership of the two parcels of land sold to the defendants, Simeon Bautista and Raymundo Duran, it is evident that the sale of thirteen-sixteenths of the said two lands could not be void; the sale of the three-sixteenths which belonged to Isabel alone is illegal, as alleged in the third assignment of error.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, the sale described in the public instrument of the 29th of November, 1901, of the thirteen-sixteenths of the lands belonging to the vendors is valid, and that of the three-sixteenths which pertain to Isabel, who neither by herself nor by means of another took part in said sale, is null.<br\/><br\/>Simeon Bautista and Raymundo Duran succeed to the vendors and are subrogated thereto in the joint ownership of the two fish ponds sold; their shares are the same that were owned by the vendors, that is, thirteen-sixteenths.<br\/><br\/>The whole of the two fish ponds can not pertain to the intestate estate of Moises Ramirez, but merely the half that belonged to him and which at his death became a part of his intestate estate.<br\/><br\/>Intestate succession can not disturb the lawful holder in his possession of property, which it is thought should constitute a part of the hereditary property.<br\/><br\/>Only in the event of a division of the common property, or upon dissolution of the community of property now existing between the purchasers, Simeon Bautista and Raymundo Duran, on the one hand and Isabel Ramirez on the other, can the fruits, rents, of benefits received, and the part thereof, as well as of the expenses, corresponding to the coowner Isabel Ramirez in maintaining the community, be considered, as well as of the rights and actions that may pertain to the purchasers as against the vendors (who have taken no part in these proceedings), by reason of the total consideration paid for the two properties, and other obligations which may have arisen because of the sale.<br\/><br\/>The present cause of action and the complaint based thereon being limited to the recovery of the two properties in question, and the restitution of the possession thereof to the administrator of the intestate estate of Moises Ramirez, in consequence of the latter's hereditary succession, it is evident that neither the recovery of possession nor the restitution asked for can be granted, as the\u00a0 defendants are the legitimate proprietors and possessors in joint ownership of the greater portion of the common property claimed.<br\/><br\/>While the question of the nullity of the entire sale was previously raised in the action, the illegality of the sale of the three-sixteenths of the common property made by the vendors is evident.<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing, it is our opinion that the judgment appealed from should only be affirmed in so far as it declares that the sale\u00a0 made by Rosa, Carmen, Francisco, Mauricia, and Ignacia Ramirez of the three-sixteenths parts belonging to Isabel Ramirez\u00a0 in the two fish ponds claimed is null and void; in all other respects the said judgment is hereby reversed, without any special ruling\u00a0 as to the costs of both instances.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson<\/i>, and <i>Moreland, JJ<\/i>. concur.<\/div>",

On the same day the defendant was arrested and brought before the court and presented a bond for his appearance. <p>On the 24th day of August, the defendant presented a motion asking for a bill of particulars, which motion was denied by the court on the 28th day of August, to which ruling of the court the defendant duly excepted.<\/p> <p>On the 30th day of August, the defendant presented a demurrer to said complaint, which demurrer was overruled by the court.<\/p> <p>On the 5th day of September, 1906, the defendant was duly arraigned and pleaded \"not guilty,\" and the cause was duly set down for trial on the 15th day of October, 1906. The trial of the cause was actually begun on the 23d day of October, 1906.<\/p> <p>On the 25th day of October, 1906, the prosecuting attorney of the city of Manila, after having obtained permission of the court, filed an amended complaint in said cause, which complaint was signed and sworn to by V. Singson Encarnacion. The amended complaint was as follows:<\/p> <blockquote> <p>\"The undersigned accuses Julio Bustos of the crime of libel, committed as follows:<\/p> <p>\"That on or about the 21st day of March, 1906, in the city of Manila, Philippine Islands, the said Julio Bustos did willfully, unlawfully, feloniously, with malicious intent to injure and disgrace Vicente Singson Encarnacion, who was then and there the provincial fiscal of the Province of Ilocos Sur, Philippine Islands, and Dionisio Chanco, who was then and there judge of the Court of First Instance for the Second Judicial District of the Philippine Islands, write and publish, and procure to be written and published, a certain false, scandalous, malicious, defamatory, and injurious publication, defamation and libel of and concerning the said Vicente Singson Encarnacion and the said Dionisio Chanco, in one part of which libel there were and are contained, amongst other things, certain false, scandalous, malicious, defamatory, and injurious matters and things of and concerning the said Vicente Singson Encarnacion and the said Dionisio Chanco, according to the tenor and effect following, that is to say:<\/p> <p>\"'(<em>c<\/em>) Away back in 1904, a horrible murder perpetrated in the presence of many persons, and which produced general indignation among all the people of the town, took place in the municipality of Narvacan, Province of Ilocos Sur. The justice of the peace of that municipality made the proper preliminary examination in which all of the eyewitnesses to the crime testified, their testimony constituting conclusive proof. In view of this fact the justice of the peace found the accused guilty and bound him over for trial in the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Sur where the case was registered as No. 90. The fiscal, Don Vicente Singson, without bringing information asked for the dismissal of the said case, and the same was dismissed, much to the surprise of all persons who had a knowledge of the facts.<\/p> <p>\"'There are rumors current in Vigan, which I have heard from many persons, that the accused in the said cause No. 90 won over the fiscal, Se\u00f1or Vicente, Judge Chanco, and the clerk of the court, Se\u00f1or Alviar, with the sum of P6,000 which was delivered to the said clerk who distributed it among the three.<\/p> <p>\"'(<em>d<\/em>) These rumors are confirmed by others with reference to the clerk of the court, Alviar, for it is said that when he was removed from office, the authority removing him recommended to the judicial authorities of Vigan that he be prosecuted for <em>estafa<\/em>. This, however, was not done, no complaint ever having been brought up against Clerk Alviar. I have been told that the said clerk publicly stated that if Fiscal Singson and Judge Chanco should dare to prosecute him for <em>estafa<\/em> they also would be prosecuted as they had been parties to the acts committed by the said clerk,'\u2014<\/p> <p>\"tending to impeach the honesty, virtue, and reputation of the said Vicente Singson Encarnacion and the said Dionisio Chanco, and thereby expose them to public hatred, contempt, and ridicule.<\/p> <p>\"Contrary to the statute in such case made and provided.\"<\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>The defendant, after having demanded a bill of particulars and after having demurred to said complaint, upon arraignment entered the pleas of \"not guilty\" and \"former jeopardy.\"<\/p> <p>After hearing the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause the lower court found the defendant guilty of the crime charged in said complaint and sentenced him to be imprisoned in the Insular Prison of Bilibid for a period of three months and to pay a fine of P100 and the costs of the prosecution. From this sentence the defendant appealed.<\/p> <p>From the record it appears that sometime in the early part of March, 1906, the defendant sent a communication to the then honorable Secretary of Justice, Mr. Ide, which was personally delivered by the defendant to the private secretary of the said Secretary, and later by the said private secretary to Mr. Ide, which communication, among many other things, contained the statements found in paragraphs (<em>c<\/em>) and (<em>d<\/em>) of the above complaint. This communication contains many statements reflecting upon the official integrity of the judge of the Court of First Instance of the Province of Ilocos Sur, of the fiscal of said province and of the clerk of said court. In the present case, however, the prosecuting attorney relies only upon those statements found in said communication quoted as paragraphs (<em>c<\/em>) and (<em>d<\/em>).<\/p> <p>The attorney for the appellant admits that the statement made in writing to the said Secretary of Justice <em>tended to impeach the honesty, virtue, and reputation of the honorable judge and the fiscal, and under some circumstances would constitute the crime of libel. But there are present in this case certain facts which place them without the provisions of the law.<\/em><\/p> <p>The appellant bases his defense in this court upon two grounds:<\/p> <p>First. That the communication to the Secretary of Justice was a privileged communication; and<\/p> <p>Second. That it was made in good faith.<\/p> <p>The above-implied admission by the defendant relieves this court of the necessity of discussing the questions whether or not the said communication was libelous, and whether or not it was actually published.<\/p> <p>The attorney for the defendant in his brief also states that \"it [the official communication] was a duty devolving upon him [the defendant] with a fair and reasonable purpose of protecting his own interest, therefore is a privileged communication. (Sec. 9, Act No. 277.)\" The attorney in his brief continues and says:<\/p> <blockquote> <p>\"This being a privileged communication, the truth or falsity of its contents is not to be taken into consideration. However, it is to be expected that a man, laboring under normal conditions, <em>would have taken steps to satisfy his mind as to the truth or falsity of such rumors before allowing his actions to be governed by them.\"<\/em><\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>The theory of the appellant, judged by the foregoing statements, evidently is that the communication, being privileged and having been made in good faith, the truth or falsity of the statements found in it is of no importance; in other words, the contention of the appellant is that the communication belongs to a class of privileged communications, the truth or falsity of which is of no importance.<\/p> <p>Section 1 of Act No. 277 (sec. 3427 of the Compilation of the Acts of the Philippine Commission) defines libel to be \"A malicious defamation, expressed either in writing, printing, or by signs or pictures, or the like, or public theatrical exhibitions, tending to blacken the memory of one who is dead or to impeach the honesty, virtue, or reputation, etc., of one who is alive, and thereby expose him to public hatred, contempt, or ridicule.\"<\/p> <p>Section 2 of said law provides the punishment for the offense described in section 1.<\/p> <p>It will be noted that section 1 says that \"A libel is a <em>malicious defamation,\"<\/em> etc. Section 2 which provides the punishment says that \"Every person who <em>willfully<\/em> and <em>with malicious<\/em> intent to injure another * * * shall be punished,\" etc.<\/p> <p>Section 3 provides that \"An injurious publication is presumed to have been malicious, <em>if no justifiable motives for making it are shown.\"<\/em><\/p> <p>Under section 1 malice is an essential ingredient of the offense of libel. By section 3 this essential ingredient or element of the offense may be presumed and need not be proved when the defendant fails to prove some justifiable motive. In other words, if the plaintiff should prove in an action for libel that a certain publication \"was injurious,\" it would be unnecessary for him to prove that said publication was made with malice; malice would then be presumed. The burden is then upon the defendant to show that such publication was made with \"justifiable motives.\" If the defendant fails in this he is liable under the law.<\/p> <p>Reading sections 1, 2, and 3, without reference to the other provisions of said laws, it would seem that no one can be punished for libel, if by any possibility he can show that the same was published with <em>\"justifiable motives.\"<\/em> The presence of justifiable motives eliminates the element of malice, and malice is a necessary ingredient of the offense. (U. S. <em>vs<\/em>. Lerma, 2 Phil. Rep., 254.) Was it the intention of the lawmaking body to relieve all persons from criminal liability for injurious publications simply by showing \"justifiable motives?\" If that was the intention, then what was the necessity of section 4, for example, which provides that the party committing the acts described in section 1 may be relieved from the punishment provided for in section 2, by permitting him to prove the truth of the alleged libelous matter?<\/p> <p>Section 4 relieves the party committing the acts described in section 1 from the punishment provided for in section 2, by permitting him to prove the truth of the alleged libelous matter. By a careful reading of said section 4, it will be seen that the truth is not an absolute defense. Under said section, the alleged libelous matter must not only be proved to be true, but it must be proved that it was published (<em>a<\/em>) \"with good motives,\" and (<em>b<\/em>) \"for justifiable ends.\"<\/p> <p>If, for example, the defendant in an action for libel should prove that his statements were true and fail to prove that they were published with good motives and for justifiable ends (or with justifiable motives) he would yet be liable to the punishment provided for in said section 2, for the law (sec. 4) expressly provides that, in the absence of proof of \"good motives\" and \"justifiable ends,\" the defendant shall be convicted.<\/p> <p>Reading sections 3 and 4 together, the question rises: May any injurious publication be made, with \"good motives\" and \"for justifiable ends,\" which is not true? In other words, if the defendant shows that the publication was made with \"justifiable motives,\" will that relieve him from criminal liability, admitting that the publication was false? This question has been answered in the affirmative in the cases of the United States <em>vs<\/em>. Lerma (2 Phil. Rep., 254), and United States <em>vs<\/em>. Crozier (5 Phil. Rep., 621).<\/p> <p>It will be difficult to harmonize section 3 with other sections (4 and 9) of the law unless we give practically the same meaning to the phrases \"justifiable motives\" in section 3, \"good motives and justifiable ends\" in section 4, and \"good faith,\" etc., in section 9.<\/p> <p>It is manifestly impossible to give illustrations of all the defenses which would show \"justifiable motives.\" These must be settled one at a time, from time to time, as cases arise. The law has, however, given us two cases: (<em>a<\/em>) the truth always when made with good motives and for justifiable ends (sec. 4); and (<em>b<\/em>) communications made under the conditions enumerated in section 9.<\/p> <p>In an action for libel suppose the defendant fails to prove that the injurious publication or communication was true. Can he relieve himself from liability by showing that it was published with \"justifiable motives\" whether such publication was true or false or even malicious? There is no <em>malice in law<\/em> when \"justifiable motives\" exist, and, in the absence of malice, there is no libel under the law. (U. S. <em>vs<\/em>. Lerma, <em>supra<\/em>.) But if there is <em>malice in fact,<\/em> justifiable motives can not exist. The law will not allow one person to injure another by an injurious publication, under the cloak of \"good ends\" or \"justifiable motives,\" when, as a matter of fact, the publication was made with a malicious intent. It is then a malicious defamation. The law punishes a <em>malicious defamation<\/em> and it was not intended to permit one to maliciously injure another under the garb of \"justifiable motives.\" When <em>malice in fact<\/em> is shown to exist the publisher can not be relieved from liability by a pretense of \"justifiable motives.\" Section 3 relieves the plaintiff from the necessity of proving malice simply when no justifiable motives are shown, but it does not relieve the defendant from liability under the guise of \"justifiable motives\" when malice actually is proved. The defense of \"the truth\" of the \"injurious publication\" (sec. 4) and its character as a privileged communication (sec. 9) means nothing more than the truth in one instance and the occasion of making it in the other together with proof of justifiable motive, rebuts the <em>prima facie<\/em> inference of <em>malice in law<\/em> and throws upon the plaintiff or the State, the onus of proving <em>malice in fact.<\/em> The publication of a <em>malicious defamation,<\/em> whether it be true or not, is clearly an offense under Act No. 277.<\/p> <p>Section 9 of said law furnishes another justification for the publication of matter that might be, under some conditions, considered libelous. Said section 9 provides that\u2014<\/p> <blockquote> <p>\"A private communication made by any person to another <em>in good faith,<\/em> in the performance of any duty, whether legal, moral, or social, <em>solely<\/em> with the fair and reasonable purpose of protecting the interests of the person making the communication, or in the interests of the person to whom the communication is made, <em>is a privileged communication,<\/em> and the person making the same shall not be guilty of libel nor be within the provisions of this Act.\"<\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>It will be noted from this section that, in order that a private communication, libelous in character, shall <em>be privileged,<\/em> certain conditions must exist:<\/p> <p>(<em>a<\/em>) It must be made in good faith;<\/p> <p>(<em>b<\/em>) It must be made in the performance of a duty, which duty must be legal, moral, or social; and<\/p> <p>(<em>c<\/em>) It must be made solely with the fair and reasonable purpose of protecting\u2014<\/p> <p>(1) The interests of the person making the communication; or<\/p> <p>(2) The interests of the person to whom the communication is made.<\/p> <p>It will be seen, then, from the provisions of this section that, if the communication was made, in good faith, for example, or in the performance of some legal, moral, or social duty, and <em>not<\/em> for <em>the sole purpose<\/em> of protecting the interests of the person making the same or the interests of the person to whom it was made, <em>it would not be a privileged communication<\/em>. Granting that, under said section 9, a private communication is made and published, in good faith, in the performance of a duty and with the sole purpose of the protection mentioned in said section, but is false and malicious, is it entitled to the privilege mentioned in said section, and is the party relieved from liability when the communication was made \"with good motives\" and for \"justifiable ends\" or with \"justifiable motives?\" Malicious motives are inconsistent with \"good motives,\" for \"justifiable ends\" and with \"justifiable motives.\" It was not the purpose of the Legislature to make the \"private communication\" in section 9 \"absolutely privileged.\" Such communications must also be free from malice.<\/p> <p>Section 9 must be read in connection with sections 3 and 4. Section 4 provides that in <em>all<\/em> criminal prosecutions, etc., the party charged with libel may be relieved from criminal responsibility, under the conditions therein mentioned. It would seem, therefore, that one who is charged with libel and seeks the privilege granted under section 9, must always comply with the conditions, under which the privilege is granted, mentioned in sections 3 and 4. The mere fact that a private communication is made in good faith, etc., under section 9, will not relieve the party from responsibility, unless he can show that the same was made \"with good motives,\" \"for justifiable ends,\" and \"with justifiable motives\" and without malice.<\/p> <p>In the case of the United States <em>vs<\/em>. Lerma (2 Phil. Rep., 254), the communication was a private communication (a petition) made to a justice of the peace before whom a criminal complaint was pending against the defendant. The lower court found the defendant guilty.<\/p> <p>In that case this court found (p. 259) that\u2014<\/p> <blockquote> <p>\"The matter contained in the petition presented to the justice by the defendant all related to the supposed prosecutions against the latter, and we think the circumstances of the case show quite conclusively that the sole motive of the defendant in presenting the petition was to defend himself against those charges. It was not an attempt to make use of judicial proceedings as a vehicle for the utterance of slander. It was merely an exercise of the natural right which a person accused of crime possesses, and which it is for the public interests that he should enjoy unhampered so long as he exercises it in good faith and in a proper manner, to bring to the notice of the tribunal which is to pass upon his guilt all such considerations as he thinks may influence its judgment in his behalf, even though he may in so doing \"incidentally disparage private character.\" In the sense of the law we think, therefore, that the defendant's motives must be regarded as justifiable.\"<\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>In the case of Lerma (<em>supra<\/em>) he believed that he was being persecuted and, after stating his grounds for this belief, petitioned the justice of the peace to hear him before any sentence should be rendered against him. This right to be heard was a right accorded to him under the law. He simply stated in his petition what he had a right to say before the justice of the peace in open court. (Sec. 7, Act No. 277.) There was no malice shown. He merely exercised a natural right which he possessed. His petition was made to one who had a right to hear it and one who had power to remedy the wrong if one had been done. The petition was clearly presented in good faith and with the sole purpose of protecting the interest of the one making it and with justifiable motives. Had this same communication been made to a third person who had no interest to be protected, or who could in noway protect the interest of the one making it, even though with good faith, would it have been protected under section 9? Section 9 provides that such communications must be made with the <em>sole purpose<\/em> of protecting the interest (<em>a<\/em>) of the one making it and (<em>b<\/em>) or of the one to whom it is made. This section clearly implies that such communications must be made not only for the purpose of protecting the interest of the one making it, but that such communications <em>must be made to persons who have the power to furnish such protection<\/em>. Otherwise such communications would be idle and that provision of the law meaningless. In a government where all or practically all of the higher officials are appointed without the consent of the governed, every avenue of communication between the former and the latter should be left open, and this was one of the evident purposes of section 9. <em>Said section did not contemplate, however, that the files of any and every department of the government should be filled with idle effusions of malignity and detraction with perfect immunity.<\/em> Its purpose, among other things, was to permit all interested persons or citizens with grievances, to freely communicate, with immunity, to the persons who could furnish the protection asked for, requiring, however, at all times that such petitions or communications shall be made in good faith or \"with justifiable motives.\" This privilege must not be abused. If it appears that the communication was made maliciously or to persons who could not furnish the protection, then the mere pretext can not afford protection under the law, nor furnish an occasion for a privileged communication.<\/p> <p>In the present case the communication (a part of which is found in paragraphs (<em>c<\/em>) and (<em>d<\/em>) in the complaint) was a private one. It was made with the evident intention of having said judge and prosecuting attorney removed from office. There was no pretense that the injurious communication was made for the <em>sole<\/em> purpose of protecting the interests of the defendant or for the purpose of protecting the interests of the Secretary of Justice to whom it was made. The concluding part of said communication shows quite a different purpose. The conclusion is:<\/p> <blockquote> <p>\"Said facts sufficiently explain the partiality with which they [the judge and fiscal] have both acted in the criminal case against Jose Rivero for robbery. But as the dismissal ordered in this case does not, in my opinion, prevent the bringing of a new case against him for the same crime, of robbery, that is to say, for the acts which have been denounced, I appeal to Your Honor [the Secretary of Justice] petitioning that you issue the proper order to the end that some fiscal of the Government other than the provincial fiscal of Ilocos Sur, Sr. Vicente Singson, bring information of the acts against the said Jose Rivero, and that he be tried by some judge other than the Honorable Dionisio Chanco.<\/p> <p>\"Respectfully petitioned.<\/p> <p align=\"right\">(Signed) \"JULIO BUSTOS, <em>petitioner<\/em>.\"<\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>The burden of the petition seems to be, as indicated by the above quotation, to have the said Jose Rivero brought to trial upon a charge for the crime of robbery.<\/p> <p>Neither do we believe that the communication was made in good faith. The defendant, during the trial of the cause, admitted that he had personally made no investigation with reference to the truth of many of the statements made in said communication, and especially with reference to the statements relating to the rumors that the said judge and prosecuting attorney had received a bribe in a particular case. The defendant stated that he had heard the said rumor from two or three persons. These persons were called as witnesses and they each stated that they had made no investigation whatever with reference to the rumors referring to the said bribery and the other illegal acts charged against the said judge and fiscal.<\/p> <p>It seems clear to us that the communication was malicious, was not made in good faith, nor was it made with the <em>sole<\/em> purpose of protecting either the interests of the defendant or for protecting the interests of the Secretary of Finance and Justice, and is, therefore, not a privileged communication. The communication having been made, as we believe, with malice, and without the presence of the justifiable motives mentioned in said section 9, we are of the opinion and so hold that the sentence of the lower court should be revoked and that the defendant should be sentenced to be imprisoned for a period of six months, to pay a fine of P100, and to pay the costs.<\/p> <em>Arellano, C.

In that action, after an exhaustive preliminary examination, the defendant Riviera, was held for trial in the Court of First Instance by the justice of the peace before whom the complaint was filed; but the complaint was dismissed in that court, without trial, upon the motion of the provincial fiscal or prosecuting attorney, and apparently without investigation by the trial judge. The civil damages to which Bustos claims he would have been entitled upon a judgment of conviction in that action amounted to more than P25,000; and the procedure adopted by him in instituting a criminal action, with a view to the recovery of civil damages, was adopted under advice of counsel, and was in accordance with the usual practice under Spanish procedural law, a practice which is still generally followed under those provisions of the Spanish Penal Code which are continued in force, and which permit the recovery of civil damages by the offended party in criminal actions, where the facts are such as to sustain a judgment of conviction.<\/p> <p>In the province wherein this litigation was pending, a rumor had gained more or less circulation to the effect that the local law officers of the Government were guilty of malfeasance of office, and that the trial judge, the provincial fiscal or prosecuting attorney, the provincial clerk of the court, and perhaps some other court officials were corrupt, and had taken bribes on one or more occasions. No evidence appears in the record which casts any reflection upon the integrity of the judge or the provincial fiscal; but it does appear that some time before the institution of these proceedings, the then clerk of the Court of First Instance was dismissed from office as a result of financial irregularities, and maladministration in the conduct of his office; and there is evidence in the record to the effect that this person, on one or more occasions, threatened to involve the judge and provincial fiscal in his own downfall, if they pressed criminal proceedings against him, intimating that they were parties with him in the financial wrongdoing with which he was charged. Bustos, believing that the complaint filed by him had been improperly dismissed, and claiming that he did not believe that he could with safety submit the conduct and judgment of his case to the prosecuting attorney and judge of the court wherein it was filed, came to Manila and laid his case verbally before the Attorney-General of the Philippine Islands, and by his advice before the Honorable H. C. Ide, then Secretary of Finance and Justice and Acting Governor-General of the Philippine Islands. That official informed Bustos that he could take no action on a mere verbal complaint, which would not justify the institution of the necessary investigation, and directed or suggested that the accused file a written complaint, expressly or impliedly agreeing that, if upon investigation the complaint appeared to be well founded, the complainant would have the relief sought. Bustos then prepared and submitted to the Secretary of Finance and Justice and Acting Governor-General, a written communication wherein he set out at considerable length the alleged improper procedure whereby the criminal action instituted by him had been dismissed, and prayed that a new judge and fiscal be sent to the province, for the purpose of rehearing and reconsidering his complaint; in support of his petition for a change of law officers in his province he set out a number of instances of alleged misconduct and incompetence on the part of the judge, prosecuting attorney, and clerk, and stated that it was rumored in his province that these and perhaps some other court officials were corrupt, and had taken bribes on one or more occasions, giving the alleged details of one specific case, wherein it was said that certain officials, including the trial judge, provincial fiscal, and the clerk of the court, conspired together, and for the sum of 6,000 pesos, procured the dismissal of a grave criminal complaint, in a case known as the Narvacan murder case. The Secretary of Finance and Justice forwarded a copy of this complaint to the various officers whose names were mentioned therein, and later a complaint was filed against Bustos in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, charging him with the crime of libel, of which crime he was convicted, and upon conviction sentenced to three months' imprisonment in the Insular Prison at Bilibid and to pay a fine of 100 pesos and the costs of the prosecution; the trial judge (in the language of his decision) stating that \"the fact that the defendant was seeking to obtain a new trial of the case in which he may have considered himself wronged, and that he consulted with the Attorney-General and Chief of the Bureau of Justice, before making the petition, should, in the opinion of the court, be construed a mitigating circumstance, and taken into consideration by the court in fixing the penalty.\"<\/p> <p>The trial court appears to have convicted the accused, notwithstanding his claim of privilege, on the theory that under the provisions of section 4 of the Libel Act, it was incumbent on the accused to prove that not only did he make the injurious and defamatory publication on a privileged occasion, but that the facts set out therein were true, and that the trial judge and provincial fiscal had in fact accepted bribes.<\/p> <p>The majority opinion in this court, however, apparently recognizes and reaffirms (with certain modifications and limitations) the doctrine laid down by this court in the case of The United States <em>vs<\/em>. Lerma (2 Phil. Rep., 254), wherein it was held that when it is shown that an injurious publication was made with a justifiable motive, it is not incumbent on the defendant to prove the truth of the statements made by him on that occasion; but it affirms the judgment of conviction in the court below on the ground that the accused failed to establish his right to have his communication treated as a privileged communication, under the provisions of section 9 of the Act. This section, however, is limited by its terms to the privilege accorded upon certain conditions to <em>private communications,<\/em> made by one person to another in the performance of some duty, whether legal, moral, or social, while the communication in question, was in no proper sense a <em>private communication,<\/em> having been submitted for the purpose and with the expectation that it would be followed by a public investigation, and that its contents would be communicated to others; and although the fact that the accused appears to have exercised commendable discretion in avoiding an excessive publication gives to his communication the appearance of a <em>private communication,<\/em> as defined in section 9 of the Act, the real ground of the privilege, as it appears to me, is to be sought elsewhere.<\/p> <p>The first nine sections of the Libel Law, Act No. 277 of the Philippine Commission, are as follows:<\/p> <blockquote> <p>\"SECTION 1. A libel is a malicious defamation, expressed either in writing, printing, or by signs or pictures, or the like, or public theatrical exhibitions, tending to blacken the memory of one who is dead or to impeach the honesty, virtue, or reputation, or publish the alleged or natural defects of one who is alive, and thereby expose him to public hatred, contempt, or ridicule.<\/p> <p>\"SEC. 2. Every person who willfully and with a malicious intent to injure another publishes or procures to be published any libel shall be punished by a fine of not exceeding two thousand dollars or imprisonment for not exceeding one year, or both.<\/p> <p>\"SEC. 3. An injurious publication is presumed to have been malicious if no justifiable motive for making it is shown.<\/p> <p>\"SEC. 4. In all criminal prosecutions for libel the truth may be given in evidence to the court, and if it appears to the court that the matter charged as libelous is true and was published with good motives and for justifiable ends, the party shall be acquitted; otherwise he shall be convicted; but to establish this defense, not only must the truth of the matter so charged be proven, but also that it was published with good motives and for justifiable ends.<\/p> <p>\"SEC. 5. To sustain a charge of publishing a libel it is not needful that the words or things complained of should have been read or seen by another. It is enough that the accused knowingly parted with the immediate custody of the libel under circumstances which exposed it to be read or seen by any other person than himself.<\/p> <p>\"SEC. 6. Every author, editor, or proprietor of any book, newspaper, or serial publication is chargeable with the publication of any words contained in any part of such book or number of each newspaper or serial as fully as if he were the author of the same.<\/p> <p>\"SEC. 7. No reporter, editor, or proprietor of any newspaper is liable to any prosecution for a fair and true report of any judicial, legislative, or other public official proceedings, or of any statement, speech, argument, or debate in the course of the same, except upon proof of malice in making such report, which shall not be implied from the mere fact of publication.<\/p> <p>\"SEC. 8. Libelous remarks or comments connected with matter privileged by the last section receive no privilege by reason of being so connected.<\/p> <p>\"SEC. 9. A private communication made by any person to another, in good faith, in the performance of any duty, whether legal, moral, or social, solely with the fair and reasonable purpose of protecting the interests of the person making the communication or the interests of the person to whom the communication is made, is a privileged communication, and the person making the same shall not be guilty of libel nor be within the provisions of this Act.\"<\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>These provisions were discussed and construed at considerable length in the case of The United States <em>vs<\/em>. Lerma (2 Phil. Rep., 254), wherein the accused, against whom a criminal complaint had been filed in the court of the justice of the peace, admitted having sent a sealed letter to the justice, containing highly defamatory expressions directed against the provincial governor and prosecuting attorney, charging them with various acts of wrongdoing, including the fabrication of false and malicious accusations and the extortion of affidavits in support of these charges. By a bare majority, this court held in that case that the effect of the above-cited section 3 of the Act \"is to make the existence of justifiable motives a complete defense to the prosecution for libel.\" Justices Willard and Cooper, in separate opinions, vigorously combated this proposition, contending that the sole purpose and object of section 3 is to do away with the necessity of proving malice in certain cases, by establishing a presumption of malice from the fact of the injurious publication, and that the provisions of this section should not be held to operate as an independent and substantive provision, being merely intended as a rule of evidence, fixing the burden of proof in certain cases. The majority opinion in the case at bar, while apparently accepting (with certain modifications and limitations) the general doctrine laid down in the Lerma case, treats the provisions of this section (as did Justices Willard and Cooper in the former case) rather from the standpoint of its effect as a rule of evidence touching presumptions than as a substantive provision furnishing a defense; and having thus questioned the reasoning on which the doctrine laid down in the Lerma case is based, fails, as I conceive, to lay down the broad principle upon which the doctrine thus modified should be based, and in the resulting uncertainty, rests the decision of this case (as did Justice Cooper his concurring vote in his separate opinion in the Lerma case) on the express provisions of section 9, which, in my opinion, are as inapplicable in the case at bar, as they were held to be in the Lerma case.<\/p> <p>The difficulty throughout the whole discussion, as it seems to me, is the apparent belief in the necessity for, and the attempt to discover an express provision of the statute exempting from the penalties prescribed therein, persons who merely \"incidentally disparage private character\" in the performance of some duty, or in the exercise of a natural right, or of a right secured to them by law, on any occasion where public policy requires that freedom of speech and action should not be unnecessarily hampered or abridged by the fear of prosecution and punishment.<\/p> <p>Thus the writer of the Lerma decision seems to have undertaken, by inverting the language of section 3 of the Act, to find an express provision that where a justifiable motive for making the injurious publication is shown, it must be presumed <em>not to have been malicious,<\/em> and as a consequence, that proof of the existence of a justifiable motive is \"a complete defense to a charge of libel.\" But aside from the reasons advanced by the writers of the separate opinions in that case in declining to accept the reasoning upon which this conclusion is based; and the reasons advanced in the majority opinion in the case at bar in modifying and limiting the force of the doctrine thus stated; I think that, confining ourselves strictly to an examination of the language of this section, it will appear that its terms in themselves do not support the conclusion as unreservedly stated in the Lerma case, and that we must look elsewhere for the grounds upon which justifiable motives are to be admitted as a defense in libel cases. The logical result of the inversion of the language of the section is that where a justifiable motive for making an injurious publication is shown, <em>there is no presumption of the existence of malice;<\/em> and, <em>not<\/em> that the publication <em>must be presumed not to have been malicious;<\/em> so that in such cases, the existence or nonexistence of malice, one of the essential ingredients of the offense, as defined in section 1, becomes a question of fact, to be proven or disproven, as is any other essential allegation in a criminal action, the only presumption admissible being the presumption of innocence, which casts its mantle around the accused at every stage of the proceedings in this as well as in all other criminal actions.<\/p> <p>Thus also the writers of the separate opinions in the Lerma case, who dissented from the construction placed upon section 3 by the majority, appear to have been of opinion, that (except in those cases where the truth is proven as expressly provided in section 4 of the Act, and the cases provided for in sections 7 and 9, which under certain conditions expressly exempt from liability newspaper reports of judicial and legislative proceedings, and certain private communications), the Act fails to provide for the exemption of liability of persons who in the United States and England would be exempted because the otherwise libelous matter was uttered on a \"privileged occasion;\" Justice Williard being of opinion that there is and can be no privilege for injurious or defamatory statements made in the course of judicial proceedings, express provision therefor having been omitted from the Act; and Justice Cooper, while not in full agreement with this conclusion, resorting to the privilege expressly granted to private communications in section 9 of the Act to relieve the accused from criminal responsibility on account of defamatory statements, made in the course of judicial proceedings.<\/p> <p>Thus also, as it seems to me, the writer of the majority opinion in the case at bar, while he accepts with some modifications and limitations the doctrine laid down in the Lerma case, fails to lay down the broad principle on which the modified doctrine securely rests, and does not appear to recognize that the doctrine thus modified carries with it as a necessary consequence the general doctrine of qualified privilege as it is laid down by the authorities in England and the United States, except so far as that doctrine may be modified either by the express provisions of sections 7 and 9 of the Act or by peculiar conditions existing in these Islands. As a result, in its last analysis, the judgment of the court is based on the failure of the accused to prove that his communication was privileged as a \"private communication,\" under the express terms of section 9, when as I believe, the true ground of the privilege under which the accused should be acquitted, is the right of the citizen, under proper restrictions, to submit complaints against public officers, in regard to their character or conduct, to the functionary having authority to redress grievances, to remove such officials from office, and to appoint their successors.<\/p> <p>I think that, in general, the circumstances under which one has a right to publish defamatory matter, so as to give it the quality of a privileged communication, in other words, the determination of what are justifiable motives which will negative the presumption of malice, raised under the provisions of section 3, are not to be sought in the express provisions of the law, for, as intimated in the Lerma decision, they rest on \"principles of natural right as well as of public policy too obvious to require any express recognition in the written law;\" and that in each particular case it becomes the duty of the court to determine whether the particular circumstances sustain the claim of privilege, basing its conclusion on those broad principles, except in so far as their application is modified or controlled by express provision of law.<\/p> <p>Examining the provisions of the statute (keeping in mind that it was enacted by an American Commission, the majority of whose members were American lawyers, and that its provisions are borrowed almost verbatim from the statutes of one or other of States of the Union; and keeping in mind also the construction placed on section 4, in the opinion of this court in the Lerma case, a construction which is in strict accord with the juridical and legislative history of the evolution of the doctrine by virtue of which, as a rule, in the United States, the truth may be given in evidence in libel cases) I find nothing in its terms which limits or denies the duty and authority of this court to declare that those principles of natural right and justice, and the requirements of public policy which gave rise to the doctrine of privilege in the United States and England, are not less efficacious in support of the existence of a similar doctrine in this jurisdiction. On the contrary, the statute taken as a whole manifestly recognizes the necessity for, and the existence of this doctrine. Thus section 3, while it does not, as I believe, make proof of conditions which, <em>prima facie,<\/em> establish the existence of a justifiable motive, a complete defense, clearly indicates that in making an injurious publication one may be actuated by a justifiable motive; and when it appears from the circumstances under which the publication was made that such publication may have been actuated by justifiable motives, there is nothing in the statute which penalizes the act unless it further appears that the accused was actuated by malice in fact, or, as it is sometimes called, express or actual malice. So again section 4 clearly recognizes the fact that defamatory matter may be published with good motives and justifiable ends. And so the language of sections 7, 8, and 9, expressly recognizes the existence of certain privileged defamatory communications, while it is manifest that in thus enumerating and defining two instances of privileged communications the lawmaker did not attempt to exhaust the classification.<\/p> <p>It has been said that in thus importing into this jurisdiction the doctrine of privilege, or rather in thus recognizing the limitations and restrictions placed upon the provisions of the Libel Law by the principles on which that doctrine rests, the courts and the people are left \"without a guide or compass\" in determining on what occasions an injurious publication is or is not to be considered privileged, with the result that the courts are left at perfect liberty to decide each case, without reference to any rules whatever which declare what are and what are not justifiable motives, as that term is used in the statutes. Resting the doctrine, as I contend it should rest, on those broad principles of natural right and public policy, upon which it rests in England and the United States, and by reference to which it has been formulated and established, it must necessarily result that sound reasoning upon these principles as applied to the statute under consideration, will lead to substantially the same conclusions in this jurisdiction as it has in the jurisdictions from which the provisions of that statute have been adopted, modified only so far as may be required by exceptional conditions existing here, and local statutes. Thus we have in the sound reasoning upon which the doctrine has been established in the multitude of reported cases in England and the United States, a safe and authoritative guide to a just conclusion in the various cases which may present themselves in this jurisdiction.<\/p> <p>I have been led into a much more extended discussion of the doctrine than I had anticipated, partly as a result of my conviction that the legislator not having attempted to define, except in a few cases, what circumstances go to make an injurious publication on a particular occasion a privileged communication, or, in other words, what may constitute a justifiable motive in making such a publication, the rulings of this court declaring that a particular set of circumstances do or do not constitute a privileged occasion, under the provisions of the Libel Law as enacted here under American sovereignty, are of the utmost importance as establishing precedents; and partly because the case at bar, being the first which has been brought to this court involving the particular privilege to the benefits of which the accused is in my opinion entitled, I think the failure of the majority decision to define and qualify that privilege, and the basing of the decision on a privilege grounded on entirely different principles, is likely to lead to grave confusion, and in this case has resulted in an erroneous judgment.<\/p> <p>In the case at bar, the accused addressed a communication complaining against the character, integrity, and conduct of certain public officials to the Secretary of Finance and Justice and Acting Governor-General of these Islands, that functionary being the officer ultimately charged with the supervision, appointment, and removal of the officials complained against.<\/p> <p>No one will deny that the plainest principles of natural right and sound public policy require that the utmost possible freedom should be afforded every citizen over whom a public official has been appointed to complain to the supervising, removing, and appointing authority set over such official, of his official misconduct; and as might be expected, we find a great number of cases in the English and American law reports holding that such communications are to be regarded as conditionally or qualifiedly privileged, so that in the absence of actual or express malice, the complainants must be held free from liability, on account of defamatory or injurious matter contained in such complaints. (White <em>vs<\/em>. Nicholas et al., 44 U. S., 266. See also numerous cases cited under this head in the digests and encyclopedias.)<\/p> <p>In these Islands where the people have no direct part in the election or appointment of many if not most of the higher Government officials; where the ultimate appointing, removing, and supervising authority over all judicial and most executive officials is vested in the hands of men who are of a different race, tongue, and habits of thought and action from the vast majority of those over whom they are set in authority: where, more especially in the provinces, there is no intelligent public opinion with its salutary and restraining influence on local officials; where official reports, based on experience in the past, so frequently decry the tendency on the part of inferior officials to forget that a public office is a public trust, and criticize and deplore the supine attitude of the mass of the people who so often permit themselves to be plundered and abused, without complaint and without an effort to rid themselves of their plunderers; where one of the greatest difficulties in the administration of government and the correction of abuses is the oftentimes insurmountable difficulties encountered in procuring testimony against wrongdoers clothed with the insignia of office; it seems to me that public policy requires, even more imperatively than in England or the United States, that every avenue of communication between the aggrieved citizen and the appointing authority should be jealously guarded, so as not unnecessarily to abridge or to limit the right of the citizen to complain of abuses, and seek redress for wrongs.<\/p> <p>Manifestly, therefore, a conditional or qualified privilege exists in these Islands as to such communications, with no greater restrictions or limitations attached thereto than have been placed upon the like privilege in England and the United States. The limitations and restrictions uniformly placed on the privilege in those jurisdictions are, first, that such complaints must be made to a functionary having authority to redress the grievances complained of; and, second, that they must be made in good faith, and must not be actuated by actual or express malice; and an examination of the nature of the privilege leaves no room for doubt that like restrictions and limitations and no others should be held to attach to this privilege in this jurisdiction.<\/p> <p>That the complaint under consideration was made to the proper functionary, if a complaint could have been properly made at all, is not and can not be questioned, and the only question which remains is whether the record discloses the existence of express or actual malice or the absence of good faith on the part of the complainant. I am satisfied that keeping in mind the purpose and object which the accused had in filing this complaint, the attitude of the accused toward the parties complained of, the conditions existing in his community at the time when that complaint was made, and the procedure adopted by the accused in submitting his complaint, as these facts are disclosed by the record, he must be held to have adopted the course he did, without actual malice and in good faith.<\/p> <p>The trial court found as a fact that the defendant was seeking to obtain a new trial of the case in which he may have considered himself wronged; though in the opinion of the trial judge, this fact together with the fact that he consulted with the Attorney-General and Chief of the Bureau of Justice before making the petition, constituted merely a mitigating circumstance. I think that the arduous and expensive efforts which he made to bring to trial the person whom he charges with having robbed him of his patrimony while he was yet in his nonage, the fact that this person was held for trial at the preliminary investigation, and the testimony of the accused himself on the witness stand, leave no room for doubt, in the absence of any evidence whatever to the contrary, that not only \"may\" it be a fact, but that it is a fact that he considered himself wronged by the dismissal of the criminal complaint in the Riviera case filed by him. Believing himself wronged by the action of the provincial fiscal, in moving the dismissal of the case in which he had so large an interest, he left his native province, and came to consult with the Attorney-General of the Islands, that official being charged with a general supervisory authority over the provincial fiscals. That official advised him to lay his case before the Secretary of Finance and Justice, then the Acting Governor-General, and after consultation with and at the suggestion of this official, the accused filed a long communication setting out at length and in detail the grounds of his complaint against the various officers of the Court of First Instance of his province, to which he signed his name. This quite exceptional mode of procedure, in a country where the custom of filing anonymous charges and complaints is all too prevalent, taken together with the fact that the accused was informed by the Acting Governor-General that the written complaint was desired with a view to the institution of an investigation upon the result of which future action on the complaint would be predicated, strongly tends to confirm my belief that, rightly or wrongly, the accused in good faith believed in the righteousness of his cause, and that in filing his petition he sought merely to bring about the correction of the alleged disgraceful conditions in his province, and his own relief from what he believed to be a miscarriage of justice.<\/p> <p>I am satisfied not only that there is not a scintilla of evidence in the record on which to base a finding of express malice, in the ordinary acceptation of that term, that is to say, of a state of mind or feeling which induced the accused to file the injurious complaint, for the purpose of injuring the persons complained of, wrongfully and intentionally, without just cause or excuse; but also that the record affirmatively discloses the absence of such an attitude of mind or intent, on the part of the accused, as the moving factor in filing his complaint.<\/p> <p>It clearly appears from the record that the accused had no personal acquaintance with the trial judge, and that until the provincial fiscal procured the dismissal of the case instituted by the accused (which was the particular grievance which the accused sought to remedy), no unfriendly or inimical relations existed between them; the complaint, taken as a whole, while it severely animadverts on the official conduct and integrity of the officials complained of, contains nothing which would necessarily indicate that the accused was actuated in submitting it by any other motive than that expressly set out therein; and its allegations of misconduct though forcefully and vigorously stated, are no more so than the accused may well have deemed necessary for a clear exposition of the grounds of his complaint; and there is nothing in the record which tends to disclose that he himself did not believe his every allegation well founded and true in every particular.<\/p> <p>But the courts have frequently held that proof that injurious publications have been made with reckless indifference as to their truth or falsity, and without probable cause, is sufficient to establish the existence of actual malice and a lack of good faith in making such publications. (Locke <em>vs<\/em>. Bradstreet Co., 22 Fed. Rep., 771; Footbaker <em>vs<\/em>. Conant, 91 Me., 438; Karger <em>vs<\/em>. Rich, 81 Wis., 177; Bradstreet Co. <em>vs<\/em>. Gill, 72 Tex., 115; Howland <em>vs<\/em>. Flood, 160 Mass., 517.) This proposition can not fail of the approval of every fair-minded man, and if the record discloses such conduct on the part of the accused, the fact that his complaint was filed on what would otherwise be a privileged occasion can not and should not shield him from liability, civil and criminal, for the injury thus inflicted on others.<\/p> <p>The question whether an injurious statement as to another has been made with reckless indifference as to truth or falsity, and without probable cause, must in the very nature of things depend largely on the particular circumstances under which the statement was made and the degree of caution which those circumstances impose as to the verification of the truth of such statements. And it is, I take it, because we view the conduct of the accused from wholly different standpoints, that I am unable to agree with the findings of the trial court in this regard. The trial judge evidently was much impressed with the failure of the accused to prove the truth of his allegations, and from the form of his findings I am satisfied that he was influenced in making these findings by his belief that under the provisions of section 4 of the Act, the accused had no right to submit his complaint, unless each and every charge contained therein was well founded in the sense that when he submitted them, the accused was prepared to submit evidence in support of the truth of each and every allegation, and especially that the officials complained of had in fact accepted bribes. From this point of view, I am entirely agreed with him that the accused must be held to have made his charges recklessly and heedlessly, and that the information upon which he acted was not such as to justify him in bringing those charges or in believing that he himself could establish the truth of these charges at any time he might be called upon so to do. In other words, from the point of view of the trial judge, they were not made in good faith.<\/p> <p>So the majority opinion in this court, treating the communication as a private one, and applying the provisions of section 9 of the Act, finds that the object sought to be accomplished was not such as to give it the privilege expressly conferred by that article, it not having been published (in the language of the opinion adopted from the express provisions of that section) \"for the sole purpose of protecting the interests of the defendant, or for the purpose of protecting the interests of the Secretary of Finance and Justice, to whom it was made,\" but merely to have one \"Jose Riviera brought to trial upon a charge of the crime of robbery;\" and I readily agree that if the accused, as a citizen of the Province of Ilocos Norte and as a litigant in the courts of that province, wherein he was asserting property rights of great alleged value, did not have an interest in the removal of alleged incompetent or corrupt officials, with a view to bringing his case before a tribunal differently constituted, such as to give him a perfect right to complain to higher authority with a view to the institution of an official investigation and the removal of these officials if the result of such investigation established his charge of misconduct and incompetency, then indeed the gratuitous repetition by the accused of the rumors, without <em>personal investigation<\/em> as to their truth, must be regarded as malicious and as not made in good faith.<\/p> <p>Upon no other theory can I account for the fact that, wholly disregarding the fact conclusively established by the testimony that the rumors referred to by the accused did in fact exist (a fact not questioned in the majority opinion); and disregarding the fact that the accused did in fact <em>institute<\/em> a personal investigation into the truth of these rumors, and for that purpose sought to secure the necessary preliminary data from the clerk's office, but was practically compelled to desist from the prosecution of his investigation by the action of the judge and the clerk of the court in limiting his right to examine the records to those cases in which he could show that he had an interest; and disregarding also the fact that it may well be doubted whether a private citizen should or could with safety carry on a \"personal investigation,\" without the aid of proper authority, of rumored charges of corruption and bribe-taking directed against the judge and other officials of a Court of First Instance; the majority opinion finds that the accused was lacking in good faith in filing his complaint, on the sole ground that neither he, nor any of the witnesses called by him to prove the existence of the rumor, had actually made a personal investigation as to its truth.<\/p> <p>I do not, of course, contend that proof of the existence of the rumor would even tend to prove the truth of the contents of the rumor, and indeed for that purpose it would in a libel case be wholly incompetent evidence; nor do I contend that proof of the existence of the rumor would justify or excuse one who repeated it under ordinary circumstances and without a justifiable motive; but I do contend that, where one sets out the fact of the existence of a rumor of official misconduct in the course of a complaint having for its object an official investigation of the conduct of certain officials, proof of the existence of the rumor is competent and proper evidence of good faith on the part of the complainant, just as proof that no such rumor existed would be strong and almost conclusive testimony of bad faith; and I contend further that, if we keep in mind the true nature of the privilege claimed by the accused, that his complaint was filed for the purpose of securing an official investigation into the conduct of certain officials and their removal as a result of that investigation, and that the existence of these rumors was only one of many facts alleged by the accused as ground for the belief that an official investigation should be had and that, as a result of that investigation, his charges of official misconduct would be sustained, and if we keep in mind further the utter impracticability, as a rule, of an attempt by a private citizen to hold personal investigation to verify or disprove such rumors; a finding of a lack of good faith, based on the sole ground that no such investigation was had, should not be sustained.<\/p> <p>That a rumor such as was mentioned in the complaint filed by Bustos was at that time current in the Province of Ilocos Norte is, I think, satisfactorily established by the testimony of record. True the number of witnesses was limited, and a partially successful attempt was made to show that some of these witnesses were unfriendly to the provincial judge, and the reputation of one of these witnesses for truth and honesty was successfully impeached by evidence of his conviction of <em>estafa<\/em> on one occasion; but it must be remembered that the trial was had in Manila, at a long distance from the province wherein the witnesses resided, and that, under all the circumstances, it must have been extremely difficult, no matter how widespread the rumor may have been, to secure the presence of witnesses who would be willing to expose themselves and their friends to the possible risk of consequences arising out of the giving of testimony touching the repetition of a libelous rumor directed against the local judge and provincial fiscal. But, in the absence of evidence to the contrary (save only the testimony of the judge and fiscal themselves, who might well be expected to be in ignorance of the existence of a rumor of this nature), I think the evidence of record is fully sufficient to sustain a finding of the existence of the rumor, and this without the aid of the presumption of innocence in favor of the accused.<\/p> <p>The trial judge expressly finds that, prior to the filing of the complaint by Bustos, an official report was prepared and submitted by a secret service employee of the Constabulary, who was detailed by his superior officer to investigate the sending of an anonymous letter to the provincial judge, and reported that it was currently rumored that the judge and fiscal had taken the bribe mentioned by Bustos in his complaint. This secret service officer was the witness whose reputation for truth and veracity was successfully impeached as mentioned above; but, as the trial judge finds, there can be no reasonable doubt of the truth of his testimony as to the fact that an investigation was made and the report filed as testified by him. It being accepted as true that a secret service employee of the Constabulary entered a remote province in these Islands, and made a secret investigation touching the character and conduct of the local judge and fiscal, and reported the existence of such a rumor, I would not need much additional testimony to satisfy me that, even if no such rumor existed theretofore, it would be found to exist thereafter; and all the more so in view of the testimony of the prosecution tending to prove that the secret service agent was unfriendly to the officials affected by the rumor.<\/p> <p>It is also clear from the record that the clerk of the Court of First Instance of the Province of Ilocos Norte was dismissed for financial irregularities in the conduct of his office, some time prior to the filing of the complaint by Bustos; and I think it also appears that this official threatened or boasted that he would involve the judge and fiscal in his downfall if criminally prosecuted. Knowing the relations which in the popular mind in these Islands are supposed to exist between the judge of the Court of First Instance and the clerk, I would not be surprised if financial irregularities did in fact mark the conduct of the clerk's office, and especially if the disgraced clerk made the threats or boasts attributed to him, to learn that rumors had gained currency in the province connecting the judge himself with these irregularities.<\/p> <p>In view of these conditions, there seems to me to be no reason to doubt, to the prejudice of the defendant in a criminal action, the practically uncontradicted testimony of the accused and his witnesses, as to the existence of the rumors reported by him to the Secretary of Finance and Justice. This testimony is positive and definite, one of the witnesses, an American lawyer of good standing in this court, testifying as to the extent of these rumors of misconduct, incompetence, and corruption, in part as follows:<\/p> <blockquote> <p>\"While in Vigan, and I was there about a month in that case, I heard no end of rumors, statements made by people, some of whom I judge by their statements were open enemies of Fiscal Singson, and accounts of wrongs real or fancied; some of these statements were made by I would judge to be either enemies of Judge Chanco; others were made by persons evidently warm friends of Bustos and indifferent to the fiscal and to the judge; others of these statements were made to me by people apparently disinterested. Some of them were made to me by officers of the Constabulary, who apparently were not inclined to be friends of either Fiscal Singson or the judge; some of them were made by a new officer, whose name I can not recall, who was up there on a visit, in fact I do not recall the names of the other officers, and were made in various places at various times. Some of these were nothing more than old rumors and others gave grounds for the basis of the action. I remember of hearing of the Narvacan case reported there a number of times. I heard other cases by people one night at the governor's ball; two people or three called me off and told me about it; the exact details I do not know, or how much property or what. I did not pay much attention to those statements because the woods were full of them; Vigan itself was very much excited at that time, the whole of Vigan, on account of the Riviera case.\"<\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>And asked if, when Bustos filed his complaint, he intended \"to run this 6,000 pesos case to earth to find out all about it in Vigan,\" this witness replied: \"I? No, sir, but if I tried to run those rumors down in Vigan, I would be dead.\"<\/p> <p>I am convinced also, that there can be no reasonable doubt that before filing his petition, Bustos did in fact institute a personal investigation as to the truth of the rumors of corruption affecting the law officers of his province. To that end he went to the clerk's office, and attempted to secure a list of the various complaints in criminal cases dismissed without trial, the first step which would suggest itself to any intelligent man in an attempt to ascertain the truth or falsity of the rumors reported to the Secretary of Finance and Justice. He claims, however, that he was compelled to desist from his investigation by the action of the judge and clerk (two of the officials whose conduct he was attempting to investigate) who denied him free access to the records, and limited him in this respect, to his right to secure certified copies of documents in which he could show an interest. His testimony in this connection is fully and conclusively corroborated by the testimony of the judge and clerk, and the testimony of the clerk makes it very clear that it was no superficial investigation he was undertaking, for the objection raised to his examination of the records of the office was based on the fact that he was making himself a nuisance by his extended researches.<\/p> <p>In passing, I should perhaps observe that, in referring to the fact that the accused's efforts to investigate were rendered abortive by the judge and clerk, I am not necessarily criticizing their conduct in this regard. It is not to be supposed that the accused ventured to inform these officials that he was investigating their conduct, and seeking to ascertain the truth or falsity of rumors of their corruption; and the proper conduct of the clerk's office would in all probability justify the imposition of restrictions and conditions on the examination of the archives, which would render impracticable efforts of unauthorized persons to inspect and examine the various records, documents, and papers filed in the clerk's office, unless such persons could offer some reasonable explanation of the purposes of their investigation, or a special interest in the particular documents which they desired to examine. All this, however, merely emphasizes the futility, as a general rule, of personal investigations by private citizens of the truth of falsity of such rumors as those under consideration.<\/p> <p>It is true that the accused admitted, as set out in the majority opinion, that he had made no personal investigation of the truth of these rumors, and that he had not verified their truth or falsity; but this statement must be taken in connection with the other evidence of record, showing that he had attempted to make an investigation and setting out the reasons for his failure to carry out his plans; and it should also be noted that this admission was made in response to a question as to whether he had personally investigated the truth of the rumor in connection with the Narvacan case, and visited the scene of the alleged crime. It appears that Narvacan is a village located a considerable distance from the provincial capital, and the accused explains that he did not have the funds to undertake an investigation of this sort; and it may well be doubted whether any such investigation might be expected to serve any useful purpose, as showing the truth or falsity of the rumors of corruption of the provincial officers, except as an incident to an official investigation, involving thorough examination of the records and other evidence not likely to be available to a private citizen.<\/p> <p>An examination of all the evidence, and of the entire petition, of which a short extract is made the basis of this action, convinces me that, in view of the expressed motive which actuated the filing of this petition, and especially of the fact that it was filed with the expectation that it would be followed by an official investigation, there is no ground upon which to base a finding, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the accused, in filing his petition, was actuated by express or actual malice, or that there was an absence of good faith in his effort to secure redress for the grievances, which as a litigant and as a private citizen, he believed he suffered at the hands of the court officials in his province.<\/p> <p>In conclusion, I should perhaps repeat, that I would not deem it necessary to set out at length my reasons for differing with my brethren as to the mere question of fact, touching the existence or nonexistence of malice and good faith, were I not convinced that our difference on this point arises not from any substantial difference as to the value and weight of the evidence of record, but from the fact that, in arriving at our findings of fact, we view the testimony from wholly different standpoints; and that I deem the failure of the majority opinion to define and to give full force and effect to the privilege arising from the right of the citizen to seek redress of alleged grievances, and the precedent established thereby, as of vital importance and grave import in its effect on the future administration of government in these Islands.<\/p> <p>It may not be improper for me to add, that nothing appears in the record which would support a finding adverse to the probity and integrity of the judge of the Court of First Instance or the provincial fiscal, the complaining witnesses in this action; and that no attempt having been made to prove the truth of the rumors reported in the petition of the accused, my arguments and conclusions are not intended to, and do not in anywise reflect upon the character or conduct of these officials.<\/p><\/div>",

Bingham for the delivery of said revolver and ammunition or, in default thereof, for compliance with the conditions of said bond, the said W. 0. Bingham, with said revolver and ammunition in his possession, was engaged in the business of pearl fishing, and with a crew of eight men was on board his pearling schooner known as the <i>Tamarao<\/i> about 2\u00bdmiles south of the Island of Maripipi; that while thus engaged at said time and place there arose a severe storm; that said <i>schooner was sunk in about 80 fathoms of water through no fault of the said W.

H.

O. Bingham bound himself to the Government of the Philippine Islands to keep and care for a revolver and ammunition, for the possession of which he was granted a license by the chief of police of this city on the 22d of August, 1906, in accordance with the legal provisions cited, and to surrender the said revolver and ammunition whenever so required by the Government.<br\/><br\/>\"(<i>b<\/i>)\u00a0 That said obligation was secured by the other two<br\/>defendants jointly and severally with W. 0. Bingham, the principal, in the sum of $200, United States currency, payable to the plaintiff in case the said principal did not keep and care for the said weapon and ammunition, or failed to surrender the same when called upon by the Government of these Islands.<br\/><br\/>\"(<i>c<\/i>)\u00a0 That the said revolver and ammunition was not surrendered, nor could the same be surrendered by the defendant W.\u00a0 O. Bingham when he was called upon, for the reason that, without any fault of the defendant, they were lost during a strong gale which caused the foundering of the sloop <i>Tamarao<\/i>, on which the defendant, together with several members of the crew, was fishing pearls from the sea, toward the south of Maripipi Island; the revolver and ammunition went to the bottom of the sea together with the vessel, and it was impossible to recover the same.<br\/><br\/>\"The representative of the plaintiff, in view of the above facts, asks that judgment be entered as against the defendants sentencing them to pay the aforesaid $200,\u00a0 United States currency, with interest thereon from the 18th of April, 1907, and costs, for the reason that the plaintiff had been prejudiced to the said amount on account of the non-fulfillment of the said bond, and the\u00a0 defendants in turn claim that they be acquitted and exempted from such payment.<br\/><br\/>\"It is of course evident that the loss of the said revolver and ammunition, and the material impossibility on the part of the defendant, Bingham, to deliver said\u00a0 article to the plaintiff on demand was due to causes which were independent of his will; to an event which he could not have foreseen, or which, even if he had foreseen it, was unavoidable; to an event known under the Spanish law by the name of <i>caso fortuito<\/i>, and designated in American law as 'an act of God,' arising out of a natural cause,\u00a0 and not from man's will.<br\/><br\/>\"As a matter of fact, as maintained by the representative of the plaintiff, it is a well-established rule in American law, that where a person enters into or contracts an obligation by means of an\u00a0 express contract he can not be permitted to evade its compliance on the plea that such a contract is impracticable, or that it can not be carried out owing to an act of God, or to a <i>caso fortuito<\/i> or <i>force majeure<\/i>.\u00a0 It differs from where the obligation is imposed by the law, in which case the person bound may be relieved from complying by reason of facts or acts of such nature.\u00a0 This doctrine has been established by the courts of the United States in several decisions cited by the said representative.<br\/><br\/>\"However, this\u00a0 rule is\u00a0 not so absolute as to lack exceptions even within the American law, and its application must be adjusted\u00a0 to the principles of justice and equity, and depends upon the character, the nature, and sometimes upon the very conditions in\u00a0 the contract.'<br\/><br\/>\" 'Executory agreements ordinarily are made on the implied condition that the performance of the agreement shall not be rendered impossible by the intervention of some accidental and uncontrollable superior agency.\u00a0 In the civil law this agency is termed <i>vis major<\/i>; in the common law, act of God; and means an inevitable accident produced by an irresistible physical cause which human skill, could not have prevented or human judgment foreseen.\u00a0 The intervention of such an agency may excuse performance (Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 2d ed., vol. 1 (7), p. 147.)<br\/><br\/>\" 'The act of God which exempts one from an obligation in a contract is that which renders its performance impossible.'\u00a0 (Dewey <i>vs.<\/i> Alpena School Dist., 43 Mich., 480, 38 Am. Rep., 206.)<br\/><br\/>\" 'And akin to this is the case of contracts relating to some specific article which the act of God destroys.\u00a0 Here there is an implied condition in the promise that the preventing contingency shall not arise.'\u00a0 (Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 2d ed., vol. 7, p. 148.)<br\/><br\/>\"Furthermore, 'the rule that the intervention of the act of God will excuse performance does not apply where the essential purpose of the contract is capable of substantial accomplishment, although a literal performance has become physically impossible.'\u00a0 (Ibid.)<br\/><\/blockquote>In the present case the purpose or essertial object of the contract entered into between the Government of the Philippine Islands and the defendant, W. O. Bingham, was that the latter should care for and keep said weapon and ammunition, and deliver the same to the Government when the latter should demand it.\u00a0 This purpose, this end, can not be substantially accomplished because the said articles have disappeared and can not be recovered, as the parties have agreed to, and therefore, said rule may be applied to the said contract, or what is the same thing, that fortuitous event, that act of God excuses the defendant from the performance of said contract, and that the purpose or the essential object of the contract was what has already been stated is evident because the intention of the Government, upon imposing said obligation on the defendant, and of the latter in accepting it, was certainly not that said defendant and his bondsmen should pay the $200, United States currency, amount of the bond, but to prevent said revolver and ammunition passing into the possession of another person, or falling into the hands of evil doers, lawbreakers, or of persons who might make unlawful use of the same.<br\/><blockquote>\"It is also an established rule in American law, that:\u00a0 'When performance of a contract is dependent upon the continued existence of a given person or thing, and such continued existence was assumed as the basis of the agreement, the death of the person or the destruction of the thing puts an end to the obligation.'\u00a0 (7 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 2d ed., p. 116.)\u00a0 And that 'where a contract is entered into, of a continuing character, or to be performed at a future time, dependent upon the continued existence\u00a0 of a particular person or thing, or the continuing ability of the obligor to perform, subsequent death, destruction or disability will excuse the obligor from compliance with the terms of the contract\u00a0 (1 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 2d ed., pp. 590, 591, and decisions cited therein.)<br\/><br\/>\"And the reason of said rule is, that 'the liability of an obligor\u00a0 in a contract having reference to the continued existence of a particular person or thing does not in strictness constitute an exception to the general rule as to the liability of obligors in express contracts, but results from a reasonable construction of the contract with reference to its subject-matter.'\u00a0 (Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, <i>ibid<\/i>., 592.)<br\/><br\/>\"In the case at bar, the obligation contracted by the defendant, W. O. Bingham, and secured by the other two defendants, his bondsmen, was to care for and keep the revolver and ammunition, the use and possession of which had been granted to the former, and to surrender the same revolver and ammunition to the Government whenever so demanded; so that the said contract was based on the assumed existence of a determined thing, of the revolver and ammunition specified in the respective license, and the compliance of said contract was fixed for a future time, that is to say, whenever the Government should demand the surrender of the said weapon and ammunition, on the basis, of course, that such articles were in existence.<br\/><br\/>\"Therefore, inasmuch as the said revolver and cartridges were lost, or rather, buried at the bottom of the sea beyond the possibility of finding or recovering them, which is equivalent to their destruction, there can be no doubt whatever that, in applying the provisions of said rule of the American law, the defendant, W. O. Bingham, and consequently the other defendants, his bondsmen, have been excused from the performance of said obligation for the reasons which will hereafter be stated.<br\/><br\/>\"The said rule in the American law is more clearly and precisely contained in the provisions of article 1182 of the Civil Code in force, which reads:<br\/><br\/>\" 'An obligation, consisting in the delivery of a specified thing, shall be extinguished when said thing should be lost or destroyed without fault of the debtor and before he should be in default.'<br\/><br\/>\" <i>'It is understood,<\/i>' so reads article 1122 of the same code, 'that the thing is lost when it perishes, becomes unsalable, or disappears in such a manner that its existence is unknown, or it is not possible to recover it.'<br\/><br\/>\"As the revolver and cartridges that were in the possession of W. O. Bingham sank with the sloop <i>Tamarao,<\/i> they undoubtedly became unsalable, disappearing in such a manner that it is not now known where they are, that is, their existence; they were lost, and it is now impossible to recover the same, as has been agreed to between the parties to this suit.\u00a0 Said loss occurred without the fault of said defendant and before he was in default, because the Government did not call upon him to surrender the weapon and cartridges before the shipwreck took place, but several months after the occurrence.<br\/><br\/>\"'It is therefore unquestionable that the provisions of the Civil Code in regard to this matter are also in accordance with the American law.\u00a0 Both are based on the same thing, which is the material impossibility to comply with or substantially perform an obligation where the subject-matter does not exist.\u00a0 W. O. Bingham is not bound to comply with the said obligation for the reason that, according to law, it has become extinguished.<br\/><br\/>\"The bond obligation contracted for by the other two defendants jointly and severally with the principal obligor, W. O. Bingham, that is, the defendant, is accessory to the obligation contracted by the latter to deliver to the Government the revolver and cartridges whenever so required, and consequently it became extinguished at the same time as the principal obligation on account of the loss of said articles.\u00a0 (Art. 1847, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>\"That obligation was also an accessory one which was established or determined by the penalty clause to pay the plaintiff $200, United States currency, in case the defendant, W. O. Bingham, should fail to comply with the principal obligation, that is, to surrender said weapon and ammunition whenever required to do so because the said obligation was secured by means of said penalty clause; the defendants can not be compelled to suffer said penalty, to wit, to pay the said sum in lieu of delivering the revolver and cartridges mentioned above, for the reason that it is not an alternative obligation, since the defendant, W. O. Bingham, could not choose between delivering the weapon and ammunition when so required, or paying said amount; he was expressly obliged to keep said weapon and ammunition, and surrender them to the Government whenever so demanded in view of the special purposes of the Government in granting such licenses, which purposes are no other than, as it has already been stated, to prevent firearms in the hands of private individuals or of municipalities from falling into the possession of evil doers and enemies to law and order, and to be in a position at any given moment, to gather in said weapons in order to attain said purpose; and this could not be effected if the possessor or possessors of the weapons could, at their choice, fail to deliver them and pay the penalty to the Government.<br\/><br\/>\"Finally, the case of the The Government of the Philippine Islands <i>vs.<\/i> Graciano Punsalan et al., which was decided by the Supreme Court of these Islands on the 26th of February, 1907, cited by the representative of the plaintiff in order to sustain the theory that, as the defendants had bound themselves unconditionally in the contract, they can not be excused from complying therewith, and consequently from the payment of the bond as indemnity for the damages suffered for the loss of the revolver and cartridges above-mentioned, can 'not serve as a precedent for the decision of the question at bar, because in said case the loss of the rifles was partly due to the negligence of the members of the municipality who had charge of said weapons; said weapons passed into the possession of the bandits who stole them; from this it could not be held that they were lost in the legal sense of the word for the very reason that it was not impossible to recover them, and because their whereabouts could be determined in some manner, while in the present case the revolver and cartridges that were in the hands of the defendant, W. O. Bingham, were totally lost, disappeared and became unsalable, not through his fault but by an act which was independent of his will which he could not foresee or avoid; by a fortuitous event or by an act of<br\/>God; and as it is no longer possible to recover the said articles, the essential purpose of the contract, entered into between him and the Government with respect to the said revolver and cartridges, can not be substantially complied with.<br\/><br\/>\"For the reasons above set forth the court absolves the defendants of the complaint without any special ruling as to the costs.\u00a0 So ordered.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>From this decision the plaintiff appealed, and made the following assignments of error:<br\/><blockquote>\"1.\u00a0 The court erred in not determining the liability of defendants and appellees according to American legal precedents.<br\/><br\/>\"2.\u00a0 The court erred in determining the liability of defendants and appellees under their contract or bond according to the Spanish Civil Code in force in the Philippine Islands.<br\/><br\/>\"3.\u00a0 The court erred in holding and deciding that the obligation of defendants and appellees under their contract or bond was extinguished under the provisions of the' Spanish Civil Code by reason of the fact that the loss of said firearms and ammunition resulted from fortuitous events.<br\/><br\/>\"4.\u00a0 The court erred in holding and deciding that, even under American legal precedents, defendants and appellees would be released from\u00a0 the obligation of their bond by reason of the fact that the firearms and ammunition were lost by act of God.<br\/><br\/>\"5.\u00a0 The court erred in holding and deciding that the essential purpose of the contract or bond of defendants and appellees was to prevent the firearms and ammunition from falling into the hands of wrongdoers, violators of the law, or persons who would use them for some illegal purpose.<br\/><br\/>\"6.\u00a0 The court erred in rendering judgment for defendants and appellees against plaintiff and appellant.<br\/><br\/>\"7.\u00a0 The court erred in denying the motion of plaintiff and appellant to set aside the said judgment and award it anew trial on the ground that said judgment was contrary to law and that the evidence was not sufficient to sustain the decision.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>With reference to the first above assignment of error, it may be noted that the lower court cited both American and Philippine authorities and by following the doctrine of one or of the other, he would have reached the same conclusions.\u00a0 We are at a loss to understand why this particular law (Act No. 652, amending Act No. 175) should be solely construed under American precedents any more than any other law enacted by the legislative department of the Philippine Government.\u00a0 But whether this case is decided by applying American jurisprudence or the laws of the Philippine Islands, we are of the opinion that the result will be the same.\u00a0 Justice is about the same under whatever law.\u00a0 Civilized nations everywhere have adopted about the same rules of justice and law when they relate to fundamental principles affecting the rights of men:\u00a0 The rule of the Shylock-pound-of-flesh is no longer in force\u00a0 where impossibility has prevented the performance of an obligation between men, which impossibility neither of the parties could reasonably anticipate nor prevent.\u00a0 We are of the opinion, and so hold, that the lower court committed no error in applying the jurisprudence which he cites in his decision.\u00a0 This we believe answers both the first and the second assignments of error.<br\/><br\/>The third and fourth assignments of error may be considered together.\u00a0 The obligation which the defendants in their bond assumed was that the said revolver and ammunition should be returned to the plaintiff upon demand of the plaintiff or of its representatives.\u00a0 No demand was made until after\u00a0 the said revolver and ammunition were lost in the\u00a0 manner described in paragraph 4 of the stipulated facts.\u00a0 Said paragraph 4 shows that the revolver and ammunition were lost in about 80 fathoms of water, <i>through no fault of the defendant<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>Article 1182 of the Civil Code provides that-<br\/><blockquote><i>\"An obligation<\/i>, consisting in the delivery of a specified thing,<i> shall be extinguished<\/i> when said thing should be lost or destroyed, without fault of the debtor and before he should be in default.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It\u00a0 would seem that this article\u00a0 was a complete answer to the contention of the plaintiff.\u00a0 (See also decision of the supreme court of Spain of the 18th of February, 1897.)\u00a0 Under article 1183 of said code, the loss shall be presumed to be by the negligence of the person upon whom the obligation rests to return it unless there is proof to the contrary.\u00a0 In the present case it is expressly admitted that there was <i>no fault on the part of the defendants.<\/i><br\/><br\/>Article 1105 of said Civil Code provides that-<br\/><blockquote>\"No one shall be liable for events (speaking of obligations) which\u00a0 could not be foreseen, or which having been foreseen were inevitable, with the exception of the cases expressly mentioned in the law or those in which the obligation so declares.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In the present case there were no exceptions expressly mentioned in the law; neither were there any mentioned in the bond.\u00a0 The loss in the present case was certainly one which, even though it might have been foreseen, was inevitable under the circumstances.<br\/><br\/>There is no doubt but that the general rule is that one who obligates himself to do or not to do a particular thing is obliged to comply with his obligation unless he is relieved by some express exception or stipulation.\u00a0 But this general rule has so many exceptions that in fact it has but little application.\u00a0 The general exception is the one commonly quoted to wit, the act of God or the public enemy.\u00a0 To this, or to these, may be added many others.<br\/><br\/>In the case of Clifford <i>vs.<\/i> Watts (Law Reps., 5 Com. Pleas, 577), Watts undertook to dig from the premises of the plaintiff, and obligated himself under a bond to do so, not less than 1,000 tons\u00a0 of potter's clay annually.\u00a0 There was a default on the part of Watts, and Clifford brought an action against him.\u00a0 Watts pleaded that there never had been so much as 1,000 tons of, clay under the land.\u00a0 The court held that the plea furnished a good answer to the plaintiff's claims.\u00a0 Brett, J., who wrote the opinion, said:\u00a0 \"Both parties might well have supposed that there was clay equal to the amount which the defendant had obligated to dig under the land.\"\u00a0 It was absolutely impossible for the defendant to comply with his obligation, and the mere fact that he was mistaken in the amount of clay which might be dug and the mere fact that he did not make an exception in his contract, were not sufficient to render him liable.<br\/><br\/>Another illustration may be\u00a0 given.\u00a0 Parties may bind themselves in a lawful contract without making any exceptions whatever and be prevented from the performance of the contract by a legal impossibility arising from a change in the law.\u00a0 An impossibility arising in this manner will certainly relieve the parties from their obligations.\u00a0 To illustrate by a specific example:\u00a0 A enters into a contract with B, obligating himself under a bond to construct a dwelling house or other building upon a particular tract of land.\u00a0 Before the construction of the house or building is completed by an act of the legislative department of the government, acting under the law, the land is appropriated under the power of eminent domain for some public purpose thus preventing the contractor from complying with his obligation.\u00a0 The\u00a0 plaintiff sues him for a failure to comply with the conditions of his bond.\u00a0 Will it be contended by any court that, notwithstanding the fact that he <i>had been legally prevented from carrying out his contract<\/i>, he is still liable?\u00a0 Such a conclusion is nauseating to the very idea of justice.<br\/><br\/>A case in point may be found in Baily <i>vs.<\/i> De Crespigny (Law Reps., 4 Q. B., 180); Cordes <i>vs.<\/i> Miller (29\u00a0 Mich., 581); People <i>vs.<\/i> Globe Mutual Life Ins. Co. (91 N. Y., 174); Jamison <i>vs.<\/i> Indiana Natural Gas Co. (128 Ind., 555).<br\/><br\/>There are also other exceptions to the general rule above stated, to-wit:\u00a0 where the existence of a specific thing is essential to the performance of the contract.\u00a0 If the specific thing essential to the performance of the contract is destroyed from no fault of either of the parties, such destruction will operate as a discharge of the parties from their obligation.\u00a0 To illustrate:\u00a0 A rents of B a hall for the purpose of giving a public concert on a particular day.\u00a0 B obligates himself to furnish the hall under a penalty.\u00a0 Before the day for the concert the hall is destroyed by fire, or storm, or earthquake, for which destruction B was in noway responsible.\u00a0 This illustration covers the facts in the present case.\u00a0 Certainly under this contract A could not recover any damages from B for his failure to furnish the hall.\u00a0 (Dexter <i>vs.<\/i> Norton, 47 N. Y., 62; Stewart <i>vs.<\/i> Stone, 127 N. Y., 500; Walker <i>vs.<\/i> Tucker, 70\u00a0 111., 527; \"The Tornado,\" 108 U. S., 342; Cleary <i>vs.<\/i> Sohier, 120 Mass., 210; Butterfield <i>vs.<\/i> Byron, 153 Mass., 517; supreme court of Spain, July 2, 1899; supreme court of Spain, July 8, 1903; Taylor <i>vs.<\/i> Caldwell, 3 B. &amp; S. (Eng. Reps.), 826; Appleby <i>vs.<\/i> Meyers, Law Reps., 2 Com. Pleas, 651.)<br\/><br\/>A further exception to the general rule is in contracts which have for their base the rendering of personal service.\u00a0 Suppose a man should obligate himself in a contract to render some particular personal service and give a bond for the performance of such service, but, before the time arrives for the performance of the\u00a0 obligation, the performer dies.\u00a0 Can the person to whom the obligation runs enforce the bond?\u00a0 This question was presented in the case of Robinson <i>vs.<\/i> Davison (Law Reps., 6 Excheq., 269) and Bramwell, J., in answering the question said (p. 277):<br\/><blockquote>\"This is a contract to perform a service which no deputy could perform and which, in case of death, could not be performed by the\u00a0 executors of the deceased, and I am of opinion that by virtue of the terms of the original bargain incapacity of body or mind in the performer, <i>without default on his part,<\/i> is an excuse for nonperformance.\u00a0 The contract must in my judgment be taken to have been conditional and not absolute.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>So also may an unforeseen peril, as a general conflagration or inundation, or the prevalence of a contagious disease, and many other things which can not be avoided, work a discharge and a release from an absolute obligation fixed in a contract.\u00a0 (Lakeman <i>vs.<\/i> Pollard, 43 Me., 463.)<br\/><br\/>With reference to the fifth above assignment of error, we find that the court committed no error in his statement as to the purpose of the bond in question.\u00a0 That was a mere opinion, and in our judgment did not influence the conclusions of the court.<br\/><br\/>We deem it unnecessary to discuss the assignments of error numbered six and seven.<br\/><br\/>In the foregoing conclusions we have not overlooked the decisions of this court in the case of The Government of the Philippine Islands <i>vs.<\/i> Punzalan et al.\u00a0 (7 PhiL Rep., 546), and the case of The Government of the Philippine Islands<i> vs.<\/i> Amechazurra et al.\u00a0 (10 Phil. Rep., 637).\u00a0 Neither is it intended herein to overrule those decisions.\u00a0 There is no reason why those decisions should not be followed when the facts are as the facts were in those cases.\u00a0 In the present case it was admitted by both parties that the impossibility on the part of the defendant to comply with the terms of his bond was caused <i>through no fault of the said defendant<\/i>.\u00a0 In the case of Punzalan et al., this court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"There is evidence of record tending to show that there was more or less negligence in the performance of their duties as municipal officials on the part of some, if not all, of the defendants, which may have contributed to the loss of these arms.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In the case of Amechazurra there is no reference in detail to conditions under which the firearms in question were lost, but inasmuch as the court followed the doctrine in the cause of Punzalan, it is to be presumed that the facts were the same substantially.<br\/><br\/>For all of the foregoing reasons we are of the opinion, and so hold, that the judgment of the court below should be affirmed, with costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

he further stated that he had had no quarrel with the assaulted persons.<br\/><br\/>From the statements made by the accused his culpability as the sole-confessed and self-convicted author of the crime in question has been unquestionably established, nor can his allegation that he acted by order of Datto Mupuck and that therefore he was not responsible exculpate him, because it was not a matter of proper obedience.\u00a0 The excuse that he went <i>juramentado<\/i> by order of the said datto and on that account killed only two persons, whereas if he had taken the oath of his own volition he would have killed many more, because it is the barbarous and savage custom of a <i>juramentado<\/i> to kill anyone without any motive or reason whatever, can not under any consideration be accepted or considered under the laws of civilized nations; such exhibitions of ferocity and savagery must be restrained, especially as the very people who up to the present time have been practicing such acts are well aware that the established authorities in this country can never allow them to go unpunished, and as has happened a number of times in towns where <i>juramentados<\/i> are in the habit of appearing, the punishment of the author has followed every crime so committed.<br\/><br\/>In the commission of the crime of murder the presence of aggravating circumstances 3 and 7 of article 10 of the Penal Code should be taken into consideration in that promise of reward and premeditation are present, which in the present case are held to be generic, since the crime\" has already been qualified as committed with treachery, because the accused confessed that he voluntarily obeyed the order given him by Datto Mupuck to go <i>juramentado<\/i> and kill some one in the town of Cotabato, with the promise that if he escaped punishment he would be rewarded with a pretty woman.\u00a0 Upon complying with the order the accused undoubtedly\u00a0 acted of his own volition and with the knowledge that he would inflict irreparable injury on some of his fellow-beings, depriving them of life without any reason whatever, well knowing that he was about to commit a most serious deed which the laws in force in this country and the constituted authorities could by no means permit.\u00a0 Datto Mupuck, who ordered and induced him to commit the crimes, as well as the accused knew perfectly well that he might be caught and punished in the act of committing them.<br\/><br\/>As to the other circumstance it is also unquestionable that the accused, upon accepting the order and undertaking the journey in order to comply therewith, deliberately considered and carefully and thoughtfully meditated over the nature and the consequences of the acts which, under orders received from the said datto, he was\u00a0 about to carry out, and to that end provided himself with a weapon, concealing it by wrapping it up, and started on a journey of a day and a night for the sole purpose of taking the life of two unfortunate persons whom he did not know, and with whom he had never had any trouble,; nor did there exist any reason which, to a certain extent, might warrant his perverse deed.\u00a0 The fact that the arrangement between the instigator and the tool considered the killing of unknown persons, the first encountered, does not bar the consideration of the circumstance of premeditation.\u00a0 The nature and the circumstances which characterize the crime, the perversity of the culprit, and the material and moral injury are the same, and the fact that the victim was not predetermined does not affect nor alter the nature of the crime.\u00a0 The person having been deprived of his life by deeds executed with deliberate intent, the crime is considered a premeditated one as the firm and persistent intention of the accused from the moment, before said death, when he received the order until the crime was committed is manifestly evident.\u00a0 Even though in a crime committed upon offer of money, reward or promise, premeditation is sometimes present, the latter not being inherent in the former, and there existing no incompatibility between the two, premeditation can not\u00a0 necessarily be considered as included merely because an offer of money, reward or promise was made, for the latter might have existed without the former, the one being independent of the other.\u00a0 In the present case there can be no doubt that after the crime was agreed upon by means of a promise of reward, the criminal by his subsequent conduct showed a persistency and firm intent in his plan to carry out the crime which he intentionally agreed to execute, it being immaterial whether Datto Mupuck did or did not conceive the crime, once Manalinde obeyed the inducement and voluntarily executed it.<br\/><br\/>The facts in this case are quite different from those in the proceedings instituted by the United States<i> vs.<\/i> Caranto et al., wherein the decision on page 256 of Volume IV of the Philippine Reports was rendered, as may be seen from the mere perusal of the statement of facts.\u00a0 It is also different from the case where a criminal who has made up his mind to kill a certain individual kills a person other than the object of his criminal intent.\u00a0 On going to Cotabato the Moro Manalinde intended to and did kill the first two persons he encountered, and the fact that the Victim was not predetermined does not alter the nature, conditions, or circumstances of the crime, for the reason that to cause the violent death of a human being without any reasonable motive is always punishable with a more or less grave penalty according to the nature of the concurrent circumstances.<br\/><br\/>For the above reasons and in view of the fact that no mitigating\u00a0 circumstance is present to neutralize the effects of the aggravating ones, it is our opinion that the judgment appealed from should be affirmed with costs, provided however, that the penalty imposed on the culprit shall be executed in accordance with the provisions of Acts Nos. 451 and 1577, and that in the event of a pardon being granted he shall likewise be sentenced to suffer the accessory penalties imposed by article 53 of the Penal Code.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

that from that time he remained in possession and cultivated the land until 1906, and that he paid the taxes thereon.\u00a0 In 1906 the defendant again entered upon the land and is now in possession thereof.,<br\/><br\/>There is no evidence to contradict the testimony of the plaintiff to the effect that the land was delivered to him in 1901 by the defendant and that he remained in possession thereof until 1906.\u00a0 His testimony as to the nature of the contract made between himself and the defendant in 1891 is corroborated by the testimony of three witnesses who state that in 1905 they were present when the defendant executed and delivered to the plaintiff a document called a counter-receipt, wherein it was stated that the plaintiff had delivered the money to the defendant and had asked for the return of the document and that the defendant had stated that he could not return it because it had been burned and for that reason he made this additional document.\u00a0 There was nothing to contradict the testimony of these three witnesses except the bare statement of the defendant that he did not go in 1905 to the house where the three witnesses testified that the document was executed.\u00a0 A continuance was granted to enable the plaintiff to produce this counter-receipt, which he did on the day to which the case was thus continued.\u00a0 It purports to be signed by the defendant and the three witnesses who testified that they had so signed it and its contents are in exact conformity with what was testified to by these witnesses.\u00a0 It is suggested by the defendant that the document was not exhibited to the witnesses and they did not identify their signatures.\u00a0 This is true.\u00a0 But we think the contract evidenced by this receipt was sufficiently proven.<br\/><br\/>With these facts appearing, the judgment for the defendant can not be sustained.\u00a0 It is not important to determine exactly the nature of the interest which the plaintiff had in the land in 1891 when he turned it over to the defendant, because it is established to our satisfaction that whatever interest the defendant ever acquired in the land he acquired by the contract then made between himself and the plaintiff and that this interest, thus acquired, the defendant, after the lapse of ten years, and in 1901, transferred again to the plaintiff, thereby divesting himself of all right or claim to the property.\u00a0 It is said by the defendant in his brief that the transaction between the plaintiff and the defendant in 1891 constituted a sale with the right to repurchase; that no time having been fixed for the repurchase it must, according to the law then in force, have been made within four years, and that period having elapsed without any repurchase, the title became vested absolutely in the defendant.\u00a0 Even if this claim were true, it would in no way benefit the defendant, for although he were the absolute owner of the property in 1901, he had a perfect right to deal with it as he saw fit.\u00a0 He had a right to resell the land to the plaintiff on such terms as the two might agree upon.\u00a0 That the parties did agree upon a resale, and that such resale was in fact made, we think is fully established by the evidence.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below is reversed and judgment is entered for the plaintiff as prayed for in his complaint, with the costs of the first instance.\u00a0 No costs will be allowed to either party in this court.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

he also alleged that one of the heirs, Vicente Sola, widower of Gregoria Arbes, deceased, married the plaintiff; that plaintiff's claim to an interest in the property in question is or should be strictly limited to the interest which she is entitled to take from her husband, since deceased; and that while it is true that she and her husband exercised certain rights of possession of the land in question, they never had exclusive possession, and such rights of possession as they did exercise were exercised not only on their own behalf but on half of all the heirs of Gregoria Arbes.<br\/><br\/>Upon these pleadings the parties went to trial, and plaintiff introduced evidence tending to prove that the land in question was originally the property of her husband, Vicente Sola, acquired by him, not from his first wife, Gregoria Arbes, but by purchase, in part prior to, and in part after his marriage with his first wife; she also introduced in evidence a document, dated January 31, 1887, purporting to be a partition agreement between her husband Sola, and the other heirs of Gregoria Arbes who died a short time prior to the execution of the instrument, whereby the land in question was assigned to Sola as his property.\u00a0 Plaintiff further introduced testimony which clearly established her allegation that from the date of that instrument until the time when defendant took possession of the land, she and her husband had had the exclusive possession thereof.<br\/><br\/>Defendant did not deny the execution of the partition agreement, and wholly failed to prove that the land in question was or is a part of the estate of Gregoria Arbes, deceased, or to establish his allegation that plaintiff and her husband were not in the exclusive possession of the land in question from the date of its execution to the time when he took possession as administrator, or that they held possession thereof jointly with the other heirs of Gregoria Arbes.\u00a0 He insisted, however, that the agreement was not binding upon the heirs of Gregoria Arbes, because at the date of its execution two of them, a niece and a nephew, were minors and incapable of executing such a document, although it appears that they were represented upon that occasion by their respective fathers who married sisters of Gregoria Arbes, and signed the instrument as the legal representatives of these minor heirs.<br\/><br\/>The trial court on the pleadings and proof submitted at the trial found that the plaintiff was entitled to the possession of the land in question, and rendered final judgment in accordance with the prayer of the complaint, granting a final injunction perpetually restraining the defendant administrator from continuing in possession of the land in question or enjoying the fruits thereof.<br\/><br\/>We are in entire accord with the trial judge as to his findings of fact, and agree with him that the evidence of record establishes plaintiff's right of possession in and to the lands in question:\u00a0 for without deciding whether the extrajudicial partition agreement between the heirs of Gregoria Arbes, deceased, executed in 1887, conveyed to plaintiff's deceased husband the absolute right of ownership in the land assigned to him thereby; or whether that agreement, which was executed before the present Code of Civil Procedure went into effect, can be successfully attacked at this time by the minor heirs, because of the apparent lack of judicial approbation of the action of their legal representatives; it is sufficient, for the purposes of this decision, to point out that plaintiff, and her husband having been in exclusive possession of this land, under a claim based on the partition agreement, for more than fifteen years, the defendant, in his capacity of administrator, had no lawful authority to take possession thereof without plaintiff's consent, in the absence of a final judgment of a competent court securing to him his alleged right of possession; and that defendant having failed to prove that the estate of which he is administrator is the true owner of all or any part of the land in question, the plaintiff is entitled to be replaced in possession.<br\/><br\/>We are of opinion, however, that the remedy by injunction sought by the plaintiff and allowed by the trial court was not the proper remedy for the cause of action set out in the pleadings and established by the evidence, and that, in accordance with the provisions of section 126 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the court should have granted \"relief consistent with the case made by the complaint and supported by the evidence and embraced within the issue,\" and to that end should have required an amendment of the complaint by striking out the prayer for an injunction and substituting therefor a prayer for judgment for possession of the land described in the complaint, and upon the complaint thus amended, judgment should have been rendered in favor of the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>Both the parties to this action appear to have labored under a misapprehension as to the purpose, scope, and limitations of the special remedy, known as an injunction, and defined in section 162 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u00a0 The records in many cases in this court disclose a considerable degree of doubt and uncertainty in the minds of counsel as to the function of this remedy, and in some cases a wholly erroneous concept of the purpose and object for which it is provided.\u00a0 This erroneous concept may, perhaps, be due to the fact that in the Spanish version of the new Code of Civil Procedure, the term injunction is translated <i>interdicto prohibitorio<\/i>, which may thus have, given rise to the impression that the remedy by injunction is similar in character to the summary <i>interdictal actions<\/i> of the Spanish procedural law; but while the injunction resembles in many respects the interdicto of the Roman law, especially the decretal <i>(decretale, quod praetor re nata implorantibus decrevit<\/i>), and while it also resembles to a certain degree in its operation and effect, the <i>interdictos de adquirir, de retener<\/i>, and <i>de recobrar<\/i> or <i>de despojo<\/i> of the Spanish procedural law; nevertheless, it is wholly distinct therefrom, and, as a rule, the circumstances under which, in accordance with the former\u00a0 procedural law, these <i>interdictos<\/i> properly issued, would not justify nor sustain the issuance of an injunction, as defined and provided in the new Code of Civil Procedure.\u00a0 An injunction is a \"special remedy\" adopted in that code from American practice, and originally borrowed from English legal procedure, which was there issued by the authority and under the seal of a court of equity, and limited, as in other cases where equitable relief is sought, to cases where there is no \"plain, adequate, and complete remedy at law\" (30 Barb., 549; 5 R. L, 472; 121 N. Y., 46; 31 Pa., 387; 32 Ala., N. S., 723; 37 N, H., 254; 61 Hun., 140; 145 U. S., 459; 141 III., 572; 49 Fed. Rep., 517; 37 id., 67; 34 id., 357; 129 Md., 464; 109 N. C., 21; 83 Wis., 426; 115 Mo., 613), which \"will not be granted while the rights between the parties are undetermined, except in extraordinary cases where material and irreparable injury will be done,\" which can not be compensated in damages, and where there will be no adequate remedy (3 Bosw., 607; 1 Beasl., 247, 542; 15 Md., 22; 13 Cal., 156, 190; 6 Wis., 680; 16 Tex., 410; 28 Mo., 210; 24 Fla., 542; 39 N. H., 182; 12 Cush., 410; 27 Ga., 499; 1 McAll, 271; 54 Fed. Rep., 1005; 64 Vt., 643), and which will not, as a rule, be granted, to take property out of the possession of one party and put it into that of another whose title has not been established by law.\u00a0 (144 U. S., 119; 40 W. N. C. Pa., 121.)<br\/><br\/>This court has frequently held, when treating of the special remedies by injunction, mandamus and prohibition, which are provided in the now Code of Procedure in Civil Cases, that the accepted American doctrine limiting the use of these remedies to cases where there is no other adequate remedy, and otherwise controlling the issuance of these writs, and must be deemed to limit their use in like manner in this jurisdiction, when not otherwise provided by law:\u00a0 to hold otherwise would be to render practically of no effect the various provisions of the code touching many if not most of the ordinary\u00a0 actions, and the enforcement of judgment in such actions; for it may well be supposed that if a complainant could secure relief by injunction in every case where \"the defendant is doing or threatens or is about to do, or is procuring or suffering to be done, some act probably in violation of the plaintiff's rights\" and could enforce the judgment granting the injunction by the summary contempt proceedings authorized in section 172 of the code to punish violations of injunctions, he would seldom elect to enforce his rights in such cases by the ordinary remedies, involving as they do the difficult and ofttimes fruitless labor of enforcing judgments obtained therein by execution.\u00a0 But so many cases have come before us where preliminary injunctions have been issued apparently without regard to this rule, that we are satisfied that the erroneous impression still prevails, in some quarters, that a preliminary injunction\u00a0 <i>must<\/i> issue where a <i>prima facie<\/i> showing is made of the existence of the circumstances under which such injunctions <i>may<\/i> be granted as set out in section 164 of the Code of Civil Procedure, without keeping in mind the fact that applications for injunctions are made to the sound discretion of the court, and that the exercise of that discretion is controlled by the accepted doctrines touching:\u00a0 the granting of injunctions in such cases; and we may add that the records also disclose a dangerous tendency to grant permanent injunctions on\u00a0 insufficient grounds, as a result of a similar erroneous\u00a0 construction of the provisions of the code in that regard.<br\/><br\/>No brief was filed by plaintiff on appeal, and the contentions of the parties in the court below are not very clearly set out in the very short brief of the defendant and appellant.\u00a0 It appears, however, that defendant challenged the jurisdiction of the trial court, on the ground that the summary interdictal actions of the Spanish procedural law have been done away with by the provisions of the new Code of Procedure in Civil Cases, the <i>interdicto de recobrar or de despojo<\/i> having been expressly displaced by the summary remedies prescribed in section 80 of the new code, for the recovery of lands or buildings of which one is deprived by force, intimidation, fraud, or strategy within a year prior to the institution of the action; and defendant insists that the action instituted by plaintiff, while in form a proceeding praying for an injunction under the new code, assimilated to the former proceeding praying for an <i>interdicto de recobrar<\/i> or <i>de despojo<\/i>, is in fact an action which could only be maintained under the provisions of section 80 of the new code, of which original jurisdiction is conferred upon the courts of the justice of the peace, exclusive of the Court of First Instance.\u00a0 Plaintiff and appellee on the other hand seems to have insisted that the injunction proceedings instituted by her were assimilated rather to the summary action known as the <i>interdicto de retener<\/i> and that the facts alleged and proven establishing her right to an <i>interdicto de retener<\/i>, under the old law, she is entitled to an injunction under the new code, that remedy being the equivalent provided by the new code for the <i>interdicto<\/i> of the old law.<br\/><br\/>But while we agree with defendant and appellant that the summary remedies provided in section 80 may be said to replace and perhaps abrogate the old <i>interdicto de recobrar<\/i> or <i>de despojo<\/i>, and that if the facts alleged and proven made out a cause of action under that section and, therefore, within the exclusive jurisdiction of the court of the justice of the peace, it would be necessary to hold that the trial court was wholly without original jurisdiction; and while we can not agree with the plaintiff and appellee that the facts set out in the pleadings and evidence would support the issuance of an <i>interdicto de retener<\/i>, even under the former procedure, because possession of the land and buildings had been actually lost to plaintiff when the action was instituted, nor can we agree with her that even if a proper case for the granting of an <i>interdicto de retener<\/i> under the old procedure had been established, it necessarily follows that an injunction should issue under the new procedure; and without deciding whether all the summary interdictal remedies of the Spanish law have been wholly and in all cases abolished under the provisions of the new code, it is sufficient for the purpose of this decision to hold that since there is nothing in the allegations or proof to show that defendant obtained possession of the land in question by force, intimidation, fraud, or strategy, the action is not in the nature of the summary remedy known to the old law as an <i>interdicto de recobrar<\/i> or <i>de despojo<\/i>, nor is it the summary remedy of forcible entry and wrongful detainer provided in section 80 of the new code, and therefore\u00a0 it does not fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the court of the justice of the peace, to the exclusion of the Court of First Instance, which tried the case.<br\/><br\/>What has been said disposes of all the errors assigned by appellant, except his\u00a0 assignment of error based on his contention\u00a0 that the administrator having taken possession as an officer of the court wherein the estate was being administered, his conduct in that regard should not be questioned, except in the course of\u00a0 the administration proceedings.<br\/><br\/>We have frequently held that a contested claim of an administrator that certain rights of possession and ownership are the property of the estate which he represents must be determined in a separate action, and not in the course of the administration proceedings; and it should not be necessary to add that the mere fact that an administrator holds letters of appointment from some court, in nowise authorizes him to take possession of property held by another under a claim of a right to possession until and unless he successfully establishes his right to possession\u00a0 of such property in a proper proceeding in a competent court.<br\/><br\/>Ten days from the date of this decision let judgment be entered, reversing the judgment of the trial court and dissolving the preliminary and permanent injunctions issued therein, without costs to either party in this instance, and ten days thereafter let the record be returned to the court below where, upon the amendment of the complaint along the lines therein indicated, judgment will be rendered in favor of the plaintiff tor the possession of the lands described in the complaint, together with the costs in the Court of First Instance, but without damages, which were not satisfactorily established by the evidence of record.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.J., Torres<\/i> and <i>Johnson, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><i>Willard, J<\/i>., concurs in the result.<br\/><\/div>",

In construing this legal provision this court has held and established in case No. 1708, <i>Ex parte<\/i> Pedro Arcenas et al.\u00a0 (4 Phil. Rep., 700), that \"where a testator does not know how, or is unable for any reason, to sign the will himself, it shall be signed in the following manner:\u00a0 <i>'John Doe, by the testator, Richard Roe;' or in this form:\u00a0 'By the testator, John Doe, Richard Roe: \"<\/i><br\/><br\/>This last form is precisely the one which has been used in the will in question, with the exception of the words <i>the testator <\/i>which were omitted.\u00a0 It is unnecessary to say that such omission does not nor can it in anyway affect the validity of the will, because the essential thing is the name of the testator, which name, we hold, was duly written in the aforesaid will.<br\/><br\/>The order appealed from is reversed, and the will is hereby declared valid and ordered admitted to probate.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

VICENTE LAVIN, CLAIMANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>WILLARD, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">In the\u00a0 proceedings for the settlement of the intestate estate of Joaquina Mijares de Fari\u00f1as, deceased, the heirs of Paulino Lavin presented before the commissioners two claims against the estate, one for a debt claimed to be due from Jose Fari\u00f1as, the husband of the deceased, to Paulino Lavin, which debt it was said had been assumed by the deceased, and the other for a debt due from the deceased herself to Paulino Lavin.\u00a0 The commissioners disallowed both claims, the heirs appealed to the Court of First Instance, which court allowed the debt claimed to be due from the husband and disallowed the debt claimed to be due from the deceased herself.\u00a0 From\u00a0 this judgment both parties have appealed.<br\/><br\/>1.\u00a0 If Jose Fari\u00f1as, the husband of the deceased, owed anything to Paulino Lavin, it was by reason of two documents, both dated the 17th day of March, 1886.\u00a0 They are substantially in the same form.\u00a0 One of them is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Received from Don Paulino Lavin the sum of nine hundred and seventy-one pesos invested in the work on the <i>Tribunal de Santa Catalina<\/i>, as capitalist partner of the undersigned.<br\/><br\/>\"Vigan, March 17, 1886.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: right;\">(Signed)\u00a0 \"JOSE FARl\u00d1AS.\"<br\/><\/div><\/blockquote>The other obligation was for 200 pesos, making a total of 1,171 pesos.\u00a0 There was proof other than that contained in the documents themselves to show that Paulino Lavin and Jose Fari\u00f1as were partners in the\u00a0 construction of certain public buildings in Ilocos Sur.\u00a0 These documents do not evidence any indebtedness on the part of Fari\u00f1as to Lavin.\u00a0 They prove rather, that Lavin had contributed certain money to the business of the partnership, and whether he ever received the money would depend upon the success of the business, a result which could only be known after a liquidation of the partnership affairs.\u00a0 There is no evidence that any such liquidation was ever made and no evidence that, even if such liquidation had been made and profits had resulted, that these profits were in the hands of Fari\u00f1as.<br\/><br\/>But it is said that notwithstanding this fact, the deceased admitted that these documents showed the existence of a debt on the part of her husband, the payment of which she assumed.\u00a0 Her husband died on the 16th day of October, 1888.\u00a0 On the 30th of May, 1889, she made and signed the following indorsement upon each one of the documents:<br\/><blockquote>\"I acknowledge as true the contents of the foregoing receipt, as I was present at the time when the amount therein stated was actually delivered and at the time when my late husband signed it with his own hand; and in testimony thereof, I sign this acknowledgment before the witnesses Don Raymundo Querol, Don Ladislao Donato, and Don Narciso Sebastian.<br\/><br\/>\"Vigan, May 30,1889.\" <\/blockquote> It will be seen that this document signed by her is simply a recognition of the truth of the statements contained in the document itself, namely, that Paulino Lavin had contributed to the capital of the partnership certain sums of money.\u00a0 It does not even admit the existence of any debt from the husband to Paulino Lavin and in no way assumes the payment of any such supposed obligation.<br\/><br\/>It follows, therefore, that when in 1894 the heirs of Paulino Lavin\u00a0 commenced an action against the deceased she was in no way responsible for this debt supposed to exist in favor of the heirs and against her husband.\u00a0 It is claimed, however, by the plaintiffs that in the proceedings in that action she recognized the existence of such a debt.\u00a0 That proceeding was an executive action commenced on the 10th day of October, 1894, against the deceased.\u00a0 The document set out in the complaint purported to be signed by the deceased and it stated that after the death of her husband, Jose Fari\u00f1as, she had received from Paulino Lavin 1,233.14 pesos.\u00a0 In the proceeding she was required to state:\u00a0 (1) Whether she admitted the truth of the contents of the documents; and (2) whether her signature thereto was genuine.\u00a0 Her answer was as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"She stated that she acknowledged the contents of the document shown to her, because it is true that her late husband Don Jose Fari\u00f1as received from Don Paulino Lavin the sum of twelve hundred and thirty-three pesos and fourteen cents therein referred to; in answering the second question, she said that she did not acknowledge the signature and rubric, appearing with her name in\u00a0 the above-mentioned document, as she did not\u00a0 remember signing a sealed document, nor having done so in the presence of the witnesses whose signatures and rubric appear at the foot of the same.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It will be seen that she did not understand the document, or that her answer was not properly taken down.\u00a0 In fact, in a subsequent proceeding in the case it was alleged by her that there had been a mistake in this respect, for the document, the truth of which she admitted, says nothing about any debt due from her husband to Paulino Lavin.\u00a0 On the contrary, it relates solely to her own personal debt incurred after her husband's death.\u00a0 It is to be noticed further that in this answer she did not say that her husband owed Paulino Lavin, but that he had taken a certain amount of money from him.\u00a0 This is entirely consistent with the contents of the documents of the 17th of March, 1886.\u00a0 There is, consequently, nothing in this answer which admits the existence of any indebtedness from her husband to Paulino Lavin and nothing which showed that she assumed the payment of any such supposed indebtedness.<br\/><br\/>Later in the proceedings an answer was presented in her behalf.\u00a0 In this answer she stated that what she declared when asked to recognize the authenticity of the documents was that her deceased husband owed Lavin 1,171 pesos and not 1,233 pesos.\u00a0 It does not appear that she signed this answer.\u00a0 It may have been signed by her solicitor.\u00a0 Under these circumstances the contents of the answer can not be considered as admissions made by her which could\u00a0 be used as evidence against her in another proceeding entirely disconnected with the subject-matter of the proceeding in which the answer was made.\u00a0 There is, therefore, nothing in the proceeding of 1894 which proves either the existence of a debt from the husband Paulino Lavin or any recognition of such supposed indebtedness by the deceased.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff claims, however, that there is such recognition and admission in the will of the deceased made on the 20th of January, 1906.\u00a0 This supposed will contains the following statement:<br\/><blockquote>\"I also declare that at the time of the death of my husband he left unfinished a work under contract with the Government, in the pueblo of Santa Maria, and in order to fulfill the obligation of my husband I had to continue the work until its termination, with such ill fortune that I lost about 2,000 pesos.\u00a0 For the purpose of covering the loss, I borrowed some money from Bon Vicente Lavin, to whom I still owe P1,300, and from the nephews of Father Evaristo Abaya P540, all of them residents of Vigan, and I also sold the parcel,of land in Pantay above cited.\" <\/blockquote> It will be seen that this contains no admission of the existence of any debt from her husband to Paulino Lavin.\u00a0 It relates exclusively to a personal debt contracted by her after his death.\u00a0 It is not, therefore, necessary to consider the effect of this supposed will which was not admitted to probate because it never was signed by the deceased.<br\/><br\/>The result as to this cause of action is that there is no evidence in the case to show any liability on the part of the estate of the deceased for the payment of this 1,171 pesos, and the judgment of the court below allowing this claim must be reversed.<br\/><br\/>2.\u00a0 The other cause of action relates to a personal debt contracted by the deceased after the death of her husband.<br\/><br\/>There was received in evidence a statement of the accounts between Paulino Lavin and the deceased commencing in November, 1888, and ending in April, 1889, dated the 30th day of May, 1889, signed by Paulino Lavin, from which it appeared that the deceased owed Paulino Lavin 1,233.14 pesos.\u00a0 The deceased by a writing signed upon the account itself agreed to its correctness.<br\/><br\/>This document proves the existence of a debt of that amount upon that date and the only question in the case is, whether the statute of limitations has run against this indebtedness.<br\/><br\/>The action Commenced by the heirs of Paulino Lavin in 1894 was an action to recover this same indebtedness.\u00a0 It is true that that proceeding, being an executive action, was dismissed on the ground that the plaintiff had not presented any document.which entitled him to take advantage of such a summary proceeding but when the question of the interruption of the running of the statute of limitations in regard to actions is under consideration the fact that the action is dismissed is of no importance.\u00a0 Article 1973 of the Civil Code is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Prescription of actions is interrupted by their institution before the courts, by extrajudicial claim of the creditor, and by any act of acknowledgment of the debt by the debtor.\" <\/blockquote> (See Manresa's Commentaries on the Civil Code, Vol 12, page 883.)<br\/><br\/>The result is that the judgment of the court below refusing to allow this claim must be reversed and it should be allowed in the amount of 1,233.14 pesos, with interest at the rate of 6 per cent per annum from the 10th day of October, 1894, when a judicial demand for its payment was made.<br\/><br\/>3.\u00a0 The person who carried on this litigation in the Court of First Instance and in this court is Vicente Lavin, the judicial administrator of the estate of his father, Paulino Lavin.\u00a0 The persons who presented the claim before the commissioners were the\u00a0 heirs of Paulino Lavin and the defendant claims that the plaintiff as administrator has no standing in court because he never presented any claim before the commissioners.\u00a0 It appears that Vicente Lavin was appointed judicial administrator of the estate of Paulino Lavin on the 5th day of March, 1907.\u00a0 This was after the claim had been presented by the heirs to the commissioners.\u00a0 The question involved is simply one of substitution of parties plaintiff.\u00a0 Upon the appointment of Vicente Lavin as administrator as aforesaid he was entitled to have and receive all the claims in favor of the estate of which he was the administrator and entitled to be substituted in the place of the heirs in the prosecution of any such claims.\u00a0 The objection of the defendant, therefore, to his personality can not be sustained.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below is reversed and judgment entered acquitting the defendant of the second cause of action set out in the complaint and ordering judgment against the defendant and in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of P1,233.14, with interest at the rate of 6 per cent per annum from the 10th day of October, 1894, and the costs of the first instance.\u00a0 No costs will be allowed to either party in this court.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Smith, Governor-General, commuted said sentence, by reducing the same to a term of imprisonment of six years \"conditioned upon his good behavior for five years subsequent to his release, and further conditioned that\u00a0 during said period he report in person or by sworn statement, setting forth his place of residence and occupation to the Director of Constabulary and chief of police, city of Manila, and also to the provincial governor, and the senior inspector of Constabulary of the province in which he is residing; such reports to be made on the first days of January, May, and September of each year, or oftener, if required by the Governor-General.\u00a0 Should the conditions of this commutation be violated, the unexpired portion of his sentence will remain in full force and effect.\u00a0 Juan Toledo will be released from confinement upon the conditions above stated, when he shall have actually served six years' imprisonment, to wit, on February 26,1910.\"<br\/><br\/>On the 5th day of December, 1908, the said Juan Toledo presented a petition in the Supreme Court praying that a writ of habeas corpus be granted him.\u00a0 The principal ground of said petition is that the defendant is not being given the benefit of Act No. 1533 of the Philippine Commission, which is \"An Act providing for the diminution of sentences imposed upon prisoners convicted of any offense and sentenced for a definite term of more than thirty days, and less than life, in consideration of good conduct and<br\/>diligence.\"\u00a0 Said Act (No. 1533) provides for the diminution of sentences of prisoners for good conduct as follows:<br\/><br\/>(<i>a<\/i>)\u00a0 During the first two years of imprisonment, providing that his conduct justifies it, a deduction of five days for each month, from the period of his sentence.<br\/><br\/>(<i>b<\/i>)\u00a0 After he has served two full years of his sentence, the deduction shall be eight days for each month.<br\/><br\/>(<i>c<\/i>)\u00a0 After he has served five full years of\u00a0 his sentence, the deduction shall be ten days for each month.<br\/>\u00a0<br\/>(<i>d<\/i>)\u00a0 After he has served ten full years of his sentence, the deduction from his term shall be fifteen days for each month.\u00a0 The term month, as used in this Act is defined in Act No. 1559 to mean thirty days.<br\/><br\/>The pretension of the petitioner is that the Governor-General having commuted his sentence to a period of six years and he having served, allowing for good time, a period of six years, he is entitled to his liberty.\u00a0 The petitioner overlooks the fact that the Governor reduced the period of imprisonment to six years, but expressly fixed the date upon which period of imprisonment should expire, to wit, February 26, 1910.<br\/><br\/>There is no question raised\u00a0 with reference to the power of the Governor to pardon.\u00a0 See letter of January 3, 1903, of Elihu Root, then Secretary of War, to Hon. William H. Taft, Civil Governor of the Philippine Islands, which letter contains the following\u00a0 paragraph:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"The Civil Governor of the Philippine Islands is authorized to exercise the power to grant pardons, reprieves, and commutations of sentences in cases involving offenses against the laws of the Civil Government of the Philippine Islands.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>Said letter also contains the following paragraphs:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"The Civil Governor in exercising said authority shall act 'by authority of the President of the United States.'<br\/><br\/>\"All pardons granted by the Civil Governor shall be reported to the Secretary of War for presentation to the President.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>The Governor-General having the power to pardon, reprieve, or to commute the sentence, had the power to make such pardon, reprieve, or commutation absolute or conditional.<br\/><br\/>It is contended that the Governor had no authority to fix the day upon which the term of imprisonment should expire, for the reason that he thereby prevented the applicant from securing the benefits of said Act\u00a0 No. 1533, or, in other words, that the Governor-General, by fixing the day for the termination of the sentence violated or set\u00a0 side the provisions of said Act (No. 1533.)<br\/><br\/>In my opinion this contention is\u00a0 not tenable.\u00a0 The\u00a0 Governor-General; in granting a pardon such as was granted in the present case, no more violates the provisions of the law nor prevents the operation of the provisions of the law, in the present case, than he does in any case when he pardons a man, for instance, who was sentenced for life, because the law, the Spanish Penal Code, in each case fixes the penalty which must be imposed under certain facts.\u00a0 For example, under certain facts, criminals must be sentenced to death, and the courts have no discretion in the imposition of such penalty.\u00a0 No one questions the right of the Governor-General to commute the death sentence imposed, to a sentence for life or to an absolute pardon.\u00a0 No one hitherto has even suggested that the Governor-General, in exercising the pardoning power in this way, had attempted to set aside the law.\u00a0 He simply exercised a power of sovereignty confided in him.<br\/><br\/>The application for the writ of <i>habeas corpus<\/i> should be denied.<br\/><br\/><br\/><hr align=\"left\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1] <\/sup>Not reported.<\/div>",

No. 5108, September 30, 1909<\/h2>\n<h3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, <i>VS.<\/i> NICOMEDES MORALES, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>ARELLANO, C.J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">Under the provisions of section 55 of the Internal Revenue Law, Act No. 1189, the Court of First Instance of Albay sentenced Nicomedes Morales to one year and one day's imprisonment, and to pay a fine of P2,000, or, in case of insolvency, to suffer subsidiary imprisonment at the rate of one day for every P2.50 that he failed to pay, not to exceed six months, and did not sentence him to pay the costs.<br\/><br\/>The accused has appealed from the said sentence, and his appeal having been heard by this court it appears that the judgment appealed from contains the following findings of fact:<br\/><br\/>That, on the 12th of March, 1908, Nicomedes Morales, in his capacity of councilor, ordered the lieutenant of his district to warn the residents thereof of the necessity of providing themselves with a cedula corresponding to said year, but that those who did not possess the same for the years 1906 and 1907, should be sent to him; the order was obeyed by the said lieutenant, and on the 15th of the same month of March four individuals, among whom was Paulino Esperanza, were sent to him.<br\/><br\/>That Paulino Esperanza, when he appeared before Councilor Morales, after demand had been made upon him for the value of the cedulas for 1907 and 1908, paid down P4, Morales promising to take out for him the cedulas for 1907 and 1908.<br\/><br\/>That Morales went to the municipal treasury of Albay on the 16th of March with a list of the persons for whom he asked cedulas, Paulino Esperanza appearing among the same as of 42 years of age.<br\/><br\/>That the clerk whose duty it was to issue cedulas, made out one for Paulino\u00a0 Esperanza entering on it and on the stub the age of 42 years.<br\/><br\/>That before issuing the cedula, the clerk requested Councilor Morales to produce the cedula of the interested party for 1907, whereupon Morales said\u00a0 that Paulino Esperanza was only 18 years of age; thereupon the clerk changed the number 42 to read 18.<br\/><br\/>That the cedula having been signed in the above form by the municipal treasurer and delivered to the accused, the latter sent the same to Paulino Esperanza through Pastor Loberes.<br\/><br\/>The punishable fact consists in that the cedula of Paulino Esperanza now appears neither with the age of 18 years, nor with that of 42, but with that of 48 years.<br\/><br\/>The truth is, and it is so shown in the record, that Paulino Esperanza did not obtain a cedula for 1907; but together with the cedula for 1908 he received a document bearing date of the 17th of March, 1908, stating that Morales was in possession of P2 for the said cedula for 1907.<br\/><br\/>The cedula on which the two successive alterations have been made still perceptibly shows that 42 had first been written on it; that over the 4 a 1 was afterwards written, and that the 2 had been changed into an 8; and that later (the handwriting and ink being different) an angle had been added to the 1 in order to convert it into a 4, the cedula now appearing \"48 years of age\" instead of 42 as first written, and instead of 18 as it should have left the hands of the clerk.<br\/><br\/>The following are also findings in the judgment:\u00a0 \"That the accused knew Paulino Esperanza, and was perfectly well aware of the fact that said Paulino was much older than 18; that the personal appearance of Paulino Esperanza would convince anybody that he is a fairly old man; and that this cedula was altered after having been issued.\"<br\/><br\/>And in view of these last findings the court below found that Morales is the author of the falsification of said cedula; a finding completely impugned by the first assignment of error in the brief of the defense in this instance.<br\/><br\/>The first of the findings of fact in the judgment is proven by the original order issued by the accused (Exhibit D) page 57, and furthermore by the testimony of Lieutenant Candido Morgano or Marsan who received the order and sent up Paulino Esperanza, Pastor Loberes, and two others who had no cedulas for 1907.\u00a0 In addition, the accused admits that he issued said order (folio 43).<br\/><br\/>But the accused denied that he had ever had anything to do with Paulino Esperanza, or that the latter had been sent to him.<br\/><br\/>It has been proven that Paulino Esperanza, Pastor Loberes, Anastasio Lorio, and Albino Lodrono were sent to the house of Councilor Morales on the 15th of March, 1908, by his instructions; their appearrance having been ordered by Lieutenant Marsan and effected by corporal of police Cristino Lobendino according to the testimony of these witnesses in addition to that of Esperanza and Loberes.<br\/><br\/>The second finding is a proven fact, that Paulino Esperanza delivered P4 to Councilor Morales because the latter had offered to obtain the cedulas for 1907 and 1908.\u00a0 Paulino Esperanza so testified and it is shown by the cedula obtained, and the receipt (Exhibit B) which reads as follows:\u00a0 \"Received the sum of P2 for the purpose of delivering a cedula for 1907 to Paulino Esperanza when I go to Albay.\u00a0 Daraga, March 17,1908-N. Morales;\" the authenticity of this document, as signed by Morales, was established without contradiction by the provincial fiscal as a witness.<br\/><br\/>The accused says that on the 18th or 19th of\u00a0 March, 1908, he gave two receipts to a woman who begged him for two cedulas, one for her husband and another for one of her relatives.\u00a0 He denied any knowledge of the cedula obtained for Paulino Esperanza, stating that he did not recall said name, or remember having obtained from the treasury the cedula in question, but he did remember having given the receipt to a certain Esperanza.\u00a0 And one of his witnesses says that it was on the 14th or 15th when Morales gave those receipts.<br\/><br\/>This being the case, the receipt in question could not be one of those that the accused and his witness say was given to a woman, because it was on the 18th or 19th of March when Morales, as he says, saw the woman, or, the 14th or 15th as his witness says, while the receipt in Esperanza's hands bears date of the 17th\u00a0 of said month and year.<br\/><br\/>The third, fourth, and fifth findings are also proven facts, supported by the uncontradicted testimony of the municipal treasurer of Albay, Godofredo Aquende, and his clerk Norberto Avaluado, and fully confirmed by the stub of the cedula in question produced in evidence.\u00a0 There appears on said stub \"this cedula was issued on the 16th of March, 1908;\" and in the age space, first 42, crossed out in parenthesis, and then 18.<br\/><br\/>And finally, the last finding, proved by the testimony of Pastor Loberes for whom Morales offered to take out a cedula in Albay, and to whom besides his own, Morales delivered the one for Paulino\u00a0 Esperanza together with a receipt to be delivered to the latter; this Loberes delivered, the cedula in question being identified as the one so delivered.<br\/><br\/>Paulino Esperanza can not be the author of this falsification.\u00a0 It has been proven that he paid out P4, two for the cedula for 1908 which he holds, and two for that for 1907, which, according to a document; the accused promised to get him.\u00a0 If Esperanza had gone to the municipal treasury for cedulas for the years 1907 and\u00a0 1908, he would certainly have obtained them; in that case the P2 for 1908 would have been paid, as they were paid, into the municipal treasury, as would also the other P2 for the year 1907 and which, on the 16th of March, he gave for that purpose to Councilor Morales who unlawfully kept them in his possession.<br\/><br\/>Neither could the clerk, Avaluado, be the author of the falsification, because he made out the cedula for 1908 (bearing the age of 42 or 18, according to the declarations that he was receiving from the councilor) and collected P2 for the said cedula, but there is no proof that he received the other P2 for the 1907 cedula; this last amount is proved to have remained in the hands of the accused Morales.\u00a0 Had he not taken the two pesos or otherwise benefited himself he would not ordinarily have run the risk of being prosecuted for falsification, as did the accused in undertaking to obtain a 1907 cedula for Paulino Esperanza and then neither producing it nor the purchase money from the 17th of March until the 23d of October, 1908, when he was charged with having caused the insertion of the words 18 years of age instead of 42, in order to convince the treasurer that there was no necessity of obtaining a prior cedula, that is, one for 1907, and afterwards again changing the figures to 48 in order to make it fit the case.<br\/><br\/>According to the Penal Code two crimes would have been committed, falsification of an official document as a means to <i>estafa<\/i> as an end; the penalty for the graver crime should be imposed in the maximum degree.\u00a0 (Art. 89.) And the penalty to be applied should be that corresponding to the crime of falsification of a certificate of registration (<i>cedula de vecindad<\/i>), that is, <i>arresto mayor<\/i> in its maximum degree to <i>prision correccional<\/i> in its minimum degree, from four months and one day to two years and four months, and a fine up to 3,250 pesetas.<br\/><br\/>But the complaint was filed in accordance with section 55 of the Internal Revenue Law, and the penalty for defrauding the public revenue should be imposed in accordance therewith.<br\/><br\/>This court can not confirm the addition of one day to the penalty of one year's imprisonment imposed under the provisions of a law which allows ample discretion in imposing, from one extreme to the other, the penalty indicated.\u00a0 <i>One day<\/i> more, thus imposed, is utterly ridiculous, because it has no such far-reaching consequence as where, under the Penal Code, <i>one day<\/i> additional represents a higher degree in the penalty, according to\u00a0 the graduated scale that regulates the discretion of courts, and which signifies that the court desired to imposed the superior degree but to moderate the penalty imposed thereunder to its minimum.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, provided that the penalty of imprisonment shall be for one year only, the judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed as to\u00a0 the rest thereof, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson<\/i>, and <i>Moreland, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><\/div>",

O.<\/i> Luciano de los Reyes.\"\u00a0 After the check was marked in this manner it was passed to the cashier of the bank, who, in reliance upon the indorsement, paid or ordered the same to be paid.<br\/><br\/>During the period referred to the defendant Lim Buanco had an account with the bank, and drew large sums of money therefrom, by means of checks signed by him, and inspected and indorsed as above by Reyes.\u00a0 During this time a conspiracy existed between the defendants Lim Buanco and Reyes for the withdrawal of funds from the bank by Lim Buanco, regardless of whether he had any funds in the bank to his credit, and in furtherance of this conspiracy, the entries in the accounts of Lim Buanco on the books of the bank were fraudulently and illegally manipulated by Reyes in such a manner as to make the books show an apparent credit balance, when in fact Lim Buanco was owing to the bank a large sum of money.<br\/><br\/>On the 6th day of October, 1906, Lim Buanco drew a check on the Banco Espa\u00f1ol-Filipino for the sum of 1,000 pesos, and this check was through the agency of another bank in which it was deposited by Lim Buanco, presented in due course of business to and paid by the Banco Espa\u00f1ol-Filipino.\u00a0 Before the check was thus paid, Reyes, acting in his capacity as an employee of the bank, indorsed thereon the words <i>\"Corriente<\/i>. P. O.\u00a0 Luciano de los Reyes,\" although at the time this indorsement was made, Lim Buanco had no actual credit balance in the bank, and no permission had been given him by any officer or officers in authority of said bank to overdraw his account.\u00a0 In this manner the defendants Lim Buanco and Reyes, in furtherance of the conspiracy to cheat, deceive, and defraud the bank, secured the payment of said check, although they both knew at the time that the defendant Lim Buanco had no credit balance in said bank, but was in fact indebted to the bank in the sum of more than 300,000 pesos, which had previously been withdrawn from the bank by means of similar checks drawn by Lim Buanco, and fraudulently indorsed as correct by Reyes.\u00a0 The amount of money thus fraudulently obtained from the bank by means of the check as aforesaid, with interest thereon at the rate of 6 per cent per annum from the date of the check to the date of the decision in the court below, to wit, January 16, 1909, amounted to the sum of P1,136.50, Philippine currency, equivalent to 5,682.50 pesetas, which the court determined to be the damage occasioned to and suffered by the bank by reason of the aforesaid fraudulent conduct of the defendants acting together in furtherance of said conspiracy.\u00a0 No part of the said sum has been returned or paid back to the Banco Espa\u00f1ol-Filipino by Lim Buanco, or by Reyes, or by any person acting for or in his or their behalf.\u00a0 The trial court also found that Lim Buanco and Reyes each had voluntarily admitted the crime as charged against him.<br\/><br\/>Separate trials were granted to the defendants, but the court, after both were convicted, embodied its finding of facts and conclusions in one decision, and one joint sentence was pronounced upon the defendants.\u00a0 Thereafter each defendant separately moved for a new trial, which was denied, and an appeal was taken to this\u00a0 court, where, as in the court below, they appear by separate attorneys.\u00a0 Although separate briefs are filed, the various assignments of errors raise essentially the same questions.<br\/><br\/>The questions here presented as to the sufficiency of the complaint, the nature of the crime, the right to separate trials, and the fact of the reference by the trial court to the fact that neither defendant testified in his own behalf, were raised in the case of The United States <i>vs.<\/i> Lino Eguia Lim Buanco (<i>alias<\/i> Lim Buanco) and Luciano de los Reyes, No. 5240, and determined against the defendants.\u00a0 What was said with reference thereto in the opinion in that case need not be here repeated.\u00a0 The rulings made are adhered to and followed.\u00a0 It remains to be determined whether the defendants have been once before in jeopardy for the same offense charged against them by the information in this case.<br\/><br\/>The defendants each interpose the plea of former jeopardy, and contend that the acts charged in this information were done in furtherance of the conspiracy which was alleged in the information in case No. 5240, entitled \"The United States <i>vs.<\/i> Lino Eguia Lim Buanco (<i>alias<\/i> Lim Buanco) and Luciano de los Reyes,\" which was tried on the day previous to that on which the present case was tried.\u00a0 This contention rests upon the assumption that the crime for which the defendants were in the first case convicted consisted of obtaining the entire sum of more than 300,000 pesos from the Banco Espa\u00f1ol-Filipino by means of a fraudulent conspiracy between the defendants, and that their acts done in furtherance of said conspiracy constituted a single continuing offense.\u00a0 In the former case the defendants were charged with having defrauded the bank by means of a certain check for 2,000 pesos.\u00a0 In the present case they are charged with having\u00a0 defrauded the bank by means of a certain other check for 1,000 pesos, and in another case which was submitted herewith, they are charged with having defrauded the same bank by means of another check for the sum of 3,500 pesos.\u00a0 The first two checks bore date of October 6, 1906, and the other, April 2, 1906.\u00a0 In the information in each case it is alleged in substance that the defendants and each of them conspired to defraud the bank; that the defendant Lim Buanco falsely represented that there were funds in the bank to pay the check in question; that the check was fraudulently marked <i>\"Corriente<\/i>, P. O. Luciano de los Reyes,\" by Reyes, who knew at the time that Lim Buanco had no money to his credit to pay the check, and that the fraud was effected in furtherance of a conspiracy between the two parties.\u00a0 But in each case the defendants and each of them are charged with having defrauded the bank of a specific sum of money by means of a specifically mentioned and identified check, and the particular check described in the information and introduced in evidence in each case is for a different amount from that referred to in the information and introduced in evidence in the other cases.\u00a0 The check referred to in one information could not therefore have been properly offered in evidence to prove the allegation in either of the other cases.\u00a0 These informations do not charge the defendants with the technical crime of conspiracy.\u00a0 The substance of the allegation in each case is that the money was obtained from the bank by means of the fraudulent cooperation of Lim Buanco and Reyes under circumstances which constitute the deceit necessary to constitute the crime of <i>estafa<\/i>, and of that crime only the defendants were convicted.\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Lino Eguia Lim Buanco (<i>alias<\/i> Lim Buanco) and Luciano de los Reyes, No. 5240.)\u00a0 It is true that by the same methods, and by means of other checks drawn, certified, and their payment secured in the same fraudulent manner, a large sum of money in the aggregate was withdrawn from the bank, but nevertheless each act constituted a separate crime.\u00a0 The preparation, approval, and payment of numerous checks under such circumstances can not be considered as one continuing offense.\u00a0 Each separate fraudulent obtaining of money from the bank by means of such methods constituted a distinct crime, and a conviction of one of such crimes can not be pleaded in bar to a prosecution for another.<br\/><br\/>It may be noted, however, that even if it were true that the defendants had been charged and convicted of conspiracy, the plea of former jeopardy would not be good as against a prosecution for one of several crimes, each distinct from the other, committed in furtherance of the conspiracy.\u00a0 In a monographic note in the case of People <i>vs.<\/i> McDaniels (92 American State Reports, 81), it is said that [p. 134]:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"Where several acts are done in pursuance of a conspiracy, each act being\u00a0 distinct from the other, the fact that they are in fact done in pursuance of a conspiracy does not make one act the 'same offense' as the other.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>This statement is sustained by the case of Wallace <i>vs.<\/i> State (41 Fla., 547, 26 South., 713), where it was held that\u2014<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"While the conspiracy may\u00a0 be single, and therefore subject to one indictment only, yet the felonies accomplished by means of the conspiracy were separate and distinct, depending upon different acts, provable by different evidence, and accomplished by distinct though similar means.\u00a0 The evidence essentially necessary to sustain one indictment would not sustain either of the others, nor could defendant be convicted upon one information upon the evidence necessary to sustain either of the others.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>We find no material errors in this record.\u00a0 The defendants were properly convicted and sentenced, and the judgment is therefore affirmed.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

that Gonzaga as treasurer paid the amounts to Jarabas instead of to Enabe, and included them in his accounts-current with the Government as having been paid to Enabe, when as a matter of fact Enabe never had any such contract, never signed any of the papers, and never received any of the money which was so paid to Jarabas.<br\/><br\/>Gonzaga demanded a separate trial.\u00a0 Ramos and Jarabas were tried together, and the latter was convicted.\u00a0 Ramos was absolved because the evidence failed to show his connection with the transaction.\u00a0 It will be observed that it is charged that Ramos simulated the contract and approved the accounts; that Jarabas presented the same with the false signatures thereon to Gonzaga, who paid them to him instead of to Enabe, by whom the receipt attached to the voucher purported to be signed, and included the amounts in his accounts-current with the Government as having been paid to Enabe.\u00a0 Gonzaga's part in the transaction as charged consisted then in paying the account presented by Jarabas upon false documents, and afterwards including the same in his accounts-current with the Government.\u00a0 The criminality of his act depended upon his knowledge of the facts that no such contract existed, that Enabe's signature was forged, and that Jarabas was not entitled to receive the money on behalf of Enabe.\u00a0 The court found Gonzaga guilty of the crime of falsification of public documents under article 300 of the Penal Code, and sentenced him to suffer the penalty of reclusion temporal, and to be confined in the Insular Penitentiary of the Philippine Islands for a period of fourteen years eight months and one day, and to pay a fine of 1,250 pesetas, and further to suffer the penalties of article 56 of the Penal Code, and to pay the costs of this action.<br\/><br\/>It is evident that this transaction was irregular, and that Jarabas presented false documents to the president of the board of health and to the treasurer, Gonzaga.\u00a0 No contract in fact existed between the municipality and Enabe, and the latter's name was affixed to the accounts and the receipts without his knowledge or consent.\u00a0 But rice was in fact being furnished by the municipality to quarantined persons, and it appears that Jarabas was the person who was attending to its distribution.\u00a0 The accounts and the vouchers were regular in form, and purported to state valid claims and obligations.\u00a0 Knowledge of their falsity was essential to criminality on the part of Gonzaga, and that knowledge has not been shown.\u00a0 The burden was on the Government to show that Gonzaga was a party to the scheme by which these parties were defrauding the municipality through the preparation and use of false documents, or with knowledge of the fact that the documents were false, he used them for purposes of gain to himself.\u00a0 There is no evidence whatever to connect Gonzaga with the preparation of the documents, and his statement in his accounts current that the money had been paid to Enabe would have been proved in legal effect had the documents been genuine, even though the money, had been actually delivered to Jarabas for Enabe.\u00a0 Payment to an authorized agent is payment to his principal.<br\/><br\/>The district auditor testified that it was the duty of the treasurer to pay only to the person whose name appeared on the voucher as entitled to receive it, and to see that the receipt was signed in his presence.\u00a0 Our attention has not been called to any such provision of law, but assuming such to be the legal duty of the treasurer, the failure to observe it would not justify his conviction of the crime charged in this information.\u00a0 We can not find the evidence in this record to sustain the conclusion of the trial court that Gonzaga could not help but have known that Enabe had no contract with the municipality, and that he aided in preparing and subsequently used these false documents with the intention to defraud the Government.\u00a0 The judgment is therefore reversed and the defendant absolved, with the costs of both instances <i>de oficio<\/i>.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

A man, who turned out to be Guillermo Ribis, made his appearance and approaching the <i>palay<\/i>, attempted to carry it away with him, but at that instant Bumanglag, Bundoc, and Ribao assaulted the presumed thief with sticks and cutting and stabbing weapons; as a result of the struggle which ensued the person attacked fell down and died instantly, Bumanglag and his companions believing that Guillermo Ribis was the author of several robberies and thefts that had occurred in the place.<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing, the provincial fiscal filed a complaint on January 15,1909, charging Rafael Bumanglag, Gregorio Bundoc, and Antonio Ribao with the crime of homicide, and the trial judge, on February 5 of the present year, rendered judgment in the case, sentencing the three accused persons to the penalty of fourteen years eight months and one day of <i>reclusion temporal<\/i>, with the accessories, and to the payment of an indemnity of P1,000 to the heirs of the deceased, and the costs in equal parts, from which decision only Gregorio Bundoc appealed.<br\/><br\/>From the facts above mentioned, fully  proven in this case, the commission of the crime of homicide, defined and punished by article 404 of the Penal Code, is inferred, inasmuch as Guillermo Ribis was violently deprived of his life in consequence of serious wounds and bruises, some of them of a mortal nature, as appears from a certificate issued by a physician who examined the body of the deceased, and who ratified said certificate at the trial under oath.<br\/><br\/>The accused Bundoc, the only appellant, pleaded not guilty, but, in the absence of justification, and his exculpatory allegation being unreasonable, it is not proper to hold that he assaulted and killed the deceased, with the help of his codefendants, in order to defend himself from an attack made by the former with a bolo.<br\/><br\/>Both Gregorio Bundoc and his codefendants Bumanglag and Ribao declared that, during the fight with the deceased Ribis, they only beat the latter with sticks, because he unsheathed the bolo he carried; but from the examination made of the body it appeared that several serious wounds had been inflicted with cutting and stabbing weapons, besides some bruises, and according to the declaration of the health officer Felipe Barba, which declaration was confirmed by the municipal president of Laoag, the bolo worn by the deceased was in its sheath and hanging from his  waist; therefore it can not be concluded that the deceased even intended to assault his murderers with his bolo either before he was attacked by them or during the fight, because, had Ribis made use of the bolo he carried sheathed, the bolo would have been found unsheathed at the place where the fight occurred, and it is not reasonable to believe that, before falling to the ground in a dying condition he succeeded in sheathing his bolo, in which condition it was found on his body.<br\/><br\/>It is therefore indisputable that, without any prior illegal aggression and the other requisites which would fully or partially exempt the accused from criminal responsibility, the appellant and his two companions assaulted Guillermo Ribis with sticks and cutting and stabbing arms, inflicting upon him serious and mortal wounds, and therefore, the said accused is guilty of the crime of homicide as co-principal by direct participation, fully convicted, together with his codefendants who are already serving their sentence.<br\/><br\/>In the commission of the crime we should take into account the mitigating' circumstance No. 7 of article 9 of the Penal Code, because the  defendant acted with loss of reason and self-control on seeing that Guillermo Ribis was taking material possession of the <i>palay<\/i> seized and hidden by him on the previous night, thus committing one of the numerous unlawful acts perpetrated at that place, to the damage and prejudice of those who, by their labor endeavor to provide themselves with the necessary elements for their subsistence and that of their families.  The special circumstance established by article 11 of the same code should be also considered in favor of  the accused, in view of the erroneous and quite general belief that it is legal to punish, even to excess the thief who, in defiance of law and justice, while refusing to work, devotes himself to depriving his neighbors of the fruits of their arduous labors; these two circumstances are considered in the  present case as especially admissible, without any aggravating circumstance, and they determine, according to article 81, rule 5, of the Penal Code, the imposition of the penalty immediately inferior to that prescribed by the law, and in its minimum degree, and therefore-<br\/><br\/>By virtue of the foregoing considerations, we are of the opinion that, the judgment appealed from being reversed with respect to Gregorio Bundoc only, the latter should be, and is hereby, sentenced to the penalty of six years and one day of <i>prision mayor<\/i>, to the accessories of article 01 of the code, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased jointly or severally with his codefendants, in  the sum of P1,000, and to pay one-third the costs of both instances.

The following morning he discovered a portion of the missing <i>palay<\/i> in a field of sugar cane about 100 meters from the granary from which it was taken.  For the purpose of discovering who was the author of the crime arid of bringing him to justice, he secured the assistance of Gregorio Bundoc, Antonio Rivao, and Saturnino Tumamao, the first being his cousin and the others his neighbors and friends, to watch with him the succeeding night in the vicinity of the <i>palay<\/i>, acting upon the expectation that the robber would return to secure it.  Some time after dark of the night succeeding the robbery, Bumanglag, and the other persons mentioned, gathered together in said field of sugar cane, near to the <i>palay<\/i> in question, placing themselves so as to surround it in a measure, and awaited the appearance of the malefactor.  At about 10 o'clock there came into the field the deceased, Guillermo Rivis, who approached the <i>palay<\/i>, picked it up, and started to carry it away.  At this moment Bumanglag presented himself in front of Rivis, stopping his further progress, whereupon Rivis attacked him viciously with a bolo and they engaged in a hand-to-hand struggle.  Bumanglag, upon finding that he was likely to be killed by the robber because of his great strength and the fact that he was armed with a bolo, called for assistance, whereupon his three companions rushed forward and, seeing the  extremity in which Bumanglag was, joined in the struggle for the purpose of his protection.  Within a few minutes Rivis fell to the earth mortally injured and soon expired.<br\/><br\/>The only proofs in the trial relating to the death are the statements and testimony of the  defendants themselves.  Immediately after the death of Rivis, they, acting voluntarily, went to the nearest justice of the peace and stated what had occurred.  Each one signed a statement of the facts constituting the occurrence as he understood them.  Later each one of defendants testified on the trial.<br\/><br\/>Bundoc, in the written statement made by him before the justice of the peace, said that at about 10 o'clock of the night in question he saw Rivis enter the field, going toward the place where the <i>palay<\/i> was located, and a little while afterwards Bumanglag called him and his companions to come to his assistance because a man was attacking him, and that thereupon he, Bundoc, and his companions, \"went to the assistance of Bumanglag, who was fighting with Rivis, and, in view of the fact that it appeared that Bumanglag was not able to resist his adversary  because he had a bolo and Bumanglag had only a bamboo stick,\" he and his companions took part in the fight solely to protect his cousin and that, during the struggle that followed, the decedent was killed.  He said further that he recognized the deceased, Rivis, as a resident of San Nicolas, and that he was a person of bad character and was known as the author of various robberies and burglaries which had occurred in that vicinity.<br\/><br\/>The statements of the other defendants are substantially the same as that of Bundoc.<br\/><br\/>Upon the trial Bumanglag testified, relative to the acts of defendants from which the death of Rivis resulted, that Rivis came into the field, arranged the <i>palay<\/i> in handy form, picked it up, and started to go away with it; that thereupon Bumanglag told him to halt; that Rivis instantly dropped his bundle to the ground and immediately attacked Bumanglag with a bolo, striking at him several times but failing to hit him on account of stalks of sugar cane which Bumanglag interposed between himself and his assailant; that, while Rivis was trying to kill him with his bolo, he called to his companions for help, at the same time trying to defend himself with blows of his bamboo stick; that his companions soon arrival, and, between the three, they struck him several blows, from which he died immediately; that they carried  no weapons except bamboo sticks, while the deceased was armed with a large bolo.<br\/><br\/>The statement of Bumanglag made upon the trial is somewhat different from his statement made before the justice of the peace but is more in accord with the statements of the other defendants in the case, both before the justice of the peace and upon the trial of the case.  Bundoc testified that Bumanglag called for help because he was being attacked by the robber, who was armed with a bolo, and that he was likely to be killed at any instant, and that he and his companions, desiring to defend Bumanglag from his imminent peril, ran forward to his assistance, and that during the fight which occurred, the deceased was killed.<br\/><br\/>These are the only proofs before us relative to the manner in which Rivis met his death.  The court below, however, refused to believe the story of defendants because of certain alleged contradictory circumstances which appear in the proofs.  These circumstances, as presented by the court below and here argued by the fiscal, are that (1) while the defendants claim,in their statements and testimony that the deceased attacked Bumanglag with his bolo, nevertheless, when the body of the decedent was the next day taken possession of by the justice of the peace, the bolo was still in its sheath; and (2) that while the defendants stated and testified that they were not armed with any kind of weapons except bamboo sticks or clubs, still the testimony of Barba, the sanitary inspector of that district, shows that some of the wounds upon the body of the deceased were made with sharp instruments.  Upon these two circumstances, impugning, as it is alleged they do, the evidence of the defendants in1 their own behalf, the court below found the defendants guilty of homicide.<br\/><br\/>The only evidence in relation to these two circumstances is that of the justice of the peace and the sanitary inspector, who assert that when they went to examine the body and take charge of it, the next day after the death, they found the bolo in its sheath.  It appears, however, that no one watched the body during the interval running between the time when the death occurred and when the body was first examined, and therefore no one knows how it was handled or what was done with or to it.  As to the, other point, namely, that the wounds were made with sharp instruments, it may be said that the witness Barba, the sanitary inspector, who is the only one who testified in relation to that matter, stated that the only two wounds that were mortal were located, one in the right side of the head, caused by a sharp instrument, the other a contusion at the base of the neck upon the left side, not made with a sharp instrument.  He does not say which one of the wounds caused the death of the decedent, neither does he state the facts upon which he bases his claim that the wounds were made with sharp instruments.  He simply states his conclusions, without presenting the facts from which such conclusions naturally spring.  It is well known, however, that a wound, smooth edged and clean cut, and simulating with remarkable closeness a wound made with a sharp cutting instrument, may be and frequently is produced by a wooden  instrument or club, particularly where, as in this case, said instrument or club is extremely hard and has a sharp edge.  The witness Barba was not a physician or surgeon and had had little experience with wounds.  His judgment was scarcely better than that of the average man.  In no sense was he qualified as an expert.  Besides, and this is very important, the only wounds found upon the person of deceased <i>were about the head, neck, and face<\/i>.  No wound was found on any other part of the person.  Does this look like the use of knives or bolos by the defendants ?  If they had been using such weapons it is almost certain that the fatal wound would have been found in the body and not the head; or, if in the head, the wound made would have been far more extensive and ghastly than any  of those found.<br\/><br\/>It appears from the  undisputed testimony (if we except the two circumstances above referred to) that the decedent was a man of bad reputation; that he was a thief, a robber, and a convicted criminal, having served at least one term in prison for robbery; that he was known in all that country as a leader of criminal bands and as an all-round desperado; that he was a man of exceptionally large stature and of unusual strength; that at the time of his attack upon Rafael Bumanglag he was armed with a bolo; that on the evening before his death he had robbed the granary of Bumanglag, taking a part of the property which he had stolen away with him at the time and leaving the other portion, which he was unable to carry, in a place where it would be easily accessible when he desired later to remove it; that on the night of the event he had returned to carry away the balance of the property which he had stolen the night before; that while' in the act of taking it he was surprised and confronted by the owner thereof; that he immediately assailed said owner viciously with his bolo, and so pressed him that, for the protection of his life, he called upon his friends for assistance; that his companions, on arriving, saw that he was likely to be killed at any instant and they, endeavoring to save his life, attacked the decedent.<br\/><br\/>It is not known who among the defendants killed the decedent or what  blow caused his death.  All that is known is that in the struggle which occurred, resulting from the efforts of three of the defendants to save the life of the fourth, the decedent met his death.<br\/><br\/>It nowhere appears, except from the fact of death itself, that the defendants sought or intended to kill the decedent.  Their sole purpose appears from the evidence to have been to protect their companion from the murderous assault of decedent.  Such purpose could have been accomplished as well by disabling as by killing him; and it must not be forgotten in this connection that the effect produced by the use of their bamboo sticks was not that which is ordinarily produced.  This consideration was regarded by this court as having much importance in the case of the United States <i>vs.<\/i> Sosa (4 Phil. Rep., 104).  This court has, moreover, held that a piece of bamboo (<i>una simple ca\u00f1a partida<\/i>), exactly what was used by defendants in the case at bar, was a weapon insufficient ordinarily to put the life of a person  attacked in imminent peril.  (U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> De Castro, 2 Phil. Rep., 67; U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Mack, 8 Phil. Rep., 701).<br\/><br\/>I am convinced that there is a strong doubt of the criminal responsibility of the  defendants, particularly of the appellant.  Article 8 of the Penal Code reads in part as follows:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"The following are not delinquent and are, therefore, exempt from criminal liability:<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">*         *          *       *         *          *         *<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"5.  He who acts in defense of the person or rights of his spouse, ascendants, descendants, or legitimate, natural, or adopted brothers or sisters, or of his relatives by affinity in the same degrees and those by consanguinity within the fourth civil degree,  provided the first and second circumstances mentioned in the foregoing number are attendant, and provided that in case the party attacked first gave provocation, the defender took no part therein.<br\/><br\/>\"6.  He who acts in defense of the person or rights of a stranger, provided  the first and second circumstances mentioned in No. 4 are attendant and that the defender is not actuated by revenge,  resentment, or other illegal motive.\"<br\/><br\/>Subdivision 4 is as follows:<br\/><br\/>\"4.  He who acts in defense of his person or rights, provided there are the following attendant circumstances:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"(1) Illegal aggression.<br\/>\"(2) Reasonable  necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel it.<br\/>\"(3) Lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending himself.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><\/blockquote><br\/>That there was an unlawful aggression seems to me to be  indisputable under the evidence.  The great preponderance of the testimony, in fact the undisputed evidence, is to that effect.  Every witness who touched the subject testified positively that the assault upon Bumanglag was made with a bolo.  It is admitted that the decedent had one at the time of the assault.  Nevertheless the fiscal contends that the assault was not made with a bolo and bases that contention upon the single fact, before adverted to, that, many hours after the assault, the bolo was found in its sheath on the dead man's body.  The probative effect of that fact is founded purely in an inference which necessarily presupposes that the bolo had not been replaced in its sheath by anyone after the death of  Rivis, his body having been left unwatched, as before stated, for a  considerable period of time.  It seems to me, however, that inference is met and sufficiently overcome by the manifest and perfect unreasonableness of the assumption, which must necessarily arise from that inference, that a man of the character of the decedent, having been caught red-handed in the commission of a robbery by the owner of the property against which the felony had been and was being committed, and that owner armed with a club, would attack  such owner with his naked hands when he carried at his side a formidable weapon with which to defend himself in precisely such an emergency.  It is wholly unreasonable, if not positively unbelievable, that the decedent, under all the circumstances of this case, did not draw his bolo.  That he did unsheath it and did attack Bumanglag therewith is the sworn  statement of every witness who testified on that subject.  This proof, taken in connection with the unreasonableness of the claim that the decedent, caught red-handed in felony, attacked with his bare hands a man armed with a club, the man against whose property he was in the very act of perpetrating a felony, and permitted himself to be beaten to death, when he carried at his side a formidable and effective weapon of aggression as well as defense, can not be overcome by a mere inference deduced from the circumstance that the bolo, many hours after the event, was found in its sheath.  The entire evidence, fairly considered, reasonably establishes, it seems to me, not only an unlawful but a dangerous aggression.  (Supreme court of Spain, 17 November, 1897; 6 July, 1898; 16 March, 1892; 11 December, 1896; 26 January, 1897; 11 December, 1896; 6 April, 1904; 27 June, 1894; 30 January, 1904; 16 February, 1905; 10 July, 1902; 27 June, 1903; 28 February, 1906; 17 March, 888; 29 May, 1888; 13 February, 1890; 20 January, 1894; 24 October, 1895; 27 January, 1896; 11 December, 1896; 26 January, 1897; 30 September, 1897; 10 February, 1898; 6 July, 1898; 21 December, 1898; 24 January, 1899; 29 September, 1900; 12 January, 1901; 21 April, 1902; 20 December, 1902; 4 February, 1903; 11 July, 1903; 11 July, 1904; 22 March, 1905; 8 July, 1905.)<br\/><br\/>In the case of Stoneham <i>vs.<\/i> Commonwealth (86 Va., 523, 525, 526), where the defendant was being followed up by the deceased who was wholly unarmed and without any demonstration of violence except raising his fist, and the defendant shot and killed him, the court said:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"The accused was closely pressed by an attacking man, who was his superior in strength, and his situation was one which justified his fear of grievous bodily harm; and, if the jury had found the facts as certified by the court, they should have found the homicide to be excusable self-defense under all the circumstances of this case.\"  (Parrishe's case, 81 Va., 1.)<\/blockquote><br\/>Moreover, it is admitted that the defendant, Bumanglag, was upon his own land and was, therefore, defending his habitation against a violent and wrongful invasion when the assault upon him was made in the manner proved.<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"A person may repel force by force in defense of his habitation or property, as well as in defense of his person, violence or surprise to commit a known felony upon either, and, if need be, may kill his adversary.\"  (25 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of L., 275.)<\/blockquote><br\/>In the case of United States <i>vs.<\/i> Brello (9 Phil. Rep., 424), the court said (p. 425) :<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"The evidence of the defendant and his witnesses was to the effect that at 10 o'clock at night Candelario came to the house of the defendant, knocked at the door, and insisted upon the defendant coming out, saying that if he did not he would burn the house.  The defendant refused to go out and thereupon Candelario broke the door down, came in and attacked the defendant with a cane, throwing him to the ground two or three times.  He defended himself as well as he could and finally seized a bolo and struck Candelario in the stomach.  Immediately after the affair the defendant presented himself to the authorities of the town, stating what had happened.  <i>It does not appear that Candelario had any other weapon than a cane.<\/i><br\/><br\/>\"These facts to our mind constitute a complete defense.  Candelario committed a crime in entering the house as he did, the defendant was justified in protecting himself with such weapons as were at his hand, and if from that defense the death of the aggressor resulted, that result must be attributed to his own wrongful act and can not be charged to the defendant.\"<br\/><br\/>(The italics do not appear in the original.)<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>If the defendant in the above case was in danger of death or of great bodily harm, and that danger was imminent, and if the means  employed by him to repel the assault were reasonably necessary to attain that result, then, how much more perfectly were these conditions present in the case at bar!  If the defendant in the case cited was entitled legally to be relieved from all criminal liability, upon what subtile distinction, and, above all, upon what principles of justice, shall we found a judgment declaring guilty  the appellant at bar?<br\/><br\/>While the premises upon which the assault occurred were not, strictly speaking, the habitation of the defendant, Bumanglag, still as matter of law no substantial distinction is made between habitation and premises. The Supreme Court of the United States has held directly (Beard <i>vs.<\/i> United States, 158 U. S., 550) that for the purposes of self-defense there is no difference between one's habitation and his premises.  In that case the court said, in part, Mr. Justice Harlan writing (p. 559):<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"But the court below committed an error of a more serious character when it told the jury, as in effect it did by different forms of expression, that if the accused could have saved his own life and avoided taking the life of Will Jones by retreating from and getting out of the way of the latter  as he advanced upon him, the law made it his duty to do so; and if he did not, when it was in his power to do so without putting his own life or body in imminent peril, he was guilty of manslaughter.  The court seemed to think if the deceased had advanced upon the accused while the latter was in his dwelling house and under such circumstances as indicated the intention of the former to take life or inflict great bodily injury, and if, without retreating, the accused had taken the life of his assailant, having at the time reasonable grounds to believe,  and in good faith believing, that his own life would be taken or great bodily harm done him unless he killed the accused, the case would have been one of justifiable homicide.  To that proposition we give our entire assent.  But we can not agree that the accused was under any greater obligation, when on his own premises, near his dwelling house, to retreat or run away from his assailant, than he would have been if attacked within his dwelling house.  The accused being where he had a right to be, on his own premises, constituting a part of his residence and home, at the time the deceased approached him in a threatening manner, and not having by language or by conduct provoked the deceased to assault him, the question for the jury was whether, without fleeing from his adversary, he had, at the moment he struck the deceased, reasonable grounds to believe, and in good faith believed, that he could not save his life or protect himself from great bodily harm except by doing what he did, namely, strike the deceased with his gun, and thus prevent his further advance upon him.  Even if the jury had been prepared to answer this question in the affirmative-and if it had been so answered the defendant should have been acquitted-they were instructed that the accused could not properly be acquitted on the ground of self-defense if they believed that, by retreating from his adversary, by 'getting out of the way,' he could have avoided taking life.  We can not give our assent to this doctrine.\"  (Erwin <i>vs.<\/i> State, 29 Ohio St., 186, 193, 199; Runyan <i>vs.<\/i> State, 57 Ind., 80, 84; Bishop's New Criminal Law, vol. 1, par. 850; 2 Wharton's Criminal Law, par. 1019, 7th ed.; Gallagher <i>vs.<\/i> State, 3 Minn., 270; Pond <i>vs.<\/i> People, 8  Mich., 150, 177; State <i>vs.<\/i> Dixon, 75 N.

Rep., 975; Tingle <i>vs.<\/i> Commonwealth, 11 S. W., 812; 3 Rice's Ev., par. 360.)<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>In the case of State <i>vs.<\/i> Cushing (14 Wash., 530), the court lays down the proposition  that a defendant while on his own premises outside of his dwelling house, was where he had a right to be, and if the deceased advanced upon him in a threatening manner and the defendant at the time had reasonable grounds to believe, and in good faith did believe, that the deceased intended to take  his life or do him great bodily harm, the defendant was not obliged  to retreat nor to consider whether he could safely retreat, but was entitled to stand his ground and meet any attack made upon him in such a way and with such force as, under all the circumstances, he at the moment honestly believed and had reasonable grounds to believe was necessary to save his own life or protect himself from great bodily harm.<br\/><br\/>It is also admitted that the defendant, Bumanglag, was defending his property from one who by surprise and violence was endeavoring to commit a felony against it.  Under such circumstances, if necessary to prevent the felony, he could lawfully kill the person attempting it.  (See 25 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of  Law, 275, above quoted; U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Wiltberger, 28 Fed. Cas., 727, 729; Commonwealth <i>vs.<\/i> Pipes, 158 Pa. St., 25, 30; Stoneham <i>vs.<\/i> Commonwealth, 86 Va., 523, 525; Ayers <i>vs.<\/i> State, 60 Miss., 709, 714; Crawford <i>vs.<\/i> State, 35 Am. St. Rep., 242, 244; People <i>vs.<\/i> Stone, 82 CaL, 36, 37, 38.)<br\/><br\/>It must not be forgotten that the undisputed evidence in the case at bar shows that Bumanglag, when attacked by deceased, although on his own premises and defending his own property, did all he could to avoid an encounter, retreating as far as safety permitted, and interposing between himself and his assailant stalks of sugar cane to impede the blows aimed at him, at the same time warding off the bolo thrusts with his bamboo stick.<br\/><br\/>It appears, therefore, that there was not only an unlawful aggression against the  defendant, Bumanglag, personally, but also that there was a wrongful invasion of his habitation and an attempt to commit a felony against his property.<br\/><br\/>It fairly appearing that there was an unlawful aggression, it is evident that the danger to Bumanglag was imminent and certain.  It is difficult to conceive how, with a weapon in the hands of decedent no more deadly than a bolo, the defendant could have bee,n  in danger more imminent and certain.  A notorious desperado (Hood <i>vs.<\/i> State, 27 So. Rep., 643) had been caught red-handed in a felony.  He was large, powerful (Stoneham <i>vs.<\/i> Commonwealth, 86 Va., 523, 525), and vicious.  It was dark.  So far as he knew, he was alone with his discoverer.  He carried a fighting bolo.  His discoverer had only a bamboo stick.  A long term in State prison stared him in the  face.  There was one way to avoid it and only one-to kill his discoverer.  If Bumanglag escaped, his arrest and conviction would surely follow.  Can any one doubt, under these circumstances, what such a man would do?  Bumanglag, as he confronted and recognized the man with whom he had to deal, realized instantly the imminence and certainty of his danger; and, as the robber dropped the stolen property and made the assault, Bumanglag knew that, without assistance from some source, his death would result.  His danger was fully appreciated and realized by his companions when they heard his cries for help.  They knew Rivis, his criminal record, his desperate character, his unusual strength.  (People <i>vs.<\/i> Webster, 139 N. Y., 73; State <i>vs.<\/i> Martin, 9 Ohio Dec, 778; State <i>vs.<\/i> Broussard, 39 La. Ann., 671; State <i>vs.<\/i> Bowles, 146 Mo., 6; State <i>vs.<\/i> Knapp, 45 N. H., 148.)  They knew he was armed and their companion was not.  They knew it lay with them whether Bumanglag was killed or not.  From their viewpoint was not their participation in the struggle fully justified?<br\/><br\/>It has been suggested that the means used by the defendants were not reasonably necessary for the protection of their companion, and that, being so many against one, they should not have struck the decedent with their clubs, but, rather, should have seized him with their hands, disarmed him and made him prisoner.  Among all the reasons assigned by the prosecution to sustain the conviction in this case this, to my mind, is the only one that in anywise appeals to reason or judgment.  In fact it is the only ground presented by the Government upon which such conviction can be sustained, if it can be sustained at all.  Still, giving that contention all of the weight which it justly carries, I yet am entirely lacking in confidence that it is sound under the circumstances of this case and the established law applicable thereto, and is, I believe, fully and fairly met by the substance of the following observations:<br\/><br\/>I remember, on occasion, seeing, in the public square in my native town, a large and powerful American attacked by a diminutive Italian armed with a stiletto.  I remember seeing the American running backward, leaping and dodging frantically to avoid the vicious thrusts aimed by the pursuing Italian at a vital part.  I remember also that at least a half dozen other Americans were at the rear of the Italian, closely following him and yelling to him at the top of their voices to desist, but not one daring to grapple with him to save the person attacked; and it was only when another American, having rushed into the yard of the hotel and secured a stick of wood, returned to the scene and gave the Italian from behind a heavy blow over the head with the club, stretching him senseless, that the assault was terminated.<br\/><br\/>The question naturally arises, Why did not some one seize the Italian?  The answer is, for the simple reason that a furious and vicious man armed with a dagger and skilled in its use is an individual dangerous to the very extreme, and the man who seizes him with his naked hands runs the chances of his life.  This is known to all.  But, comes the reply, Why not all seize him at once and thus avoid the danger to one?  The suggestion is simple but the execution is most difficult-in most cases little short of impossible.  On such an occasion the time within which action must be secured is of the very shortest.  Everything is excitement and confusion.  Everybody yells and dreads, but nobody thinks.  If there happens to be one who does think, he has no companions in the process.  There is, and in the vast majority of cases there can be, no concert of action.  The aid rendered in such cases is almost invariably individual.<br\/><br\/>In the case at bar, as in the illustration, there was a fierce struggle between two men.  The one was defending his own property on  his own premises and performing a service to society by doing his part to render amenable to the law a desperate and reckless criminal.  The other was an invader, a despoiler, wholly unrestrained by conscience or deterred by law-an inveterate enemy of society and his kind.  He was armed with a dangerous weapon.  He was desperate, vicious, criminal, and powerful, surprised in an act of felony.  It was dark.  He was attempting to take the life of his opponent.  It was unknown, and unknowable, when, in that struggle, the fatal blow would be delivered.  It might come at any instant.  Ought it fairly to be required as a matter of law that the defendants, rushing forward to assist their companion, should, under these circumstances, attempt the seizure of this powerful and desperate man with their naked hands, in the dark, without the ability, by reason of the conditions, to see the weapon and the manner in which it was being used?  Would not such a requirement put them in great danger of being themselves seriously wounded, even if it did not add to the danger of their companion?  It is the unquestioned law, and it should be rigorously enforced, that life can not be taken except in necessity, but it is as unquestioned that he who is in danger of his life from an assault, as well as the one who comes to his assistance, is not required to do anything which will increase his danger or enhance the opportunity of the aggressor to accomplish his end.  (U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Mack, 8 Phil. Rep., 701; U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Paras, 9 Phil. Rep., 367; supreme court of Spain, 25 September, 1875;  U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Herbert, 26 Fed. Cas., No. 15354a; State <i>vs.<\/i> Robertson, 50 La. Ann., 92; 25 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of L., 273.)  Moreover, if the life of Bumanglag was to be saved at all, the aggressor must be dealt with quickly and summarily.  Events were unrolling rapidly.  There was a life in danger, every instant becoming more imminent.  There was no time to think; no time for deliberate, careful judgment and nice precision; no opportunity to devise means or lay plans.  Under such circumstances the law does not hold men to the standards of careful  thought and calm judgment.  (Allen <i>vs.<\/i> U. S., 150 U. S., 551; State <i>vs.<\/i> West, 45 La. Ann., 14, 23; Brownell <i>vs.<\/i> People, 38 Mich., 732; supreme court of Spain, 7 December, 1886; Viada, Penal Code, vol. 1, 157-160.)<br\/><br\/>In order to make perfectly available the defense that they were rightfully defending Bumanglag, and that the means they employed were reasonably necessary, it is not essential that there should be absolute and positive danger to the person whose protection is attempted.  If there is a well-grounded and reasonable belief that the person is in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm, an attempt to defend him by means which appear reasonably necessary is justifiable.  The reasonable appearance is the important thing.  (Shorter <i>vs.<\/i> People, 2 N. Y., 193, 197; Brown <i>vs.<\/i> Com., 86 Va., 466; Logue <i>vs.<\/i> Com., 38 Pa. St., 265; Murray <i>vs.<\/i> Com., 79 Pa. St., 311, 317; Pond <i>vs.<\/i> People, 8 Mich., 149, 150; Hurd <i>vs.<\/i> People, 25 Mich., 404, 405; People <i>vs.<\/i> Miles, 55 Cal., 207; People <i>vs.<\/i> Herbert, 61 Cal., 544; Campbell <i>vs.<\/i> People, 16 I11., 17; Enlow <i>vs.<\/i> State, 154 Ind., 664; Hubbard <i>vs.<\/i> State, 37 Fla., 156; Alvarez <i>vs.<\/i> State, 37 Fla., 156; Oliver <i>vs.<\/i> State, 17 Ala., 587; Stewart <i>vs.<\/i> State, 1 Ohio St., 6Q, 71; 25 Am. &amp;  Eng. Ency. of Law, 262, 263; U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Paras, 9 Phil. Rep., 367.)<br\/><br\/>In deciding this case we must, therefore, under the law, put ourselves in the position of the defendants at the time of the event.  It is from their point of view that they are to be judged.<br\/><br\/>If they honestly believed, and had apparently reasonable grounds for that belief, that  the life of their companion was in imminent danger or that he was likely to suffer great bodily harm, and that the means which they used to protect him were reasonably necessary to that end, they can not be convicted.  (Viada, Penal Code, vol. 1, 98; People <i>vs.<\/i> Bruggy, 93 Cal., 476; Harris <i>vs.<\/i> State, 96 Ala., 24; U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Outerbridge, 5 Sawy.  (U. S. Circ), 620.)  I am convinced that the facts and circumstances of this case were sufficient to induce and support the belief in the minds of the defendants that their companion's life was in imminent danger and that the means which they employed were reasonably necessary to secure his protection.  (Supreme court of Spain, 2 January, 1873; 5 April, 1873; 30 April, 1874; 31 May, 1879; 17 March, 1885; 26 November, 1886; 26 November, 1886; 2 March, 1888; 4 April, 1889; 5 July, 1890; 6 December, 1890; 30 December, 1890; 11 February, 1896; 9 December, 1896; 24 May, 1898; 28 May, 1898; 10 December, 1898; 15 November, 1899; 9 January, 1900; 1 June, 1901; 16 April, 1902; 3 January, 1903; 14 January, 1903; 20 March, 1903; 11 July, 1909; 26 October, 1904; 17 November, 1904; 20 October, 1904; 29 October, 1904; 8 March, 1905.)  In other words, it would seem under all the circumstances, that it can not fairly be charged that the defendants, particularly the appellant, acted otherwise than as reasonable men would have acted in the same situation; and after all this is the real test.  (Allen <i>vs.<\/i> U. S., 150 U. S., 551; Hickory <i>vs.<\/i> U. S., 151 U. S., 303; Christian <i>vs.<\/i> State, 96 Ala., 89; People <i>vs.<\/i> Hurley, 8 Cal., 390; Gainey <i>vs.<\/i> People, 97 111., 270; State <i>vs.<\/i> West, 45 La. Ann., 14.)<br\/><br\/>While most of the authorities above cited refer to self-defense only, the principles they enunciate are fully applicable to the case  at bar, because, generally speaking, what one may do in his own defense another may do for him.  (25 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 274, and cases there cited.)<br\/><br\/>Under the circumstances of this case I can not feel that the fair and impartial administration of justice requires that we should refine doctrines, draw uncertain distinctions, invoke doubtful presumptions, employ fine analyses, or seize upon equivocal circumstances for the purpose of convicting the appellant of homicide, or for the purpose of establishing a doctrine which may have as a result that a criminal, invading his neighbors' premises feloniously and in the nighttime for the purpose of robbery, and surprised and taken in his wanton act, may feel that he is in any way or to any degree privileged under the law when, in attempting to make his outrage against man and society secure from detection and punishment, he seeks by every means in his power to destroy the life of his discover.  Every man ought to lend his hand in assisting society to apprehend and punish offenders against its institutions and laws, and while the wanton or illegal destruction of human life, under the guise of such assistance, ought to be promptly, vigorously, and unrelentingly punished, still, where such person, acting in the honest belief that he is saving the life of one who is viciously attacked by a criminal whose recognition or apprehension is attempted, in the defense of such person, causes the death of the criminal, the court ought not to be drawn from its usual, even and steady course in order to provide a punishment.  (Supreme court of Spain, 5 February, 1887; Viada, Penal Code, vol. 1,160,161.)<br\/><br\/>This court has gone very far in the direction of liberality in laying down the principles governing the defense of self-defense and the means that may be legally employed to make that defense effective-very much further, indeed, than it is necessary to go to absolve the appellant in the case at bar.  In the case of the United States <i>vs.<\/i> Patala (2 Phil. Rep., 752), the court says, page 756:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"It appears from the testimony of the defendant that at the time of the occurrence he was cleaning fish on board the steamship <i>Compa\u00f1ia de Filipinas<\/i>; that without any provocation on his  part the deceased, who was the cook of the boat, believing that some of the fish was missing, slapped him and kicked him; that not being satisfied with this, when the defendant started to run away from him, the deceased pursued him and attacked him with a knife; that the defendant, taking advantage of some favorable chance during the struggle, succeeded in wresting the knife from the deceased and  inflicted upon him a wound in the left side, from the result of which he died a few hours later.<br\/><br\/>\"* * *  The aggression on the part of the deceased was in every respect unjustified, and the defendant had a perfect right to repel the attack in the most adequate from within his power under the <i>critical circumstances of a sudden assault<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>\"* * *  He had reason to believe  that he was placed in the alternative of killing or being killed when he was being attacked and pursued with a deadly weapon.  This was the only weapon used during the struggle and it necessary had to be either in his possession or in the hands of the deceased.  If through a fortunate accident he came into possession of the knife, he could have lost control of it through a similar accident and then found himself at the mercy of his assailant.  Therefore the act of the defendant rendering his assailant powerless as well as he could under the critical circumstances of the moment, and repelling his aggression, constitute, in our opinion, a true case of self-defense, which exempts the defendant from any criminal liability under paragraph 4 of article 8 of the Penal Code.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>The same doctrine is laid down in the similar case of the United States <i>vs.<\/i> Salandanan (1 Phil. Rep., 478).  (See also U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Brello, Phil. Rep., 424; U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Reyes, 1 Phil. Rep., 517; U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Bailon, 9 Phil. Rep., 161.)<br\/><br\/>There is neither claim nor evidence that any of the defendants were actuated in their defense of Bumanglag by revenge, resentment, or other illegal motive, and from this point of view the case requires no discussion.<br\/><br\/>As to the question of reasonable doubt.<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"In discussing the questions of burden of proof and reasonable doubt in cases involving self-defense, the courts have stated various confusing and apparently contradictory propositions, but the general rule deducible from the authorities seems to be that when the prosecution has made a <i>prima facie<\/i> case against the accused, it is for him to introduce evidence showing self-defense, if he sets up that plea; but that if, upon the whole testimony, both on the part of the State and the accused, the jury has a reasonable doubt whether he acted in self-defense or not, he is entitled to the benefit of the doubt and to an acquittal.\"  (25 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 283.)<\/blockquote><br\/>The doctrine above stated is fully supported by the authorities.<br\/><br\/>In the case of Lillienthal <i>vs.<\/i> United States (97 U. S., 237, 266), the court said:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"In criminal cases the true rule is that the burden of proof never shifts; that, in all cases, before a conviction can be had, the jury must be satisfied from the evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, of the affirmative of the issue presented in the accusation, that the defendant is guilty in the manner and form as charged in the indictment.  * * *  Where the matter of excuse or justification of the offense charged grows out of the original transaction, the defense is not driven to the necessity of establishing the matter in excuse or justification by a preponderance of the evidence, and hiuch less beyond a reasonable doubt.  If, upon a consideration of all the evidence, there be a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the party, the jury are to give him the benefit of such doubt.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>To the same effect are Tweedy <i>vs.<\/i> State (5 Iowa, 433); Wharton's Criminal Evidence, p. 236; Tiffany <i>vs.<\/i> Commonwealth (121 Pa. St., 165); People <i>vs.<\/i> Coughlin (65 Mich., 704).<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"The section casts upon the defendant the burden of proving circumstances of mitigation, or that justify or excuse the commission of the homicide.  This does not mean that he must prove such circumstances <i>by a preponderance of the evidence<\/i>, but that the presumption that the killing was felonious arises from the mere proof by the prosecution of the homicide, and the burden of proving circumstances of mitigation, etc., is thereby cast upon him.  He is only bound under this rule to produce such evidence as will create in the minds of the jury a reasonable doubt of his guilt of the offense charged.\"  (People <i>vs.<\/i> Flanagan, 60 Cal., 3; 44 Am. Rep., 52; People <i>vs.<\/i> Smith, 59 Cal, 607.) \"It can make no difference whether this reasonable doubt is the result of evidence on the part of the defendant tending to show circumstances  of mitigation, or that justify or excuse the killing,  or from other evidence coming from him or the prosecution.  The well-settled rule that a defendant shall not be convicted unless the evidence proves his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt applies to the whole and every material part of the case, no matter whether it is as to the act of killing, or the reason for or manner of its commission.\"  (People <i>vs.<\/i> Bushton, 80 Cal., 160, 164; Alexander <i>vs.<\/i> People, 96 111., 96; People <i>vs.<\/i> Riordan, 117 N. Y., 71.)<\/blockquote><br\/>Reading the evidence in this case in the light of reason and of the principles enunciated by the courts, I can not but feel that, under all the circumstances, there is a strong doubt of the appellant's legal responsibility for the crime charged.  In my opinion, therefore, the judgment of the court below should be reversed and the appellant acquitted.<\/div>",

TAN TAYCO AND CO SENCHO, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>CARSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">This is an appeal from a judgment convicting the appellants, Tan Tayco and Co Sencho, of a violation of the provisions of section 7 of Act No. 1761 (Opium Law), and sentencing them, and each of them, to a fine of P500, or in case of insolvency, to the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment prescribed in such cases, and to the payment of the costs of the trial.<br\/><br\/>On the night of the 30th day of November, 1907, in the municipality of Ormoc, Province of Leyte, the municipal treasurer,\u00a0 accompanied by a policeman, found various utensils, used for smoking opium, including a lamp and a pipe, in a store owned by one of the defendants,\u00a0 Tan Tayco, and his partner, Andres T. Avila.\u00a0 These utensils were found near or under Avila's bed in the room occupied by him jointly with the defendant Co Sencho, who was employed as an assistant in the store.\u00a0 This room connected with the room occupied by the defendant, Tan Tayco, by a small passageway.<br\/><br\/>The discovery of these utensils was conclusively established by the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution, and was not denied by the defendants, who admitted that they were not authorized under the provisions of section 7 of the Opium Law to have such utensils in their possession.\u00a0 But they denied the allegation of the information, that these utensils were in their possession or control at the time of their discovery, claiming that they were the property of Andres Avila, one of the coproprietors of the store.\u00a0 Avila admitted that he was the owner of the utensils in question, but swore that at the time of their discovery he was in Cebu, where he had gone on business not long before the seizure; that he had left for Cebu prior to the passage\u00a0 of Act No. 1761; that at the time when he left for Cebu he held a license, under the provisions of Act No. 1.461, whereby he was authorized to smoke opium, and to have in his possession the utensils for smoking opium which were found in his room; that not anticipating the passage of Act No. 1761, he left the implements in question in the tray in his room; and that his partner, Tan Tayco, and their employee in the store, Co Sencho, had no interest\u00a0 whatever in the ownership or control of these utensils.<br\/><br\/>The prosecution introduced three witnesses who testified that the defendant, Tan Tayco, was the real owner of the pipe and other utensils in question, and that they had seen Tan Tayco smoking opium\u00a0 with the pipe on various occasions in the months of August, September, and October, 1907.<br\/><br\/>Defendants introduced evidence which tended to show that these three witnesses were professional gamblers with no occupation or visible means of support, and wholly unworthy of credit or belief; Tan Tayco and his partner, Avila, declaring that on various occasions these witnesses had begged them for opium and for permission to smoke it, and that when their request was denied they became angered, and testified falsely at the trial in a spirit of revenge.<br\/><br\/>Section 7 of Act No. 1761 is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"(<i>a<\/i>)\u00a0 Except upon the prescription of a duly licensed and practicing physician or upon lawful permit of the Collector of Internal Revenue, it shall be unlawful for any person not a duly licensed and practicing physician, pharmacist, second-class pharmacist, licensed dispensator of opium, or a duly registered user of opium, when using the same in a licensed opium dispensary only and in such quantities as may be stated in his certificate, to have in his possession opium, or any pipes, hypodermic syringes, or other apparatus or paraphernalia to be used for smoking, injecting, or using opium in any manner.<br\/><br\/>\"(<i>b<\/i>)\u00a0 Any person violating the provisions of this section shall be punished by a fine not exceeding five hundred pesos or by imprisonment for a period not exceeding one year, or by both such fine and imprisonment, in the discretion of the court:\u00a0 <i>Provided<\/i>, That all opium, pipes, and other opium apparatus and\u00a0 paraphernalia found in the possession of any person not authorized to have same shall be seized and forfeited to the Government.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Defendants on appeal attacked the constitutionality of this section on the ground that its enactment was in violation of the provisions of section 5 of the Philippine Bill, which provides that no person shall be deprived of his life, liberty, or property\u00a0 without due process of law.\u00a0 Appellants contend that opium is a beneficial and wholesome medicine; that to deprive one of such medicine who might have need thereof would inflict serious injury upon his health; and that the provision of the Opium Law which forbids the having of utensils for smoking opium in one's possession is an infringement on the personal liberty of the citizen, which is guaranteed to the people of these Islands by the terms of the Philippine Bill.<br\/><br\/>We do not deem it necessary to discuss this question at length in this case, because we are convinced that the evidence offered by the prosecution is not sufficient to sustain a judgment of conviction.\u00a0 It may not be improper, however, to indicate that it is a fact of general knowledge, not seriously questioned by thinking men, that the habitual use of opium to excess is a vice degrading and disgusting in its tendencies, and pernicious and dangerous to a degree in its effect, mental, moral, and physical, upon the individual addicted thereto.\u00a0 We think, therefore, that there can be no doubt of the power of the legislature to determine for itself whether the indiscriminate use of this drug is or is not marked by consequences dangerous to the welfare of the general public, so as to necessitate and justify control of its use as a medicine or otherwise, under such restrictions as the legislature\u00a0 may deem necessary to prevent its abuse.<br\/><blockquote>\"But it is urged by the defense that a moderate use of opium, or that the moderate use of an opium pipe, is not deleterious, and consequently can not be prohibited.\u00a0 We answer that this is a question of fact, which can only be inquired into by the legislature.\u00a0 Smoking opium is a recognized evil in this country.\u00a0 It is a matter of general information that it is an insidious and dangerous vice, a loathsome, disgusting, and degrading habit, that is becoming dangerously common with the,youth of the country, and that its usual concomitants are imbecility, pauperism and crime.\u00a0 It has been regarded as a proper subject of legislation in every Western State.\"\u00a0 (Territory of Washington <i>vs<\/i>. Ah Lim, 9 L. R. A., 395, 397.)<br\/><br\/>\"The sale and disposition of such a drug may unquestionably be regulated and controlled by law, and whether its nature and character are such that, for the protection of the public, its possession by unauthorized persons should be prohibited, is a question of fact and of public policy, which belongs to the legislative department to determine.\u00a0 The discretion of the legislature in the employment of means which are reasonably calculated to protect the health, morals, or safety of the public is very great; and so long as it does not infringe upon the inherent rights of life, liberty, and property, either directly or\u00a0 through some limitations upon the means of living or some material right essential to the enjoyment of life, its determination is conclusive upon the courts.\"\u00a0 (Mon Luck <i>vs<\/i>. Sears, 32 L. B. A., 738, 739; State <i>vs<\/i>. Ah Chew, 10 Nev., 50, 40 Am. Rep., 488; <i>In re<\/i> Yung Jon, 28 Fed. Rep., 308.)<br\/><\/blockquote>The discovery of the pipe and other utensils at the time and place above indicated tends strongly to support the contention of the prosecution that they were found in the possession of one or both of these defendants, but it is not conclusive evidence as to that fact.<br\/><br\/>Possession has been defined to be the detention or enjoyment of a thing which a man holds or exercises by himself or by another who keeps or exercises it in his name.\u00a0 (Bouvier's Law Dictionary, Rawles' revision, Vol. II.)\u00a0 Clearly it involves a state of mind on the part of the possessor whereby he intends to exercise, and as a consequence of which, he does exercise a right of possession,\u00a0 whether that right be legal or otherwise; and while the intention and the will to possess may be, and usually are inferred from the fact that the thing in question is under the apparent power and control of the alleged\u00a0 possessor, nevertheless, the existence of the<i> animus possidendi<\/i> is subject to contradiction, and may be rebutted by evidence which tends to prove that the person under whose power and control the thing in question appears to be, does not in fact exercise such power of control and does not intend so to do.\u00a0 In order to complete a possession two things are required,\u00a0 that there be an occupancy, apprehension, or taking; that the taking be with an intent to possess (<i>animus possidendi<\/i>). Hence persons who have no legal wills, as children of insufficient understanding and idiots, cannot possess or acquire a complete possession\u00a0 (Pothier, Etienne, see 1 Mer., 358; Abb. Sh., 9); so where stolen property is placed in the house or upon the premises of A, without his knowledge or consent, A is not properly speaking in possession of such property, so long as he does not assert a right to its control, and is not moved by the <i>animus possidendi<\/i> with reference thereto.<br\/><br\/>The statements of the witness Avila, if they can be believed, furnish a full, satisfactory, and sufficient explanation of the presence of the utensils for smoking opium in his house at the time of their seizure, which is entirely consistent with the allegations of the defendant that those utensils were not at that time in their possession; and, therefore, entirely consistent with the innocence of the defendants charged with a violation of the provisions of the above-cited section of the Opium Act.<br\/><br\/>The trial judge was of opinion that the witness\u00a0 Avila was a perjurer and testified falsely, basing his opinion upon the self-contradictory character of the testimony of this witness, which, in his opinion, left no room for doubt that this testimony was false and unworthy\u00a0 of belief.\u00a0 We do not think that the evidence of record establishes this finding of the trial court beyond a reasonable doubt.\u00a0 The only statement of a self-contradictory character which we find in the testimony of this witness is that pointed out by the trial judge.<br\/><br\/>The first question asked the witness upon direct examination\u00a0 and his answer thereto were as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Q. Look at these articles\u00a0 marked Exhibits A, B, C, and I); what are they used for, and who is the owner of them?-A.\u00a0 All the\u00a0 articles here are used for smoking opium with the exception of this bamboo (the\u00a0 pipe in question); the rest are mine.\u00a0 I say it is not mine because the metal which gives it strength is not of the same shape as that on mine.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Upon cross-examination by the provincial fiscal, the witness testified as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Q. But this pipe, Exhibit A, is not your pipe?-A.\u00a0 It appears like my pipe, but there are so many\u00a0 pipes that look alike.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Answer the question, is this your pipe or not?-A.\u00a0 Yes, sir; it is.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Then why did you say before that it was not yours?-A.\u00a0 Because it is very dirty, and as there are other pipes that look like it, I did not say it was mine.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Now tell the truth, is it not true that just a few moments ago you stated this pipe was not yours because your pipe has a different-shaped piece of metal than that which is on this pipe?-A.\u00a0 I stated before that it was not the same because it is very dirty.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Did you not say that it was not yours because the metal was different?-A.\u00a0 But I remember now that it is mine.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. State whether or not you said the metal on your pipe was different?-A.\u00a0 I said that before.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. What has caused you to change your mind about the metal?-A.\u00a0 The difference is that the metal is round which caused me to doubt its being mine.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Then you have changed your mind and decided that it is yours?-A.\u00a0 Yes, sir; because I know it is round.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. What about the metal?\u00a0 Has it changed its appearance since you made the statement?-A.\u00a0 It has not changed since then.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Then you are quite sure that it is your pipe, are you?-A.\u00a0 Yes, sir.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. No doubt about it at all?-A.\u00a0 No, sir; there is no doubt.<br\/><br\/>\"FISCAL.\u00a0 Is it not true that before you answered the question, when you were asked about recognizing the pipe, you examined the pipe for more than ten seconds before you answered and said, it was not your pipe?<br\/><br\/>\"A.\u00a0 Yes, sir; because I did not recognize it at first glance because it is very dirty.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Answer the question, is it not true that you carefully examined the pipe before you stated that it was not yours?\u00a0 This is-on your direct examination.-A.\u00a0 It is true that I examined it, but I did not recognize it immediately because it is a long time since I have seen it.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>We do not think that the fact that the witness, upon due reflection and consideration, and after a careful and extended examination of the pipe, corrected his first statement in regard thereto, is proof conclusive that his statements as modified were false and unworthy of credit.\u00a0 It will be observed that he appears to have modified his testimony under the rigid cross-examination of the prosecution when his attention was especially directed to the question of ownership of the exhibit which was placed in his hand.\u00a0 If he was indeed a deliberate perjurer and went upon the stand for the purpose of willfully testifying falsely, it would seem more reasonable that he should have claimed the ownership of the pipe under the examination of counsel for the defendant, rather than that fact so essential to the defense should have developed upon cross-examination, at a time when, without the aid of the prosecution, it could not have been established otherwise.\u00a0\u00a0 It may well be that at first glance the witness was mistaken as to the identity of the pipe, which had been out of his possession for many months, during which the metal finishing might have become tarnished, either in the store where he left it, or in the hands of the officers of the law\u00a0 who\u00a0 held it after its seizure.\u00a0 It appears that Act No. 1761 was not in force when this witness left Cebu, and that at that time he held a license which authorized him to smoke opium and to have in his possession and under his control the necessary utensils for that purpose.\u00a0 There is nothing incredible in his statements that he left the pipe in question in his room, expecting to find it there upon his return, and we think that, giving to the defendants the benefit of the\u00a0 doubt, the testimony of this witness should be accepted as true.<br\/><br\/>The testimony of the three witnesses for the prosecution, who declared that they had seen the defendants smoking the pipe in question on various occasions, if it could be believed, would cast\u00a0 grave doubt upon the truth of the declarations of the witnesses for the defense.\u00a0 We think, however, that the uncontradicted evidence as to the character of these witnesses, taken together with the evidence tending to prove that they were actuated in testifying by a feeling of revenge, because the defendants refused to let them have opium or to smoke in their store after the passage of the Opium Law, is sufficient to justify us in rejecting their testimony.\u00a0 One of these witnesses admitted on the stand that he had begged Tan Tayeo to let him smoke opium in his store, and that Tan Tnyco had refused to grant his request, and taking into consideration the worthless character of these witnesses, their suspicious mode of living, the fact that\u00a0 they had no known means of gaining a lawful livelihood, and the fact that, under the law, informers receive a share in the fine inflicted upon violators of the Opium Law, we feel compelled to hold the statements of these witnesses as unworthy of credit and belief.<br\/><br\/>The judgment and sentence of the trial court should be and are hereby reversed, and the defendants acquitted of the offense with which they are charged, with the costs in both instances <i>de oficio<\/i>.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano C.

This appears in a document signed by the accused and bearing his seal of office.<\/p> <p>Up to the 5th of July, 1907, when the accused was arrested as a result of the aforesaid complaint, the said amount had not been paid for the purpose already stated. It was only on the 31st day of said month that he called at the provincial treasury of Occidental Negros in order to settle the indebtedness of Sebastian Olvido for the year 1903, with the result that the latter then owed for the tax, surtax, and interest the sum of P12.66 which the accused paid into the municipal treasury of Cadiz Nuevo. The said total of P12.66 was the amount due up to the 1st of August, 1907, when the settlement was made. Thus, as remarked by the Attorney-General in this instance, the 6 per cent interest charged for delinquency corresponds to the forty-three months which elapsed from the 1st of January, 1904, to the 1st of August, 1907, while if the tax and surtax had been paid in 1904, Sebastian Olvido would only have had to pay the sum of P10.42.<\/p> <p>The accused gave the following explanation:<\/p> <blockquote> <p>\"Q. Here is this document marked 'Exhibit A;' do you know what it is?\u2014A. It is a receipt for an amount corresponding to the tax due by Sebastian Olvido.<\/p> <p>\"Q. By whom is it signed?\u2014A. By me, and because, sir, as it was not the exact amount due, because he owed P12.66, they refused to issue the proper receipt from the treasury until the total amount was forthcoming, and so he was notified, and before going to live in Silay I informed him that I was about to leave.<\/p> <p>\"Q. And when you received said amount of P7.42 which Sebastian Olvido handed you to pay for his land tax, did you not call his attention to the fact that it was not sufficient, and that it was not the amount that was due for the tax that he had to pay?\u2014A. I did so because I had a note from the treasurer stating that he had to pay P12.66, and he told me to come back within a week when he would make up the difference.\"<\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>It is evident that this fact could not have been brought to the attention of Sebastian Olvido in 1903, when he could not have owed more than P10.42, but on the first of August, 1907, when in addition he finally owed on account of interest of the delinquency a total of P12.66.<\/p> <p>The trial court did not punish the deed as misappropriation of public funds but as <em>estafa<\/em> under the provisions of article 534, paragraph 1, of the Penal Code, and sentenced the accused to two months and one day of <em>arresto mayor,<\/em> and to pay the costs.<\/p> <p>In this instance the Attorney-General is, however, of opinion that the accused should be punished under article 399 of the Penal Code, and that he should be further sentenced to temporary special disqualification, thus applying the doctrine established in the cause of the United States <em>vs<\/em>. Solis (7 Phil. Rep., 195).<\/p> <p>According to the facts as proven the above doctrine can not be applied in this case.<\/p> <p>The record shows that Mijares had not requested Olvido to hand him any sum whatever, either as deputy sheriff or as a private individual; nor that Olvido appeared as a delinquent taxpayer in the list which Mijares kept for collection; the fact is that on said occasion Olvido simply availed himself of the opportunity to settle up his tax, and asked Mijares to deposit in the municipal treasury the aforesaid sum of P7.42.<\/p> <p>Such being the facts in the case, the accused, upon merely receiving the request to make a deposit, did not act as a public official nor in any way abuse his office; he acted as might any other private individual to whom Olvido might have made such a request, and who might or might not have faithfully discharged such a request. This is the sense in which the trial court has considered the offense.<\/p> <p>It therefore follows that the doctrine applicable herein is that established in the case of the United States <em>vs<\/em>. Casin (8 Phil. Rep., 589). As a private individual only is he guilty of the crime of <em>estafa<\/em>.<\/p> <p>Therefore, the judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed, with the costs of this instance.<\/p> <p><em>Torres, Johnson, Carson,<\/em> and <em>Moreland, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<\/p><\/div>",

that the debtor, in order to guarantee payment, mortgaged to the creditor certain lands owned by him situated in a place called Calasa, in the barrio, of Cabancalan, the area of which appears in title No. 6750, recorded at the <i>Inspeccion General de Montes<\/i>, and entered in the registry of property of the said province under No.\u00a0 144, letter A; and that, notwithstanding the demands made by the creditor, the defendant debtor had not satisfied debt, for which reason he prayed that judgment be rendered against the same, sentencing him to pay the aforesaid sum with legal interest thereon and costs, together with any other just and equitable remedy.<br\/><br\/>The defendant appeared by his counsel and answered the complaint, denying each and everyone of the paragraphs of the same, but three months after filing, another attorney amended the answer by a writing dated November 26, 1907, setting forth:\u00a0 That he denied each and everyone of the allegations contained in the aforesaid complaint with the exception of those which he admits as true in his amended answer, and which are as follows:\u00a0 That the defendant owed the late Jose Ramos a certain sum of money, apparently the same as that claimed in the complaint, for which he gave his promissory note; that this note appears to be\u00a0 the one referred to in the second paragraph of the\u00a0 complaint; that after the execution of the promissory note, that is to say, on the 1st of May, 1905, the defendant paid the plaintiff the sum of P1,701.69 on account of his\u00a0 indebtedness, and that the defendant has not refused, nor does he now refuse to pay the actual amount that he owes, and therefore, he prayed the court below to hold that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover the total value of the said promissory note, that by reason of said last payment, the said document was renewed be novation and that the defendant be finally absolved from payment of the excess that appears from the complaint, with the costs against the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>As the defendant did not appear at the trial, the court below entered judgment by default on the 23d of January, 1908, and sentenced the defendant to pay the amount claimed with the legal interest thereon from the 26th of July, 1907, and costs.<br\/><br\/>On the 24th of said month, counsel for the defendant requested the\u00a0 court, in view of the facts alleged in his petition, to vacate the judgment in default entered against the defendant, and grant him an opportunity to produce evidence and to contest the complaint; on the 25th of the\" same month the court below set aside the previous judgment entered in default, and ordered the trial to be continued.<br\/><br\/>At the trial, evidence was adduced by both parties, and the documents exhibited by them were made of record; on February 11,1908, the court below, sustaining its previous decision of January 23, sentenced the defendant to pay the plaintiff the sum of P2,450.09, and legal interest thereon from July 26, 1907, and costs.\u00a0 The defendant excepted to this judgment and moved for a new trial on the ground that the judgment was contrary to the evidence adduced at the trial and to the law; his motion was overruled, to which the petitioner excepted, and presented the corresponding bill of exceptions which was approved and submitted to this court.<br\/><br\/>As the plaintiff claims payment of the sum of P2,450.09, set out in the promissory note offered by him in evidence at the trial as Exhibit 1, the real point to be determined in this case, as the defendant says in his brief, is whether or not he has paid, on account of his debt, the sum of P1,701.69, as he alleged in his answer.<br\/><br\/>From the documents offered in evidence by both parties and from the affidavit of the defendant, Tomas Ledesma, it is inferred that between the years 1894 and 1902, the latter contracted various debts, firstly with Jose Ramos Silva, now deceased, and afterwards with his brother, Martin Ramos, administrator of the estate of the deceased creditor; and though some of said debts have been duly paid, as proven by the documents returned by the creditor or by the administrator of the estate to the defendant debtor, who produced them at the trial, it does not appear, however, that the debt of P2,450.09 set out in the promissory note No. 1, presented by the plaintiff, has been paid either in part or in whole by the defendant debtor.<br\/><br\/>The latter alleges that he paid the plaintiff, on account of the debt appearing in said promissory note No. 1, the sum of P1,701.69, and to prove his assertion he submitted, together with other documents, those lettered A and D.\u00a0 The latter document is literally as follows :<br\/><blockquote>\"For the sum of $1,701.69.-I hereby promise to pay Se\u00f1or Martin Ramos, as administrator of the estate of his deceased brother Se\u00f1or Jose Ramos, on the 15th day of March, 1901, the\u00a0 sum of one thousand seven hundred and one and sixty-nine cents ($1,701.69), and to secure the payment of this sum I hereby mortgage certain lands owned by me situated in the sitio of 'Calasa' with an area of 41 hectares, 74 ares and 78 centares within the limits of this town, according to the title No. 6750\u00a0 registered at the <i>Inspeccion General de Montes<\/i> No. 1591, recorded in the registry of property under No. 144, letter A, which land is free from all encumbrances.\u00a0 And in witness thereof I sign these presents in Cabancalan on the 29th day of June, 1900.\u00a0 (Signed) Tomas Ledesma.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The document lettered A and cited above, reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"I have received from Sr. Tomas Ledesma, resident of Cabancalan, the sum of one thousand seven hundred pesos sixty-nine cents, in paper money of the Banco Espa\u00f1ol Filipino and gold and silver Conant money, which sum be pays in settlement of his debt to my deceased brother D. Jose Ramos under guaranty of his land situated\u00a0 in the sitio of Calasa within the limits of the town of Cabancalan according to a private document which I this day return to the interested party, with the exception of his <i>titulo real<\/i> and the promissory\u00a0 note for two thousand four hundred and fifty-nine pesos and sixty-nine cents, which are in the hands of Sr. Timoteo Gayco, son-in-law of the said deceased.\u00a0 In witness whereof and for the security of the interested party I issue the present in Jimamaylan on this\u00a0 the first day of May, nineteen hundred and five.\u00a0 (Signed)\u00a0 M. Ramos.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>A simple perusal of this last document demonstrates in an unquestionable manner that Martin Ramos, administrator of the estate of Jose Ramos and wife, upon receiving from the debtor\u00a0 Tomas Ledesma the sum of P1,701.69, gave him the foregoing receipt marked A, and in addition thereto returned the document or promissory note marked D in which the debt paid by the defendant is set out.<br\/><br\/>In the aforesaid Exhibit A it does not appear that the sum of P1,701.69, paid in by the debtor Ledesma was received by Martin Ramos in part payment of a larger sum, separate and distinct from that evidenced by the promissory note D; this note was returned to him on the spot because the debt which it represented was thereby paid; therefore, judging from the essential part of the contents of the said Exhibit A, the amount therein stated as received was in payment of the debt contained in the promissory note D; not as part payment of a larger sum contained in the other promissory note, No. 1, the collection of which is the object of this litigation.<br\/><br\/>The rest of the statements of Martin Ramos, who made out the receipt, that the <i>titulo real<\/i> and the larger promissory note were not returned, is no proof that the payment of the debt set out in the promissory note D was made on account of the promissory note\u00a0 No, 1, which calls for another separate debt of P2,450.09.\u00a0 It is only by the tergiversation of the natural sense and meaning of each one of the three documents mentioned that it could be held that the said P1,701.69 were paid and received on account of the debt claimed.<br\/><br\/>It is incontestable that the amount expressed in the promissory note marked D, dated June 29, 1900, and that contained in note No. 1 of May 13, 1902, are two distinct debts, and even though Ledesma avers that\u00a0 he mortgaged his land, situated in a place called \"Calasa,\" as security for both, the circumstance that one piece of property was given as security for the payment of both\u00a0 debts does not prove that the latter constituted one sole obligation, nor that the payment of the smaller amount should be understood to be in part payment of the larger.\u00a0 This would be absurd, it being proven that prior to May 1, 1905, the defendant Ledesma was indebted to the estate of Jose Ramos and wife for two sums which had not been settled, so that the payment of the amount stated in promissory note D can in no manner be considered to have been made in part payment of note No. 1.<br\/><br\/>The fact that said document was in the hands of the creditor at the time when the complaint was filed proves that the amount therein stated had not yet been satisfied, since it can only be assumed that an obligation has been paid when the evidence of its existence has been returned to the debtor.\u00a0 (Art. 334, No. 8, Code of Civil Procedure.)<br\/><br\/>It is true that the defendant avers that he made a partial payment on account of the debt claimed herein, and it might be said that for this reason the promissory note No. 1 was not returned to the debtor; but it is none the less true that the receipt marked A given by the administrator, Martin Ramos, sets out the payment of P1,701.69 by the debtor, Ledesma, which sum he owed the late Jose Ramos according to the document or promissory not marked D; that note was at once returned to him, and it contained no statement or indication that such payment was on account of the P2,450.09 to which promissory note No. 1 refers, and furthermore there is no proof of such circumstance in the record, or that the debt evidenced by the aforesaid promissory note D was included in the other note, marked No. 1, and which evidences a different debt and for which action is brought for lack of payment.<br\/><br\/>Article 1156 of the Civil Code says that obligations are extinguished by their payment or fulfillment; a debt shall only be considered as paid when the full amount of the thing has been delivered, or\u00a0 the prestation of which the obligation consisted has\u00a0 been made.\u00a0 (Art. 1157.)<br\/><br\/>The supreme court of Spain, taking intov consideration the precept of article 1162 of said code in its decision of February\u00a0 9, 1898, established the following rule:<br\/><blockquote>\"When the debt for which action is brought arises from obligations other than those appearing as paid in the receipt by which it is intended to prove payment, a judgment finding that said debt is paid is in violation of the said article 1162.\" <\/blockquote> In view of the above-quoted legal precepts and the doctrine laid down in the said judgment in harmony therewith, the payment proven by the receipt marked A, for the sum due on the promissory note marked D, can not be considered as part payment of the sum claimed by the plaintiff under the promissory note No. 1, for the reason that they constitute two different debts, arising from different obligations of the defendant.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing considerations and those set forth in the judgment appealed from, so far as they agree with this decision, the said judgment is hereby affirmed with costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

I., with the infraction of section 29 of Act No. 1582 of the Philippine Commission, known as the Election Law, committed as follows:<br\/><br\/>\"That about November 5, 1907, during the general elections held on the above-mentioned date in the municipality of Tayasan, Oriental Negros, P. I., Basilio Ganagganag, Domingo Gallosa, Leon Gantalao, Jorge Ganagganag, Rosendo Camion, Cosme Acabodillo, Tomas Granton,\u00a0 Francisco Garsula, Basilio Pacturan, Rosendo\u00a0 Fabillar, Alejandro

Andres Fabillar, Juan Fabillaran, Lucas Estumagulang, Julian Pongcol, Ca Pito Fundador, (Juan Pacturan) Francisco Absin, Zacarias Domin, Damian Pacolanang, Braulio Fabruada, Juan Gadiano,\u00a0 Policarpio Absin, Alejo Acabo, Ciriaco Vallener, Lorenzo Pacatang, Severino Alberto, Faustino Paconla, Osorio Alverto y Wenceslao\u00a0 Telabangco, duly qualified electors of the municipality of Tayasan, having the right to vote but not being able to fill out the ballots, some on account of not knowing how to write and others by reason of physical defects, designated the accused referred to, as being duly appointed and qualified election inspectors of the election district of the said municipality of Tayasan, in accordance with the said Election Law, to fill out their respective ballots, informing the said inspectors that they voted for Pio Banogon, Pedro Teves, and Jose G. de la Pe\u00f1a, as president of Tayasan, governor, and third member of the provincial\u00a0 board of Oriental Negros, respectively.<br\/><br\/>\"That the said accused, in filling out the ballots of the said electors, instead of writing in the names of Pio Banogon, Pedro Teves, and Jose G. de la Pe\u00f1a, for the offices above mentioned in conformity with the desires of the said electors, voluntarily and maliciously inserted in the said ballots the names of Benito Sanchez, Hermenegildo Villanueva, and Felix\u00a0 Montenegro, respectively, for the offices\u00a0 referred to, in this manner falsifying the votes of the said individuals and failing in their obligations as such election inspectors.<br\/><br\/>\"Committed within the jurisdiction of this court, contrary to law.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>On the 13th day of May, 1908, the defendants filed a demurrer in which it was alleged that the facts stated in the complaint did not constitute a violation of section 29 of Act\u00a0 No. 1582 of the Philippine Commission.<br\/><br\/>On the 26th\u00a0 day of May, 1908, the defendants filed an answer setting out at length various facts and in a general way denying the allegations of the complaint.\u00a0 No ruling was made by the lower court upon the effect of filing an answer in a criminal case by the defendants, after having presented a demurrer.\u00a0 The Attorney-General in this court undertakes to make the point that the answer having been presented before the demurrer, such demurrer could not be considered.\u00a0 He, however, overlooked the fact that the answer was not presented until after the demurrer had been presented.\u00a0 It is true that the answer was dated the 25th of March, 1908, but it was not filed with the court until the 26th of May, 1908, or after the filing of the demurrer.\u00a0 The answer such as was presented in this case can not be considered for the reason that it does not comply with section 24 of General Orders, No. 58.<br\/><br\/>Upon consideration of the said demurrer the lower court held that the facts stated in said complaint where not sufficient to constitute a crime and sustained the demurrer.\u00a0 From this ruling of the lower court the prosecuting attorney appealed.<br\/><br\/>From an examination of the complaint it will be noted that the following facts are alleged:<br\/><br\/>First.\u00a0 That the\u00a0 defendants were inspectors of election for the municipality of Tayasan of the Province of Oriental Negros.<br\/><br\/>Second.\u00a0 That on the 5th of November, 1907, certain persons whose names appear in the complaint, being legally qualified voters of said municipality, but being unable to write and thereby unable to prepare their ballots, requested the said defendants, as members of said election board, to assist them in the preparation of their ballots.<br\/><br\/>Third.\u00a0 That the said voters requested the defendants to write the names of certain designated candidates in the proper places on the ballots, but the defendants, willfully and maliciously, and with intent to defraud, wrote the names of persons other than those designated by the voters in said ballots.<br\/><br\/>Section 29 of Act No. 1582 provides :<br\/><blockquote>\"Any inspector * * * who is guilty of any fraud or corrupt conduct in the duties of his office, shall be punished by imprisonment for not less than one month nor more than one year, or by a fine of not less than two hundred pesos nor more than five hundred pesos, or both, in the discretion of the court.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Section 22 of said Act, among other things, contains the following provision:<br\/><blockquote>\"A voter otherwise qualified who declares that he can not write, or that from blindness or other physical disability he is unable to prepare his ballot, * * * and that he desires one or two of the inspectors named by him to assist him in the preparation of such ballot * * *.\u00a0 The inspector or inspectors so named as aforesaid shall retire with the voter and prepare his ballot according to his wishes.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Under said section it is made the express duty of the inspector, under the conditions named, to prepare the ballot of the voter according to his wishes.\u00a0 Under said section 29 it is further provided that-<br\/><blockquote>\"Any member of any board of inspectors * * * who willfully declines or fails to perform any duty or obligation imposed by this Act [No. 1582] shall be punished by imprisonment or by a fine.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>When the inspectors, as charged in the complaint, failed to write in\u00a0 the ballot the name or names expressly indicated by the voter, they thereby willfully failed to perform the duty or obligation imposed by said section 22.\u00a0 This failure to comply with their duty was a fraud practiced against the voter.\u00a0 Under section 29 if the inspector is guilty of any fraud or corrupt conduct in the performance of the duties of his office, he shall be punished, etc., by fine or imprisonment.<br\/><br\/>The complaint in the present case, in our opinion, clearly sets out facts, which if true, show a violation of the provisions of said section 29.\u00a0 The demurrer, therefore, should be overruled and it is so ordered.<br\/><br\/>After the expiration of ten days let the record be returned to the lower court with\u00a0 direction that the defendants be required to plead to the complaint filed in said cause.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

H. Lawrence was appointed counsel for the defense, and on the 9th of September, 1901, filed his brief.\u00a0 Thereafter, in response to an order issued by this court, dated November 8,1901, directing the ascertainment of the whereabouts of the defendants, the clerk of the Court of First Instance of Tayabas, on the 8th day of May, 1902, reported that he had been unable to secure the information desired by the court.\u00a0 No further proceedings appear to have been\u00a0 taken in the case until the 25th day of March, 1908, when the record was returned to the Court of First Instance, an order having\u00a0 been entered on the minutes directing the suspension of the proceedings because the whereabouts of the defendants was unknown, without prejudice to the reopening of the case in the event that the accused should present themselves or be arrested.\u00a0 On the 27th day of October, 1908, the record was returned to this court, with the information\u00a0 that the defendants had been arrested and released on bail and had formally entered an appeal from the judgment of the Spanish Court of First Instance.\u00a0 The case was finally submitted, upon the briefs of the Solicitor-General and counsel for the defendants, on the 13th day of July, 1909.<br\/><br\/>Waiving the irregularity of the proceedings involved in the so-called appeal entered by the defendants, we think the case may fairly be taken to be submitted to us <i>en consulta<\/i>, under the provisions of section 38 of Act No. 136, both the Government and the defendants having had full opportunity to be heard, and the fact that such appeal was entered in nowise affecting the substantial rights of either party.<br\/><br\/>The complaining witness alleged that he delivered to the defendant, Domingo Desa, cocoanuts valued at P22.75, the property of his father, with the obligation to convert the said cocoanuts into coprax and return the same for an agreed remuneration, but that Desa had failed to deliver the coprax in accordance with his contract, and had disposed of it with the aid of his codefendants.\u00a0\u00a0 The defendants alleged that the cocoanuts were not the property of the father of complaining witness; that they were in fact the property of Domingo Desa himself, having been harvested upon a tract of land, the property of Desa's mother; and that there was no obligation upon Desa to deliver the cocoanuts or coprax as alleged by the complaining witness.<br\/><br\/>The evidence of record as to the title to the land on which the cocoanuts were harvested is extremely unsatisfactory and falls far short of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that either the land or the cocoanuts were, as alleged, the property of the father of the complaining witness; and without satisfactory proof upon this point, the other evidence of record does not satisfactorily sustain a finding that the cocoanuts were delivered to the defendant, Domingo Desa, with the obligation to deliver the coprax yielded therefrom to the complaining witness.\u00a0 The evidence submitted by both the complaining witness and the defendants consists of verbal testimony, unsupported by documentary proof; the witnesses for the prosecution testifying that the father of the complaining witness purchased the land from the mother of the accused, Domingo Desa, and the witnesses for the defense denying the fact that such sale had ever been made.\u00a0 It appears that the dispute over the ownership of this land originated as far back as the year 1882; that the various parties continued to contest each other's respective claims down to the year 1894, when it is charged the alleged <i>estafa<\/i> of the coprax made from cocoanuts raised on this land was committed; and that, while the different claimants instituted various administrative proceedings looking to the securing of title to the land in question, no final decision, either judicial or administrative, had been pronounced at the time when these criminal proceedings were instituted.<br\/><br\/>Under all the circumstances, we do not think that a judgment of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt can be affirmed, and we therefore acquit the defendants, Daniel Riota, Domingo Desa, and Valeriano de Luna, of the crime of <i>estafa<\/i> of which they were convicted in the trial court, and reverse the judgment of the trial court in so far as it affects them, and affirm the said judgment in so far as it acquits Jose Riota and Sabas Riota, with the costs of the proceedings <i>de oficio.<\/i><br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Jayne Fosbury, superintendent of schools, the sum of P60 as rent for a house owned by the municipality which the said teacher had occupied during the quarter ending December, 1907.\u00a0 That by reason of his office, it was the duty of the said Pedro Togonon to take charge of the amount received by him as rental from municipal property and to deposit the same, as required by law, at the treasury of the said municipality, but that he willfully, unlawfully and feloniously refused and failed to account for it, and applied said amount to his own use.\u00a0 All contrary to law.<br\/><br\/>The complaint was demurred to on the ground that the facts alleged therein did not constitute a violation of Act No. 1740.\u00a0 The Court of First Instance of Cebu, before whom the complaint was presented, sustained the demurrer on the 24th of March, 1908; thereupon the fiscal appealed to this court.\u00a0 The appeal having been heard it appears:<br\/><br\/>That the trial court sustained the demurrer and ordered the complaint dismissed for the following reasons:\u00a0 That Act No. 1740 punishes persons who misappropriate funds that are in their hands by reason of their office; but that the court was not aware of any law by which it may be considered that the money received by the accused president, in the manner in which it was received, passed into his hands by reason of his office.\u00a0 That in a demurrer, nothing but the facts contained in the complaint are admitted, and that the allegation made therein that the said funds which passed into the possession of the accused under the circumstances set forth, were in his hands by reason of his office, is not a fact stated in the complaint, but the expression of an opinion of the fiscal, a thing which is not admitted by the demurrer in question. That the facts set forth in the complaint may serve as the basis for the presentation of a complaint under the Penal Code in force, but it is not for the court to determine which of its provisions are applicable to the case.\u00a0 For this reason the fiscal was ordered to file a complaint in accordance with the law and the facts set forth.<br\/><br\/>In this instance the fiscal alleges that the complaint presented is in accordance with the law and the facts set forth, and cites section 1 6i Act No. 1740 which reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"Any bonded officer or employee of the Insular Government, or of any provincial or municipal government, or of the city of Manila, and any other person who, having charge, by reason of his office or employment, of Insular, provincial or municipal funds or property, or of funds or property of the city of Manila, or of trust or other funds by law required to be kept or deposited by or with such officer, employee, or other person, or by or with any public office, treasury, or other depositary, fails or refuses to account for the same, or makes personal use of such funds or property, or of any part thereof, or abstracts or misappropriates the same, or any part thereof, or is guilty of any malversation with reference to such funds or property, or through his abandonment, fault, or negligence permits any other person to abstract, misappropriate, or make personal use of the same, shall, upon conviction, be punished by imprisonment for not less than two months nor more than ten years and, in the discretion of the court, by a fine of not more than the amount of such funds and the value of such property,\"<br\/><\/blockquote>and the question is, he says, whether the words \"any other person who, having charge, by reason of his office or employment, of municipal funds, or of other funds by law required to be kept or deposited by or with such officer, employee, or other person who refuses or fails to account for the same, or makes personal use of such funds or property,\" may be applied to a municipal president who, as such president, receives the rentals of property owned by the municipality and fails or refuses to account for, or makes personal use, of the said funds.\u00a0 And his opinion is that they may be so applied.<br\/><br\/>There is no question but that they are applicable in the same manner and for the same reason that the provisions of articles 390, 391, and 392 of the Penal Code, which the said Act of the Philippine Commission has amended and repealed, would apply.\u00a0 The purpose of the Act was the formal repeal of article 392 as to the distinctions and subdistinctions stated in said article, and maintains the leading idea of the crime, distinguishing it from that of <i>estafa<\/i> committed by a private person.\u00a0 It being charged in the complaint that the accused, by reason of his office as municipal president, received money that belonged to and was owing the municipality, it is properly alleged that he received and kept it in his possession by reason of his office.\u00a0 And if, as averred in the complaint, he made personal use of such money without accounting for or delivering it as provided by law, it follows that the unlawful personal use made of the money so received comes within the meaning of, and the penalty imposed for, the crime of malversation defined in section 1 of Act No. 1740, the same as in articles 390, 391, and 392 of the Penal Code.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, the order of the court below sustaining the demurrer is hereby reversed, the dismissal of the complaint is set aside, and the trial shall proceed in accordance with the law.\u00a0 No special ruling is made as to costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson, Willard<\/i>, and <i>Tracey, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><\/div>",

that the said copartnership of Ballester y Puiggros was reorganized under the firm name of Ballester y Albaladejo, and the said credit was transferred thereto as shown by an instrument executed in Legaspi, on the 8th of April, 1905, in the presence of a notary, and by other documents connected therewith; that by means of a public instrument executed and ratified on the 4th of August, 1905, before a notary public of this capital city and other documents connected therewith, the copartnership Ballester y Albaladejo transferred the said credit, among others, to the Compa\u00f1ia General de Tabacos, for which reason the latter is at the present time the lawful owner of the said credit and of its security; and that, as the defendants have not paid in full the amount of the same, the plaintiff prayed that the defendants be sentenced to pay the sum of Pl,658.93, and interest thereon at the rate of 10 per cent per annum to be charged in account at the end of each month from the 1st of August, 1906, and costs.<br\/><br\/>Upon the defendant being duly summoned, Candida Obed answered in writing to the foregoing complaint on the 28th of August, 1906, and set forth:\u00a0 that she admitted the facts as alleged in the first paragraph of the complaint, as well as paragraphs 5 and 6 thereof, only in so far as it concerned the transfer of the credits of the copartnership Ballester y Puiggros to Ballester y Albaladejo, and by the latter to the plaintiff company, and denied all and each one of the allegations in said complaint not expressly admitted in her answer.\u00a0 As a counterclaim, she alleged that the liquidation of accounts of January 31, 1904, referred to in paragraph 2 of the complaint, took place between Ballester y Puiggros and the defendant Felipe Gallegos, and was the result of transactions carried out solely and exclusively by the said Felipe Gallegos without the least intervention on the part of the defendant Candida Obed; that in consequence of the said liquidation of accounts, Candida Obed and her son, the other defendant, had executed and signed a document whereby they jointly and severally acknowledged that they were indebted to the copartnership Ballester y Puiggros in the sum of 2,359.91 pesos, engaging to settle the same by monthly installments of 200 pesos until the debt should be paid in full; that the signature of Candida Obed was obtained by Felipe Gallegos by means of fraud and deceit, he causing her to believe that the said amount was a former debt due by her late husband to Ballester y Puiggros, which substantial error induced the defendant Obed to sign the said document; that the late Tomas Gallegos did not owe any amount whatever to the firm of Ballester y Puiggros, nor to any of their successors; therefore, the cause of the supposed obligation executed by the defendant Obed is a false one, and for said reason she prayed the court to absolve her of the complaint and to declare that the said document was null and void in so far as it referred to the defendant, and to absolve her from the payment of the costs.<br\/><br\/>On the 4th of September, counsel for the plaintiff company answered the foregoing counterclaim in writing and denied each and all of the paragraphs of the same, praying the court below to enter judgment as requested in his complaint.<br\/><br\/>On the 4th of September, 1906, an order was issued by the court declaring the other defendant, Felipe Gallegos, to be in default by reason of his nonappearance in the case.<br\/><br\/>At the trial evidence was adduced by both parties to the suit, and the documents produced by them were made of record; in view thereof the court below rendered judgment on the 24th of September, 1906, sentencing the defendants to pay jointly and severally the sum of P1,658.93 with interest thereon at the rate of 10 per cent per annum to be charged in account at the end\u00a0 of each month beginning on the 1st of August, 1906, until the full payment of the debt, and costs.\u00a0 The representative of the defendant excepted to the foregoing judgment and moved for a new trial on the ground that the conclusions therein contained were openly and manifestly contrary to the weight and the result of the evidence, and because said judgment was contrary to law; the motion was overruled, to which the petitioner excepted and presented the corresponding bill of exceptions, and, notwithstanding the objections of the plaintiff, the same was approved by the lower court and forwarded to the clerk of this court.<br\/><br\/>The matter in controversy is the collection of a certain sum of money resulting from a liquidation of accounts, and set forth as a debt in a private document which was acknowledged as authentic by the debtors who signed it.<br\/><br\/>Under article 1091 of the Civil Code, obligations arising from contracts have legal force between the contracting parties, and must be fulfilled in accordance with their stipulations; and according to the decisions of the supreme court of Spain when applying the provisions of the said article, among which are those of February 20, 1897, and February 13, 1904, the stipulations of a contract are binding on the parties thereto.<br\/><br\/>Candida Obed, widow of the late Tomas Gallegos, and her son, Felipe Gallegos, acknowledged that they were indebted to the firm of Ballester y Puiggros in the sum of 2,359.91 pesos, Mexican currency, as the balance resulting from the liquidation of accounts effected on January 31, 1904, and they engaged to pay at the end of each month, commencing from the following February, the sum of 200 pesos until the whole amount was paid, together with interest at the rate of 10 per cent per annum to be charged on the balance resulting at the expiration of each month.\u00a0 In addition to this they engaged to pay in Philippine currency at par when the same would become legal tender and the Mexican money be prohibited or depreciated.\u00a0 All this, including other particulars, appears in document Exhibit A signed by the debtors, who, in their sworn testimony, acknowledged the signatures appearing at the foot thereof as being theirs.<br\/><br\/>Candida Obed was the only defendant who appeared at the trial and appealed from the judgment; the other defendant, Felipe Gallegos, was held to be in default; she alleged, as the basis of her\u00a0 petition to be absolved from the complaint and that the said document be declared null and void in so far as she was concerned, that her signature had been obtained by her son, the said Felipe, by means of fraud and deceit, he having caused her to believe that the debt shown in said document marked \"A\" was a debt contracted by her late husband, Tomas Gallegos, and that the cause of said\u00a0 obligation was a false one, because her deceased husband, in life, was not indebted to the said copartnership.<br\/><br\/>In order to assert that Candida Obed was deceived by her son Felipe when signing the document marked \"A,\" it is indispensable to prove that fraud and deceit were practiced on her, and that she signed the document without being acquainted with its contents; this does not appear from the record, but on the contrary, according to her son, the said Felipe, the contents of the document were interpreted to her\u00a0 in the Bicol dialect before the defendant affixed her signature to it.\u00a0 Besides, that Candida Obed\u00a0 knows and understands Spanish was attested by the witness Pedro Albaladejo, and was also so considered by the trial judge in his judgment; therefore, the first error assigned can not be sustained.<br\/><br\/>If before Candida Obed signed the document marked \"A.\" she and her codebtor Felipe had already requested by letter from the creditors an extension of the term agreed upon, or promised to effect payment of the debt in question, after the document was executed and signed they again requested in like manner a further extension by reason of lack of means; hence, though it was not proven at the trial that the debtor Obed had signed the said document unknowingly, induced by means of deceit by her aforesaid son and codebtor, the letters which, jointly with the latter, she addressed to the creditors, and the later payments made on account of the indebtedness are equally spontaneous acts which confirm the truth and legitimacy of the obligation contracted by her together with the other defendant.<br\/><br\/>The record shows that Tomas Gallegos, while in life, received from Ballester y Puiggros the sum of 1,000 pesos on account and by order of his son Felipe.\u00a0 The latter avers that the said sum was not refunded to him by his father, and that he now owes it to the Compa\u00f1ia General de Tabacos which has acquired the rights of the original creditors, and that the same formed part of the debit balance of his account.<br\/><br\/>Even though.the right to recover the 1,000 pesos from Tomas Gallegos, and now from his estate, pertains to the other defendant, Felipe Gallegos, on whose account and order said sum was paid by Ballester y Puiggros, yet since Candida Obed and her said son Felipe have engaged and bound themselves to pay it to the said copartnership as having been received by the deceased husband\u00a0 and father of the obligated parties, in the absence of proof that he had paid his debt while in life, it is strictly just that they be compelled to pay jointly or by halves such amount as they may still owe, together with the interest agreed upon.<br\/><br\/>To effect the annulment of the obligation contracted by means of document marked \"A\" it would be necessary to prove that a false reason for the debt was expressed therein.\u00a0 If it is true that the sum of 1,000 pesos, which Tomas Gallegos received from Ballester y Puiggros, while in life, is still unpaid, the obligation contained in the said document is valid and efficient, because it acknowledges a real cause, and the defendant is liable for one-half of the indebtedness; consequently the provisions of article 1276 of the Civil Code, which serve as a basis for the second and fourth errors assigned in the brief of the appellant are not applicable herein.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the third error, and in spite of the answer and counterclaim\u00a0 presented by the defendant Obed, the obligation contains absolutely nothing to prove that the debtors had contracted an obligation <i>in solidum<\/i>; for said reason the appellant can only be sentenced to pay one-half of the amount claimed, in accordance with the provisions of articles 1137 and 1138 of the Civil Code.<br\/><br\/>In order that an obligation may be considered as <i>in solidum<\/i> it is necessary that it be so expressed, in the contract, because as a general rule, in the absence of such positive stipulation, it is presumably mancomunal, and the debt is presumed to be divided equally among those obligated.<br\/><br\/>The fact that it was stated in the document above alluded to that mother and son had acknowledged the document marked \"A\" to mean that they owed jointly and severally the amount therein contained, does not prevent the establishment of the true character of the agreement, to-wit, that the obligation is <i>mancomunal<\/i>, but <i>not in solidum<\/i>.\u00a0 The conclusions in a judgment must be established not in accordance with the briefs of the parties, but according to the evidence adduced, and it should be noted that document marked \"A.\" the enforcement of which is sought, does not state that the obligation is <i>in solidum<\/i>.\u00a0 (Sec. 109, Code of Civil Procedure.)<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing considerations, it is our opinion that the judgment appealed from should be affirmed, as we do hereby affirm it:\u00a0 <i>Provided, however<\/i>, That the defendants Felipe Gallegos, and Manuel Gallegos, the judicial administrator of the intestate estate of the late Candida Obed, shall be sentenced jointly, or to\u00a0 pay by halves the amount stated in said judgment, with interest thereon at the rate of 10 per cent [per annum] from the 1st of August, 1906, with the costs of the first instance also by halves, and the said administrator to pay all the costs of this\u00a0 second instance.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

A goldsmith calling on Andrea Arao to obtain a piece of gold that he was in need of for that afternoon, she took out of her wardrobe a box containing her jewels in order to search for it, and took the jewels out of the said box; among these were the earrings, in a green case with a damaged lid or cover, and the mother and her daughter Deuda, upon seeing the earrings, asked the owner what was the value of the same.  By this time, Andrea had found the gold that she was looking for and, leaving her jewels on the washstand, she went outside to give the gold to the goldsmith who was waiting for it.  After that she went to the kitchen, and presently returned to her room, where she collected her jewels and again plated them in the box which she put in her wardrobe; she did not observe the absence of the pair of earrings until Sunday, the 24th, when she missed them from the case in the jewel box.<br\/><br\/>From the investigations made it appears that Saturnina Lambergue, who was also in said house on the 12th of May, while at work milling <i>jocoy<\/i>, observed that during the absence of Andrea Arao from her room, Valeriana Deuda, who together with her mother had remained in said room, picked up a green jewel case and after removing its contents replaced it inside the box, and that in the same evening both the mother and daughter left the house after taking leave of the injured party, who was still unaware of the loss of the earrings.<br\/><br\/>It was afterwards found that in the afternoon of the 21st the said two women called on the  goldsmith Marcelino Rodriguez, who resided in Casiguran, and requested him to repair the setting of one of the earrings which was only tied with a string, but the goldsmith, upon examining said earrings and seeing the defect, declined to do the work for fear of breaking the stones; on the 23d of said month of May, the aforesaid mother and daughter went to the house of Eugenia PongO who also lived in Casiguran and pawned the earrings for P15, but later on they sold them to her for P80, and she therefore kept the jewels and paid them the difference of P65.  When Eugenia Pongo was summoned to testify in the investigation of the loss of the earrings, she carried them with her in a case of the same green color, inside a basket.  Before appearing in the court of the justice of the peace, she lodged in the house of the injured party, the said Andrea Arao; but when dressing herself or changing her clothes, she missed the case containing the earrings from the basket  that she had laid near the wardrobe of the injured party, so that  she appeared in court without the earrings; on the following day, however, she found the case with the jewels underneath the said wardrobe.<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing the provincial fiscal filed a complaint on the 7th of August, 1908, with the Court of First Instance of Sorsogon, charging Valeriana Deuda and Basilia Decano with the crime of theft; after the proceedings were instituted the trial judge, on the 24th of October of the same year, sentenced Basilia Decano to the penalty of one year eight months and twenty-one days of <i>presidio correccional<\/i>, and Valeriana Deuda, being under age, to the penalty of four months and twenty-one days of <i>arresto mayor<\/i>; the pair of earrings were ordered returned to Andrea Arao, and the two accused were jointly and severally sentenced to pay the sum of P80 to Eugenia Pongo with the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and each of them to pay one-half of the costs; the court further ordered that Valeriana Deuda be detained in the Hospicio de San Jose in Manila for a period of one year, and that execution of the sentence imposed in this cause be suspended by virtue of the provisions of section 1 of Act No. 1438.   From the foregoing judgment the accused have appealed.  The above-stated facts have been fully proven in the present case, and it is inferred therefrom that the crime of theft of a pair of gold earrings, set with diamonds, has been committed, and that the said earrings were stolen from the possession and house of Andrea Arao Nepomuceno, in the town of Sorsogon, Sorsogon, and were contained in a green case that was placed upon the washstand inside the room; that the theft was committed without the employment of force or violence; that the jewels were valued at P600 and were owned by Petronia Azopardo and were kept by Andrea Arao as a pledge to guarantee a debt of P345.  The crime is defined and punished by paragraph 1 of article 517, and paragraph 2 of article 518 of the Penal Code.<br\/><br\/>The case contains conclusive evidence that Valeriana Deuda, a girl under 18 and above 15 years of age, was the person who stole the said pair of earrings from the case at a time when she was in the bedroom of Andrea Arao and the latter was outside of it; despite her denial and exculpatory allegations, the due consideration of the evidence and other data offered by the prosecution produce in the mind absolute conviction of the guilt of the accused as the sole principal of the crime herein prosecuted.<br\/><br\/>Effectively, shortly before committing the crime, the accused and her mother, who was also in the said room, upon seeing the jewel, inquired of Andrea Arao the value thereof; Saturnina Lambergue, who was then working in the <i>sala<\/i> or hall of the house, saw the accused, Valeriana, in the act of opening a green case and saw her remove its contents and put the case back into the jewel box which the owner of the house had left on the washstand when she went outside to deliver a piece of gold to the waiting goldsmith; the accused Deuda took advantage of the opportunity to possess herself of said earrings.  The goldsmith, Marcelino Rodriguez, a resident of Casiguran, in said province, stated in turn that in the afternoon of May 21, after the theft was committed, Valeriana Deuda and  her mother, Basilia Decano, called at his house and showed him a pair of earrings; they desired him to repair one that was only tied with a string; this he refused to do for fear of breaking some of the diamonds which he considered were of great value.  Said witness at the trial recognized the pair of earrings as being the same that the accused had shown him on that occasion.<br\/><br\/>Eugenia Pongo testified that on the 21st or 23d of May the accused called at her house and pawned said earrings for P15, and that later on they returned and sold them to her for P80, and that, as she had previously paid them P15, she only gave them the difference, to wit, P65; said witness also recognized the earrings exhibited at the trial as being the same that she had bought from the accused; and that, when she was summoned before the justice of the peace to testify regarding the crime in question, she carried them in a green case, which she also recognized at the trial; that, while she was staying at the house of Andrea Arao, she missed the earrings and the case when she was taking her clothes out of the basket or <i>tampipi<\/i> which she carried, and which was placed near a wardrobe, but that, on the following day, they were found underneath the said wardrobe, and that in this manner the earrings were recovered by the said Andrea Arao Nepomuceno.<br\/><br\/>All of the above data offered by the prosecution-the absolute absence of proof contained in the vague statements made by the two accused, as well as the lack of explanation on the part of Valeriana  Deuda as to how she came to be in possession of said pair of earrings-constitute satisfactory and conclusive evidence of her culpability as the sole convicted principal of the theft.<br\/><br\/>In the commission of the crime herein the presence of circumstance No. 10 of article 10 of the Penal Code must be considered, because there is no question that Valeriana, while staying together with her mother in the house of the injured party, took advantage of the occasion when Andrea Arao left her room, and for the moment had abandoned her box of jewels; she abused the confidence which in some manner the owner of the house had shown them both by receiving them and freely lodging them in her own bedroom; this circumstance does not appear counteracted in its effects by any generic mitigating circumstance, beyond the special privileged circumstanced of article  9 of the code, for the reason that she is under 18 years of age; therefore, the said Valeriana Deuda has incurred the maximum degree of the penalty immediately inferior to that imposed by paragraph 2 of article 518, by virtue of the provisions of paragraph 2 of article 85, that is to say, <i>arresto mayor<\/i> in its medium and maximum degrees, imposed for the maximum period as appears in the judgment appealed from.<br\/><br\/>It does not appear from the proceedings that Basilia Decano had taken any part, in stealing the said earrings, inasmuch as the only eyewitness of the crime, Saturnina Lambergue, only points out Valeriana Deuda as being the person who took the green case from the box, and after opening it took the jewel therein contained, and at once returned the case to the box; Basilia Decano was not then present; it appears that she was at the window of the room, a certain distance away from the washstand on which the owner of the house had left the\"jewel box, nor does it appear that the mother had induced her daughter to commit the crime or that she acted in accord  with the latter in the commission thereof.  But it can not be denied that the mother saw the earrings in the possession of her daughter, and the latter had no right to possess them, and, instead of investigating how they came into her possession, or returning the jewels to their owner, together with her daughter she took steps to obtain gain and profit from their  value, since she went with her daughter to have them repaired by the goldsmith Rodriguez, and also pawned and finally sold them to Eugenia Pongo.  Such behavior clearly indicates that she was an accessory after the fact.<br\/><br\/>Paragraph 1 of article  15  of  the Penal Code reads:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"Accessories are those who, having knowledge of the commission of the crime, and without having participated therein either as principals or accomplices, subsequently take part in its execution in any of the following manners :<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"1.  By themselves making profit or by assisting the delinquents to profit by the  effects of the crime.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><\/blockquote><br\/>Article 16 of the same code also prescribes:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"Those who are accessories of their spouses, ascendants, descendants, legitimate, natural, or adopted brothers or sisters, or relatives by affinity in the same degrees, are exempt from the penalties imposed upon accessories, with the only exception of such accessories who may be included in No. 1 of  the preceding article.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>Therefore, notwithstanding the fact that Basilia Decano is the mother of the principal accused, her relationship does not exejnpt her from liability as the accessory of her daughter, for the reason that she assisted her in obtaining profit from the theft and herself obtained profit therefrom, and since no mitigating nor aggravating  circumstance is present with relation to the former, the penalty prescribed by article 68 must be imposed in the medium degree.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing considerations it is our opinion that the judgment appealed from should be affirmed, as we do hereby affirm it with respect to Valeriana Deuda, and reversed as regards the accessory Basilia Decano, upon whom we impose a fine of 2,000 pesetas and, in case of insolvency, to suffer subsidiary imprisonment, which shall not exceed one month and one day according to the provisions of article 92 of the code, and both accused shall pay, share and share alike, the costs of this instance; it is further ordered that the earrings be returned to Andrea Arao if the same have not yet been delivered to her.  So ordered.<br\/><br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C J., Mapa, Johnson, Carson<\/i>, and<i> Moreland, JJ<\/i>, concur.<\/div>",

Alejo Alegria, Alejandro Olmo, Valentin Puerta and Andres Mondragon on shares; it is bounded on the north by a mountain, on the south by the sea, on the east by the sea and the Andoon River and on the west by the Gigalaman River .and a mountain;\" then follows a statement of other personal property that forms a part of the said hacienda.<br\/><br\/>The sale at public auction of the sugar-producing hacienda known as \"San Jose,\" was advertised for the 22d of August, 1906, the same being then described with more detail with regard to its boundaries, but no mention whatever was made of the fact that it was planted with sugar cane as was stated in the attachment proceedings.<br\/><br\/>On the 12th of September, 1906, the auction sale of the hacienda took place, the property being adjudicated, as was announced at the sale, to Don Manuel Couto on behalf of the Compa\u00f1ia General de Tabacos de Filipinas, for the sum of P64,826.92.\u00a0 The sheriff informed Couto that the defendant, her heirs or assigns, were entitled to redeem the property sold within the term of twelve months from date.\u00a0 This fact was stated in the record which was subscribed by Couto, together with the sheriff and four witnesses.<br\/><br\/>And the court below found that on the 7th of May, 1907, the plaintiff prayed the court to confirm the sale of the property to the Compa\u00f1ia General de Tabacos, and this is confirmed by the appellant in his brief.<br\/><br\/>But on the following day, that is, on the 8th of the said month of May, 1907, the plaintiff filed a motion alleging among other facts the third, to wit, that the sheriff, by mistake and without any desire to contravene the order of the lower court, when selling the said property at public auction, failed to include the sugar cane in the record of the sale; the fourth, which reads:\u00a0 Manuel Couto on behalf of the Tabacalera was the highest bidder at the auction sale of the Hacienda San Jose with all of the improvements thereon, consequently including the sugar cane that existed on said hacienda, and offered more than 60,000 pesos for the purchase of the property of Do\u00f1a Romana Ganson; the fifth in which he states:\u00a0 that the plaintiff never intended to offer said amount if the sugar cane on the Hacienda San Jose was not to be considered as sold with it, as improvements attached thereto, and for this reason he prayed:\u00a0 (1) That the court below sustain its order of the 20th of July, 1906; (2) that it be held that the sugar cane was included in the auction sale of the 12th of September, 1906; and (8) that in case this petition is denied, the auction sale be not confirmed, and that a new sale be ordered.\u00a0 By its decision of the 3d of September, 1907, the court below held that the cane levied upon was not included in the auction sale of the Hacienda of San Jose held on the 12th of September, 1906, and dismissed the petition asking for the nullification of said sale, or rather, it confirmed the latter, declaring that the sale made to the plaintiff was valid and final; reserving to the plaintiff the right to bring such action as he saw fit against the provincial sheriff or his deputy for having failed to include in the sale the rights of Do\u00f1a Romana Ganson to the cane on the realty sold.\u00a0 The court based its conclusions on the following statement of facts and of law:<br\/><br\/>That the property sold is specified in detail as may be seen from the record of the auction sale which was subscribed by the purchaser.<br\/><br\/>That it does not appear therein that the cane existing at the time on the property sold was included in the sale.<br\/><br\/>Nor was the said cane included in the notice of the, sale.\u00a0 And according to the foregoing proofs it is evident that the cane was not sold at the auction sale.<br\/><br\/>It is incredible that the purchaser was induced to commit error when he purchased the property, because, as appears from the evidence, he read the record of the sale before signing it and the property he purchase was set out in such detail that objects and utensils of trifling value were included, while the cane, though of great value, was omitted; the plaintiff did not protest or offer any remark with respect to the fact that no mention was made of the latter.<br\/><br\/>There is no such irregularity as would invalidate the sale, and no judicial sale should be annulled unless it is proven that some legal defect is present.\u00a0 It has been fully proven that, after the sale of the property at public auction, the receiver, with the concurrence of the plaintiff, charged to the \"Debit\" of the defendant all the expenses incurred in caring for the said cane, a fact which evidently shows that the plaintiff was fully convinced that the said cane had not been included in the sale of the property.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff alleged that the court below committed nine errors:<br\/><br\/>First, for not sustaining the order given by it on the 20th of July, 1906.<br\/><br\/>Second, for holding that the cane situated on the Hacienda of San Jose was not included in the auction sale of the same.<br\/><br\/>Third, for considering that no good grounds exist for the annulment of the auction sale.<br\/><br\/>Fourth, for declaring that the purchaser was not in error when believing in good faith that the hacienda was being sold together with the sugar cane that existed thereon.<br\/><br\/>Fifth, for declaring that the purchaser was aware that the cane had been excluded from the auction sale, as shown by the fact that by another posterior action he requested the temporary attachment of the same.<br\/><br\/>Sixth, for basing its opinion on the fact that the purchaser asked for the judicial confirmation of the sale.<br\/><br\/>Seventh, for not having annulled the sale, and for confirming it, notwithstanding the consequent injustice and loss to which the purchaser is subjected.<br\/><br\/>Eighth, for declaring that it finds no irregularity impairing the sale.<br\/><br\/>Ninth, for not annulling the sale and ordering a new one, and for holding it valid, as well as confirming it without a petition from the parties.<br\/><br\/>The court below has not committed the first error assigned because it was not necessary to sustain its order for the sale when the same had already been effected and the mortgaged property, which was that stated in the order, was all sold; the cane which it is pretended was included in the word <i>mortgaged<\/i> was not set out therein.<br\/><br\/>Neither did it commit the second error assigned because it is one question whether the cane, as fruit, is or should be considered a part of the soil that produces or has produced the same, and another question whether as a matter of fact it had been advertised for sale and included in the sale that was carried out. As a matter of fact it was not included in the advertisement of the sale, nor in the sale itself; the subject-matter of the contract of purchase and sale is expressed in the record subscribed to that effect by the vendor, the purchaser, and the witnesses to the act, and this proof is conclusive.<br\/><br\/>And the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth errors assigned need not be taken into consideration for the reasons given in the judgment, and the result of the evidence.<br\/><br\/>In the attachment proceedings it was clearly stated, without protest to the contrary, that the sugar cane had mostly been planted by the lessees hereinbefore named.<br\/><br\/>The trial court found that the only thing for which the sheriff who executed the sale deserved to be censured, was for not having included in the sale the proportional right that the defendant had to the cane, of the lessees, and hence the reservation of the right of action against the sheriff which constitutes one of the findings in the judgment.<br\/><br\/>It is quite true that the cane was not included in the sale, because it should not be sold, belonging, as it did, to the lessees.\u00a0 The only thing that should have been included was the right of the defendant to such proportion as might be due to her by reason of the said lease on shares.<br\/><br\/>There could be no error on the part of the purchaser, inasmuch as by the purchase of the hacienda he did not become the owner of the cane.\u00a0 Had he considered himself to be the owner of the same, he would have attended to the expenses in connection therewith from the 13th of September, 1906, the day after the sale, until the 25th of November, when the receiver rendered his accounts, instead of charging said expenses to the defendant, as owner of the crops under cultivation on the hacienda.<br\/><br\/>There is not the least evidence of such an error of fact on the part of the plaintiff.\u00a0 And it is not necessary to decide at the present time whether, in the sale of realty, the fruits existing thereon should be included therein, no protest having been made against the attachment proceedings wherein appear the rights of third persons who are not contending in this suit, and with respect to whom the decision of the question in one sense or the other, can produce no effect; the decision should refer exclusively to the fruits produced by the industry of the person who alienates the property.\u00a0 In this case the planting was done by a third person with the consent of the owner of the realty by virtue of a contract of lease on shares between the said parties. The only thing that could be considered to have been sold with the realty is that which, as the result of said contract, appertained to the owner of the land.\u00a0 Certainly the right which the purchaser believed he had can not prevail against a third person who took no part in the sale; <i>res inter alios acta, aliis non nocet<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>If there was no foundation for such a belief of fact and of law, nor for considering that an error was committed in any way, then the case does not come within the provisions of section 257 of the Code of Civil Procedure in order that the lower court may refuse, for good cause shown, to confirm the sale effected, nor is it within the power of the court to set aside a contract which was not only perfected, but consummated, unless it be by reason of error duly proven, as provided by the Civil Code.<br\/><br\/>On the 11th of February, 1907, which is the date of the letter addressed by the plaintiff's attorney to the sheriff (Exhibit T, 5 of the defendant), application had already been made for the temporary attachment of the said cane.\u00a0 Although the said temporary attachment was merely asked for <i>ad cautelam<\/i>, the letter read:<br\/><blockquote>\"Present also to the registrar a copy of Bates' order together with a description of the cane and the notification of its attachment, causing a statement to be entered in said register that this cane, as maintained by the plaintiff, belongs to the defendant and appears in the name of Azcona, and is under the control of the receiver Pomar.\" <\/blockquote> It is not inferred from this letter, as the appellee desires, the explicit confession that it attributes to the appellant that the cane is the property of the defendant in opposition to that claimed by the plaintiff, but he probably suggested this form of registration so as to reject the pretended ownership of the lessees.\u00a0 But be that as it may, it is quite evident that, five months after the plaintiff had acquired the hacienda, at auction, he himself caused the cane existing thereon to be entered in the registry of property as the property of the defendant; and in this state of affairs, after it appeared that the cane had been excluded from the purchase of the hacienda by an act of the purchaser himself, the latter asked, by his writing of the 7th of May 1907, that the sale of the hacienda be confirmed.\u00a0 It may be seen, therefore, that it is impossible to maintain that said confirmation was asked for on the understanding that the cane was included, or should be included in the purchase of the hacienda.<br\/><br\/>After asking that the purchase or sale by public auction held on the 7th of May, 1907, be confirmed, and upon requesting on the following day, the 8th, that the same be declared null, the court below was placed under the necessity of rendering a decision, and it did so in the terms contained in the judgment appealed from, precisely as requested by the appellant. It can not, therefore, be conceived how there can be said to be error \"in not having annulled the auction sale, and in having confirmed it declaring it valid without the request of the parties,\" as alleged in the last assignment of error, when the petition did not contain a single, request, but a double one.<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing we hold that the judgment appealed from should be and it is hereby affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa<\/i>, and <i>Carson, JJ<\/i>., concur. <i>Johnson, J<\/i>., did not sit in this case.<br\/><\/div>",

The first and most important question raised upon the appeal relates to the powers of the judge to deal with the report of the commissioners when it is presented to him.\u00a0 Section 246 of the Code of Civil Procedure is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Upon the filing of such report in court, the court shall, upon hearing, accept the same and render judgment in accordance therewith; or for cause shown, it may recommit the report to the commissioners for further report of facts; or it may set aside the report and appoint new commissioners; or it may accept the report in part and reject it in part, and may make such final order and judgment as shall secure to the plaintiff the property essential to the exercise of his rights under the law, and to the defendant just compensation for the land so taken; and the judgment shall require payment of the sum awarded as provided in the next section, before the plaintiff can enter upon the ground and appropriate it to the public use.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Whether in any case the court upon the hearing of the report can receive additional evidence as to the value of the property and then change the amount awarded by the commissioners, is a question which we are not called upon here to decide, for the court below received no additional evidence.\u00a0 (See, however, the case of The City of Manila <i>vs<\/i>. Tuason,<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> No. 3367, decided March 23,1907.)<br\/><br\/>Nor do we decide whether, in a case where the damages awarded by the commissioners are grossly excessive or grossly insufficient, the court can, upon the same evidence presented before the commissioners, itself change the award.\u00a0 We restrict ourselves to deciding the precise question presented by this case, in which it is apparent that, in the opinion of the court below, the damages were not grossly excessive, for its own allowance was only P1,000 less than the amount allowed by the commissioners, and the question is, whether in such a case the court can substitute its own opinion upon the evidence presented before the commissioners for the opinion which the commissioners themselves formed, not only from that evidence but also from a view of the premises which by law they were required to make.<br\/><br\/>That the award of the commissioners was not palpably insufficient or excessive appears moreover from the evidence presented before them.\u00a0 Immediately upon taking possession of the property the railway company took down the house, removed the materials to a place nearer the center of the city, and there reconstructed it, but not in the same form in which it was before.\u00a0 The commissioners fixed the value of the house at P9,500, and the court at P8,792.50.\u00a0 The witness Chu Po-Co, testifying for the owner, said that the value of the house was a little over P12,000.\u00a0\u00a0 Another witness for the owner, Rafael de Ocampo, testified that the value of the house was more than P12,000.\u00a0 A third witness, Navarro, testified that it would cost to construct the house P14,126.82.\u00a0 For the company, Pedro Rojo testified that to build the house in the condition in which it was at the time of the hearing would cost P8,750.\u00a0 By Quangko testified that he would construct it as it then was for P6,250.\u00a0 Austin, an employee of the company, testified that it would cost to construct it as it then was P7,050.95.<br\/><br\/>The court below, in arriving at its valuation, took as the basis therefor a claim made by the owner as to what it cost him to construct it.\u00a0 It may be said that it nowhere appears in the record before us that the owner presented a claim to the effect that the house cost him P9,938, as stated by the court below.\u00a0 He testified at the trial that it cost him more than P10,000.\u00a0 The court then considered the evidence relating to the cost of the various articles which had gone into the construction of the house and found that the cost of some of these articles was less than the amount claimed by the owner.\u00a0 For example, the court said that the owner claimed to have spent P320 for shingles, and the court was of the opinion that he only spent P256; that the owner claimed for the windows and doors P750, when in the opinion of the court he had spent P500 for them,\u00a0 The owner had preserved none of the bills which he had paid for the material purchased with one or two exceptions, and his testimony as to what the materials cost him and as to the amount of the materials was not precise.<br\/><br\/>Without considering the correctness of the rule adopted by the court for determining the value of the property, it is sufficient to say that the evidence before the commissioners, as to the value of the property taken was contradictory and that their award was not palpably excessive or inadequate.\u00a0 Under such circumstances, we are of the opinion\u00a0 that the court had no right to interfere with it.\u00a0 The law provides, section 243 of the Code of Civil Procedure, that the commissioners shall be judicious and disinterested landowners of the province.\u00a0 It provides, section 244, that evidence may be introduced before them, and that they shall, unless the parties consent to the contrary, go to the premises together and view the property sought to be condemned and its surroundings, and may examine and measure the same.\u00a0 It must have been intended that some effect should be given to their award after such a hearing and examination as is provided for by the statute.\u00a0 The view taken by the court below would practically reduce their powers to the mere mechanical work of taking down the\u00a0 evidence presented before them, for the\" judgment appealed from must have proceeded upon the basis that the court has the right in\u00a0 every case to disregard the award and form its own opinion upon the evidence presented before the commissioners.\u00a0 In other words, that it tries the case in the same way that it would try any other case pending before it where the evidence consisted of depositions taken out of court.\u00a0 We can not believe that such was the intention of the legislator.\u00a0 If it had been, commissioners would have been dispensed with and the law would have provided for the trial of these actions in the same way as other actions pending in the Court of First Instance.<br\/><br\/>Moreover, section 246 provides that the court may set aside the report\u00a0 or recommit it, or appoint new commissioners only for cause shown and it can not be considered that a mere difference of opinion between the court and the commissioners as to what the evidence before them showed the true value of the property to be, constitutes such cause.<br\/><br\/>This question has frequently been before the courts of the United States in cases of this character, and the law there is well settled.\u00a0 In the case of Shoemaker <i>vs<\/i>. The United States (147 U. S., 282) the Supreme Court of the United States said at page 305:<br\/><blockquote>\"In connection with this part of the subject, we may appropriately consider the objection made to the action of the court below in declining to review and pass upon the evidence that had been produced before the commissioners.<br\/><br\/>\"If, as we have said, the court below was right in refusing to restrict the commissioners to a mere consideration of the evidence adduced, then it would seem to follow that the court could not be legitimately asked, in the absence of any exceptions based upon charges of fraud, corruption, or plain mistake on the part of the appraisers, to go into a consideration of the evidence.\u00a0 The court can not bring into review before it the various sources and grounds of judgment upon which the appraisers have proceeded.\u00a0 The attempt to do so would transfer the function of finding the values of the lands from the appraisers to the court.\u00a0 Such a course would have presented a much more serious allegation of error than we find in the objection as made.<br\/><br\/>\"The rule on this subject is so well settled that we shall content ourselves with repeating an apt quotation from Mills on Eminent Domain, 246, made in the opinion of the court below:\u00a0 'An appellate court will not interfere with the report of commissioners to correct the amount of damages except in cases of gross error, showing prejudice or corruption.\u00a0 The commissioners hear the evidence and frequently make their principal evidence out of a view of the premises, and this evidence can not be carried up so as to correct the report as being against the weight of evidence.\u00a0 Hence, for an error in\u00a0 the judgment of commissioners in arriving at the amount of damages there can be no correction, especially where the evidence is conflicting.\u00a0 Commissioners are not bound by the opinions of experts or by the apparent weight of evidence, but may give their own conclusions.'\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In Braun <i>vs<\/i>. Metropolitan West Side Elevated R. R. Co. (166 Ill., 434), the court said at page 436:<br\/><blockquote>\"We have carefully considered the evidence relied upon by appellant as showing that this verdict is so inconsistent with the weight of the testimony as that the court below should have set it aside, and this court, for its\u00a0 failure to do so, should reverse the judgment.\u00a0 It has been often decided by this court that in cases of this kind, where the jury have viewed the premises and the evidence is conflicting, we will not interfere with the verdict unless it is so manifestly contrary to the preponderance of the evidence as to indicate misconduct on the part of the jury.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In the City of St. Louis <i>vs<\/i>. Brown (155 Mo., 545), the court said at page 567:<br\/><blockquote>\"As to the value of the land taken there was sufficient and satisfactory evidence to sustain the award of the commissioners.\u00a0 On a mere question of value depending on conflicting evidence the circuit courts should hesitate to interfere with the commissioners' finding, although in a proper case it has undoubtedly the right and duty to do so.\u00a0 A board of commissioners\u00a0 is the tribunal provided by our Constitution to do justice\u00a0 in such cases between the city and the citizen.\u00a0 They are selected by the circuit court and should be men of good judgment and honest repute.\u00a0 They have an advantage that the court and even a jury do not have in trying a case, they go upon the land and make a personal observation and study of it and its surroundings, besides they have the benefit of such evidence as parties see fit to bring before them.\u00a0 Assuming, as we must, until the contrary is shown, that the commissioners have given the subject their best, careful, and conscientious consideration, their finding on a mere question of value is entitled to great weight with the trial judge when he is hearing exceptions to their report.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>We hold that the court below committed error in substituting in this case its own opinion as to the value of the property for the\u00a0 opinion of the commissioners as found in their report, and reducing the award.<br\/><br\/>The appellant, the owner, claims that the damages allowed by the commissioners were insufficient and that the award should be increased.\u00a0 If upon the circumstances of this case the judge below should not have reduced the award, it is apparent that he should not have increased it.\u00a0 Our conclusion is that it was the duty of the court upon the hearing before it to confirm the report.<br\/><br\/>2.\u00a0 The owner claims that he is entitled to interest from the date when the company took possession of his property.\u00a0 The court allowed him interest only from the date of its judgment.\u00a0 On the 2d day of February, 1907, the court, upon the petition of the plaintiff company, issued an order, authorizing the company to take immediate possession of the property.\u00a0 This it did, taking down the house and removing it to another place as has been before stated.\u00a0 The commissioners did not make their report until more than a year afterward, that is to say, on the 27th of April, 1908. The court did not decide the case until the 16th day of June, 1908.<br\/><br\/>Our attention has not been called to any Act of the Commission relating to the matter of interest.\u00a0 But that the owner is entitled to interest from the time when the company took possession of the property on the second day of February, 1907, until the decision of the court on the 16th day of June, 1908, we think is clear.\u00a0 The statute requires just compensation to be made to the owner for his property taken, and section 246 above cited requires the court to make such final order and judgment as shall secure to the plaintiff the property essential to the exercise of his rights under the law and to the defendant just compensation for the land so taken.\u00a0 The defendant, the owner, was deprived of the use of his property from the 2d day of February, 1907, until the 19th day of July, 1908.\u00a0 He lost the use of it for this time, and it can not be said that he has received just compensation for it if he is not allowed interest upon the value of the property\u00a0 during that time.\u00a0 In the case of The Pennsylvania Railroad Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Cooper (58 Penn. St., 408), the court said at page 409:<br\/><blockquote>\"It can hardly be made a question that the plaintiff below was entitled to recover interest upon the value of his property taken by the company defendants and appropriated for the purposes of their road from the time that it was taken.\u00a0 He is in the position of a vendor of land, who has always been held to have a right to interest on the purchase-money where possession has been delivered to the vendee.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In the case of Warren <i>vs<\/i>. First Division of the St. Paul &amp; Pacific Railroad Co. (21 Minn., 424), the court said at page 427:<br\/><blockquote>\"If, therefore, the allowance of interest upon the amount of the assessment shall be necessary to make the compensation just, we have no doubt of authority in the court to make it; and we think that, generally, it is necessary to allow interest from the date of the award to give to the owner just compensation.\u00a0 While the assessed value, if paid at the date taken for the assessment, might be just compensation, it certainly would not be, if payment be delayed, as might happen in many cases, and as did happen in this case, till several years after that time.\u00a0 The difference is the same as between a sale for cash in hand and a sale on time.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In the case of Philipps <i>vs<\/i>. The South Park Commissioners (119 111., 626), the court said at page 645:<br\/><blockquote>\"The court allowed interest on the amount decreed Mrs. Philipps, from the 27th day of August, 1870, the time when the commissioners took possession of the land, and this is relied upon as error.\u00a0 Lands can not be taken and appropriated to public use without just compensation is made to the owner; and we think our law of eminent domain requires the payment of the compensation, or a tender, or deposit of the same with the county treasurer, before possession of the land shall be taken.\u00a0 This seems manifest from section 10 of the Eminent Domain Act, which, in substance, provides that, when the report of the jury is brought in, the court or judge shall make such order as to right and justice shall pertain, ordering that petitioner enter upon such property, and the use of the same, upon payment of full compensation, as ascertained as aforesaid.\u00a0 The payment of the compensation, or the deposit of the same, seems to be a condition precedent to the taking of possession.\u00a0 When, therefore, the possession of the land is taken, the compensation is due; and if due and payable, it, in justice, ought to draw interest from that time.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>But it is said that when the company took possession on the 2d day of February, 1907, it deposited with the Insular Treasurer the value of the land and therefore ought not to pay interest on that amount.<br\/><br\/>The order made on that date was at the request of the company and in accordance with the provisions of section 1 of Act No. 1592, which is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"When condemnation proceedings are brought by any railway corporation, in any court of competent jurisdiction in the Philippine Islands, for the purpose of the expropriation of land for the proper corporate use of such railway corporation, said\u00a0 corporation shall have the right to enter immediately upon the possession of the land involved, after and upon the deposit by it with the Treasurer of the Philippine Islands of the value of the land, in money, as provisionally and promptly ascertained and fixed by the court having jurisdiction of the proceedings, said sum to be held by the Treasurer subject to the orders and final disposition of the court:\u00a0 <i>Provided, however<\/i>, That the court may authorize the deposit with the Insular Treasurer of a certificate of deposit of any depository of the Government of the Philippine Islands in lieu of cash, such certificate to be payable to the Insular Treasurer on demand in the amount directed by the court to be deposited.\u00a0 The certificate and the moneys represented thereby shall be subject to the orders and final disposition of the court.\u00a0 And in case suit has already been commenced on any land and the money deposited with the Insular Treasurer at the date of the passage of this Act, the said money may, upon proper order of the court, be withdrawn from the Treasury by the railway corporation which deposited the same, and a certificate of deposit, as above described, may be deposited in lieu thereof.\u00a0 And the court is empowered and directed, by appropriate order and\u00a0 writ if necessary, to place the railway corporation in possession of the land, upon the making of the deposit.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The defendant having claimed that his damages would amount to P19,398.42, the company deposited this sum, but it is very evident from the terms of the Act that this deposit was in no sense a payment nor an offer of payment by the company for the land.\u00a0 It simply guaranteed that the plaintiff would pay whatever sum might eventually be awarded to the defendant.\u00a0 The defendant had no right to withdraw this money on the 3d day of February, 1907, nor did he have any right to withdraw it until after the court had acted upon the report of the commissioners and entered its judgment, which it did on the 16th day of June, 1908.\u00a0 We therefore hold that the defendant would not secure just compensation for the property taken unless he received interest on its value from the 2d day of February, 1907 until the 16th day of June, 1908.<br\/><br\/>It remains to consider what interest the defendant is entitled to from the, last named date.\u00a0 It appears from the record that the company opposed the confirmation of the award.\u00a0 Its objections were so far successful that the court reduced the amount awarded by the commissioners.\u00a0 The owner was compelled to appeal and in his appeal has been so far successful as to reverse the action of the court below.\u00a0 Under these circumstances we think he is entitled to interest on the award until the final determination of this proceeding.\u00a0 What the result would be if he had failed in his appeal, we do not decide.\u00a0 The interest thus allowed will be interest upon the amount awarded by the commissioners from the 2d day of February, 1907, until payment.<br\/><br\/>3. The court below taxed the costs in the proceeding at P28, ordering that sum to be divided among the 72 defendants.\u00a0 The defendant claims that he is entitled to a separate bill of costs, as if he were the only defendant.\u00a0 Section 249 of the Code of Civil Procedure is as follows :<br\/><blockquote>\"The costs in all cases under this chapter\u00a0 relating to eminent domain shall be paid by the plaintiff; but in case the action is carried to the Supreme Court by the owner, the costs in the Supreme Court shall be paid by the owner if the judgment is affirmed.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>We consider this proceeding as, in substance, an ordinary action falling within the provisions of part one of the Code of Civil Procedure, and not as a special proceeding falling within the provisions of part two of that code.\u00a0 Section 249 has changed the general rule in regard to costs so that in this action the plaintiff must always pay the costs in the Court of First Instance, and the question is, whether he shall pay more than one bill of costs.\u00a0 The Act allows a company such as the plaintiff to include in one action all the tracts of land which it desires to condemn within any one province.\u00a0 As a general rule the defendants in such an action, so far as they are the owners of separate tracts of land, have no interest in common, and we think that where one defendant appears by himself alone and files an answer relating to a particular tract of land in which he-alone is interested, he is entitled to costs, as if he'were the only defendant.<br\/><br\/>As to the\u00a0 costs in the Supreme Court, we think that the general rule relating to costs here should be followed.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below is reversed and the case remanded with directions to confirm the report of the commissioners so far as the appellant is concerned, and to enter judgment in his favor for the sum of P10,746.25, with interest thereon at the rate of 6 per cent per annum from the 2d day of February, 1907, and the costs of the Court of First Instance as hereinbefore indicated.\u00a0 No costs will be allowed to either party in this court.\u00a0 So ordered,<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

A. Reynolds, chairman, and Treasurer J. Q. A. Braden and Third Member Luis Thomas, sitting as a board of canvassers, in accordance with the provisions of Act No. 1582, in its meeting of February 17 above quoted, proceeded to a canvass of the votes cast\u00a0 in said elections, with the result that, the exponent Agripjno Segovia received 340 votes for the office of president, while the other candidate Lucio Navarro also received 340 votes for the same office, according to the statements filed by the board of inspectors.\u00a0 The election thus resulted in a tie, and in the meeting held on the 18th of said month, the board decided the tie by lot in favor of Navarro, against the protest of plaintiff Segovia, and declared Navarro elected municipal president of Albay.\u00a0 Due protest was filed by Segovia with the Court of First Instance, and the latter, by an order dated March 14 of the same year, found that 333 votes were cast in favor of each candidate for the office of municipal president, and ordered the provincial board of canvassers to correct its canvass of the votes cast for the office of president of the newly organized municipality of Albay in accordance with the facts as proven.\u00a0 The\u00a0 plaintiff, on or about the 16th of March, requested the provincial board to advise him of the day and hour of the\u00a0 drawing of lots to decide the tie in accordance with the order of the court, in order that he, the plaintiff, might be present thereat.\u00a0 Said board, while it decided to correct the statements relating to the canvass of the votes cast in said election in accordance with the order of\u00a0 the court, nevertheless refused to draw lots to decide the tie, pursuant to the said ruling, it being the legal duty of the provincial board, as a board of canvassers, under the provisions of said law to draw lots to decide the tie between the candidates Segovia and Navarro, each of whom had received 333 valid and legal votes, and in the absence of appellate proceedings or a proper and speedy remedy to compel said provincial board to comply with the above-mentioned legal duty, the plaintiff prayed the court to issue a mandamus ordering the defendant members of the provincial board to draw lots as provided by the last paragraph of section 26, in its relation to sections 4 and 25 of the Election Law, in order to decide the tie between the contending candidates and to declare the successful candidate elected, with the costs and other legal expenses against the defendants.<br\/><br\/>The defendants having been summoned, counsel for Lucio Navarro demurred to the complaint on the ground that the complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, nor show any unlawful noncompliance with duty on the part of the defendants, to which might be applied the special relief sought.<br\/><br\/>The provincial fiscal, on behalf of the provincial board of Albay,\u00a0 also demurred to the complaint on the ground that the court had no jurisdiction of the proceedings, and that the complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, it not being alleged, what duty pertaining to the office held by the defendants had not been complied with by them.<br\/><br\/>The court, under date of April 14, in passing upon the demurrers, issued an order to the\u00a0 effect that according to the allegations of the complaint it was not the duty of the provincial board to again decide the tie by lot, and sustained the demurrers as regards the second ground thereof, granting the plaintiff leave to amend his complaint, if he so wished, to conform to the provisions of law and to set forth facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action; and should the plaintiff fail to file an amended complaint within five days, reckoned from the date of the order of the court, the action would be dismissed with the costs against the plaintiff.\u00a0 The latter excepted to said ruling and gave notice of his intention to bring the case to this court by bill of exceptions, alleging that the order of the lower court was erroneous and contrary to law.\u00a0 The proper bill of exceptions having been certified, it was forwarded to the office of the clerk of this court.<br\/><br\/>This is an\u00a0 appeal by bill of exceptions brought before this court for a determination of the question of whether an exception by the plaintiff to the ruling of the lower court sustaining a demurrer, can be submitted to the appellate court by bill of exceptions, notwithstanding the provisions of section 123 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u00a0 Section 101 of said code is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"When a demurrer to any pleading is, sustained, the party whose pleading is thus adjudged defective may amend his pleading within a time to be fixed by the court, with or without terms, as to the court shall seem just; but if the party fails to amend his pleading within the time limited or elects not to amend, the court shall render such judgment upon the subject-matter involved in the pleading and demurrer as the law and the facts of the case as set forth in the pleadings warrant.\u00a0 * * *\"<br\/><\/blockquote>When the demurrer to the complaint is sustained, the plaintiff may\u00a0 except to the order sustaining said demurrer, but he is not allowed by the law of procedure to take an appeal before the Supreme Court by means of bill of exceptions.<br\/><br\/>The said exception if\u00a0 taken in due time\u00a0 will be taken down in the course of the trial and will be made part of the bill of exceptions to be prepared and presented as a result of the exception or appeal taken against the final judgment rendered in the case.\u00a0 Section 123 of said code says:<br\/><blockquote>\"No interlocutory or incidental ruling, order, or judgment of the Court of First Instance shall stay the progress of an action or proceeding therein pending; but only such ruling, order, or judgment as finally determines the action or proceeding; nor shall any ruling, order, or judgment be the subject of appeal to the Supreme Court until final judgment is rendered for one party or the other.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Until the rendition of final judgment in the action it is not proper to bring the case before the Supreme Court by bill of exceptions for its determination in the second instance.<br\/><br\/>When the complaint is stayed by an order allowing and sustaining\u00a0 a demurrer, the plaintiff, having regard to his right to except to said order, is bound either to amend the complaint within the period designated in said order, or to give notice that he elects not to do so and insists upon his original complaint; and until the rendition of the final judgment of the court on the questions raised by said complaint and demurrer, he can not take an appeal by bill of exceptions, which must contain the exception taken against the order sustaining the demurrer.<br\/><br\/>The bill of exceptions shall be perfected in the form provided by section 143 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which among other things provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"Upon the rendition of final judgment disposing of the action, either party shall have the right to perfect a \"bill of exceptions, for a review by the Supreme Court of all rulings, orders, and judgments made in the action, to which the party has duly excepted at the time of making such ruling, order, or judgment.\u00a0 * * *.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Thus, the bill of exceptions shall contain all the exceptions taken in due time to all the rulings, orders and decrees made in the course of the trial, in order that they, together with the final judgment may be reviewed by the Supreme Court.<br\/><br\/>Inasmuch as the bill of exceptions in this case was presented as the result of an exception to an interlocutory order sustaining a demurrer, which, according to section 123, shall not stay the course of the proceeding, and as the court has not rendered final judgment in this action, it is therefore improper to present said bill of exceptions.\u00a0 (Following cases No. 3908, Serrano <i>vs<\/i>.

the accused's detailed and voluntarily extrajudicial confessions of his complicity in the commission of the crime; the testimony of Segundo Avila, one of his accomplices, who was present when the crime was committed; and a mass of circumstantial\u00a0 evidence which strongly tends to connect the accused with the commission of the crime, and to corroborate the testimony of his accomplice, and the truth of the facts admitted by the accused in his extrajudicial confessions.<br\/><br\/>On the morning of the 27th of March, 1908, the deceased, Andres Ablana, went, as was his custom, from his home to the barrio of Opias for the purpose of inspecting the work which was being done in his rice fields by a number of laborers, under the direction of his son-in-law.\u00a0 On the road from his home to his rice fields, at a point distant about 1 mile from the town of Tayabas, there is a bridge crossing the stream known as the Ibia.\u00a0 On that morning, one of the witnesses, named Enrique Valencia, happened to be bathing in the stream, and noticed that Andres Abla\u00f1a crossed the bridge going in the direction of his rice fields, and about three minutes thereafter was followed by his son, the accused.\u00a0 At midday, Andres Ablana returned to his house in Tayabas where he dined, and a short time thereafter set out again for his rice lands in Opias, carrying with him the midday meal for his son-in-law and the laborers who were working under the latter's direction.\u00a0 When he left the house, he carried at his side a bolo with &amp; silver-plated handle, which he had been accustomed to wear for a number of years prior to his death.<br\/><br\/>This was the last time he was seen alive except by the murderers who did him to death.\u00a0 Later on in the after-noon, his son-in-law, Fausto Bables, becoming impatient because of the failure of his father-in-law to arrive with his midday meal, went to the home of the deceased to discover the reason for the delay.\u00a0 On learning that his father-in-law had set out shortly after midday for the rice fields, with the food for the workmen, Bables returned to Opias, but not finding any trace of the missing man, he went to Tayabas to report to the municipal president his mysterious disappearance.\u00a0 On the following morning at an early hour, Babies, accompanied by others, continued the search for his father-in-law, and noticing loose grains of rice scattered on the ground near the\u00a0 point where the bridge crosses the stream Ibia, the searching party carefully examined the country thereabout, and found the body of Andres Abla\u00f1a sunk in the stream a short distance from the\u00a0 bridge, and held in place by a large stone.\u00a0 Notice was promptly given to the municipal authorities; and the municipal president, health officer, and justice of the peace, with others, went to the place where the body was laying, and brought it to Tayabas.\u00a0 An examination of the body left no room for doubt that death had been caused by a blow inflicted upon the back of the head, which crushed the occipital bone.\u00a0 The sum of P2.40 was found in the pockets.<br\/><br\/>Suspicion of criminal complicity in the mysterious disappearance of the deceased was promptly directed toward the accused, because of a bitter quarrel which he was known to have had with his father, and an order for his arrest was issued without delay.\u00a0 He was found in Lucena on the night of the day when the crime was committed, in company with Segundo Avila, and was brought to Tayabas where he was held in detention, pending further investigation.<br\/><br\/>While in detention, both the accused and his companion, Segundo Avila, made various statements in regard to the commission of the crime.\u00a0 One of the statements made by the accused was substantially as follows:\u00a0 That he had conspired with others to kill his father, because his father had refused to give him any more money, had threatened to disinherit him, and had refused to permit him to cultivate or to harvest a certain cocoanut grove; that the refusal of his father to allow, him to harvest the cocoanut grove, which occurred two days before the murder, caused him \"to lose his temper and reason,\" so that he immediately began making plans to kill his father; that on the 26th of March, the day before the crime, he met Segundo Avila on the streets of Tayabas, and offered him P50 to assist in killing his father, which offer was accepted; that they agreed to meet the following day at the bantayan, or lookout, near the crossing of the stream called the Ibia, in the barrio of Opias, at the time when his father would pass on his way to his work, and there put their plans into execution; that on arrival at the lookout the next morning he found Segundo Avila waiting for him together with Pastor de Rama, whom Avila had brought along to assist; that his father passed the lookout that morning about 9 or 10 o'clock, at which time they intended to kill him, but did not dare to do so, because of the accidental presence of a stranger; that, knowing his father's custom to return to his house for the laborers' midday meal, they waited there until shortly after midday, and that when his father passed by on his way back to the fields, De Rama struck him on the back of the head with a club; and that thereafter, De Rama and Avila disposed of the body at the place where it was found.\u00a0 This confession was made to F. W. Wilson, an employee of the Constabulary, in the presence of Major Smith, and of Pantaleon Reyes, a Constabulary sergeant in Major Smith's office.\u00a0 It was repeated in the presence of Major Smith, the sergeant, the municipal president, and various other persons who accompanied the accused to the scene of the commission of the crime where the accused pointed out the precise place where the various participants awaited their victim, and described in detail all that occurred.<br\/><br\/>The account of the confessions of the accused as related by the different witnesses vary in certain unimportant details, but the principal and essential facts, as set out in his different stories, are substantially the same, and leave no room for doubt that he, together with Pastor de Rama and Segundo Avila, lay in wait for the deceased, and killed him in the manner and form above set out, his accomplices having been induced to join him in killing his father, by the promises of reward and payment made them by the accused; and that, if the accused did not himself strike the deceased, he was present looking on and directly aiding in the commission of the crime, when one of his accomplices struck the fatal blow.<br\/><br\/>Segundo Avila also admitted to the Constabulary officers that he was present when the crime was committed, and accompanied several witnesses to the scene of the crime and pointed out the manner and\u00a0 form in which it was committed; at the trial he took the stand, and, while denying that he himself had taken a direct part in the commission of the crime, testified that he was there present, together with the accused and Pastor de Rama; that Pastor de Rama struck the fatal blow; and that thereafter the body of the deceased had been sunk in the stream at the place where it was found.\u00a0 This witness was instructed by the court that he need not testify to anything which would tend to incriminate him, but he insisted that he desired to testify, and, while he denied all direct personal participation in the crime, his story, in so far as it connects the accused with the murder of his father, was not, in the language of the trial court, shaken, although he was cross-examined at great length.<br\/><br\/>The defendant, who took the stand in his own behalf, denied all knowledge of the commission of the crime, and at first denied that he had confessed his participation therein, but, on cross-examination, admitted that he had told the witness, Wilson, that Segundo Avila had murdered his father; he added, however, that he made this statement because of fear of what the Constabulary might do to him, if he refused to obey their orders to charge Avila with the crime and because he had been maltreated by Wilson and other members of the Constabulary when under examination.\u00a0 Major Smith, Wilson, the Constabulary sergeant, the municipal president, and all the witnesses who testified to the various confessions made by the accused, swore positively that these confessions were voluntarily made, without threat, coercion, or promise of reward or immunity; and indeed we are convinced that\u00a0 the full, detailed statements made by the accused, both in the offices of the chief of Constabulary, and in the presence of a number of witnesses at the scene of the commission of the crime, were made voluntarily, and furnish a substantially accurate story of all that occurred.<br\/><br\/>The accuracy of these statements was corroborated in many particulars by the evidence of other witnesses for the prosecution.\u00a0 His direct participation in the crime is fully established by the testimony of his accomplice, and by the other evidence of record tending to establish his presence at or near the place where the crime was committed on the day of the murder.\u00a0 The testimony of the witness who saw him following his father early on the morning when the crime was committed, and who was bathing in the stream near the place where the accused said that he and his accomplices had intended to commit the crime in the morning but for the accidental presence of a stranger, substantiates an important detail of the story told by him in his confession; and in other important particulars his story of the way in which the fatal blow was struck, and of the mode of disposal of the body, was corroborated by the evidence of the witnesses who found the body and examined its condition when found.<br\/><br\/>His guilty connection with the commission of the crime was further independently established by the testimony of a witness who saw him not long after the time when the crime must have been committed, and before he went to Lucena, wearing the bolo which his father carried when he was last seen on his way to the place where he met his death.\u00a0 The accused offered no explanation at the trial of the way in which he had come into possession of his fathers bolo immediately after his death, and without some satisfactory explanation consistent with his innocence, this fact alone furnishes ground for a strong presumption as to his guilty participation in the commission of the crime.<br\/><br\/>We are satisfied, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the accused not only induced his accomplices by promise of reward to slay his own father, but that he himself was present, aiding and abetting, if he did not himself strike the fatal blow.\u00a0 We find no extenuating circumstances, and taking into consideration the fact that the crime was committed with treachery (<i>con alevosia<\/i>) by lying in ambush, and in an uninhabited place, the penalty prescribed by law for the crime of parricide, which is that of <i>cadena perpetua<\/i> to death, should be imposed in its maximum degree.\u00a0 We, therefore, should and do hereby affirm the judgment and sentence of the trial court, with the costs of, this instance against the accused.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson<\/i>, and <i>Willard, JJ<\/i>., concur<br\/><\/div>",

The  plaintiff alleges that on or about the month of January, 1907, it was the owner of the Oregon Saloon in Cavite, Province of Cavite, consisting of bar, furniture, furnishings, and fixtures, of the value of 1,000 pesos; that during the said month of January, 1907, the defendant Jose Desiderio, as sheriff, levied upon such property by virtue of an execution issued upon a judgment secured by the defendant Macke &amp; Chandler, against Stanley &amp; Krippendorf; that said plaintiff notified the sheriff, in the manner  provided by law, that it was the owner of said goods and forbade the  sale thereof under said execution; that, notwithstanding such claim upon the part of the plaintiff, the said sheriff sold said goods under said execution; that said firm of Macke &amp; Chandler was the purchaser of said goods and the same were delivered to it; that the  defendants Bachrach, Elser, and Gale, were the sureties upon the  bond given to the sheriff by Macke &amp; Chandler before said goods were  sold.  The defendants in this case allege that the property described by the plaintiff and sold at the execution sale referred to was not the property of the plaintiff at the time of said levy and sale, but was the property of Stanley &amp; Krippendorf, who were in possession of the same at the time of such levy.  They further allege that during the month of January, 1907, the said Stanley &amp; Krippendorf, being indebted in a considerable sum to the plaintiff in this case, attempted to sell to the said plaintiff by an instrument in writing the property in question; that said instrument was never recorded; that said instrument was a private document; that the said property was not delivered to the plaintiff under said sale but that said property remained from the time of said sale forward in the exclusive possession and control of said Stanley &amp; Krippendorf, and that they conducted the business subsequent to the execution of said instrument exactly as they had prior thereto  \u2014in their own name \u2014purchasing goods and paying therefor without reference to the plaintiff in this case.<br\/><br\/>The facts in relation to the manner and method in and by which the plaintiff obtained its alleged title to the goods in question and the fact of continued possession by Stanley &amp; Krippendorf, as set forth by the defendants, are substantially admitted in this case. <br\/><br\/>The question to be determined is the effect which the said instrument of sale had, if any, in transferring the property in question from Stanley  &amp; Krippendorf to the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>The case of the Fidelity and Deposit Company against Wilson (8 Phil.  Rep., 51) lays down a doctrine which we think is decisive of this case.  In that case it was held that the ownership of personal property can not be transferred to the prejudice of third persons except by delivery of the property itself; and that a sale without delivery gives the would-be purchaser no rights in said property except those of a creditor.  The bill of sale in the case at bar, under the circumstances of this case, could have no effect against a person dealing with the property upon the faith of appearances.  The case of Kuenzle &amp; Streiff against A. S. Watson &amp; Co. (7 Off. Gaz., 425),<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> cited by the appellant in its brief, does not sustain its contention.  That was a case of the sale of property upon the condition that the title  thereto should remain in the vendor until the purchase price thereof should be fully paid, and that, in case of nonpayment of the debt or of any installment thereof when due, the vendor would have a right to take possession of the property and deal with it as provided for in the contract.  In that case the court held that such a contract for the  conditional sale of goods was valid in these Islands between the parties thereto, and was valid also as to third persons, <i>provided possession of the property therein described was taken by the vendor before the rights of third persons intervened against the same<\/i>.  In the case at bar it is evident that the bill of sale, so called, was in no sense a conditional sale of property, such as is  described in the case of Kuenzle &amp; Streiff against A. S. Watson &amp; Co., and the principles applicable thereto are entirely inapplicable in the case at bar.  Moreover, possession of the property in suit was not taken at any time by the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>The defendant Macke &amp; Chandler, having purchased the property at an execution sale, properly conducted, obtained a good title to the property in question as against the plaintiff in this case.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below is, therefore, affirmed, with costs against the appellant.

G. Smith is held pending investigation of the military offense of desertion from the United States Army.\u00a0 The petition also alleged that the said H. G. Smith is not and never has been a soldier in the United States Army, and that his imprisonment and detention are without legal authority.<br\/><br\/>An order thereupon issued, requiring the commanding officer of the <i>Cuartel de Espa\u00f1a<\/i> to show cause, if any existed, why the writ should not issue.\u00a0 On the return day thereof, said commanding officer appeared in court and made return thereto as follows:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"The respondent, Lieut. Col. Arthur C. Ducat, Twentieth Infantry, United States Army, commanding officer, <i>Cuartel de Espa\u00f1a<\/i>, Manila, P. I., upon whom has been served an order to appear before the said court and show cause why a writ of habeas corpus in favor of the said H. G. Smith should not issue, respectfully makes return and states that he holds the said H. G. Smith by authority of the United States as a soldier in the United States Army.<br\/><br\/>\"That the said H. G. Smith was duly enlisted as a soldier in the service of the United States at Columbus Barracks, Ohio, December 18, 1906, under the name of Joseph C. McCartney, for a term of three years.<br\/><br\/>\"That the said H. G. Smith (<i>alias<\/i> Joseph C. McCartney) deserted said service at Pasay Camp near Manila, P. I., January 10,1908, and remained absent in desertion until he was apprehended at Manila, P. I., on or about September 1,1909, by the civil authorities, and was thereupon committed to the custody of the respondent as commanding officer of the post of Cuartel de Espa\u00f1a.<br\/><br\/>\"That the said H. G. Smith (<i>alias<\/i> Joseph C. McCartney) is held in confinement charged with the said offense of desertion and will be brought to trial as soon as practicable before a court-martial to be convened by the commanding general, Department of Luzon.<br\/><br\/>\"The respondent further makes return that the commanding general, Department of Luzon, under whose command he is acting, having certified that the said H. G. Smith (<i>alias<\/i> Joseph C. McCartney) is being held by him as a member of the Army, and this certificate being hereto attached and made part hereof, that, under the provisions of section 529, of Act No. 190, Philippine Commission, as amended by section 1, Act No. 272, and section 4, Act No. 421, of said Philippine Commission, this honorable court is without jurisdiction in the premises, and he therefore prays that the writ do not issue.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>Accompanying, and as a part of the return of the commanding officer, was the certificate of Brig. Gen. William H. Carter, commanding the Department of Luzon, to the effect that \"Joseph C. McCartney (<i>alias<\/i> H. G. Smith) is held in the custody of the United States by Lieut. Col. Arthur C. Ducat, Twentieth Infantry, commanding officer, <i>Cuartel de Espa\u00f1a<\/i>, Manila, P. I., as a member of the Army of the United States; to wit, as a private in Battery D, Fourth Field Artillery.\"<br\/><br\/>Upon this return the order to show cause must be discharged and the writ of habeas corpus denied.<br\/><br\/>Courts-martial are established by Congress by virtue of authority conferred by the Constitution to raise armies and make rules for the government and discipline thereof, and under this authority Congress may provide and has provided for the trial and punishment of persons in the military service of the United States.\u00a0 Such courts have plenary jurisdiction over offenses against military law.\u00a0 Persons not connected with the military service are not subject to military jurisdiction, but those who enter the military service surrender their rights to be tried by the civil courts.\u00a0 (Johnson <i>vs.<\/i> Sayre, 158 U. S., 109.)\u00a0 It follows that the civil courts can not through the use of the writ of habeas corpus deprive the proper military authorities of the right to hear and determine charges against persons who are in the military service and subject to military jurisdiction.\u00a0 Conflicts of authority between the civil and military powers have frequently resulted in delicate and embarrassing situations, and in order to avoid the possibility of such friction the legislature has specifically determined that certain evidence when produced in a specified manner shall be conclusive of the exclusive jurisdiction of the military authorities in certain cases.<br\/><br\/>The writ of habeas corpus is extended to all cases of illegal confinement or detention by which any person is deprived of his liberty, and by which the rightful custody of any person is withheld from the person entitled thereto, except in cases expressly provided.\u00a0 Persons properly in charge of the military authorities are excepted from the privileges of the writ, and the manner in which the fact that the petitioner is subject to military jurisdiction, and properly held in custody, shall be established is\u00a0 determined by ,the statute.\u00a0 Act No. 272, enacted October 21, 1901, provides that-<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"It shall be a conclusive answer to a writ of habeas corpus against a military officer or soldier, and a sufficient excuse for not producing the prisoner * * * if the commanding general, or any general officer in command of the department or district, shall certify that the prisoner is held by him either-<br\/><br\/>\"1.\u00a0 As a prisoner of war; or<br\/><br\/>\"2.\u00a0 As a member of the Army, a civilian employee thereof, or a camp follower and subject to its discipline; * * *.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>The conclusiveness of the return when properly made was recognized by this court in Mekin <i>vs.<\/i> Wolfe (2 Phil. Rep., 74), where it was certified as provided for by the law in such cases that the prisoner had been committed by a military court or commission prior to the year 1901.\u00a0 \"The certificate of the commanding officer,\" said the court, \"is in strict compliance with the provisions of the law, and was a conclusive return to the writ of habeas corpus.\u00a0 The power of the court to either issue the writ or discharge the prisoner is ended when such return has been made, and the proceedings must there end.\"<br\/><br\/>But counsel for the prisoner contends that a literal construction of this statute would render it invalid.\u00a0 We find no force in this contention, because the legislative authority had the\" power to determine what evidence should be required to establish a particular jurisdictional fact, and to determine that the fact when thus established should deprive the civil courts of the power to issue the writ.\u00a0 The certificate is not made conclusive upon the prisoner at his trial, and he will in the proper tribunal have ample opportunity to present his own evidence in contravention thereof.<br\/><br\/>Whether the petitioner is in fact the person referred to in the return, who enlisted in the United States Army, can not be determined by this court upon evidence taken at this time, as that\u00a0 is one of the material issues which must be determined by the court-martial when the prisoner is brought to trial.<br\/><br\/>The order to show cause is therefore discharged, and the petition for the writ of habeas corpus denied.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

and that, so far as they go, they contain a correct statement of the part taken by the appellant, Javier, in the affray in the course of which the death blows were inflicted:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"Upon seeing the witnesses, hearing them testify, and observing their conduct in court, and upon considering all the evidence introduced upon the trial of the cause, together with the arguments of counsel submitted therein, the court finds the following to be the facts proven:<br\/><br\/>\"1.\u00a0 That at the time and place mentioned in the complaint at about 10 o'clock in the nighttime of said day, the defendant Javier and Pedro Legaspi were engaged in a quarrel, resulting in the fight between the two, the said Pedro Legaspi having at the time and using the same a club, marked 'Exhibit A,' admitted upon the trial of the cause; thereupon the defendant Vicente Reyes, standing some distance, and within sight of said affray, immediately passed thereto, attempted to separate the said two parties, was stricken with said club by the said Pedro Legaspi, and then and there the said Vicente Reyes seized said club, took the same into his own possession, and struck with said club the said Pedro Legaspi two mortal blows upon his head from which within a few hours the said Pedro Legaspi died, in one of the hospitals in the city of Manila.<br\/><br\/>\"2.\u00a0 That while the defendant, Vicente Reyes, was striking the said Pedro Legaspi over the head with said club as aforesaid, the defendant Severo Javier was holding firmly the said Pedro Legaspi, so that the said defendant, Vicente Reyes, could inflict said wounds without serious or substantial resistance; that there was no necessity for the use of said club by the defendant Vicente Reyes, as aforesaid, as if he had been in earnest and had only desired to save further trouble between the defendant Severo Javier and Pedro Legaspi, the same could have been easily accomplished without the use of any weapon whatever.\u00a0 The defendants, according to their testimony submitted upon the trial, and according to their appearance upon the trial, are men abundantly able to have determined the controversy between Severo Javier and Pedro Legaspi without the employment of any weapon, or even the necessity of inflicting any wounds upon the person of the said Pedro Legaspi.\" <\/blockquote><br\/>Accepting these findings of fact as correct, there can be no doubt of the guilt of Vicente Reyes, but we think they fall far short of sustaining a judgment of conviction of his codefendant, Javier, since it does not expressly appear therefrom that there was any concerted action between Reyes and Javier looking to the infliction of the fatal blows; and in the case of The United States <i>vs.<\/i> Manayao et al.\u00a0 (4 Phil. Rep., 293), we held that-<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"Where one of two persons jointly engaged in a quarrel with others stabs and kills one of his opponents, his companion can not be held as principal or accomplice where it does not appear that there was some concerted action leading up to the striking of the fatal blow, or that said companion had any reason to believe that a deadly attack was to be made on the deceased.\" <\/blockquote><br\/>Reyes admitted that\u00a0 when he intervened to stop the quarrel between Javier and Legaspi, he became so blindly enraged when he was struck with the club in the hands of Legaspi that he seized the club, and with eyes closed began to rain blows upon the offender.\u00a0 Other witnesses testified that at the time when Reyes intervened for the purpose of stopping the fight, Javier, who was\u00a0 unarmed, was holding Legaspi in such a position as to prevent Legaspi from striking him with the club which he had in his hand; that when Reyes came within range of the club in the hands of Legaspi, he received a blow which appeared to enrage him, and that immediately thereafter he got possession of the club and\u00a0 forthwith struck Legaspi twice over the head.\u00a0 This testimony, taken together with the findings of fact by the trial judge, would seem to establish conclusively that in inflicting the fatal blows Reyes acted wholly upon his own initiative; and that taking advantage\u00a0 of the fact that Javier happened to be holding Legaspi, he struck Legaspi over the head, so suddenly and so unexpectedly that it would be wholly unreasonable to say that Javier voluntarily cooperated with him in committing the offense.\u00a0 It is impossible to say from the record whether Javier or Legaspi was the original aggressor in the fight which was in progress when Reyes intruded himself between them, and it well may be that Javier, who was wholly unarmed, was within his rights when he took hold of Legaspi to prevent him from making use of his club; but, however this may be, it is quite clear from all the record that he did not take hold of Legaspi or continue to hold him for the purpose of aiding Reyes in striking Legaspi upon the head; and that there was no concerted action between Javier and Reyes nor voluntary cooperation on the part of Javier, in the homicidal attack, the sudden and unexpected intervention of Reyes not having given any opportunity therefor.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of conviction and the sentence of the trial court, in\u00a0 so far as they relate to the appellant, Javier, should be and are hereby reversed, and Javier should be and is hereby acquitted of the crime of homicide with which he was charged, with his share of the costs <i>de oficio<\/i>, and he will be discharged forthwith.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

on the following day, Saturday, the 20th of July, as the accused was going by the house of his manager, on his \"hacienda, he asked him if the said tax had been paid to the aforesaid treasurer, to which Puentebella replied in the affirmative, whereupon Lopez went on his way in the direction of Silay.\u00a0 This appears from the testimony of the defendant, confirmed by his manager Puentebella, although it is also a fact that the aforesaid amount was not paid into the municipal treasury, nor did the treasurer receive it on the said date for the reason that Puentebella failed to find the said official when he called at his office and the money was delivered to Simplicio Adeva, a clerk in said treasury, and believing that the latter had turned it over to the said treasurer, Puentebella, when questioned\u00a0 on the following day, the 20th of July, by the accused, Marciano Lopez, replied that the tax had been paid as ordered by him.<br\/><br\/>From the foregoing facts which have been duly proven it would appear that when the accused took the oath on the morning of Monday, the 22d of July, and took possession of the office of acting municipal president of Silay, he did so believing that he was not a delinquent taxpayer, and that he had paid his indebtedness three days before, basing his belief on the affirmative answer given him by his manager when he asked the latter on the following day if the sum handed him on the day before had been paid into the municipal treasury.<br\/><br\/>In order to establish the fact that the defendant, Marciano Lopez,\u00a0 knowing that he was a delinquent taxpayer and as such ineligible to hold the office of municipal president, nevertheless took the oath, stating that he possessed the necessary qualifications therefor, and actually entered upon his duties as municipal president of Silay, it is indispensable to prove that the accused performed said official acts in bad faith and with certain knowledge that, on the 22d day of July, he was still delinquent in the payment of the tax, which, according to his manager, had been paid on the 19th of the said month.\u00a0 The honest belief and firm conviction that his indebtedness to the Government had been paid on the 19th or 20th of July, are incompatible with the charge preferred against him of having taken possession of the presidency with malicious intent to violate the Election Law.<br\/><br\/>In view of the fact that satisfactory evidence of the culpability imputed to the accused herein is lacking, it is our opinion that the judgment appealed from should be reversed, and that Marciano Lopez should be absolved, as we do hereby absolve him with the costs of both instances <i>de oficio<\/i>.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

the Philippine Islands authorizes an oath to be administered, that he will testify, declare, depose, or certify truly, or that any written testimony, declaration, deposition, or certificate by him subscribed is true, willfully and contrary to such oath states or subscribes any material matter which he does not believe to be true, is guilty of perjury, and shall be punished by a fine of not more than two thousand pesos and by imprisonment for not more than five years; and shall, moreover, thereafter be incapable of holding any public office or of giving testimony in any court of the Philippine Islands until such time as the judgment against him is reversed.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>This section in terms covers this case and any other case of perjury committed in court, and, if it stood by itself, there could be no question but that it would be inconsistent with the provisions of the Penal Code and would impliedly repeal them.<br\/><br\/>The claim of the appellant is, however, that the section must be limited in its operation by reason of the other provisions of the Act in which it is found and by the title of that Act.<br\/><br\/>That title is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"An Act authorizing the appointment of commissioners to make official investigations and fixing their powers, for the payment of witness fees, and for the punishment of perjury in official investigations.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Section 1 of the Act is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Whenever, in the discretion of the Governor-General, it is necessary for the good of the\u00a0 public service to investigate any action or conduct of any person or persons in the Insular, provincial, or municipal service, he may by order designate a suitable person to make such investigation and to take the testimony of any person or persons which, in his judgment, may be relevant thereto, and may detail or authorize the said person designated to procure stenographers and interpreters to assist in the same.\u00a0 Such person so designated shall have such full power to subpoena witnesses and\u00a0 require the production of documentary evidence and to administer oaths to witnesses as is possessed by<br\/>Courts of First Instance in criminal actions and may invoke the summary process of such courts for the punishment of contempts in failure to appear or to produce evidence or to give testimony.\u00a0 All interpreters\u00a0 acting in any such proceeding shall be first duly sworn well and truly to interpret between the counsel, the witnesses, and the person so designated, and the stenographers shall be sworn to make a true transcript of the testimony given on such proceeding.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It is said in the first place by the appellants that the Act would be void if construed so as to be applicable to perjury committed in ordinary actions in court, and, in support of that claim, section 5 of the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902, is cited, wherein it is said:<br\/><blockquote>\"That no private or local bill which may be enacted into law shall embrace more than one subject, and that subject shall be expressed in the title of the bill.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It is very apparent that the general subject of perjury is not expressed in the title to this Act, and, if this provision of the law is applicable to the Act in question, the contention of the appellant must be sustained.\u00a0 But the provision is not applicable, for it relates only to private or local bills.\u00a0 This\u00a0 Act is in no sense either private or local.\u00a0 The official translation of this section into Spanish may throw some doubt on its proper construction, but the English text is plain.<br\/><br\/>It is further said that section 3, if it is construed as claimed by the Attorney-General, would be void as being in violation of section 1 of Act No. 6 of the Laws of the Commission, which was approved on the 26th of September, 1900, and which\u00a0 prescribed the order of procedure of the Commission in the enactment of laws.\u00a0 That section provides as follows :<br\/><blockquote>\"(<i>b<\/i>)\u00a0 All Acts shall, before the enacting clause, be prefaced by a title stating the purpose and scope of the Act.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>This provision being found only in an Act of the Commission, it was entirely within the power of the Commission to repeal it entirely or to disregard it in any particular ease.\u00a0 It, therefore, is important only as a means for determining what the real intention of the Commission was in the enactment of said section 3.\u00a0 Did it intend to limit its operation to false swearing before such a commissioner as is named in section 1, or did it intend to make the prohibition general and extend it to all cases of perjury?\u00a0 We have no doubt that the latter was the real intention.\u00a0 If it had been the intention of the legislative body to limit the section to official investigations, it would have been expressed in entirely different language.\u00a0 The section would have read, in such case, as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Any person who, having taken an oath before such commissioner that he will testify truly, and willfully and contrary to such oath states any material matter which he does not believe to be true, is guilty of perjury.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>If such had been the intention of the Commission, there would have been no provision for cases arising before a competent tribunal.\u00a0 There would have been no provision in regard to depositions or certificates, because the commissioner appointed in accordance with the provisions of section 1 has no power to receive certificates or depositions or affidavits, but only to examine witnesses and receive documentary evidence.<br\/><br\/>Sections 3 and 4 of Act No. 1697 are copied, with the necessary changes only, from sections 5392 and 5393 of the Revised Statutes of the United States.\u00a0 These sections constitute the general law relating to perjury in the United States, considered as a Government separate from that of the States.<br\/><br\/>There is another reason which is entitled to

No. 4704, April 26, 1909<\/h2>\n<h3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, <i>VS.<\/i> JOAQUIN GIL, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>CARSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">The information filed in this case charges the accused, Joaquin Gil, with the crime of assassination, in that on the 27th day of December, 1907, in the city of Iloilo, he entered the office of Benito Lopez, governor of the Province of Iloilo, and then and there treacherously (<i>con alevosia<\/i>) and with deliberate premeditation fired four shots from a loaded revolver at the said Governor Benito Lopez, who was at the time engaged in the execution of the duties of his office as governor, and inflicted upon him four wounds from the effects of one or all of which he died on the 20th day of January, 1908.<br\/><br\/>It was conclusively proven that on the morning of the 27th of December, 1907, the accused entered the office of Governor Lopez, who was at that time alone in his office, engaged in the transaction of public business; that a short time thereafter four pistol shots were fired in the office, that a few moments later Lopez ran from the room in a wounded condition, pursued by the accused with a smoking revolver in. his hand; and that Lopez died twentyr-four days later as a result of the wounds received on that occasion. Gil, the accused, testifying in his own behalf, stated that he went to the government building on the morning in question for the purpose of taking out a license to keep in his possession a revolver; that learning that the governor was unoccupied he entered his office, took a few steps toward the governor who was seated at his roll-top desk, at the same time drawing the revolver from its holster, and with the pistol lying in his outstretched hand addressed to the governor the question: \"May I?\" (<i>Se puede?<\/i>); that the governor glanced up at him, with a \"fierce\" look on his face, and resumed his work at his desk; that nothing more was said or done for a considerable space of time, not less than five minutes, when the governor raised his head and said: \"What do you want?\" that he (Gil) then approached the desk where the governor was seated and told him that he had come to ask for the favor of a license for the revolver; that the governor forthwith, and without the slightest provocation on Gil's part, answered in an insulting manner, upbraiding Gil for his temerity in seeking a favor of a man whom he had denounced to higher authority, and wound up his insulting and abusive tirade by calling Gil an <i>infeliz<\/i> (\"miserable creature,\" or as translated by counsel for defense \"coward\") and an <i>hijo de puta<\/i> (son of a whore); that he, Gil, then fell into a fit of ungovernable rage, which was the more intense because it is true that he was born out of lawful wedlock, and the governor having reached for the revolver, a struggle ensued during which the shots were fired, but that he, Gil, had so completely lost control of himself and was so filled with rage and indignation by the aspersions on his own and his mother's name and reputation, that he could not remember whether he himself had fired the shots which wounded the governor, or whether the pistol had been discharged accidentally in the course of the struggle for its possession.<br\/><br\/>The prosecution, on the other hand, insists that the shooting was the result of a deliberate, willful and premeditated plan; that Gil went to the government building on the morning, in question, not for the purpose of securing a license, but with intent to kill his enemy, the provincial governor, incited thereto by intense hatred and animosity, which had been engendered by bitter personal and political quarrels; that his pretense of securing a license was a mere pretext adopted for the purpose of securing admission to the office of the governor, while the latter was alone; that when he entered the office the governor was seated, not at the desk as alleged by the accused, but at the end of a long table, where he was engaged in writing an official indorsement; that the accused crossed the room to a point about half way down the length of the table, where he stopped and immediately commenced firing at the governor, who being unarmed arose from his seat, and attempted to escape into the adjoining office, the accused pursuing him into a corridor connecting the two offices.<br\/><br\/>If the account of what occurred in the office of the deceased governor on the morning of the 27th of December, 1907, as told by the accused when testifying in his own behalf, be accepted as true, this testimony, taken together with the other evidence of record not in conflict therewith, would leave no room for doubt of his guilt of the crime of unlawfully taking the life of Benito Lopez, deceased, the commission of the crime being marked with certain extenuating circumstances, but unmarked either by \"treachery\" (<i>alevosia<\/i>) or \"deliberate premeditation\" (<i>premeditacion conocida<\/i>) as charged in the information; and as the slayer was alone with his victim when the fatal shots were fired no eyewitness could be called to the stand to contradict the testimony of the accused as to what occurred in the office from the time he entered until the explosion of the pistol shots attracted the attention of the other occupants of the building. In our opinion, however, the ante-mortem statement of the deceased, taken together with the other evidence of record, conclusively establishes not only the falsity in all its essential details of the account of the tragedy given by the accused, but also the fact that the crime was committed with treachery (<i>alevosia<\/i>) and deliberate premeditation <i>(premeditacion conocida<\/i>).<br\/><br\/>The dying declaration of the wounded man is set out in full in the following extract from the testimony of the fiscal of the Province of Iloilo (translated from the original Spanish), which was fully corroborated by the testimony of the justice of the peace of Iloilo:<br\/><blockquote> \"Q.\u00a0 Did you see Governor Lopez on the 20th of January, 1908?\u00a0 If so, where?-A.\u00a0 Yes, sir, at the Mission Hospital.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 At what hour of the day did you see him?-A.\u00a0 I saw him between 7 and 8, or perhaps a little later.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 In which part of the Mission Hospital did you see Governor Lopez?-A.\u00a0 In the room where they placed him and where Governor Lopez was lying in bed.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 In what physical condition was Governor Lopez at the time you saw him?-A.\u00a0 We noticed that his breathing was so labored that it seemed to me that he was in a dying condition.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 Who were in the room at the time?-A.\u00a0 I went in twice, the last time to get his testimony-I, Captain Lewis, Colonel La Garde, I, Arsenio Jimenez, the justice of the peace, a sick American woman, and Doctor Hall-those are the persons whom I saw.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 What conversation did you have with Governor Lopez at that time, if any?<br\/><br\/>\"(I object to that, as immaterial and irrelevant.<br\/><br\/>\"Overruled.<br\/><br\/>\"Exception.)<br\/><br\/>\"A.\u00a0 I asked him if he was convinced that he would die and whether he had any hopes of living.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 What was the first question you asked Governor Lopez?-A.\u00a0 'Are you convinced that you are going to die, and have you no hopes of living?'\u00a0 He answered 'Yes.'<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 Was there any other conversation?-A.\u00a0 Yes, sir, I then asked him:\u00a0 'Was there any provocation on your part against Gil?' 'None' I then asked him, 'Did you insult him ?'\u00a0 He answered, 'Not at all.' I then finally asked him, 'How did it happen?' He answered, 'Gil came in and fired at once.'\u00a0 In view of the fact that he had almost said the last word, and was breathing in more labored fashion, and that he bade us 'good by,' we could not proceed [to question him] because we thought he was dying.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 Was this testimony put in writing?-A.\u00a0 No; because we had sent for a stenographer as we had been told that he could only live a few minutes, and the stenographer did not arrive.<br\/><br\/>\" (I object because it is not an answer to the question.<br\/><br\/>\"It is not sustained.<br\/><br\/>\"Exception.)<br\/><br\/>\"A.\u00a0 We had sent for a stenographer but, in view of the fact that he was long in coming and the physicians had told us that in all probability he would not live more than 2 to 5 minutes, as soon as the justice of the peace arrived, we entered the room in order to take the testimony.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>As will be seen, the dying declaration of the wounded man flatly contradicts the testimony of the accused as to the alleged provocation and insult;-the chief bulwark of the defense against the evidence of the prosecution tending to prove the existence of deliberate premeditation; and it as flatly contradicts the statement of the accused, that he did not fire the fatal shots for some five minutes after he entered the office and not until a wordy quarrel had arisen during which his opponent had full opportunity to assume an attitude of defense, of which he availed himself;-the chief bulwark of the defense against the evidence of the prosecution tending to prove that the accused committed the crime with \"treachery\" (<i>alevosia<\/i>), in that he opened fire on his unarmed and defenseless victim without giving him time or opportunity to offer resistance.\u00a0 But it must be admitted, as claimed by the counsel for the defense, that the account of what occurred, as given by the dying man, is so meager and incomplete that, in itself, and if it were not corroborated by other evidence of record, as will hereinafter appear, it would be by no means sufficient to sustain a finding of the falsity of the account given by the accused.<br\/><br\/>The trial court found that it was conclusively established by the testimony of the witnesses who saw the accused enter the governor's office and later heard the shots fired, that the shooting took place within a few moments after the entry of the accused, the interval not being more than long enough to give the accused time to walk from the door to the point at the side of the table from which, as claimed by the prosecution, the other evidence in the record shows the accused fired at least one shot.\u00a0 There appears to be some uncertainty in the testimony of some of the witnesses as to the precise duration of this interval of time, but we think that the weight of the evidence fully sustains this finding of the trial court and corroborates the truth and accuracy of the ante-mortem statement, while it conclusively demonstrates the falsity of the testimony of the accused in this regard.<br\/><br\/>We think, too, that there can be no reasonable doubt of the falsity of the statement of the accused that when he entered the office the governor was seated, writing, at a roll-top desk which stood in one corner of the office, the truth being that he was seated at the end of the long table mentioned in the following extract from the testimony of Captain Lewis, who examined the office immediately after the shooting:<br\/><blockquote>\"Q.\u00a0 You may examine this plan and state if it represents accurately the governor's and secretary's office in the provincial building at Iloilo?-A.\u00a0 I can not say if it is exact because I have not measured it, but as far as I know it is correct.\u00a0 I have been in the governor's office a number of times and I noted the different pieces of furniture on the day the governor was shot; they appeared that day as they are here on this map.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 The table at the point A in the governor's office-I will ask you if it occupied the same relative position as is represented on this map, on the 27th day of December, 1907?-A.\u00a0 Yes, sir.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 The desk C in the governor's office-I will ask you if it occupied the same relative position as is designated on this plan, on the 27th day of December, 1907?-A.\u00a0 It did.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 In the secretary's office the desk at the point P, designated as the secretary's desk-I will ask you if that desk occupied the same relative position in the secretary's office as is designated on this plan, on the 27th of December, 1907?-A.\u00a0 It did.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 I will ask you if the desk R in the secretary's office occupied the same relative position as it does on this plan-on the 27th of December, 1907?-A. Yes, sir, it did.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 And the desk S, did it occupy the same relative position on the 27th of December, 1907?-A.\u00a0 It did.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 When you returned to the governor's office or when you went to the governor's office on the 27th of December, 1907, state whether or not you observed anything on and about the table A.\u00a0 If so, what?-A.\u00a0 There was a blotter at the end of the table where the circle marked D and on top of the blotter there was an indorsement, or communication that had two indorsements on it, and a little farther up on the blotter in front of the chair was the envelope that had been opened on the end, addressed to the Honorable Governor of Iloilo Province; a little nearer the chair was a scratch pad lying down with a sheet something similar to the size of regular legal size typewriting paper-had part of an indorsement written on it-with ink, in the governor's handwriting and as I read it-it was in Spanish, and as I read it-'Respectfully returned to the Executive Secretary of the Philippine Islands, inviting his attention to the preceding indorsement' with the date of December 27, 1907, at the top; the pen was lying down about the center of this piece of paper as if dropped, judging from the drop of ink under the point of the pen to the right at the margin of the sheet of paper which he was writing on-partly on the sheet and partly on the blotter; there were other pieces of paper lying around and other correspondence that had not been opened.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 State whether or not when you made that examination there was a chair near the end of this desk at the point marked D.-A.\u00a0 Yes, sir; facing the desk, inclined to the left of the position of a man sitting-as if some one had gotten up and passed to the left.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 What, if anything, did you find or observe upon the desk C?-A.\u00a0 There were some books lying on top of each end of the desk and in the center there was a straw hat that I recognized as being that of the governor by seeing the name written inside of the sweat band; it was a telescope hat, and on top of it there was a paper case; roller-top desk, and sitting at the back of it was a revolving office chair.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>That at least one shot was fired at the deceased as he was in the act of rising from his seat at the end of the long table appears from the foregoing extract from the testimony of Captain Lewis, read together with the following extract from the testimony of Capt. Charles Gearhardt, of the United States Army, which was fully corroborated by the testimony of Captain Lewis (both of these witnesses being men of long experience in handling firearms) and by the testimony of Mr. T. L. Wilson, treasurer of the province, who with Captain Lewis carefully examined the position of the bullet mentioned in Captain Gearhardt's testimony, before it was extracted from the wall of the office in which it was imbedded:<br\/><blockquote>\"A.\u00a0 I will state that I first examined the hole and found that the bullet had entered not squarely into the wall but at an angle, and it is plain to be seen by examining it by this magnifying glass that a part of the mortar of the wall has come away and that the right-hand edge of it has crumbled somewhat.\u00a0 Examining the bullet you find that it has mushroomed some, but it just fits-this bullet was handed to me as the one taken out of the hole in the wall-and setting it in and holding it in place it fits very well; to determine the angle by the bullet from an examination by the eye and using the magnifying glass and setting in the pencil which I have in my hand I determined the angle to be about as I have it here now.\u00a0 I also verified this angle afterward, and by setting the bullet in and aiming that pencil so that by having the pencil in place as I have indicated and following its trace back through the air as it naturally would have gone I determined that, within narrow limits, to the best of my judgment, the pistol was held by some one standing about in this position.<br\/><br\/>\"MR, BLANCHARD (interrupting).\u00a0 About the center of the south side of the table marked A.<br\/><br\/>\"THE WITNESS (continuing).\u00a0 The actual position held by the party firing the pistol would depend considerably upon his height, for this line I have traced simply traces for one of about my height.<br\/><br\/>\"MR. BLANCHARD.\u00a0 I would suggest that the attention of Captain Gearhardt be called to the defendant as to his size,<br\/><br\/>\"THE WITNESS (after standing up alongside of defendant).\u00a0 The shoulders are almost the same.<br\/><br\/>\"A.\u00a0 (continued.) Within limits, due to judgment and opinion, I should say that that is the path that the bullet went over when it entered the wall-right over about here.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 If a man were sitting in that chair-the chair marked D-at the time the bullet was fired from the position you have indicated, and the bullet should pass through the right shoulder of the man, coming out at the back, in what position in your opinion, would be the man shot?-A.\u00a0 I should say that the man was not sitting in the chair at the time he was shot; he was in the act of rising or had partially risen.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Four shots were fired, all of which took effect in the body of the deceased, and if the testimony of these witnesses be accepted as correct (and the trial judge so accepted it after a personal examination of the relative positions of the table, chair, and the hole in the wall with the bullet placed therein as it was found immediately after the shooting), there can be no reasonable doubt that at least one shot was fired while the governor was m the act of rising from his seat at the end of the table and before he had an opportunity to take any measures to defend himself.<br\/><br\/>The defense put one witness on the stand to corroborate the testimony of the accused as to the insulting language addressed to him, and this witness swore that from an adjoining office he heard the governor make use of the word <i>infeliz<\/i> (\"contemptible creature\" or \"coward\") and immediately thereafter the movement of a chair being pushed back and the explosion of the pistol shot, but that he did not hear the governor make use of the words <i>hijo de puta<\/i>.\u00a0 The prosecution offered a number of witnesses who, at the time of the shooting, were in the same office with the witness for the defense and in other offices adjoining the governor's office, and the testimony on this point tends strongly to prove that if the insulting language quoted by the accused was used at all, it was used in a voice so low that it could not be heard by anyone in the adjoining offices, although these offices were connected with the governor's office by open doors and windows through which the human voice could readily be heard, the passage of sound being impeded merely by light screens intended to cut off the view from one office to the other.\u00a0 This testimony of itself is of course not sufficient to sustain a finding that such language was not in fact used; but, taken together with the positive denial contained in the ante-mortem statement, and keeping in mind the proven falsity of other essential details of the testimony of the accused, the proof that shots were fired almost immediately after the accused entered the office, and the fact that the witness who claims to have heard the word <i>infeliz<\/i> did not hear the words <i>hijo de puta<\/i>, although he says that the governor was speaking in an \"altered\" (excited) tone of voice; we think that the trial court properly found that no such series of insults had been directed to the accused by the deceased as were claimed by him, and that beyond a reasonable doubt, the words <i>hijo de puta<\/i> were not used at all; and this conclusion is confirmed by the consideration of the inherent improbability of his testimony in this regard, for it is difficult to believe that Governor Lopez, if he were in his right senses, would, without provocation, hurl such deadly insults at his enemy while that enemy was standing before him with a loaded revolver in his outstretched hand.<br\/><br\/>Thus far we have limited ourselves to a review of the evidence which tends to corroborate the wounded man's dying declaration that his assailant entered his office and without provocation immediately (<i>en seguida<\/i>) began firing upon him, and to contradict the testimony of the accused as to what occurred in the office at the time when the shooting took place.\u00a0 We shall now proceed to summarize the great mass of testimony which in our opinion tends directly to establish the contention of the prosecution that the crime was the result of a deliberately premeditated plan.<br\/><br\/>This witness, Anastasio Pefias, testified that he overheard the accused, just before he entered the government building, tell his carromato driver to wait for him, but if he heard shots to drive home at once.\u00a0 Commenting on the testimony of this witness, the trial judge says, \"it is denied by the accused and strenuously attacked by his counsel\" but \"in the opinion of the court it is true,\" and \"the court believes this witness told the truth.\"\u00a0 We find nothing in the record which would justify us in doubting the truth of the testimony of this witness or the correctness of the findings of the trial judge in that regard.<br\/><br\/>Ramon Lopez, a brother of the deceased, who rushed into the office immediately after the shots were fired and found the accused and his brother alone in the corridor running round the building, swore that when he came up to them, and before he snatched the revolver from the accused, he asked what was the matter (<i>que esta pasando?<\/i>), whereupon the accused exclaimed:\u00a0 \"For some time past I have wanted to kill you-I have wanted to kill you!\" (<i>Hacia ya tiempo que queria matarte-yo queria matarte.<\/i>)<br\/><br\/>Jose Santiago, secretary of the provincial board of Iloilo, to whom the accused in his testimony referred as his personal friend before the incident took place, swore that after the accused had been arrested and taken to the provincial jail in the lower part of the government building, he (the witness) was directed by the provincial treasurer to go to see the accused and find out if he needed anything, and that when he found the accused in his cell, he asked him what had happened, to which the accused replied:\u00a0 \"I had thought this thing out already.\" (<i>Ya tenia eso pensado<\/i>.)<br\/><br\/>Captain Lewis testified that, some little time after the shooting, the accused in his cell stated to him (in the language of the witness), \"that Governor Lopez had been instrumental through his brothers in trying to get a woman by the name of Paz Buenaflor to make certain allegations against him in the Court of First Instance, since he had married the daughter of Angel Corteza, in Molo\" (about two weeks prior to the shooting), \"and for that reason he stood under the abuse of the governor as long as he could, and that he told his <i>mujer<\/i> (I interpreted that for his wife) the night before, that he was going to see the governor the following morning and have a settlement.\"<br\/><br\/>The accused vehemently denied having made the statements testified to by Captain Lewis, Santiago and Ramon Lopez, and swore that he could not have made such statements, because, while he was politically opposed to Governor Lopez, their personal relations had been friendly and he had harbored no such feelings of hatred and animosity toward Lopez prior to the shooting as those statements would indicate. We are convinced, however, that whatever friendly personal relations may have at one time existed, those relations must have been strained to the breaking point by the intensely bitter and acrimonious political quarrel which gave rise to the formal charges against Governor Lopez of official misconduct, bribery, and other criminal offenses which were submitted by the accused to higher authority and pressed by him in the official investigation which followed, during the month prior to the shooting; and it is hardly credible that such friendly personal relations could have survived the filing of these charges by the accused; and that the differences between the accused and Governor Lopez were not wholly impersonal and limited to political issues is made very clear by the testimony of the father-in-law of the accused, who was called as a witness for the defense, and swore that about a month before the shooting and a short time prior to the marriage of the accused with the daughter of the witness, Governor Lopez tried to get the witness not to consent to the marriage, telling him that Gil was a bad man and reminding him of Gil's \"mother's antecedents.\"<br\/><br\/>While it is possible that Ramon Lopez, the brother of the deceased, might have been actuated by sentiments of revenge in testifying as he did, no such motives can be attributed to either Lewis or Santiago, and we think the trial court properly declined to believe the vehement denials of the accused, and rightly accepted the testimony of these witnesses as a true and correct relation of the substance of the statements made by him, for there is nothing in the record to justify4 the contention of the defense that they deliberately, willfully and maliciously invented these statements; and the meaning and effect of their testimony can not be softened by any suggestion of misunderstanding or mistake.<br\/><br\/>The fact that the accused, when he entered the provincial building on the morning in question, anticipated the firing of pistol shots, and his admissions that what occurred had been thought out or planned before it took place, and that stung by real or fancied personal wrongs he had told his wife the night before that he would have a settlement with the governor on the following morning; convince us, beyond a reasonable doubt, that his real purpose in seeking admission to the governor's office was not to secure a license for his pistol, but to wreak vengeance on his personal and political enemy; and this conclusion is confirmed by an examination of the evidence of record as to the circumstances under which the pretended application for a license was made, the mariner in which he claims to have submitted his application, and his conduct immediately after the shooting took place.<br\/><br\/>The accused himself admitted on the witness stand that he had owned the pistol in question since the days of the insurrection (six years, more or less) without a license, and that it had been under his immediate control for more than six months prior to the shooting; that on one occasion he had aided a friend in securing such a license from the provincial inspector of Constabulary, and that while he did not know whether the provincial inspector was authorized to grant such licenses without the intervention of the provincial governor, he had made no effort to learn whether this was the fact or not.\u00a0 Even in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it would be difficult to believe that the accused, in good faith, walked into the office of his enemy, and suddenly presented himself before that enemy with his loaded revolver in his extended right hand, merely for the purpose of asking for a license therefor, and this without taking the trouble to inquire whether the license could be obtained from another official who, he had reason to believe, had authority to issue it, and with whom he had no quarrel; and the air of improbability of the story is increased when it is remembered that although he had owned the revolver for many years he did not find it incumbent upon him to make an application for a license until the precise moment when his personal and political quarrel with the deceased was at its height; and that, despite the existence of that quarrel, his alleged desire to obtain the license at that particular time was so great that, although it was necessary for that purpose to ask an official favor of his enemy, he could not await the resolution of superior authority, which was still pending, as to whether his enemy's reelection to office would be affirmed, in view of the charges filed against him.<br\/><br\/>It also appears from the record, on the testimony of irreproachable witnesses, that immediately after the shooting and before the accused was taken to the provincial jail, he was apparently in a state of tense mental exaltation, and gave vent to cries to those around him which would tend to disclose that he imagined that he had just done a highly patriotic deed, justified by the official misconduct of the man he had shot.\u00a0 Over and over again he exclaimed the words <i>\"Justicia! Justicia!\"<\/i>(Justice), declaring that what he had done had been done for Justicia, and that he had no wish or desire to make his escape; in a loud voice he cried:\u00a0 \"Down with the tyrant!\" (<i>abajo con el tirano<\/i>!), and declaimed incoherently on the duties of a patriot; and finally, as he went downstairs under arrest, he called to those around him:\u00a0 \"Let us see if any of you will follow in my footsteps! (<i>A ver si algunos de ustedes vienen en pos de mi!<\/i>)\u00a0 Such language, used at such a time and under such circumstances, would seem to be the ravings of a man who had keyed himself to the commission of a desperate act by brooding on some real or fancied political wrong rather than the cries of one who had just slain his enemy in a sudden quarrel precipitated by unexpected and unprovoked insults.<br\/><br\/>Other than the testimony of the accused himself, no evidence appears of record which in our opinion tends in anywise to cast a doubt upon the truth and certainty of the findings hereinbefore set out, except only the testimony of the witnesses who swore that on the morning in question, the accused, upon entering the government building, bore himself so as not to give rise to suspicion of anything exceptional or extraordinary in his conduct, and that in conversing with the clerks in the governor's anteroom he indicated some indisposition to go in person to the office of the governor to ask for the license for which he said he had come.\u00a0 We think, however, that, granting that the conduct of the accused was as calm and collected as it was described by the witnesses and that he indicated an apparent unwillingness to approach the governor in person, this conduct, in the light of the other evidence of record, must be taken to be the result of an effort to live up to the requirement of his preconceived plan to gain admission to the office of his known enemy on the pretense of seeking a license for his revolver.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for appellant lays great stress on the testimony of the witness who stated that he heard the deceased make use of the word <i>infeliz<\/i> just before the shooting took place, and the testimony of one of the counsel for the defense, who testified that soon after the shooting, while the accused was yet wild with excitement, the witness caught him by the arm and shook him to bring him to his senses, where-upon the accused exclaimed:\u00a0 \"He called me an <i>infeliz<\/i>!\"-\"Who am I that I should be called an <i>infeliz<\/i> by a governor?\"\u00a0 In our opinion, however, this evidence in no way weakens the force of the case made out by the prosecution; and indeed the evidence of the witness who testified that he heard the word <i>infeliz<\/i> used before the shooting, if it is true tends rather to contradict the story of the accused in one of its most essential details, and to confirm the theory of the prosecution as to the manner in which the shooting took place.\u00a0\u00a0 This witness testified as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"I heard the governor's voice in a somewhat altered tone.\u00a0 * * *\u00a0 After a few moments I heard a word, among other words<i> infeliz<\/i>, and almost in the same act I heard a movement of a chair as if someone were getting up, and at the same moment I heard shots and that was when we began to run.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>As we have stated heretofore, this evidence by no means corroborates the testimony of the accused as to the alleged <i>series<\/i> of insults Reaped upon him by the deceased; and indeed when it is remembered that the accused testified that the exclamation <i>hijo de puta<\/i> immediately followed the use of the word <i>infeliz<\/i>, the fact that this witness for the defense heard the word infeliz, and yet did not hear the words <i>hijo de puta<\/i>, a phrase which could not fail to strike the ear of one who heard the word <i>infeliz<\/i> if both were in fact used, strongly corroborates the other evidence of record which tends to prove that the deceased did not make use of the phrase <i>hijo de puta<\/i>; and so far as the apparently self-serving statement of the accused made soon after the shooting, which was introduced by the defense, was admissible at all, it tends to further corroborate this conclusion, for the reference to the use of the word <i>infeliz<\/i> and the failure to refer to the really grave insult at such a time, strongly suggests that the addition of the latter to the language put in the mouth of the deceased by the accused, was an afterthought falsely injected to give an appearance of truth to his story of a sudden outburst of uncontrollable passion.<br\/><br\/>It will be observed also that the witness for the defense testified that \"almost at the same moment\" as he heard the word <i>infeliz<\/i> he heard \"a movement of a chair as if some one were getting up,\" and <i>\"at the same moment\"<\/i> he heard shots.\u00a0 This testimony fully corroborates the circumstantial evidence introduced by the prosecution, which tends to prove that at least one shot was fired while the deceased was sitting in or rather in the act of rising from his chair, and clearly contradicts the statement of the accused, that all the shots were fired during a struggle with the deceased, after the latter had attempted to take possession of the revolver.<br\/><br\/>It well might be that Governor Lopez, looking up from his desk where he was engaged in the transaction of public business and wholly unarmed, and suddenly discovering his deadly enemy leveling a pistol at his head, should have exclaimed <i>infeliz<\/i> (\"miserable creature,\" or as translated by counsel for the defense, \"coward\") as he leaped to his feet, but proof that he did make use of this particular word, without the additional phrase mentioned by the accused, \"almost in the same moment\" as the shot was fired, in no wise supports the story told by the accused, nor does it explain, nor justify, nor excuse his murderous assault.<br\/><br\/>In the light of all the evidence of record, the substance of which is hereinbefore set out, we are satisfied that it is not true, as claimed by the accused, that having gone to the office of the governor merely for the purpose of seeking a license for his revolver, he made use of the revolver in a sudden burst of passion aroused by the unprovoked insults heaped upon him on that occasion; and we are of opinion that the evidence sustains a finding that his real purpose in going to the government building on the morning in question was to take the life of his enemy; that the plan so to do originated in his mind not later than the night before the morning on which the shooting took place; that that plan was persisted in from the early hour at which he left his house until the time when he gained admission to the office of the governor, a pefiod of time long enough to justify us in holding that the crime was committed with deliberate premeditation (<i>premeditacion conocida<\/i>), because, in a judicial sense, it afforded full opportunity for meditation and reflection, and was amply sufficient to allow his conscience to overcome the resolution of his will (<i>vencer las determinaciones de la voluntad<\/i>) had he desired to hearken to its warnings; this being the measure of the period of tjme necessary to justify the inference of deliberate premeditation, as laid down in the case of the United States <i>vs.<\/i> Ricafor (1 Phil. Rep., 173), adopting the rule laid down by the supreme court of Spain in its <i>sentencia<\/i> dated November 10,1894.<br\/><br\/>We are satisfied, too, that the crime was committed with treachery (<i>alevosia<\/i>), because the evidence of record leaves no room for doubt that, actuated by the hatred engendered by his personal and political quarrel with his enemy, he sought his enemy alone in his office, and upon securing admission opened fire upon his victim, who was at the moment engaged in the transaction of public business and wholly unarmed, without giving him an opportunity to resist or to defend himself.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the defense urges that the trial court erred in admitting the dying declaration of the deceased governor, on the ground that its admission was in violation of the inalienable right of the accused to be confronted by the witnesses against him, guaranteed by the provisions of section 5 of the Philippine Bill and by the provisions of paragraph 5 [of section 15] of General Orders, No. 58.\u00a0 It must not be forgotten, however, that the guaranties extended by Congress to the people of the Philippine Islands are to be interpreted as meaning what the like provisions meant when Congress made them applicable to these Islands (Serra <i>vs.<\/i> Mortiga, 204 U. S., 470; also reported in 11 Phil. Rep., 762).\u00a0 And in the United States, the constitutional clause providing for the confrontation by the accused with the witnesses for the prosecution, purported merely to adopt the general principle of the hearsay rule, and to secure to the accused the right to cross-examine the infrajudicial witnesses against him, and did not purport to enumerate all of the exceptions and limitations to that principle:<br\/><blockquote>\"There were (at the time of the adoption of the Constitution of the United States), a number of well-established exceptions, and there might be others in the future; the Constitution indorsed the general principle (of the hearsay rule), subject to these exceptions; merely naming and describing it sufficiently to indicate the principle intended-just as the brief constitutional sanction for trial by jury did not attempt to enumerate (all) the classes of cases to which that form of trial was appropriate nor the precise procedure involved in it, and has always been construed as not absolute and universal in effect, but as subject to the limitations and unessential variations understood to ac- company that institution.\"\u00a0 (Greenleaf on Evidence, Sixteenth Edition, Vol. 1, par. 163 and p. 283; Campbell <i>vs.<\/i> State, 11 Georgia, 374; State <i>vs.<\/i> McO'Blenis, 24 Mo., 416; Robertson <i>vs.<\/i> Baldwin, U. S., 17 Sup. 326.)<br\/><\/blockquote>The American authors of the Philippine Bill and of General Orders, No. 58, must be presumed to have borrowed the provisions of the Constitution of the United States securing to accused persons the right of confrontation and cross-examination of the witnesses against them, subject to the well-established exceptions which have always been recognized under the rule as laid down by the Constitution of the United States, and it is clear that these provisions were not intended to render inadmissible dying declarations in criminal cases touching the circumstances leading up to the death for which the prosecution is instituted, for such declarations have always been regarded as an exception to the general rule rejecting hearsay evidence, on the general principle, as laid down by Lord Baron Eyre, \"That they are declarations made in extremity, when the party is at the point of death, and when every hope of this world is gone; when every motive to falsehood is silenced and the mind is induced by the most powerful considerations to speak the truth.\u00a0 A situation so solemn and so awful as to be considered by the law as creating an obligation equal to that which is imposed by a positive oath in a court of justice.\"\u00a0 The rule is the same as the rule of the Roman Civil Law, <i>\"Morti proximum, sive moribundum, non praesumendum est mentiri, nec esse immemorem saluties aeternae; licet non praesumatur semper dicere verum.\"<\/i>\u00a0 (Mascard, De Probat. Concl., 1080; U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Montes, 6 Phil. Rep., 443.)<br\/><br\/>It has been suggested, however, that since a specific exception is found in General Orders, No. 58, to the rule touching the confrontation of witnesses, as therein laid down, the expression of this exception should be taken to exclude all other exceptions. The exception relied upon is as follows :<br\/><blockquote>\"Where the testimony of a witness for the prosecution has previously been taken down by question and answer, in the presence of the accused or his counsel, the defense having had ah opportunity to cross-examine the witness, the deposition of the latter may be read, upon satisfactory proof to the court that he is dead or insane, or can not with due diligence be found in the Islands.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It is very clear, however, that this express provision for an exception to the general rule, which has not been universally recognized in those jurisdictions where it has not been provided for by express legislation, can by no means be regarded as intended to exclude the various general exceptions to the hearsay rule which have always been recognized despite the existence of constitutional provisions securing the rights of accused persons to be confronted by, and to cross-examine the witnesses for the prosecution.<br\/><br\/>That the declarant was conscious of his impending death, and that he spoke with the prospect of \"almost immediate dissolution\" confronting him; that he understood the meaning and effect of his statements; and that he knew he was addressing the law officers of the town and province wherein he lived, and informing them as to the circumstances which led up to his death, are facts which we think are sufficiently established by the evidence of record:\u00a0 and the admissibility of the dying declaration, resting, as it does, exclusively on the ground that the declarant was \"in extremis\" at the time it was made, is in nowise affected by the failure of the law officers to secure the more formal and detailed statement contemplated in the above-cited provision of General Orders, No. 58, which they might perhaps have been able to obtain had they not been misled by the opinion of the attending surgeons that the wounded man would probably recover.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for appellant also insist that the evidence of Captain Gearhardt and Captain Lewis as to the probable trajectory of the bullet, which was found in the wall of the office, was inadmissible, on the ground that these witnesses did not properly qualify as experts; and comment at considerable length on the worthless character of the testimony of experts as rendered in judicial investigations generally.\u00a0 We agree with counsel that the admission of this class of testimony, partly because of the want of satisfactory standards of expertness, partly because of its too frequently conflicting and unreliable character, and partly because of its tendency to prolong trials and increase the expense incident thereto, leads to abuses which renders its value as an aid to investigation of truth in courts of justice exceedingly doubtful and problematical.\u00a0 And yet the need for such testimony appears to have justified its continued use, and we can not say that it does not in some cases serve a useful purpose, when its inherent weakness and danger of abuse are kept constantly in mind.<br\/><br\/>An expert has been defined to be one possessing, in regard to a particular subject or department of human activity, knowledge not usually acquired by other persons (12 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. Law, 2d Ed., 424); and under this definition we think that Captain Gearhardt and perhaps Captain Lewis may fairly be classed as experts, as to questions touching the course and effect of bullets shot from small arms at moderate ranges, their long experience in the use of such arms, with the professional obligation imposed upon them to study and familiarize themselves with their use and manipulation as the tools of their trade, having, presumably, given to them a knowledge in such matters not usually acquired by civilians.\u00a0 It is true that the frank admissions by these witnesses of their inability to solve a number of hypothetical problems of a technical nature in the science of ballistics (problems which in the present status of human knowledge on that subject may or may not be capable of satisfactory solution) would indicate that, unlike many more pretentious expert witnesses, there are limitations to the extent of the knowledge they claim to possess; but we think that, under the principles laid down in the following extract from Greenleaf, their capacity as expert witnesses to answer the questions propounded to them as to the probable trajectory of the bullet found in the wall of the office was not affected by such confessed limitations to the extent of their knowledge and to their capacity to answer every question propounded to them by opposing counsel:<br\/><blockquote>\"It follows that there are no fixed Classes of expert persons, in one of which a witness finds himself and1 remains permanently.\u00a0 A person may be sufficiently skilled for one question, and totally unqualified for the next.\u00a0 He may be competent to say whether the deceased had gray hair, and incompetent to say what killed him; competent to say whether the deceased was asphyxiated by gas, and incompetent to distinguish between coal gas and water gas; competent to say whether a hatchet was sharp, and incompetent to tell whether a stain upon it was of human blood.\u00a0 The witness may from question to question enter or leave the class of persons fitted to answer.\u00a0 It is desirable to appreciate that expert capacity is a matter wholly relative to the subject of the particular question; that therefore the existence of the capacity arises in theory as a new inquiry from question to question; and that a particular person is not to be thought of as objectively or absolutely an expert, in the sense that he is absolutely a German or a negro or six feet high.\"\u00a0 (Greenleaf on Evidence, 1st vol., 16th ed., par. 430 (a), p. 523.)<br\/><\/blockquote>But whatever may be the value which should be given to the expert opinions expressed by these witnesses, and even were we to disregard these opinions altogether, the trajectory of the bullet to which they testified must be taken to have been established to the satisfaction of the trial judge and to ours (so far as it was proper for him to rely upon his own opinion based on the facts proven, rather than on the opinion of expert witnesses) by the ocular examination of the scene of the tragedy made by him at the request of counsel for defense, the facts upon which the experts based their opinions having been submitted to him on that occasion in such manner as to afford him full opportunity to draw his own conclusions without regard to the opinion of the witnesses.<br\/><br\/>On appeal, as well as in the court below, the conduct of Captain Lewis, and the trustworthiness of his testimony, have been attacked with no little severity, but commenting on these criticisms the trial judge in his decision observes that \"Captain Lewis as senior inspector of Constabulary has simply performed his official duty as far as his action has been apparent to this court, and he has merited commendation instead of blame for the faithful performance of his official duty;\" and while we agree with counsel for the appellant that Captain Lewis's official position having imposed upon him the duty of securing testimony and otherwise aiding the prosecution, a due regard for the frailties of human nature imposes on us the obligation of scrutinizing his testimony with the utmost care, lest by any chance his interest as a prosecutor might have biased his feelings as a disinterested witness; and while we recognize that, under the circumstances, too much reliance should not be placed on his opinions or his recollection of facts as to which mistake or misunderstanding might lead him astray; nevertheless we find nothing in the record which would justify us in believing that there is any reason to doubt his honesty of intention or the truth or accuracy of his testimony as to facts which mere bias on his part would not be likely to distort.<br\/><br\/>It appearing from the evidence of record that the accused was guilty, as charged, of unlawfully taking the life of Benito Lopez, and that the crime was committed with treachery (<i>alevosia<\/i>) and with deliberate premeditation (<i>premeditacion conocida<\/i>), and that his victim was engaged in the performance of the functions of his office, as governor of the Province of Iloilo, at the time when the crime was committed, and the commission of the crime not being marked by any extenuating circumstance, the accused was properly convicted of the crime of assassination, and the penalty prescribed by law was properly imposed in its maximum degree.\u00a0 The sentence of death imposed by the trial court should, therefore, be, and is hereby, affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano C.

E., 3.)<br\/><br\/>Subsequently, however, the attorneys for the plaintiff and the defendant, Geronimo Jose, agreed in behalf of their clients \"that the special defense put forward by defendant Geronimo Jose be withdrawn and in lieu thereof said defendant accepts each and all of the facts stated in the complaint, as drawn; they further agree\u00a0 to submit the question of law to the court after the filing of written argument by both parties.\"\u00a0 (B. E., 4.)<br\/><br\/>The Court of First Instance of the city of Manila rendered judgment on the 25th of April, 1907, sentencing Geronimo Jose to pay to the plaintiff, the Banco Espa\u00f1ol-Filipino, the sum of P3,775.50, Philippine currency, the equivalent of $3,600, Mexican currency, the amount of the obligation contained in the promissory note of July 21, 1902, together with the legal interest thereon at the rate of 6 per cent per annum from the 22d of October of said year, when the; obligation became due, until its full payment, and P6.95 for charges on the protest of said note, and costs.<br\/><br\/>The defendant excepted to the above judgment, and by means of a bill of exceptions appealed to this court claiming that the court below erred;<br\/><blockquote>\"I.\u00a0 In holding that the promissory note, which is the subject of this controversy, arose from mercantile transactions.<br\/><br\/>\"II.\u00a0 In entering judgment against the defendant Geronimo Jose, and compelling him to pay the plaintiff, the Banco Espa\u00f1ol-Filipino, the sum of P3,775.50, Philippine currency.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In connection with the first error assigned, the appellant's brief\u00a0 reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"The promissory note, as it stands, is the only document by, and the only evidence from which the conclusion that it is the result of commercial operations must be drawn.\u00a0 In the whole wording of the note we do not find a clear expression that it originated from mercantile transactions, nor do we find an expression determining that a previous mercantile transaction existed between the interested parties; but on the contrary, we find that it contains the words 'value received in cash for commercial transactions.'\u00a0 The foregoing words 'value received in cash for commercial transactions,' leave no room for any doubt whatever, and the actual significance and literal meaning of each of them lead us to understand that the money was to be used strictly for commercial operations, an act which is subsequent to the execution of the promissory note, while the Code of Commerce requires exactly the contrary in order that a note may be considered as a commercial document; that is to say, that the commercial act shall precede the execution of the note.\u00a0 Therefore, the foregoing words in their true meaning neither establish the fact nor permit the presumption of a commercial transaction prior to the date of the<br\/>note.\"\u00a0 (Brief,\u00a0 4 and 5.)<br\/><\/blockquote>The second assignment of error is based on the supposition that the note in question is not a commercial document; that the original contract between Tan-Tongco and Jose was either an ordinary loan or a mercantile promise to pay; and that in either case, whether an ordinary loan, or a mercantile promise to pay, it was not legally indorsable, but simply a transmission of ownership whereby the defendant, Geronimo Jose, incurred no liability for payment, he being only responsible for the authenticity of the document and the legitimacy of the credit, or at most, for the previous and public insolvency of the debtor.\u00a0 (Art. 1529, Civil Code, and art. 548, Code of Commerce.)<br\/><br\/>Hence, the conclusions of the appeal are:<br\/><br\/>That the promissory note in question, in the form in which it was drawn up, is not a commercial note.<br\/><br\/>That not being such, it can not legally be indorsed.<br\/><br\/>That, not being legally indorsable, the indorsement there on is simply an assignment of credit.<br\/><br\/>That an assignment of credit does not produce the obligation to pay, and that in consequence thereof, the indorser, Geronimo Jose, should be absolved of the complaint.<br\/><br\/>The form of the note in controversy was, and still is, that habitually used between merchants, and it may be stated, as a notoriously public fact, that printed promissory notes with the corresponding stamp affixed thereon and in the identical language of the one in question, were sold at the offices maintained by the Spanish Government for the sale of stamped articles.<br\/><br\/>In the judgment in cassation\u00a0 rendered by the supreme court of Spain on the 21st of April, 1888, the following case appears:<br\/><blockquote>\"In a private document dated Barcelona 8th of June, 1883, D. Jose Altimira declared that he owed\u00a0 and would pay on the 7th day of September next, to Messrs. E. Vilumara &amp; Co., or to their order, the sum of 40,000 pesetas which he had received in cash.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The wording is identical with the note at bar:\u00a0 \"Three months from\u00a0 date, I promise to pay to order, for a determined amount received in cash,\" that is to say, with a statement of the origin and value; it lacks the specific statement \"of article 311 of the Code of Commerce \"for commercial transactions,\" which is found on the\u00a0 one at bar.<br\/><blockquote>\"On the following day, the 9th of June, the said note was indorsed to the order of Messrs. Sado, Borras, Nolla &amp; Co., for value received from them, and on being presented at maturity, was protested for nonpayment on the 10th of September, the maker stating that he would pay it as soon as possible.\u00a0 At the second summons served on him for acknowledgment of the signature on the note, he denied the existence of the debt (whereby proceedings in distraint were barred), and in consequence thereof Sado, Borras, Nolla &amp; Co. filed an ordinary complaint.\u00a0 When answering the complaint, Altimira denied being a merchant, and as special defense he offered the plea of <i>sine actione agis, non numerata pecunia, sine causa<\/i>, etc., claimed that the note was null and void, and insisted that it did not refer to any mercantile transaction, but at the trial he acknowledged his signature thereon.\u00a0 The <i>Audiencia<\/i> of Barcelona sentenced Altimira to pay the amount of the promissory note with legal interest from the date of\u00a0 the protest, together with the charges thereon, and costs.<br\/><br\/>\"Altimira interposed an appeal in cassation, claiming violation of:<br\/><br\/>\"1.\u00a0 Article 558 of the old Code of Commerce, which was in force at the date of the document, in that it provided that only such promissory notes as arise from commercial transactions shall produce the same effects and obligations as a bill of exchange; and, inasmuch as in the suit no mercantile operation had been mentioned or shown from which note in question might have originated, the same could not be considered as a mercantile document, nor could the provisions governing a bill of exchange or others of the Code of Commerce be made applicable thereto.<br\/><br\/>\"2.\u00a0 Laws 1 and 2, title 14, partida 3, and the previous decisions of said supreme court which hold that the burden of proof is upon the plaintiff, and not upon the defendant who denies having received the amount.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The supreme court dismissed the appeal \"since the judgment appealed from was not in violation of article 558 of the Code of Commerce of 1829, nor of laws 1 and 2, title 14, partida 3, cited in the first and second assignments of error, because the decision of the <i>Sala<\/i> sentencing D. Jose Altimira to pay the 40,000 pesetas with interest from the time when the protest was made, was in conformity with the said laws, inasmuch as the note signed by Altimira in favor of Sres. Vilumara &amp; Co. and to their order, acknowledged, as it has been, by judicial and extra judicial acts, is a mercantile document both by reason of its <i>wording<\/i> and on account of the personal qualifications of the parties who executed it, and in this sense it proves to be a valid obligation,\u00a0 notwithstanding the plea of 'money not delivered as alleged by Altimira, which is not admitted by the commercial law, and against\u00a0 which there is also the evidence furnished by the plaintiff.\"<br\/><br\/>The promissory note of Altimira contained no indication that the amount therein admitted arose from commercial transactions, nor was such use or employment expressed by the words \"for commercial transactions,\" and\u00a0 yet, it was held as a point of doctrine that, owing to its <i>wording<\/i>, it was a mercantile document.<br\/><br\/>In another judgment in cassation rendered on the 12th of December, 1889, the following case was dealt with:\u00a0 On the 7th of January, 1886, Jose Xiro y Jorda signed a promissory note to the order of Gaspar Casellas, payable on the 31st of the following March, for the sum of 7,000 pesetas in gold or silver currency, for value received from Casellas on said date to meet commercial operations of the signer, which note, after being indorsed by Casellas to the order of Francisco Hospital, was protested when it became due, for<br\/>lack of payment.<br\/><br\/>A complaint being presented, the Court of First Instance entered a judgment which was affirmed by the <i>Audiencia<\/i> of Barcelona, sentencing Jose Xiro y Jorda to pay the 7,000 pesetas together with\u00a0 interest thereon, charges, and costs.<br\/><br\/>Xiro y Jorda interposed an appeal in cassation setting forth:\u00a0 (1) The violation of the axiom that the Code of Commerce is not applicable in controversies between those who are not merchants or perform acts of commerce, and in applying its provisions to the case at bar, in spite of the fact that\u00a0 the contracting parties were not merchants, and that the note arose from no mercantile transaction whatever.\u00a0 (2) The improper application, for the same reason, of articles 531, 532, 503, 526, and 57 of the Code of Commerce, on which the judgment appealed from is based.\u00a0 (3) That in the doctrine set up by this supreme court in its decisions of November 7, 1870, July 8, 1872, and others, according to which, in\u00a0 order that promissory notes made out to order may produce the same effects and obligations as bills of exchange, it is necessary that they shall arise from mercantile operations, a fact which does not appear in the case at bar.\u00a0 (4) That for similar reasons article 532 of the Code of Commerce, which provides that notes made out to order shall produce the same obligations and effects as bills of exchange, provided that they arise from commercial operations, had been infringed (5).\u00a0 That article 311 of the Code of Commerce provides that, where a loan is to be reputed as a mercantile transaction, some one of the contracting parties must be a merchant, or that the things loaned must be devoted to acts of commerce, neither of which circumstances was present in the note in question, as neither was the petitioner a merchant, nor has it been proven that any mercantile operation whatever had been carried out with the amount loaned.<br\/><br\/>The supreme court dismissed the appeal and established the following doctrine:<br\/><blockquote>\"That it is not true that the Code of Commerce is not applicable to those who are not merchants, because, according to article 2, all acts of commerce shall be governed by its provisions, whether the parties executing them are merchants or not.<br\/><br\/>\"That as the trial court, in the use of its exclusive powers, had held that the note in question was authentic, valid, and of a mercantile character, the first assignment of error, as well as the second, third, fourth, and fifth, wherein contrary affirmations are discussed, are incompetent and immaterial.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The appeal which is now before this court concerns the question of liability on the part of the indorser of a promissory note.\u00a0 The attorney for the defendant indorser of the note herein, denies the mercantile character of the note indorsed by the\u00a0 latter, and contends that said indorsement can have no other effect than that of a cession under the common law, and not such as is attached to it by the commercial law.\u00a0 And as a denial of the mercantile character of the note, he cites articles 532 of the Code of Commerce which reads: <br\/><blockquote>\"ART.\u00a0 532.\u00a0 Drafts payable to order between merchants and the bills or promissory notes likewise payable to order, which arise from commercial transactions, shall produce the same obligations and effects as bills of exchange, except with regard to acceptance, which is a quality of the latter only.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>We consider the following as powerful reasons for doubt:\u00a0 (1) That there is no evidence that either Tan-Tongco, the drawer, or Geronimo Jose, the indorser, were\u00a0 merchants; (2) that no evidence whatever was offered to prove that the note arose from commercial transactions; (3) the decisions of the supreme court of Spain of April 10 and November 24, 1894.<br\/><br\/>The majority however, base their decision on the following grounds:<br\/><br\/>With regard to the first point, that, in accordance with article 532 of\u00a0 the Code of Commerce, in order that drafts payable to order may produce the same obligations and effects as bills of exchange, it is necessary that they shall exist between\u00a0 merchants; but this is not so in the case of <i>vales<\/i> and promissory notes payable to order; it is sufficient if these latter arise from commercial transactions.<br\/><br\/>With respect to obligations and effects produced thereby, the law has sought to put drafts and promissory notes, payable to order, and each with its necessary requisite, on the same footing with bills of exchange:\u00a0 drafts to order, being \"between merchants,\" and\u00a0 promissory notes to order those \"that arise from commercial transactions.\"\u00a0 If the requisite of being \"between merchants\" had been required for both, the article would have read differently or have been couched in other terms, whereas it is quite clear in its language and exact in the idea that it seeks to convey, concerning the principles governing the matter.<br\/><br\/>According to the language of article 532, which states that \"drafts payable to order between merchants, and bills or promissory notes, likewise payable to order, which arise from commercial transactions, shall produce the same obligations and effects as bills of exchange, except with regard to acceptance, which is a quality of the latter only,\" it would seem (1) that drafts payable to order between parties who are not merchants have not a mercantile character; (2) that a promissory note made payable to order, even though it were made by a person who is not a merchant, provided it arose from commercial transactions, has the character of a mercantile document.<br\/><br\/>On the second point, the majority holds that it is not necessary to show, either judicially or extra judicially, that the note herein arose from commercial transactions; it need not be shown judicially, because the defendant has riot offered any denial in his answer to the complaint.\u00a0 On the contrary, the parties have submitted the document, as executed, to the courts for a decision as to whether, in accordance with the law, it is a mercantile document or not.\u00a0 It need\u00a0 not be shown extra judicially, because\u00a0 it would be absolutely contrary to the idea of mercantile transactions and to the nature of contracts and commercial legislation, that a bank, every time a promissory note was presented, drawn in terms similar to those of the one at bar, should require the\u00a0 drawer and the indorser to produce books and<br\/>other evidence to establish the fact, and to show\u00a0 that the note arose from commercial transactions as, for example, from the dissolution of a commercial copartnership, from a current account,\u00a0 from the balancing of accounts of a commission agent, from the liability resulting from a commercial deposit, etc., and to make sure of all these proofs against the contingency of a litigation.<br\/><br\/>Beyond the fact that the question set up is purely one of law, and as both parties agree to the facts contained in the document, the point to be decided is whether or not a promissory note payable to order for a certain sum received in cash for commercial transactions, as it is worded, is a mercantile document.<br\/><br\/>As to the third point, the decisions cited of the supreme court of Spain, its doctrine is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"It is not sufficient that a <i>vale<\/i> or promissory note, in order to be juridically valued as a commercial document, contain the conditions stated in article 571 of the Code of Commerce; it must, in addition, arise from commercial transactions as required by article 558 (of the code of 1829), and there is nothing whatever about the note in question to show that said essential requirement of the law had been fulfilled, because it is only\u00a0 stated therein that the borrower received the 5,000 pesetas for a business matter, and said isolated statement neither proves that the loan <i>arose<\/i> from a commercial transaction, as the law requires, nor can it possess legal value so long as the truth of the fact contained in said statement remains unproven, namely, that the borrower used the 5,000 pesetas for commercial purposes.\"\u00a0 (Decision of April 10, 1894.)<br\/><\/blockquote>Again, in a decision of November 24, 1894, which, by the way, referred to one rendered by the late <i>Audiencia Territorial de Manila<\/i>, it is held:<br\/><blockquote>\"That those <i>vales<\/i> and promissory notes made payable to order; which, by the provisions of article 532 of the Code of Commerce are of the same validity and effect as bills of exchange, are not those the value of which is to be devoted to commercial transactions,\u00a0 but those which arise from transactions of this kind.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In addition to the above-cited decisions, there might also have been cited those of August 5, 1857, January 29, and June 28, 1859, November 7, 1870, July 8, 1872, May 28 and July 4, 1884, but that of November 25, 1898, which is cited in the judgment appealed from, appears to be more positive.\u00a0 It reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"The commercial character of promissory notes made payable to order is not determined by the mere fact that the persons therein interested as maker, iridorser, or holder are merchants, but by the special circumstance that the said notes arose from commercial\u00a0 transactions, as expressly provided by article 558 of the code of 1829, applicable to the case under appeal, and in accordance with the doctrine established by this supreme court in its decision of January 29, 1859, and June 20, of the same year, the first of which was expressly and specially based on the consideration that the note in question contained no indication from which it might be understood that it arose from a commercial transaction, and because nothing of that nature resulted therefrom.\"\u00a0 (Decision of the 29th of January, 1859, cited above.)<br\/><\/blockquote>The matter at issue was a promissory note made by Manuel Docavo on the 27th of March, 1855, and payable three months from date to the\u00a0 order of Boom, for 240,000 reales in cash, indorsed by Boom on the 29th of May following to the Bank of Cadiz, for value received, and finally indorsed by the bank on the 1st of July, 1867, to Andres Terry.<br\/><br\/>It was protested on the 28th of June, 1855, and Docavo made the statement that the firm did not pay the said promissory note on account of lack of funds.\u00a0 (Par. 3 of the judgment.)<br\/><br\/>An action\u00a0 was\u00a0 brought before the\u00a0 ordinary court of justice, but the <i>Tribunal de Comercio<\/i> claimed jurisdiction in the matter in view of the fact that it involved a commercial note signed and indorsed by merchants, in accordance with articles 434 and 558 of the Code of Commerce of 1829.<br\/><br\/>The jurisdiction having been decided in favor of the ordinary court, an appeal in cassation was taken, and among other reasons the following were alleged:<br\/><br\/>That, even though the origin of the note had not been a commercial transaction, inasmuch as it had been indorsed, it was a commercial sale so qualified by the provisions of section 1, title 3, book 2 of said Code of Commerce, and subject to the articles that deal with indorsements of bills of exchange, applicable to the indorsement on promissory notes, in accordance with the above-cited article 558.\u00a0 For said reasons the decision in the judgment was contrary to the said articles and to article 1199; and that it was also contrary to article 434, because the merchant Boom had indorsed the note, and, according to said article, an indorsement by a merchant on a bill which did not arise from a mercantile operation was considered a commercial transaction.<br\/><br\/>The supreme court held:<br\/><blockquote>\"1.\u00a0 That the note in question contained no<i> indication<\/i> whatever from which it might appear that it arose from a commercial transaction, 'because it is only stated therein that it is payable to order for 240,000 <i>reales vellon<\/i> received in cash, and payable at three months from the date thereof\/<br\/><br\/>\"2.\u00a0 That article 387 of the Code of Commerce provides that, in order that loans may be considered as commercial transactions, it is necessary that they be contracted with the understanding and <i>upon the agreement that the things borrowed shall be devoted to commercial purposes<\/i>, and not to liabilities foreign thereto, and that, in the absence of said condition, they shall be considered as ordinary loans and governed by the common laws.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>From\u00a0 the whole of this doctrine it would seem that the promissory\u00a0 note in question did not contain the form of article 387, to wit:\u00a0 \"for commercial transactions;\" that with said statement the note would have appeared as a commercial loan; and that, being a commercial document, it would have then contained the necessary <i>indication<\/i> that it arose from commercial transactions.\u00a0 This is the important part of the decision:\u00a0 that a note arises from a commercial transaction if it is the outcome of a commercial loan, and the loan is a commercial one when the things loaned are for commercial operations or transactions.<br\/><br\/>Another decision dated June\u00a0 28, 1859, referred to a promissory note made out as follows:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"I hereby promise to pay on the 1st of October next to the order of Don Fernando Arevalo Miera, the sum of 50,000 <i>reales vellon<\/i> in silver or gold currency, for value of wheat which I purchased and received from\u00a0 him.-Valladolid, August 30, 1856.-Antolin\u00a0 Carrion.-I hereby guarantee the payment of this promissory note.-Valladolid, August 31, 1856.\u00a0 Jose Suarez Centi.\"<br\/><br\/><\/blockquote>An analogous question of jurisdiction arose, and, as the higher tribunal found against the <i>Tribunal de Comercio<\/i>, an appeal in cassation was interposed alleging that articles 359, 558, 563, 570, 2d, 1178, 1199, and 1200 of the Code of Commerce had been violated.<br\/><br\/>But the supreme court held:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"1.\u00a0 That the sale of wheat or crops from the harvest of the seller or other farmers whom the latter may represent, and to whom\u00a0 he may bind himself to make payment by means of a promissory\u00a0 note, can not be considered as a commercial transaction.<br\/><br\/>\"2.\u00a0 That promissory notes and guaranties must be viewed according to the nature of the obligations which they were intended to guarantee and secure at the time when they were drawn up, and must remain subject to the rules that determine the nature of the obligations themselves.<br\/><br\/>\"3.\u00a0 That in order that <i>vales<\/i> and promissory notes payable to order shall produce the same obligations as bills of exchange, it is necessary, under article 558 of the Code of Commerce, that they arise from commercial transactions; and that, in order that the guaranties may be considered as pertaining to this class, article 412 requires not only that the principal contracting parties shall be merchants, but also that the security shall be for the fulfillment of a commercial transaction.\"<br\/><br\/><\/blockquote>In\u00a0 the decisions of 1859 in the matter of jurisdiction, cited in\u00a0 the judgment in cassation rendered on the 25th of November, 1898, the doctrine laid down is in line with the provisions of articles 558\u00a0 of the Code of Commerce of 1829, and 532 of that of 1855, now in force in the Philippines; none of the promissory notes in litigation, which were the subject of appeal in the judgments cited above, contained the phrase \"for commercial transactions\" which is, according to the decision of January 29, 1859, the indication that a promissory note arises from a commercial transaction, that is to say, from a commercial loan.<br\/><br\/>In the decision of November 24, 1894, rendered in the appeal in cassation interposed by Gamero in a suit with Cajigas, forwarded from the <i>Audiencia Territorial de Manila<\/i>, it was expressly stated that securities and promissory notes payable to order, to which article 532 grants the same validity and effects as bills of exchange, are not those the amount of which will be devoted to commercial transactions, but those which <i>arise from transactions<\/i> of this kind.\u00a0 In some of the renewals of the original promissory note executed by Narciso Paterno to the order of Gamero, and indorsed by the latter to the order of Cajigas, the words <i>for commercial purposes<\/i>, which the original one did not contain, were deliberately put in, but it was proven that the same was a simple note and had nothing whatever to do with a commercial transaction.<br\/><br\/>Thus far only does the doctrine repeatedly established by the supreme court of Spain extend, notwithstanding the fact that in its decision of January 29, 1859, it clearly indicates how the legal requirements of article 532 are considered as fulfilled so that a promissory note payable to order may produce the same effects and obligations as a bill of exchange, that is, when it contains a sufficient statement or indication from which it may appear that the same arose from a mercantile operation, such being the case when it contains the words for <i>commercial transactions<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>One of the effects of a bill of exchange is the indorsement whereby the ownership thereof is transferred to another (art. 461).\u00a0 And it establishes on the part of the indorser the obligation to answer for the value of the bill, if not paid at maturity (art. 467).\u00a0 According to the same article 532, an indorsement on a promissory note made payable to order arising from a commercial transaction entails the same obligation.<br\/><br\/>If the defendant herein indorsed a promissory note of a really commercial nature, payable to order, he is obliged to meet the value of the note in question where the same was not paid at maturity, as provided by the said article 467.<br\/><br\/>That the note is payable to order, is beyond all question.\u00a0 The matter under discussion is whether or not, under the law, it is a commercial note.<br\/><br\/>According to article\u00a0 531 a promissory note payable to order must contain (1) the specific name of the promissory note; (2) the date of issue; (3) the amount; (4) the time of payment; (5) the person to whose order the payment is to be made; (6) the place where the payment is to be made; (7) the origin and kind of value it represents; (8) the signature of the person who contracts the obligation to pay the same.\u00a0 And the note at bar unquestionably contains all of said requisites.<br\/><br\/>The seventh of the above conditions is the same as appears in paragraph 5 of article 444 for bills of exchange:<br\/><blockquote>\"5. The form in which the consideration is acknowledged, either on account of the receipt of its value in cash, or merchandise, or other property, which shall be expressed with the words Value received,' or accepting it on those which may be pending, which shall be indicated by the words 'value on account' or 'value understood.'\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Contracts which serve as a necessary precedent for the issue of a bill of exchange can never be mistaken for the bill itself, the consequences and effects of which are entirely distinct from the contract or contracts which gave rise to the\u00a0 same.\u00a0 (Lorenzo Benito, Lessons on Commercial Law, 198.)<br\/><br\/>Neither can the contracts that serve as the necessary precedent for the issue of a promissory note payable to order be mistaken for the note itself, the consequences and effects of which are entirely\u00a0 different from the contract or contracts that originated it.<br\/><br\/>A promissory note signed by one person in favor of another, but not to his order, wherein it is simply stated:\u00a0 \"I promise to pay X so much,\" is nothing but an ordinary note, not negotiable.\u00a0 A document of this kind is nothing more than mere written evidence of the contract it represents.\u00a0 But a promissory note payable to order is not merely proof, as is the other one, of the contract therein contained; it is negotiable, indorsable, transferable, without the knowledge or consent of the person who issued and signed it; it is a real instrument of exchange; it is something commutative which the drawer issues in exchange for the money or merchandise that he has received from the holder of the note, or as a result of accounts between them.<br\/><br\/>A promissory note payable to order is a writing whereby the drawer confesses that he is indebted and under the obligation to pay a\u00a0 certain amount to the order of another; it is generally the <i>result<\/i> of a loan, or of merchandise sold, or of outstanding balances of current accounts.\u00a0 (1 Treatise on Commercial Law by D. A. B., 558.)<br\/><br\/>The making of drafts, as well as of bills of exchange and promissory notes, is <i>preceded<\/i> by a contract in the execution of which they are instruments; and both in the making thereof as well as in the rights and duties arising therefrom, the contracting parties must abide by its provisions, <i>independently<\/i> of those which the law grants or imposes in favor of or against the holder of the same.\u00a0 (Perecaula, Dictionary of Commercial Law, 421.)<br\/><br\/>\"The characteristic thing about this contract (of exchange) is the promise and the order of payment, and its chief advantage consists in the facilities afforded to the circulation of the bill of exchange by the form of the promissory note, <i>I will pay to order of<\/i> D..............., thus its\u00a0 transfer was\u00a0 provided for\u00a0 by indorsement, and above all the joint obligation which rested on all those who nominally took part in the subrogation of the\u00a0 draft, or in its circulation, gave to this document the greatest possible guarantee.\u00a0 Later on the necessities of trade caused the form <i>pay to the order of<\/i>............... to be substituted by pay to <i>bearer<\/i>, facilitating, in this manner its transmission or manual delivery.\"\u00a0 (Benito, Les. 80.)<br\/><br\/>In effect, article 544 of the code in force provides that all instruments payable to order may be drawn payable to bearer, and in the preamble of the code it is stated:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"That the plan, in accord with the policy of the new commercial codification, expressly declares-and it so appears in articles 532 and 544-that drafts payable\u00a0 to order between merchants, and <i>vales<\/i> or promissory notes payable to order arising from commercial transactions may be issued to bearer; wherefore the code of 1829, which provided the contrary, is repealed.\u00a0 By virtue of said authority, copartnerships and private individuals are authorized to issue all kinds of documents payable to bearer, with or without security, the latter enjoying greater prerogatives as far as the negotiation, transmission, and recovery of the same is concerned.\"<br\/><br\/><\/blockquote>If the promissory note payable to order or bearer is different from the contract whereby it originated and if said contract is, as a rule, a commercial loan, the true doctrine with regard to the nature of the commercial loan is of the utmost importance.\u00a0 In order, says the learned\u00a0 professor Benito, that a loan be a commercial one, it must constitute <i>per se<\/i> a commercial transaction, or arise from a commercial transaction.\u00a0 A loan constitutes <i>per se<\/i> a commercial transaction when the party contracting it avails himself of said loan as one of the several means of commercial speculation, as is the case for example, with bankers and money lenders in general.\u00a0 And it is made\u00a0 by reason of a commercial transaction when the thing loaned is indispensable to the carrying out of a commercial transaction, as happens, for example, when a person who has no capital at a given moment, contracts a loan in order to avail himself of the decline in\u00a0 price of any product whatever, purchased at the time for the purpose of reselling it when the market value shall improve.\u00a0 In the former case the lender is usually a merchant (he is not one if the act was an isolated and incidental occurrence in his life), and the loan must necessarily bear interest.\u00a0 In the second case it is immaterial whether or not the lender is a merchant, or whether the loan is compensated or gratuitous.\u00a0 (P. 194.)<br\/><br\/>In the latter case, the second condition required by article 311 of the code is accomplished, to wit:\u00a0 \"If the articles loaned are destined to commercial transactions.\"<br\/><br\/>And in the first, as in the second case, in order that it may be known that it arose from a commercial loan, the form of a promissory note payable to order or to the bearer, is no other than the usual one in business:\u00a0 <i>for commercial transactions<\/i>.\u00a0 A promissory note thus made out carries with it the indication that it arose from a commercial transaction wherein either the lender carries out a commercial transaction, or the borrower intends to enter into a business speculation, and gives in exchange a negotiable document.<br\/><br\/>If the defendant has admitted the fact stated in the promissory\u00a0 note, that the amount confessed to have been received was delivered in cash; if he has admitted the fact stated in the note that the maker bound himself to pay it; if said facts\u00a0 constitute essentially a contract of loan, and the fact that the amount delivered was received for commercial transactions was stated in the note, which fact was fully admitted by the defendant and which constitutes the specific character of a commercial loan, and in consequence, and as the result of all of said facts, the\u00a0 instrument of exchange consisting of a promissory note payable to order was executed, the inevitable conclusion is that said note payable to order was the effect, or outcome, of a commercial transaction known as a mercantile loan.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, the words \"value received <i>in cash<\/i> for commercial transactions\" in their true sense determine and presuppose a\u00a0 commercial transaction prior to the date of the promissory note, namely, a mercantile loan.<br\/><br\/><i>Value received<\/i>, according to paragraph 5 of article 444, means that the drawer of a draft or note has received the amount thereof in cash, and, in order that it may appear in writing that he received the same on loan, he sets forth that he binds himself to pay it within the period stipulated by him (up to this point the generic form in every promissory note); and in order to prove that he received it as a commercial loan, he complies with the requisite\u00a0 of the law acknowledging the receipt thereof <i>for commercial transactions<\/i> (the specific thing), and in order that his obligation may not bind him to the lender only, but to any other person who shall acquire the document through free and untramelled negotiation thereof, he issues, not a plain promissory note, which would hold him as liable to a determined person exclusively, but a note payable to order, which he puts in circulation for the purpose of establishing his liability in favor of any other person subrogating his creditor, or with any lawful holder of the document (another commercial transaction); and for this purpose he issues a promissory note <i>payable to order<\/i>, an instrument of exchange representing <i>another<\/i> contract called of exchange, which is the effect of, and for said reason different from the contract of commercial loan, which is the cause thereof.<br\/><br\/>If after all of these facts stated in the note in question, and admitted by the defendant, the maker, Tan-Tongco, had not made it payable to order, but in favor of Geronimo Jose, there would not have existed two contracts, one of loan, and the other of exchange, and, under the law, the promissory note would be nothing more than a written evidence of a contract of loan, invalid save as between Tan-Tongco and Geronimo Jose; and in this case the latter could have only indorsed it erroneously, inefficiently, and illegally.<br\/><br\/>With all the\u00a0 facts stated in the promissory note and admitted by the\u00a0 defendant, and on the hypothesis that Tan-Tongco, in lieu\u00a0 of\u00a0 signing a\u00a0 note made payable to order had signed a plain promissory note in favor of Geronimo Jose, even though it contained the words \"for commercial transactions,\" Geronimo Jose could not have indorsed it, the same not being a note payable to order, which, under the law, is the one\u00a0 that can be indorsed and <br\/><br\/>Consequently, neither could there\u00a0 exist in such a case two contracts, one of loan, and another of exchange, but one only of loan with written evidence, consisting of a private document called a promissory note.<br\/><br\/>But in such a case this\u00a0 sole contract would <i>prima facie<\/i> be a commercial loan (not subject to indorsement or negotiation) for the reason that it is stated that\u00a0 the article loaned was destined to commercial purposes; without prejudice to the right of the party appearing as bound therein to deny said presumed commercial character, by denying that either of the contracting parties was a merchant, the first condition required by article 311.\u00a0 Thus the creditor who is interested in maintaining the <i>prima facie<\/i> commercial character of the note, namely, Geronimo Jose, would be obliged to prove the commercial character of at least one of the contracting parties.\u00a0 But it must be Geronimo Jose himself, and no\u00a0 one else, otherwise we have the absurdity, on the part of the indorser and commercial negotiator of a note denying his own character as a merchant.<br\/><br\/>And although said note arose from a commercial loan, it could not be said to have arisen from a commercial transaction merely because it was so stated; there is no ground for such a statement when there is no operation from which it arose, nor which arose from it, inasmuch as merely one operation took place:\u00a0 a commercial loan <i>without<\/i> a contract of exchange represented\u00a0 by an instrument <i>ad hoc<\/i>, called a promissory note payable to order.\u00a0 And as already stated, this plain promissory note would\u00a0 be nothing more than the evidence of the existence of said sole contract.<br\/><br\/>But as a promissory note payable to order was issued for value received in cash for commercial transactions, a commercial loan exists, by reason of these last words, and because it is payable to order, there is a contract of exchange, which renders it subject to indorsement and negotiation.<br\/><br\/>Tan-Tongco having made out a promissory note payable to the order of Geronimo Jose for 3,600 pesos, Mexican currency, for value received in cash for commercial transactions, at the foot thereof and on the same date Geronimo Jose wrote:\u00a0 \"Pay to the order of the Banco Espa\u00f1ol-Filipino, for value received in cash,\" and signed the indorsement.<br\/><br\/>Geronimo Jose admits that he received from the Banco Espa\u00f1ol-Filipino 3,600 pesos, Mexican, in cash, the same amount as delivered by him to Tan-Tongco in cash.\u00a0 And he now states that he is not obliged to pay it to the Banco Espa\u00f1ol-Filipino, even after acknowledging and admitting the insolvency of Tan-Tangco, which appears in the record of the case.<br\/><br\/>He believes that he is not bound to pay because the document of credit which has been transmitted is not a contract in the sense of a commercial promissory note; that said transmission has not the legal character of an indorsement; that in the matter of promissory notes an indorsement can only take place between those issued by merchants, payable to order, and arising from commercial transactions; that the contract from which the credit originated may be qualified as a civil loan, or commercial promise of payment, and in either case there can be no legal indorsement, but only a transmission of ownership, which produces no liability of payment on the part of the defendant Geronimo Jose, except in the cases defined by articles 1529 of the Civil Code, and 348 of the Code of Commerce.\u00a0 (Brief, 14.)<br\/><br\/>It is also claimed that the contract of promise to pay is not a commercial one by reason of its nature but depends on the contracting parties, because article 532 of the Code of Commerce requires that the same be issued by merchants, payable to order, and arise from commercial transactions, and that it is not the same as a bill of exchange, where the document itself, if made out in legal form, constitutes a commercial contract, even though the parties executing the same be not merchants.\u00a0 (Brief 13.)<br\/><br\/>But neither the law nor commercial practice confirm the assertion that in the matter of promissory notes only those made by merchants, payable to order, and arising from a commercial transaction are indorsable.<br\/><br\/>Article 212 of the Code of Commerce authorizes banks and agricultural associations to loan money in cash or merchandise, for a term not exceeding three years, on fruits, crops, cattle, or any other article or special security, and to guarantee by signature, promissory notes and effects recoverable within the maximum period of ninety days in order to assist the owner or agriculturist in discounting or negotiating the same.\u00a0 An owner or agriculturist is not a merchant; however, the bank or the agricultural association in whose favor he executed a promissory note secured by the products of his farming or cultivation may guarantee it with its indorsement in order to facilitate the discounting or negotiation of the same; and, in accordance with article 214, the indorsement of a promissory note entitles the holder to demand payment at maturity directly and promptly from<br\/>any of the indorsers.<br\/><br\/>The foregoing precepts are in accord with said article 532, which requires nothing more than that promissory notes shall be payable to order and arise from commercial transactions, not that they be issued between\u00a0 merchants as required by said article in reference to drafts, where it states that \"Drafts payable to order between merchants and the bills or promissory notes likewise payable to order, which arise from commercial transactions * * *,\" which first condition was imposed by the Spanish commercial law for the reason that the code of 1829 did not permit a merchant to draw a bill of exchange against himself from a place other than where he resided, nor a bill of exchange from one merchant against another within the same place, requiring the use of drafts for said purposes, the utility of which, now that the code has removed such obstacles, can not be explained, above.all when, according to article 544, a promissory note can be made out to bearer as well as to order.<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing reasons, we are unable to establish as a doctrine that promissory notes, in order that they may be indorsed, and the indorsement be as valid as that on a bill of exchange, must be issued between merchants, and even less where they arise from a commercial loan, for which it is only required that some one of the contracting parties be a merchant, in conformity with article 311.\u00a0 The preamble of the code now in force very clearly states that copartnerships and private individuals are authorized to issue all kind of documents payable to bearer, with or without security.\u00a0 So that, if Tan-Tongco had issued the promissory note in question not to the order of Geronimo Jose, but to bearer, and if Geronimo Jose had appeared before a bank of discount and circulation as the bearer for the purpose of negotiating it or having it discounted, affixing and dating his indorsement thereon, no one would have doubted that the bank, upon discounting the said note \"secured by two responsible signatures and at ninety days,\" was within the scope of article 178 of the Code of Commerce.\u00a0 Therefore, an indorsement made on a promissory note payable to order can not be considered any less binding, on the part of the person who now pretends to deny to his indorsement the validity of his liability for payment, than if the note had been drawn payable to the bearer.\u00a0 An indorsement is an essentially commercial act, especially when in connection with a title of credit payable to order, and, in accordance with article 2 of the Code of Commerce, commercial transactions, whether executed by merchants or not, shall be governed by the provisions contained in said code; this doctrine has been repeatedly applied in jurisprudence and among other decisions in that of the 12th of December, 1889, cited above.<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing, the judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed in all its parts with the costs of this instance against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa, Johnson<\/i>, and <i>Carson, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><br\/><br\/><hr align=\"center\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><br\/><center><b>DISSENTING<\/b><\/center><br\/><b>WILLARD, J., <\/b><br\/><br\/>The document in question in this case is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Three months from this date I hereby promise to pay, in Manila, to the order of D.

Agustin\u00a0 Escribano signed a promissory note, payable to the order of his brother D. Jose Escribano, for the sum of 20,000 <i>reales<\/i> which he had received from D. Jose for commercial purposes with 6 per cent interest thereon, and which would become due and payable in said city on the last day of December of the year 1883.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>The court held that this instrument was not a commercial document, saying:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"Whereas, in order that a <i>'vale'<\/i> or promissory note may be of juridical value as a commercial document it does not suffice that it shall contain the conditions stated in article 571 of the Code of Commerce; it is necessary in addition that it shall arise from commercial transactions, as required by article 558, and the note in question contains no indication whatever that said essential requirement of the law had been fulfilled, because it\u00a0 has only been stated therein that the debtor received the 5,000 pesetas for commercial purposes, and said isolated statement does not disclose that the loan arose, as the law requires, from a commercial transaction, nor can it\u00a0 have any legal value until the truth of the fact contained\u00a0 in said statement is proven, to wit, that the debtor devoted the 5,000 pesetas to commercial purposes.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In the judgment of the supreme court of Spain of the 24th of November, 1894, in a case proceeding from the <i>Audiencia<\/i> of Manila, the following facts appeared:<br\/><blockquote>\"Considering that on the 12th of June, 1889, D. Narciso Paterno signed in Manila a promissory note that would fall due on the 12th of September of said year, payable to the order of V. Jose Gamero for the sum of 1,500 pesos value received in cash, and Gamero indorsed it on the date of its\u00a0 issue to the order of D. Julian de las Cajigas, as value received in cash to his satisfaction for commercial purposes; that said note was renewed at maturity by another wherein Paterno stated that he had received said amount for commercial purposes, a fact which Gamero also stated in the indorsement; that another note drawn up and indorsed in terms similar to the previous one became due on the 12th of December of said year, the latter becoming due in turn on the same terms\u00a0 on the 25th of February, 1890:<br\/><br\/>\"Considering that on the 24th of May of the said year, the day before the maturity of said note of the 25th of February, Paterno signed another made out in the same identical manner as the former and the other two\u00a0 that preceded it, which Gamero indorsed to D. Dionisio de las Cajigas as value received from the latter in cash to his satisfaction, without stating that it was for commercial purposes; that when the period of time fixed in said note became due, the 25th day of August of the aforesaid year 1890, another one was made out which would fall due on the 25th of November, which did not state that the amount received was for commercial purposes, although that fact was mentioned in the indorsement made by Gamero in favor of D. Dionisio de las Cajigas.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The court held that the documents in that case were not commercial ones, saying:<br\/><blockquote>\"Whereas, bills and promissory notes payable to order, to which article 532 of the Code of Commerce grants the same value and effects as to bills of exchange, are not those the amount of which is to be devoted to commercial transactions, but those which <i>arise from transactions<\/i> of this class, in which sense the judgment appealed from is in accordance with its provision which is pointed out as violated, in the first cause of action, in considering as a mere loan under the common law, the loan contained\u00a0 in the obligations which serve as the basis for this suit, for which reason the provisions of article 2 of said code, which are also referred to in the said cause of action can not apply.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The court below relied in its decision upon the case of the\u00a0 Banco Espa\u00f1ol-Filipino <i>vs.<\/i> Tan-Tongco (5 Phil. Rep., 208).\u00a0 It does not appear from the report of that case what the nature of the document was, but an examination of the record remaining in this court shows that it was similar to the one in question.\u00a0 In that case the court held that in order to charge an indorser upon a commercial paper it was not necessary that he be notified of the protest.\u00a0 That was the only question discussed and decided.\u00a0 It was assumed that the document in question was a mercantile one and\u00a0 no claim to the contrary was made.\u00a0 I think that the judgment in this case should be reversed.<br\/><\/div>",

Martin, Felipe San Joaquin, and Bruno de los Santos as bankers, willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously maintained a gambling house in the barrio, wherein during the said months of April, May, June, and July, 1907, and especially on the 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th of July, 1907, the game called '<i>monte<\/i>' which is a game of chance or hazard, was played.<br\/><br\/>\"That the said accused in their respective characters, to wit, the first named as owner of the house, and the latter as bankers, willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously encouraged the said game of '<i>monte<\/i>' during the said months and in the said house, where from forty to fifty persons assembled as gamblers, gambling being regularly carried on in the said house.\u00a0 All contrary to law.\" <\/blockquote><br\/>The lower court, after hearing the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause, found each of the defendants guilty of the crime charged in the said complaint, and sentenced each of them to be imprisoned at hard labor, in the provincial jail of the Province of Ambos Camarines, for a period of two months and one day of <i>arresto mayor<\/i>, each to pay a fine of P125, Philippine currency, and in case of insolvency to suffer subsidiary imprisonment in accordance with the provisions of law, and each to pay one-sixth part of the costs.<br\/><br\/>From this sentence the defendants appealed to this court and made the following assignments of error:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"1.\u00a0 For not refusing to hear the case as set forth in the complaint when same should have been heard in the justice of the peace court.<br\/><br\/>\"2.\u00a0 For not stating with clearness and precision the law that was\u00a0 violated by the parties whom I represent.<br\/><br\/>\"3.\u00a0 For affirming that the accused are guilty of the crime alleged in the complaint, according to the evidence and beyond reasonable doubt.<br\/><br\/>\"4.\u00a0 For holding that my client, Manuel Flores, testified falsely at the trial of the case.<br\/><br\/>\"5.\u00a0 For sentencing the accused to suffer subsidiary imprisonment\u00a0 in case of insolvency.<br\/><br\/>\"6.\u00a0 For holding that my client, Estefania Mendoza, was guilty of the crime charged, and for sentencing her, a woman, to hard labor.\" <\/blockquote> From an examination of the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause the following facts seem to be proven, beyond peradventure of doubt:<br\/><br\/>That at the time and place mentioned in the complaint, and for a long period prior thereto, the defendant Estefania Mendoza occupied, used and controlled as her own property a house in the central part of the town of Nueva Caceres in the Province of Ambos\u00a0 Camarines; that during the months of April, May, June, and until the 25th day of July, 1907, many persons, at times twenty or more, assembled in said house\u00a0 during the night-time, and then and there played a prohibited gambling game commonly known as <i>\"monte\"<\/i> in which game sums of money were bet by the persons present, who took part in said game; that the evidence shows that the said game was carried on in said house at least on seventeen different occasions; that the other defendants, Manuel Flores, Martin Marcelo, Felipe San Joaquin, and Bruno de los Santos, acted as bankers at different times during the time the said game was going on; that these last-named defendants had charge of and played the cards used in said game, employing all the requisites and equipments for the conduct of said game; that the gains and profits, whatever they were, resulting from said gambling game, were divided among the said bankers and the defendant Estefania Mendoza; that Estefania Mendoza not only accepted a portion of the\u00a0 profits resulting from such game, but consented that the same be played in her house; that the persons who assembled in the house, as above indicated, usually assembled at about 8.30 o'clock at night, and remained there playing until sometimes as late as 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning.<br\/><br\/>All of the defendants testified in their own behalf during the trial of the cause except Bruno de los Santos; each denied any participation in the crime charged.\u00a0 The defendant Manuel Flores admitted that during the time in question he played for money in the said house on four different occasions, but that the game was not <i>\"monte\"<\/i> but was the game of \"<i>entrecuatro.<\/i>\"<br\/><br\/>With reference to the first assignment of error, the appellants allege, in effect, that the Court of First Instance did not have jurisdiction of the crime; that the crime was within the jurisdiction of the justice of the peace.<br\/><br\/>During the trial of the cause the defendants introduced an ordinance enacted by the municipal council of the <i>pueblo<\/i> of Nueva Caceres, providing the punishment for the offense of gambling.\u00a0 This ordinance provides for a fine of from P25 to P100 for its violation.\u00a0 The present complaint, however, charges a violation of the provisions of article 343 of the Penal Code.\u00a0 Said article 343 provides:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"The bankers and proprietors of a house where games of chance, stakes, or hazard are played, shall be punished with the penalty of <i>arresto mayor and a fine of from 625 to 6,250 pesetas<\/i>, and, in case of a repetition, with those of <i>arresto mayor<\/i> in its maximum degree to <i>prision correccional<\/i> in its minimum degree, and a fine double the above mentioned.\" <\/blockquote><br\/>The defendants cite section 108 of General Orders, No. 58, as well as section 56, paragraph 6 of Act No. 136, and also section 4 of Act No. 1627, for the purpose of sustaining their contention that the present action was within the original jurisdiction of the justice of the peace.\u00a0 It will be noted, upon a reading of these provisions of the law relating to the jurisdiction of the justice of the peace, that he has original jurisdiction only of cases where the imprisonment is six months and a fine not exceeding $100\u00a0 (P2Q0).\u00a0 It is clear, therefore, that the justice of the peace did not have jurisdiction of the present crime.\u00a0 The Court of First Instance had jurisdiction of the crime charged against the defendants.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the second assignment of error, that the lower court failed to designate in his decision the provision of law violated, it is true that the sentence of the lower court does not indicate the particular provision of law violated by the defendants.\u00a0 This was not error, however, if the lower court did actually apply the proper provision of the Penal Code to the facts established by the proof during the trial of the cause.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the third assignment of error, to wit, that the lower court committed an error in holding that the proof adduced during the trial was sufficient to show that the defendants were guilty\u00a0 of the crime charged, we are of the opinion and so hold that the lower court committed no error in making this declaration.\u00a0 We have examined said proof and find that the same does, beyond peradventure of doubt, show that the defendants were guilty of the crime charged in said complaint.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the fourth assignment of error, to wit, that the lower court committed an error in declaring that the defendant Manuel Flores swore falsely as a witness during the trial of the cause, we are of the opinion and so hold that the finding of the lower court, taken in connection with the testimony given by the defendant during the trial, was entirely justified.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the fifth assignment of error, to wit, that the lower court committed an error in imposing subsidiary imprisonment\u00a0 upon the defendants in case of their insolvency, we are of the opinion and so hold that under the provisions of article 50, in its relation with paragraph 5 of article 49 of the Penal Code, the lower court committed no error in imposing subsidiary imprisonment.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the sixth assignment of error, to wit, that the lower court committed an error in condemning Estefania Mendoza to imprisonment at <i>hard labor<\/i>, there seems to be no provision of the Penal Code authorizing the court to impose the penalty of hard labor in addition to the penalty of imprisonment.\u00a0 It seem that the nature of the employment of persons sentenced to imprisonment under the provisions of the Penal Code is left to the character of the penalty imposed.<br\/><br\/>Upon an examination of all of the facts of record brought to this court, in our opinion the defendants are guilty of the crime charged, and they are each hereby sentenced to be imprisoned for a period of two months and one day of <i>arresto mayor<\/i>, each to pay a fine of P125, Philippine currency, and in case of insolvency each to suffer subsidiary imprisonment in accordance with the provisions of law, and each to pay one-sixth part of the costs.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

the attacked party stopped the blow with his left arm which was broken in so doing.\u00a0 The fracture prevented him from working, and took more than ninety days to heal, the physician who attended the patient stating that by reason of articular complications which followed the knitting of the fractured bone, which knitting takes place as a rule within forty days when no complications follow, it turned out that the injured man could not use his arm as freely as he did before he was injured, although it was possible that he might be completely cured later on.<br\/><br\/>In view of the above, a complaint was filed by the provincial fiscal on the 19th of August, 1908, charging the brothers Aurelio and Venancio Monasterial with the crime of <i>lesiones graves<\/i>, and proceedings having been instituted, the trial court entered judgment therein on the 8th of October, 1908, sentencing each of the\" accused to the penalty of one year and one day of <i>prision correccional<\/i>, jointly and severally to indemnify the injured party\u00a0 in the sum of P80, for medical expenses, to pay him 50 centavos for medicine, and P40 for his work, and in case of insolvency to suffer corresponding subsidiary imprisonment not to exceed one-third of the main penalty, and each to pay one-half of the costs.\u00a0 From said judgment the accused have appealed.<br\/><br\/>From the above-stated facts which have been fully proven in this case it appears that the crime of <i>lesiones graves<\/i>, defined and punished by article 416, paragraph 3, of the Penal Code has been committed, inasmuch as the injured party, in consequence of the heavy blow received by him on the left arm, suffered the fracture of the bone of said limb, and was ill and unable to use the same for more than ninety days by reason of the articular complication that followed; and notwithstanding that an examination made by the physician showed that the said bone had knitted, yet the damaged arm could not be used as it had been before it was broken.<br\/><br\/>The two accused pleaded not guilty and denied the charge, but notwithstanding their exculpatory allegations which fail to prove their case, the record contains conclusive and satisfactory proof that Fruto Payoyo was set upon simultaneously by Venancio, who commenced the attack by striking him a blow with the clenched fist\u00a0 while holding him by the shirt front, and by Aurelio who, while Payoyo was still held, struck him with a stick on the left arm, fracturing the bone.\u00a0 It does not appear that the\u00a0 aggression was provoked by Payoyo, the injured man.<br\/><br\/>The two accused brothers, angry because of the information that they thought the injured party had given their father to the effect that they were hiring out his carabaos, attempted to punish the informer.\u00a0 To that end, and by mutual agreement, upon seeing him on the street they stopped and attacked him, if not simultaneously, almost at the same time and within a few seconds of one another, and in this manner accomplished their common purpose of injuring Payoyo, each of them taking a direct and material part in the assault with the sole object of inflicting the punishment that they had resolved upon.\u00a0 Therefore, they are both criminally responsible for the injury suffered by the injured party, and for all the consequences of their unlawful and punishable acts.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding the fact that the broken arm did not heal in less than ninety days, owing to complications that incapacitated the patient from work for a longer period of time, and made it difficult for him to use the arm, it should be noted that if the accused had not attacked or maltreated the injured party the arm would not have been broken, nor would the former have incurred the penalty imposed by the law.\u00a0 All those who are responsible for an act which constitutes a crime are equally liable for all the consequences arising therefrom, and which are inherent therein; for example, such complications as may arise and which are not due to circumstances completely foreign to the act committed, or from the fault or carelessness of the injured party himself, exceptions which do not exist in the present case.<br\/><br\/>In view of the fact that in the commission of the crime no mitigating nor aggravating circumstance is present, the proper penalty should be imposed in the medium degree, as requested by the Solicitor-General.<br\/><br\/>For the reasons above set forth it is our opinion that the judgment appealed from should be reversed and that Venancio and Aurelio Monasterial should be sentenced, as we do hereby sentence them, to the penalty of one year eight months and twenty-one days of <i>prision correccional<\/i>, to the accessory penalties of article 61 of the code, to jointly and severally indemnify the offended party in the sum stated in said judgment, with the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment therein referred to, and to each pay half the costs of both instances.\u00a0 So ordered,<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Mapa, Johnson, Carson<\/i>, and <i>Moreland, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><\/div>",

Rep., 259.)<br\/><br\/>This acceptance, of course, would not prevent the defendant from subsequently raising the objection that there existed hidden defects in the construction of said house.\u00a0 No question is raised here by the defendant that there were any defects in the labor or material furnished which are not discoverable upon a casual examination.\u00a0 The acceptance of the house, therefore, precludes the defendant from raising any question as to the work or material furnished.<br\/><br\/>The defendant did, at the time he entered into the possession of the property, make the objection that the construction of the house was not all completed.\u00a0 This objection having been made at the time the defendant took possession of the property, he was entitled to prove, during the trial, the value of such incompleted work.\u00a0 The evidence relating to the value of the work incompleted varied somewhat.\u00a0 The lower court found that the cost of completing the house in accordance with the contract amounted to P286.26.\u00a0 Upon an examination of the evidence upon this particular question, we are satisfied that the finding of the lower court was in accordance with the preponderance of the evidence.<br\/><br\/>The value of the original contract, together with the additions made, amounted to P6,250.\u00a0 The record shows that the defendant had paid to the plaintiff, at the time of the delivery to him of the said house, the sum of P5,289, leaving a balance due the plaintiff from the defendant of P961, the amount which would have been due the plaintiff except for the fact that the defendant had expended the sum of P286.26 in furnishing labor and material for the completion of the said contract.\u00a0 There is therefore due the plaintiff on his contract the sum of P961, less the said sum of P286.26, or a balance of P674.74.\u00a0 For this\u00a0 amount the lower court rendered a judgment.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff also appealed from the decision of the lower court, making the following assignments of error:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"I.\u00a0 The court erred in ordering the reopening of the trial without having annulled the judgment rendered in the case, contrary to the provisions of section 145 of the Code of Civil Procedure, touching new trials.<br\/><br\/>\"II.\u00a0 The court erred in annulling the judgment rendered on October 2, 1907, and in granting the reopening of the trial, without any motion\u00a0 therefor by the aggrieved party; contrary to the provisions of said section.<br\/><br\/>\"III.\u00a0 The court erred in ordering the holding of the new trial, the petition for the same not being based on any of the motives specifically mentioned therefor by the said section 145; contrary to the same section.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>These assignments of error may all be discussed under one head\u2014to wit, that the lower court committed an error in granting a new trial under the provisions of section 145 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions.<br\/><br\/>The conditions under which a judge may grant a new trial are very broad.\u00a0 The court may grant a new trial upon the motion of the parties or upon his own motion.\u00a0 The judge may grant a new trial on\u00a0 his own motion on finding that excessive damages have been granted, or that the evidence was insufficient to justify his decision or that his decision was against the law.\u00a0 The record does not disclose precisely upon what ground the lower court granted a new trial.\u00a0 The plaintiff and appellant gives no sufficient reason for declaring that the lower court abused his discretion in granting a new trial.<br\/><br\/>For all of the foregoing reasons the judgment of the lower court is hereby affirmed, and it is directed that judgment be entered\u00a0 against the defendant and in favor\u00a0 of the plaintiff for the sum of P674.74, with interest at 6 per cent from the 28th day of February, 1907, and costs.\u00a0 It is so ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Rep., 541.\u00a0 The judgment there appealed from was affirmed as to the defendant Uy Su Liong but was reversed and a new trial ordered as to the defendants Juan Te Chico and Cu Ung Jeng.\u00a0 In the opinion upon that appeal the court said (p. 544) :<br\/><blockquote>\"There was evidence in the court below tending to prove the allegations of the complaint against some at least of the defendants, which evidence made out a <i>prima facie<\/i> case in favor of the plaintiffs.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Upon the second trial the plaintiffs introduced the same evidence that was introduced at the first trial and there appeared, moreover, a letter written by the then manager of the business at Iloilo, Ong Bun Po, to the manager at Manila, in which he said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The debts we owed Hoc Jua Bee you must ask for an extension of time to pay him until our business becomes better.\u00a0 If not, we are hard in getting money to pay in cash.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The additional evidence introduced by the defendants at the second trial did not in any way destroy the <i>prima facie<\/i> case made by the plaintiffs.\u00a0 The court below entered judgment for the amount claimed in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendants Juan Te Chico, Trinidad Jurado Te Quim Jua, Cu Ung Jeng, Ang Ban Gui, and Ang Ban Bi.\u00a0 From this judgment Juan Te Chico an4 Cu Ung Jeng have appealed.\u00a0 The others have not appealed.<br\/><br\/>The additional evidence introduced by the defendants not having affected the force of the plaintiffs' testimony, the latter were entitled to judgment against some of the defendants.\u00a0 The question is, whether they are entitled to judgment against the two appellants.<br\/><br\/>That the plaintiffs as individuals can maintain this action, although their partnership articles were not recorded in the registry, has been settled by the decisions of this court.\u00a0 (Prautch <i>vs<\/i>. Jones, 8 Phil. Rep., 1.)\u00a0 The defendant partnership was devoted entirely to commercial transactions, to the buying and selling of personal property with a view to profit.\u00a0 It was, therefore, a commercial partnership and the liability of the members thereof must be determined by the Code of Commerce. (Hung-Man-Yoc <i>vs<\/i>. Kieng-Chiong-Seng, 6 Phil. Rep., 498.)<br\/><br\/>Considerable evidence was presented in the court below to show the custom among Chinese merchants in the Philippines relating to the organization of commercial partnerships, such evidence tending to show that in such organizations they disregarded entirely the provisions of the Code of Commerce, and it is apparently claimed that custom has the effect of law and that the rights of Chinese merchants and persons dealing with them must be determined not by the law in force in the Islands relating to commercial partnerships, but by such customs as they may see fit to follow, which customs are directly contrary to the provisions of the Code of Commerce.\u00a0 No argument is necessary to show that there is nothing whatever in this contention.<br\/><br\/>We will first consider the liability of Cu Ung Jeng.<br\/><br\/>The contract between the defendants was evidenced by the notarial document made on the 22d of December, 1902, by the terms of which Juan Te Chico, Cu Ung Jeng, and Ang Ban Gui formed a special partnership (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">sociedad en comandita<\/span>), the general partner being Juan Te Chico and the special partners being Cu Ung Jeng and Ang Ban Gui.\u00a0 Each of the partners contributed 4,000 pesos as capital, the name of the partnership was declared to be Te Chico, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">sociedad en comandita<\/span>, and the entire management of the business was entrusted to Juan Te Chico.\u00a0 The articles of partnership were never recorded in the mercantile registry.\u00a0 The partnership, therefore, never acquired any juridical personality.\u00a0 Article 24 of the Code of Commerce is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Articles constituting associations not recorded shall be binding between the members who execute the same; but they shall not prejudice third persons, who, however, may make use thereof in so far as advantageous.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>But this article does not aid the plaintiffs so far as Cu Ung Jeng is concerned because his liability is, by the terms thereof, limited to the amount of money which he invested and under the provisions of the Code of Commerce relating to special partnerships (<i>sociedades en comandita<\/i>) no personal liability can be imposed upon a special partner who has actually contributed to the capital of the partnership the amount which he agreed to contribute.\u00a0 If, however, that document be eliminated from the case and it be considered that the contract between the parties was the entry made in the books of the company when it was first organized in 1899, the case would then fall directly within the decision of Hung-Man-Yoc <i>vs<\/i>. Kieng-Chiong-Seng (6 Phil. Rep., 498) above cited.\u00a0 In that case it is said (p. 500) :<br\/><blockquote>\"The agent Yu-Yec-Pin himself and some of his so-called partners have merely noted in the books of the partnership, which by the way, were not introduced in evidence, the capital which each had contributed.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In that case it was held that one of the partners, Chua Che Co, who had contributed a part of the capital but who had taken no part in the management of the business, who had made no contract with the plaintiffs, and whose name did not appear in the partnership title, was not responsible for the debts of the concern.\u00a0 Those facts all appear in the case at bar.<br\/><br\/>The name under which the defendant partnership or business was operated prior to 1902 was Sam Jap Jim &amp; Co.\u00a0 Although the name indicated in the articles of partnership of 1902 was Te Chico, sodedad en comandita, yet it seems that the business was still carried on in the name of Sam Jap Jim &amp; Co.\u00a0 The name of Cu Ung Jeng does not appear in either one of these designations.\u00a0 He took no part whatever in the management of the business of the company, either in Iloilo or Manila.\u00a0 He never made any contract with the plaintiffs in connection with the business of the defendant company.\u00a0 He, therefore, can not be held liable for its debts.<br\/><br\/>Mere participation in the profits of a commercial partnership by a person does not necessarily make such person liable for the debts of the partnership.\u00a0 (Bourns <i>vs<\/i>. Carman, 7 Phil. Rep., 117; Fortis <i>vs<\/i>. Gutierrez Hermanos, 6 Phil. Rep., 100.)<br\/><br\/>As to Juan Te Chico, it is apparent that the judgment must be affirmed.\u00a0 He was the sole manager of the business and carried it on, either personally or through his agents, and in accordance with the provisions of article 120 of the Code of Commerce is personally responsible for the debts of the partnership.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below so far as it relates to Juan Te Chico is affirmed, with the costs of this instance against him.\u00a0 So far as it relates to Cu Ung Jeng, it is reversed and he is acquitted of the complaint, with the costs of the first instance against the plaintiffs.\u00a0 No costs will be allowed to him in this court.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Foz on June 15, 1908, for payment on July 5, proximo, and indorsed by said Sr. Bedoya to the order of 'The Schweiger Import &amp; Export Co.'\u2014On the 5th day of July next, after having collected from Sr. Foz the said amount of P1,807.00, we will deliver to Sr. Emilio Bedoya the sum of four hundred and ninety-four pesos and 60\/100 (P494.60) and the invoices of the merchandise received 'on\u00a0 commission by Sr. Bedoya; his account being thus balanced to date.\u2014Manila 25th of June, 1908.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>The testimony of the accused was entirely in accord with that of the witness for the prosecution, but he added the following.\u00a0 He said:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"Sr. Faini kept the draft and I returned to my house.\u00a0 Afterwards, on the following day, he indorsed the draft to me with the statement that it was not a regular bill of exchange and that the signature was not good because the person signing it was not a responsible one; but the date was omitted, a fact which I did not notice till later on; I called Sr. Faini's attention to the fact that no date had been put on the indorsement, and his reply was more or less as follows:\u00a0 'I know very well what I have done by not dating this draft, and I have nothing more to say about it.'\u00a0 I then went to see a notary and arranged\u00a0 with him to add another indorsement in the same form and without date, which I willingly did, and handed him the draft.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>Faini continued the history of the draft in his possession and\u00a0 said:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"On the 5th of July, the day it became due, I called at the dwelling house or law office of Sr. Foz in order to collect the draft, and was there informed that Sr. Foz had never lived in that house, but that he had happened to be there the other day, and another person who was there told me: 'he must live in Calle Centeno, No. 174 or 184;' there I found Sr. Foz who was sick, and I told him: 'I have come to collect the draft that you accepted,' and he answered 'I won't pay except to Sr. Bedoya because you have no confidence in my signature.\u00a0 Come with Sr. Bedoya and I will pay the draft.\u00a0 Thereafter I went to look for Sr. Bedoya and called at the restaurant where he eats and left word for him to come to the office, and when he came to the office I asked him to see if he could find Sr. Foz in order to get him to cash the draft and I told him that I would not give him back his receipt, nor sign it until after the draft had been cashed.\u00a0 After that I saw no more of Sr. Bedoya, and have come to the conclusion that he did not want to pay, and since then have seen nobody else.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>Under cross-examination on this point the accused replied as follows:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"Q.\u00a0 Have you not received the merchandise mentioned in the invoice marked 'Exhibit A'?\u2014A.\u00a0 Yes, sir.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 Have you not paid for them yet?\u2014A.\u00a0 Not in cash.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 Have you paid for them in any way?\u2014A.\u00a0 I have paid money for them, P500 in cash.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 And have you paid the balance?\u2014A.\u00a0 Yes, sir.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 How?\u2014A.\u00a0 With a draft for P1,807.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 Is this the draft [Exhibit B]?\u2014A.\u00a0 Yes, sir.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 Has it been paid?\u2014A.\u00a0 I am unable to say whether it has been paid or not.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 You are now testifying under oath, and you know very well that this draft is still unpaid, and that Sr. Foz does not intend to pay it.\u2014A.\u00a0 I am not aware of that.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 Don't you know that Sr. Foz has not even half money enough with which to pay this draft?\u2014A.\u00a0 I have no reasons to know it.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 Is it not true that Sr. Foz has no money to even pay for the house in which he is living, and that he has to move from one house to another because he does not pay his rent?\u2014A.\u00a0 I have no knowledge of that.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 Is it not true that Sr. Faini asked you to go along with him\u00a0 to the house of Sr. Foz in order\u00a0 to collect this draft?\u2014A.\u00a0 No, not in order to collect.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 Is it not true that what you wanted to do with this draft, which you knew very well was worthless, a piece of waste paper, was to get Messrs. Schweiger to accept it as good so that you might evade a charge of <i>estafa<\/i>?\u2014A.\u00a0 No.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>The Court of First Instance of the city of Manila that tried the case, rendered judgment sentencing the accused to two years and three months of <i>prision correccional<\/i> in the public prison of Bilibid, to restore to The Schweiger Import and Export Company, or indemnify it in the sum of P1,312.40, Philippine currency, equivalent to 6,562 pesetas, and in case of insolvency to suffer subsidiary imprisonment, and to pay the costs.\u00a0 From this judgment the accused has appealed.<br\/><br\/>The appeal, together with what has been alleged by the appellant\u00a0 and the Attorney-General, having been heard before this court it appears:<br\/><br\/>That the Attorney-General, in rebuttal of the allegations of the defense, wherein it is claimed that the'accused received the goods in question as sold to him and not on commission, maintains conclusively that the contract between the appellant and the above-mentioned company was not one of purchase and sale on credit, but, as shown by the invoice signed by the appellant (Exhibit A), on commission.\u00a0 This point is unquestionable; the accused himself, with his own hand wrote:\u00a0 <i>Received on commission<\/i>.\u00a0 He can not go back on his own act.<br\/><br\/>That, such a contract existing, under the terms of which the appellant really appears to have received goods which belonged to another;\u00a0 and the whole question consisting in whether or not the commission agent had returned the goods or paid for them after thirty days from the time of receiving them, the Attorney-General claims the contrary, that is to say, that no such payment has been made as pretended by the accused for the following reasons:<br\/><br\/>1. Because the delivery of a draft in payment of an obligation can\u00a0 only\u00a0 produce the effects of such payment when collected.\u00a0 (Art. 1170, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>2. Because the draft was delivered to the company in interest on the 22d of June, 1908, a date subsequent to the 18th, on which\u00a0 date the thirty days allowed the accused within which to return the unsold goods, or to pay for those that were sold, expired.<br\/><br\/>3. Because the accused knew the said\u00a0 draft to be valueless, and that it would never be paid at maturity.<br\/><br\/>4. Because the goods were not sold to Gallegos, their value, in fact, having previously been received from Andres Frois, and same was not delivered to the complaining company.<br\/><br\/>5. Because the draft was not adversely affected through any fault of the company, as shown by the efforts made by Mr. Faini after the 22d of June to collect the same.<br\/><br\/>After a careful examination of the above claims it appears that the facts alleged in No. 4, that is that Andres Frois, a witness for the defense, had delivered to the accused the value of the goods which the accused kept for himself instead of turning the same over to the complaining company, has not been proven; the only thing that said witness declared was, that the accused had leased from him the <i>entresuelo<\/i> of the house in Calle Santa Rosa of which he occupied the upper part, and that he kept the goods there, and that he had received goods in said house, on mortgage from Bedoya in his capacity as a broker; that those goods on which the mortgage had been foreclosed had been sold, and those on which there had been no foreclosure had been removed.<br\/><br\/>But even though it were proven that Frois had delivered to the accused the value of the goods which the latter received on commission from the interested firm, and that he kept the same, inasmuch as the essence of the crime charged herein consists in the nonpayment of the value of the goods sold or the nonreturn of such as were not sold, and as the accused maintains that he had paid the value of said goods, and that the form of payment was accepted by the interested firm, the fourth as well as,the second contention of the Attorney-General has absolutely no bearing on this point in the case; the last-mentioned, because what-ever may have been the time when payment was made, even after the lapse of the thirty days, which are supposed, though erroneously, to be the time fixed for the payment or the return, once the creditor accepted the same, the commission of a crime can not be alleged, but, at\u00a0 most, the violation of some of the conditions of the contract consisting of delinquency or some other liability of a civil nature.<br\/><br\/>The accused states that his obligation to pay P1,312.40 has been fulfilled through delivering to the creditor, by means of an indorsement, a bill of exchange for P1,807.<br\/><br\/>The courts of justice can not go outside of the following limitations:\u00a0 either the commission agent paid and the obligation was fulfilled, or he did not pay, and the obligation still stands to return the goods received on commission, or otherwise clear himself of the responsibility for the crime of <i>estafa<\/i> that is involved in appropriating to himself money or personal property received only on commission, and pertaining to another.<br\/><br\/>Nor is it of the least consequence, for the proper consideration of\u00a0 the only fact which the courts are called upon to pass, whether the indorsement of the draft by the payee to a third party was in collusion, or whether the drawer Gallegos, the payee Bedoya, and Foz, who accepted the draft, were in combination or collusion for the purpose of deceiving a creditor, the third party.\u00a0 The law has clearly defined the effects of every judicial act, and the respective rights and obligations of each of the persons who directly or indirectly take part in the execution of a contract; therefore, this court must ignore the third contention.<br\/><br\/>Only the first and fifth points in the above argument of the Attorney-General can be considered in deciding the case.<br\/><br\/>As to the pretended payment on the part of the accused debtor, what took place and is fully proven is:\u00a0 First, the delivery, by the accused to the complaining firm, of a bill of exchange drawn by Gallegos in favor of Bedoya and accepted by Foz (for the amount already stated), delivery being accomplished by means of an indorsement in proper form; second, the return of the bill of exchange by the complaining firm to the debtor or payee, Bedoya, by means of an imperfect indorsement in improper form, that is to say not dated; third, another imperfect indorsement without date, made by Bedoya to the complaining firm; fourth, the presentation and demand for payment made by the said complaining firm on the drawee, Foz, and the failure on the part of the latter to pay; and fifth, the holding of the draft in the hands of the complaining firm until the moment when the information was given and the complaint filed.<br\/><br\/>No protest whatever was made against either the acceptor, the indorser, or the drawer, for said failure to pay.<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"The ownership of a draft shall be transferred by indorsement.\"\u00a0 (Art. 461 Code of Commerce.)<br\/><br\/>\"If the statement of the date is omitted in the indorsement, the ownership of the draft shall not be transferred, and it shall be understood as simply a commission for collection.\"\u00a0 (<i>Ibid<\/i>, 463.)<\/blockquote><br\/>By the indorsement in proper form made by the payee, Bedoya, on the 22d of June, 1908, in favor of the complaining firm, the latter became the owner of the draft.<br\/><br\/>But, by the imperfect indorsement made in turn by the complaining firm to the payee, Bedoya, the ownership of the draft was not returned to the latter; he was only commissioned to collect it.<br\/><br\/>By the indorsement, also an imperfect one, made by the payee, Bedoya, to the complaining firm, no alteration was made in the legal status of affairs beyond the material return of the draft and the maintainance thereby of the position of the complaining firm, which was that of holder or bearer of the draft up to the moment when an action was brought before the courts.<br\/><br\/>According to article 469 of the Code of Commerce\u2014<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"Drafts which are not presented for acceptance or payment within the period fixed shall be affected thereby, as well as when they <i>are not protested at the proper time.<\/i><br\/><br\/>\"If the holder of a bill of exchange should not present it for collection on the day it falls due, or, in the absence of payment, <i>does not have it protested on the following day<\/i>, he shall lose his right to be reimbursed by the indorsers; and with regard to the drawer, the provisions\u00a0 of articles 458 and 460 shall be observed.\"\u00a0 (Code of Commerce, 483.)<\/blockquote><br\/>In accordance with article 1170 of the Civil Code\u2014<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"The delivery of promissory notes to order or drafts or other commercial paper shall only produce the effects of payment when collected or when, by the fault of the creditor, <i>their value has been affected.\"<\/i><\/blockquote><br\/>Hence, the delivery of a bill of exchange shall produce the effects of payment when, by the fault of the creditor, its value has been affected.<br\/><br\/>The value of the draft in question, received and held by the creditor, the complaining firm, was adversely affected by reason of its not having been protested on the following day after the drawee, Foz, refused to pay the bearer, the complaining firm, the value thereof.<br\/><br\/>Protest should be made by the possessor of the draft, and the possessor of the draft in this case was the complaining firm; therefore, the value of the draft was adversely affected through the fault of the creditor.<br\/><br\/>All the steps taken by said creditor did not go beyond a demand for payment; it failed to take the very one whereby the draft while in his hands would not become adversely affected, and if collusion was suspected, and persons of doubtful honesty and even of notorious insolvency were concerned, one can not conceive\u2014unless it was through ignorance of the law, which is no excuse\u2014why the draft was held and retained, being, in the opinion of the holder or bearer, worthless, and why he failed to take a step the omission of which, besides probably affecting him adversely, might engender another manifest injury, previously covered by a law which is of universal application in all civilized nations.<br\/><br\/>As the courts must hold under the civil aspect of the case, that, as no protest was made the draft was adversely affected; that the obligation to protest rested upon the holder of the draft, in this case the creditor; and that from the fact that the draft was adversely affected through the fault of the creditor, it produces the effects of a payment to him, the courts can not, under the criminal law, decide or hold that the commission agent had not made payment, and that for the lack thereof he committed the crime of <i>estafa<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>All the incriminations contained in the questions put by the prosecution as to just how much the indorser knew about the insolvency of the person who accepted the draft, inasmuch as he owned no property, and did not meet his obligations, must perforce recoil upon the holder or bearer of the same, who, suspecting that it would not be paid, nevertheless retained it, and in addition, through his inactivity and procrastination destroyed the possibility of collection from the drawee or from the indorser.<br\/><br\/>Had protest been made, the nonpayment of the draft would have become proven in the only manner in which the law requires proof to\u00a0 be made; and then, apart from the civil action\u2014and probably a criminal one also, if it is true that collusion existed and can be proven or shown\u2014the delivery of the draft by the commission agent to the constituent firm would not have produced the effects of a payment, because it was not adversely affected by the fault of the creditor; rather on the contrary, it would have been clearly shown that payment had not been made, and that consequently these proceedings for <i>estafa<\/i> could have been instituted.<br\/><br\/>That a draft or document which one has accepted by indorsement is worthless because it is the result of collusion between the drawer, drawee, and the indorser, and the supposition that all of them are insolvent, does not warrant a person, under the law, to remain absolutely inactive, allowing fixed periods to elapse, and ignoring legal precepts which must necessarily be observed-when a juridical act is accomplished such as the transfer of a draft which is subject thereto; for juridical acts involve not only rights, but also obligations.<br\/><br\/>When the creditor firm in its turn indorsed the draft back to the party who indorsed it to them, they could have relieved themselves of the ownership and possession thereof by indorsing it in proper form, and they would then have had nothing to do with a draft which, in their opinion, was of no value, would have severed connection with people of doubtful solvency, and might at once have taken action in connection with the commission; but instead of that they made an imperfect indorsement, not dating it, thus continuing to be the owners of the draft; and when questioned by the new indorsee as to why it was not dated, as if to find out whether the draft was returned to him, or whether he was merely commissioned to collect it, the creditor replied \"I know what I have done,\" and demanded a fresh indorsement in their favor in identical form, as if to recover the draft and ratify the ownership and possession thereof; that is, to maintain the previous status of the draft.<br\/><br\/>Against a series of acts so well defined as the above, each of which has its corresponding juridical effect, there is nothing to be gained by insisting upon the status of creditor ship (something that\u00a0 might have been done without them) in order to clearly set forth before the courts of justice that the debtor has not paid, that he has embezzled the money of another, and\u00a0 has committed estafa.\u00a0 Consequently the charge of <i>estafa<\/i> herein has no legal foundation.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is hereby reversed, with the costs of both instances declared <i>de oficio<\/i>.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson<\/i>, and <i>Moreland, JJ.,<\/i> concur.<\/div>",

all this in violation of the statute in such cases made and provided.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>Gonzaga demanded and was granted a separate trial.\u00a0 Ramos and Jarabas were tried together.\u00a0 Ramos was absolved, and Jarabas was convicted and sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion temporal<\/i>, and to be confined in the Insular Penitentiary of the Philippine Islands for a period of fourteen years eight months and one day, and to pay a fine of 1,250 pesetas, and to pay one-half the costs of this action, the other half to be taxed <i>de oficio<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>On this appeal by Jarabas, the single question is whether the evidence justifies his conviction.\u00a0 It is charged that Ramos simulated a contract between the municipality and one Enabe for the supply by the latter of rations to certain persons held in quarantine; approved certain accounts purporting to have been signed by Enabe, and certified vouchers therefor, which were presented to the treasurer, Gonzaga, by Jarabas, to whom the money was paid; that Gonzaga in his accounts-current with the Government included these vouchers, asserting that the money therefor had been paid to Enabe.\u00a0\u00a0 Jarabas's part in the transaction consisted in presenting the false and fraudulent accounts and vouchers, and in receiving the money therefor from the treasurer, Gonzaga.\u00a0 The method of procedure was as follows:\u00a0 An itemized account was made out, to which the name of Isidro Enabe was signed.\u00a0 This account was presented by Jarabas to Doctor Torres, the president of the board of health, and by him certified as correct.\u00a0 A municipal voucher was then prepared on a blank furnished by the government authorities, on which was a certificate of correctness purporting to have been signed by Ramos as municipal president.\u00a0 Gonzaga as municipal treasurer then certified that the expense represented by the account had been lawfully incurred under the authority of the municipal council, and that the voucher was payable out of a designated fund.\u00a0 On the voucher there was also a receipt for the amount claimed, purporting to be signed by Isidro Enabe.\u00a0 These vouchers were approved by the municipal council, paid, and the amounts thereof included by Gonzaga in his accounts-current with the Government.\u00a0 Upon the face of the voucher it appeared that the money was received by Isidro Ensibe, the person to whom the debt was asserted to be owing under the alleged contract with the municipality.\u00a0 The various documents were introduced in evidence, and the Government showed by Enabe that he never had a contract with the municipality to furnish rations, never presented or signed a bill or voucher, and never received any money from the municipality or anyone else in connection therewith.\u00a0 It appeared that while the matter was being investigated Enabe made a statement to like effect in the auditor's office, and that thereafter the defendant Jarabas went to the house of Enabe and told him that if he would testify that the documents were genuine he would be taken care\u00a0 of.<br\/><br\/>Doctor Torres, the president of the board of health, testified that he treated patients for cholera; that the poor who were quarantined were helped by the municipality, as he was informed by Jarabas, through the contractor Enabe.\u00a0 He never saw Enabe, and had no information with reference to the contract other than that obtained from Jarabas.\u00a0 The bill was presented for the approval of Doctor Torres by Jarabas, who at the time informed Torres that the statement had been signed by Enabe.\u00a0 It appears from the testimony of Doctor Torres and from the Chinaman Uy Cana that certain rice was in fact furnished, paid for by the municipality, and distributed among the poor who were quarantined.<br\/><br\/>No evidence was offered on behalf of the defendant.\u00a0 The evidence is undisputed that these documents were false, but there is nothing to show that Jarabas had any part in their preparation.\u00a0 It does appear, however, from his statement that the account and receipt had been signed by Enabe, and from his attempt to induce Enabe to testify falsely with reference to the fact that he knew that the documents were not genuine.\u00a0 No other reasonable conclusion can be drawn from all the circumstances and facts in evidence.<br\/><br\/>The documents were false within article 300 of the Penal Code, and Jarabas was beyond any reasonable doubt guilty of knowingly using them for the purpose of gain, in violation of article 302 of the Penal Code, which provides that\u2014<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"He who shall knowingly present in judicial proceedings, or should use with intent to gain, a false document of the kind mentioned in the preceding articles, shall be punished with the penalty lower by two degrees than that prescribed for the falsifier.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>The conviction of Jarabas is therefore affirmed, but the sentence is modified, and he is sentenced to two months and one day of <i>arresto mayor<\/i>, with the accessory penalties, and to pay a fine of P250, and in the event of insolvency to suffer subsidiary imprisonment for the time and in the manner prescribed\u00a0 by law.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

The Roman Catholic Apostolic Church in Porto Rico<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\"> [1]<sub><\/sub> <\/sup>(October term, 1907), (6 Off. Gaz., 1213) held, in a case in which the facts were very similar to the facts in the various abovecited cases, under laws analogous to the laws in force in the Philippine Islands, relating to the property of the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church, that said church <i>had not only a right to the possession of its church edifices, but was the lawful owner of the same.<\/i><br\/><br\/>In the case of The Roman Catholic Apostolic Church et al. <i>vs<\/i>. The Municipality of Placer (11 Phil. Rep., 315) the facts therein being very analogous to the facts in the present case, this court followed the said decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, holding that, under the Spanish law heretofore existing in these Islands, and the provisions of the treaty of Paris, the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church is the owner of the church buildings, convents, and cemeteries and the municipalities wherein the same are situated have no right of ownership therein by reason of funds or lands contributed for the foundation or erection thereof.<br\/><br\/>Our attention has not been called to any express grant or grants of land by the Crown of Spain for the purposes of the church upon which particular churches were erected, and it is believed that, during the early history of the sovereignty of Spain in the Indies, no such grants can be found, but no fact is better established in both secular and ecclesiastical history than the fact that the Crown of Spain and the Pope always cooperated from the very earliest history of the possession of the Indies in the extension of the great benefits offered by the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church to the <i>Indio<\/i>, as well as to the peoples of Europe.\u00a0 If any difference whatever existed in the efforts thus made in the great interest which the church took in the different peoples, it was in favor of the <i>Indio<\/i>.\u00a0 Scarcely had the Indies been discovered until the Pope and the Crown of Spain began to manifest a deep interest in the religious and educational welfare of the people of the Indies.\u00a0 (<i>Bula de<\/i> Alejandro VI of the 4th of May, 1493:\u00a0 also the <i>Bula<\/i> of the Kith of December, 1501; Ordenanza 5 (<i>a<\/i>) <i>por el Consejo de Las Indias<\/i>, 1575; law 10, title 1, book 1 of the Laws of the <i>Indias<\/i>, of the 1st of June, 1574; law 14, title 2, book 1 of the Laws of the <i>Indias<\/i>, and many others, the collection of which may be found in vol. 7 of <i>Legislacion Ultramarina<\/i>, p. 476.)<br\/><br\/>From the reading of these various <i>Bulas<\/i> and royal decrees and <i>ordenanzas<\/i>, it will be seen that the Government and the church were constantly working together for the advancement of the religious and educational welfare of the <i>Indios<\/i>.\u00a0 The Government lent its most enthusiastic support to the efforts that were made by the church in this regard, even to the extent of paying out of the public exchequer, funds, together with funds contributed by the <i>encomenderos<\/i> and the people of the pueblos, for the purpose of erecting the magnificent Catholic churches existing everywhere throughout the Spanish island possessions.\u00a0 While the Crown of Spain always reserved a certain control over the operations of the Catholic Church, yet no one can doubt that, when these <i>lands<\/i> were donated or designated and the church edifices were erected thereon, it was the intention of the Crown that such lands and such edifices should be devoted absolutely to the use of the church.\u00a0 It is a well-known fact that, when a church edifice of the Roman Catholic Church was once accepted and dedicated for religious purposes, it thereafter could never be used for any other purpose.\u00a0 The Catholic Church certainly had a right to believe at least that, during the three hundred years or more that it occupied its churches in the Philippine Islands, without protest or objection on the part of the Crown of Spain, the Crown had intended at least that they should become the absolute owners of such properties.\u00a0 And no protest has been called to our attention during a time immemorial and no protest or objection by the different pueblos to the right of ownership which the church has exercised for from two to three hundred years over the properties upon which the edifices of the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church were erected.\u00a0 Not only is it believed that the Crown of Spain intended that the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church should exercise absolute dominion over such properties, but under the treaty of Paris the Government of the United States obligated itself to protect all such interests.\u00a0 The Roman Catholic Apostolic Church occupied the different properties in question in this case for a time so long that no one in the pueblos could remember when such properties were not occupied and used for the benefit of said church, until about the years 1896-1899. The occupancy of property for from two to three hundred years without protest of any kind whatever from the donors would seem at least to be sufficient time, in the absence of positive proof to the contrary, that such donation was made for the purpose of transferring to the donee all rights and interests in such property.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, adhering to and following the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of The Municipality of Ponce <i>vs<\/i>.

Instance in this case contained two causes of action.\u00a0 In the first the plaintiff asked for judgment against the defendants in the sum of P2,100, with interest at the rate of 6 per cent from the 8th day of February, 1906.\u00a0 In the second the plaintiff asked for judgment in the sum of P296.80, with interest at the rate of 6 per cent from the 21st day of June, 1906.\u00a0 The plaintiff also prayed that he be given the right to retain the possession of the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">lorcha <\/span>repaired by him until\u00a0 the full amount of the two sums (P2,100 and P296.80) be paid by the defendants.<br\/><br\/>After hearing the evidence adduced during the trial, the lower court rendered a judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants for the sum of P2,100, with interest at the rate of 6 per cent from the 8th day of February, 1906, and also for the further sum of P296.80, with interest at the rate of 6 per cent from the 21st day of June, 1906, and the costs, also declaring that the plaintiff might retain the possession of said <i>lorcha<\/i> until the full amounts of said judgments with interest had been paid.<br\/><br\/>The defendants in the lower court presented a counter-claim.\u00a0 The said court found that the facts did not justify the claim made by the defendants against the plaintiff in the said counterclaim.<br\/><br\/>The claims of the plaintiff against the defendants were based upon the following facts:<br\/><br\/>First.\u00a0 That on or about the 27th of December, 1905, the plaintiff and the defendants entered into a verbal contract by which the plaintiff was to make certain repairs upon the <i>lorcha Dolores<\/i>, by virtue of the terms of which contract the plaintiff was to furnish the labor and material.\u00a0 The record does not disclose that at the time the said contract was made there was any stipulated amount agreed upon for such labor and material.\u00a0 Between the 27th day of December, 1905, and the 8th day of February, 1906, the plaintiff made such repairs upon the\u00a0 said <i>lorcha<\/i> under and by virtue of the terms of the contract as the defendants indicated and requested.\u00a0 On the latter date (the 8th of February, 1906) the plaintiff presented a bill to the defendants for the labor and material used in repairing the said <i>lorcha<\/i> amounting to P4,500.\u00a0 To the amount of this bill the defendants made some objection and it was then and there mutually agreed between the plaintiff and the defendants that the amount of said bill should be reduced to P3,600.\u00a0 After the parties had agreed that the labor and material furnished by the plaintiff were worth P3,600, the defendants paid to the plaintiff, on different dates, the sum of P1,500, leaving a balance of P2,100.<br\/><br\/>Later, on or about the 11th of June, 1906, the plaintiff and the defendants entered into another contract for additional repairs upon the said <i>lorcha<\/i>, by which the plaintiff was to furnish the labor and material.\u00a0 Under this second contract, the labor and material furnished for repairs amounted to the sum of P296.80.\u00a0 The labor and material under the second contract were\u00a0 furnished and the repairs completed on or about the 21st of June, 1906, and the plaintiff then demanded his pay for such labor and material.<br\/><br\/>After the <i>lorcha<\/i> was repaired in accordance with the contract, it was turned over to the defendants by the plaintiff, without any objection on the part of the defendants as to the class of material used or the character of the work done.<br\/><br\/>It appears from the record that some time after the defendants had accepted the said <i>lorcha<\/i> and had used it on two or more occasions, it began to take in water.\u00a0 No complaint, however, was made by the defendants concerning the leakage until after the plaintiff insisted upon the payment of the balance of his account.<br\/><br\/>The theory of the defendants in their defense is that the plaintiff, in making said repairs, guaranteed that the said <i>lorcha<\/i> should not take in water.\u00a0 The defendants alleged that the amount to be paid under the first contract was the sum of P3,300 and under the second contract the sum of P250.\u00a0 The fact, however, that the defendants agreed after the work was completed to pay the sum of P3,600, under the first contract, and the sum of P296.80, under the second contract, fully refutes this contention of the defendants as to the amounts which should be paid.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the contention of the defendants that the plaintiff should make the repairs and furnish the material therefor under a guaranty that said <i>lorcha<\/i> should not leak, we are of the opinion and so hold that the record brought to this court does not justify the contention of the defendants.\u00a0 Even if the plaintiff did guarantee that the labor and material should be furnished in a way so as to prevent the said <i>lorcha<\/i> when completed from leaking, the record clearly shows that said <i>lorcha<\/i> did not leak until after it had been used two or three times by the defendants, which leakage might have been due to some other cause than defective labor and material furnished by the plaintiff.\u00a0 Moreover, the record shows that, under the contract, the defendants claimed the right to indicate to the plaintiff what parts or portions of the old <i>lorcha<\/i> should be taken out and substituted by new pieces or parts.\u00a0 The plaintiff contends that, if said <i>lorcha<\/i> leaked at all after it had been used two or three times by the defendants, it was due to the old and defective pieces which the defendants insisted\u00a0 upon leaving in the said <i>lorcha<\/i>.\u00a0 The fact that the defendants insisted upon indicating just what repairs should be made by the plaintiff to the said <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">lorcha <\/span>is inconsistent with any guaranty such as the defendants\u00a0 claim was made by the plaintiff,\u00a0 the defendants make no contention that, at the time they accepted the <i>lorcha<\/i> after\u00a0 said repairs had been made, it was accepted under the condition\u00a0 that the same should be tried for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not the repairs had been made in accordance with the terms of the alleged contract.<br\/><br\/>In view of all the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause in the court below, we are of the opinion and so hold that the judgment of the lower court should be affirmed, with costs.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C, J., Torres, Carson<\/i>, and <i>Willard, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><\/div>",

the said land is bounded on the northeast by the property of Ambrosio Cariquitan, heirs of Nicasio Aguirre and Jacinto Buenagala; on the southeast by that of Ramon Mortera y Javier Camatcho; on the southwest by Calle Washington, and on the northwest by Calle Taft; said land has an area of 4,545 square meters, and appears more fully described in the plan and specifications attached to the petition as Exhibit 1, and made a part thereof.<br\/><br\/>At the last assessment the property with the improvements thereon was assessed at P1,818, and according to the best knowledge and belief of the petitioner no incumbrance of any kind exists upon it, nor does any person consider himself entitled thereto or possessing any interest therein; the property is now occupied by the said Benedicto Martinez, Maria Dianquina, Macario Fornilosa, Pablo Cacatian, Isidro Martinez, Sebastian Martinez, and Exequiela Bu\u00f1i.<br\/><br\/>The property was purchased by the petitioner on the 23d of May, 1907, from Inocente Martinez y Ticson for the sum of Pl,306, by means of an instrument drawn up by Francisco Godinez y Galan, his attorney in fact and legal representative, before the notary Joaquin Rodriguez Serra; said instrument was duly recorded in the registry of deeds of La Laguna under No. 332, entry No. 44, volume 3 of the municipality of San Pablo, La Laguna, on the 24th of May of said year, the vendor, Inocente Martinez, reserving the right to redeem or repurchase the property for the same price and conditions within a period of forty days counted from said date until the 2d of July,\u00a0 1907.\u00a0 It was stipulated in the said instrument that if the period for redemption should expire without the vendor availing himself of his right to repurchase the sale to the petitioner would become finally consummated and irrevocable.<br\/><br\/>The term agreed upon expired without the vendor or his agent availing themselves of the right of repurchase, so the registrar of La Laguna, at the request of the petitioner, recorded the confirmation of the ownership in his favor under entry No. 339 of book 2, folios 181 and 182, on the 5th day of July, 1907.\u00a0 Various documents relating to the petition were attached thereto and numbered from 1 to 9.<br\/><br\/>After the foregoing petition was presented, and due summons had been served on the owners of the adjoining lands and other interested parties, Inocente Martinez and Exequiela Buni opposed the registration asked for.\u00a0 On the 5th of July, 1908, Jose de Guzman set forth in writing that by means of a public instrument, ratified on August 20, 1907, before the notary Williams, the exponent had sold to Ramon Mortera y Javier Camatcho the land sought to be registered in these proceedings, for which reason the latter is the sole proprietor of the said property, and the decree granting the registration of the land should properly be made in favor of Mortera, and that his name should be substituted from said date as the petitioner in this case.\u00a0 In support of his averment he offered in evidence the bill of sale appearing at folio 56 of the record as Exhibit H.<br\/><br\/>By a writing dated June 9, 1908, Inocente Martinez stated that he objected to the registration applied for by Jose de Guzman on the ground that, according to the power of attorney granted to Francisco Godinez, the latter was not authorized by his principal to sell the property with <i>pacto de retro<\/i> unless within the legal term established by article 1508 of the Civil Code; that the said agent exceeded his authority, in violation of article 1714 of the said code, and in consequence the sale with right to repurchase made by said Godinez to the petitioner Guzman is null and void, since he caused him great loss in selling the property, inasmuch as the same is already sold under <i>pacto de retro<\/i> to Exequiela Bu\u00f1i; that he had received offers to purchase it for the sums of P3,500 and P4,500, but he had not accepted them and was awaiting a better price; therefore he prayed the court to consider him as an opponent, to appoint a day for the trial of the case, to deny the registration applied for, to hold that the instrument of sale under <i>pacto de retro<\/i> was null and void, and to decree the registration of the building lot or land in question in favor of the opponent with costs against the petitioner.<br\/><br\/>By a writing of the same date Exequiela Bu\u00f1i opposed the registration asked for on the ground that said lot had been sold to her with <i>pacto de retro<\/i> for a period of six years from March, 1904, as shown by the bill of sale executed by Inocente Martinez in her favor; she therefore prayed that the registration be denied.<br\/><br\/>At the trial of the case on August 8, 1908, counsel for the petitioner objected to the admission of the opposition of Exequiela Bu\u00f1i inasmuch as the latter did not allege the possession of any right, title, or interest in the property in question; that said opposition had not been sworn to as provided by law; and that it was\u00a0 not alleged therein that the person subscribing was duly authorized to sign the written opposition, or to take the prescribed oath.\u00a0 To this the counsel for the opponent answered that the latter had sworn and complied with all the requisites of the law.<br\/><br\/>At the hearing of the case, counsel for Martinez amended his written opposition, and set forth that Francisco Godinez, in making use of the power of attorney granted him, exceeded his authority by selling the property with <i>pacto de retro<\/i> for a period of forty days; that the property, at the time when the sale was carried out, was in\u00a0 course of litigation between the municipality of San Pablo as plaintiff and Martinez as defendant, to decide the question of ownership, and that the sale was effected without regard to the provisions of article 1291, paragraph 4, of the Civil Code; for said reason the sale could be rescinded a,nd was void.\u00a0 The trial court overruled the petitioner's demurrer and the latter excepted.<br\/><br\/>Evidence was adduced by both parties to the suit and their exhibits were made of record.\u00a0 After the trial, the court rendered judgment on the 22d of Au gust, 1908, denying the registration applied for by Jose de Guzman, substituted by Ramon Mortera, and sustaining the oppositions presented; after declaring a general default, the court decreed the adjudication and registration of the property described in the petition in favor of Inocente Martinez, subject to two mortgages, to wit, one for P1,306 in favor of the said Mortera for a period of forty days beginning on the 23d of May, 1907, already expired, and another for P500 in favor of Exequiela Buni for a period of six years from the 23d of March, 1904; the court further decreed that upon the judgment becoming final, the registrar of deeds of La Laguna should cancel all entries made in the old register relating to the said property.<br\/><br\/>On learning of the decision, the petitioner filed a motion before the court in bane praying that the decision of August 22 be vacated, the registration of the property in favor of the petitioner be granted, and that the oppositions presented be denied.\u00a0 On the 17th of September following the motion was heard by the court in bane and on the 21st day of said month judgment was rendered by the majority, dismissing the oppositions, and, after declaring a general default, ordering the adjudication and registration of said property in favor of the petitioner.\u00a0 This decision was rendered by W. L. Goldsborough, associate judge, and Juan Sumulong, acting associate judge.\u00a0 Judge S. del Rosario, presiding, wrote a dissenting opinion holding that the registration of the property should be decreed in the name of the opponent Martinez, with the incumbrances set out in his reversed decision of the 22d of August.<br\/><br\/>The above majority decision was excepted to by the opponents whose counsel moved for the reopening of the case on the ground that the judgment of the full court was contrary to the result of the evidence and to law; the motion was overruled on the 5th of October; the opponents excepted and filed a bill of exceptions, which was approved and submitted to this court.<br\/><br\/>No controversy has been raised by the parties with regard to the facts alleged in this case.\u00a0 The questions set up therein which are to be decided\u00a0 by this court are merely questions of law.<br\/><br\/>Have articles 1507 to 1520 of the Civil Code been repealed by Act No. 1108 of the Philippine Commission, and in consequence thereof have contracts of sale with <i>pacto de retro<\/i> been abolished, and with regard to the legal effects thereof have they been placed on the same footing as a loan contract secured by mortgage?\u00a0 This is the principal question discussed by the contending parties and set forth in the opposed decisions rendered in this case, one of which, the majority decision, is the one appealed from.<br\/><br\/>Section 6 of Act No. 1108, among other things, says:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"Section nineteen of said Act is further amended by adding after subsection (<i>d<\/i>) the following paragraph:<br\/><br\/>\" '(<i>e<\/i>) Instruments known as <i>pacto de retro<\/i>, made under sections fifteen hundred and seven and fifteen hundred and twenty of the Spanish Civil Code in force in these Islands, may be registered under this Act, and application for registration thereof may be made by the owner who executed the <i>pacto de retro<\/i> sale under the same conditions and in the same manner as mortgagors are authorized to make application for registration.' \"<\/blockquote><br\/>The amended section is section 19 of Act No. 496, touching registration of property in so far as said section 19 does not authorize the registration of the right to redeem, or to repurchase property sold with <i>pacto de retro<\/i>, inasmuch as the above paragraph (<i>e<\/i>) lays down as a rule that instruments of sale with that covenant, executed by virtue of articles 1507 and 1520 of the Civil Code in force, may be registered, according to said Act No. 1108, at the request of the owner who sold it with <i>pacto de retro<\/i>, under the same conditions and in the same manner as mortgages.<br\/><br\/>From neither the letter nor the spirit of the law, as contained in the above paragraph, can it be inferred in any manner whatsoever that the said articles and others of the Civil Code bearing on conventional repurchases have thereby been repealed.\u00a0 The language employed by the law-maker is clear and positive, and his intention and purpose are manifest; it can not possibly be deduced therefrom that he ever thought of abolishing or eliminating from the various forms of contracts and agreements recognized by and which are not contrary to law, good morals, or public order that of contract of sale with <i>pacto de retro<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>From the mere perusal of the said paragraph (e) of Act No. 1108 it is not possible to conclude that the articles of the Civil Code relating to contracts of sale with <i>pacto de retro<\/i> have been expressly or impliedly repealed; the law that is said to repeal them contains no words or conceptions annulling or repealing the articles of the Civil Code above referred to in formal and manifest terms, or at least it contains no provisions contrary to and incompatible with the prescriptions of the said articles.\u00a0 The provision that authorizes the registration of the instrument of sale with <i>pacto de retro<\/i> at the request of the owner of the realty is not incompatible with the prescriptions of the Civil Code.<br\/><br\/>Article 1510 of the Civil Code reads:<br\/><br\/>\"The vendor may bring his action against every possessor whose right arises from that of the vendee, even though in the second contract no mention should have been made of the conventional redemption; without prejudice to the provisions of the mortgage law with regard to third persons.\"<br\/><br\/>In the decision rendered in case No. 4737, Pandaquila <i>vs.<\/i> Gaza et al. (12 Phil. Rep., 663), it was held that, in accordance with the provision of the above-cited article\u2014<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"The seller of land has a right of action to enforce the redemption thereof as against any other possessor who derived his right from the purchaser under <i>pacto de retro<\/i>, inasmuch as said action is of the nature of a real right.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>Therefore, if the right to enforce the redemption is valid as against third persons it is unquestionable that the right of conventional redemption from which the former arises is of a real and not merely personal character.\u00a0 The registration of property sold with <i>pacto de retro<\/i> shows the coexistence of the right of the purchaser and of the vendor, the former as the temporary owner of the thing sold, and the latter as unquestionably entitled to again become the owner through the exercise of his right of action to enforce the redemption or purchase.\u00a0 The registration authorized by Act No. 1108, far from repealing the aforesaid articles of the Civil Code, has amplified the provisions of section 19 of Act No. 496 and the Mortgage Law in relation to such contracts, and recognizes the prescriptions of the Civil Code and especially the real character with which the right of redemption is clothed.<br\/><br\/>From the fact that instruments of sale with <i>pacto de retro<\/i> may be registered at the request of the owner selling, under the same conditions and in the same manner as mortgages, the repeal or abolition of the contract of sale with <i>pacto de retro<\/i> is not to be inferred from the language of the law, nor is this class of contracts placed on the same footing as mortgages.\u00a0 The two contracts are absolutely different in their nature and character, as may be seen from the mere perusal of articles 1507 et seq. and articles 1857 to 1862 and 1874 and following of the Civil Code.\u00a0 It was so understood and accepted in the decision rendered by this court in the case of Villarruel <i>vs.<\/i> Encarnacion (5 Phil. Rep., 360).<br\/><br\/>The registration of the land in favor of the applicant was refused by the dissenting judge, and a decree was issued for the entry of the property in the name of the opponent for the reason that the contract which appeared in the instrument of the 23d of May, 1907, is not one of sale with <i>pacto de retro<\/i>, but of loan secured by mortgage of the land said to have been sold, because articles 1507 and following of the Civil Code had been repealed by Act No. 1108, which excluded from the various contracts recognized by law that of sale with <i>pacto de retro<\/i>; but once it has been conclusively shown that there was no such repeal, and that that of purchase and sale with <i>pacto de retro<\/i> subsists, as well as the articles of the code that regulate the celebration, character, validity, and effects of the said form of contract, we must inquire whether Mortera's dominion over the land in question may be duly registered in accordance with the law on the subject.<br\/><br\/>According to the notarial instrument of July 22, 1907, Ramon Mortera y Javier acquired the land or building lot in question by purchase from Jose de Guzman, the owner, for the sum of Pl,500; the sale was recorded in the registry of property of La Laguna on the 27th of August, 1907.\u00a0 Jose de Guzman, the vendor, had previously acquired the said land from its former owner, Inocente Martinez y Ticson, by means of a contract of purchase and sale with <i>pacto de retro<\/i>, it being redeemable within forty days; this appears in the instrument of May 23, 1907, executed in his name by his attorney in fact, Francisco Godinez y Galan, according to the power of attorney granted to the latter by the said Martinez, and executed before a notary on the 6th of September, 1906.\u00a0 The term stipulated for the redemption having elapsed without the vendor or his agent having repurchased the land, its ownership became vested in the purchaser.\u00a0\u00a0 It was so entered in the registry, following the entry of registration of the said instrument of sale.<br\/><br\/>The above-mentioned acts and contracts by which the ownership of the property in question was transferred, the notarial documents executed by the contracting parties, together with the entries made in the registry, have not been impugned either criminally or civilly; on the contrary, the said documents have been admitted as being authentic and duly executed\u00a0 with all legal formalities.<br\/><br\/>As to the allegation that the land had been sold in violation of the provisions of article 1291, No. 4, of the Civil Code, being as it was the subject of litigation between the municipality of San Pablo and Martinez, it fulfills the purpose of this decision to state that by the judgment of March 2, 1907, rendered by the Court of First Instance of La Laguna prior to the first sale, it was held that the land in question was the property of the defendant, and he was therefore absolved of the complaint with the costs against the plaintiff municipality.<br\/><br\/>The instrument of the 23d of March, 1904, ratified before a notary on the 31st of December following, wherein it appears that Inocente Martinez sold what appears to be the same land with <i>pacto de retro<\/i> for 500 pesos to his sister-in-law, Exequiela Bu\u00f1i, has not been registered.\u00a0 In the articles of the partnership formed by the said Martinez and Francisco Godinez it appears among other things as corporate capital; and as the opponent, Bu\u00f1i, has not alleged further title to said land (which she admits to be owned by Martinez), than that arising from the said unregistered document, her opposition, like that of Inocente Martinez, can not, under the law, prevent the registration applied for.\u00a0 The land, as has been satisfactorily proven in this case, is the absolute property of Mortera.<br\/><br\/>Wherefore the decision rendered by the majority of the judges of the Court of Land Registration on the 21st of September, 1908, is hereby affirmed with the costs against the appellant; let this decision be communicated to the said court in order that action be taken in accordance with the law.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

H. Anderson was\u00a0 appointed a receiver to take possession of all the property of one of the defendants (the Casa Comision, a mercantile association organized under the provisions of the Code of Commerce) upon which plaintiff claimed to hold a mortgage for the security of its debt.\u00a0 On the same day Anderson qualified and entered upon the discharge of his duties.<br\/><br\/>On the 18th of April, 1907, while the original action was still pending in the court below, Cipriana Garganta filed a so-called complaint in intervention, under the provisions of section 121 of the Code of Civil Procedure, wherein she alleged that the above-mentioned receiver had used and occupied a certain house and lot, the property of the intervener, from the date of his appointment, May 10, 1904, until the 30th of September, 1904, of which the rental value during that period was not less than P470, and prayed that the receiver be ordered to show cause why he should not be directed to pay that amount to the intervener out of any funds in his hands as receiver.<br\/><br\/>To the intervener's complaint, the plaintiff corporation filed a general denial, and the receiver after denying all the allegations of intervener's complaint, except the fact that he had been appointed receiver, as alleged\u00a0 therein, expressly denied that he had used or occupied the house and lot of the intervener, and further denied all knowledge of any business relations which may have existed between the intervener and the Casa Comision of whose\u00a0 property he was receiver.<br\/><br\/>The trial court found that on the 10th of January, 1904, the Casa Comision, entered into a rental contract with the intervener, whereby it obligated itself to pay to the intervener, for a period of two years from the date of the contract, the sum of P100 monthly for the use and occupation of her house and lot; \"that the house and lot in question were occupied by the Casa Comision from the 10th day of May, 1904, until the 30th day of September of the same year;\" and that during that period the agreed monthly rental for the house and lot had not been paid.\u00a0 Upon these findings the court entered an order directing the receiver to pay to the intervener the sum of P466.66 from any funds of the Casa Comision in his hands, by virtue of his appointment as receiver.<br\/><br\/>We are of opinion that this order can not be sustained upon the facts admitted in the pleadings and found by the trial court, and that it should, therefore, be revoked and intervener's complaint dismissed.<br\/><br\/>It will be well at the outset to distinguish this case from the case of the International Banking Corporation <i>vs.<\/i> Corrales et al., Cho Han Ling, intervener (10\u00a0 Phil. Rep., 435).\u00a0 In that case, we sustained a right of intervention in the original action, brought here again on this appeal, in favor of a creditor who alleged and established one of the statutory rights of preference provided in article 1922 of the Civil Code\u00a0 with respect to certain specific property of the Casa Comision; and held that the intervener was entitled to a formal declaration of his statutory right, and to an order upon the receiver to recognize this right in the distribution of the proceeds of the sale of the specific property affected thereby.\u00a0 (Cf. Torres <i>vs.<\/i> Genato, 7 Phil. Rep., 204.)\u00a0 In the case at bar, however, while it is true that the trial court finds that the Casa Comision is indebted to the intervener on account of rent, and that article 1922 of the Civil Code secures to a landlord a preferential right, in certain cases, similar in character to that of the intervener in the former case, nevertheless this preference only exists as to property of the tenant found on the rented property; and nowhere in the allegations of the complaint in intervention, nor in the findings of the trial court, is it intimated that any of the property of the Casa Comision in the hands of the receiver was found in or on the property of the intervener, or that the intervener has any statutory right of preference, under the provisions of the above- mentioned article, with respect to any of the property of the Casa\u00a0 Comision in the hands of the receiver.\u00a0 Hence, so far as the intervener's claim has its origin in the rental contract made with the Casa Comision, she is merely a general unsecured creditor, and her right to intervener can not be\" maintained on the ground on which intervention was sanctioned in the former case, wherein the intervener alleged and established a preferential right in the distribution of the proceeds arising from the sale of some of the property in the hands of the receiver.<br\/><br\/>The ground upon which counsel for the intervener appears to have rested the prayer of her complaint in intervention was that the receiver in the performance of his duties as receiver, made use of\u00a0 the house and lot of the intervener in storing, guarding and preserving the property entrusted to his hands, and that she was, therefore, entitled to payment from any funds in the hands of the receiver of a reasonable sum\u00a0 for the use and occupation of the house and lot, such sum being properly chargeable to expenses incurred by the receiver in the performance of the duties of his office; and there can be no doubt that had she established the use and occupancy by the receiver for this purpose, she would be entitled to recover from him a reasonable compensation therefor.\u00a0 But the trial court found that the house and lot were occupied by the Casa Comision itself during the period for which compensation is demanded of the receiver; and this finding having been made upon the issue raised by the denials of intervened allegations that the house and lot were used and occupied by the receiver, it is clear that the order directing payment by the receiver can not be sustained on the theory of counsel for the intervener, that the expense incident to the alleged use and occupation by the receiver was an expense incurred by him in the performance of his duty to guard and preserve property entrusted to him, which was stored therein.<br\/><br\/>In the discussion of the case by the members of the court after it had been submitted, it was suggested that the theory upon which counsel for appellee rested her claim against the receiver was unnecessarily restricted, in that\u00a0 counsel apparently relied on the sole ground that the alleged use and occupation of intervened house and lot was for the purpose of storing and preserving property entrusted to his care; whereas he might have rested intervener's claim upon the broader doctrine laid down in High on Receivers (Third Edition, sees. 632 and 638 (a) and cases cited in foot notes), that \"the primary duty of a receiver of leasehold premises is to pay the head-rent or principal rent due the landlord of the premises, and this he is bound to do without any special order of the court to that effect, and without compelling the landlord to resort to any proceedings for the purpose of enforcing payment, and\u00a0 when the title to leasehold premises becomes vested in a receiver, who continues in possession of and sublets the same, the lessor may recover the rent in an action against the receiver;\" and that \"when receivers enter into possession of and receive the rents of real estate belonging to third\u00a0 persons not parties to the cause, but which have been held by defendants under lease, they may be required by petition in the cause in which they were appointed to pay to the owners the rent due thereon.\"<br\/><br\/>But notwithstanding the fact that the receiver in this case was appointed for all the property of the receiver, it must not be forgotten that as such receiver he had the right, subject to the order of the court, to elect whether he would perform the executory contracts entered into by the company or corporation whose estate he represents, prior to the receivership (Russ Lumber, etc., Co. <i>vs.<\/i> Muscupiabe Land, etc., Co., 120 Cal.,\u00a0 521; 65 Am. St. Rep., 186; Spencer <i>vs.<\/i> World's Columbian Exposition, 163 111., 117; Comra. <i>vs.<\/i> Franklin Ins. Co., 115 Mass., 278; Scott <i>vs.<\/i> Rainier Power,\u00a0 etc., Co., 13 Wash., 108) ; since no preexisting contracts are binding on a receiver unless adopted by him (Central Trust Co. <i>vs.<\/i> East Tennessee Land Co., 79 Fed. Rep., 19; General Electric Co. <i>vs.<\/i> Whitney (C. C. A.), 74 Fed. Rep., 664; United Electric Securities Co. <i>vs.<\/i> Louisiana Electric Light Co., 71 Fed. Rep., 615; Central Trust Co. <i>vs.<\/i> Marietta, etc., R. Co., 51 Fed. Rep., 15, following Southern Express Co. <i>vs.<\/i> Western North Carolina R. Co., 99 U.

Co., 115 Mass., 278; Scott <i>vs.<\/i> Rainier Power, etc., Co., 13 Wash., 108); and that while a receiver may as a rule adopt the provisions of an executory contract for the benefit of the receivership, it is his duty to refuse to adopt a contract which would prove so burdensome as\u00a0 to imperil the fund.\u00a0 (General Electric\u00a0 Co. <i>vs.<\/i> Whitney (C. C. A.), 74 Fed. Rep., 664; Central Trust Co. <i>vs.<\/i> East Tennessee Land Co., 79 Fed. Rep., 19; United Electric Securities Co. <i>vs.<\/i> Louisiana Electric Light Co., 71 Fed.

Co., 100 Iowa, 39.\u00a0 And see Girard L. Ins., etc., Co. <i>vs.<\/i> Cooper (C. C. A.), 51 Fed. Rep., 332.)\u00a0 Manifestly, therefore, a receiver of an individual or corporation does not by reason merely of his appointment become liable on existing contracts.\u00a0 (Empire. Distilling Co. <i>vs.<\/i> McNulta (C. C. A.), 77 Fed. Rep., 700; Minneapolis Baseball Co. <i>vs.<\/i> City Bank, 74 Minn., 98; Nelson <i>vs.<\/i> Kalkhoff, 60 Minn., 305); the doctrine as stated by High being as follows:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"As a\u00a0 rule, receivers are not liable upon the covenants of the persons over whose effects they are appointed, but become liable solely by reason of their own acts.\u00a0 And receivers who have been appointed over a corporation, and who have accepted the trust and taken possession of the assets, do not thereby become liable for rent of the premises held by the company under a lease; nor can they be held liable until they elect to take possession of the premises or until the doing of some affirmative act which in law would be equivalent to such an election.\"\u00a0 (High on Receivers, Third\u00a0 Edition, sec. 273; Commonwealth <i>vs.<\/i> Franklin Ins. Co., 115 Mass., 278; Gaither <i>vs.<\/i> Stockbridge, 67 Md., 222.)<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>It is very clear, therefore, that the finding by the trial court that the property in question was\u00a0 occupied by the Casa Comision and not by the receiver defeats the intervener's right to recover on this theory of the receiver's liability as effectively as on the theory advanced by her counsel on appeal.<br\/><br\/>The trial court, however, while it did not sustain the allegations of the intervener as to the use and occupation by the receiver,\u00a0 appears to have been of opinion that since proof of occupation of intervener's property\u00a0 by the Casa Comision, under the rental contract, established intervener's right to recover from the Casa Comision, and since all the property of the Casa Comision was in the hands of the receiver, the intervener should have an order upon the receiver for the payment of the proven indebtedness of the Casa Comision out of any funds in his hands as receiver.\u00a0 In this the trial court erred.\u00a0 We do not question the right of the intervener in a proper action to reduce to judgment her claim of indebtedness against the Casa Comision, and to enforce that judgment against its property in a proper proceeding, but she had no right, and indeed she does not appear to have attempted to intervene in this action for the purpose of securing an adjudication of her claim against her debtor, the Casa Comision, and thereafter to have an order directing the payment of the claim thus adjudicated, out of the funds in the hands of the receiver, without regard to the priorities of other claimants upon the same funds; the effect of the order is to give a general unsecured creditor a preference in the payment of his claim over other creditors with a specific lien on the property out of which the unsecured creditor is to be paid.\u00a0 The reasoning in the Cho Han Ling intervention (<i>supra<\/i>) and in the so-called Tan Tonco cases (Bonaplata <i>vs.<\/i> Ambler, 2 Phil. Rep., 392; Encarnacion <i>vs.<\/i> Ambler, 3 Phil, Rep., 623) clearly denies to general unsecured creditors the right of intervention in an action wherein the property of the common debtor has been committed to the hands of a receiver, both because whatever interest a general unsecured creditor may be said to have in the outcome of a suit brought by another creditor against the same debtor, it is clear that it does not constitute such an interest in the matter in litigation or in the success of either party as is contemplated by section 121 of the Code of Civil Procedure; and\u00a0 because, to permit unsecured creditors to intervene under such circumstances, while the receiver guards the property for the benefit of all, would render the prohibition of bankruptcy proceedings' meaningless.\u00a0 (Sec. 524, Code of Civil Procedure.)<br\/><br\/>It may not be improper to point out that since the intervention in this action was originally permitted for the purpose of asserting an alleged liability of the receiver, this decision does not in any wise limit or deny the right of the intervener to institute a separate action against the Casa Comision, and in the event of a judgment in her favor, to take such steps as she may see fit for the purpose of recovering her judgment out of the property of her debtor.\u00a0 And while it is\u00a0 not necessary for the purposes of this decision to indicate the methods by which the latter end may be\u00a0 obtained, our decisions in the cases of Torres <i>vs.<\/i> Genato (<i>supra<\/i>) and of the intervention of Cho Han Ling (<i>supra<\/i>) and the doctrine laid down in the case of Peterson <i>vs.<\/i> Newberry (6 Phil Rep., 260) clearly indicate that a way may be found whereby she can assert whatever right of preference in the distribution of the proceeds of the sale of the property of her debtor she, as a judgment creditor, may be entitled to, under the provisions of article 1924 of the Civil Code.<br\/><br\/>The order of the lower court should be and is hereby revoked and judgment will be entered against the intervener upon the complaint in intervention in the court below.\u00a0 No costs will be allowed either party on this appeal.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

he produced the registration of the <i>hacienda<\/i>, owned by the said hospital, entered in the old registry of property.<br\/><br\/>After the hearing of the case, the Court of Land Registration rendered the following decision:<br\/><blockquote>\"The adjudication and registration of the\u00a0 property described in the <i>expediente<\/i> in favor of Tomas Guison y Salcedo and of his wife Juana Mariano is hereby decreed.\u00a0 Upon the decision becoming final, let the decree be issued, and let the registrar for the city of Manila cancel the\u00a0 entry with reference to said property and in favor of the applicant, Tomas Guison y Salcedo, which appears at folio 489 and previous folios of volume 47 of the Quiapo section, and 91 of the archives, property No. 2324, 1st entry.\u00a0 At the same time, let the entry be partially canceled which refers to the property in question, consisting of 457.60 square meters, and which forms\u00a0 part of what is known as the <i>Hacienda de Mayhaligue<\/i>, pertaining to the San Lazaro Hospital, which appears in favor of the hospital of the same name at folio 109 of volume 20 of the Quiapo section and 44 of the archives, property No. 1214, 1st entry.\"\u00a0 (B. of E., 6 and 7.)<br\/><\/blockquote>The legal foundations of the decision are as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"That, as the possession of said real property was recorded on the 10th of July, 1895, in favor of Fernanda Felisa Corrales, and was likewise recorded in favor of the San Lazaro Hospital of this city on the 5th of November of the same year, in accordance with article 393 of the Mortgage Law, now in force, the registrar should have suspended the record of the possessory information in favor of the San Lazaro Hospital, entered a cautionary notice, if so requested by the interested party and transmitted a copy of said entry to the court which approved such information, in<br\/>order that, after complying with the provisions of the said article, it might confirm or revoke the order approving the instrument to be recorded, subject to the prior record of the other instrument relating to the same property.<br\/><br\/>\"That, even though the inscription made of the <i>hacienda<\/i> of the San Lazaro Hospital was one of ownership, it should not at all events have been made under article 17 of the said Mortgage Law, according to which, after any instrument transferring the ownership or <i>possession<\/i> of realty, or of property rights thereto, has been recorded or a cautionary notice thereof made in the registry, as occurs with regard to the possession of Fernanda Felisa Corrales, which was acquired from the person who, like Jose and Ciriaca Garcia, had the same recorded, no other instrument of the same or of a previous date could be recorded or noted by which the ownership of the same estate or property right is transferred or encumbered.<br\/><br\/>\"That, under the provisions of the common law, the applicant has won by prescription the ownership of the thing so possessed, inasmuch as he has been in possession of the realty for more than twelve years, his possession being computed with that enjoyed by his ancestors, acquired by a just title such as is the instrument of purchase and sale by virtue of which it was transferred to Fernanda Felisa Corrales, and possessed with good faith, which is always presumed in the possessor!<br\/><br\/>\"And finally, that in connection\u00a0 with the ownership of the realty which is the subject of the opposition, a final judgment has been rendered by the Court of First Instance of Manila between the same parties who are now contending, and said judgment is now <i>res adjudicata<\/i> between the said parties and their successors.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The representative of the Insular Government has appealed from the\u00a0 said judgment, and his appeal has been submitted to this court.\u00a0 He assigned as the only cause of error the fact that the court below adjudicated to the petitioner the land that was the subject of his own application.\u00a0 He based his claim of error on the allegation that the possessory information instituted by Jose and Ciriaca Garcia and recorded in the registry of property was null and void by reason of fraud committed by the said interested parties in failing to summon the San Lazaro Hospital as an adjoining owner to the realty claimed by them; that, had it not been for said omission, the result would have been the opposition of the San Lazaro Hospital to their pretended possession of the said parcel which is but a portion of the <i>hacienda<\/i> owned by the hospital; that only by such means has it been possible to justify their adverse possession, and obtain the judicial approval of the possessory information which was the basis of all the ulterior transfers of ownership that constitute the claim of title now presented by the applicant to the new registry of property.<br\/><br\/>This cause of error can not be alleged in this instance, for the reason that this question was\u00a0 not raised in the lower court.<br\/><br\/>But, even had this been done, the allegation could not have been sustained, for the reason that suits for cancellation of title can not be instituted against third persons who have recorded the instruments evidencing their respective interests.\u00a0 (Mortgage Law, 36.)\u00a0 And it has not been proven that Felisa Corrales or the subsequent holders were parties to the fraud attributed to the Garcias, the first grantors.\u00a0 (Mortgage Law, art. 37, par.2 subd. 2.)\u00a0 And after they have been recorded, instruments or contracts executed or covenanted by a person who, according to the registry, has a right thereto, shall not be invalidated with regard to third persons, although the right of the person executing them be annulled or terminated later by virtue of a prior deed not recorded, or for reasons which do not clearly appear from the same registry.\u00a0 (Id. 34.)<br\/><br\/>There being no other ground for the appeal, the judgment of the lower court is hereby affirmed with the costs of this instance against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson<\/i>, and <i>Willard, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><\/div>",

No. 4998, October 25, 1909<\/h2>\n<h3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, <i>VS.<\/i> JOSE SEDANO Y CALONGE, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>CARSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">Appellant was convicted in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila of the crime of libel, as defined and penalized in Act\u00a0 No. 277 of the Philippine Commission, and sentenced to three months' imprisonment and to pay a fine of P1,000, Philippine currency, and the costs of the proceedings.<br\/><br\/>The alleged libelous matter appeared in an article bearing as its title the words \"A Portrait, Dedicated to the Filipino People, and Especially to the People of Cavite,\" which was published on or about the 3d day of May, 1908, in the city of Manila, in a weekly\u00a0 publication known as \"Chispazos.\"<br\/><br\/>At the trial in the court below, defendant and his counsel admitted in writing that defendant, as editor and proprietor of that periodical, published, printed, and circulated the issue which contained the alleged libelous matter; and the evidence of record conclusively establishes the allegation of the prosecution that the person referred to in the alleged libelous article, and whose character, reputation, and standing in the community are assailed therein, is the Hon. Rafael Palma, now a member of the United States Philippine Commission, and at the time when the article was published a Delegate to the Philippine Assembly from the Province of Cavite.<br\/><br\/>That the article in question was \"an injurious publication\" which impeached the honesty, virtue, and reputation of the person against whom it was directed, and tended to expose him to public hatred, contempt, and ridicule by publishing to the world his alleged mental, moral, and physical defects, is not and can not be questioned; and counsel for the appellant rests his argument on appeal, solely and exclusively on his contention that the evidence of record discloses that the matter charged as libelous is true, and was published \"with good motives and for justifiable ends,\" and that appellant should, therefore, be acquitted under the provisions of section 4 of the Libel Law (Act No. 277).<br\/><br\/>But one witness was called by the defense, whose testimony, so far as it bears upon the truth or falsity of the statements made in the defamatory article, is practically limited to a relation of certain political differences between the witness and the subject of the article, whom the witness specifically charged with having violated a political compact, whereby, as witness claims, mutual assistance was to be rendered in the political campaign incident to the last general election of members of the Philippine Assembly.<br\/><br\/>The trial judge was of opinion that \"the most\" that \"could be claimed' for this evidence was that it disclosed a misunderstanding between the parties to the quarrel; and even if it be admitted that the uncontradicted testimony of this witness would sustain a finding that the subject of the article had failed, for some reason unknown and not indicated by the witness, to fulfill the terms of a certain political compact entered into\u00a0 with the witness, nevertheless such a finding would fail utterly to sustain defendant's allegations of the truth of the defamatory article, which traduces the physical, mental, and moral qualities of the injured party, asperses his reputation and standing in both public and private life, impugns his professional attainments, ability, and conduct as an attorney, and by direct imputation as well as by insinuation and veiled suggestion, charges him with grave offenses defined and penalized in the Penal Code.<br\/><br\/>No evidence whatever was submitted at the trial in support of defendant's contention that the defamatory matter was published with justifiable motives; but counsel on appeal insists that it appearing that the subject of the article was a member of the Philippine Assembly, and a candidate for reelection and for appointment to the Philippine Commission at the time when it was published, comment and criticism upon his conduct, and upon his mental, moral, and physical fitness for the offices for which he was an aspirant might lawfully be made by the public press, and that in the absence of proof of actual malice, such comment and criticism should be presumed to have been made for justifiable motives.<br\/><br\/>But while it may be admitted that the public acts of public men may lawfully be made the subject of comment and criticism by the public and by the press and that such criticism, when made in good faith, should be and is privileged; and while it may, perhaps, also be admitted that a somewhat broad license should be allowed to criticisms of and comment on the mental, moral, and physical fitness of candidates for public office, the very fact of candidacy putting these matters in issue, and the public having a right to be informed as to the qualifications of those who seek election, and perhaps appointment to public office, nevertheless it is clear upon general principles as well as under the express provisions of the Libel Law (Act No. 277) that such comment or criticism, if defamatory in its nature, constitutes a criminal libel if it appears that it was actuated by actual or express malice; that from the very nature of the privilege claimed the freedom of such criticism is necessarily limited to <i>fair<\/i> comment on the matters under discussion, fair comment being comment which is true, or which, if false, expresses the real opinion of the author, such opinion having been formed with a reasonable degree of care and on reasonable grounds.\u00a0 (Steph. Dig.\u00a0 Cr. Law, art. 274); and that such criticism can not be permitted to be used as a cloak for malicious assaults on the private life and character of the person criticised..<br\/><br\/>A mere reading\u00a0 of the article in question is sufficient to sustain a finding that its publication was inspired by actual or express malice, and the trial court properly found that it bears upon its face \"plain evidence of a <i>purposed calumny and furious malice<\/i>.\"\u00a0 We do not deem it necessary or proper to give such an article further publicity by setting it out in this opinion, and it is sufficient for our purposes to say that the vile and insulting epithets with which it abounds, the manifest vindictiveness with which it assails the family, social, professional, and political relations of the injured person, and the reckless manner in which it imputes the commission of grave crimes and misdemeanors, which the defendant did not even attempt to prove at the trial, although he undertook to justify by offering evidence as to the truth of other portions of the defamatory matter contained in the article, leave no room for doubt of the animus in the mind of the author.<br\/><br\/>It need hardly be added that such an article can not be said to have been limited to fair comment and criticism of the public conduct of the public official assailed, or of his qualifications and capacity as a candidate for office, and that, its author should not and can not be permitted to shield himself, by claiming\u00a0 that the publication was made with justifiable motives, from the consequences to himself entailed by his malicious assaults on the public and private life of his victim.<br\/><br\/>Moreover the grounds of public policy upon which the so-called privilege of \"fair criticism\" of the public acts of public officers, and of directing public attention to the character and qualifications or lack of qualifications of candidates for office is based, by no means justify or necessitate the extension of the privilege to false and unfounded allegations of fact.\u00a0 The interests of society require that immunity\u00a0 should be granted to the discussion of public affairs, and that all acts and matters of a public nature may be freely published with fitting comments and strictures; but they do not require that the right to criticise the public acts of public officers shall embrace the right to base such criticisms upon false statements of fact, or to attack the private character of the officer, or to falsely impute to him malfeasance or misconduct in office; and as to candidates for office it has frequently been held in the United States that false allegations of fact even when made in good faith and with probable cause are not privileged (59 Fed., Rep., 530; 21 Fla., 431; 136 Mass., 164; 36 S. W. Rep. (Texas), 765;\u00a0 6Q Mich., 307; 69 Pa., 103; 42 N. S. Rep. (N. Y.), 270); although it has also been held that where there is an honest belief in the truth of charges made against candidates for office, and the publication is made in good faith and with probable cause one is not responsible even for publishing an untruth (46 la., 533; 64 Tex., 354; 111 Pa., 404), and the latter view is that held by\u00a0 Bishop, who asserts that this \"is believed to be the better doctrine\" in reason as well as as in authority.\u00a0 (Bishop's Crim. Law, Vol. II, \u00a7 936.)<br\/><br\/>For the purposes of this opinion, however, it is not necessary to discuss this latter question, or the distinction usually drawn in this connection between candidates for elective and appointive offices, because in the case at bar the lack of proof of probable cause for the belief by the publisher of the article of the truth of the charges contained therein; the lack of good faith disclosed in the manifest recklessness and malicious vindictiveness with which the attack was made; and the utter failure of the attempt to justify by proving the truth of the numerous defamatory allegations of fact, leave no room for doubt as to the criminal liability of the defendant.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the appellant calls upon this court, by its decision in this case, to protect the freedom of speech and secure to the people of these Islands the liberty of the press which are guaranteed in the Philippine Bill.\u00a0 But while it is \"fundamental with us that the proper and open discussion of whatever concerns the public shall be free,\" and that \"the law of libel is never to be so administered as to impair the just liberty of the press\" (Bishop's Crim. Law, Vol. II, \u00a7 913), the provisions of the Constitution of the United States guaranteeing the liberty of the press, from which the provisions of the Philippine, Bill were adopted, have never been held to secure immunity to the person responsible for the publication of libelous defamatory matter in a newspaper, the right guaranteed consisting merely of a right to print what one chooses, without any previous license, but subject to be held responsible therefor in like manner as would anyone else be held responsible for a similar publication made in some other way.\u00a0 (Jones <i>vs.<\/i> Townsend, 21 Fla., 431; Giddens <i>vs.<\/i> Thirk, 4 Ga., 364; Sweeney <i>vs.<\/i> Baker, 13 W. Va., 158.)<br\/><br\/>We find no error in the proceedings prejudicial to the rights of the accused, and we are satisfied that the judgment of conviction of the trial court should be sustained.<br\/><br\/>We are unanimously of opinion, however, that the trial court erred on the side of leniency in imposing a sentence upon the convict, which, we think, is wholly inadequate in view of the gravity of the offense committed.\u00a0 The publication of falsehood and calumny against public officers or candidates for public office has frequently been held to be specially reprehensible and an offense most dangerous to the people and to the public welfare, because of the danger that the services of the best citizens may thereby be lost to the State (151 Mass., 50; 74 Tex., 89; 93 Ky., 347; 117 Pa., 520); and in the case at bar the offense is aggravated to a degree, not only by the form of the attack itself and the manner in which it was made public, but by the high and responsible nature of the duties performed\u00a0 by the official attacked and the dignity of both the office which he held at the time the libel was published and of the office for which he was at that time a candidate and to which he was later appointed.\u00a0 The libelous article occupies about four foolscap pages of typewritten matter, and every paragraph, and nearly every sentence, contains one or more distinct defamatory allegations of fact; and it would be difficult to conceive of a more wilfully and vindictively cruel, wicked, base, and dastardly attack upon the honor and integrity of a high public official and upon his private, family, social, and professional relations than that which is contained therein; it is couched in language so indecent, and abounds in indirections so vulgar, that it is not fit for publication in any respectable newspaper, and yet it was published in an illustrated weekly, which was spread broadcast through-out the Islands and sought especially to gain an entrance into the homes of the people of the city of Manila where its victim resided and of the Province of Cavite which he represented in the Philippine Assembly, and, finally as the trial court well found, the mere reading of the article not only discloses \"purposed calumny and furious malice,\" but a wanton and reckless attempt on the part of its publisher to inflict upon the victim of his malicious attacks the utmost pain and suffering and injury which could be caused by a scurrilous and libelous attack in the public press.<br\/><br\/>In view of all the circumstances of the case, we think that the penalty which should not fall far short of the maximum penalty prescribed by law, and we, therefore, modify the sentence imposed by the trial court, by substituting for so much thereof as imposes the penalty of three months' imprisonment and a fine of P1,000, the penalty of one year's imprisonment and a fine of P1,000, together with subsidiary imprisonment in accordance with law in the event of insolvency and failure to pay the fine, the subsidiary imprisonment, however, not to exceed one-third of the principal penalty; and thus modified, the sentence imposed by the trial court is affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

that this amount of P785.36 had been applied to the payment of the interest on said original contract.<br\/><br\/>On the 1st day of December, 1905, the defendant presented a motion asking that the said amended complaint be struck from the files, for the reason that it was not a proper reply to the answer of the defendant,\u00a0 which motion the court denied,<br\/><br\/>On the ist day of December, 1905, the defendant presented a demurrer to the said amended complaint, upon the ground that the complaint did not allege the period\u00a0 within which defendants were to pay the sum of the original contract of 3,000 pesos, which demurrer was also denied\u00a0 by the court.<br\/><br\/>On the 23d day of February, 1906, the defendant asked that the deposition of one Eduardo Montiel, who was then a prisoner in Bilibid, be taken, which motion was denied.<br\/><br\/>After hearing the evidence adduced during-the trial of the cause, the lower court rendered a judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant Eugenio Gutierrez, for the sum of P3,366.38.\u00a0\u00a0 The lower court found that the defendant had paid the sum of P747.03, at different times, which was applied upon the payment of interest.\u00a0 From this judgment of the lower court the defendant appealed, and made the following assignments of error:<br\/><br\/><blockquote><div style=\"text-align: center;\">\"I.<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"The court below erred in overruling the motion of the defendants of September 1, 1905, requesting that the reply of the plaintiff filed on the 29th of August, 1905, amending his original complaint of the 27th of February, 1905, be stricken from the record.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">\"II.<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"The court below erred in overruling the motion of September 1, 1905, requesting the dismissal of the complaint on the ground that the facts therein stated are not sufficient to constitute a cause of action.<br\/>\u00a0<br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">III.<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"The court below erred in overruling the motion of the defendants of February 23,\u00a0 1906, requesting that the testimony of Eduardo Montiel, who is confined in Bilibid Prison and therefore absent from the Province of Romblon, be taken by deposition, as they consider said witness an important one.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">\"IV.<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"The court below erred in sentencing the defendant Eugenio Gutierrez alone to pay the\u00a0 total amount of the debt, and dismissing the case, on account of lack of evidence, with respect to the other defendants, Feliciano Moreno and Leon Montana.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">\"V.<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"The court below erred in holding in its judgment that if the plaintiff signed the document offered in evidence by the defendant Gutierrez (Exhibit D of the defendants) in order to prove that the plaintiff had agreed to accept monthly payments of P30 until the debt was paid in full, he did so in ignorance of the contents of the instrument.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">\"VI.<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"The court below erred in holding in its judgment that such a stipulation as the one contained in the said document, Exhibit D of the defendants, to accept monthly payments of P30, is invalid for the reason that no obligating motive for said stipulation exists;

and moreover, under the provisions of section 361 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions, the defendant might have taken the deposition of the witness without the intervention\u00a0 of the court.\u00a0 Said section 361 provides the method for taking depositions of witnesses, when the same is permitted under section 355.\u00a0 It appears that the defendant, therefore, had not used due diligence in preparing himself for the trial of the cause, and furthermore the affidavit presented by the defendant does not attempt to show that the facts which he expected to prove by the witness Montiel could not have been proven by some other accessible witness.\u00a0 The defendant should have taken advantage of the provisions of section 361 prior to the time fixed for the trial of the cause, or have shown to the court that he had used due diligence in an effort to secure the presence of the said Montiel, and that he could not safely proceed to the trial of the cause without the presence of said witness or his deposition.\u00a0 It would appear that the effort of the defendant was simply to delay the trial of the cause.\u00a0 In our opinion, the court, under the circumstances, committed no error in refusing to delay the trial of the cause for the reasons stated by the defendant.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the fourth assignment of error, to wit, that the court committed an error in rendering a judgment against the defendant Eugenio Gutierrez alone, for the full amount of the debt, dismissing the case as to the other\u00a0 defendants, Leon Montana and Feliciano Moreno, the defendant contends that under the contracts the defendants were only liable for their proportionate share of the obligation, citing articles 1137 and 1138 of the Civil Code.\u00a0 It is true\u00a0 that under said articles of the Civil Code, where two or more persons are obligated in the same contract, and where there is nothing in the contract to the contrary, the parties are liable <i>pro rata<\/i> upon said contract; in other words, by virtue of the provisions of the Civil Code, where two or more persons sign a contract, in order that each shall be responsible for the full amount of the obligation, express words to that effect must be used.\u00a0 If two persons sign a contract under the provisions of the Civil Code, and no words are used to make each liable for the full amount, each is only liable for a proportionate amount of the contract.\u00a0 In the present case the contract was written in the following words:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"We, Feliciano Moreno, Eugenio Gutierrez, and Leon Monta\u00f1a, hereby acknowledge to have this day received from Bonifacio Pimentel the sum of <i>three thousand pesos<\/i> in silver coin, as a loan, which sum of money we three will use in business transactions, it having been agreed with the lender that said money will earn a premium or interest at the rate of 10 per cent per annum, that is to say we promise to pay <i>three hundred pesos<\/i> at the end of each year, and said amount will commence to bear interest from that date; likewise we agree that in case of an unexpected event our property is to serve as collateral.<br\/><br\/>\"In witness to the truth, we, together\u00a0 with the lender, sign this formal agreement\u00a0 in duplicate.<br\/><br\/>\"Romblon, March 20, 1901.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: right;\">(Signed)\u00a0 \"FELICIANO MORENO.<br\/>\"LEON GUTIERREZ<br\/>\"LEON MONTA\u00d1A.<br\/>\"BONIFACIO PIMENTEL.\"<\/div><\/blockquote><br\/>From a reading of the contract in question, it will be seen that it is <i>una obligacion mancomunada y no solidaria<\/i> and tha the three debtors are not liable separately for the payment of the full amount.\u00a0 They are each only liable for an aliquot part of the original obligation.\u00a0 (See articles 1137 and 1138, Civil Code.) The lower court therefore committed an error in rendering a judgment for the full amount against one of the, said codebtors.<br\/><br\/>It appears from an examination of the record that Eugenio Gutierrez had assumed all responsibility in relation to the contract.\u00a0 Not only by his answer does this fact appear, but by the alleged contract (Exhibit D) of December 1, 1904.\u00a0 He there assumes to make\u00a0 a contract for himself and for the other defendants.\u00a0 Under this contract and the\u00a0 pleadings filed in this cause, the defendant Gutierrez tried to assume all obligation in respect to the said original\u00a0 contract.\u00a0 The record shows that Leon Monta\u00f1a had died (the record does not show the date) prior to the 1st of December, 1904.\u00a0 There is nothing to show that the said Gutierrez represented the estate of the said Monta\u00f1a in this litigation.\u00a0 The personal representatives of the said Leon Monta\u00f1a were not made parties to this action.\u00a0 Therefore no judgment can be rendered which would affect their rights or interests in any way.\u00a0 Inasmuch, however, as the said Gutierrez represented himself and the other defendant, Feliciano Moreno, Feliciano Moreno being thus represented in litigation, and the contract being one creating a joint liability, a judgment may properly be rendered against each of them, Gutierrez and\u00a0 Moreno.\u00a0 In view of the fact that the contract was a joint obligation and not a several one, the lower court committed an error in dismissing the action as to the said Moreno.\u00a0 The lower court should have rendered a judgment against each of the said defendants Moreno and Gutierrez for an aliquot part of the original contract.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the fifth assignment of error, we are of the opinion, and so hold, that the plaintiff did not execute and deliver the alleged contract, by which he was to receive P30 per month until the said obligation was fully liquidated.\u00a0 We do find, however, that the plaintiff agreed to forego the payment of the interest upon said contract until the same was paid.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the sixth assignment of error, having found that\u00a0 the lower court committed no error in declaring that the plaintiff did not execute and deliver the contract of December 1, 1904, makes it unnecessary for us to discuss this assignment of error.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the seventh assignment of error, to wit, that the lower court committed an error in holding that the contract did not draw interest after the 1st day of January, 1905, instead of the 1st day of December, 1904, we are of the opinion that the court committed an error in this respect, for the reason that, by virtue of the indorsement signed by the plaintiff, made upon the original contract (Exhibit A), it was thereby agreed that the interest upon said contract should cease upon the said 1st day of<br\/>December, 1904.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the eight assignment of error, to wit, that the lower court committed an error in\u00a0 holding that the defendant paid to the plaintiff the sum of P747.03 to be applied upon the interest, it will be noted that upon the first page of Exhibit B there appears to be a credit of P717.41, while upon the second page of Exhibit B a credit seems to have been given on the 6th day of December, 1904, of P747.03.\u00a0 The defendant himself testified that the credit on the first page of Exhibit B, of P686.85, was included in the credit of P747.03.\u00a0 There is no question, it would seem, therefore, about the payment made by the defendant to the\u00a0 plaintiff of this sum of P747.03.\u00a0 The only question between the two parties with reference to this sum is whether it was a part payment of the principal or a payment on the interest due.\u00a0 The plaintiff claims that it was a payment of the interest due; the defendant denies this fact.\u00a0 There is no proof that the defendant, at the time he made the payment, indicated to what it should be applied.\u00a0 It is a rule well established that when a debtor makes payment to his creditor, in a case where the creditor holds two or more accounts against him, the creditor may apply the payment to whichever of the indebtednesses he pleases, in the absence of an express statement on the part of the debtor that the payment should be applied to one or another of the different claims.\u00a0 There being no proof, therefore, of request on the part of the defendant that the sum should be applied upon the payment of the principal, the plaintiff had a right to apply it to the payment of the interest then due.\u00a0 The lower court committed no error, therefore, in view of the proof, in applying this payment to the liquidation of the interest due.\u00a0 (See arts. 1172, 1173, 1174, Civil\u00a0 Code.)<br\/><br\/>With reference to the ninth assignment of error, the defendant himself testified (p. 22-a of the record) that the sum of P686.85, mentioned in Exhibit B, was included in the sum of P747.03.\u00a0 Therefore the finding of the court was in accordance with the proof adduced during the trial of the cause.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the tenth assignment of error, the record does not disclose that the book which was marked \"Exhibit No. 2\" was ever presented in evidence as proof.\u00a0 It is true that certain questions were asked with reference to the same.\u00a0 Granting that the parties intended to offer it as\u00a0 evidence, and that it was actually admitted as proof, while it contains some items which can\u00a0 scarcely be explained, yet the last page of it discloses the fact that the plaintiff's claim was proven beyond question, or at least by a preponderance of proof, to wit, that the defendant had paid\u00a0 only the sum of P747.03, and the sum of P38.35.\u00a0 We are of the opinion, and so hold, that the statement of the lower court with reference to this exhibit in no way affects or vitiates his conclusions.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the eleventh assignment of error, we are of the opinion, and so hold, that the lower court committed no error in indicating the kind of money in which the judgment was rendered by the sign for pesos.\u00a0 This court has held, in the case of Dougherty <i>vs.<\/i> Evangelista (7 Phil. Rep., 37), that in the absence of explanation or proof to the contrary the word \"peso\" in the judgment of the court must be understood to be \"peso\" in the established currency of this country at the time when the judgment was rendered.\u00a0 (See also Gaspar <i>vs.<\/i> Molina, 5 Phil. Rep., 197).<br\/><br\/>With reference to the twelfth assignment of error, the lower court found that there was due from the defendant to the plaintiff a certain number of \"pesos\" without indicating whether they were Mexican or Filipino pesos.\u00a0 The original contract expressly stated \"Mexican pesos.\"\u00a0 There was no evidence adduced during the trial which in any way indicated that there was any difference between the value of Mexican pesos and Filipino pesos, and unless the proof showed that there was a difference, under the decision of this court in the case of Dougherty <i>vs.<\/i> Evangelista, <i>supra<\/i>, we will assume that the word \"peso\" used in the judgment of the lower court means the peso constituting the currency of this country.\u00a0 The defendant in the court below not having attempted to show that there was a difference, and not having called the attention of the court below to the fact that there was a difference, we will consider that there was no difference and that the judgment of the lower court will not therefore be set aside for the reasons contended for by the appellant.<br\/><br\/>Our conclusions upon all of the facts of the record are as follows:<br\/><br\/>First.\u00a0 That the plaintiff loaned to the defendant, upon the 20th day of March, 1901, the sum of P3,000, at 10 per cent per annum.<br\/><br\/>Second.\u00a0 That upon the 1st day of December, 1904, the plaintiff agreed to relieve the defendant from the necessity of paying interest upon the said sum thereafter.\u00a0 (See Exhibit C.)<br\/><br\/>Third.\u00a0 That the defendant had paid to the plaintiff the sums of P747.03 and P38.35, to be applied on the payment of the interest of said note, or a total of P785.38.<br\/><br\/>Fourth.\u00a0 That under the terms of the contract the defendants were each liable to pay an aliquot part of the said original contract.<br\/><br\/>Fifth.\u00a0 That the estate of Leon Montana not being represented in this action, no judgment can be rendered against him or his personal representative.<br\/><br\/>The contract was executed and delivered on the 20th day\u00a0 of March, 1901, and drew interest at the rate of 10 per cent until the 1st day of December, 1904.\u00a0 The defendants had paid to the plaintiff the sum of P785.38.\u00a0 This amount was applied to the payment of the interest by the plaintiff.\u00a0 The interest due upon the 1st day of December, 1904, was P1,109.16.\u00a0 Deducting the amount paid (P785.38) from the amount of interest due (Pl,109,16) left a balance of interest unpaid on the 1st day of December, 1904, of P323.78.\u00a0 The total amount due on said contract, then, on the 1st day of December, 1904, was the amount of the original contract (P3,000) plus the interest unpaid (P323.78), making a total of P3,323.78.\u00a0 This action was commenced on the 27th day of February, 1905.\u00a0 The plaintiff is entitled, therefore, to draw interest from the date of the judicial demand (the 27th of February, 1905).<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the lower court is hereby modified, and it is hereby directed that a judgment be entered against the defendants, Eugenio Gutierrez and Feliciano Moreno, each respectively, for a one-third part of the sum of P3,323.78, with interest from the 27th day of February, 1905, with costs, Leon Monta\u00f1a nor his representatives not being made a party in this action, no judgment\u00a0 can be rendered against him.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Caballero on the 6th of June, 1907, on behalf of the heirs of the late Pablo Tuason and Leocadia Santiba\u00f1ez, counsel for the applicant, Case, on August 2, 1907, amended the original petition and set forth:\u00a0 that said property, situated in Calle Escolta, district of Binondo, consists of a parcel of land and the building erected thereon bearing Nos. 142 and 152; it is bounded on the northwest, approximately, by the <i>estero<\/i> of Santa Cruz and the property of Carmen de Ayala de Roxas; on the southeast by the River Pasig; on the southwest by the property of the heirs of Tuason and Santiba\u00f1ez; and on the northwest by Calle Escolta and the aforesaid property of Carmen de Ayala de Roxas; that the total area is 3,251.84 square meters, its description and boundaries being detailed in the plan attached to the petition; that according to the last assessment made for the purposes of taxation the land was valued at P170,231 and the buildings thereon at P30,000; that the property is free from all incumbrance, and no one has any interest therein or right thereto; that on the northeast side the property has in its favor the right of easement over some 234.20 square meters of land owned by the said Ayala de Roxas, and that the applicant acquired the property by succession from Do\u00f1a Clotilde Romree.<br\/><br\/>In the written opposition above alluded to, counsel for the heirs of Pablo Tuason and Leocadia Santiba\u00f1ez alleged that the parties whom he represents are owners in common of the property adjoining that of the petitioner on the southwest; that the latter, in making the plan attached to his petition, extended his southwest boundary line to a portion of the lot of the said heirs of Tuason and Santiba\u00f1ez in the form indicated by the red line in the annexed plan; that the true dividing line between the property of the petitioner and that of the said heirs is the walls indicated in black ink on the accompanying plan; that said walls belong to the opponents, and that about two years ago, when the applicant made alterations in the buildings erected on his land, he improperly caused a portion of them to rest on the wall owned by the parties whom he represents, at points 12, 13, and 14 of said plan; for which reason the opponent prayed the court to direct the applicant to amend the line marked in his plan with the letters Y, X, U, T, S, and R, so that it may agree with the wall indicated by the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,\u00a0 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 on the plan\u00a0 which accompanies the written opposition, reducing the area to whatever it may be after the amendment has been made; that\u00a0 the applicant be compelled to remove the supports that he placed for his buildings on the wall of the representatives of the petitioner, and that he be sentenced to pay the costs.<br\/><br\/>The case was brought to trial, both parties adduced evidence, and their exhibits were made of record.\u00a0 The court, assisted by the interested parties and their respective experts, made an inspection of the two properties, in view of which it entered judgment on the 31st of July, 1908, sustaining the opposition offered by the representative of the heirs of Pablo Tuason and Leocadia Santiba\u00f1ez, and after declaring a general default granted the registration of the property described in the application filed by Edwin Case, with the exclusion of the wall claimed by the opponents and shown on their plan by the lines numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\u00a0 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14; and in view of the fact that the lines drawn on the plan offered in evidence by the applicant under letter G are not correctly drawn, once this decision shall have become final, let the\u00a0 dividing line of both properties be fixed by common accord between the two parties and their experts, taking as a base for the same the\u00a0 amended line of walls drawn on the plan of the opponents, but should\u00a0 they not reach an agreement a surveyor of the Court of Land Registration shall be detailed to fix the same at the expense of the parties; the court also ordered the cancellation of the registration entries of the property entered in the name of Clotilde Romree, principal of the petitioner, at page 142 and those following of volume 15, section of Binondo and 52 of the register, property No. 828, first entry.<br\/><br\/>On the 12th of August, 1908, the petitioner moved for a new trial on the ground that the evidence was not sufficient to justify the decision of the court in excluding the wall claimed by the opponents; that said decision was contrary to the law, in so far as it excludes the said wall, and that the\u00a0 conclusions of fact therein are openly and manifestly contrary to the weight of the evidence in so far as they referred to the exclusion of said wall.\u00a0 The said motion was overruled on the 15th of the same month, to which overruling the applicant excepted and announced his intention to perfect the corresponding bill of exceptions which was filed, approved, and submitted to this court together with the proper assignment of errors.<br\/><br\/>In the appeal interposed by the applicant against the decision of the Court of Land Registration, now before this court, the questions set up are merely of fact.<br\/><br\/>The question is whether the wall that with slight interruption runs from Calle Escolta to the River Pasig, and which divides the adjoining properties of the applicant, Edwin Case, and of the opponents, belongs to the former, as he claimed in the first instance, or is a dividing wall as affirmed in his brief in this second instance, or is the property of the said opponents, the heirs of the late Tuason and Santiba\u00f1ez.<br\/><br\/>The trial court after considering the evidence adduced by both parties to the suit, found that the wall in controversy belongs to the opponents for the reason, among others, that in the public document by which one of their original ancestors acquired on the 19th of April, 1796, the property now possessed by them, it appears that the property was then already inclosed by a stone wall.\u00a0 This document, which was offered in evidence by the opponents, has not been impugned by the applicant.\u00a0 On the contrary, it was acknowledged as the title deed of the property adjoining that of the applicant by the witness Juan B. Tuason, who knows the one and the other.<br\/><br\/>It is fully proven that two walls extend from Calle Escolta to the interior of both properties, the one backing the other, and which respectively support the edifices of the petitioner and of the opponents from points 36, 35, 34, 33, 32, 31, and 30 on the plan of the petitioner corresponding to points 1 to 6 on that of the opponents.<br\/><br\/>This section of the wall of the opponents embraced within the points mentioned in the plans offered in evidence by the parties, for the very reason that it supports only the property of the opponents and not that of the petitioner, can not be a party wall, one-half of which along its entire length would belong to the adjoining building owned by Mr. Case.\u00a0 There is not sufficient proof to sustain such claim, and besides, the building erected thereon disproves the pretension of the petitioner.<br\/><br\/>It should, however, be noted that that portion of the wall between the numbers 3, 4, 5, and 6 on the plan of the opponents, which corresponds to numbers 33, 32, 31, and 30 of that of the petitioner, and which constitutes the cesspool on the property of the latter, belongs to him, and it has so been admitted by counsel for the opponents, for the reason that the petitioner had acquired it by prescription, the opponents having lost control over the area of land covered by the said cesspool together with the walls that inclose it.<br\/><br\/>Under article 572 of the Civil Code the easement of party walls is presumed, unless there is a title or exterior sign, or proof to the contrary, among others, in dividing walls of adjoining buildings up to the common point of elevation.<br\/><br\/>The legal presumption as to party walls is limited to the three cases dealt with\u00a0 in the said article of the code, and is that of <i>juris tantum<\/i> unless the contrary appear from the title of ownership of the adjoining properties, that is to say, that the entire wall in controversy belongs to one of the property owners, or where there is no exterior sign to destroy such presumption and support a presumption against the party wall.\u00a0 (Art. 573, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>The intermediate portion of the wall in question, lying between numbers 6 and 13 on the defendants plan, equivalent to a little more than numbers 30 to 25 on the plan of the petitioner, is the portion against which no other wall appears to have been erected on the land\u00a0 owned by Mr. Case.\u00a0 In spite of this it can not be presumed that the aforesaid portion was a party wall, and that it was not exclusively owned by the defendants, inasmuch as the latter have proven by means of a good title that has not been impugned by the petitioner, that when one of their ancestors and principals acquired the property the lot was already inclosed by the wall on which the building was erected; it must therefore be understood that in the purchase of the\u00a0 property the wall by which the land was inclosed was necessarily included.<br\/><br\/>The above documentary evidence has not been overcome by any other presented by the petitioner, but apart from that the record discloses the existence of certain unquestionable signs.\u00a0 These consist of constructions made by the petitioner himself on his own property which entirely destroy any presumption that it is a party wall, and indeed gives rise to a presumption against it.<br\/><br\/>Three openings have been made in the wall, undoubtedly to allow the passage of air and light.\u00a0 Two of them are beveled on the side toward the land of the objectors, and the third has recently been beveled on the other.\u00a0 A rafter or lintel was found imbedded in the wall on the side of the property of the opponents.\u00a0 These things constitute exterior signs and were recorded as the result of personal inspection by the trial court in company with the experts of both parties.\u00a0 These signs positively arid conclusively prove that the said wall is not a party wall, but the exclusive property of the defendant.\u00a0 This is further confirmed by the testimony of the witnesses at the trial.<br\/><br\/>The fact that the petitioner built a wall and backed it against the one in question to support the edifice he had constructed between points 21 and 13 of the corrected plan is a further indication that the neighboring wall is not a party one.\u00a0 He knew perfectly well that he had no right to rest his building on the latter.\u00a0 That he built a terrace about four years previously over the wall between points 30, 29, 28, and 27 does not prove that the whole of the wall, from the Escolta to the River Pasig, is a party wall, but it does show\u00a0 that he usurped a portion thereof to the prejudice of the real owner.<br\/><br\/>Neither can it be presumed that that part of the wall bordering on the River Pasig comprised between points 13 and 14 is a party wall.\u00a0 It was shown in the proceedings as resulting from the above-mentioned ocular inspection that at the side of the said wall, which is rather a low one, there is another, a higher one erected on the petitioner's land and backed against the one in question.\u00a0 The first one, as has been said, forms part of that which has surrounded the property from the date of its acquisition, more than a century ago, until the present date.\u00a0 It is absolutely independent of that built by the petitioner, and that it is the exclusive property of the objectors and is not a party wall can not be denied.<br\/><br\/>It therefore appears from the proceedings that, with the exception of the small portion of the wall in question occupied by the latrine on the property of the petitioner, and which the opponents admit that\u00a0 he has acquired by prescription, the\u00a0 whole of said wall from the Escolta to the River Pasig can not be presumed to be a party wall; the evidence to the contrary conclusively proves that it belonged exclusively to the defendants, and it has been further shown in the case that at one time an old building belonging to the opponents used to rest on a portion of the wall near the river.<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing, and considering that the judgment appealed from is in accordance with the law and the merits of the case, it is our opinion that the same should be affirmed in full, as we do hereby affirm it, with the costs against the petitioner.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C, J., Mapa, Johnson, Carson<\/i>, and<i> Moreland, JJ<\/i>., concur.<\/div>",

Rep., 011). The P2,000 had been received from the plaintiff by the defendant Rickards as a deposit while he was acting as agent for Smith, Bell &amp; Co. in.\u00a0 Dagupan, and the P4,200 was the amount of certain Spanish Government warrants delivered to him by the plaintiff and collected by him through the Hongkong Bank at Manila.\u00a0 It appeared that the P2,000 had been turned over to Smith, Bell &amp; Co. with notice of its ownership and on this ground their liability was placed, without respect to the terms of the agency of Rickards.\u00a0 It was fairly to be inferred from his testimony on the first trial that the firm had also had the benefit of the collection of the government warrants.\u00a0 The court in its decision said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The question in this case is this: Can the positive testimony of Rickards, which has been set forth above, be overcome by the testimony of the agent of the bank in view of the fact that Smith, Bell &amp; Co. had it in their power to demonstrate the falsity of the testimony of Rickards by producing their books?\u00a0 No reason appears in the case why the books were not produced.\u00a0 The trial was had in Manila, where is located the main office of Smith, Bell &amp; Co. Rickards gave his testimony at the opening of the trial.\u00a0 If it were false its falsity could have been easily proved by the introduction of these books, and their production was more imperatively demanded considering the statement of Rickards that he had seen them, and that they did contain the entries in regard to this amount of 4,200 pesos.<br\/><br\/><center>*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><\/center> <br\/>\"In the present case we think that the ends of justice require that there should be a new trial as to the 4,200 pesos.<br\/><br\/><center>*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><\/center> <br\/>\"The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded to the court below for a new trial only of the issue relating to the 4,200 pesos.\u00a0 After the new trial judgment will, as a matter of course, be entered for the plaintiff against Smith, Bell &amp; Co. in reference to the 2,000 pesos, and for or against them in respect to the 4,200 pesos, as the results of the new trial may require.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\"<br\/><\/blockquote>On the second trial it appeared that the only book kept at Dagupan relating to these transactions was a small account book in the handwriting of Rickard's clerk, transcribed by him from pencil memoranda made by Rickards himself, which does not bear the name of Smith, Bell &amp; Co., which appears to be a memorandum book and includes other transactions of his with which that firm had nothing to do, and which is evidently his personal account and not that of his principals.\u00a0 The books of the firm showing his transactions in Dagupan were kept by D. M. Clark, the manager of the mills at Bayambang, to whom Rickard's reported and with whom he monthly exchanged accounts.<br\/><br\/>In none of these accounts did these government warrants appear nor any entry of the monies received therefrom.<br\/><br\/>Upon the first trial it was proved by H. D. C. Jones, of the Hongkong Bank, that from the proceeds of these notes a personal debt of Rickards to that bank, amounting to Pl,854, growing out of an old transaction, of his as agent for Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., had been satisfied.\u00a0 It also was shown that he had turned over to one Rafael Sison P1,192 and he also swore that he had paid the firm either P6000 or P900 on a private debt.\u00a0 His cash book produced at the second trial confirms Mr. Jones' testimony and also shows the payment of Sison, as well as some other items, so that it is established that, with the exception of a few hundred pesos, no part of the proceeds of the P4,200 can have been received by Smith, Bell &amp; Co. as the immediate proceeds of these warrants.<br\/><br\/>Clive Kingcome, one of the managers of the firm, who at the time of the first trial was not a witness on account of absence from the country, testified on the second trial in detail as to the books of the firm, the manner of conducting its business in Dagupan and Bayambang, and the transactions with Rickards.\u00a0 He said that, had the dealings been such as Rickards narrated, the entries thereof would have appeared in the Bayambang books and that, moreover, he had no recollection whatever of receiving either P600 or P900 in settlement of any account of Rickards, and that no trace thereof or of any such payment could be found in the books.<br\/><br\/>The agency of Rickards was supposedly if or the purpose of buying rice and sacks.\u00a0 It existed for the period of one year only and he admitted that, prior thereto and since the year 1882, he had been conducting a similar business at Dagupan, but not for Smith, Bell &amp; Co.\u00a0 He showed by his book and by his declaration that during this year he received from persons at Dagupan large sums in cash for remittance to Manila, which he effected by notifying Smith, Bell &amp; Co. of the amounts and using the actual cash received in the local purchase of rice and bags on their account, thus effecting a saving to both parties of a considerable railway charge for carrying the money to and fro, and that these operations were known to his principals and approved by them.\u00a0 However this course of business might affect the 2,000-peso claim or any other deposit of money received by him, it has no bearing upon the transaction in these certificates which were not cash deposited with him button the contrary, were handed to him by the plaintiff in order to be converted into cash, which he was to collect and repay her.\u00a0 It appears that he wrote to the firm at Manila asking their advice in respect to the warrants and was by them referred to the Hongkong Bank, which undertook to effect their collection, a thing at that precise period, at the outbreak of the revolution, of some difficulty on account of reluctance of the Spanish Government to send into the provinces money which might serve to supply funds to the revolutionary forces.\u00a0 It is not shown that Smith, Bell &amp; Co. had ever adopted any similar course of business in regard to the collection of similar warrants or of any drafts, or that they had intervened in this instance otherwise than as a matter of favor to their correspondent, or that they had received the proceeds of the collection, or had made any entries thereof in their own books, or in any manner recognized it.<br\/><br\/>The receipt given for the warrants read:<br\/><blockquote>\"I have received from Da. Monica Cason three Treasury warrants of the value of 4,200 pesos, with the interest thereon, to collect in Manila; said amount of $4,200, when collected from the treasury, I promise to deliver to said Da. Monica Cason, in cash, to her order.\u00a0 Calasiao, October 8, 1896.\u00a0 F. W. Rickards.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The firm did not sign this receipt and is not referred to therein.<br\/><br\/>Articles 286 and 287 of the Code of Commerce, cited by the defendant to establish the liability of the firm, apply to contracts made by factors, but in this case the relation of factor has not been established.\u00a0 This rather appears to be an instance of an agent, if he was one, dealing in his own name and on his own responsibility and not that of his principal.\u00a0 (Code of Commerce, arts. 245, 24:6, and 247; Castle Bros., Wolf &amp; Sons <i>vs<\/i>. Go-Juno, 7 Phil. Rep., 144.)\u00a0 The mere custom of a local agent receiving monies on deposit for which his principal, the firm, might, perhaps, on general principles of the law of agency, have made itself liable whether the money had been actually received by it or not, does not suffice to charge them with liability for the essentially different operation of the isolated collection of a draft for his clients, such collection not creating any appearance of a general banking business upon which third persons had a right to rely.\u00a0 Neither in fact nor in appearance was any agency for this purpose authorized or permitted by Smith, Bell &amp; Co., and the transaction as to these warrants was one for which Rickards alone is responsible to the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>On the second trial the court directed judgment against Smith, Bell &amp; Co. for the equivalent of 4,200 Mexican dollars at the rate stipulated by the parties, less 5 per cent collected by the firm as commissions, amounting to P4,269 together with interest thereon from March 30, 1897, amounting to P2,689, making a total of P6,958.\u00a0 The allowance of interest from the date of the first demand by the plaintiff was correct, but the computation should have been upon the 4,200 Mexican dollars, without the deduction of the percentage, resulting in P4,494, for which judgment in favor of the plaintiff should be entered against the defendant Rickards, with interest from March 30, 1897.\u00a0 The trial court committed no error in following the statute and computing the value of the 2,000 Mexican pesos as of the date of the entry of the second judgment, rather than as of the date of the first judgment, and such is the correct interpretation of the former decision in this case.\u00a0 Judgment is accordingly directed affirming the judgment of the Court of First Instance on the second trial in respect to the P2,000 and interest against Smith, Bell &amp; Co., and reversing it as to the judgment of P4,200 in respect of which, with interest thereon from March 30, 1897, judgment is directed to be entered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant, F. W. Rickards, but without costs to any of the parties in this instance.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa, Johnson<\/i>, and <i>Willard, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><br\/><hr align=\"center\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><br\/>DISSENTING<\/span><br\/><\/div><i><br\/><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">CARSON, J., <\/span><br style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\/><br\/>I dissent.<br\/>I think there is sufficient evidence in the record to charge Smith, Bell &amp; Co. with responsibility for the total amount claimed, under the provisions of articles 286 and 287 of the Code of Commerce, which are as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Art. 286.\u00a0 Contracts made by the factor of a manufacturing or commercial establishment or enterprise, when it is common knowledge that he belongs to a well-known enterprise or association, shall be understood as made for the account of the owner of said enterprise or association, even though the factor did not mention this fact at the time of making the contract; or that breach of trust, transgression of powers, or appropriation of the goods, which are the subject of the contract is alleged, provided these contracts involve objects included in the transactions or business of the establishment, or if, not being of this kind, it should be proven that the factor acted according to orders from his principal, or that the latter approved his action in express terms or by positive acts.<br\/><br\/>\"Art. 287.\u00a0 A contract made by a factor in his own name shall bind him directly with the person with whom it was made; but if the transaction was made for the account of the principal, the other contracting party may bring his action against the factor or against the principal.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><\/div>",

that the defendant, instead of going to some person or officer who had authority to perform the marriage ceremony, carried the said Leoncia Geronimo about the city of Manila for three or four hours, and then made the excuse that it was Saturday afternoon and it\u00a0 would be impossible to find any person or officer who would be able to perform said marriage ceremony.\u00a0 He continued to drive about the city of Manila until about 9 o'clock at night, when he took the said Leoncia to the rooms of a <i>cochero<\/i>, where he remained with her, and where he had illicit relations with her, and remained in said room until about 11 or 12 o'clock at night.\u00a0 Later, in the same night, the defendant took the said, Leoncia to other places or homes of relatives and friends, and finally to the house of one of his acquaintances and there remained with the said Leoncia and slept in the same bed until the next morning.<br\/><br\/>Third.\u00a0 That the next morning (the 6th of September) the defendant took the said Leoncia to the house of one of his relatives and left her there and, without giving her any explanation, went away.\u00a0 She remained in this house for a period of ten or fifteen days before she returned to the home of her parents.\u00a0 During these fifteen days the defendant did not return to see Leoncia.<br\/><br\/>Fourth.\u00a0 So far as the record shows, Leoncia Geronimo had always borne a good reputation as an honest, virtuous, respectable girl, and her submission to the defendant in the room of the said <i>cochero<\/i>, as above indicated, was clearly by reason of the promise of the defendant to marry her then and there.\u00a0 We are satisfied, from the evidence, that the defendant accomplished his illegal purpose through fraud and deceit and that he had no intention, when he induced Leoncia to leave her home and parents, of marrying her.<br\/><br\/>The defendant denies that he had any illicit relations with the said Leoncia, and that therefore he is not guilty of the crime charged.\u00a0 The supreme court of Spain, in discussing this question in a decision rendered the 19th of June, 1891, said:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"Whereas, with regard to the first and second assignment of errors that it appears both in the charge filed by the prosecuting attorney and in the first paragraph\u00a0 of the judgment appealed from, that Do\u00f1a Isolina Procura was under 23 but more than 12 years of age, and that the facts held to be proven in the case constitute the crime of abduction, defined\u00a0 and punished by article 465 of the Penal Code of Cuba and Porto Rico (461 of that of the Peninsula), the fact that the accused stated that the carnal intercourse, attributed to him by the injured party, had not taken place is not a bar thereto, inasmuch as it is not the deed that the said article punishes, but the intent which prompted the perpetration of this crime which in the present case exists beyond all doubt by reason of the amorous relations between the accused and Do\u00f1a Isolina, and the punishment of the offense to public morals and to the family by removing from the direction and vigilance of the latter a maiden under age.\" <\/blockquote><br\/>The evidence clearly shows that the defendant induced the said Leoncia to leave the house of her parents under the promise of marriage, without any intention of fulfilling said promise, and that he had, under said promise, induced her to have illicit relations with him, and that therefore he should be punished in accordance with the provisions of article 446 of the Penal Code,\u00a0 The lower court imposed the penalty of <i>presidio correccional<\/i>.\u00a0 The penalty provided for by said article 446 is <i>prision correccional<\/i>.\u00a0 The sentence of the lower court, therefore, should be changed from <i>presidio correccional<\/i> to <i>prision correccional<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>The lower court failed also to make any provision for the recognition and maintenance of a child, should one be born from said illicit relations which took place between the defendant and the said Leoncia.\u00a0 The sentence of the lower court should have made provisions for the recognition and maintenance of such child.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, for the foregoing reasons, the sentence of the lower court is modified and the defendant is hereby sentenced to be imprisoned for a period of one year, eight months, and twenty-one days of <i>prision correccional<\/i>, with the accessory penalties, to pay to the offended party the sum of P500, and to recognize and maintain the offspring should there be any, and to pay the costs.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Carson<\/i>, and <i>Moreland, JJ<\/i>, concur.<br\/><br\/><i>Sentenced modified<\/i>.<br\/><br\/><blockquote>[Extract from the minutes of the proceedings of the Supreme Court.]<\/blockquote><br\/><div style=\"text-align: right;\">\"OCTOBER 7, 1909.<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"After having considered the petition filed by attorney Mercado, counsel for the defendant Benito Meneses in case No. 5185 for the crime of abduction, finally sentenced by this court on the 27th of September last, stating that for the corresponding legal purposes he\u00a0 offered the annexed certificate of marriage celebrated between the aggrieved person, Leoncia Geronimo, and the said Benito Meneses, the court held that:\u00a0 Inasmuch as the defendant has furnished satisfactory proof of his marriage with the aggrieved party, and, considering section 2 of Act No. 1773 of the Philippine Commission, his liability is now extinguished together with the penalty imposed; should he be in custody, he shall forthwith be released, and if now out on bail, his bond shall be cancelled.\u00a0 The record to be remanded to the trial court with a copy of this finding for proper action.'\"<br\/><\/div>",

Sixto Molo (5 Phil. Rep., 412), where it is said that (p. 414):\u00a0 \"Under the provisions of this section (section 25), after the defendant has interposed one plea, either guilty or not guilty, his right to change his plea is within the discretion of the trial court.\"\u00a0 Therefore, the error assigned as to this point is unfounded.<br\/><br\/>The accused maintains that the newspaper article that gave rise to the complaint is not, in any sense, a libelous article.\u00a0 It is sufficient to read the facts as stated in the complaint, to which the defendant has pleaded guilty, in order to be fully convinced of the contrary.\u00a0 By such a declaration the latter\u00a0 has admitted that it is true, as alleged in the complaint, that the words and terms used in the writing above alluded to mean and signify, among other things, that the injured party, who is a lawyer by profession, is <i>a useless and ignorant lawyer<\/i> * * *; <i>that his head is hollow-like a drum<\/i> * * * <i>that he does not see or understand, or serve for anything, that his law-office is deserted, being visited only by flies, and that he is a doctor in brutalities, licensed in savagery, and teaches brutality and inhumanity;<\/i> all of which is, and can not certainly be otherwise than contrary to law, and highly prejudicial to the good name, credit, and reputation of a lawyer.<br\/><br\/>The defense finally alleges that the penalty imposed by the judgment is excessive, inasmuch as the complaint contains no allegation of any qualifying circumstance to demonstrate the criminal perversity of the accused, his evil intentions, or a habit of defaming others.\u00a0 There is no better answer to this than the allegations of the complaint:<br\/><blockquote>\"The\u00a0 said Bernardo Sanchez-so it reads-knowingly, willfully, unlawfully, and criminally, and <i>with intent to defame<\/i>, caused to be edited and did edit a newspaper under the name of '<i>Ang Pudlos' with\u00a0 the exclusive object of attacking the honor and reputation of persons<\/i> * * *.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The crime of libel is punished by Act\u00a0 No. 277 with a fine not exceeding two thousand dollars, or with imprisonment not exceeding one year, or both.\u00a0 As may be seen, there is no mention of the imposition of hard labor; for this reason the imprisonment imposed by .the judgment appealed from should be understood to be without hard labor.<br\/><br\/>With this sole modification the judgment is hereby affirmed with the costs of this instance against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

CHUA JAMCO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>CARSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">On November 10, 1906, plaintiff and defendant executed a written agreement whereby the business partnership then existing between them was dissolved, and plaintiff sold and defendant bought plaintiff's interest in the partnership for the sum of P1,728.94, payable in three installments, as set out in the agreement.  The amended complaint alleged that the total indebtedness thus contracted by the defendant had become due and payable and had not been paid in whole or in part at the time when that complaint was filed.  Judgment was rendered in the court below in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant for P1,728.94 together with interest upon the various installments from the date when they fell due.  From this judgment defendant appealed, and the case is now before us on his bill of exceptions.<br\/><br\/>Some question arose in the court below as to whether all of the deferred payments had become due and payable when the original complaint was filed in this action, but appellant having made no assignment of error on this ground we are not called upon to review the action of the court in this regard.<br\/><br\/>Appellant admits the execution of the contract, but denies plaintiff's right to a recovery thereunder, on the ground that plaintiff failed to comply with his obligation to deliver the property sold to the purchaser and to secure to him the peaceable possession thereof (<i>entregar y sanear<\/i>), as prescribed in article 1461 of the Civil Code.  But it affirmatively appears, both from the admissions of the defendant on the witness stand, and from the fact that the sale was made by means of a notarial instrument (art. 1462, Civil Code), that the property sold was in fact delivered to the defendant.  And while it appears that plaintiff, after the sale had been consummated, improperly instituted an action for the dissolution of the partnership and the distribution of the partnership assets, and procured the appointment of a receiver for the partnership property, it also affirmatively appears that defendant vigorously opposed the appointment of the receiver, and secured his discharge and the dismissal of the complaint praying for the dissolution of the partnership, by asserting his right to the whole property under the very contract the enforcement of which he now resists.  Article 1124 of the Civil Code, which recognizes and defines the right of either party to a conditional contract (<i>obligation condicional<\/i>) to rescind (<i>resolver<\/i>) the contract upon the failure of the other to perform the obligations assumed thereunder, gives to the injured party the right to elect whether he will enforce or rescind (<i>resolver<\/i>) but it need hardly be said that he can not do both.  Appellant, after the receiver was appointed, insisted upon the enforcement of his contract, secured the discharge of the receiver, and the return of the property to his possession and control.  Clearly he is not entitled now to claim that the commission of the property to the hands of a receiver entitles him to rescind the very contract which he elected to enforce for the purpose of taking the property out of the hands of the receiver; and the trial court properly held that he is bound by its terms.<br\/><br\/>The defendant set up several counterclaims alleging various causes of action against the plaintiff, only two of which need to be considered upon this appeal, no assignment of error having been made as to the disposition of the others by the trial court.<br\/><br\/>The basis of the first counterclaim to be considered is the alleged damage occasioned by the deterioration of defendant's goods as a result of their detention, after the dissolution of the partnership, in the hands of the receiver appointed in the action above mentioned.  The trial court properly, as we hold, excluded the evidence submitted by the defendant in support of this cause of action on the ground that the damages claimed were <i>res adjudicata<\/i>.  It appears that in the course of the action out of which the appointment of the receiver arose, defendant in this action, who was also defendant in that action, prayed for the discharge of the receiver and damages occasioned by the action of the plaintiff in procuring his appointment.  Judgment was rendered in favor of the defendant in that action and the receiver discharged, but nothing was said therein as to defendant's claim for damages, and the claim of the defendant for damages must, therefore, be taken to have been disallowed.<br\/><br\/>Section 97 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that \u2014<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"If the right out of which the counterclaim arises exists at the time of the commencement of the action and arises out of the transaction set forth in the complaint as the foundation of the plaintiff's claim, or is necessarily connected with the subject of the action, neither the defendant nor his assignee can afterwards maintain an action against the plaintiff therefor, if the defendant omits to set up a counterclaim for the same.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>Section 177 provides that the damages resulting from the unlawful procurement of the appointment of a receiver \"shall be ascertained by the court and, in its final judgment in the action, shall be decreed against the plaintiff and the sureties on the obligation.\"<br\/><br\/>Section 307 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that \u2014<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"That only is deemed to have been adjudged in a former judgment which appears upon its face to have been so adjudged or which was actually and necessarily included therein or necessary thereto.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>Manifestly, under these provisions, the question of damages resulting from the improper procurement of the appointment of a receiver by the plaintiff in the former action was properly held by the trial court in this action to be <i>res adjudicata<\/i>, and, therefore, not a proper subject of inquiry in this action.<br\/><br\/>Counsel urges that in so far as the decision in the former case was silent on the question of damages it was manifestly erroneous, because the court having declared that the receiver had been improvidently and unnecessarily appointed, and that the defendant had been unlawfully deprived of his property at the instance of the plaintiff, defendant was clearly entitled to damages.  But an examination of the record discloses that defendant accepted the judgment in that case, made no objection thereto on the ground he now urges as a reason why he should not be bound thereby, and took no appeal therefrom.  In explanation he says that he was so anxious to secure the dismissal of the receiver and the return of the property to his possession, because it was rapidly  deteriorating and losing its value as time went by, that he could not afford to appeal, and thus continue the possession of the property in the hands of the receiver pending the course of the appeal on the question of damages.  But the reasons which it is alleged induced defendant to accept without appeal the decision of the court in the former case in no wise affect the legal consequences flowing from his conduct in that regard; and we may add that the record discloses that defendant did not even move the trial judge to modify or to amplify his decision so as to settle expressly the question of damages, a motion which would not necessarily have involved any considerable delay, and that even had defendant been compelled to appeal, the bond given when the receiver was appointed must be taken to have been sufficient to protect the defendant for all losses and damages arising from the improper detention of the goods in the hands of the receiver.<br\/><br\/>The second cause of action set up by the defendant by way of counterclaim is his alleged unlawful detention at the instance of the plaintiff on the 21st day of November, 1906, eleven days after the contract of sale had been entered into.  It is  alleged that upon that occasion plaintiff, seeing the defendant at the dock at Legaspi en route with various boxes of merchandise to Manila, called a policeman, charged the defendant with robbery, and procured his arrest without a warrant and his detention at the police station for a few hours, after which defendant was released without further proceedings; and that as a result of this unlawful detention defendant missed his boat and suffered heavy damages because of his failure to reach the Christmas and New Year's market in Manila, for which he was bound with his goods, and because of the deterioration of these goods as a result of his failure to find an immediate sale therefor.  The trial court appears to have been of opinion that the alleged unlawful acts of the plaintiff from which the alleged damages to the defendant arose would constitute, if proven, the crime of <i>acusacion \u00f3 denuncia falsa<\/i>, as defined and penalized in article 326 of the Penal Code, and excluded all evidence as to this cause of action relying upon the decision of this court in the case of Quiros <i>vs.<\/i> Tan-Guinlay (5 Phil. Rep., 675), wherein we held that  \u2014<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"Neither a civil nor a criminal action for damages arising from the commission of the crime of <i>acusacion \u00f3 denuncia falsa<\/i> can be instituted unless the court which investigated the crime falsely charged or accused directed the institution of criminal proceedings against the false accuser.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>The allegations of defendant's counterclaim not disclosing that any court had directed the institution of criminal proceedings based on the alleged unlawful acts of the plaintiff, and affirmatively disclosing that no investigation of the crime falsely charged had ever been made, the trial court was of opinion that a civil action for damages could not be instituted in the absence of such directions.<br\/><br\/>But in the decision of this court in the case of the United States <i>vs.<\/i> Quiroga (7 Phil. Rep., 388), we held that \u2014<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"One who makes a complaint to a policeman, charging a third person with the commission of an offense can not be tried and convicted under article 326 of the Penal Code for the crime of <i>acusacion \u00f3 denuncia falsa<\/i>.  A policeman is not an administrative or judicial officer in the sense in which those words are used in the said article 326.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>It is evident, therefore, that the provisions of that article are in no wise applicable to the case under review, and we are of opinion that the defendant was entitled to a hearing upon his counterclaim,  to an  opportunity to prove the damages alleged therein, and to have  such damages, if proven, recognized and provided for in the judgment in this action.<br\/><br\/>In the discussion of the case by the members of this court after submission on appeal, it was suggested that the provisions of articles 1195 and 1196 of the Civil Code deny to the defendant the right to set up a counterclaim for unliquidated damages against plaintiff's claim based on the contractual obligation set out in the complaint.<br\/><br\/>These articles are as follows:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"ART. 1195.  Compensation shall take place when two persons, in their own right, are mutually creditors and debtors of each other.<br\/><br\/>\"ART. 1196.  In order that compensation may be proper, it is required:<br\/><br\/>\"1.  That each of the persons bound should be so principally, and that he be at the same time the principal creditor of the other.<br\/><br\/>\"2.  That both debts consist of a sum of money or, when the things due are perishable, that they be of the same kind and also of the same quality, if the latter should have been stipulated.<br\/><br\/>\"3.  That both debts be due.<br\/><br\/>\"4.  That they be determined and demandable.<br\/><br\/>\"5.  That none of them is subject to any retention or suit instituted by a third person, and of which due notice has been given the debtor.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>It will be seen, however, that the compensation here provided for while it resembles in many respects the common law set-off, and certain counterclaims provided for in the Code of Civil  Procedure, differs therefrom in that a set-off  or a counterclaim must be pleaded to be effectual; whereas compensation takes place by mere operation of Jaw, and extinguishes reciprocally the two debts as soon as they exist simultaneously, to the amount of their respective sums.  (11 La. Ann., 520; 16 La. Ann., 181.)<br\/><br\/>We think that the provisions of chapter 5 of the new Code of Civil Procedure, and especially section 95 thereof, which is as follows:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"SEC. 95.  The defendant may set forth by answer as many defenses and counterclaims as he may have, whatever their nature.  They must be separately stated, and the several defenses must refer to the cause of action which they are intended to answer in a manner by which they may be intelligibly distinguished.  The defendant may also answer one or more of the several causes of action stated in the complaint, and demur to the residue \u2014\" <\/blockquote><br\/>give to the defendant, in any action instituted against him, the right, if he so desires, to secure in that action the final disposition of all claims which he may have against the plaintiff, whatever may be their nature or origin and the judgment appealed from should, therefore, be reversed, and the record returned to the trial court, where the parties will be given an opportunity to submit evidence upon the last above-mentioned cause of action set up in defendant's counterclaim, and the judgment already rendered will be modified or not in accordance with defendant's success or failure in establishing the damages alleged in this counterclaim.<br\/><br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

PASTOR ALCAZAR, ADMINISTRATOR OF THE ESTATE OF MATEA ALVAREZ Y RUBIO; DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>WILLARD, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">The plaintiff\u00a0 and appellee presented a claim before the commissioners appointed in the matter of the estate of Do\u00f1a Matea Alvarez y Rubio based upon a written document executed by the deceased on the 10th day of January, 1896, which is as follows:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"I hereby acknowledge to be indebted to Don Guillermo Bowler in the sum of 13,915 pesos, received by me from him as a loan without interest, and I bind myself, with all my present and future property, to return the said amount within the period of two years from this date, that is, on January 10, 1898.\u00a0 And, in order that he may prove his rights in due time, I deliver to him this instrument, the execution of which has been witnessed by Don Marcos Arcenas, Don Antonio Laserna, and Don Rafael Rodriguez, all residents of this town.\u00a0 Capiz, January 10, 1896.-(Signed) Matea Alvarez.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>The commissioners held that the plaintiff was entitled to the amount due on the obligation, together with interest thereon at the rate of 10\u00a0 per cent, and allowed ths claim for the sum of P23,971.08.\u00a0 The administrator appealed to the Court of First Instance.\u00a0 In that court he admitted that the estate was liable for the\u00a0 balance due on the note, without interest, that is to say for P10,794.49, but claimed that it was not liable for interest thereon.\u00a0 The court over-ruled this claim, held that the defendant was liable for the interest at the rate of 10 per cent and ordered judgment for P27,072.25, with interest thereon from the 10th day of September, 1908, the date of the judgment, at 10 per cent per annum.<br\/><br\/>The only question in the case is whether the estate is liable or not for interest.\u00a0 The appellee devotes a large part of his brief to a discussion of the question as to whether parol evidence was admissible to show an agreement made in 1896 iq the effect that the debtor should pay interest at the rate of 10 per cent per annum until the obligation was discharged, and he claims that such evidence was admissible.\u00a0 This discussion is entirely beside the case, as will be seen by an examination of the evidence.\u00a0 That evidence shows that no parol agreement of that kind was made.\u00a0 The only evidence in the case relating to what took place at the time the document was executed was the evidence of the debtor's bookkeeper, who testified that, although the note was for the sum of 13,915 pesos, yet Do\u00f1a Matea, as a matter of fact, received only 11,500 pesos, and that the difference ,between the amount of cash received and the amount stated in the note was the interest computed in advance for two years and included in the note.\u00a0 This witness did not testify that there was any verbal agreement on the part of Do\u00f1a Matea to pay interest nor any verbal agreement of any kind between her and the creditor.\u00a0 The appellee himself was a witness and he testified to no such conversation or agreement.\u00a0 The court below apparently held that the mere fact that interest was computed in advance for the two years during which the note was to run and was included in the note was evidence of an agreement on the part of the debtor to pay interest after the maturity of the note.\u00a0 We do not think that this theory can be sustained.\u00a0 All that such evidence shows is that the creditor was to receive interest for the two years from 1896 to 1898, but it does not tend to prove any agreement as to what should be done with reference to the matter of interest after the note became due provided it was not paid, and there is nothing in the case to show that the parties did not contemplate the immediate payment of the note at its maturity.\u00a0 In fact, as the appellee himself says in his brief:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"In the second place, all the rules of evidence oblige us to presume that each one of the contracting parties expected that the debtor, or Do\u00f1a Matea Alvarez, should exactly fulfill her obligation at its maturity.\u00a0 * * *\u00a0 The promissory note does not state anything as to interest after its maturity, for the very reason that the nonpayment of the same at the proper time was not anticipated by either party.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>If the\u00a0 prepayment of the interest for two years had the effect of eliminating the words \"without interest\" found in the note, it would leave the obligation without any clause expressly providing for the payment of interest, and under such circumstances interest can not be collected.\u00a0 (Art. 1755 Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>It is well settled that where no agreement as to interest is made interest does not commence to run on loans not mercantile until some demand for payment is made.<br\/><br\/>The evidence, therefore, shows no obligation on the part of Do\u00f1a Matea to pay interest after the maturity of the note, to wit, the 10th day of January, 1898.\u00a0 She died on the 26th day of May, 1897.\u00a0 After her death and on the 5th day of March, 1899, Marcos Arcenas signed the following document:.<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"The undersigned, in his own name and as attorney in fact of the heirs of Do\u00f1a Maria Geronima Rubio, acknowledging the obligation of payment contracted by Do\u00f1a Matea Alvarez y Rubio on January 10, 1896, in favor of Don Guillermo Bowler, as a true and lawful obligation, and to which this document refers, shall pay to the said Don Guillermo Bowler, on the 10th day of January, 1900, the sum of 13,915 pesos, and, as interest thereon, ten per cent upon that amount from January 10, 1898, until the date of its payment,\u00a0 with the understanding that, in case of insolvency, Don Guillermo Bowler will be entitled to exercise his rights against the intestate estate of said Do\u00f1a Matea Alvarez for the sum aforesaid.\u00a0\u00a0 The payment of the above principal and interest I will make at the city of Iloilo to the order of Don Guillermo Bowler or of the person authorized to this effect by the same Don Guillermo Bowler.- Capiz, March 5, 1809.-(Signed) Marcos Arcenas.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>It is not necessary to consider in this case the legal effect of this document.\u00a0 It is not necessary to consider whether it made the heirs of the deceased personally liable for the payment of this debt.\u00a0 The acceptance of the estate by the heirs without the benefit of an inventory might make them liable personally for the debts of the deceased existing at the time of her death as was held in the case of Ortiz <i>vs<\/i>. Aramburo (8 Phil. Rep., 98).\u00a0\u00a0 Whether they would be liable for obligations incurred after the death of the deceased we have no occasion to consider here.\u00a0 The question to be considered is, what class of demands should be presented to the commissioners appointed to hear claims against the estate, and had the commissioners any authority to allow a claim for interest which claim did not exist at the time of the death of the deceased, but arose from dealings between the heirs and the creditor which took place after such death.\u00a0 This question has already been considered and decided in the case of the Philippine Trading Company <i>vs<\/i>. Crossfield (5 Phil. Rep., 400).\u00a0 It was there held, speaking of the powers of the commissioners and of section 686 of the Code of Civil Procedure (p. 401):<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"This section means that their jurisdiction is limited to claims which existed prior to the death of the deceased and which survived him, and that they have no jurisdiction over any claim which did not arise during his lifetime.\u00a0 Causes of action which arise after a person's death are not proper claims for presentation to such committee.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>This claim for interest not existing prior to the death of the deceased, and the cause of action therefor having arisen after the\u00a0 death of Do\u00f1a Matea, the commissioners erred in allowing it.<br\/><br\/>The appellee makes the point in his brief that we can not consider the evidence because it is not expressly made a part of the bill of exceptions.\u00a0 The testimony of the witnesses was attached to the bill of exceptions, was duly certified by the official stenographer, and was sent here with the bill of exceptions, but it is true that there is no statement in the bill of exceptions that it is made a part thereof.\u00a0 This however was a mere formal defect which, under the provisions of section 500 of the Code of Civil Procedure, could be corrected by an amendment to the bill of exceptions, and the bill of exceptions in this case will be considered as amended by inserting a clause therein to the effect that the evidence is made a part of the bill of exceptions.<br\/><br\/>The appellee also says that not all of the evidence has been brought here and specifies certain books of account which were presented as proof and which have not been sent to this court.\u00a0 But an examination of the record shows that the evidence contained in those books is entirely immaterial because the facts which they tended to prove were proved by other evidence in the case and relates to matters about which there was no dispute, namely that Do\u00f1a Matea Alvarez received only 11,500 pesos when the note was made, and that certain payments were made after her death by the heirs.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below is reversed and the case is remanded\u00a0 with instructions to enter judgment allowing the claim of the plaintiff in the sum of 10,794.49 pesos, Mexican currency, reduced to Philippine currency at the rate named in the decision of the court below, with\u00a0 interest thereon at the rate of 6 per cent per annum from the date of the presentation of the claim by the plaintiff to the commissioners.\u00a0 No costs will be allowed to either party in this court.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Nera, offered to\u00a0 buy of the defendant some <i>sinamay<\/i>, indicating a price which he was willing to pay-which was much less than the price fixed by the defendant.\u00a0 Soon thereafter a certain woman offered to buy some <i>sinamay<\/i> of the defendant and the price was agreed upon between the said woman and the defendant.\u00a0 Thereafter the defendant, with a pocket knife, cut off of a large piece 3 yards of <i>sinamay<\/i> for the said woman.\u00a0 After the 3 yards had been cut off the woman refused to accept or to pay for the same, whereupon an altercation and quarrel arose between the defendant and the woman.\u00a0 Nera, the policeman, who had lingered near the place where the defendant was selling his wares, appeared upon the scene, drew near and interfered or took part in the discussion between the defendant and the woman.\u00a0 The defendant requested the policeman not to interfere in his private matters.\u00a0 The policeman says that the defendant drew his knife in a threatening manner, whereupon he, the policeman, by means of his club (according to the policeman) knocked the knife out of the hand of the defendant.\u00a0 The defendant asserts that the policeman took the knife out of his pocket, where he had put it after having cut off the <i>sinamay<\/i> as above indicated.<br\/><br\/>From the evidence there seems to have been no reason for the interference of the policeman.\u00a0 There is nothing in the record which justifies us in finding that the defendant did in any way resist the policeman or in any way show him disrespect, or in any way interfere with him in the performance of his duty.\u00a0 It seems to us that the conduct of the policeman was nothing more than that of meddlesome interference in a matter with which he had nothing to do; that the defendant was justified under the circumstances of this case in requesting the policeman not to interfere with his private affairs.<br\/><br\/>There is nothing in the record, in our opinion, which justifies the penalty imposed by the lower court.\u00a0 Therefore, the judgment of the lower court is reversed, and it is hereby ordered that the case be dismissed and that the defendant be discharged from the custody of the law, with costs <i>de oficio<\/i>.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

that the accused and his companions arrived at 8 p. m. and questioned them about carabaos that they said had been stolen from them; that after they replied that they knew nothing\", the former set fire to the house and they jumped out of it; that the witness and two companions lived in the house; that it was situated in an uninhabited place, surrounded by fields; that the nearest houses were far away, and cries could not be heard from one house to another; and that the\u00a0 burnt house was not worth more than Pl, because it was a small one, the witness himself having constructed it.<br\/><br\/>Celestino Vergara says that several individuals arrived at 8 o'clock at night, asked them for carabaos that they claimed to have lost, wounded Tranquilino Manipul, who was asleep, and Pedro Tabilisima, forced them to leave the house, and as they did not want to do so for fear of being assaulted the accused set fire to the same; they tried to put out the fire as long as they could, but when no longer able jumped out of the house.\u00a0 The house was in an uninhabited locality, in the fields, the nearest house being a small store to which the cry of a person might carry, and the neighboring houses could be seen.<br\/><br\/>Tranquilino Manipul testified in almost the same terms as this last witness.\u00a0 The argument which the defense advances, based on article 554, which in connection with 553 punishes the setting fire to a building intended for habitation, in an uninhabited place, does not apply, because the\u00a0 article in question refers to an edifice intended for human habitation in an uninhabited place at a time when the same is unoccupied.\u00a0 It is article 549, which punishes with the very severe penalties of <i>cadena temporal<\/i> to <i>cadena perpetua<\/i> \"those who shall set fire to any edifice, farmhouse, hut, shed, or vessel in port, with knowledge that one or more persons were within the same,\" that must be applied.<br\/><br\/>The law\u00a0 must\u00a0 be\u00a0 applied a's laid down in the above-quoted excerpt.<br\/><br\/>But the court, in view of the nature of the crime and considering the circumstances attending the same, recognizes the extreme severity of the penalty;

that several persons were candidates at said election for that office; that among them was Mauro Navarro; that after the polls were closed the board of inspectors proceeded to count the ballots cast for the various candidates for the office referred to; that the ballots were first taken by the defendant Serapio Artacho, who was president of the board of inspectors, and by him read aloud; that the other defendant, Pastor Moran, then took the ballots and verified the reading of Serapio Artacho; that the third inspector, Montano Casaclang, and the secretary of the board, Urbano de Guzman, made a record of the names of the candidates, with the number of votes received by each, in accordance with the reading of the defendant Artacho, as verified by the defendant Moran; that, at the termination of the count, the said board of inspectors made and signed the declaration of the result of the election, as required by law, in which they alleged that said Mauro Navarro had received 76 votes.\u00a0 It further appears from the proofs that the ballots were thereupon placed in the ballot box and the box sealed, as required by law, which said box was immediately thereafter deposited with the municipal secretary; that the box, after being so deposited, was kept by the municipal secretary in a place where it could easily have been tampered with by any person so desiring; that when the said ballot box was brought into court as evidence in this action, it was found that it had been tampered with; that some of the seals had been broken and one of the seals in particular, which consisted of a piece of white paper with the defendant Artacho's name upon it, tightly pasted upon said box so that it could not be opened\u00a0 without rupturing said seal, was a different piece of paper from the one with which the box was originally sealed, and that the name of the defendant Serapio Artacho, written across the said paper, was not his genuine signature, as was the signature written upon the paper with which the box was originally sealed.\u00a0 It further appears from the record that the defendant Artacho himself testified that the paper used as a seal had been changed after the deposit of the ballots and the subsequent sealing and that the signature upon the paper with which the box was sealed when produced in court was not his genuine signature, and was not the signature which he had written upon the original seal at the time the box was sealed at the close of the count.\u00a0 It appears also that, on opening the box containing the ballots, it was discovered that the original names on 17 of the ballots had been erased and in place of each thereof the name of Mauro Navarro written on each of said ballots; that the number of ballots received by Mauro Navarro, if the 17 mutilated ballots were counted for him, was 76; that, if the 17 ballots had not been counted for Mauro Navarro, he would have been defeated as candidate for municipal president.\u00a0 It also appears from the record herein that the defendant Artacho testified that the 17 ballots in question were not so erased or mutilated at the time he counted them as inspector of election.\u00a0 It also appears further that none of the names erased upon the said 17 ballots was the name of Mauro Navarro; that the name of Mauro Navarro, placed upon the 17 ballots after the erasure of the original names, appears to have been written by the same hand upon each one of the 17 ballots; that 7 of the said 17 ballots appear to have been originally in favor of Casiano Jimenez and the other ten in favor of the other candidates, whose names are Jose Lopez, Antonio Ramos, and Fernando Castro.<br\/><br\/>These facts are clearly and conclusively established by the testimony.<br\/><br\/>The evidence conclusively shows that the ballots were changed after the count.\u00a0 Artacho himself testified that the ballots were not so erased or altered when he read them.\u00a0 The third member of the board of inspectors, Montano Casaclang, and the secretary of the board, Urbano de Guzman, were occupied in putting down in the forms provided for the purpose the names of the persons who received votes for each office and the number of votes cast for each one, according to the reading of the names by the defendant Artacho, as verified by the defendant Moran.\u00a0 The inspector who was writing down the names of the candidates and the number of ballots which they received was so engaged that he could not see or know whether the acts of the two defendants in reading the ballots were correct or not.\u00a0 It is apparent, however, that each of the defendants had ample opportunity to see and know what the other was doing.\u00a0 It was the particular duty assigned to Moran to know what Artacho did, so that if the ballots were wrongly read by Artacho, that fact would be instantly known to Moran.<br\/><br\/>It is evident that some one erased the names originally upon the ballots and inserted in place thereof the name of Mauro Navarro.\u00a0 It is also evident that this change was made after the ballots were counted.\u00a0 This is substantially admitted by all parties.\u00a0 If that is true, then the defendant Artacho must have read the 17 ballots, one after another, wrongly, with the intention of giving Mauro Navarro 17 ballots which did not belong to him.\u00a0 This conclusion is inevitable.\u00a0 Also, if he read them wrongly, then Moran, who Verified the reading of Artacho, also read them wrongly, and he too, therefore, had the same intention when he read and counted for Mauro Navarro 17 ballots which rightfully belonged to other candidates.\u00a0 It is a necessary conclusion, based upon the evidence and all the circumstances of the case, that the ballots so wrongly counted were placed with the other ballots in the ballot box without changes having been made to make them correspond to the fraudulent reading; and that, after Jimenez had begun a proceeding to contest the election of the said Mauro Navarro, as he did, as shown by the proofs, the defendants, knowing that the fraudulent counting of the 17 ballots would be immediately discovered, took favorable occasion thereafter to open the box which contained the 17 ballots in question and to substitute the name of Mauro Navarro for the names that originally appeared on the 17 ballots.<br\/><br\/>It is evident, therefore, that the defendants, having so intentionally miscounted said ballots and having knowingly and wilfully certified to an incorrect return, are guilty of the crime charged, and the judgment of the lower court, convicting and sentencing them, is hereby affirmed, with costs against the appellants.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">On the 6th of February, 1907, Lino Paloma called at the post-office of the municipality of La Carlota, Occidental Negros, and delivered to Sebastian Misola, the postmaster in charge, a letter containing a 2 peso bill addressed to Jacinto Canton, a resident of Bacolod.\u00a0 The letter was registered as No. 44, as shown by the receipt issued by Misola on the same day, which receipt is offered in evidence as Exhibit E, and the letter was forwarded on the 8th of the same month.\u00a0 On the 12th of March following, however, as the addressee could not be found, the letter was returned from Bacolod to La Carlota in the registered packet\u00a0 No. 316 which appears as Exhibit F, and it thus remained at the post-office of La Carlota until the same was delivered to Paloma, early in February, 1908, by Juan de la Cruz, who had succeeded Misola in office on the 28th of the previous January.\u00a0 Misola, during the time the letter remained in the post-office stole therefrom the amount inclosed and when Paloma opened and examined it in the\u00a0 presence of the postmaster and of a telegraph operator he discovered that the 2 peso bill and the note advising the remittance of said amount were missing.\u00a0 On meeting Misola on the street on the evening of the same day he recovered the letter, he spoke to him about the loss of the money in-closed, and Misola thereupon offered to pay the P2 conditional on his taking no action in the matter.\u00a0 The injured party, in order to avoid trouble, kept silent for the time being, but as a matter of fact, Misola has never paid him the amount.<br\/><br\/>For the above reason a complaint was filed by the provincial fiscal on the 17th of March, 1908, with the Court of First Instance of Occidental Negros, charging Sebastian Misola with the crime of stealing mail matter, and the corresponding proceedings having been instituted, the trial court, after hearing the evidence adduced, entered judgment therein on the 15th of the following April, sentencing the accused to the penalty of one year\u00a0 eight months and one day of <i>prision correccional<\/i>, to pay a fine of 1,301 pesetas, to indemnify Lino Paloma in the sum of P2, and in case of insolvency as to the payment of the fine or of the indemnity to suffer the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment, to pay the costs, and to special disqualification from public office for a term of eleven years and one day.\u00a0 From this sentence the representative of the accused has appealed.<br\/><br\/>From the above-stated facts it appears that the crime of faithlessness in the custody of documents has been committed by a public official who was in charge of the post-office of the town of La Carlota, as defined and punished by article 360 of the Penal Code, inasmuch as it has been fully proven herein that after the sealed and registered letter which Lino Paloma gave the accused was returned from the Bacolod post-office to that of La Carlota, because Jacinto Canton, the addressee, could not be found, and after the same had been received sealed,, at the latter post-office in charge of the accused in March, 1907, he did not at once return it to the sender, Paloma, notwithstanding the fact that the latter had called several times at the office in order to obtain, as addressee, registered correspondence.\u00a0 The letter remained in Misola's possession for almost eleven months after its return, or until he ceased to hold office in January, 1908.\u00a0 It was only in the beginning of February when the new\u00a0 postmaster who succeeded the accused found the letter on the desk in the office and sent for the sender, Paloma, for the purpose of returning it to him, and the latter on receiving the letter noticed signs of its having been opened, and upon examination found that the 2-peso bill and the letter of advice were missing.<br\/><br\/>The reprehensible conduct of the accused, as well as the proven fact that he agreed to refund the amount which was missing on condition that the injured person did not report the matter to the authorities, conclusively establishes his guilt as the sole and convicted author of the violation of the mail, he having opened the said letter and stolen from it a 2-peso bill with a note of the remittance of the same, in addition to retaining and keeping it for nearly eleven months without returning it to the sender,\u00a0 in manifest violation of the criminal law.<br\/><br\/>In spite of the denial of the accused and of the explanations of his conduct made by him to exculpate himself from the charge, the data and other merits of the case fully show his responsibility for the commission of said crime and abuse of the confidence which the Government had reposed in him in appointing him postmaster of La Carlota.\u00a0 The mere fact of detaining the mail without forwarding the letters to their destination, or the changing of their ordinary route with malicious intent, for a purpose not authorized by the law or the regulations, even though without opening them, or rifling them of their contents, constitutes, <i>per se<\/i>, the crime of faithlessness on the part of the officer whose imperative duty it is to dispatch the mail to its destination without delay.<br\/><br\/>In the commission of the crime herein no mitigating or aggravating circumstance is present, and in view of the nature and character of the same it is considered that the sentence imposed in the judgment appealed from is in accordance with the law, although the penalty should be imposed in the medium degree:<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing it is our opinion that the said judgment should be affirmed, and we do hereby affirm it with costs, provided, however, that the penalty shall be one year eight months and one day of <i>prision correccional<\/i>.\u00a0 So

I., the party of the second part, do hereby agree to the following:\u00a0 First, that the party of the second part, or Ruperto Montinola, will take charge of the defense of the defendants in the cases entitled 'Carmen Javellana <i>vs<\/i>. Lucrecio Hofile\u00f1a and Candelaria Jabelona' and 'Carmen Javellana <i>vs<\/i>. Antonia Jayme pending before the Court of First Instance, and all the expenses for the court's fees, sheriff, and the printing of the bill of exceptions and brief shall be for account of the party of the first part.\u00a0 Second, that the party of the first part, or Lucrecio Hofile\u00f1a, in consideration of the professional services above mentioned, binds himself to pay to the party of the second part, or Ruperto Montinola, the sum of P750 up to this date to his full satisfaction, and the sum of 92,000, in addition thereto, in case the decision in the second instance, or in the Supreme Court, be in favor of the defendants.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>At the time of the execution of the contract, Hofile\u00f1a paid the plaintiff P700, and thereafter plaintiff acted as counsel for the defendants in the two cases mentioned in the contract.\u00a0 In the case of \"Carmen Javellana <i>vs<\/i>. Lucrecio Hofile\u00f1a and Candelaria Jabelona,\" judgment was rendered in the Court of First Instance in favor of plaintiff's clients, but the case did not come up on appeal, apparently as the result of a compromise between the parties, by virtue of which the second case mentioned in the contract was dismissed without being brought to trial, and the judgment in the above-mentioned case was allowed to become final without appeal.\u00a0 Some time afterwards Hofile\u00f1a, through his attorney, paid plaintiff the sum of P800, but thereafter declined to make any further payments, and this action was instituted to recover a balance of P1,200, which\u00a0 plaintiff alleges to be still due under his contract.<br\/><br\/>It will be seen by an examination of the terms of the written contract that it was made in contemplation of a state of facts which never arose.\u00a0 Plaintiff contracted to conduct certain cases in the trial court and the court of appeal, and in the event that he brought those cases to a successful issue in the Supreme Court he was to be paid a stipulated sum.\u00a0 Testifying in his own behalf, he said that \"when we made this contract we were under the firm belief that those cases would be taken to the Supreme Court, taking into consideration the natural, pretensions of both parties;\" and it is clear that in making the contract neither party contemplated final settlement by litigation terminating in the trial court, and presumably for that reason entered into no express agreement as to compensation for services in that event.<br\/><br\/>Plaintiff claims that what was really agreed to was that the defendant should pay the amount specified in the contract as soon as the judgment in the cases mentioned therein became final; but the language of the contract itself, when fairly construed, does not admit of such a construction, and it may fairly be assumed that the very substantial fee contracted for was agreed to by plaintiff's clients in contemplation not only of the necessity for services in the trial court, but for services to be rendered in the Supreme Court, to which the contracting parties believed the cases would be carried.<br\/><br\/>The conditions contemplated in the express contract between the parties not having arisen, and plaintiff not having rendered the services contemplated therein in accordance with its terms, it is clear that he is not entitled to recover upon the contract; and under the provisions of section 29 of the Code of Civil Procedure he is only \"entitled to have and receive from his clients reasonable compensation for the services rendered, with a view to the importance of the subject-matter in controversy, to the extent of the services rendered, and his professional standing as a lawyer.\"\u00a0 There is no evidence in the record on which we can base a judgment that plaintiff is entitled to compensation other than that which he has already received, for the services actually rendered by him.<br\/><br\/>The fact that one of the defendants paid P800 since the services were rendered is no evidence that the services were worth more than that amount together with the cash payment of P700 made at the time the contract was executed.\u00a0 The circumstances under which this payment was made do not appear, but it is clear that if it was\u00a0 paid under the erroneous impression that plaintiff was entitled thereto under the terms of the written contract, such payment in no wise binds him to make any further payment under that contract; and if it was made simply on account of services rendered, such payment is not in itself an admission that the services were more than that amount, or an agreement to pay more.<br\/><br\/>Plaintiff, testifying in his own behalf, says that some time after this payment was made Hofile\u00f1a verbally promised to pay the balance due upon the contract at a time fixed by him.\u00a0 It seems clear that this promise, if made, as plaintiff alleges, was made under the mistaken belief that plaintiff was entitled to recover the amount promised under and by virtue of the written contract; and it appearing that Hofile\u00f1a was not in fact bound by the terms of the written contract, and that no services were rendered thereunder, it is evident that defendant's\u00a0 alleged promise to pay\u00a0 the amount stipulated therein can not be enforced.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Albert E. McCabe, judge of First Instance, this 17th day of September, 1906, in Aparri, Province of Cagayan.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The following was indorsed on the back of the said summons :<br\/><blockquote>\"Office of the provincial sheriff.\u00a0 Aparri, September 17, 1906.-By virtue of the foregoing summons I, the sheriff for the\u00a0 Province of Cagayan de Luzon, First Judicial District of the Philippine Islands, called at the house of Maria Bidayanes in the barrio of Talungan, within the limits of this town, and personally notified her of the contents of said order to appear before the court; thereupon she acknowledged service, and I delivered to her a duplicate hereof, the receipt for which she signed together with myself.\u00a0 (Signed) Antonio Soriano, provincial sheriff, (Signed) Maria Bidayanes.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>On the 24th of September, 1906, the court entered a judgment containing the following statements: that the defendant Valentin Bal-latan was personally present, but that the defendant Maria Bidayanes was not, neither was she represented by counsel, notwithstanding the fact that she had been duly notified of the date set for the hearing of this case; that the clerk of the court called upon the defendant Maria Bidayanes by name, three times, in a loud voice, inside the court-room, and three times at the top of the staircase outside, and as the said Maria Bidayanes did not answer, the court proceeded to the trial of the case.\u00a0 And as conclusions resulting from the evidence:\u00a0 that in the month of December, 1904, the plaintiff was the owner and in peaceful possession of two <i>caraballas<\/i> and one calf, and that in the same month the defendant Valentin Bal-latan unlawfully took possession of one of the said <i>caraballas<\/i>, and the defendant Maria Bidayanes unlawfully took possession of the other, together with its calf; that after the commencement of the suit the defendant Valentin Bal-latan returned to the plaintiff the <i>caraballa<\/i> that was in his possession, and that the caraballa unlawfully taken from the plaintiff by the defendant Maria Bidayanes has had a second calf, and that the said <i>caraballa<\/i> and its two calves are now unlawfully in her possession; in consequence, the court sentenced Bal-latan to pay one-half of the costs of the proceedings, and Maria Bidayanes to return the <i>caraballa<\/i> and its two calves, and to pay the other half of the costs.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the defendant served a notice upon the attorney for the plaintiff couched in the following terms:<br\/><blockquote>\"This is to notify you that, under the affidavit, a copy of which is inclosed, we will ask the court on the 26th of September, 1906, at 9 a, m., or as soon thereafter as we may be heard, that the judgment in default entered in this case against the defendant Maria Bidayanes, and all subsequent proceedings be annulled and rendered ineffective, for the following reasons:\u00a0 the said defendant has never been summoned, nor has she been served with a copy of the complaint in this suit in the Court of First instance as provided by law.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>And the court below entered the following order;<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"This case was brought up for trial at the session of the court held in Aparri on the 6th day of April, 1907, for resolution of the motion presented by the counsel for the defendant, Maria Bidayanes, on the 26th of September, 1906, asking that the decision or judgment rendered in this matter sometime since be revoked and declared to be null and void for the reasons set forth in the motion and in the affidavit attached thereto.\u00a0 This court believes that the decision rendered in this matter can not be revoked and declared null and void by means of a motion of this kind, but that the proper procedure should be by appeal and before or by means of a motion for a new trial filed within the term fixed by law; therefore, the motion is overruled by this court.-So ordered.-Given at Tuguegarao, Province of Cagayan on this 12th day of April, 1907.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>Counsel for the defendant excepted to the above order and gave notice of their intention to appeal therefrom, and for the purpose\u00a0 of making up their bill of exceptions they indicated the following parts of the record:<br\/><br\/>The complaint filed with the justice of the peace.\u00a0 (There is no other.)<br\/>The judgment of the justice of the peace.<br\/>The appeal interposed by the plaintiff.<br\/>The notice served upon the defendant of the trial to be held on September 17, 1906.<br\/>The decision of the court.<br\/>The motion and affidavit, with exhibits presented by the defendant.<br\/>The order of the court below denying the motion.<br\/>The exception of the defendant to the overruling of the motion.<br\/><br\/>After submitting the bill of exceptions the appellant alleged the following errors:<br\/><ol><li>The fact that the defendant was sentenced without having been summoned to answer any complaint;<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>The fact that judgment was rendered without due process of law;<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>The fact that the said judgment entered in default against the defendant was not annulled.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<\/li><\/ol>All the foundation for these allegations consists in that section 75 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that a perfected appeal shall operate to vacate the judgment of a justice of the peace, and the action shall stand for trial <i>de novo<\/i> as if it had never before been tried, and in the present case no complaint had been previously filed with the Court of First Instance, as proven by the bill of exceptions submitted, which is a faithful transcript of the whole proceedings, and it does not appear that the plaintiff complied in any manner with the provisions of section 112 of the said law; and in that judgment was rendered in default, and there is no default where no complaint or summons had been served at the trial.<br\/><br\/>In the first place, the defendant appellant, as appears from the order which she herself has presented, was summoned on the 17th of September, 1906, to appear on the 21st of said month and year, at the trial of the above-entitled cause in the matter of a claim for the recovery of a carabao with calves;\u00a0 it was clearly stated that \"by virtue of the foregoing summons\" the sheriff went to her house, and it is explicitly stated that he notified her of the contents of said citation and summons and that she acknowledged the service.\u00a0 Moreover, section 397, the caption of which is \"What equivalent to service,\" provides:\u00a0 \"An acknowledgment on the back of the summons by the defendant * * * shall be equivalent to service.\"\u00a0 On the back of the summons appears the statement that the same was duly served.<br\/><br\/>If the summons was not accompanied by a new complaint, if a new complaint which might have been attached to the summons was not presented to the court <i>ad quem<\/i>-none of which matters can be established in this decision by the perusal of the bill of exceptions which, as stated therein, is composed of certain parts of the proceedings, and is not a transcript of the whole-yet it is not possible to maintain that the plaintiff acted in violation of section 112 of the Code of Procedure when said section authorized her, if she so preferred, to refer to the complaint that she had filed with the justice of the peace \"instead of presenting a new one.\"\u00a0 So that\u00a0 neither is it true that \"there was no complaint in the action.\"\u00a0 There was a complaint and there was a summons.<br\/><br\/>In the second place, even if there had been no complaint or formal\u00a0 summons, no law or reason whatever justifies the nonappearance of the defendant after having been summoned, inasmuch as even if it were for the purpose of challenging the jurisdiction of the court, or of alleging the nullity of the summons, she ought to have appeared and not have abandoned the action, filling then the motion which she did not make until after judgment in default had been rendered.<br\/><br\/>And in the third place, after judgment in default had been\u00a0 entered, the remedy open to the appellant\u00a0 was that authorized by section 55 of the Code of Civil Procedure, to wit, to ask that the\u00a0 judgment be vacated and that she be heard.\u00a0 She should have\u00a0 appeared and stated that her non-appearance in the action, which gave rise to the judgment in default, was due to fraud, accident, or mistake.\u00a0 This the appellant did not do.\u00a0 She merely claimed that the said judgment should be annulled on the ground of lack of\u00a0 summons, which is without foundation, and because of the absence of a new complaint, which she might have pleaded upon appearing in answer to the summons alleged to have been defective because it\u00a0 was not accompanied by a copy of the new complaint<br\/><br\/>From the fact that an appeal interposed against a decision of a justice of the peace annulls the entire proceedings had in his court, it does not follow, nor is it true, that a new complaint is necessary, as alleged by the appellant.\u00a0 According to section 75 of the Code of Civil Procedure, a perfected appeal shall operate to vacate the judgment of a justice of the peace, and the action when duly entered in the Court of First Instance shall stand for trial <i>de novo<\/i> upon its merits in accordance with the regular procedure in that court, as though the same had never been tried and had been originally there commenced.<br\/><br\/>For the reasons above set forth, the judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed with the\u00a0 costs of this instance against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson<\/i>, and <i>Willard, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><\/div>",

No. 5275, December 09, 1909<\/h2>\n<h3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, <i>VS.<\/i> ALEJANDRO BAUTISTA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>ELLIOTT, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">The defendant Alejandro Bautista was charged with the violation of section 315 of Act No. 355, known as the Philippine Customs Administrative Act.  A demurrer interposed to the information on the ground that it did not state facts constituting a public offense was overruled, and, the defendant was tried, found guilty as charged, and sentenced to imprisonment for one year in the public <i>carcel<\/i> at Bilibid, and to pay a fine of P500, and in the event of insolvency to suffer subsidiary imprisonment as provided by law.<br\/><br\/>Thereafter an application was made to reopen the case in order to allow the defendant to offer certain newly discovered evidence.  This motion was denied, and the case comes here on appeal.<br\/><br\/>It is contended by the appellant that the court erred in overruling the demurrer, and abused its discretion in denying the motion to reopen the case on the ground of newly discovered evidence.  The substance of the, various contentions of the appellant is that the information is defective because it does not allege that the officer or employee to whom the bribe was offered was on duty at the time; and that he had jurisdiction over the matter involved.<br\/><br\/>1.  The particular offense with which this defendant is charged is defined and described by section 315 of the Customs Administrative Act.  Every element of the crime is stated in the statute, and the information is therefore sufficient because it substantially follows the language of the statute, and clearly apprises the defendant of the offense with which he is charged.  (Commonwealth <i>vs.<\/i> Weiss (Pa.), 11 L. R. A., 653 (note); State <i>vs.<\/i> Howard, 66 Minn., 309, 34 L. R. A., 178.)<br\/><br\/>Omitting matter not applicable to the present case, we find that section 315 of Act  No. 355 provides that \"any person who shall give, or offer to give, or promise to give, any money or thing of value, directly or indirectly,. to any officer or employee of the Government of the Philippine Islands in consideration of or for any act or omission contrary to law, in connection with or pertaining to the importation, * * * or entry * * * of goods, wares, or merchandise * * * or * * * attempt to improperly influence any such officer or employee * * * as to the performance of his official duty\" shall be convicted and fined as therein provided.  The information in this case charges that the defendant \"did intentionally, illegally, and feloniously offer and promise money * * * to an officer or employee of the Philippine Government, to wit:  Jacinto Escolastico, member of the customs secret service duly nominated, qualified, and acting\" as such employee, on condition that said Jacinto Escolastico would permit said Alejandro Bautista to procure a quantity of opium * * * which was then and there  concealed upon the steamer Tean, then anchored in Manila Bay, the object of said Alejandro Bautista in making such proposition being that he might import said * * * opium into said city of Manila * * *  (intending) by means of said promise so made * * * directly to influence said officer and employee * * * and control him in the performance of his duties.\"  The Act penalizes the promise to give money to an officer or employee of the Philippine Government in consideration of an act or Omission on his part contrary to law, in connection with the importation of goods, or any attempt by such promise to influence or control any employee in the performance of his duties in connection therewith.  The landing of the opium by the  defendant would have been in violation of the general Customs Administrative  Act, as well as of Act  No. 1761.  The law imposes upon the Insular Collector the duty of enforcing the laws relating to commerce, navigation, and immigration, and to enable him to perform this duty he is authorized to appoint agents, and confer upon them authority to make arrests.  (Act No. 355, sees. 19, 25, and 320; Act No. 778.)  Section 20 of Act No. 367 expressly provides for and authorizes secret-service agents as a part of the personnel of the customs service.<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> These men are public officials charged by law with the duty of detecting and preventing breaches of the Customs Law.  (U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Tan Gee, 7 Phil Rep., 738-741.)  Under the liberal rules of criminal pleading which prevail in this jurisdiction, the powers and duties of the secret-service agents sufficiently appear.<br\/><br\/>2.  On the night of February 12-13, 1909, Jacinto Escolastico was on duty in Manila Bay within the 2\u00bd-mile limit of the city, engaged in the special work of preventing smuggling.  Two Hongkong steamers, the <i>Tean<\/i> and <i>Zafiro<\/i>, were at the time anchored in the bay.  About 2 o'clock in the morning, as Escolastico's launch was circling about these vessels, he observed three men in a <i>banca<\/i> near the ladder or gangway of the <i>Tean<\/i>.  As the launch approached, the <i>banca<\/i> slipped away among the cascoes and lighters which were lying about.  After a half hour's search Escolastico located the banca \"hidden under the bamboo covers of a <i>casco<\/i>.\"  The three men who had been in the <i>banca<\/i> had concealed  themselves in the bottom of the <i>casco<\/i>, and upon being discovered the defendant Bautista approached  Escolastico, and offered to pay him money if he would permit him to get certain opium from the <i>Tean<\/i>.  Escolastico testified that \"when I found this defendant, he approached me and asked me to let him go, and that he wanted to get from aboard the steamer some contraband, and if I would do so he offered to give me P250, and then I told him that that was a very delicate thing, and if my chief learned about it, it would be a bad thing for me and I would be punished.  I continued talking with this defendant, and I asked him in what part the opium was, and he told  me that it was in the bow of the steamer.  I asked him in what part of the bow.  He said it was in the general storeroom, among the cargo * * *  He told me that on the next day I could wait for him at the office of Smith, Bell &amp; Co., and he would give me the P250; or if I cared to, we could make an appointment somewhere else, and I didn't agree to it.  I took him to our office and delivered him to my immediate chief, Mr. Keith.\"<br\/><br\/>Escolastico also testified that Bautista told him that he was going to get one box or case of opium from the <i>Tean<\/i>.  This evidence is corroborated by that of Carlos Tuazon, who was engineer of the motor boat, and who overheard the conversation.  When taken to the office of the customs secret service, Bautista admitted in the presence of the witness Joseph Keith that he knew that there was opium on board the <i>Tean<\/i>, and  stated that he had made arrangements with a secret-service agent of the custom-house to allow him to land the opium.  No opium was in fact found upon the <i>Tean<\/i>, during her stay in Manila, but about 6 o'clock the next morning four large tins of opium were found floating in the bay some  distance from the <i>Tean<\/i>.  The fact that opium was not found upon the <i>Tean<\/i> does not deprive the act of, Bautista of its criminal character.  It is evident from his own statements that he believed that there was opium on the <i>Tean<\/i>, and it is probable that in this he was correct.<br\/><br\/>The motion to reopen the case was properly denied, because the so-called newly discovered evidence would atmost merely have tended to show that the opium found floating in the bay had not been taken from the <i>Tean<\/i>.  The facts if admitted would not necessarily have required the court to come to a different conclusion upon the question of the guilt of the defendant.  There was no abuse of discretion, and the judgment and sentence is therefore affirmed, with costs against the defendant.  So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Bingtoy and Catalino Marino, testified in support of the will, the latter being the justice of the peace of the municipality wherein it was executed; and their testimony was corroborated in all important details by the testimony of the proponent herself, who was present when the will was made.\u00a0 It does not appear from the record why the third subscribing witness was not called; but since counsel for contestants makes no comment upon his absence, we think it may safely be inferred that there was some good and sufficient reason therefore.\u00a0 In passing, however, it may be well to observe that, when because of death, sickness, absence, or for any other reason,\u00a0 it is not practicable to call to the witness stand all the subscribing witnesses to a will offered for probate, the reason for the absence of any of these witnesses should be made to appear of record, and this especially in cases such as the one at bar, wherein there is a contest.<br\/><br\/>The subscribing witnesses gave full and detailed accounts of the execution of the will and swore that the testator, at the time of\u00a0 its execution, was of sound mind and memory, and in their presence attached his signature thereto as his last will and testament, and that in his presence and in the presence of each other, they as well as the third subscribing witness signed the instrument as attesting witnesses.\u00a0 Despite the searching and exhaustive cross-examination to which they were subjected, counsel for appellants could point to no flaw in their testimony save an alleged contradiction as to a single incident which occurred at or about the time when the will was executed, a contradiction, however, which we think is more apparent than real.\u00a0 One of the witnesses stated that the deceased sat up in bed and signed his name to the will, and that after its execution food was given him by his wife; while the other testified that he was assisted into a sitting position, and was given something to eat before he signed his name.\u00a0 We think the evidence discloses that his wife aided the sick man to sit up in bed at the time when he signed his name to the instrument, and that he was given nourishment while he was in that position, but rt is not quite clear whether this was immediately before or after, or both before and after he attached his signature to the will.\u00a0 To say that the sick man sat up or raised himself up in bed is not necessarily in conflict with the fact that he received assistance in doing so; and it is not at all\u00a0 improbable or impossible that nourishment might have been given to him both before and after signing the will, and that one witness might remember the former occasion and the other witness might recall the latter, although neither witness could recall both.\u00a0 But, however this may have been, we do not think that a slight lapse of memory on the part of one or the other witness, as to the precise details of\u00a0 an unimportant incident, to which his attention may not have been particularly directed, is sufficient to raise a doubt as to the veracity of these witnesses, or as to the truth and accuracy of their recollection of the fact of the execution of the instrument.\u00a0 Of course, a number of contradictions in the testimony of alleged subscribing witnesses to a will as to the circumstances under which it was executed, or even a single contradiction as to a particular incident, where the incident was of such a nature that the attention of any person who was present must have been directed to it, and where the contradictory statements in regard to it are so clear and explicit as to negative the possibility or probability of mistake, might well be sufficient to justify the conclusion that the witnesses could not possibly have been present, together, at the time when it is alleged the will was executed; but the apparent contradictions in the testimony of the witnesses in the case at bar fall far short of raising a doubt as to their veracity, and on the other hand their testimony as a whole gives such a clear, explicit, and detailed account of all that occurred, and is so convincing and altogether satisfactory that we have no doubt that the trial judge who heard them testify properly accepted their testimony as worthy of entire confidence and belief.<br\/><br\/>The contestants put upon the stand four witnesses for the purpose of proving that at the time and on the occasion when the subscribing witnesses testified that the will was executed, these witnesses were not in the house with the testator, and that the alleged testator was at that time in such physical and mental condition that it was impossible for him to have made a will.\u00a0 Two of these witnesses, upon cross-examination, admitted that they were not in the house at or between the hours of four and six in the afternoon of the day on which the will is alleged to have been\u00a0 made, this being the time at which the witnesses in support of the will testified that it was executed.\u00a0 Of the other two witnesses, one is a contestant of the will, Macario Ubag, a brother of the testator, and the other, Canuto Sinoy, his close relative.\u00a0 These witnesses swore that they were in the house of the deceased, where he was lying ill, at or about the time when it is alleged that the will was executed, and that at that time the alleged subscribing witnesses were not in the house, and the alleged testator was so sick that he was unable to speak, to understand, or to make himself understood, and that he was wholly incapacitated to make a will.\u00a0 But the testimony of Macario Ubag is in our opinion wholly unworthy of credence.\u00a0 In addition to his manifest interest in the result of the investigation, it clearly discloses a fixed and settled purpose to overthrow the will at all costs, and to that end an utter disregard of the truth, and a readiness to swear to any fact which he imagined would aid in securing his object.\u00a0 An admittedly genuine and authentic signature of the deceased was introduced in evidence for comparison with the signature attached to the will, but this witness in his anxiety to deny the genuineness of the signature of his brother to the will, promptly and positively swore that the admittedly genuine signature was not his brother's signature, and only corrected his erroneous statement in response to a somewhat suggestive question by his attorney which evidently gave him to understand that his former answer was likely to prejudice his own cause.\u00a0 On cross-examination, he was forced to admit that because his brother and his brother's wife (in whose favor the will was made) were Aglipayanos, he and his other brothers and sister had not visited them for many months prior to the one particular occasion as to which he testified; and he admitted further, that, although he lived near at hand, at no time thereafter did he or any of the other members of his family visit their dying brother, and that they did not even attend his funeral.\u00a0 If the testimony of this witness could be accepted as true, it would be a remarkable coincidence indeed, that the subscribing witnesses to the alleged will should have falsely pretended to have joined in its execution on the very day, and at the precise hour, when this interested witness happened to pay his only visit to his brother during his last illness, so that the testimony of this witness would furnish conclusive evidence in support of the allegations of the contestants that the alleged will was not executed at the time and place or in the manner and form alleged by the subscribing witnesses.\u00a0 We do not think that the testimony of this witness nor any of the other witnesses for the contestants is sufficient to raise even a doubt as to the truth of the testimony of the subscribing witnesses as to the fact of the execution of the will, or as to the manner and form in which it was executed.<br\/><br\/>In the course of the proceedings, an admittedly genuine signature of the deceased was introduced in evidence, and upon a comparison of this signature with the signature attached to the instrument in question, we are wholly of the opinion of the trial judge, who held in this connection as follows:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"No expert evidence has been adduced with regard to these two signatures, and the presiding judge of this court does not claim to possess any special expert knowledge in the matter of signatures; nevertheless, the court has compared these two signatures, and does not find that any material difference exists between the same.\u00a0 It is true that the signature which appears in the document offered for authentication discloses that at the time of writing the subscriber was more deliberate in his movements, but two facts must be acknowledged:\u00a0 First, that the testator was seriously ill, and the other fact, that for some reason which is not stated the testator was unable to see, and was a person who was not in the habit of signing his name every day. <br\/><br\/>\"These facts should sufficiently explain whatever difference may exist between the two signatures, but the court finds that the principal strokes in the two signatures are identical.\"<\/blockquote> <br\/>That the testator was mentally capable of making the will is in our opinion fully established by the testimony of the subscribing witnesses who swore positively that, at the time of its execution, he was of sound mind and memory.\u00a0 It is true that their testimony discloses the fact that he was at that time extremely ill, in an advanced stage of tuberculosis complicated with severe intermittent attacks of asthma; that he was too sick to rise unaided from his bed; that he needed assistance even to raise himself to a sitting position; and that during the paroxysms of asthma to which he was subject he could not speak; but all this evidence of physical weakness in no wise establishes his mental incapacity or a lack of testamentary capacity, and indeed the evidence of the subscribing witnesses as to the aid furnished them by the testator in preparing the will, and his clear recollection of the boundaries and physical description of the various parcels\u00a0 of\u00a0 land set out therein, taken together with the fact that he was able to give to the person who wrote\u00a0 the will clear and explicit instructions as to his desires touching the disposition of his property, is strong evidence of his\u00a0 testamentary capacity.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for appellant suggests that the fact that the alleged will leaves all the property of the testator to his widow, and wholly fails to make any provision for his brothers or sisters, indicates a lack of testamentary capacity and undue influence; and because of the inherent improbability that a man would make so unnatural and unreasonable a will, they contend that this fact indirectly corroborates their contention that the deceased never did in fact execute the will.\u00a0 But when it is considered that the deceased at the time of his death had no heirs in the ascending or desending line; that a bitter family quarrel had long separated him from his brothers and sisters, who declined to have any relations with the testator because he and his wife were adherents of the Aglipayano Church; and that this quarrel was so bitter that none of his brothers or sisters, although some of them lived in the vicinity, were present at the time of his death or attended his funeral; we think the fact that the deceased desired to leave and did leave all of his property to his widow and made no provision for his brothers and sisters, who themselves were grown men and women, by no means tends to disclose either an unsound mind or the presence of undue influence on the part of his wife, or in any wise corroborates contestants' allegation that the will never was executed.<br\/><br\/>It has been said that \"the difficulty of stating standards or tests by which to determine the degree of mental capacity of a particular person has been everywhere recognized, and grows out of the inherent impossibility of measuring mental capacity, or its impairment by disease or other causes\" (Greene <i>vs.<\/i> Greene, 145 Ill, 264, 276); and that \"it is probable that no court has ever attempted to lay down any definite rule in respect to the exact amount of mental capacity requisite for the making of a valid will, without appreciating the difficulty of the undertaking\" (Trish <i>vs.<\/i> Newell, 62 Ill., 196, 203).<br\/><br\/>Between the highest degree of soundness of mind and memory which unquestionably carries with it full testamentary capacity, and that degree of mental aberration generally known as insanity or idiocy, there are numberless degrees of mental capacity or incapacity, and while on one hand it has been held that \"mere weakness of mind, or partial imbecility from disease of body, or from age, will not render a person incapable of making a will, a weak or feeble minded person may make a valid will, provided he has understanding and memory sufficient to enable him to know what he is about, and how or to whom he is disposing of his property\" (Lodge <i>vs.<\/i> Lodge, 2 Houst. (Del.), 418); that, \"To constitute a sound and disposing mind, it is not necessary that the mind should be unbroken or unimpaired, unshattered by disease or otherwise\" (Sloan <i>vs.<\/i> Maxwell, 3 N. J. Eq., 563); that \"It has not been understood that a testator must possess these qualities (of sound and disposing mind and memory) in the highest degree.\u00a0 * * * Few indeed would be the wills confirmed, if this is correct.\u00a0 Pain, sickness, debility of body, from age or infirmity, would, according to its violence or duration, in a greater or less degree, break in upon, weaken, or derange the mind, but the derangement must foe such as deprives him of the\u00a0 rational faculties common to man\" (Den. <i>vs.<\/i> Vancleve, 5 N. J. L., 680); and, that \"Sound mind does not mean a perfectly balanced mind.\u00a0 The question of soundness is one of degree\" (Boughton <i>vs.<\/i> Knight, L. R., 3 P. &amp; D., 64; 42 L. J. P., 25); on the other hand, it has been held that \"testamentary incapacity does not necessarily require that a person shall actually be insane or of an unsound mind.\u00a0 Weakness of intellect, whether it arises from extreme old age, from disease, or great bodily infirmities or suffering, or from all these combined, may render the testator incapable of making a valid will, providing such weakness really disqualifies her from knowing or appreciating the nature, effects,\u00a0 or consequences of the act she is engaged in\" (Manatt<i> vs.<\/i> Scott, 106 Iowa, 203; 68 Am. St. Rep., 293, 302).<br\/><br\/>But for the purposes of this decision it is not necessary for us to attempt to lay down a definition of testamentary capacity which will cover all possible cases which may present themselves, because, as will be seen from what has already been said, the testator was, at the time of making the instrument under consideration, endowed with all the elements of mental capacity set out in the following definition of testamentary capacity which\u00a0 has been frequently announced in courts of last resort in England and the United States; and while in some cases testamentary capacity has been held to exist in the absence of proof of some of these elements, there can be no question that, in the absence of proof of very exceptional circumstances, proof of the existence of all these elements is sufficient to establish the existence of testamentary capacity.<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"Testamentary capacity is the capacity to comprehend the nature of the transaction in which the testator is engaged at the time, to recollect the property to be disposed of and the persons who would\u00a0 naturally be supposed to have claims upon the testator, and to comprehend the manner in which the instrument will distribute his property among the objects of his bounty.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>(Cf. large array of cases cited in support of this definition\u00a0 in the Encyclopedia of Law, vol. 23, p. 71, second edition.)<br\/><br\/>In our opinion, the evidence of record establishes in a strikingly conclusive manner the execution of the instrument propounded as the last will and testament of the deceased; that it was made in strict conformity with the requisites prescribed by law; and that, at the time of its execution, the deceased was of sound mind and memory, and executed the instrument of his own free will and accord.<br\/><br\/>The order probating the will should be and is hereby affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellants.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson<\/i>, and <i>Moreland, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><\/div>",

Light (15 CaL, 324), which was delivered by Chief Justice Field, afterwards, for a long\u00a0 time, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.\u00a0\u00a0 In that case the court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"In 1857 the plaintiff recovered a judgment against Houck and Meyers for the possession of certain premises, situated in the city of Sacramento.\u00a0 From the judgment Houck appealed to the Supreme Court; and to stay its execution, pending the appeal, filed the undertaking upon which the present action is brought.\u00a0 The undertaking provides in the terms of the statute, that the defendants 'will not commit, or suffer to be committed, any waste thereon; and that, if the judgment be affirmed, they will pay the value of the use and occupation of the property, from the time of the appeal until the delivery of the possession thereof, pursuant\u00a0 to the judgment, not exceeding two thousand dollars.'\u00a0 By this undertaking, proceedings upon the judgment were stayed.\u00a0 At the January term of 1858, the appeal was dismissed by the Supreme Court, for want of prosecution; and the question presented for determination is, whether this dismissal was equivalent in law to an affirmance of the judgment, within the statute?\u00a0 Upon the solution of the question, the liability of the sureties on the undertaking depends.\u00a0 The court below held that the dismissal of the appeal was not such an affirmance of the judgment, and as hence there could be no breach of the undertaking, ordered a nonsuit.<br\/><br\/>\"The object of the undertaking was to retain the defendants in the ejectment, in the possession of the premises, pending the appeal, and at the same time to afford indemnity to the plaintiff for any loss he might sustain, by the deprivation of the use of the premises, or by waste committed thereon-if the judgment in his favor should not be reversed by the appellate court.\u00a0 The appellant, in fact, asserts a right to retain possession against the judgment, upon the ground that such judgment will be ultimately held invalid by the court to which he has appealed.\u00a0 Whether, then, the dismissal of an appeal is to be deemed equivalent to an affirmance of the judgment, will depend upon the question whether, after such dismissal, the judgment can be again open to examination.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The court, after an examination of its rules, held that the judgment could not again be examined and that it therefore became final and to all intents and purposes within the meaning of the statute was affirmed.<br\/><br\/>Under the law here in force there is no doubt that the dismissal\u00a0 of the appeal in this case for failure of the appellant to file his brief, ended the controversy.\u00a0 After such dismissal the defendant had no right to have the judgment against him reviewed in this court.<br\/><br\/>The same doctrine announced in the California court is also stated in the case of McConnel <i>vs<\/i>. Swailes, (3 III, 571).\u00a0 It was there said (p. 573):<br\/><blockquote>\"This court does not entertain a doubt but that the dismissal of an appeal, or certiorari, is equivalent to a regular, technical affirmance of the judgment, so as to entitle the party to claim a forfeiture of the bond, and have his action therefor.\u00a0 The bond given in such case is conditioned 'to pay the debt and costs, in case the judgment shall be affirmed, on the trial of the appeal.'\u00a0\u00a0 (R, L., 395; Gale's Stat, 409.)\u00a0 What is the object of this requirement, and what its meaning and intention?\u00a0 Manifestly to secure the opposite party in his debt and costs, in case the judgment shall not be reversed; in case he shall be, in the circuit court, the successful party.\u00a0 By a dismissal of the appeal, either by the court, or by the act of the appellant himself, the appellee is the successful party; he has not lost what he gained before the\u00a0 magistrate.\u00a0 He is placed in the same situation lie occupied before the appeal was taken; and we see no propriety in attributing to such a judgment of dismissal less efficacy than to a more formal and technical one of affirmance.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The judgment of the court below is.affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

DE LA ROSA, AND EUGENIO FERNANDEZ, TUTOR OF THE MINOR HEIRS OF THE SAID DECEASED, PLAINTIFFS AND APPELLEES,<i> VS.<\/i> JOSE FERNANDEZ FIDALGO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>JOHNSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">This action was commenced in the Court of First Instance of the Province of Pampanga on or about the 3d day of December, 1906, by the plaintiffs against the defendant for the purpose of having declared null and void a certain account allowed by the commission\u00a0 which was appointed for the purpose of considering claims against the estate of the deceased De la Rosa.\u00a0 The account allowed amounted to P17,234,27.\u00a0 The claim of the defendant was based upon two grounds:<br\/><br\/>First.\u00a0 That the said commission had no authority nor jurisdiction to consider a claim made by the plaintiff against the estate of De la Rosa; and<br\/><br\/>Second.\u00a0 By reason of fraud in the allowance of said claim.<br\/><br\/>From an examination of the record the following facts seem to be clearly established:<br\/><br\/>First.\u00a0 That in the early months of the year 1900, the deceased De la Rosa and the defendant entered into an arrangement by which they purchased and were to operate two cascoes, numbered respectively 1515 and 2089.\u00a0 The agreement also provided for a division of the profits resulting from the management of these cascoes. (See Fernandez <i>vs.<\/i> De la Rosa, 1 Phil. Rep., 671.)<br\/><br\/>Second.\u00a0 Some question arose as to the relation which existed between the deceased, De la Rosa, and the said Fernandez, concerning the right of the latter to participate in the profits resulting from the management of the said cascoes.\u00a0 This question was presented to the courts and was finally decided by the Supreme Court upon the 2d day of February, 1903.\u00a0 The Supreme Court held:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"* * * That a partnership was formed between the parties (De la Rosa and Fernandez) in January, 1900, the existence of which the defendant (De la Rosa) is bound to recognize; that cascoes Nos. 1515 and 2089 constitute partnership property, and that the plaintiff (Fernandez) is entitled to an accounting of the defendant's administration of such property, and of the profits derived therefrom.\" (Fernandez <i>vs.<\/i> De la Rosa, 1 Phil. Rep., 671, 678.) <\/blockquote><br\/>The Supreme Court ordered the case returned to the lower court for an execution of the judgment.\u00a0 The Supreme Court expressly declared that its decision did not involve an adjudication as to any disputed items of the partnership account, evidently intending\u00a0 to leave all disputed items of the partnership account to be settled in the further investigation of the cause by the lower court.<br\/><br\/>Third.\u00a0 After the said decision of the Supreme Court and on the 15th of April, 1903, De la Rosa died and one Carmelino Punsalan was appointed administrator of his estate.<br\/><br\/>Fourth.\u00a0 In accordance with the provisions of section 669 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions a committee was appointed for the purpose of hearing and allowing claims against the estate of the deceased De la Rosa.\u00a0 The exact date of the appointment of this committee does not appear.<br\/><br\/>Fifth.\u00a0 Later (the exact date not appearing) Fernandez Fidalgo, without waiting for a settlement of the partnership account, dismissed his original action, which had been returned to the lower court for an accounting of said partnership, and presented his claim against De la Rosa relating to said\u00a0 partnership to the said committee.\u00a0 The claim presented by Fernandez, showing the amount to which he was entitled as a result of the management of the said cascoes, amounted to P17,234.27.\u00a0 This claim was allowed by the committee.\u00a0 Later the said administrator, Carmelino Punsalan, resigned, which resignation was accepted June 30,1906, and the plaintiffs herein were then appointed administratrix of the estate and tutor of the minor children of the said De la\u00a0 Rosa, deceased, and on the\u00a0 3d day of December of the same year this present action was brought.<br\/><br\/>Sixth.\u00a0 It appears that at the time the said Fernandez Fidalgo presented his claim before the said committee, the then administrator, Punsalan, refused to present any proof whatever for the purpose of refuting the claim made by Fernandez, and in this the present plaintiffs now claim he acted in collusion with the said Fernandez and allowed a fraud to be perpetrated against the said\u00a0 estate, which this action was brought to set aside.<br\/><br\/>From the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause, it also appears that each of the cascoes from the very beginning required\u00a0 a great many repairs, and that by reason of their rotten and decayed condition they could be used but a small portion of the time.\u00a0 It appears also that long before any action was brought for the purpose of settling the partnership accounts between Fernandez and De la Rosa, each of the two cascoes was practically out of commission and had been for months.\u00a0 The claim of the plaintiff (Fernandez) was based upon the profits resulting from the\u00a0 management of the cascoes, assuming that they were in daily use from the commencement of the partnership until the action was commenced, and without taking into consideration at all the fact that great expense said cascoes.\u00a0 The books of De la Rosa were evidently in the possession of Punsalan.\u00a0 These books, if they had been presented, would, no doubt, have shown the real condition of the business resulting from the management of the said cascoes.\u00a0\u00a0 They were not presented.<br\/><br\/>It is not necessary to decide whether the first administrator (Punsalan) was in collusion with Fernandez in the presentation and allowance of his claim against the estate.\u00a0 It is sufficient to decide that the claim presented by Fernandez had not been sufficiently proven and that fraud had been perpetrated against the estate of the deceased De la Rosa.<br\/><br\/>The lower court also held that the said commission had no authority to consider the said claim of Fernandez.\u00a0 Upon this question the lower court said:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"It is the opinion of the\u00a0 court that the commission had no jurisdiction whatever to hear the claim.\u00a0 After the death of Francisco de la Rosa, Jose Fernandez Fidalgo was only entitled to demand an accounting of the management of the cascoes.\u00a0 He might have applied to the court to compel the administrator to render said accounts.\u00a0 The court would have compelled the latter to render them, and would even have removed him from office had he failed to fulfill the order of the court.\u00a0 Once the accounts were rendered, had they shown a balance against the estate and in favor of Jose Fernandez, the court would have compelled the administrator to pay the said balance and charged the amount of the same as administration expenses.\u00a0 An action brought to recover the outstanding balance after a iquidation made subsequent to the death of the deceased is not an action originating during his lifetime, and actions which arise after the death of a person can not properly be presented to such commission.\u00a0 (Philippine Trading Co.<i> vs.<\/i> Crossfield, 5 Phil. Rep., 400.)\u00a0 Therefore the court considers that the decision of the commission whereby the estate of De la Rosa is ordered to pay to Jose Fernandez Fidalgo the sum of P17,234.27 is null and void.\" <\/blockquote><br\/>The lower court, after a full consideration of all of the facts, declared null and void the resolution of the committee in respect of the claim of Jose Fernandez against the estate of De la Rosa, with costs to the defendant.\u00a0 From this decision of the lower court the defendant appealed and made the following assignments of error:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"1.\u00a0 The action brought by the claimant Jose Fernandez Fidalgo originated before the death of Francisco de la Rosa, that is to say, during his lifetime.<br\/><br\/>\"2.\u00a0 Under the law the commission has jurisdiction to hear and decide the claim of Jose Fernandez Fidalgo.<br\/><br\/>\"3.\u00a0 Under the law, the action of the claimant, Fernandez, can not be brought before the Court of First Instance.\" <\/blockquote><br\/>With reference to the first assignment of error, it will be remembered that the Supreme Court, in its decision above referred to, simply ordered that the lower court require an accounting of the said partnership and refused to pass upon any item of indebtedness between the parties in relation thereto.\u00a0 After the return of the case to the lower court Fernandez dismissed this action.\u00a0 The accounting was not made as directed.\u00a0 There was no proof or finding of facts that De la Rosa owed the partnership a single cent.\u00a0 There was no proof of any character showing that the\u00a0 partnership assets were not sufficient to cover all of its liabilities.\u00a0 The partnership had not been dissolved until after the death of De la Rosa.\u00a0 There was no accounting of the partnership business.\u00a0 Fernandez refused to proceed ,with the accounting ordered by the Supreme Court.\u00a0 There was nothing to show what had become of the partnership property existing at the time of the death of De la Rosa.\u00a0 So far as the record shows it may be even now in the hands of the surviving partner.\u00a0 Certainly no claim existed against the private estate of De la Rosa for the payment of the debts of the partnership until after the property of the.partnership had been exhausted, and no claim of this character is made.\u00a0 No debt of this nature had arisen before the death of De la Rosa.\u00a0 The claim of Fernandez\u00a0 was a claim against the partnership and not a claim against De la Rosa until the liquidation of the partnership business.\u00a0 The lower court committed no error, therefore, in holding that the said commission, appointed for the purpose of allowing the claims against the estate of De la Rosa, had no jurisdiction to consider the claim presented.\u00a0 (Philippine Trading Company <i>vs.<\/i> Crossfield, 5 Phil. Rep., 400.)<br\/><br\/>What we have said with reference to the first assignment of error we believe fully answers the second also, and there is no question, under the provisions of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions, that the Court of First Instance had jurisdiction to review, on appeal, the findings of the said commission.<br\/><br\/>It would seem to be clear that some one was guilty of a fraud against the estate of De la Rosa in allowing the present claim.\u00a0 The record does not clearly show who these parties were.\u00a0 It is sufficient, however, to set aside the claim when it is shown that a fraud had been committed.\u00a0 Courts of probate jurisdiction are very jealous in guarding the interests of the estates of deceased persons, and when the action of any party connected with the administration of such estates is tained in the slightest degree with fraud, such courts will take jurisdiction for the purpose of remedying whatever injury the estate may have suffered thereby.<br\/><br\/>For the reasons above stated the judgment of the lower court is hereby affirmed, with costs against the defendant.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

S. <i>vs<\/i>. Coates, 4\u00a0 Phil. Rep., 581; U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Valencia, 8 Phil. Rep., 729.)\u00a0 The offense, however, was committed after the enactment of Act No. 1740.\u00a0 The first and fourth sections of that Act are as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"SECTION 1.\u00a0 Any\u00a0 bonded officer or employee of the Insular Government, or of any provincial or municipal government, or of the city of Manila, and any other person who, having charge, by reason of his office or employment, of Insular, provincial, or municipal funds or property, or of funds or property of the city of Manila, or of trust or other funds by law required to be kept or deposited by or with such officer, employee, or other person, or by or with any public office, treasury, or other depositary, fails or refuses to account for the same, or makes personal use of such funds or property, or of any part thereof, or abstracts or misappropriates the same, or any part thereof, or is guilty of any malversation with reference to such funds or property, or through his abandonment, fault, or negligence, permits any other person to abstract, misappropriate, or make personal use of the same, shall, upon conviction, be punished by imprisonment for not less than two months nor more than ten years and, in the discretion of the court, by a fine of not more than the amount of such funds and the value of such property.\"<br\/><br\/>\"SEC. 4.\u00a0 Articles three hundred and ninety, three hundred and ninety-one, and three hundred and ninety-two of the Penal Code of the Philippine Islands, in so far as the same may be in conflict with this Act, are hereby to that extent only repealed.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>If the only law applicable to the case is Act No. 1740, the judgment must be affirmed, for the minimum penalty imposed upon a person who makes personal use of the funds of the Government is two months' imprisonment.\u00a0 There is nothing in the law which indicates that this penalty may be changed into a line in case the defendant restores the money to the treasury.<br\/><br\/>It has been suggested, however, that this is not the only law now applicable to the case, but that article 392 of the Penal Code is still in force.\u00a0 This suggestion is due to the peculiar wording of section 4 of Act No. 1740 above quoted.\u00a0 It seems to have been the opinion of the legislative body that articles 390, 391, and 392 of the Penal Code were not wholly repealed and that some part of them still remains.\u00a0 It may be difficult to point out just what part is left of these three articles, but this court has already decided that article 392 has been entirely repealed.\u00a0 In the case of The United States <i>vs<\/i>. Togonon,1 No. 4676, decided January\u00a0 19, 1909, the court, speaking of Act No. 1740, said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The purpose of the Act was the formal repeal of article 392 as to the distinctions and subdistinctions stated in said article and maintains the leading idea of the crime, distinguishing it from that of <i>estafa<\/i> committed by a private person.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>This result necessarily seems to follow from the fact that article 392 apparently supposes that the money misappropriated is returned and almost all of the article is devoted to a statement of the penalties which shall be imposed in such a case.\u00a0 The only part of the article which does not suppose a return of the money is the second paragraph, which says:<br\/><blockquote>\"If restitution be not made, the penalties prescribed in article 390 shall be imposed on him.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It is difficult to believe that the Commission, with their attention directed especially to article 392 and to the fact that its main object was to provide for a fine in case the money was returned, would not have expressly excepted the article from the repealing clause if it had been its intention to preserve that feature of the law.<br\/><br\/>The appellant claims that what was stated by the defendant to the auditor at the time of the examination amounted to a confession within the meaning of section 4 of Act No. 619, and no proof having been offered that the confession was freely and voluntarily made, it was inadmissible.\u00a0 Said section 4 is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"No confession of any person charged with crime shall be received as evidence against him by any court of justice unless it be first shown to the satisfaction of the court that it was freely and voluntarily made and not the result of violence, intimidation, threat, menace, or of promises or offers of reward or leniency.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It will be seen that this section relates only to a person charged\u00a0 with crime and can not, therefore, be applied to the present case because no charge had at the time of the conversation been made against the defendant.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below is affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

No such evidence appears in the case and the judgment can not be sustained so far as it relates to the hemp, rice, and aniseed spirit.\u00a0 As to the salt, the court found in favor of the defendant.<br\/><br\/>There was presented in evidence what purports to be an inventory of all the property connected with the business at Bulan on the 31st of December, 1904, but no witness testified as to the correctness of this inventory.\u00a0 Leopoldo Criado, a partner in the plaintiff company, who was in Bulan in the latter part of December, says that he did not make it.\u00a0 He stated that it was made by the defendant, but this he could not know because he said that he himself did not go into the warehouse where the property was.\u00a0 The defendant testified positively that he had nothing whatever to do with the making of this inventory.\u00a0 On cross examination he stated that the warehouseman counted the amount of stock on hand in the warehouses at Bulan and when asked if he was not present, he answered that he was in the office and that the persons who examined the property were Pedro de la Vega and Don Angel.\u00a0 Pedro de la Vega was a witness in the case, but made no declarations whatever relating to the inventory.\u00a0 The defendant did not sign the inventory and there is no evidence that he ever gave his consent thereto.<br\/><br\/>The other class of charges relate to money claimed to have been received by the defendant and not entered on the books, and to entries made on the books of money claimed to have been paid out by the defendant when, in fact, he made no such payments. The defendant in his brief makes the same point in regard to this class of charges as he made in regard to the shortage in the stock on hand.\u00a0 He says:<br\/><blockquote>\"There is no evidence introduced by the plaintiff to prove in a direct and conclusive manner that said amount was not really on hand, or, in other words, that the balance showed that the said amount has disappeared.\u00a0 Nor is there any proof tending to show that the balance resulting from said account did not belong to the amount found on hand or to.that which should be found therein if the sum of P3,000, delivered by Pujol, be included.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>And again:<br\/><blockquote>\"No balance of the funds on hand was presented, nor any inventory of the same.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>This claim, we think, must be sustained.\u00a0 The inventory above mentioned, Exhibit R, shows that the cash on hand on the 31st of December, 1904, was P4,096.27.\u00a0 As has been said, there is no evidence that the defendant took any part in the making of this inventory or ever consented to it as a whole, but we think there is evidence to show his consent to this particular item for on January 14, 1905, when lie definitely turned over to his successor the cash then on hand there is an item in the statement which he then signed to the effect that the amount of cash on hand on the 31st of December, 1904, was P4,096.27.\u00a0 But while it is proven that this amount was on hand, there is no proof to show what amount should have been on hand in accordance with the books of the company.\u00a0 There is nothing to show whether this amount of P4,096.27 was more than should have been on hand according to the books, or whether it was less.\u00a0 Before the plaintiff can charge the defendant with misappropriation of these items of cash, it must prove that there was an actual misappropriation.\u00a0 In other words, it must prove that that money has disappeared from the cash.\u00a0 This could only be done by showing what the shortage was at the close of business on the 31st of December, 1904.\u00a0 As has been said, there is no evidence to establish this point and the judgment in favor of the plaintiff with reference to these items can not be sustained.<br\/><br\/>We think, however, that the plaintiff should be given an opportunity to cure these defects and to make proof, if it can, upon these points.<br\/><br\/>We have noticed also that the proof was very deficient relating to the dealings with Marcos, Timoteo de Castro, and Aniceto Judit.\u00a0 The last person was not called as a witness.\u00a0 Marcos was a witness, but was asked no questions in regard to the items which the defendant claims lie paid to him, and which the plaintiff claims never were paid.\u00a0 The testimony of Timoteo de Castro was very general.\u00a0 He made no reference to the particular items claimed to have been received by him and the only denial made by him as to the truth of the entries by the defendant in the books is contained in a letter which was received in evidence without objection on the part of the defendant.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below is reversed and the case remanded for a new trial.\u00a0 No costs will be allowed to either party in this court.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

No. 4426, August 28, 1909<\/h2>\n<h3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, <i>VS.<\/i> BENITO FILOTEO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<sup style=\"COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> <br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">On the 20th of December, 1906, Eleuterio Matildo delivered to Benito Filoteo, postmaster in charge of the post office of the town of Oroquieta, Misamis, a letter containing a 10-peso bill and addressed to Gorgonio Boaqueno, Manila, to be forwarded by registered mail; Filoteo received the letter and issued the receipt which appears at folio 19, offered in evidence at the trial and marked Exhibit J.\u00a0 In view of the fact that after the lapse of one month no answer had been received from the addressee, Matildo called on Filoteo and spoke to him about said letter; the latter replied that probably the letter had not reached its destination but that he believed that it was then about due.\u00a0 However, a few days later Eleuterio received a letter from his brother, Gorgonio Boaqueno, complaining that he, Gorgonio, had received no letter from him, nor even an answer to the letter that he had written.\u00a0 It appears that the registered letter in question, numbered 153, had not been entered in accordance with the receipt on the stub marked \"Exhibit E,\" in case No. 941 of said court, and 4425 in the general register; and on comparing the handwriting and signature on the receipt marked \"Exhibit J\" with that in the book marked \"Exhibit E\" and the documents marked \"Exhibits A, B, and\u00a0 C\" in cause No. 908 of Misamis, and No. 4424 of the general register of this court, admitted as evidence herein, both appear to be in the handwriting of postmaster Filoteo.<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing, a complaint was filed by the provincial fiscal on the 16th of September, 1907, charging Benito Filoteo with faithlessness in the custody of documents, inasmuch as he had stolen, concealed, and destroyed a letter received by him from Eleuterio Matildo'for registration, profiting thereby to the extent of the P10 which the letter contained, to the serious prejudice of a third party and the public service, and in violation of the law.\u00a0 Proceedings having been instituted, the trial judge, after hearing the evidence adduced, rendered judgment on the 30th of September, 1907, sentencing the accused to the penalty of one year eight months and twenty-one days of <i>prision correccional<\/i>, to the accessory penalties, to a fine of P200, to the payment to Eleuterio Matildo of the sum of P10, and in case of insolvency in both amounts to suffer the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment, to special disqualification from public office for a period of eleven years and one day, and to pay the costs of the\u00a0 proceedings.\u00a0 From said judgment the accused has appealed.<br\/><br\/>It is a fully proven fact that the letter addressed to Gorgonio Boaqueno, a resident of Manila, delivered to Benito Filoteo on the 20th of December, 1906, to be registered and forwarded by mail from Oroquieta, Province of Misamis, and for which Filoteo issued, filled out in his own handwriting, and signed a printed receipt, has disappeared, and was not received in this city by the addressee, nor was the sum of P10 in paper currency which the said letter contained; therefore, there can be no doubt as to the fact that the crime of faithlessness in the custody of documents has been committed by a public official specially designated to look after and forward by mail, such letters, both ordinary and registered, as were deposited in the post-offices for dispatch to their destination, and the disappearance of said registered letter together with the money therein contained leads one to presume that it was stolen or destroyed in order to gain possession of and benefit by the amount contained therein, a crime covered by article 360 of the Penal Code.<br\/><br\/>The mere act of retaining mail matter and not forwarding to their destination letters deposited at the post-office, or the act of missending them by changing their ordinary route with malicious intent\u00a0 and for a purpose other than that which the law and regulations authorize, even without opening them or rifling their contents, constitutes <i>per se<\/i> the crime of faithlessness on the part of the officer whose imperative duty it is to dispatch public and private mails to their destination without undue delay.<br\/><br\/>The accused pleaded not guilty and absolutely denied having received the said letter from Eleuterio Matildo, repudiating and denying as his, the handwriting\u00a0 and signature which appears on the receipt marked \"Exhibit J,\" notwithstanding the fact that the sender of the letter testified that he had sealed it in the presence of the accused, who, after receiving it issued the receipt marked \"Exhibit J.\"\u00a0 The dispatch of the certified letter No. 153 mentioned in the aforesaid receipt, Exhibit J. does not appear in the book, Exhibit E, which was offered as evidence against the accused in another case, and which has also been admitted as evidence in the present case, but the handwriting and signatures appearing on Exhibit J are similar to or identical with the handwriting and signatures on the documents or receipts marked \"Exhibits A, B, and C,\" offered in evidence in case\u00a0 No. 908, tried before the same court, general register No. 4424 of this court, and were admitted as evidence in this case; besides, it has also been proved that the sender, Matildo, the holder of receipt marked \"J\" issued by the accused, had called at least twice at the post-office of Oroquieta, in charge of the accused, and, oddly enough, while postmaster Filoteo recognized and admitted as authentic all the books used in his office, he persistently refused to acknowledge or recognize the book marked \"E\" wherein all registered letters were\u00a0 entered.\u00a0 All of the foregoing facts and the merits of the case produce in the mind a full conviction, beyond all doubt, that the accused stole and destroyed the letter which figures in receipt marked \"Exhibit J\" in order to obtain the sum of P10 contained therein and to the prejudice of the sender thereof.<br\/><br\/>In the commission of the crime herein no aggravating or mitigating circumstances are present, and in view of the nature and character of the crime it is considered that the sentence imposed in the medium degree by the judgment appealed from is in accordance with the law and the merits of the case.<br\/><br\/>For the reasons above set forth it is our opinion that the said judgment should be affirmed as we do hereby affirm it with the costs against the accused.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Co. registered in the same office a trade-mark for a similar wrapper for cigarettes made with long-cut tobacco, manufactured by them under the name of \"La Valenciana.\"<br\/><br\/>The first-named company charged illegal competition, and brought the present suit against the latter, praying the court to issue a permanent injunction to restrain the company from using wrappers and selling cigarettes packed as described and shown by Exhibit 14 of the defendant company, claiming an indemnity for loss and damages to the amount of the profits unlawfully obtained by the use of a trade-mark similar to that of the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>The law under which this complaint was filed is Act No. 666 of the Philippine Commission, section 7 of which provides that:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"Any person who in selling his goods shall give them the general appearance of goods of another manufacturer or dealer, either in the wrapping of the packages in which they are contained, or the devices or words thereon, or in any other feature of their appearance, which\u00a0 would be likely to influence purchasers to believe that the goods offered are those of a manufacturer or dealer other than the actual manufacturer or dealer, and who clothes the goods with such appearance for the purpose of deceiving the public and defrauding another of his legitimate trade, or any subsequent vendor of such goods or any agent of any vendor engaged in selling such goods with a like purpose, shall be guilty of unfair competition, and shall be liable to an action for damages, in which the measure shall be the same as that provided for a violation of trade-mark rights, together with discretionary power in the court to impose double damages, if the circumstances call for the same *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>The Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, wherein the case was tried, in its decision set forth the following conclusions:\u00a0 (1) That the wrappers used by both the plaintiff and the defendant are of the same colors, to wit, red and green intermingled; (2) that even though there is a great difference in the details of the respective wrappings because the figure of the Spanish girl in \"La Sevillana\" is standing and wearing a hat, while in \"La Valenciana\" it is seated, with the head resting on one hand and without a hat, and on the reverse side the dissimilarities are still greater, \"yet, the color and the general design of the wrappers of the defendants are so similar to those of the plaintiff that, unless they are examined by a person who is able to read, he would be apt to believe that the cigarettes offered by the defendants are such as are manufactured by the plaintiffs, and the general public buying these\u00a0 cigarettes would thus be deceived\"\u00a0 (B. of E., 10).<br\/><br\/>The court found as a consequence that, inasmuch as the plaintiffs had registered their cigarette label \"La Sevillana,\" they are entitled to be protected against unfair competition, and that other persons should be prohibited from using labels resembling and bearing a general appearance to the goods known as \"La Sevillana;\" and that the plaintiff is entitled to recover as indemnity the amount of the profits which the defendants obtained from the sale of\u00a0 cigarettes put up in packets designated under the name of \"La Valenciana.\"<br\/><br\/>Therefore judgment was entered against the defendants, Francisco Chua Seco &amp; Co. and Francisco Chua Seco, prohibiting them forever from using the label which carries on one side the name of \"La Valenciana\" with the figure of a young Spanish woman wearing a Spanish mantilla, with its head reposing on the right hand and the right elbow resting on some boxes, and holding a cigarette in the left hand, and on the reverse a small coat of arms with the words \"Marca de fabrica\" and \"Fabrica de tabacos y cigarrillos\u2014hebra superior\u2014Francisco Chua Seco\u2014Manila,\" all printed in green and red, or a general design or a design that bears a general resemblance to the labels that are attached to the complaint as a sample.\u00a0 The defendants were sentenced to pay to the plaintiffs the sum of P82.62 as an indemnity for damages caused, with legal interest thereon from the date of the judgment, and the costs of the proceedings.<br\/><br\/>An appeal was interposed and submitted by bill of exceptions; and the same having been heard together with the briefs of the respective parties it now appears that the appellant has assigned the following errors in the judgment:<br\/><br\/>(1) In having considered therein that there was sufficient resemblance between the trade-mark of the plaintiff and that of the defendants;<br\/><br\/>(2) In having declared that the owner of a trade-mark duly registered in accordance with Act No. 666 is guilty of unfair competition, and<br\/><br\/>(3) In having recognized that the \"La Sevillana\" trade-mark is one of lawful use and is protected by the law.<br\/><br\/>In support of this last assignment of error the appellant invokes section 10 of Act No. 666, which provides that\u2014<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"The use of a trade-mark or trade-name by the assignee of the original manufacturer or dealer who first used and established the exclusive right to use such trade-mark or trade-name in his business, shall be lawful and shall be protected under this Act if the fact of the assignment from the original owner is shown in association with the trade-mark or trade-name wherever used by the assignee.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>Therefore\u00a0 as the appellee did riot set forth the fact of the assignment of the mark in use made by Baer, Senior &amp; Co., who originally registered it, it is claimed that it is not entitled to the protection of the law.<br\/><br\/>This alleged error has not been committed for the reason that section 10 of Act No. 666 above cited, is not applicable in this case.\u00a0 The question involved now is not one of protection of the ownership or use of a trade-mark against usurpation by another person, but of unfair competition against a trade-mark which has long been used by the appellee and which, even though it were not registered, deserves the protection of the law \"if the party complaining shall prove that he has used the trade-mark claimed by him upon his goods a sufficient length of time so that the use of the trade-mark by another would be an injury to him and calculated to deceive the public into the belief that the goods of that other were the goods manufactured or dealt in by the complaining party.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Act No. 666, sec. 4.)<br\/><br\/>The appellee states that it does not bring suit by reason of the usurpation of its trade-mark, nor does it raise any question as to the right of the appellant to his own trade-mark, nor object to such use as the latter may desire to make of the different details composing its label, which on being considered by themselves separately are perfectly legitimate, but which when united produce the general appearance of those which constitute his label, originating in this manner a resemblance that deceives the public.\u00a0 The appellee further says:\u00a0 \"We grant that the defendant is entitled to use red and green colors, and also the name 'La Valenciana,' and likewise to adorn his wrapping with the figure of a young woman, and to make exclusively his own any other element of his drawing; but it is denied that, by means of the conjunction of all of said elements or features, no matter how legitimate each may be separately, he has any right to imitate the general appearance of the plaintiff's wrapper.\u00a0 So that,\" he states in conclusion, \"either the defendant must print his present design in colors other than red and green, or alter it, and then the use of said colors will not be objectionable.\"<br\/><br\/>The colors are really what produce the exact resemblance, to wit, a green and red background in the same tones throughout the whole drawing; these are the striking features of each trade-mark, not the details, border, lines, and ornamentation of each; at a certain distance these do not stand out so clearly as the colors of the pictures forming the obverse and the reverse sides of the wrapper of each packet.\u00a0 There is perfect similarity in the tone, combination, and tint of colors in both trade-marks, and it is a matter of small importance whether the emblematic figure, the <i>Sevillana<\/i>, be svelt and with a fine head in one of the trade-marks, while the <i>Valenciana<\/i> appears to be heavier and much larger about the bust; at a distance these figures are not of such importance as the general appearance and the respective names of \"La Sevillana\" in one, and \"La Valenciana\" in the other, with embossed letters of the same character and on the upper part of the label.\u00a0 Upon this ground, taking the mark as a\u00a0 whole, the general aspect of the pictures, and the green and red colors, is based the charge of intent to imitate.<br\/><br\/>The intention is inferred from the following:\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 The defendant company only registered its trade-mark in black and white; such was the only design that was attached to its petition for registration, and the only trade-mark that has been registered, although it is true that it stated in one line of the petition:\u00a0 \"This trade-mark will be used in different tints and colors;\" (2)\u00a0 the chief of the division of registration testified that the petitioner presented his trade-mark in green and red, and that his attention was called to the resemblance, and he then declined to admit the mark because the colors were the same as those of the trade-mark previously registered, in 1904, in favor of Baer, Senior &amp; Co., and Francisco Tan Chueco [Chua Seco], the manager of the defendant company, states\u00a0 that he did really present the mark in five colors, as shown by his exhibits numbered 14 to 18, and that the chief of the division of registration told him that there were too many colors; that a different title should be offered for each color, that for each color and title the corresponding registration fees should be paid; and therefore, as all this would cause too much inconvenience, he decided to register it only in black; (3) that according to said Tan Chueco [Chua Seco], once that the trade-mark had been registered in black, he caused it to be printed in five colors as shown by the samples submitted, numbered 14 to 18, and that he put out cigarettes with trade-marks of the different colors, and found that the colors of sample No. 14 were the most favorably received by the public, for which reason he decided to use them.<br\/><br\/>Said colors are precisely those of the trade-mark registered by the plaintiff company since 1904, and without such prestige, as the appellant himself states in his brief, the colors <i>adopted<\/i> would not have met with such ready acceptance in preference to the other four labels offered to the public.\u00a0 It is thus fully demonstrated that it is the colors of the label, not the kind of tobacco, nor the drawings of the label that catch the eye and as a rule induce the purchase.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, the first alleged error, in so far as it was held in the judgment that sufficient similarity existed between the trade-mark of the plaintiff and that,of the defendant to deceive the public, has not been committed.<br\/><br\/>Nor has the second alleged error been committed, in so far as the judgment concludes that a person whose trade-mark is duly registered may be guilty of unfair competition.<br\/><br\/>A registered trade-mark is no more than <i>prima facie<\/i> evidence that the person who has it is the owner, and in the present case there is no question as to the ownership of the mark.\u00a0 Unfair competition by reason of the deceitful appearance need not necessarily consist of the technical part of trade-marks; it may arise simply from the general resemblance of the packet, of the emblems or the words thereon, even though under the law they are not trade-marks as prescribed by the above-cited section 7 of Act No. 666.<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing it would not be proper to issue a perpetual injunction enjoining the defendant company and the members thereof from using its trade-mark such as presented for registration and as now registered, and in proper colors, with the exception of the following prohibition.<br\/><br\/>It is proper, however, to grant an injunction prohibiting the defendant company and the members thereof from using the green and red colors in the form, tone, tint, and combination presented in their trade-mark, according to their Exhibit No. 14, or to the copy attached to the complaint, resembling as a whole, and in general appearance, that of the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, with the foregoing modification, the judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed with the costs of this instance against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa, Carson,<\/i> and <i>Moreland, JJ.,<\/i> concur.<\/div>",

MONTAGUE, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">Victoria Garcia, a resident of Moncada, Tarlac, represented by her lawyer, filed a complaint on the 4th of June, 1907, against B. Montague, alleging that in December, 1904, in view of the asseverations of the latter that he belonged to the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church, and that he would marry the petitioner in accordance with the rites of said church she engaged to become his wife.\u00a0 Believing his assurance that it was customary with Americans first to celebrate a civil marriage and immediately afterwards a religious ceremony, she consented to the celebration of the civil marriage between them, which took place on the 9th of February, 1905.\u00a0 She then demanded the immediate performance of the religious ceremony as had been previously agreed upon.\u00a0 The defendant, however, after giving evasive answers, finally acknowledged that he did not belong to the Roman Catholic Church, and in doing so expressed himself in terms which were offensive to her honor and dignity, adding that the Roman Church neither had, nor ever would have, any authority over him.\u00a0 He had told her that he was a Catholic for the purpose of obtaining her consent to the civil marriage, but that he had never intended to solemnize it according to the rites of the Catholic Church as he had promised; that the plaintiff, considering that her consent to the civil marriage had been obtained by means of deceit, informed the defendant that she did not consider herself married to him, and that, therefore, she would refuse to live with him and abandon the home of her parents, and in effect she refused to accompany him as his wife; that since that time two years have elapsed, and the defendant still refuses to consummate the promised ceremony in accordance with the rites of the Catholic Church; that she has lived with her parents for the said two years without ever having gone to the house of the defendant, and that during that space of time the plaintiff has not been maintained by the defendant either directly or indirectly; therefore, in view of the fact that her consent was obtained by means of deceit, she prayed, in accordance with the provisions of General Orders, No. 68, that the said marriage be declared null and void, together with such further legal remedies as may be proper in equity and justice, with costs against the defendant.<br\/><br\/>In the affidavit attached to the foregoing complaint it appears that the defendant, B. Montague, consented and gave his permission by means thereof to the filing of the complaint by the plaintiff's lawyer on behalf of the plaintiff with the Court of First Instance of the Province of Pampanga, instead of that of Tarlac, and that the trial be held in the said court of Pampanga; this consent was ratified by the defendant Montague before the notary public of Batangas on May 2, 1907.<br\/><br\/>The defendant was summoned on the 15th of June following, and on the 8th of July he presented his answer, setting forth that he admitted the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the complaint but denied each and every one of the others; he therefore prayed the court to dismiss the complaint with costs.<br\/><br\/>The defendant not having appeared on the 5th of August, 1907, the day appointed for the trial, as agreed upon by the contending parties, the plaintiff moved that the trial be held in the absence of the defendant who, in a letter which was offered in evidence by the plaintiff, as Exhibit A, stated that he would not be able to appear in court on the said 5th day of August; thereupon the court below ordered the trial to be held as prayed for by the plaintiff, who, on her part, duly offered oral and documentary evidence.\u00a0 The court entered judgment on the 26th of November, 1907, absolving the defendant from the complaint with the costs against the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>From this judgment the plaintiff\u00a0 excepted, and by another writing dated December 14, moved for the reopening of the case and reversal of the judgment appealed from for reasons of accident or fraud which ordinary prudence could not have avoided, for which reasons the petitioner had suffered in her rights, and because the evidence did not sufficiently warrant the decision of the lower court, which decision was furthermore contrary to law.\u00a0 An affidavit was attached to this writing wherein the plaintiff, Victoria Garcia, stated under oath that, on the 28th of July, 1907, before the trial took place, the defendant informed her that he would make no opposition to her complaint, and that her own testimony would be sufficient proof in the same manner as a similar case brought before the Court of First Instance of Leyte, a copy of whose decision was offered in evidence as Exhibit B at the trial held on the 5th of August of the previous year; believing that said proof was sufficient she had made no efforts to obtain the testimony of other witnesses; hence, in a new trial she would be able to establish new facts by the testimony of witnesses, such as that the defendant had assured her that he was a Catholic, and that the religious ceremony would immediately follow the civil marriage, inasmuch as she could prove said facts by means of her father, Manuel Garcia, and Diego Gloria, a witness of her wedding, and the\u00a0 defendant himself, Montague, whose statements were certified to by a notary public residing in San Fernando, Pampanga, on the 11th of December, 1907.<br\/><br\/>On the 19th of December, 1907, the defendant stated in writing that he had been informed of the petitions presented by the plaintiff to the court below praying for the reversal of the judgment entered in the case, and for the reopening thereof, and also of the proposed exception to the said judgment; that being agreeable to said requests he prayed the court to be pleased to grant the plaintiffs petitions.\u00a0 By an order of March 12, 1908, the court below overruled the motion for the reopening of the case and held that the judgment rendered therein was sufficiently justified by the evidence; from said decision the petitioner excepted and presented in due course the corresponding bill of exceptions.<br\/><br\/>The question involved in this case is the annulment of a marriage celebrated between the contending parties on the 9th of February, 1905, before the justice of the peace of Batangas, by reason of the consent of the plaintiff having been obtained by means of fraud or deceit; to this end the plaintiff bases her claim on the provisions of paragraph 4 of section 10, General Orders, No. 68, of the 18th of December, 1899.<br\/><br\/>Marriage is a contract entered into in the manner and with the solemnities established by the said General Orders, No. 68, as far as its civil effects are concerned, and in order that it may be valid and efficient the consent of the contracting parties, among other requisites, is essential.\u00a0 (Art. 1261, Civil Code.)\u00a0 Consent given through error, violence, intimidation, or deceit shall be void.\u00a0 (Art. 1265.)\u00a0 There is deceit when, by words or insidious machinations on the part of one of the contracting parties, the other is induced to execute a contract which without them he would not have entered into.\u00a0 (Art. 1269.)<br\/><br\/>In order that the courts may make the declaration of nullity claimed by the plaintiff by reason of fraud or deceit, it is indispensable that it be shown in a satisfactory manner, that the defendant gained her consent to the marriage by means of fraud or deceit, that is, that the fraudulent representations of B. Montague actually induced her to contract marriage in the firm belief that they were true.<br\/><br\/>The court below found that the evidence adduced in the proceedings was insufficient to prove that the fraudulent statements were made by the defendant, and the record offers no legal reason whatever to authorize the belief that the provisions of section 273 of the Code of Civil Procedure have been violated in the consideration of the evidence adduced.<br\/><br\/>The question involved herein being the annulment of a marriage, held with the formalities of law and before a justice of the peace, the acquiescence of the contracting party, to whom fraudulent conduct is attributed, is not sufficient; it is necessary that from the trial it appear fully proven that the plaintiff who claims the annulment gave her consent as a result of the fraud or deceit practiced on her, and which directly induced her to contract marriage with the person who availed himself of such fraudulent means in order to persuade her to celebrate an act which was of such far-reaching effects in her life, and which caused a change in her status.<br\/><br\/>As to the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance of Pampanga, even though this point was not discussed in the court below, it i&amp; certain that the defendant, B. Montague, agreed to and acquiesced in the plaintiff's solicitation to have the matter brought before the Court of First Instance of Pampanga, notwithstanding the fact that he resided in the Province of Batangas; for this reason the judge of Pampanga was able to hear and decide this litigation.<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing and considering that the judgment appealed from is in accordance with the law and the merits of the case, it is our opinion that the same should be and it is hereby affirmed, with the costs against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Rep., 66), United States <i>vs.<\/i> Roque (1\u00a0 Phil. Rep., 372), United States <i>vs.<\/i> Buenaventura (1 Phil.\u00a0 Rep., 428), United States <i>vs.<\/i> Leyson (5 Phil. Rep., 447), United States <i>vs.<\/i> Sayson (6 Phil. Rep., 382), and United States <i>vs.<\/i> Angeles (6 Phil. Rep., 435).<br\/><br\/>In this instance the Attorney-General very rightly observes that none of the above-cited\u00a0 decisions apply in the present case.<br\/><br\/>In the cause against Paraiso the doctrine is established that \"the agent of a mercantile concern who signs false receipts with the name of a third person is not guilty of falsification under articles 300 and 304 of the Penal Code if he does not attempt to imitate the signature or mark of that person.\"\u00a0 In that against Roque:\u00a0 \"The signing of another's name to a receipt with design to deceive does not constitute falsification unless there is an attempt to imitate the genuine signature.\"\u00a0 In that against Buenaventura:\u00a0 \"When no attempt has been made to imitate the <i>signature<\/i> or writing\u00a0 of another, there can be no conviction for falsification * * *.\"\u00a0 And in that against Leyson:\u00a0 \"Leyson did then and there counterfeit and <i>feign the signature<\/i> of J. Y. McCartey * * *.\"\u00a0 In all of the foregoing decisions the matter at issue has been the falsification of signatures.<br\/><br\/>The case at bar has not to do with the falsification of a signature, nor is it necessary to inquire whether or not an attempt was made to imitate the signature or writing which constitutes the sign of authenticity, or reason for according credit to the document.\u00a0 The falsified documents in question are printed ones.\u00a0 The blanks that are filled out in this class of documents with the name of the taxpayer, the location of the property and certain figures, need not, nor can they be imitated, inasmuch as their authenticity lies in the issue thereof by an officer authorized by law so to do, and in the stub from which the same are detached when lawfully issued.\u00a0 As the complaint states, the documents exhibited in the case are genuine ones, the falsification consists in that the truth therein contained has been altered.<br\/><br\/>In the cases against Sayson and Angeles, this Supreme Court has established the doctrine that the falsification of seals, or of certificates of ownership of cattle, is not punished under article 301 in connection with article 300 of the Penal Code, but by article 311, as in the case of Sayson, and 312 as in that of Angeles.<br\/><br\/>The above cases refer to special kinds of falsification, different from the eight general forms specified in article 300.\u00a0 In none of them has reference been made to any acts that might be qualified as <i>estafa<\/i> but to acts that purely and simply constitute the crime of falsification.<br\/><br\/>The established rule has been constantly maintained, both in Spain and in its colonial possessions, as well as by the Supreme Court in these Islands in punishing, under paragraph 1 of article 300, the counterfeiting or feigning of a signature, writing, or rubric, only when an attempt is made to imitate the signature, writing, or rubric of a person in order to induce another to accept the document as written, signed, or rubricated by the former.\u00a0 Counterfeiting consists in making one thing so similar to another that they can only be distinguished with difficulty.\u00a0 To feign a signature, writing, or\u00a0 rubric is to imitate the same.\u00a0 Where the imitation is such that anyone would mistake it for the signature, writing, or rubric that was imitated, the crime of falsification is committed as defined by paragraph 1 of article 300 of the Penal Code.\u00a0 Where said imitation is not complete, or, when there is no imitation, and the signature, writing, or rubric does not appear counterfeited, but the issuance or execution of a document is merely supposed to have been done by a certain person, then the case defined by article 300 does not apply.<br\/><br\/>All the foregoing and elemental doctrine does not apply in the present case; the question is not whether the accused counterfeited or feigned the signature, writing, or rubric of some person, nor had he any necessity to imitate another's writing.\u00a0 By substituting the name of <i>Angelo Cirio<\/i> for that of <i>Dionisio Austero<\/i> he did not counterfeit or feign any signature, writing, or rubric whatever.\u00a0 What he did do was to foist a printed document as a receipt to Angelo Cirio for the payment of the land tax for 1903; it was not a false one by reason of the fiction of the signature, writing, or rubric appearing thereon, but a real and authentic one issued in favor of Dionisio Austero as a voucher of a payment made by him in 1902 for his land tax.\u00a0 He who shall feign the handwriting of a document, thereby attempting to cause others to believe that it was written by a given person, or imitates the signature or rubric of said person in order to induce the belief that it was drawn by him, utters a false document.\u00a0 But a document genuine in every respect, made out\u00a0 in favor of Dionisio Austero, but which subsequently turns out to\u00a0 be false because in lieu of said name, that of Angelo Cirio has been inserted, is not a false document by reason of the counterfeiting or feigning of the signature, writing, or rubric of any person, but by reason of the alteration made thereon and which is punished under paragraph 6 of article 300 above cited.<br\/><br\/>The Attorney-General has therefore in this instance very properly applied the doctrine set up by two decisions of this court, and by another of the supreme court of Spain which, and especially the latter, are conclusive in defining the responsibility of the culprit, the extent and the manner of applying the penalty.<br\/><br\/>In the case of the United States <i>vs.<\/i> Victoria (9 Phil. Rep., 81) although it deals with the crime of falsification of a private document, while in the present case the falsification of a public one is involved, the fundamental doctrine is the same.\u00a0 Victoria had altered an account which called for the sum of P10 by substituting a \"3\" for the \"1\" so as to make it appear \"P30\" instead of \"P10,\" and had collected P30 from the payor of the account; he was a clerk in a commercial firm to which he, however, only handed P10, profiting thereby to the extent of P20.\u00a0 \"The fact,\" as this court said, \"involves the characteristics of the crime of <i>estafa<\/i>, besides that of falsification, which served as the means for its commission, because by adopting deceitful means he obtained a price which he would not otherwise have secured by telling the truth.\"<br\/><br\/>The above decision has nothing to do with the previous ones even as paragraph 6 of article 300 of the Penal Code has nothing to do with paragraph 1 thereof.\u00a0 A document is not falsified in one manner only; according to the said article there are eight; each paragraph indicates 'a different species, and clearly the various species within the class must necessarily differ from each other, as each is a specific variation in the class, or type of crime.<br\/><br\/>In the decision rendered in the case of the United States <i>vs.<\/i> Llames (1 Phil. Rep., 130), the court held:\u00a0 \"The writing of a false receipt by an employee of the revenue department for the purpose of embezzling the amount is a necessary means for the commission of the latter offense and the penalty is that of the higher offense, to wit, that of falsification.\"<br\/><br\/>The decision rendered by the supreme court of Spain on the 14th of December, 1888, reads as follows:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"An employee of a city government (<i>Ayuntamiento<\/i>) who alters the figures in a warrant officially issued for the payment of municipal obligations, and by said means unlawfully appropriates a certain sum of money, commits the crime of <i>estafa<\/i> defined by paragraph 1 of article\u00a0 547 of the Penal Code of Spain (art 534 of that of the Philippines), through the falsification of an official document as included in article 315 (301 of that of the Philippines).\u00a0 Since the falsification was a necessary means to commit the <i>estafa<\/i>, article 90 of the code (89 of that of the Philippines) must of necessity be applied to the case in order to impose, in strict compliance therewith, the penalty for the more serious crime in its maximum degree.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>The <i>estafa<\/i> committed by this accused consisted of the gain which, by deceitful means, he obtained from a hog valued at P45, a\u00a0 sum less than 250 pesetas.\u00a0 This is punished by the code with the penalty of <i>arresto mayor<\/i> in its minimum and medium degrees.<br\/><br\/>The deceit consisted in the delivery of a true printed official document, which was a land-tax receipt issued to Dionisio Austero for the year 1902; the accused changed the name written thereon to that of Angelo Cirio so as to make it appear as a receipt for the land tax due by the latter, as if he had paid it for the year 1903 or 1904; he thus committed the falsification defined in paragraph 6 of article 300, which consists of making\u00a0 any alteration or interlineation in a genuine document which alters its meaning, and \"which is punished with <i>presidio mayor<\/i> and a fine of from 1,250 to\u00a0 12,500 pesetas.\"<br\/><br\/>But inasmuch as under article 89 where one of the crimes is the necessary means for committing the other, only the penalty corresponding to the more serious crime shall be imposed in its maximum degree, and as the maximum degree of <i>presidio mayor<\/i> is from ten years and one day to twelve years, the penalty of eleven years and one day of <i>presidio mayor<\/i> should be imposed on the accused herein.<br\/><br\/>The Court of First Instance of Albay which tried the case sentenced the accused to eight years and one day of <i>presidio mayor<\/i>, to the accessory penalties, to pay a fine of 1,250 pesetas, to make restitution of the hog to Barbara Cirio or otherwise pay P45, the value of the same, and to pay the costs.<br\/><br\/>From the said judgment the accused has appealed.<br\/><br\/>It being understood that the main penalty shall be eleven years and one day of <i>presidio mayor<\/i> the judgment appealed from is\u00a0 otherwise affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson<\/i>, and <i>Moreland, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><\/div>",

The plaintiffs' marks were registered on the 25th of August, 1903, and consequently under the provisions of section 15 of the Act they, <em>prima facie<\/em>, have the exclusive right to use them. The defendant claims that his two marks are not imitations of the plaintiff's marks. Exhibits A and B, the two marks of the plaintiffs, are as follows: [See 13 Phil. Rep., pages 144, 145.] <p>NOTE.\u2014In the original designs, plaintiffs' exhibits A and B, the words <em>\"Ginebra Ginete\"<\/em> and <em>\"Ginebra Honrada\"<\/em> are in white upon a black ground. The single horse and rider are in black and white, and on the mark showing two horses, one is white and the other black, both on a red ground with the words <em>\"Marca Registrada\"<\/em> in white letters. The words <em>\"Superior Calidad,\" \"Clase Superior,\"<\/em> and <em>Song Fo y Ca.\"<\/em> are in white letters on a red field. <em>\"S. F. &amp; Co.\"<\/em> and <em>\"Dos Caballos\"<\/em> are in black letters upon a strip of white, and <em>\"Manila\"<\/em> in white upon a black scroll. The two groups of medals are in gold with black inscriptions, with the words immediately surrounding them in black. The whole lower section of the two marks is in red with white letters. The outside borders of both designs are in gold upon black.<\/p> <p>One of the marks of the defendant is Exhibit D, which is as follows: [See 13 Phil. Rep., page 147.]<\/p> <p>NOTE.\u2014In the original design, the single horse and rider, the back grounds, the lettering and the bolder are in the same colors as those of plaintiffs' Exhibits A and B, with the exception of the words <em>\"Garantiza su bondad\"<\/em> and <em>\"Por eminencia de la ciencia,\"<\/em> surrounding the group of medals, which are in red letters.<\/p> <p>The bottles used by the plaintiffs and the defendant are the same. They are black glass bottles, quadrangular in shape, smaller at the bottom than at the top.<\/p> <p>In the case of the United States <em>vs<\/em>. Manuel (7 Phil. Rep., 221), this court said at page 225:<\/p> <blockquote> <p>\"The true test of unfair competition is whether certain goods have been clothed with an appearance which is likely to deceive the ordinary purchaser exercising ordinary care, and not whether a certain limited class of purchasers with special knowledge not possessed by the ordinary purchaser could avoid mistake by the exercise of this special knowledge.\"<\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>The court below held that Exhibit D, defendant's mark, came within this rule, and was so close an imitation of the plaintiffs' marks, especially Exhibit A, as to deceive the ordinary purchaser.<\/p> <p>Exhibit C, the other mark of the defendant is as follows: [See 13 Phil. Rep., page 148.]<\/p> <p>NOTE.\u2014In the original design the grounds are in black, red and white, with lettering in white, black and red.<\/p> <p>The court held that this was not so close an imitation of the plaintiffs' marks as to deceive the ordinary purchaser. We agree with the view of the court as to both marks. In Liggett &amp; Meyers Tobacco Co. <em>vs<\/em>. Finzer (128 U. S., 182), the court, considering a similar case, said at page 184:<\/p> <blockquote> <p>\"The judgment of the eye upon the two is more satisfactory than evidence from any other source as to the possibility of parties being misled so as to take one tobacco for the other.\"<\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>The principal defense, however, was a claim that the plaintiffs themselves are not entitled to relief by reason of the provisions of section 9 of Act No. 666. That section is as follows:<\/p> <blockquote> <p>\"No action, or suit, or criminal prosecution shall be maintained under the provisions of this Act in any case where the violation of the trade-mark or trade name or the unfair competition complained of has been in any unlawful business, or with respect to any article, trade in which is unlawful, or is against public policy, or in any case where the trade-mark, trade name, or the indicia of origin, ownership, or manufacture have been used by the complaining and injured party for the purpose of himself deceiving the public with respect to the character of the merchandise sold by him or of the business or profession or occupation carried on by him.\"<\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>The defendant proved that the firm of Daniel Visser &amp; Zonen, of Schiedam, had for more than fifteen years used in trade in these Islands a mark of which the marks of the plaintiffs are, he claims, imitations, and he offered in evidence one of these labels which was marked Exhibit 1, and is as follows: [See 13 Phil. Rep., page 150.]<\/p> <p>NOTE.\u2014In the original mark the colors are: Black letters upon a white ground, with the exception of the words <em>\"Calidad Superior,\"<\/em> and <em>\"Schiedam\"<\/em> which are in red letters, and the shield beneath the words <em>\"Unica medalla de oro,\"<\/em> which is in black, white and red, and partly encircling the words <em>\"Ginebra de Holanda\"<\/em> is a heavy red line.<\/p> <p>While the words <em>\"Ginebra Honrada\"<\/em> at the top of Exhibit B are suspiciously similar to the phrase <em>\"Ginebra de Holanda\"<\/em> at the top of Exhibit 1, yet to our minds the existence of any fraud on the part of the plaintiffs is completely rebutted when it is considered that the bottles in which the Schiedam gin is always imported and sold in these Islands are entirely different from the bottles used by the plaintiffs. The Schiedam gin always comes in a long, stone bottle of cylindrical shape. The plaintiffs had never used such a bottle and it would be impossible for any purchaser buying one of the black bottles of the plaintiffs to believe that he was buying Schiedam gin, which never came in any such shape.<\/p> <p>In the case of Ubeda <em>vs<\/em>. Zialcita,<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> No. 4392, decided February 17, 1909, a similar defense was considered and sustained, but in that case it was very clear that the plaintiffs were attempting to pass off their goods as the goods of the importer.<\/p> <p>The court below, while allowing an injunction against the use of Exhibit D, refused to allow the plaintiffs any damages, and they assign that refusal as error. The testimony showed that the defendant commenced to use these marks about July, 1907, and also showed the number of sales by the plaintiffs during each month of that year. According to this showing, the sales in April were 313 cases, in May 255, in June 372, in July 212, in August 204, in September 196, in October 201, in November 185, and in December 215, and the plaintiffs claim that the falling-off in the sales from June was due to the unfair competition of the defendant. The evidence, however, is not sufficient in our opinion to show that this was the cause of the decrease, and this is made more apparent when we consider the proof as to the sales made by the defendant during that same time. There was a decrease from June to July in the plaintiffs' sales of 160 cases, but during the month of July the defendant sold only six cases. There is, therefore, no basis for determining what would have been the reasonable profits which the plaintiffs would have made had the defendant not sold the goods with the trade-mark aforesaid. Section 3 of the Act, however, provides that the plaintiff may recover the profits which the defendant actually made out of the sale of the goods with the trade-mark. While there is proof of the number of cases which the defendant sold during this time, there is no proof as to the profit which the defendant made on each case. There was, therefore, no basis for allowing damages upon that ground.<\/p> <p>The result is that the judgment of the court below is affirmed, without costs to either party.<\/p> <em>Arellano, C.

Urrutia\u00a0 &amp; Co. were not the owners but mere charterers of the <i>Cebu<\/i>, decided the said question in the negative, saying \"that the shipowner or the agent are responsible for the acts of the captain, although the ship be chartered or rented, when the charterers have not, as in the present case, the power to appoint the captain nor to discharge him,\" and therefore absolved the defendants G. Urrutia &amp; Co., with the costs against the plaintiffs.<br\/><br\/>The latter excepted to the judgment and filed a bill of exceptions in this court, and the appeal having been heard, it appears that the appellant files the following assignment of errors:<br\/><blockquote>\"1.\u00a0 The court below erred in finding that the defendants were not responsible for damages caused the plaintiffs, as alleged in the complaint.<br\/><br\/>\"2.\u00a0 The court below erred in deciding the said case in favor of the defendants.\" <\/blockquote> The whole ground of this assignment of errors rests on the proposition advanced by the appellant company that \"the charterer of a vessel, under the conditions stipulated in the charter party in question, is the owner <i>pro hac vice<\/i> of the ship and takes upon himself the responsibilities of the owner.\"<br\/><br\/>Granted that the cause of the damages was the fault, negligence, or incompetence of the captain or the crew of the Cebu and that the damage was caused by the collision of the latter with the <i>Minas de Batan<\/i>, the law applicable to the case, since it occurred in inner waters of Manila Bay, is the Code of Commerce of the Philippines.<br\/><br\/>Article 826 of this code provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"If a vessel should collide with another through the fault, negligence, or lack of skill of the captain, sailing master, or any other member of the complement, the owner of the vessel at fault shall indemnify the loss and damage suffered, after an expert appraisal.\" <\/blockquote> If G. Urrutia &amp; Co., by virtue of the above-mentioned contract, became the agents of the <i>Cebu<\/i>, then they must respond for the damages claimed, because the owner and the agent are civilly responsible for the acts of the captain. (Art. 586.)<br\/><br\/>But G. Urrutia &amp; Co. could not in any way exercise the powers or\u00a0 rights of an agent.\u00a0 They could not represent the ownership of\u00a0 the vessel, nor could they, in their own name and in such capacity, take judicial or extrajudicial steps in all that\u00a0 relates to commerce (art. 595, par. 2); thus if the <i>Cebu<\/i> were attached, they would have no legal capacity to proceed to secure its release; speaking generally, not even the fines could or ought to be paid by them, unless such fines were occasioned by their orders.\u00a0 Article 603 authorizes the agent to discharge at will, before the vessel goes out to sea, the captain and members of the crew in whose contracts a definite period or a definite voyage is not stipulated.\u00a0 And, according to article 597, the agent can choose, and make arrangements with the captain, and make contracts in the name of the owners; the latter will be\u00a0 responsible in the matter of repairs, details of equipment, armament, provisions, fuel, and freight of the vessel, and, in general, in all that relates to the requirements of navigation.\u00a0 And it may have been seen that G. Urrutia &amp; Co. could not do the first-i. e., that which relates to the present question, either appoint the captain or discharge him at any time.<br\/><br\/>The contract executed by Smith, Bell &amp; Co., as agents for the Cebu and G. Urrutia &amp; Co., as charterers of the vessel, did not put the latter in the place of the former, nor make them agents of the owner or owners of the vessel.\u00a0 With relation to those agents, they retained opposing rights derived from the charter party of the vessel, and at no time could they be regarded by the third parties, or by the authorities, or by the courts, as being in the place of the owners or the agents in matters relating to the responsibility pertaining to the ownership and possession of the vessel; neither had they the powers of such owners or agents with respect to the management and navigation of the ship, and still less with regard to the ownership and true possession of the vessel.\u00a0 In proof of this, the ultimate right of an agent, in the\u00a0 matter of his civil liability for indemnities in favor of third persons, arising from the conduct of the captain in the care of freight carried by the vessel, viz:\u00a0 to abandon the vessel with all her equipments together with the proceeds derived from the carriage of freight on the trip, in no manner pertains to G. Urrutia &amp; Co. by virtue of their contract with Smith, Bell &amp; Co.\u00a0 (Art. 587.)<br\/><br\/>The contract simply granted G. Urrutia &amp; Co. the lease of the <i>Cebu<\/i> for the voyages expressed in the sixth clause, namely, from Manila to certain ports, \"and they could not arrange for the vessel to make voyages to other ports not mentioned, without the express authority of Messrs. Smith, Bell &amp; Co.\"\u00a0 Their possession was, therefore, the uncertain title of lease, not a possession representing the true and real possession of the owner, such as is that of the agent, who is fully subrogated to the place of the owner in regard to the dominion, possession, free administration, and navigation of the vessel.<br\/><br\/>G. Urrutia &amp; Co. had only the use of the <i>Cebu<\/i> for the voyages stipulated in the contract, the right to transport their own cargo, and to profits accruing from carriage of extra freight belonging to other persons.<br\/><br\/>The material possession or the possession in fact was held by the captain, and he held it in the name of Messrs. Smith, Bell &amp; Co.; he was their subordinate and represented them in regard to the rights of possession and ownership and to the substance of the vessel, the preservation and management of which were entrusted to his care and vigilance without contemplation of any right in favor of other persons to whom the use and enjoyment of the ship might have been granted.\u00a0 Only in\u00a0 regard to this use and enjoyment was he placed under the orders of the lessees within the terms and limits of the contract.<br\/><br\/>The responsibility involved in the present action is that derived from the management of the vessel, which was defective on account of lack of skill, negligence, or fault, either of the captain or of the crew, for which the captain is responsible to the agent, who in his turn is responsible to the third party prejudiced or damaged.\u00a0 (Art. 618, Code of Commerce.)<br\/><br\/>The rule of law laid down by the lower court is the same international rule adopted by the Congress of Antwerp, and it is a logical corollary of the precise provisions of the Code of Commerce now in force.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, we affirm the judgment appealed from, with the costs of this instance against the appellant\u00a0 company.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa, Carson<\/i>, and <i>Willard, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><\/div>",

Lim Co<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> (No. 4838), just decided, we quoted at length all the pertinent provisions of the Act of Congress of April 29, 1902, and\u00a0 of the Act of the Commission Numbered 702, which are applicable to the facts proven in this case; they are therefore omitted from this opinion to avoid unnecessary\u00a0 repetition.<br\/><br\/>It will be seen that under the provisions of section 5 of Act No. 702, every Chinese person found without the prescribed certificate\u00a0 after the expiration of the time limited by law\u00a0 for registration, is presumed, in the absence of satisfactory proof to the contrary,\u00a0 to be a Chinese laborer, and is subject to deportation, as provided in the Act; in other words, in proceedings looking to the deportation of Chinese persons under the provisions of this section, the burden of proof rests upon the defendant to show that he is not a Chinese laborer.<br\/><br\/>Similar provisions in the Chinese Exclusion Act of May 5, 1892 (27\u00a0 Stat. at L., 25), have been held valid.\u00a0 (Low Foon Yin <i>vs<\/i>. U. S. Commissioner of Immigration, 145 Fed. Rep., 791; see also U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Lung Hong, 105 Fed. Rep., 188; U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Sing Lee, 125 Fed. Rep.,\u00a0 627; U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Yee Gee You, 152 Fed.\u00a0 Rep., 157-159.)\u00a0 And it has been held that proceedings brought under the Chinese Exclusion Act for the deportation of a Chinese person are civil and not criminal (In re Lam Jung Sing, 150 Fed. Rep., 608); and that the facts constituting the defense in such cases are peculiarly within the knowledge of the party charged, and the burden of proof is naturally placed upon him.\u00a0 (In re Sing Lee and In re Ching Jo, 54 Fed. Rep., 334.)\u00a0 Reference to these cases appears to furnish a sufficient answer to contentions based upon the constitutionality of the provisions of the Act in this regard.<br\/><br\/>Defendant and appellee does not deny that he is a Chinese person or that he was found, as alleged in the complaint, in the city of Manila, on the 23d day of January, 1908, without the certificate prescribed in the above-cited provisions of law for persons of his race and citizenship; but he denies that he is a Chinese laborer, alleging that he is a merchant and that he is now and has been ever since the passage of the Act lawfully in the Philippine Islands, but that he was unable, by reason of sickness and other unavoidable causes, to procure a certificate within the time prescribed by law.<br\/><br\/>The evidence introduced at the trial in support of defendant's allegations consists of the testimony of the defendant himself, and of the witnesses Chua Chui, Vicente Upo Enriquez, and Andres Setente.<br\/><br\/>Defendant swore that he was the owner of a cigar store and a <i>sari-sari<\/i> store, both situated at No. 204 Calle Aceiteros, in the city of Manila; that these stores were conducted in the name of Chua Ohui; that they were not conducted in his own name, because that is the practice with many Chinese, and because one Chinaman has to stay in the store while the other goes to the provinces to sell goods; that he sells at wholesale and retail; that he values the store at P4,000; that one-half of-the business belongs to Chua Chui and one-half to himself; that the license under which they do business is in the name of Chua Chui; that he has debts due and owing to the amount of about P500; that he was born at Amoy, China, and is 37 years of age; that he has been in the Philippine Islands since the year 1889; that after his\u00a0 arrival he went first to the Divisoria Market, but had no business\u00a0 there, as he was only waiting for a steamer; that he stayed there about six months, and then went to Marinduque, where he lived for six years and a half with his father who had a store there; that about six years ago he went to Calauan, Laguna, where he stayed about six months;\u00a0 that during the time of the registration of Chinese in the Islands he was in the hospital suffering from a bullet wound with which he was laid\u00a0 up for twenty-two months; that he was prevented from getting his registration certificate on account of his wound, and that when he recovered in 1905 \"they were not issuing any more certificates;\" that before he was wounded \"they did not have any certificates;\" that he has no certificate of registration and no cedula for this year because, since he has no certificate, he can not obtain a cedula.<br\/><br\/>Chua Chui, a Chinese witness, testified that he lives at No. 204 Calle Aceiteros, where he has a<i> tienda<\/i> in which he sells tobacco, cigarettes, and <i>sari-sari<\/i>; that Sy Quiat, the defendant, is his partner, and that they sell at wholesale and sometimes at retail; that the value of the business is about P4,000; that he keeps a set of Chinese books; that \"it is mentioned in the books, the partnership of two men Sy Quiat and the witness; that if required he could bring the books into court; that the store is in the name of the witness (Chua Chui), and is conducted in his name, and that the license for the store is in his name; that he has a cedula as a merchant and has a merchant's certificate.<br\/><br\/>Vicente Upo Enriquez, a native witness for the defendant, testified that he is a <i>practicante<\/i> (unlicensed physician) and has known Sy Quiat since December, 1903; that he assisted him for a month until he was entirely recovered, after leaving the hospital and coming to Manila; that Sy Quiat has a <i>tienda<\/i> at No. 204 Calle Aceiteros; that it is worth P4,000; that he sells canned goods, matches, paper, onions, and various kinds of Chinese foods; that they sell cigars and tobacco but in a separate store from the <i>sari-sari<\/i> store, although the stores have the same door; that he has seen Sy Quiat acting as representative\u00a0 looking after the store; that lie does not know whether Sy Quiat is a partner or an employee of the store.<br\/><br\/>Andres Setente, also a native Avitness, testified that he lives at Calle Ylaya\u00a0 and sells firewood, which he brings from Mariveles and peddles around the streets to the Chinese; that he has known Sy Quiat since 1896, when the witness belonged to\u00a0 the police force; that at that time Sy Quiat had a <i>tienda<\/i> at Santo Cristo; that he now has a <i>tienda<\/i> where he sells tobacco, cigarettes, and <i>sari-sari<\/i>; that he asked the defendant if he had a store, and that he told him that he had a partner who is a merchant and has a merchant's certificate.<br\/><br\/>We do not think that this evidence constitutes \"satisfactory proof7 of the fact that the defendant is a \"merchant\" in the sense in which that term is employed in Act No. 702.\u00a0 Section 12 of that Act, which is taken from section 2 of the Act of Congress of 1893,\u00a0 amending the Act of May 5,1892, entitled \"An Act to prohibit the coming of Chinese into the United States,\" provides as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"The word 'laborer' or 'laborers' wherever used in this Act shall be construed to mean both skilled and unskilled manual laborers, including Chinese laundry men and Chinese employed in mining, fishing, huckstering, peddling, or taking, drying, or otherwise preserving shell or other fish for home consumption or exportation.<br\/><br\/>\"The term 'merchant' as employed in this Act signifies a person engaged in buying and selling merchandise at a fixed place of business, <i>which business is conducted in his name,<\/i> and who during the time he claims to be engaged as a merchant does not engage in the performance of any manual labor except such as is necessary in the conduct of his business as such merchant.\u00a0 The definition of 'laborer' and 'merchant' set out in this section shall receive the same construction as that given to it by the Federal courts of the United States and the rulings and regulations of the Treasury Department of the United States.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>We think that the finding of the trial court that \"the defendant is now and has been for some years last past a joint owner with his partner in a store located on Calle Aceiteros, in the city of Manila\" is not satisfactorily proven by the testimony of record, and that there is no competent or admissible evidence in the record in support of the finding that \"the partnership papers are in the name of Chua Chui and Sy Quiat.\"<br\/><br\/>The evidence with which the defendant undertook to establish his allegation that he has a half interest in the store on Calle Aceiteros is wholly unconvincing and unsatisfactory.\u00a0 It is difficult to believe that in proceedings in the Court of First Instance of Manila, looking to his deportation from the Islands, the defendant, if he were in (ruth, the owner of a half interest in a store worth P4,000, situated in the city of Manila, could not and would not have offered more satisfactory proof of this fact, for it would appear that the strongest and most convincing evidence in support of such a claim must have been easily available if it had been true.\u00a0 No evidence of any kind appears in the record save only the verbal declaration of the defendant himself and that of his alleged partner.\u00a0 The testimony of Andres Setente, a street peddler of firewood, upon such a question in relation to one of his clients may be wholly disregarded.\u00a0 The only evidence in support of the finding that the partnership papers are in the name of Chua Chui and Sy Quiat was the testimony of the witness Chua Ohui, who stated that \"it is mentioned in the books, the partnership of two men,\" Sy Quiat and the witness.\u00a0 But this testimony was clearly incompetent on the ground that the books themselves were the best evidence as to their contents, and should not have been admitted over the objection of counsel for the United States, which was interposed in due time.\u00a0 We think that the court undoubtedly erred in admitting this testimony and in refusing to accede to the motion of counsel for plaintiff to compel defendant to bring the books into court.\u00a0 The burden of proof resting upon the defendant, it was his duty to offer the books in evidence, if he conceived that they were or could sustain any of his material allegations, and his failure so to do, after plaintiff called for their production, justifies the presumption that, if introduced in evidence, they would not have tended to sustain his allegations.<br\/><br\/>But even were it possible to regard these findings as satisfactorily proven by the testimony of record, such findings and the evidence on which they rest are clearly insufficient to sustain the ultimate conclusion of fact by the trial court that Sy Quiat is a \"merchant\" and not a \"Chinese laborer,\" in the sense in which those words are used in the Act.\u00a0 Both the defendant and his alleged partner testified that the stores at No. 204 Calle Aceiteros were\u00a0 conducted in the name of Chua Chui, and not in the name of the defendant, and that the license therefor was also in the name of Chua Chui.\u00a0 The term \"merchant,\" as defined in the Act, is limited to a person engaged in buying and selling merchandise at a fixed place of business, <i>which business is conducted in his name<\/i>, and the defendant having wholly failed to prove that he is engaged in buying and selling merchandise at a fixed place of business, which business is conducted in his name, must be presumed under section 5 to be a Chinese laborer, and subject to deportation as provided in section 4, since it is not denied that he is a Chinese person found without the prescribed certificate within the Philippine Islands after the expiration of the time limited by law for registration.<br\/><br\/>We are satisfied that the meaning which we have given to the words \"Chinese laborer\" and \"Chinese merchant\" as used in the Act of the Commission is in conformity with the express provisions of the Act itself; and it will be found that a similar meaning has been given these words as used in the Chinese Exclusion Acts of the Congress of the United States by the Federal courts of the United States and the rulings and regulations of the Treasury Department, which,\u00a0 by the express provisions of section 12 of the Act, are made authoritative guides as to the definition which should be given these terms in this jurisdiction.<br\/><br\/>In the case of the\u00a0 U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Chung Ki Foon (83 Fed. Rep., 143, 144), it was held that \"Chinese laborers,\" as used in the Act of November 3, 1803 (c. 14, sec. 1, 28 Stat. 7, U. S. Comp. St., 1901, p. 1322), relating to certificates of residence, \"refer not only to those actually engaged in manual labor at the date of the passage of that Act, but were intended to include all Chinese persons dependent upon their manual labor as a means of securing an honest livelihood and self-support, <i>and those who are not 'officers, teachers, students, merchants, or travelers for curiosity,'<\/i> within the meaning of the treaty of November 17, 1880, between the United States and China.\"<br\/><br\/>In the case of U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Pin Kwan (100 Fed. Rep., 609) it was held that proof \"that a Chinese person, since he came to the United States, has been assisting in the business of a mercantile company, keeping the books and selling the goods, and that lie has an interest in the stock of goods of such company, is insufficient to establish his status as a merchant within the statute.\"<br\/><br\/>In the case of U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Chung Ki Foon (83 Fed. Rep., 143, 144) it was held that \"the words, 'Chinese laborers,' in the Act of November 3, 1893 (28 Stat. 7, sec. 1), amending the Act of May 5,\u00a0 1892 (27 Stat.\u00a0 25, sec. 6), and relating to certificates of residence, included a Chinaman engaged in the business of keeping a restaurant and lodging house, and all Chinese persons dependent upon their labor for support whether actually employed as laborers or not.\"<br\/><br\/>In the case of the U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Quan Gin (61 Fed. Rep., 395) it was held that under the statute not only must the business be conducted in the Chinese person's own name, but that a Chinese person seeking admission upon the ground that he was a returning merchant must be excluded where it appears that the business was conducted under a firm name of which his own name was no part.\u00a0 In that case there was evidence that the defendant was a partner and that Chinese persons do not in general conduct business in individual or partnership names, but the court said (p. 397):<br\/><blockquote>\"It is contended, in opposition to this view of the law, that such an interpretation will exclude nearly every Chinese merchant seeking to enter the United States, since, as before stated, it is claimed that Chinese merchants do not, as a rule, conduct their business affairs in individual or partnership names.\u00a0 This may be so, but if it is so, it is a consideration to be addressed to the lawmaking power and not to the court\"<br\/><\/blockquote>And referring to an opinion of the Attorney-General of the United States, dated April 6,\u00a0 1904, the court further said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The Attorney-General gives a most convincing reason for his interpretation of the statute.\u00a0 He says:<br\/><br\/>\"'This requirement that a merchant must conduct a business in his own name can have but one purpose, to wit, that he who is a merchant in fact shall also be known to be such by the parties with whom he deals and by the public generally.\u00a0 That purpose could readily be defeated if it were possible to conceal his identity by trading under an assumed name, or under the disguise of a \"Co.\"'<br\/><br\/>\"When it is considered how easy it is for a Chinese person seeking admission into the United States to claim a small interest in the business of buying and selling merchandise, it is evident that the statute has been wisely framed to prevent the admission of Chinese\u00a0 persons into the United States upon the fictitious and fraudulent claim that they are merchants.\u00a0 In my opinion, therefore, when an application is made by a Chinaman for entrance into the United States on the ground that he was formerly engaged in business in this country as a merchant, he must, before being admitted, establish by the testimony of two credible witnesses, other than Chinese, among other things, that he conducted the business in which he was engaged, either in his own name, or in a firm name of which his own is a part.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The Department of Commerce and Labor of the United States (to which by act of Congress the final decision of administrative appeals from rulings of immigration officers has been transferred from the Treasury Department) ruled on May 18, 1904, as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Another and more important reason exists, however, for the denial of the appellant, to wit:\u00a0 According to his own sworn statement, the Canton firm in which he claims membership is engaged in the manufacture of 'black-wood furniture,' a circumstance which removes him from the mercantile class as contemplated by the Chinese Exclusion Law.\u00a0 Upon this point see Department\u00a0 decision of December 7, 1903 (No. 10723-C), and December 14, 1903 (No. 9774-C), in the last mentioned of which the following passage is quoted from the decision rendered February 18, 1895, in the Lai Moy case, by the United States Circuit Court of Appeals, ninth circuit (66 F. R. 955) :<br\/><br\/><i>\"'The designation \"merchant\" does not include, comprehensively, all who are not laborers, but strictly \"a person (to quote the Act) engaged in buying and selling merchandise.\"<\/i>\u00a0 To fabricate merchandise as appellant did, is not to buy and sell it.\u00a0 Nor may both be done, for the \"merchant\" may not (again to quote the Act) \"engage in the performance of any manual labor except such as is necessary in the conduct of his business as such merchant;\" that is, in buying and selling merchandise; and the manual labor which is precluded is skilled as well as unskilled.'\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It appearing that the defendant is not a \"merchant\" within the meaning of that term as used in the Act, and that he is a Chinese laborer, and that he has neglected, failed, or refused to register under the provision of the Act of Congress of April 29, 1902, and the provisions and regulations enacted pursuant thereto by the Philippine Commission in Act No. 702, it was the duty of the trial court to order his deportation from the Philippine Islands, and the judgment of that court discharging him from custody is, therefore, reversed without costs in this instance.<br\/><br\/>In twenty days judgment will be entered reversing the judgment of the trial court and ten days thereafter the record will be returned to the court wherein it originated, where judgment will be\u00a0 entered in conformity herewith.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

we went to see Guiled and I asked him to help us in the search.\u00a0 He detailed Palos, a friend of mine, to help us, and we continued to follow the tracks of the horse.\u00a0 In the company of Palos, we endeavored to find the horse and followed its tracks, and, after a while, we found the animal tied near the house of Guiled; we then untied it, this being done by Palos, who also took the horse away; from there we led the horse to the house of Guiled and requested him to furnish us with a certificate showing that the animal was found at his place.\u00a0 He replied: 'How can I furnish you with the certificate?\u00a0 No one here knows how to write.\u00a0 As it was growing late, I begged Guiled to allow us to remain in his house, to which he assented, whereupon some of us started to prepare our meal, while one of our companions repaired to the east side of Guiled's house to obtain some bark which they needed; after a while our said companion returned and told us that there were three pigs in a pen.\u00a0 We went to the place where the pigs were and I recognized one of them as being my own and the other two as the property of <i>Capitan<\/i> Bayasang and Sabong, respectively.\u00a0 Having made this discovery I went to Guiled arid asked him from whom he obtained the animals and he replied that he had acquired them from one Martin.\u00a0 After hearing his reply, I notified him that one of the pigs belonged to me and that the others were the property of <i>Capitan<\/i> Bayasang and Sabong, respectively, and asked him to allow me to take the animals to my house.\u00a0 To this he assented, and said, moreover, that he would come along with us to the town in order to see Martin and recover from him the money he had paid for the pigs, and besides that he had also to collect P9 that Martin owed him.\u00a0 After this conversation, it being almost dark, we prepared our supper there, ate, and spent the night in the house of Guiled.\u00a0 The following day, Friday, we took breakfast there and also our noon meal in said house, and then started for Pugo shortly after midday, and in the company of Osteng and Guiled we went to the office of the president.\" <\/blockquote> The witness further testified:\u00a0 That the twelve individuals who came from Pugo, besides Osteng, Palos, and Guiled, with their respective wives, one Capitan Saliuag whom they found already in the house and the children thereof, slept in the house of Guiled; that they arrived at Pugo on Friday afternoon; that they met Martin in the office of the president, where he had gone; that he (the witness) overheard the witness saying to Martin:\u00a0 \"Inasmuch as you are not the owner of the pigs you sold me, you must return the money to me,\" and Martin who replied:\u00a0 \"All right, but I have no money now, I will pay you as soon as I get it;\" that Guiled had told them that he had paid 6 pesos for the three hogs and that Guiled had passed the night of Friday at Pugo, in the house of <i>Capitan<\/i> Guideng, taking his supper at the house of <i>Capitan<\/i> Licao and his breakfast on Saturday morning at the house of the witness, after which he (Guiled) returned to his house.<br\/><br\/>The judgment reads, and it is true, that:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"There is no dispute or controversy as regards the fact that the defendants had been in the house of Guiled, nor as to the taking of the three pigs by them; and, if these animals were taken away under the circumstances alleged by the\u00a0 defendants, they have committed no crime.\u00a0 The testimony of the principal witnesses is absolutely contradictory and can not be reconciled; either the witnesses for the prosecution or those for the defense have testified falsely.\" <\/blockquote> Guiled and Cimbay, his wife, Palos, and Osteng are the witnesses for the prosecution, as to the affair which, they say, took place in the house of Guiled.<br\/><br\/>Anaban, the president of the settlement or pueblo of Pugo, and the other eleven persons who composed the party which went out in search of two horses they had lost, have consistently given a long detailed account of their two days' trip, of their stay in the house of Guiled as guests of the latter, and to whom belonged the rice they cooked on that night, and who even gave them the meal on Friday which was brought by four members of his settlement who returned to Pugo with the other twelve on Friday afternoon.\u00a0 Guiled accompanied them and remained at Pugo during that night until Saturday morning, when he left.\u00a0 This was testified to with rare unanimity by sixteen witnesses, with the exception of slight discrepancies as regards the stay of Guiled at Pugo from Friday afternoon to Saturday morning.<br\/><br\/>There is one very important point in the case.\u00a0 Lateng sent Licao, an Igorot, to Baguicr to give information as to what had happened in the house of Guiled.\u00a0 Licao testified that he was sent by Lateng, Cimbay, and Ogues.\u00a0 Licao left Taloy on Friday morning and reached Baguio in the afternoon.\u00a0 The Attorney-General says in his brief:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"On arriving at Baguio in the afternoon, Licao proceeded at once to the <i>tribunal<\/i> to give the above said information.\u00a0 Naturally, Licao knew nothing more of what had occurred in the house of Guiled than what he had been told by Gimbay and Ogues, each one of whom ran out for help as soon as they saw Guiled tied up, so that, when Licao arrived at Baguio, he could do nothing but notify, as he did, the municipal secretary, Santiago Sales, that something unusual was taking place in the house of Guiled, whereupon Sales wrote and handed to Licao the following letter:<br\/><br\/>\" 'Baguio, October 6, 1906.-Dear Belet, councilor of Taloy, Benguet.-With reference to the information given me by the person you have sent over here, regarding the presence of certain strangers in that locality, you may forward them to this office, whatever purpose they have or things they are looking for, especially if they come from other provinces and are unknown to you-(Sgd.) Santiago Sales, municipal secretary.'\u00a0 (Exhibit A.)<br\/><br\/>\"Although this letter-the Attorney-General continues-is dated October 6, it must have been written oh Friday the 5th of October,\u00a0 on which date Licao says he arrived at Baguio, received the letter and went back to Taloy, though he only got as far as Atab.\u00a0 Santiago Sales himself is very certain that he sent the letter on the day previous to the arrival of Guiled at Baguio, and we find no inconsistency in the testimony as regards the fact that Guiled reached Baguio on the afternoon of Saturday the 6th of October.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Brief, p. 8,) <\/blockquote> This letter written by Sales, which must have been in the possession of Guiled or someone of the barrio of Taloy, was found at Pugo and produced by the defense during the trial.\u00a0 How this happened has not been explained at the trial.<br\/><br\/>Licao testified that he left Baguio on Friday night, spent the night at Atab, and then proceeded to Pugo, in compliance with the instructions he received from Sales.\u00a0 To judge by the inconsistencies found in his answers, while testifying during the taking of the evidence in rebuttal, this witness must have been greatly harassed.\u00a0 It appears that his testimony was controlled by the dominant idea that he did not go farther than Atab, in which place, it first appears he slept twice, but later he says he remained there only once, on Friday night; it must have been another controlling idea in his testimony that he did not reach Pugo until Sunday, and that he slept in his house on Saturday night, not taking into account the serious happening at the house of his councilor and not taking any pains in delivering at once the, letter to Guiled.\u00a0 The following questions were propounded by the court:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"Q.\u00a0 Did you meet any of your acquaintances while traveling from Atab to your home?-A. Yes, I met Guiled.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 Was there anybody with him ?-A. He was alone, I wanted to give him the letter, but he told me to take it to Pugo.\" <\/blockquote> <br\/>The defense put the following questions:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"Q.\u00a0 What orders did you receive from the secretary when he gaye you the letter?-A.\u00a0 He said\u00a0 nothing.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 Did the municipal secretary tell you to hand the letter to Guiled?-A.\u00a0 Yes.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 Did you give the letter to Guiled?-A. No, because he told me that he could not read.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 You delivered the letter to Guiled, did you not?-A.\u00a0 Yes, I did, but on seeing it, he told me to take\u00a0 it to Pugo because he could not read.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 Where did you meet Guiled?-A.\u00a0 Between Baguio and Taloy.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 When you went to Pugo, did you see Guiled there?-A. No.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 Where was he when you were at Pugo?-A.\u00a0 He must have been here (in Baguio) on Saturday the 6th because I met him on the road, on his way to this place.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 Is it not true that you went to Pugo because they told you in Taloy that Guiled was there?-A.\u00a0 No; I went there on account of the letter.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 When you met Guiled, did you tell him that the letter was for him?-A.\u00a0 No.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 Did not the municipal secretary of Baguio tell you to deliver the letter to Guiled?-A.\u00a0 Yes, he told me to hand it to Guiled, and for this reason I handed it to him when I met him, but he told\u00a0 me to take it to Pugo because he could not read.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 Did you tell Guiled that the municipal secretary had' instructed you to deliver the letter to him?-A.\u00a0 Yes, I told him, but he could not read and I took the letter to Pugo.\"\u00a0 (Pp. 466 to 468.) <\/blockquote> <br\/>The letter and the testimony of this witness throw much light on the two versions which appear from the records in regard to the facts which really happened in Selpang and Pugo, on Thursday and Friday, the 4th and the 5th of October, 1906.<br\/><br\/>If the defendants\u00a0 are really guilty, if they have committed the crime of robbery <i>en cuadrilla<\/i>, with the aggravating circumstance of nocturnity being present, they should be sentenced to the penalty of <i>presidio mayor<\/i> in its maximum degree, and the chief of the band, Anaban, to the penalty next higher.\u00a0 Anaban, however, was sentenced to two years' imprisonment, and the others to six months and one day.<br\/><br\/>The letter shows that the defendants went to Selpang for the purpose of looking for something, not to steal, and this is what was communicated to the secretary.\u00a0 It is unnatural and improbable that Guiled, after having been abused by the people from Pugo, should have sent to them the very letter which is the reply to the complaint he made against them.\u00a0 Guiled must have been really present at Pugo on Saturday; he must have received Sales' letter there, and from thence he must have left for Baguio, perhaps for fear of being complained of.\u00a0 On arrival at Baguio, and if he had made any complaint of that abuse and robbery <i>en cuadrilla<\/i> with, arms, the municipality would have necessarily referred him to the court of the justice of the peace for the preliminary investigation.\u00a0 Said proceeding could not have lasted until the 18th of October.<br\/><br\/>The justice of the peace stated that he remembered that the defendants testified that they had gone to Selpang to look for some horses, and the testimony of Anaban during the preliminary investigation having been produced by the defense, it appears in every way consistent with the testimony which, in regard to their trip to Selpang, he and his companions have so uniformly given.\u00a0 The innocence of the defendants is evident.<br\/><br\/>We, therefore, reverse the judgment appealed from in all its parts and acquit the defendants with the costs of both instances <i>de oficio.<\/i><br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa, Carson<\/i>, and <i>Willard, JJ<\/i>., concur. <\/div>",

Juan Te Chico et al., the plaintiff is the manager above-mentioned, and he brought the action to recover a balance claimed to be due him for his services and profits to which he was entitled.<br\/><br\/>The theory of the defendants Juan Te Chico and Cu Ung Jeng is that these claims are all fictitious and that they are the result of a conspiracy between the plaintiffs in the respective actions and Te Quim Jua for the purpose of defrauding the defendant company.\u00a0 In the present case the partner who actually delivered the money represented by the promissory notes was, according to the testimony of the plaintiff Ang Bang Ca the other plaintiff Ang Quian Cieg.\u00a0 It is a suspicious circumstance that about six weeks before the trial he departed from the Islands for China, leaving here his notes and the book of the plaintiff company which showed the payment of the money.\u00a0 His partner, however, testified that the amount represented by the promissory notes had actually gone out of the business and had been paid to Te Quim Jua.\u00a0 Te Quim Jua testified that he received the money and used it in the business of the defendant company.<br\/><br\/>The witnesses for the plaintiff in this action and the witnesses for the plaintiff in the case of Margarita Mendoza, all testified that these notes were made at different times and at their respective dates.\u00a0 The witness Claro Reyes testified that he made them all upon a typewriter upon Catalan paper, which he had in his office.\u00a0 The defendants insist that it appears conclusively from the internal evidence offered by the notes themselves that they were not made at different times and upon their respective dates, but that, on the contrary, all of the notes in this case were made at one time and all of the notes in the Margarita Mendoza case were made at another distinct time.\u00a0 This internal evidence consists in the first place in the appearance of the typewritten letters on the notes, it being claimed that in the Margarita Mendoza notes the same letters are blurred in each one of them, although they were made, some of them, months after others.\u00a0 In all the notes in this case the same letters present the blurred appearance, but the blurred letters in the notes in this case are not the letters which are blurred in the notes in the Margarita Mendoza case.\u00a0 To illustrate:\u00a0 Exhibit B in the latter case, purporting to have been made on the 24th of April, 1905, and Exhibit D, purporting to have been made on the 24th of July, 1905, present the same blurred letters, while Exhibit E in the present case, purporting to have been made on the \"21st of April, three days before Exhibit B in the Mendoza case presents a different set of blurred letters.\u00a0 The other internal evidence consists in the fact claimed to exist by the defendants that the little indentations caused by the tearing of the paper fit perfectly.\u00a0 And in Exhibits C and B in the present case the parts of the watermark conform exactly, showing, as is claimed, that the two pieces originally formed a part of the same sheet of Catalan paper.\u00a0 These two notes are dated nearly a month and a half apart.<br\/><br\/>In addition to this internal evidence the defendants proved, we think, that Te Quim Jua, the manager of the defendant company during the time covered by the notes in this case acted for the plaintiff firm, whether in the capacity of an employee or of a partner does not appear, but it is proved that he received money in payment of goods sold by them and signed receipts for the payment of such money.\u00a0 He denied that he ever acted in any such capacity.\u00a0 The evidence satisfies us that he did not tell the truth in this respect and the other evidence indicates that other witnesses who testified in behalf of the plaintiffs did not state some of the facts as they existed.<br\/><br\/>But notwithstanding all of this evidence, and notwithstanding the fact that these defendants may not have testified truly in regard to the time when the notes were made, yet, if, in fact, the plaintiffs in these two cases really paid the money represented by these notes to Te Quim Jua and he used it in the business of the defendant company, the latter should be made to repay the money.<br\/><br\/>Juan Te Chico was the general manager of the company, living in Iloilo, where was located the main office of the company.\u00a0 Te Quim Jua was the manager of the Manila branch and had authority to buy goods in the name of the firm and to borrow money in its name.\u00a0 The business of the concern was the purchase of <i>sinamay<\/i> in Iloilo and its shipment to Manila for sale, and the purchase of <i>jusi<\/i> and other merchandise in Manila and its shipment to Iloilo.\u00a0 Juan Te Chico, the manager, left the Islands for China some time in the early part of the year 1905, January or February, and returned to Iloilo some time in May or June and thereafter came to Manila some time in June or July.\u00a0 It will be seen that he was absent during the time when some of these notes purport to have been given.\u00a0 His representative in Iloilo during his absence was Ong Bong Po, who had full authority to act for him during his absence and who, as testified to by Juan Te Chico himself, had all the powers that he had in the management of the business.<br\/><br\/>Juan Te Chico testified that when he was in Iloilo he was in the habit of making drafts upon the Manila branch, which the latter accepted and paid.\u00a0 During his absence in China Ong Bong Po drew drafts repeatedly, for large amounts, on the Manila branch.\u00a0 These drafts, according to the testimony of Te Quim Jua, were accepted by him and afterwards paid by him, and he presented at the trial thirty-four such documents, stating that he had paid during the year 1905 more than P40,000 upon drafts drawn upon the Manila branch by the Iloilo house.\u00a0 The fact that these drafts were drawn by Ong Bong Po is proven by certain letters in which he states that he has been compelled to draw them and urges Te Quim Jua to accept them and pay them, directing him to borrow money if necessary and occasionally telling him that within a few days he would remit money to him.\u00a0 It appears from these letters also that the value of the material sent to Manila was inconsiderable when compared with the amount of the drafts drawn by the Iloilo house. It moreover appears that the Manila branch had no capital set aside for the transaction of its business and that during the time in question Te Quim Jua, as the manager, bought <i>jusi<\/i> and other material, which he sent to Iloilo.\u00a0 The purchase of this merchandise and the payment of the drafts above mentioned required a large amount of money.<br\/><br\/>No evidence was introduced by the defendants to contradict this proof.\u00a0 They made no attempt to show that drafts were not drawn to the amount claimed by Te Quim Jua, nor any evidence to show that he had not paid them.<br\/><br\/>There is an additional circumstance, moreover, of importance in the case. The notes are, almost all of them, drawn in the following form, to wit: \" Know all men by these presents that I, Trinidad Jurado Te Quim Jua, as attorney in fact of Juan Te Chico, manager of the firm of Sam Jap Jim &amp; Co., of the Iloilo branch in Manila, established at' 149 Calle Nueva, Manila, P. I., hereby set forth that, my principal having drawn drafts Nos. 125, 126, and 128 in Iloilo for the sum of Pl,296 for acceptance and payment by this firm under my management though it be necessary to borrow money for the purpose, I find myself obliged to borrow money from Jua Qui, represented by Ang Quinsec, by virtue of the powers conferred in me, my principal and the firm I represent obligating themselves to pay within six months from the date of the execution of this document of indebtedness.<br\/><blockquote>\"In testimony whereof I subscribe this and affix the seal of the house I represent this 29th day of April, 1905. <br\/>\"[SEAL.] \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (Signed)\u00a0 TRINIDAD J. TE QUIM JUA.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It will be seen that these notes specified by numbers the drafts to pay which the money was borrowed.\u00a0 If no such drafts were drawn, it would have been an easy matter apparently for the defendants to have proven that fact.<br\/><br\/>More than P40,000 was paid out, therefore, by the Manila house; to meet these payments it was necessary to borrow money.\u00a0 This appears not only from the letters written by Ong Bong Po but also from those written by Te Quim Jua in answer thereto.\u00a0 The amount as appears from these two suits was about P20,000.\u00a0 It having been necessary to borrow money, and money having been actually borrowed, the court below was evidently of the opinion that the evidence in the case was sufficient to show that the plaintiffs in these two cases were the ones who loaned it.\u00a0 With this opinion we agree.\u00a0 There are other facts which strengthen this conclusion. Juan Te Chico himself was here in Manila during part of June and all of the month of July, 1905; he lived in the same house with Te Quim Jua; nearly P8,000 was borrowed while he was here and actually engaged in the business of the firm.\u00a0 Te Quim Jua testified that he informed Juan Te Chico of these loans; there was testimony of other witnesses to the effect that the last two loans were made from Margarita Mendoza, upon the express orders of Juan Te Chico and that when the money produced by the loan was brought to the store Juan Te Chico himself helped to count it.<br\/><br\/>The notes are all in Spanish.\u00a0 The plaintiff who testified in this case could not read Spanish.\u00a0 Margarita Mendoza could neither read nor write, and when they testified that these particular exhibits were delivered upon their respective dates they could not really know whether these identical documents were the ones which they then received.\u00a0 It is possible that as the money was advanced by the plaintiffs from time to time some memorandum thereof was given, and when all the transactions were completed these memoranda were surrendered and the notes now in question were given in their place.\u00a0 But however that may be, we do not think the fact that these notes were all written at the same time is sufficient to overcome the testimony to which we have above referred.<br\/><br\/>The only defendants who appealed are Juan Te Chico and Cu Ung Jeng.\u00a0 In the case of Ang Seng Quen and others against Juan Te Chico, No. 4765, just decided, we have discussed the liability of the two appellants for the debts of the partnership, and what is there said is applicable to this case.<br\/><br\/>The judgment, so far as it relates to Juan Te Chico, is affirmed, with the costs of this instance against him; so far as it relates to Cu Ung Jeng it is reversed, and he is acquitted of the complaint, with the costs of first instance against the plaintiffs.\u00a0 No costs will be allowed to Cu Ung Jeng in this court.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

That the court erred in holding that the merchandise, sold by appellee to exporters in the Philippine Islands and bought by such exporters for the purpose and with the intention of exporting the same, was not sold 'for domestic consumption' in the Philippine Islands, within the meaning of section 139 of Act No. 1189 of the Philippine Commission; and that the taxes imposed were not authorized by law;<br\/><br\/>\"2. That the court erred in holding that the purchase of merchandise by appellee for others and shipping the same to them, for which services so performed appellee charged and received a specific amount, did not make said appellee a merchant under the provisions of section 140 of the aforesaid Act No. 1189, and that the tax imposed and collected was not properly leviable;<br\/><br\/>\"3. That the court erred in giving judgment in favor of appellee and against appellant;<br\/><br\/>\"4. That the court erred in refusing the motion of appellant to set aside its aforesaid judgment and grant a new trial on the ground that said judgment was contrary to law, and that the evidence was insufficient to justify the decision.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In support of his assignment, appellant lays down the following propositions? which, if their soundness be admitted, clearly entitle him to a reversal of the judgment of the trial court, and to a judgment that the plaintiff recover nothing under his complaint:<br\/><blockquote>\"1. The taxes imposed under sections 139 and 140 of Act No. 1189 are occupation taxes and are not imposed upon goods, wares, and merchandise <i>per se<\/i>, sold, bartered, or exchanged.<br\/><br\/>\"2. All goods, wares, and merchandise sold by any person in the Philippine Islands on his own account or on commission for another to any other person in the Philippine Islands, whether such other person be an exporter or not, and whether such goods, wares, and merchandise so sold be or be not subsequently exported by the purchaser, is a sale of such goods wares, and merchandise 'for domestic consumption7 in the Philippine Islands within the meaning of section 139 of Act No. 1189; and every such person making such sale is a merchant within the terms of section 140 of said Act and is subject to the taxes imposed by section 139 unless such person is within the exempted classes enumerated in section 142 of said Act.<br\/><br\/>\"3. The alleged purchases by appellee on commission for growers and producers of hemp, etc., were in effect, sales to such purchasers.<br\/><\/blockquote>The provisions of sections 139, 140, and 142 of Act No. 1189, upon which appellant bases his right to make the collections in question, are as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"SEC. 139.\u00a0 Except as hereinafter specifically exempted, there shall be paid by each merchant and manufacturer a tax at the rate of one-third of one per centum on the gross value in money of all goods, wares, and merchandise sold, bartered, or exchanged for domestic consumption in the Philippine Islands, * * *.\u00a0 This tax shall be assessed on the actual selling price at which every such merchant or manufacturer disposes of his commodities, and shall be paid at the end of each quarter in the sum lawfully due on the gross amount in money of the sales made by every such merchant or manufacturer during each such quarter.<br\/><br\/>\"SEC. 140.\u00a0 Every person who on his own account, or on commission for another, is engaged in the sale, barter, or exchange of foreign or domestic goods, wares, or merchandise of any and all kinds for domestic consumption, * * * shall be considered as a merchant within the meaning of this article.\"<br\/><br\/>\"SEC. 142.\u00a0 The following persons shall be exempted from the payment of the taxes imposed in section one hundred and thirty-nine:<br\/><br\/>\"(<i>a<\/i>) Agriculturists, on all products of their own production sold by them.<br\/><br\/>\"(<i>b<\/i>) Exporters, on the raw material and manufactured or partially manufactured products actually exported by them.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Plaintiff and appellee does not deny appellant's first proposition, but he contends that goods sold for exportation out of the Islands are not \"goods sold for domestic consumption in the Philippine Islands,\" in the sense in which that term is used in section 139 of the law, and that since the products in question were sold for export, as evidenced by the signed certificates secured from the purchasers, and were in fact exported, the imposition of a tax of a third of one per centum of the value of the products thus sold was not warranted or authorized by the provisions of law upon which the Collector of Internal Revenue based his action in that regard.<br\/><br\/>The issue thus raised is limited to a question as to the legislative intent in enacting section 139 of Act No. 1189 above cited, and the meaning which should be given to the words \"goods sold for domestic consumption\" as used therein.<br\/><br\/>Revenue laws are not, like penal laws, to be construed strictly in favor of the individual and against the State.\u00a0 They are rather to be regarded as remedial in their character, enacted for the promotion of the public welfare, and as such to be given, where possible, a construction which will tend to carry out the manifest intention of the legislator in placing them upon the statute book. (Cliquot's Champagne, 3 Wall., 114; U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. 28 Casks of Wine, 7 Int. Rev. Rec, 4; U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. 36 Barrels of High Wines, 12 Int. Rev. Rec, 40; U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. 100 Barrels of Spirits, 12 Int. Rev. Rec, 153; U S. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>. Stowell, 133 U. S., 1.)\u00a0 And in the case of U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Hodson (10 Wall., 406), the Supreme Court of the United States, holding that such statutes are to be construed liberally so as to carry out the purpose of their enactment, declared that the general rule that that which is implied in a statute is as much a part of the enactment as that which is expressed, is as applicable to revenue laws as to statutes generally.\u00a0 These principles of construction are not necessarily in conflict with the special canons of construction relied upon by the appellee who, with reason, insists that \"a tax can not be imposed without clear and express words for that purpose,\" and cites from the opinion in the case of U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. 36 Barrels of High Wines, as follows:<br\/>\n<blockquote>\"The internal-revenue laws should be construed reasonably and fairly so as not to be made a trap to deceive or catch the innocent and well-intentioned who endeavor to render full obedience to the law;\"<br\/><\/blockquote>And from U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Watts, Fed. Cas. 16653, as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"The internal-revenue laws can not be so construed as to extend their meaning beyond the clear import of the words used.\u00a0 It is the duty of the courts of the Union, undoubtedly, so far as they are invested with any agency in carrying out the financial purposes of the Government, fairly to enforce the revenue laws of the country, and see that they are not fraudulently evaded, but they are not at liberty, by construction or legal fiction, to enlarge their scope to include subjects of taxation not within the terms of the law.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Keeping in mind these principles of construction, what meaning is to be given to the words \"goods sold for domestic consumption,\" in sections 139 and 140 of the Act?<br\/><br\/>Act \"No. 1189, as appears from its title, is \"An Act to provide revenue for the support of the Insular, provincial, and municipal governments, by internal taxation,\" and is general in its nature and application. Article 16 of the Act, which embraces sections 139, 140, and 142, treats generally, as appears from its title, of the imposition of an internal-revenue \"Tax on business, manufacture, and occupation.\" Section 139, also general in its nature, undertakes to prescribe the tax which is to be collected from merchants and manufacturers ,on account of sales, barters, or exchanges of commodities in these Islands, exempting, nevertheless, from the operation of its provisions certain classes of persons specifically mentioned in section 142, and limiting its operations to \"goods, wares, and merchandise sold, bartered, or exchanged for domestic consumption in the Philippine Islands.\" The only reason suggested, which induced the Philippine Commission to impose this limitation on the operation of the provisions of this section was the necessity of avoiding the possibility of an infringement upon the reserved right of Congress to impose import and export duties in the Philippine Islands.\u00a0 But this reason has no application, where no tax is laid upon the commodities as exports, or because of their exportation or intended exportation, or upon persons who actually export such commodities, as sufficiently appears from the following citation from the opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Coe <i>vs<\/i>. Errol (116 U. S., 525-527) :<br\/><blockquote>\"Do the owner's state of mind, in relation to the goods, that is, his intent to export them, and his partial preparation to do so, exempt them from taxation?\u00a0 This is the precise question for solution.<br\/><br\/>\"When the products of the farm or the forest are collected and brought in from the surrounding country to a town or station serving as an entrepot for that particular region, whether on a river or a line of railroad, such products are not yet exports, nor are they in process of exportation, nor is exportation begun until they are committed to the common carrier for transportation out of the State to the State of their destination, or have started on their ultimate passage to that State.\u00a0 Until then it is reasonable to regard them as not only within the State of their origin, but as a part of the general mass of property of that State, subject to its jurisdiction, and liable to taxation there, if not taxed by reason of their being intended for exportation, but taxed without any discrimination, in the usual way and manner in which such property is taxed in the State.<br\/><br\/>\"Of course they can not be taxed as exports; that is to say, they can not be taxed by reason or because of their exportation or intended exportation; for that would amount to laying a duty on exports, and would be a plain infraction of the Constitution, which prohibits any State, without the consent of Congress, from laying any imposts or duties on imports or exports; and, although it has been decided (Woodruff <i>vs<\/i>. Parham, 8 Wall., 123) that this clause relates to imports from and exports to foreign countries, yet when such imposts or duties are laid on imports or exports from one State to another, it can not be doubted that such an imposition would be a regulation of commerce among the States, therefore, void as an invasion of the exclusive power of Congress. (See Walling <i>vs<\/i>. Michigan,, <i>ante<\/i> 446, decided at the present term, and cases cited in the opinion in that case.)\u00a0 But if such goods are not taxed as exports, nor by reason of their exportation, or intended exportation, but are taxed as part of the general mass of property in the State, at the regular period of assessment for such property and in the usual manner, they not being in course of transportation at the time, is there any valid reason why they should not be taxed?\u00a0 Though intended for exportation, they may never be exported; the owner has a perfect right to change his mind; and until actually put in motion, for some place out of the State, or committed to the custody of a carrier for transportation to such place, why may they not be regarded as still remaining a part of the general mass of property in the State?\u00a0 If assessed in an exceptional time or manner, because of their anticipated departure, they might well be considered as taxed by reason of their exportation or intended exportation; but if assessed in the usual way, when not under motion or shipment, we do not see why the assessment may not be valid and binding.<br\/><br\/>*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>\"But no definite rule has been adopted with regard to the point of time at which the taxing power of the State ceases as to <i>goods exported to a foreign country or to another State<\/i>. What we have already said, however, in relation to the products of a State intended for exportation to another State will indicate the view which seems to us the sound one on that subject, namely, that such goods do not cease to be part of the general mass of property in the State, subject, as such, to its jurisdiction, and to taxation in the usual way, until they have been shipped, or entered with a common carrier for transportation to another State, or have been started upon such transportation in a continuous route or journey. We think that this must be the true rule on the subject.<br\/><\/blockquote>It is evident, therefore, that the reason for the limitation imposed upon the operation of the provisions of section 139 does not suggest a construction of the language used which would exempt merchants from the tax in question on account of the barter, sale, or exchange of commodities intended for ultimate export, or which as a matter of fact are ultimately exported, where it does not appear that such merchant is himself an exporter or has actually exported such commodities.<br\/><br\/>It will be observed further that such a construction would go far to defeat the whole purpose of the provisions of the section in question; for a holding that a tax must be collected on account of all sales, barters, or exchanges of commodities in these Islands, save only those which are intended for export and are in fact ultimately exported, would impose an intolerable burden not only upon the government and its officials charged with the impracticable duty of collecting the tax, but upon all traders and middlemen, who would be compelled to submit to the inconvenience and annoyance entailed by any system of inspection whereby the products of the country could be kept under perpetual surveillance, to determine whether the fact that they have ultimately been exported entitles those who at any time prior thereto have sold, bartered, or exchanged such commodities, to exemption from the payment of taxes which otherwise they would be compelled to pay.<br\/><br\/>Applying the rules of interpretation above cited, it is clear that a construction should be rejected which gives to the language used in the exception a meaning not required to accomplish the purpose for which the exception was inserted by the legislator, and which tends to defeat the ends which are sought to be attained by the enactment of the provision wherein the exception is found, unless it appears that the language of the exception is not susceptible of some other fair and reasonable construction, to which such objections can not be raised.<br\/><br\/>The executive branch of the Government has given the phrase in question a construction, which seems to us to come fairly and reasonably within the meaning of the language used, and to be free from objection.\u00a0 In a letter in the record, written by the Secretary of Finance and Justice, it is said that, \"The phrase 'for domestic consumption' is used in the large, general sense of being used for the purpose of commerce in the Philippine Islands;\" and this is the construction which has uniformly been placed upon this section by the officers of the Government charged with its execution, since the date of its enactment.\u00a0 The same idea is expressed in slightly different language by the Solicitor-General in his brief, as follows;<br\/><blockquote>\"The purpose of the Act being to tax all merchants except those exempted in express terms, it is reasonable and fair to conclude that the Commission used the word \"consumption\" in a broader sense than it ordinarily signifies:\u00a0 and that it was here meant, not the total destruction of the thing sold, but its use or consumption in a commercial sense; that is, of transfer by sale, barter, or exchange from one to another in the Philippine Islands.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In the connection wherein the phrase under consideration is found, we think that without in any wise enlarging or limiting the meaning of the word \"consumption\" used therein, it may fairly and reasonably be regarded as equivalent to the words, \"use, commercial or otherwise,\" so that the entire phrase may be rendered as follows:\u00a0 \"All goods, wares, and merchandise sold, bartered, or exchanged for domestic\" use, commercial or otherwise, \"in the Philippine Islands.\"\u00a0 In this sense no sale, barter, or exchange of goods, other than a transaction which actually involves their export from the Philippine Islands can be regarded as excepted from the operation of the provisions of section 139 of the Act; and the fact that either the vendor or purchaser or both, intend the goods for ultimate export, or that the goods are actually and ultimately exported, in no wise affects the \"domestic\" nature of commercial transactions in such goods in the Philippine Islands prior to the ultimate sale, barter, or exchange, by virtue of which the goods are actually exported.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for plaintiff and appellee lays great stress on the fact that the section in question has been amended, since the date of the transactions\u00a0 out of which this action arose, by striking out therefrom the words \"for domestic consumption.\"\u00a0 It is contended that the construction placed upon this section by the defendant Internal Revenue Collector before the amendment is precisely the same as that which must be given to the language of the section as amended, in violation of the elementary rule of construction, that where possible, some meaning should be given to legislative acts, and any construction which renders such acts nugatory or of no effect is to be avoided.\u00a0 This conclusion would be entitled to consideration were it not for the fact that the record contains certain correspondence of the Secretary of Finance and Justice, introduced by the plaintiff without objection, which fully and sufficiently explains the action of the Legislature in making the amendment.\u00a0 Ruling on a protest of the chamber of commerce of Manila, based on the precise issue raised by plaintiff in this action, that officer of the Government\u00a0 (who himself drafted Act No. 1189, and was a member of the small body which enacted it), in the course of an exhaustive examination of the question submitted, made use of the following language:<br\/>\n<blockquote>\"This subject was thoroughly discussed by the Commission when the Internal Revenue Law was enacted, and its construction at that time was precisely that now adopted by the Collector of Internal Revenue.\u00a0 If the language adopted is not sufficiently plain to express that construction, it should be made so by an amendment to the law, but it is believed that it is entirely competent to accomplish the purpose.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In the light of these observations, we do not think that the fact that an amendment was made along, the lines indicated, justifies the inference as to the intention of the legislature, or as to the meaning of the language originally used, which plaintiff attempts to establish.<br\/><br\/>It is suggested that the fact that subsection (<i>b<\/i>) of section 142 specifically exempts exporters from the payment of the tax, renders the use of the phrase, in the sense given to it by the defendant Collector of Internal Revenue, wholly superfluous and unnecessary; and indeed this appears to be the view taken by the Commission, when the amendment was adopted.\u00a0 But redundant words or phrases are not infrequently found in legislative enactments, and only the most skillfully drawn statutes are entirely free from such defects.\u00a0 So, while it is true that an effort should be made to give some meaning to every part of a statute, this rule does not impose upon the courts an imperative obligation to give to every redundant word or phrase a special signification, contrary to the manifest intention of the legislator; and a possible interpretation of a word or phrase which tends to defeat the whole purpose of the law is to be rejected, when the use of such words or phrase may fairly and properly be treated as a mere repetition or reiteration of other language in the statute, in itself sufficient to carry out the intention of the legislator.<br\/><br\/>Finally, as to this branch of the case, we think that, if after an examination of the language of the Act itself, any doubt remained as to the proper construction to be given the phrase in question, the uniform construction placed upon the statute by the executive officers charged with its execution, should be respected and adopted, if necessary to resolve the doubt.<br\/><blockquote>\"In case of ambiguity in a statute, contemporaneous and uniform executive construction is regarded as decisive.\"\u00a0 (Brown <i>vs<\/i>. U. S., 113 U. S., 568).<br\/><br\/>\"Where the language of a series of statutes is dubious, and open to different interpretations, the construction put upon them by the Executive Department charged with their execution has great and general controlling force with this court.\"\u00a0 (St. Paul, Minneapolis, etc., Railway Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Phelps, 137 U. S., 528.)<br\/><br\/>\"It is a rule well established that the construction given to a statute by those charged with the duty of executing it will be given great weight by the courts if the true construction be doubtful.\"\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Hill, 120 U. S., 169.)<br\/><\/blockquote>The second branch of the case does not present so much difficulty.\u00a0 We think there can be no doubt that the appellee was acting in its capacity as a commission merchant when it bought and shipped goods, wares, and merchandise to its patrons, and received compensation therefor, and that the tax imposed on account of these transactions was properly and lawfully imposed.\u00a0 In effect, these transactions constituted sales of the goods by plaintiff company to its correspondents in the provinces, and the so-called commission charged by plaintiff company represented the profits upon the goods sold.\u00a0 The relations of the parties to the contract were those of buyer and seller, and the mere fact that the vendor did not keep the goods sold in stock did not make it any the less a merchant in relation to these transactions, than if the goods had been stored in its warehouses at the time when the orders were received.\u00a0 The real question is whether or not there was a sale or exchange of the goods shipped by plaintiff company in response to the orders and requests of its provincial correspondents.\u00a0 As has been suggested by the Solicitor-General in his brief, most merchants engaged in the so-called \"mail-order business\" (which in some communities has developed into a business of no mean proportions) make no pretense of carrying any stocks on hand, and their profits consist of a fixed and agreed upon commission on the value of the goods sold.\u00a0 It will hardly be contended that the persons engaged in business of this nature are not merchants within the meaning of the Act, or that their transactions are not such as to justify the imposition of the tax in question.<br\/><br\/>We find no merit in appellee's contention that the imposition of the tax in question was an imposition of the tax upon two different persons for one and the same sale, or a double imposition of the tax on one person for and on account of the same transaction.\u00a0 In the language of the appellee's own brief, under the provisions of the law, \"when the same item of merchandise is sold several times, each successive seller is subject to the tax, the amount of which varies with the selling price,\" so that \"if an article is sold twice, two taxes have properly accrued; if five times, five taxes.\" If instead of ordering and buying directly from a manufacturer or wholesale merchant, I elect to buy through a middleman or commission merchant, paying him such profit as he elects to charge, or a fixed and agreed upon percentage of the wholesale value of the goods, it may be true that in a certain sense I have purchased the goods from the manufacturer or wholesale dealer, and that the middleman or commission merchant is merely an \"agent or-messenger who does the buying for me,\" whom \"for reasons of convenience I send to make the purchase for me,\" but it is very clear that it is the intention of the law, definitely and explicitly stated in its general provisions, that such commission merchants who receive compensation for such services shall pay a tax as well as the manufacturer or wholesaler.<br\/><br\/>If a merchant in Manila buys rice from a dealer in Pampanga, and barters or exchanges this rice for hemp with a hemp factor in Albay, the law clearly imposes a tax upon the Pampanga rice dealer of one-third of 1 percent of the value of the rice sold to the merchant in Manila; a tax on the merchant in Manila of one-third of 1 per cent of the value of the rice delivered by him in exchange with the hemp factor in Albay; and a tax on the hemp factor in Albay of one-third of 1 per cent of the value of the hemp delivered to the merchant in Manila in exchange for rice. If the hemp merchant in Manila elects, as a matter of convenience, to pay not only the tax imposed upon him, but the tax payable by one or both of the other parties, for and on their behalf, this fact by no means changes the nature of the transaction, nor does it justify a complaint, on the ground that the merchant in Manila has paid taxes twice or thrice upon the same series of transactions, or because each of the three parties to the transaction have been compelled to pay a separate tax for his respective participation therein.<br\/><br\/>Some question seems to have been made as to the title acquired by the plaintiff company in the goods purchased by it for the purpose of filling the orders of its provincial correspondents.\u00a0 We think there can be no doubt that while the plaintiff company may have purchased such goods with the ultimate intention, and for the purpose, of filling its correspondents' orders therewith, nevertheless, it purchased such goods on its own account and acquired a perfect title therein.\u00a0 If bought on credit, in accordance with the general custom of merchants in Manila, the vendor looked exclusively to the plaintiff company for payment, and could in no event have held the persons, for whom the goods were ultimately intended, responsible for the purchase price; and it is not apparent how the plaintiff company's provincial correspondents could have had recourse against the original vendor of such goods, in the event of failure on the part of the plaintiff company to comply with its obligations touching the shipment of such goods to them.\u00a0 Until the plaintiff company actually shipped the goods to their provincial correspondents, it had exclusive control thereof, and could make such use of these goods as it saw fit; and if it so desired it could refuse to ship them to the person for whom they were originally intended, and divert them to some other purchaser.\u00a0 While it was agreed that the shipment of the goods should be at the risk of the company's provincial correspondents, there is no suggestion that the holding of these goods in their go downs pending shipment was in like manner at the risk of their correspondents, or that they had any control whatever over such goods until they were actually shipped to them.<br\/><br\/>The transfer of this right of ownership from the plaintiff company to their provincial correspondents can only be satisfactorily explained on the theory that the transaction was either a sale, barter or exchange of such goods, and, as such, subject to the tax in question.\u00a0 It matters not in what form the transaction appears, as a matter of bookkeeping, on plaintiff company's books, its nature and essence remain the same.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the trial court should be reversed, and judgment entered in favor of the defendant for the costs of the proceedings in first instance.\u00a0 No costs will be allowed in this instance.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

ANICETO MONTELIBANO.<br\/><br\/>\"DEAR COUSIN:\u00a0 I address you this letter on account of the money which you have drawn from papa, and concerning which I am obliged to write you, to see if it is possible for you to pay us, and I think that you must know the source of this money, and that several are the owners of it; therefore I, as executor, am the one who writes you this letter, and you should take into account the time that said money has been in your hands, and we have been awaiting from this date, therefore, cousin, I expect you to pay us.<br\/>\"With nothing to\u00a0 add, I am\u00a0 your affectionate cousin.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: right;\">\"FELIX ARANETA.\"<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"MY DEAR COUSIN:\u00a0 I have read the letter, and on this very day I am getting ready to leave on account of a delicate matter, principally about myself, so that you will pardon me if I have only answered here; cousin, your silence during ail of this time causes me every day more and more vexation and grief, and it should have been paid by me long ago; but, what can I do when money is lacking, I have hardly enough for family expenses, and if I could only have realized on land I would have invited (sic) you, on account of the vexation I have when thinking of the debt, therefore, cousin, I leave this matter in your hands and if you can no longer have for me the same consideration that you had before, I am at your orders, and in case your answer reaches me here, because I have to leave to-morrow, I pray you to, write me and deliver (your letter) to Bibing, my daughter, in order that she may forward it to me, and, cousin, you must not think that I am going to give you trouble, but what can I do now ?<br\/><br\/>\"Kind regards to yourself and family, and command your affectionate cousin who loves you all, and kisses your hand,<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: right;\">\"ANICETO M. LIBAN.\"<\/div><\/blockquote><br\/>These letters do not show whether a demand was made for the payment of the P6,000 in question or not.\u00a0 There was no proof adduced during the trial showing that the demand was made for the payment of the said P6,000.\u00a0 Felix de la Cruz, the person who carried the letter and presented it to Aniceto Montelibano, said that while he knew it was for the purpose of making a collection of money, he did not know to what particular money the demand related.<br\/><br\/>During the trial of the cause, the defendant offered proof showing\u00a0 that some time (the date not appearing) during the lifetime of the said Hermenegildo Araneta, the said Aniceto Montelibano sold the land in question to one Leon Lopez, with the knowledge and consent\u00a0 of the said Araneta; that the said Leon Lopez entered into the possession of the said property, and paid to the said Hermenegildo Araneta during his lifetime at least a part of the said P6,000, and that the said Lopez is still in possession of the said property; that the said parcel of land was thereafter never considered a part of the estate of the said Aniceto Montelibano.\u00a0 The plaintiff made no effort to refute this proof of the defendant.<br\/><br\/>After hearing the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause, the lower court made the following findings of fact:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"I find the facts to be that on April 13, 1887, the contract that is set up in the complaint was executed.\u00a0 Previous to that time, Aniceto Montelibano was the owner of this <i>hacienda<\/i> (the parcel of land in question); on that date he received P6,000 from Hermenegildo Araneta and gave him this contract, by which he conveyed to the said Araneta this <i>hacienda<\/i>, with the condition that if the P6,000 was not paid back within four years from that date, then the <i>hacienda<\/i> should become the property of Hermenegildo Araneta, and if it was not paid back then Aniceto would execute in favor of Hermenegildo Araneta, a public document of conveyance, conveying the said <i>hacienda<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>\"I find also that the money was not paid back within that time, and that at the expiration of that time the duty rested upon Aniceto Montelibano to execute a public document of conveyance.\u00a0 Both the parties were living at that time and lived for a long time afterwards, and whether there was any agreement between them as to changing that contract, there is no evidence showing it, except their contract.<br\/><br\/>\"I find that Aniceto Montelibano continued upon the <i>hacienda<\/i> after the execution of this paper under the contract of lease that is set up in the complaint, and that about fourteen years ago, and in the lifetime of both of these parties, this <i>hacienda<\/i> was conveyed to Leon Lopez and went out of the possession of Aniceto Montelibano and into the possession of Leon Lopez and has continued in the possession of Lopez down to the present time.\u00a0 This change of possession of the <i>hacienda<\/i> must have been known to Hermenegildo Araneta, and the allegations in the answer are that it was with his consent * * * and the allegation of the answer is that after that conveyance, Lopez assumed the remainder of this debt to Hermenegildo Araneta and that he paid a portion of it to him before his death and subsequently paid the balance to the heirs of the estate.<br\/><br\/>\"I find further that at the time of Aniceto Montelibano's death, he was not in possession of the property; that it did not go into his estate in any way; that it was not included in the inventory of his estate, and that none of that property came into the hands of the tutor of the minor heirs of Aniceto Montelibano.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>The court concluded with the following statement:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"I feel, under all the circumstances, that the whole matter was arranged between the parties and that the sale that was made to Lopez was made with the consent of Hermenegildo Araneta, for the purpose of settling up and arranging Hermenegildo Araneta's claim,\u00a0 and I am inclined to believe the fact suggested by the witness Alejandro Montelibano, that after that conveyance to Lopez, the balance of the debt that was unpaid, was paid by him and so discharged.\u00a0 I may not be right in this matter, but if I am not it is the result of the negligence of the parties who owned the claim.\u00a0 I think if a party owns a claim of P6,000, with good security on it, and stands for sixteen years without doing anything about it, that it is a fair presumption that it has been settled in some way, and upon all the evidence I am inclined to enter judgment for the defendant to recover upon the amount that the plaintiff has not established his right to recover, and it is so ordered that the defendant recover his costs.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>From this judgment of the lower court the plaintiff appealed, making several assignments of error, all of which relate to the sufficiency of the proof to sustain the plaintiff's claim.\u00a0 There was no proof whatever offered by the plaintiff showing that the original indebtedness had not been paid.\u00a0 The plaintiff seemed to rely upon the fact that his possession of the original document was sufficient proof that the same had not been paid.\u00a0 Possession of a document calling for the payment of money is not conclusive proof that the amount called for in the document has not been paid.\u00a0 The defendant offered evidence to the effect that a part of the obligation created in said contract had been satisfied by one Lopez.\u00a0 The plaintiff offered no proof whatever to rebut that fact.<br\/><br\/>We have given the substance of the proof adduced during the trial and the conclusions of the court thereon above.<br\/><br\/>It will be noted from an examination of the prayer of the complaint of the plaintiff that he asks two remedies:<br\/><br\/>First.\u00a0 That the defendant, the tutor of the minor children of the deceased Aniceto Montelibano, execute and deliver to him a conveyance for the land described in the complaint; and<br\/><br\/>Second.\u00a0 That the defendant deliver to the plaintiff the possession of the land in question.<br\/><br\/>The defendant alleged that he did not have possession of the property at the time he answered, and that he never did have possession of the said land.\u00a0 An action for the specific recovery of the possession of real property must be brought against the one\u00a0 who is actually or constructively in possession of the same.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the demand of the plaintiff for the execution and delivery of a conveyance or deed of the land in question by the defendant, the lower court found that the land in question had been sold and transferred to Leon Lopez with the knowledge and consent of the deceased Hermenegildo Araneta.\u00a0 The proof shows clearly that the defendants never had possession of the land in question, and that they had never made any claim whatsoever to said property.<br\/><br\/>Upon the question of the sale of the land in question to Leon Lopez, the proof is meager.\u00a0 The statements of Alejandro Montelibano seem to be more or less doubtful and contradictory.\u00a0 Had the alleged sale actually been made, it would seem that Lopez would have been one of the best witnesses to prove that fact.\u00a0 He was one of the parties to the alleged transaction.\u00a0 He was still living at the time of the trial, yet he was not called to testify.\u00a0 No writing or document, public or private, was presented in support of the alleged sale.\u00a0 At the time of the alleged sale the four years had expired and Araneta had a right to a deed to the land.\u00a0 Montelibano was a mere tenant.\u00a0 He could not sell the land.\u00a0 The land belonged to Araneta.\u00a0 Lopez could not obtain title to the land from Montelibano without the intervention of Araneta.\u00a0 Lopez, if the allegations of Montelibano are true, must have had full\u00a0 knowledge of what actually transpired.\u00a0 His testimony upon that question would be of the greatest importance in the solution of the question presented by the defendant.<br\/><br\/>The mere fact that the land in question was not included in the inventory of the estate of Aniceto Montelibano does not show that it had been sold to Lopez.\u00a0 <i>(See<\/i> Lim- Chingco <i>vs.<\/i> Terariray, 5 Phil. Rep., 120.)<br\/><br\/>A serious objection exists as to parties against the form of the present action.\u00a0 The plaintiff alleges in his complaint that Aniceto Montelibano died on the 20th of December, 1898, intestate, leaving four minor children, called Bibiana, Maria, Rosario, and Raymundo.\u00a0 In the present action, however, the plaintiff made defendants Braulio Montelibano, as tutor of said minor children, Rosario, Raymundo, and Bibiana.\u00a0 The record does not show why Maria was not made a party defendant.\u00a0 Until the contrary is shown, each of these heirs has\" an equal interest in the property in question.<br\/><br\/>It would seem clear that the present action could not be concluded without having all of the heirs in court.<br\/><br\/>There is also the other question whether an action can be brought against an administrator or tutor for the purpose of compelling him to carry out a contract for the conveyance of land under the circumstances existing in this case.\u00a0 Under the provisions of article 661 of the Civil Code, the heirs, by virtue of the right of succession, are subrogated to all the rights and obligations of the deceased.\u00a0 The heirs are no more than the continuation of the juridical personality of their predecessor in interest.\u00a0 (Decision of the supreme court of Spain, January 28, 1892; Mojica <i>vs.<\/i> Fernandez, 9 Phil. Rep., 403.)<br\/><br\/>The heirs having succeeded to whatever interest their ancestry had in the land and contract in question, they may, by virtue of articles 1279 and 1280 of the Civil Code, be compelled in a proper action to execute the public instrument required under the contract between their ancestor and Araneta.\u00a0 (Mojica <i>vs.<\/i> Fernandez, 9 Phil. Rep., 403.)\u00a0 All of the heirs were not made parties defendant in the present action.\u00a0 Apart of them can not be\u00a0 required to execute the document prayed for by the plaintiff.\u00a0 They must all be made parties defendant.\u00a0 They are all equally interested.\u00a0 Of course when they are all made parties they will be permitted to show, providing they have evidence to justify it, that Leon Lopez was, by the consent of the said Araneta, substituted for their ancestor in the contract which the representatives of the said Araneta are now attempting to enforce.\u00a0 That is a question of defense.\u00a0 Whether Leon Lopez, being actually in possession (if that\u00a0 is so) should be made a party defendant in the present action, we do not decide.<br\/><br\/>For the reason, therefore, that all of the heirs of the said Aniceto Montelibano were not made parties in the present action, the judgment of the lower court is hereby revoked and the cause is\u00a0 hereby remanded to the lower court, with permission on the part of the plaintiff to amend his complaint.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Furthermore, as the plaintiff did not oppose or except to the giving of such oral testimony during the trial in the lower court, the objection that he now for the first time presents on appeal is absolutely out of place and therefore useless and improper.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff also assigns as error the denial by the lower court of his motion for, new trial on the ground of the discovery of new evidence.\u00a0 This alleged newly discovered evidence consists of a certificate of the resolution passed by the municipal council of Santa, in its session held on December 15, 1905, to the effect that said council, at the request of the plaintiff, had <i>stated<\/i> (sic) to the latter that \"the members thereof are satisfied that the house in question is his property and not the property of Antonio Bernal, his grandson.\"<br\/><br\/>The lower court acted very properly in denying said motion for a new trial because:\u00a0 (1) the statement made to the plaintiff by the municipal council of Santa as to whom they, or the members thereof, regarded as the true owner of the house in question, does not change nor could it in any manner affect the result of the case; and (2) because said statement having been requested and obtained by the plaintiff himself in December 1905, it is obvious that, when he filed his complaint in June, 1906, he should have had knowledge thereof and could very well have offered it at the trial, had he deemed it convenient, for it was in his power to secure all the certificates he wanted relating to the resolution of the said municipal council as to the said statement.\u00a0 Newly discovered evidence is a name that would wrongly be applied to evidence already known to the plaintiff and which, even before the bringing of this action, it was in his power to offer to the court.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed with the costs of this instance against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

The court below erred by declaring valid the attachment levied by Ildefonso Doronila on the thirty-six parcels of land in question and the sales that\u00a0 took place in consequence thereof.<br\/><br\/>\"2. The court below erred by declaring that an agreement was entered into between the heirs of the spouses Martin Depi\u00f1o and Fructuosa Disolong for the purchase, from Ruperto Montinola, of the said thirty-six parcels of land.<br\/><br\/>\"3. The court below erred when admitting as evidence Exhibit No. 5 of the plaintiffs.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>With respect to the first error, it is incorrectly affirmed that the court below declared valid the attachment levied by Ildefonso Doronila and the sales subsequently made.\u00a0 The trial judge has stated quite clearly that the sale carried out at the request of Doronila could only prejudice Santos Depi\u00f1o; that the property of one person could not be sold by reason of the debts of another; that the sale was valid as far as it referred to the interest of Santos Depi\u00f1o, that is, as to the one-sixth part that could be disposed of, and that with respect to Santos Depi\u00f1o, in view of the fact that he did not exercise his right of legal redemption with respect to his share, the sale of said sixth part became final or absolute, \"and it is probably true that it was not so with reference to all the others.\"\u00a0 (B. of E. 10.)<br\/><br\/>The correctness of the opinion of the trial judge with regard to the efficacy of all such acts wherein none of the other coheirs of Santos Depi\u00f1o had taken part, is a point that is beyond all doubt.<br\/><br\/>But the court below considered that it was proven that some of the\u00a0 coheirs of Santos Depi\u00f1o entered into an agreement with Paulino Doliendo, the husband of one coheiress, to the effect that he should look for some money, about P800, to be used in purchasing from the last possessor, Montinola, the thirty-six parcels of land, rather than in the prosecution of claims; after the purchase they were to remain in their possession in order to work the land and with the products of the same to reimburse themselves for the money paid, and, after reimbursement, to divide the land between\u00a0 all the coheirs.<br\/><br\/>The existence of this agreement, as alleged by the plaintiffs and which they attempted to prove by means of document Exhibit No. 5, is the only question in this suit; the only one decided upon in the judgment of the lower court, and the only one which can be decided on appeal to this superior court.<br\/><br\/>In connection therewith, the plaintiff Paulino Doliendo declared that when he heard that Montinola was selling these properties, he sent a message to him asking if it were true; that he took this step in consequence of an agreement made with Santos and other coheirs who told him to go and see the said gentleman, and they compelled him to purchase the land; that the heirs Santos, Dionisio, Bernabe, Perpetua, and Buenavista, because the wife of the witness is also an heir, met at his house on the 15th of June, 1906, and, together with the witness, there agreed that he should obtain the money in order to purchase the land before it passed into the hands of any outside party; that he dealt with Montinola, securing the money at a high rate of interest, and made the purchase at the price of P800.<br\/><br\/>On the 28th of the same month of June, 1906, Montinola, by means of a notarial instrument executed for the purpose, sold to Paulino Doliendo, Bruno Paredes, and Fermin Liza the thirty-six parcels of land in question for the sum of P800, stating therein:<br\/><blockquote>\"Which lands are my own property, acquired by purchase on the 24th of February, 1905, from Ildefonso Doronila, who sold them to me under <i>pacto de retro<\/i>; the period of time for redemption expired on the 24th of February, 1906, and in consequence thereof the sale was irrevocably consummated.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In proof of the agreement entered into on the 15th of June, 1906, at the house of Doliendo, the plaintiffs presented Exhibit No, 5, executed by the plaintiffs herein, Doliendo, Parodes, and Liza or Desa; it consisted of several clauses and was signed by them and two witnesses for the purpose of insuring the farming of the lands as tenants thereof, \"for\u00a0 humanitarian reasons\" with respect to \"the heirs named Dionisia Depi\u00f1o, Bernabe Belandres, Dionisio Depi\u00f1o, Perpetua Buenavista, and Santos Depi\u00f1o, and, after reimbursing the purchasers in the sum of P800 to acknowledge all the heirs as owners, including Paulino Doliendo, the purchaser, who is also one of the heirs, with the exception of the said Fermin Desa because he is not an heir,\" and, on the other hand, providing that the heirs could not demand partition until the P800 had been reimbursed, to the payment of which the products of the lands were to be devoted.<br\/><br\/>The defendants objected to the admission of the said document for the reason that 'it was not signed by the parties; the lower court, however, admitted it and based its decision on the opinion that it had formed of the motives and the conditions of the purchase, and the tenancy of the lands according to what has been hereinbefore set forth.<br\/><br\/>Juan Cartagena, the notary who was to have signed the notarial declaration that was made out at the end of the document, but which was later scratched out, declares:<br\/><br\/>That on the 30th of June, 1906, the plaintiffs and the defendants, with the exception of one, Santos Depi\u00f1o, called on him in order to have the said agreement drawn up.<br\/><blockquote>\"They (the defendants) were the only ones who asked me to legalize and make out the document, and I certified the same as a notary, and after the document was certified they wanted to keep it in their hands.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 And why did you my that the defendants had no need to sign the document because it was in their favor; what did you mean by it?-A.\u00a0 They were the only ones who insisted on my writing out the document and that they would pay me my fees.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Dionisio Depi\u00f1o says that when his father died, his mother and his brother, Santos Depi\u00f1o, were in possession of the lands.<br\/><br\/>Bernabe Belandres, one of the defendants, admits that lie went to the house of the notary in company with three coheirs, Dionisio Depi\u00f1o, Perpetua Buenavista, and Dionisia.\u00a0 Perpetua Buenavista states that she went with Dionisio, Dionisia, and Consolacion.\u00a0 All of them, including Dionisio Depi\u00f1o, deny having assented to the agreement because there was no reason why they should buy what belonged to them.<br\/><br\/>The judge below, assuming that the proceedings instituted by Doronila for the collection of his credit were legal, says:\u00a0 \"I believe that they were regular, and as such we have accepted them in this matter.\"\u00a0 The result of the public auction, and of the adjudication thereof to Doronila was that he entered into possession of the lands, although the said possession was subject to redemption, the right to which devolved\u00a0 upon the debtor, and at the risk of intervention on the part of the other coheirs of the debtor.<br\/><br\/>Doronila could transmit his possession,as he did, to Montinola, subject, however, to the two contingencies, and in addition thereto, to the exercise of a conventional redemption in favor of the same vendor, Doronila, and to the heirs as successors of the original debtor.<br\/><br\/>The periods for the redemptions expired on the 8th and 24th of February, 1906, respectively, and the\u00a0 possession was consolidated in Montinola upon whom, as upon Doronila, devolved the right declared by section 466 of the Code of Civil Procedure; ever since that time every right, title, interest, and right of action of the party against whom execution was accomplished, and which from the time of the judicial sale were subject to the right of redemption,\u00a0 became definitely acquired.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, and at a later date, Montinola was the owner of the share that Santos Depi\u00f1o had in the thirty-six parcels of land in question, and he continued in possession of the whole, as his possession was never made the subject of any action whatever.<br\/><br\/>And the said possession obtained by Doronila of the whole of the lands and transferred upon the sale by Doronila to Montinola, and in turn sold by Montinola to the three plaintiffs, is the same, and it is the sole possession that the court below has declared in its decision to finally belong to the three defendants by virtue of the aforesaid agreement.<br\/><br\/>This court finds that no error can be charged to the estimation of the lower court with respect to the said agreement; the evidence was considered by it in this sense, and against it there was only alleged the rule contained in article 1280 of the Civil Code which\u00a0 provides that acts and contracts, the objects of which are the creation, transmission, modification, or extinction of property rights in real property, must appear in a public instrument; this provision does not require such form in order to validate the act or contract but to insure its efficacy, so that after the existence of the act or contract has been admitted, under the said article of the Civil Code, the party bound may be compelled to execute the document, as has already been held by this court.<br\/><br\/>Neither was error committed by the court below in admitting the existence or truth of the agreement, although it was not signed by the defendants.<br\/><br\/>The lower court was convinced by the preponderance of the evidence, not simply on account of the existence of the document marked Exhibit 5.\u00a0 The court found that some of the heirs met on the 15th of June, 1906, at the house of Paulino Doliendo; that without said agreement the plaintiffs would not have exerted themselves to procure money in order to buy the lands that could not be acquired without the risk of litigation; and that the agreement tended to avoid it, and instead of using the money for the purposes of litigation they thought it better to invest it in the purchase of the parcels of land so that they would revert to the family and that the effect of the said agreement would be:\u00a0 (1) The acquisition of the right of possession of the thirty-six parcels of land such as Montinola had after the 24th of February, 1906; (2) the possession, under antichresis, of the thirty-six\u00a0 parcels of land; (3) the right on the part of the other coheirs to\u00a0 work the land as the tenants thereof; and (4) the division of the property upon the expiration of the antichresis.<br\/><br\/>In this sense the court below confirms the right of the plaintiffs to the possession of the thirty-six parcels of land as against these defendants who appeared before the court, in conformity with\u00a0 the\u00a0 terms of the agreement\u00a0 Exhibit No. 5.<br\/><blockquote>\"Upon issuing this decree-states the trial judge-I do not wish to pass on the rights that Santos may have, because his rights were sold at the sheriff's sale made by Doronila, and said sale may have extinguished his rights, and this probably has happened, but the other heirs would be owners in common, each of them probably possessing one-fifth; but such a question need not be decided in this case, and what I have said in connection therewith must not be considered as a decision.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>And this is the reason why, in the judgment, the trial judge\u00a0 expressly declared:\u00a0 \"This decision does not, of course, bind any person who was not present in court, and who is not a party to the suit.\"<br\/><br\/>With this analysis of the judgment, it is hereby fully confirmed with the costs of this instance against the appellants.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa, Johnson<\/i>, and <i>Willard, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><\/div>",

the said father of Pedro left and returned to his house, where Pedro was informed of what had occurred between his father and Gaudencio, whereupon he went to the house of the latter, and announced on his arrival that he wanted to kill Gaudencio; Eulalia Cabalona heard him, and advised him not to do such a thing, nor carry out his threat, because it was a wicked thing to kill a relative; Pedro then said that he would kill Gaudencio because the latter had insulted his father.\u00a0 After\u00a0 this, Eulalia Cabalona went to her house where, on arrival, she communicated to her husband, Mateo Barbicho, what had taken place, and the latter then said:\u00a0 \"As to the killing, that won't do; if I see him it will be different; we would then both of\u00a0 us have something to say.\"<br\/><br\/>As soon as the above words were uttered by Mateo, they must have been heard by Pedro Barbicho, because he made his appearance near the house and said:\u00a0 \"As you say that I am conceited, come down and prove it, and we will find out whether I dare do what you say I don't, and I will kill you.\"\u00a0 Mateo did not reply to this or do anything, because his wife, Cabalona, intervened and advised the two men not to quarrel so violently, and although at the time more words passed between them, they afterwards apologized to each other, conversed amicably, and renewed their friendly relations.<br\/><br\/>Some days later, at about 10 p. m. on Good Friday, the 17th of April, Pedro Barbicho went to the house of the married couple, Mateo and Eulalia, and greeted them in a friendly manner, and as Mateo saw that Pedro was carrying a dagger, locally called a barao, he told him that he should not carry such a weapon during the sacred days of Holy Week, because the devil lurked in every man; to this advice Pedro answered that Mateo had nothing to do with him, because the weapon was his own; after this conversation, Mateo and his wife and children, and the girl Sergia Escoro, all went to sleep, Pedro Barbicho also remaining there to sleep.\u00a0 Late that same night Mateo, the owner of the house, while sound asleep, was attacked by Pedro Barbicho who, with the above-mentioned weapon, inflicted on him a mortal wound in the left side of the abdomen, and the woman awakened by hearing her husband call out \"Pedro, come back here, what have you done to me?\" struck a light at once and saw that her husband, Mateo, was getting up and that his aggressor, Pedro, was going toward the door in order to leave the house, which he did.\u00a0 The husband then informed her that he had been wounded by Pedro Barbicho, and died a few hours later, about 4 in the morning, due to the very serious wound which he had received.\u00a0 In view of what had occurred, the woman, as soon as she was able, about 6 o'clock on Saturday morning, reported the\u00a0 occurrence to Cornelio, the lieutenant of the barrio of Refugio.<br\/><br\/>A complaint was subsequently filed by the provincial fiscal on the 11th of November, 1908, with the Court of First Instance of Cebu, charging Pedro Barbicho with the crime of murder, in that said crime was committed with premeditation, treachery, and in the house of the deceased; thereupon these proceedings were instituted, and the trial judge, upon the evidence presented, entered judgment therein on the 25th of said month, sentencing the accused, Pedro Barbicho, to the penalty of imprisonment for life, to pay an indemnity of P1,000 to the heirs of the deceased, and the costs of the proceedings; from the said judgment the accused has appealed.<br\/><br\/>The above-stated facts, duly proven in the present case by the testimony of Eulalia Cabalona, the wife of the deceased, the principal details of which are confirmed by Sergia Escoro, the girl who also slept in the house of said married couple on the night of the attack, constitute the crime of murder defined and punished by article 403 of the Penal Code, inasmuch as Mateo Barbicho was attacked, received a mortal wound in the left side of the abdomen while fast asleep with his family, in his own house, and only awoke\u00a0 when receiving the blow and as the weapon penetrated his body.\u00a0 The aggressor, in order to insure the success of his criminal intent and purpose, and the consummation of the crime without any risk to himself as might ensue from such defense as the victim might offer, took advantage of a time while the latter was fast asleep, and under such conditions attacked him.\u00a0 The specific circumstance of treachery was unquestionably present therein, and it is one of those which qualify the crime of homicide and convert it into murder, punished with a heavier penalty.<br\/><br\/>The accused, Pedro Barbicho, stands convicted as the sole participant in said crime, and notwithstanding his denial and exculpatory allegations, the record in the case furnishes incriminating data and sufficient merits to produce in the\u00a0 mind, when duly\u00a0 considered according to the rules of sound criticism, the fullest conviction of the guilt of the accused, it being impossible to consider the preponderance and weight of the evidence as in any way favoring the defense, for the reason that it has been conclusively shown that, shortly before the aggression, the accused made his appearance at the house carrying a dagger, and there remained to sleep without showing any sign of displeasure or resentment; that when Mateo, the assaulted man, woke up because of the wound that he had received, he recognized and asked his aggressor what he, Pedro, had done to him, calling\u00a0 him correctly by his name, while the wife of the wounded man, on striking a light, saw the defendant going toward the door of the staircase in order to leave the house; and that the deceased Mateo, up to the moment of his death, repeatedly stated that he was wounded by his relative Pedro Barbicho, statements which,\u00a0 according to the wife of the deceased and the girl Sergia Escoro, must have been heard by some of the neighbors who went to the house where the crime was committed.\u00a0 Not the slightest suspicion attaches to any person, other than the accused, as being guilty of the crime, and if the latter was not arrested at once it was only because he was not found until the 12th day of May following.<br\/><br\/>In connection with the crime of murder it is proper to consider the presence of the aggravating circumstances of premeditation, a generic one in the present case, and abuse of confidence (subdivisions 7 and 9 [10] of article 10 of the Penal Code), inasmuch as the accused, who lived at a short distance from the house of the deceased, made his appearance therein carrying a deadly weapon without any reasonable motive for so doing, and there remained to sleep, unnecessarily suffering the discomforts due to a room so small that he had to lie down with his head close to the door and his feet almost touching the body of his victim; and inasmuch as that, in spite of the apparent reconciliation and friendly feeling which he displayed in his dealings with his relative after the trouble that the accused and the deceased had had on the\u00a0 previous Tuesday, the former must have been since meditating and carefully maturing his plans and making his arrangements to consummate the threat of death made against the latter when he challenged him on that day, and being bent upon committing the crime, went to the house of the deceased armed with a dagger on Good Friday night, and gained the confidence of the latter through his good behavior as a relative, in order to benefit by it afterwards in causing the latter and his family most serious damage, irreparable <i>per se<\/i>, although one of said aggravating circumstances is compensated by the mitigating one established by article 11 of the\u00a0 code, the adequate penalty, in view of the other aggravating circumstance not compensated, must be imposed in its maximum degree.<br\/><br\/>In regard to the doubt as to whether the accused is over or under 18 years of age, and in the absence of proof that on the day he committed the crime he was 18 years old, he must perforce be considered as still under that age, and therefore, the mitigating circumstance mentioned in paragraph No. 2 of article 9 of the code should be applied in his favor, the penalty next inferior to that imposed by article 403 of the\u00a0 code, and in the maximum degree for the uncompensated circumstance, being applicable under the provisions of article 85, paragraph 2.\u00a0 Hence, the penalty should be that of <i>presidio mayor<\/i> in its maximum degree to <i>cadena temporal<\/i> in its medium degree.<br\/><br\/>By virtue of the considerations above set forth, it is our opinion that the judgment appealed from should be affirmed so far as it agrees with this decision, and that Pedro Barbicho should be and is hereby sentenced to the penalty of seventeen years of <i>cadena temporal<\/i>, to suffer the accessory penalties of article 56 of the Penal Code, to indemnify the widow and heirs of the deceased in the sum of Pl,000, and to pay the costs of both instances.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Rep., 583).\u00a0 The defendant had taken offense at some words used by one Delgado, and threatened to kill him.\u00a0 While Estrada was searching for a revolver, Delgado concealed himself.\u00a0 On the following day Estrada called at Delgado's house and stated that the threat had been utteaed without premeditation, and that it was not seriously made.\u00a0 The court commented upon the fact that it appeared that the defendant had not persisted in carrying out the threat, and held that the offense had only the characteristics of a misdemeanor, and was punishable under article 589, instead of article 494, of the Penal Code.\u00a0 These articles have been construed by this court in several other cases.\u00a0 In United States <i>vs.<\/i> Sevilla (1 Phil. Rep., 143) it appeared that the defendant while beating certain parties said that he would kill them if they did not return his jewels.\u00a0 It was held that the threats dealt with under article 494, are those made with the deliberate purpose of creating in the mind of the person threatened the belief that the threat will be carried into effect, and that under the circumstances of the case the defendant was punishable under article 589, instead of article 494.\u00a0 So in United States <i>vs.<\/i> Simeon (3 Phil. Rep., 388), a person who raised a bolo as if to strike or stab a light watchman, who thereupon ran away, was held guilty under article 589 of threatening another with weapons.<br\/><br\/>In United States <i>vs.<\/i> Casta\u00f1ares (8 Phil. Rep., 730), the defendant having taken offense at some remark, drew a revolver and threatened to kill one Yap\u00a0 Gea, who there-upon fled.\u00a0 The trial court held the defendant guilty of <i>amenaza<\/i> under article 494, but this court was of the opinion that the defendant was guilty only, of the offense declared by section 2 of article 589 of the Penal Code.\u00a0 In United States <i>vs.<\/i> Algurra (9 Phil. Rep.,\u00a0 644), it was held that threats made against another, and in the heat of anger, constituted a misdemeanor only under section 3 of article 589 of the Penal Code.\u00a0 The court there remarked that \"it has not been shown *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 that he threatened them in earnest with the apparent intent to carry the threat into effect.\"<br\/><br\/>Under the authority of these decisions the defendant should have been convicted and punished for a misdemeanor.\u00a0 The sentence is therefore reversed, and the defendant is hereby sentenced to pay a fine of 125 pesetas, and in case of insolvency, to suffer subsidiary imprisonment in the provincial jail of La Union, at the rate of 15 pesetas or P3 a day, said subsidiary imprisonment not to exceed ten days, and to pay the costs of this prosecution.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Ang Chonguan.\u00a0 The judgment from which this appeal was taken was a judgment against Jose Tan Sunco, the case not having been at that time tried as to the other defendant.<br\/><br\/>The action was brought upon a promissory note signed by the two defendants dated on the 3d day of January, 1900, by which they promised to pay <i>de mancomun e insolidum<\/i> to the order of the plaintiff 6,000 pesos on the 3d day of April, 1900.\u00a0 There was nothing on the face of the note to indicate that Juan Ang Chonguan was the principal and Jose Tan Sunco his surety, but the former testified at the trial that that\u00a0 was the relation between the parties.\u00a0 The defense of Jose Tan Sunco was that he was a surety on the note; that the defendant had extended the time for the payment thereof without his knowledge and consent, and that he, therefore, had been discharged from liability thereon.\u00a0 This defense was not sustained by the court and judgment was entered in favor of the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>It is claimed by the appellee that the obligation on its face being <i>solidaria<\/i>, article 1851 of the Civil Code relied upon by the defendant is not applicable.\u00a0 We do not find it necessary to consider this question because the proof shows that whatever agreement was made in regard to interest, was made with the knowledge and consent of Jose Tan Sunco.<br\/><br\/>The mere failure of the plaintiff to collect the debt at its maturity did not constitute an extension of the time, for its payment, nor did the payment of interest, such payments not having been made in advance.\u00a0 (Banco Espa\u00f1ol-Filipino <i>vs<\/i>. Donaldson Sim &amp; Co., 5 Phil. Rep., 418; Sons of De la Rama <i>vs<\/i>. Benedicto, 5 Phil. Rep., 512.)<br\/><br\/>The evidence as to any agreement for the extension of time by the payment of interest is very indefinite, but whatever agreement was made was made with the knowledge and consent of this appellant, Juan M. Ang Chonguan testifying at the trial, as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Q.\u00a0 Are you sure that the surely Tan Sunco knew that you had asked the plaintiff not to insist on the payment of this note as long as you paid the interest?-A.\u00a0 Yes, sir; and my <i>compadre<\/i> or <i>padrino<\/i> agreed to it.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 This was done without the knowledge of the defendant Tan Sunco, was it not?-A. No, sir.\u00a0 It was with his knowledge and consent.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>This appellant did not testify in the case and there was no evidence to contradict the testimony above given.\u00a0 Whatever agreement was made, having been made therefore with the knowledge and consent of the surety, article 1851 is not applicable.<br\/><br\/>After the decision of the court below had been filed, a motion for a new trial made and denied and excepted to, the defendant made a motion in which he stated that the testimony of the witness Ang Chonguan had not been correctly taken by the stenographer; that, instead of saying that the agreement in question was with the knowledge and consent of the defendant Tan Sunco, he in fact said that it was without his knowledge or consent, and he asked that the defendant Ang Chonguan be called and allowed to testify again.\u00a0\u00a0 The court, after considering an affidavit presented by Ang Chonguan, which confirmed the statement made in the motion, and an affidavit of the stenographer in which he stated that he had correctly taken down the answer as interpreted, the court denied the motion.\u00a0 This denial is assigned as error in this court.\u00a0 In our opinion the assignment can not be sustained.\u00a0 It will be observed that the appellant did not claim that there was any error in the first answer which has been quoted above, wherein the witness stated that he was sure that Tan Sunco knew of his agreement with the plaintiff.\u00a0 We are satisfied, as the court was, that the testimony was taken down by the stenographer as it was given by the witness.<br\/><br\/>It is also said by the appellant that an agreement was made in 1904 between the plaintiff and Ang Chonguan by virtue of which the note was to be paid in installments and Ang Chonguan testified that he received such a proposition and accepted it, but did not carry it out.\u00a0 The court found that no such agreement was made, and we can not say that the evidence preponderates against that finding.\u00a0 The fact that Ang Chonguan continued paying interest after his alleged acceptance of this offer in the same way that he had been doing before is very strong evidence to show that no<br\/>contract was made by which he was to pay in installments of 1,000 pesos.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below is affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

that a certified copy of the deed of transfer be also sent to the registrar of property in compliance with law; that the fees of the commissioners appointed by the court be charged in equal parts to both inheritances, and that the bond given by the executrix be canceled.<br\/><br\/>From said decision the latter appealed, and after giving bond for P500 her appeal was admitted\u00a0 and forwarded to this court.<br\/><br\/>All debts that might be outstanding against the estate of the late Enrique Borjal having been held to be barred by reason of their not being presented for collection within the period fixed for the purpose by the duly appointed commissioners, the question at issue and presented to this court is whether the clause which provided for the retention by the widow of the property which the deceased willed to his sister, Dolores Borjal, may be considered as set aside, and the usufruct of the said property bequeathed to his widow, Ambrosia Postigo, for the period of four years from the death of the testator for the purpose of meeting the debts of the estate particularly that owing to Domingo Monasterio, should be considered as having terminated.<br\/><br\/>A rule that is uniformly laid down by the courts is, that the will of the testator is the primary and principal law governing\u00a0 wills and testaments, and when the testamentary provisions are clearly and positively stated, questions arising in the courts in connection with the execution of and compliance therewith shall be adjusted in harmony with the plain and literal meaning of the language of the testator, except where it clearly appears that his intention was other than that actually expressed.\u00a0 (Decisions of the supreme court of Spain of May 24, 1882: October 13, 1896; October 8, 1902.)<br\/><br\/>The above legal doctrine already constitutes a uniform settled rule and is in accord with the conclusive provision of article\u00a0 675 of the Civil Code which reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"Every testamentary provision shall be understood in the literal meaning of its words, unless it clearly appears that the will of the testator was different.\u00a0 In case of doubt, that which appears most in accordance with the intention of the testator, according to the tenor of the same will, shall be observed.\" <\/blockquote> Section 640 of the Code of Civil Procedure\u00a0 provides, among other things, that after payment of the debts and of the expenses of administration, the property of the testator shall be disposed of according to his will; and section 643 of said code when enumerating the duties of an executor states that one of them is to administer all property coming into his possession according to the will of the testator.<br\/><br\/>The testator bequeathed to his widow the usufruct of two parcels of land for the period of four years, in order that she might meet the debts of her husband.\u00a0 Consequently, the circumstance that outstanding debts of the said estate were declared to be barred, owing to the failure of the various creditors and especially of the one named in the will, to appear within the time specified by the commissioners, is no valid reason for shortening the period fixed in the will within which the usufruct should accrue to the widow and executrix.\u00a0 The barring of the debts of the estate can not effect a modification of the will, nor cause the testamentary provision of the testator to be interpreted as meaning anything but that stated in his will.<br\/><br\/>Clearly and precisely the testator provided as his last will that his said wife should administer the said parcels of land for four years, in order that she might pay his debts.\u00a0 The fact that no creditor ever appeared to collect them is no reason why the widow and executrix should be deprived of the usufruct of said properties before the lapse of the said four years.\u00a0 Such deprivation would be in violation of the special law that governs the matter, that is, the will of the testator, by which his property must be administered, according to the legal provisions and settled rules hereinbefore cited.<br\/><br\/>The validity and efficiency of the usufruct bequeathed to the widow and executrix of the testator is not incompatible with the provisions of section 695 of the Code of Civil Procedure, because apart from the obligation imposed by the testator upon his wife in the matter of the payment of his debts, which obligation she was unable to fulfill inasmuch as no creditor presented himself, there\u00a0 exists the order or request that she should retain the said lands in her possession for four years, and there is no valid reason why the will of the testator should not be complied with, and the land be delivered to Dolores Borjal at the expiration of said four years.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, in view of the foregoing, it is our opinion that the judgment appealed from should be reversed, and that it be\u00a0 held, as we do hereby hold, that Ambrosia Postigo is entitled to possession and to administer for the period of four years, from the death of the testator, the two parcels of land, and that Dolores Borjal can not take possession thereof until after the lapse of the said term.\u00a0 No special ruling is made as to the costs in either instance.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

that on a certain day in the said month (the date not being stated) the so-called heirs of the late Mariano de la Cruz appeared as third parties claiming the ownership of the property, and on the 15th, the plaintiff administrators also claimed in legal form the engine and the carabaos levied upon.\u00a0 The two claims were admitted by the said sheriff without a bond being given by the attaching creditor before the 17th, the day fixed for the sale, and it was only on the 18th, the following day, that a bond was given in the sum of P2,000; that the said sheriff did not take into account that the bond given did not state to which of the claims it referred, nor the insufficiency of the same for any of the claims, as well as of the fact that it was given out of time; that the plaintiffs called his attention in due course to all of these facts, but notwithstanding this notice he continues to retain the attached property and has again advertised the sale of the same for the 27th of said month; that if the sale of the property claimed by the plaintiffs is carried out without a sufficient bond being given with reference to their claim as provided by section 451 of Act No. 190, the interests of the intestate estates administered by the plaintiffs will be greatly prejudiced, because the steam engine is worth more than P3,500 and the 20 carabaos at the rate of P150 each, the current price per head, make up the sum of P3,000, while the undetermined bond accepted by the sheriff amounts to P2,000 only; and that if it is not possible to issue a writ of mandamus before the 27th of said month, or in case the\u00a0 sheriff does not\u00a0 obey it, the only legal remedy to avoid the continuation of such acts and the consequent prejudice as shown, is to enjoin every act tending to effect the said sale during the pendency of these proceedings, and a preliminary injunction should be issued against the sheriff and the defendants or their agents, upon a bond being given as offered by the representative of the plaintiffs.\u00a0 To this end he requests that a preliminary injunction be issued to the said sheriff ordering him to release the said property on account of the lack of sufficient bond, and to expressly consider the claim of the plaintiffs; and that, in addition, a preliminary injunction be issued against the sheriff himself, the defendant, his agents or assistants, as alleged in paragraphs 7 and 8 of his complaint, together with any other equitable relief.<br\/><br\/>On the 14th of November, 1907, upon a bond for P4,000 being given, the court granted a preliminary injunction and the writ was issued on the 16th of the said month.<br\/><br\/>On the 20th of the said month of November, the defendants demurred to the complaint alleging that the plaintiffs were without capacity to sue.<br\/><br\/>In answer to the complaint the defendants offered a general and special denial of each and every allegation contained in the complaint, and as a special defense alleged that the defendant had furnished bond in the sum of P4,000 in order to proceed with the sale of the attached property of Simona Dizon and to answer for any loss or damage caused to third persons, and that the facts alleged in the complaint do not constitute a cause of action in favor of the plaintiffs as against the defendants.<br\/><br\/>As a counterclaim the defendant, Dolores Lumbera, alleged that the suspension of the sale of the steam engine would cause her a loss Of P2 per day, and that of the carabaos P10 per day, for which reason the defendants prayed the court to hold trial of the case as soon as possible, and that judgment be entered in due course absolving the defendants of the complaint; that the preliminary injunction be dissolved, and that the defendant Dolores Lumbera be allowed an indemnity of P12 per day for the losses suffered by her, to be paid by the plaintiffs with costs.<br\/><br\/>On the 18th of January, 1908, the court below ordered the demurrer offered by the defendants to be set aside for the reason that the defendants had answered the complaint.<br\/><br\/>On the 24th of March, 1908, the trial judge entered his decision in the case and ordered:\u00a0 That the preliminary injunction be dissolved; that the deputy sheriff proceed to sell the attached property of Simona Dizon, both real and personal, at 10 a. m. on April 28,1908; that the said property, or so much thereof as should be necessary, be sold in order to pay the amount of the execution costs and expenses together with interest on the debt until the date when the said preliminary injunction was issued; and that the plaintiffs pay the interest on the amount due from the date of the preliminary injunction until the sale of the attached property is made together with the costs.\u00a0 A writ of execution was issued for the said amounts.<br\/><br\/>The representative of the plaintiffs, upon being informed of the foregoing decision, excepted thereto, and on the 26th of March presented a motion setting forth that the trial of the case, which had been set for the 20th, was postponed to the 27th at his request (of the attorney for the plaintiffs), and that for said reason the plaintiffs failed to appear on the said 20th day, and because the decision was contrary to law.<br\/><br\/>By an order of the 6th of April, the court below in view of the above motion fixed the date for the hearing of the matter for the 15th of said month.\u00a0 The hearing took place, and on the same day the court below overruled the motion for new trial for reasons which it stated in its decision.\u00a0 From said decision the attorney for the plaintiffs excepted and announced in writing his intention to submit a bill of exceptions in order to appeal to the Supreme Court.<br\/><br\/>On the 20th of April, the representative of the plaintiffs filed a new motion praying the court below to reconsider several decisions entered in this case, and to modify them in accordance with its merits in order to protect the interest of the plaintiffs.\u00a0 The motion was overruled, the plaintiffs excepted and the bill of exceptions was thereupon submitted, but without the evidence adduced during the course of the proceedings, inasmuch as the documents exhibited and connected with the decision appealed from have not been attached thereto.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding the fact that one of the documents, which, according to the said decision, was exhibited by the defendants, states that the plaintiffs claimed, as third parties, on account of the attachment, yet, it does not appear that an intervention was presented claiming the ownership of the attached property, or preference for collecting the value thereof.\u00a0 What the representative of the plaintiffs has done is to avail himself of the special remedy of mandamus to defend his rights, in accordance with the provisions of Section 222 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br\/><br\/>Besides asking in his complaint that a preliminary injunction be issued, he asked that a writ of mandamus be issued to the sheriff ordering him to release the said property on account of the lack of sufficient bond, and to refer expressly to the claim of the plaintiffs.\u00a0 Such is the principal petition filed by the representative of the plaintiffs, which was to be the subject of decision in this matter.<br\/><br\/>It is alleged by the said representative that the steam engine and the 20 carabaos which were attached, formed part of the property of the intestate estate administered by the plaintiffs, but said allegation and the simple claim and protest presented to the sheriff are not sufficient to enable the said principal petition\u00a0 for the special remedy to prosper before the courts of justice.\u00a0 It becomes necessary to show and prove the reason or the right upon which they rely as third parties whose prejudice it was intended to avoid.<br\/><br\/>Although in connection with attachment proceedings, the sheriff, under the Code of Civil Procedure, may use his discretion, and is personally responsible if he fails to listen to a claim based on and in accord with the law thereby causing prejudice to a third person, responsibility which shall be shared by the party who applied for the attachment in case he has given a bond securing the officer who carries out the levy; however, it is indispensable that such third party shall exercise his right in accordance with the law, and fulfill the formalities and conditions prescribed by it in order that he may be granted the protection which he justly deserves.\u00a0 (Secs. 442 and 451, Code of Civil Procedure.)<br\/><br\/>The representative of the plaintiffs has preferred to exercise the special remedy of mandamus, alleging that if the sale of the said property was carried out without a sufficient bond, great\u00a0 prejudice would be inflicted to the interests of the said intestate successors; therefore, it was incumbent upon him to establish the basis for his application in order to ask for such remedy, as well as the right of the plaintiffs to the property levied upon.\u00a0 This he has not done.<br\/><br\/>In the judgment appealed from the court below says:\u00a0 \"In view of the fact that the plaintiffs and their attorney have offered no satisfactory reason for the suspension of the proceedings and have not proven the complaint,\" and by a subsequent ruling of the 6th of April it adds that the evidence adduced by the representative of the plaintiffs in support of the motion for the reconsideration of the matter has not convinced the court that the same was well founded, but, for the purpose of protecting the interests of the parties and to administer justice, it appointed the 15th of April for the new hearing of the matter; but since the petitioner had not alleged any reason in support of his motion, the same was denied with costs.\u00a0 From all of the foregoing it has been demonstrated that the plaintiffs have not alleged any reason nor established any right by which they might invoke the said special remedy, because it has not been proved that they were the owners of the property levied upon, nor that they had a preferential right to the value thereof.<br\/><br\/>In order that the said remedy may lie, and that the court below may issue a decisive order against the said defendant sheriff and other defendants, it is necessary to prove that they have failed to perform a function which the law specially prescribes as a duty attached to the office of sheriff, and that the defendants unlawfully prevented the plaintiffs from the use and enjoyment of a right that belongs to them.\u00a0 It does not appear in, the case that the representative of the plaintiffs has complied with this duty, as stated in the decision appealed from and in the previous decisions entered in the case.<br\/><br\/>It should be noted that as the evidence has not been submitted with the case it is not proper to enter the question as to whether or not the decision appealed from is supported by the result thereof.\u00a0 The judgment\u00a0 as rendered must be accepted as to the facts.<br\/><br\/>As to the right to ask for a preliminary injunction, or a writ of prohibition, it must be known that the said remedy may be sought by any person who, by reason of an attachment, has presented or interposed a plea for intervention; and that when the claim for intervention has been finally denied, it is proper to\u00a0 forthwith grant the dissolution or release of the said preliminary injunction, inasmuch as said remedy can not be sustained after the intervention, which is the principal complaint upon which the said injunction depends, has been overruled and dismissed.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the provision of the judgment appealed from that the deputy sheriff shall proceed to sell the real and personal property at the hour and day therein appointed, in order to pay the amount of the execution together with the costs and expenses and the legal interest until the day the preliminary injunction was issued, such a decision should be rendered by the judge who ordered the attachment and sale of the said property, for the reason that, after the preliminary injunction was vacated and upon release of the prohibition that prevented the sheriff from carrying out the execution ordered by the justice of the peace of Mabalacat, the authority and jurisdiction of the latter again became effective, and the deputy sheriff was thereby enabled to discharge his duties.\u00a0 After the preliminary injunction was dissolved, the judge of first instance, who issued it on account of a petition of mandamus, is not permitted to interfere in the enforcement of a judgment of the justice of the peace.<br\/><br\/>For the reasons stated above, it is proper that the plaintiffs be held liable for the interest on the amount owed by Simona Dizon from the time when the sale was withheld by virtue of the said injunction until the property levied upon is sold, and for the costs of these proceedings.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, in view of the considerations set forth it is held:\u00a0 That the complaint interposed by the representative of the administrators of the intestate estates of Miguel Puig and Andres Safont must be dismissed, and that the mandamus asked for must be denied.\u00a0 The first issue of the judgment appealed from vacating the preliminary injunction is hereby affirmed.\u00a0 It is further held, that the plaintiffs are responsible for legal interest on the amount of the debt claimed from Simona Dizon since the suspension of the execution of the judgment entered by the justice of the peace of Mabalacat with the property levied upon until the sale thereof by the deputy sheriff, and for said reason they must pay the same with the costs of both instances.\u00a0 The second issue of the judgment appealed from is set aside as to the sale of the said property at the hour and\u00a0 day appointed therein.\u00a0 The judgment appealed from is thus affirmed as far as it agrees with this decision.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Fitzgerald,\u00a0 deputy of the provincial treasurer, went to the office of the accused, who was at the time the municipal treasurer of Polo and deputy of the provincial treasurer of Bulaean at the same town, to inspect the accounts of the municipal treasury.\u00a0 The accused, Teodoro E. Santos, on being asked whether he had on hand all the money in his charge, replied in the affirmative, saying that the sum of P300 belonging to said treasury was in the hands of Pio Valenzuela for the purposes of exchange and taking up money of the old coinage.\u00a0 The said money was at once recovered from Valenzuela's possession by order of the accused, through one Procopio Espiritu.<br\/><br\/>After checking the accounts of the municipal treasury, it was noticed that there was a shortage of P52.93, which amount the treasurer stated was in the hands of Gualberto Santos, also for exchange, less P2.93, which difference he supposed was due to some error in the accounts, the balance of P50 having been refunded on the following day, the 31st.\u00a0 When the defendant's accounts were carefully examined a few days afterwards, on checking the said accounts with the money found in the safe, including the above sums of P300 and P50, there still appeared to be a shortage of P15.85.<br\/><br\/>It was proven that, prior to the dates above referred to, the district auditor, Mr. Richmond, on being informed that the accused had delivered P600 to Pio Valenzuela to be exchanged for Philippine coins of the old issue, advised the accused through Vicente Tagle, that he should never withdraw funds from the municipal safe under any consideration; the accused was also advised by the provincial treasurer, Mr. Goodhart, who likewise learned that the accused had delivered $40, gold, belonging to the municipality, to a friend of his, that, should he do so again, he would be taken before the courts.\u00a0 The accused alleged that, in compliance with circular orders received from his superiors he was endeavoring to collect a larger amount of coins of the old issue by means of exchange.<br\/><br\/>A complaint having been filed for the above reasons and the proper proceedings\u00a0 instituted, the trial court, on January 28, 1908, sentenced the accused Teodoro E. Santos to the penalty of fourteen months of <i>prision correccional<\/i>, to suspension for three years from all public office, right of suffrage, profession or office, to pay a fine of 10 per cent of the amount of P365.85, to refund P15.85 to the treasury, and to pay the costs.\u00a0 From this judgment the accused has appealed, his motion for a new trial having been denied.<br\/><br\/>It does not satisfactorily appear from the record that funds belonging to the municipal treasury of the pueblo of Polo, Bulacan, have been misappropriated or abstracted to the prejudice of the public interests.\u00a0 The sum of f350 was taken from the said treasury to be exchanged for coins of the old issue, the collection of which had been ordered in compliance with the purpose of the administration, as shown by the evidence.<br\/><br\/>Therefore the accused disposed of the money, not for the purpose of benefiting himself or applying the same to other than its proper object, but with the lawful intent to facilitate the execution of an administrative measure; that is, the withdrawal of coins of the old issue, it being immaterial whether the withdrawal was effected by means of coins of the new issue or by notes.<br\/><br\/>But disregarding the said P350, the accused Santos, has been charged with the misappropriation of the sum of P15.85, and the evidence offered in the case is not conclusive or satisfactory as to such misappropriation.<br\/><br\/>The examination of the safe and accounts of the funds intrusted to the accused took place in the laser's presence, on July 30, a shortage of P352.93 was found, and, deducting from the said amount the above-mentioned P350, the difference of P2.93 was charged to some error in accounting; but, on making a new revision of accounts a few days later, in the absence of the accused treasurer, a larger shortage\u00a0 appeared-that is, the sum of P15.85.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The accused having been informed of this, requested the deputy of the provincial treasurer, Mr. Fitzgerald, to again check up the accounts in his presence; this the deputy refused to do, notwithstanding ,the former's statement that he was ready to refund any shortage that might appear.\u00a0 It is further set forth by the accused that the provincial treasury was still indebted to him for his salary of July, i. e., P26.66.<br\/><br\/>Under such circumstances, this court can only accept the report of July 30, showing the result of the examination and revision of accounts made in the presence of the accused; this evidenced a shortage of P352,93, which amount the responsible treasurer accounted for; but the report of August 5 can not be accepted for the reason that the accused was not present when the accounts to which it refers were inspected, nor does it appear that he agreed to the result; the previous liquidation referred to in the said report of July 30, has not been shown to be incorrect, so that the later report of August 5 could be admitted against the former.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, as the evidence in support of the charges made by the prosecution does not prove the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt, he must be acquitted, inasmuch as the presumption of innocence exists in his favor unless the contrary is duly proven.<br\/><br\/>For the reasons above set forth, we are of the opinion that the accused Teodoro E.

Cayetano Bastes to collect and receive the amount loaned by the said Bastes to the municipal president and treasurer of Sevilla in the year 1903.\u00a0 Adlaon also, with reckless negligence, failed to tell the truth in stating the facts contained in the said document.\u00a0 He said therein that he had received the money, when in reality neither was the money paid for the work done by the carpenters, nor was it received by him.<br\/><br\/>In view of the above a complaint was filed by the provincial fiscal charging said two individuals with the crime of falsification of a public document by reason of reckless negligence.\u00a0 Counsel for the the accused demurred to the complaint, alleging that the facts therein complained of did not constitute a crime; that the complaint was not drawn according to law, and that if the facts mentioned constituted a crime, the result would be that two crimes were charged under the same complaint.<br\/><br\/>On the 7th of October, the court below; after hearing both parties, sustained the demurrer on the ground that the facts did not constitute the crime complained of, as in the opinion of the trial judge there neither exists, nor can there exist, any such crime as falsification of a public document by reason of reckless negligence.\u00a0 From his decision the fiscal has appealed.<br\/><br\/>Between an act performed voluntarily and intentionally, and another committed unconsciously and quite unintentionally, there exists another, performed without malice, but at the same time punishable, though in a lesser degree and with an equal material result; an intermediate act which the Penal Code qualifies as negligence, or reckless negligence.<br\/><br\/>A man must use common sense, and exercise due reflection in all his acts; it is his duty to be cautious, careful, and prudent, if not from instinct, then through fear of incurring punishment.\u00a0 He is responsible for such results as anyone might foresee and for acts which no one would have performed except through culpable abandon.\u00a0 Otherwise his own person, rights and property, and those of his fellow-beings, would ever be exposed to all manner of danger and injury.<br\/><br\/>On the above theory, which is a perfectly just one, article 568 of the Penal Code reads:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"He who shall execute through reckless negligence an act that, if done with malice, would constitute a grave crime, shall be punished with the penalty of <i>arresto mayor<\/i> in its maximum degree to <i>prision correccional<\/i> in its minimum degree, and with <i>arresto mayor<\/i> in its minimum and medium degrees if it shall constitute a less grave crime.<br\/><br\/>\"He who in violation of the regulations shall commit a crime through simple imprudence or negligence shall incur the penalty of <i>arresto mayor<\/i> in its medium and maximum degrees.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>Therefore, any act executed without malice or criminal intent, but with lack of foresight, carelessness, or negligence, and which has harmed society or an individual, deserves the qualification of either reckless or simple negligence or imprudence.\u00a0 The penalty, in the practical application of the\u00a0 above-quoted article, depends upon the relative seriousness of the crime and whether malice or criminal intent is present; the denomination or qualification is according to the circumstances of the case and nature of the act, such as homicide by reckless negligence, infidelity in the custody of prisoners through imprudence, falsification of documents by reason of reckless negligence, etc.<br\/><br\/>The courts which have heretofore dealt with and tried acts punishable under the Penal Code of Spain, which is almost the same as the one now in force in these Islands, have tried several cases of falsification of documents by reckless negligence.\u00a0 To these the provisions of article 581 of the Penal Code, identical with article 568 above cited, have been applied, as may be seen, among others, from the judgments in cassation of July 8, 1882; December 21, 1885; November 8, 1887; and December 7, 1896.\u00a0 See also the case of The United States <i>vs.<\/i> Mariano Vega, No. 2818 of the general register of this court.<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup><br\/><br\/>For the considerations above set forth, and which relate solely to the reasons on which is based the order appealed from, and considering that the classification of falsification of documents by reason of reckless negligence is perfectly legal, considering the nature and circumstances surrounding the act which is the subject of the complaint, it is our opinion that the said order should be reversed.\u00a0 Let the case be remanded to the court whence\u00a0 it came with a certified copy of this decision, and let the judge\u00a0 below proceed with the case and enter judgment therein in accordance with the law.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Smith, Bell &amp; Co., 8 Phil. Rep., 496; Boncan <i>vs<\/i>. Smith, Bell &amp; Co., 9 Phil. Rep., 109.)<br\/><br\/>It is the general rule that, when a person by virtue of a judgment for the recovery of a debt secures an attachment against property which turns out to have been previously sold, although the purchaser did not have the property properly registered in his name, the latter has the superior right as the attachment does not confer a real right.\u00a0 (Galindo and Escosura on the Mortgage Law, vol. 2, p. 630.)<br\/><br\/>Upon the second assignment of error there was but little proof introduced.\u00a0 The property seems to be of but little value.\u00a0 The defendant swore\u00a0 that the rental value of said property was 15 pesos per\u00a0 month.\u00a0 The proof adduced during the trial on the question of damages seems to be inadequate to justify any definite conclusion about the real value of the property involved.\u00a0 However, inasmuch as the lower court has found that the rental value of said property was 15 pesos per month, we do not feel justified in changing that finding of fact.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the third assignment of error, no argument has been presented by the plaintiff sufficient to justify this court in changing the order of the lower court.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, and for the reasons above stated, the judgment of the lower court is hereby affirmed, with costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.
