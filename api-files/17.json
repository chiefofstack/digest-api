COSME JUARES ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.\n  <br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>CARSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\"><p>The  appellants were convicted of the crime  of homicide by the Court of First Instance of the Province of Cebu.<\/p>\n<p>The information  upon which this prosecution is based charges  Cosme  Juares, Fernando Juares, Crispin  Juares, Mariano Empalmado, Juan Caramugan, Pedro Juares, and Valentin Juares with having inflicted serious wounds upon the person  of one  Saturnino  Lapas,  from  the effects  of which  he died.   One of the  defendants, Mariano  Empalmado, was not before the court, and another, Cosme Juares, was acquitted.  This appeal  is now presented by the other five defendants, who were convicted in the court below.<\/p>\n<p>It appears that on the 28th day of  September,  1909, a fiesta was celebrated in the barrio of Calignan, in the municipality of Carcar, Province of Cebu.  In the late afternoon of the day of the fiesta, Lapas, a man of rather violent character, was in a  state of intoxication, going about the village in a  boisterous and unruly manner,  disturbing and abusing the people who  were in attendance on the fiesta. He was especially troublesome to the tenderas, interfering with them in the conduct of their business.  Crisanto Tangaro, <em>teniente<\/em> of the barrio of Calignan, took him  to task and reprimanded him for his bad  conduct.  Hardly had Tangaro gone away  before Lapas engaged in a fresh altercation with  Cosme Juares, who was endeavoring to take from him a  rather dangerous club which he was carrying. Cosme  Juares, who was a <em>teniente<\/em> of an adjoining barrio,       called upon the other defendants herein, his relatives and subordinates, to come to his aid and not to leave him  alone in his efforts to get possession of the club.  They responded, and a general disturbance followed, in which quite a number of persons took part.  Lapas received several slight wounds and registered  a complaint with the <em>teniente <\/em>of the barrio of Calignan, Crisanto Tangaro, against one Francisco Gellido, alias Butong.  The <em>teniente<\/em> determined to take both Lapas and  Butong before  the  proper authorities  of the village in order that an investigation might be made of the charges.  At this point the defendant Juan Caramugan, who had gone away at the beginning of the altercation between Cosme Juares  and Lapas,  returned armed with a <em>pinuti<\/em> (a bolo or long knife), and  upon seeing Lapas  approached him in a threatening attitude.  Lapas apparently became frightened and attempted to make his escape.   Juan Caramugan was disarmed, and about the same time Lapas broke away and was  followed by Mariano  Empalmado,  armed with a pinuti, Fernando Juares, also armed with the <em>pinuti<\/em> which had been  taken away from  Juan Caramugan, and by  Crispin Juares, who, though unarmed, was throwing stones and taking an  active part in the pursuit.  These three defendants were presently joined  by Pedro Juares and Valentin Juares, who likewise threw stones at the fleeing Lapas.  The deceased was  last seen alive  endeavoring to make his escape from thes.e five defendants in the growing darkness of the night  The dead body of Lapas was found on the following day in a near-by field, covered with cuts, wounds, and bruises of various kinds.<\/p>\n<p>Juan Caramugan took no  part in the pursuit, and  does not appear to have been present when the death of Saturnino Lapas took place.   It is true that while  the deceased was being held in custody he approached him in  a threatening attitude and apparently was the first to make the movement against the deceased which doubtless resulted  in the deceased's breaking arrest and  taking to flight.  The court below was of opinion that  Caramugan was the leader in the disturbance which resulted in the death of the deceased, and was of opinion that the fact that he did not join the pursuit did not relieve him of criminal responsibility.   The record however does not disclose any evidence of conspiracy to take the life  of the deceased prior to the time  when the party pursued him into the  fields after he had broken his arrest.   There is nothing whatever in the record to show that Caramugan had any reason to believe or to anticipate that the defendants, who actually pursued Lapas, would do him to death when they caught up  with him.   We are of opinion, therefore, that  the judgment of conviction should not be sustained as to him.<\/p>\n<p>There were no witnesses present when the deceased  was actually done to death,  but there can be  no reasonable doubt that he came to his death at the hands of the party which pursued him after he broke his arrest.  There may have been  others who also took a part in this tragic affair, and who may even have been more active participants than these defendants and appellants, but this in no wise relieves the appellants of their responsibility.   We hold that there is no reasonable doubt as to their  guilt.<\/p>\n<p>We agree with the trial judge, however, that the evidence discloses no aggravating circumstances, and that the provisions  of  article 11  [Penal Code] should  be taken into consideration  under all  the  circumstances of this case in extenuation of the guilt of  the accused, and further that the conduct of the deceased, which provoked and brought on the quarrel or disturbance  which  resulted in his  death should also be taken  into consideration as  an  additional extenuating circumstance.<\/p>\n<p>With reference to Valentin Juares, a further mitigating circumstance was taken into  consideration  by  the  court below, in that he was  under 18 years of age, and appears to have been acting under the belief that he was obeying the orders  of a superior officer.  The trial judge sentenced this defendant to two years four months and one day of <em>prision  correccional.<\/em>  The other appellants were each sentenced to twelve years and one day of <em>reclusion temporal<\/em>, and to the payment of one seventh of the costs of the action, and to indemnify jointly  and severally the heirs  of  the deceased in the sum of one thousand pesos.<\/p>\n<p>It appears that Valentin Juares was  under 18 years of age and over 15.  Section 2 of article 85 of the Penal Code provides that \"the penalty next lower than that prescribed by law\" is to be applied in its proper degree in such cases. This penalty in the  present case is  <em>prision mayor<\/em> in its minimum degree.<\/p>\n<p>There is evidence in the record  which tends to disclose that in intervening  in the disturbance  which resulted  in the arrest of the deceased  and in the attempt to  recapture him when he broke from  arrest, all  of the convicts were acting  under the orders of the  <em>teniente<\/em> of  their barrio, and believed that it was their duty to obey those orders; but  it is very  clear that no such orders could justify or excuse their conduct  in  doing the unarmed man  to  death, while he was attempting to escape from the scene  of the disturbance.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment of conviction and the sentence of the trial court in so far as Juan Caramugan is affected thereby should be and  is hereby reversed,  and he  is acquitted of the crime with which he is charged, with his share  of the costs in both instances <em>de oficio.<\/em>  He will therefore  be  set at liberty forthwith. So much of the sentence as imposes upon the defendant Valentin Juares the penalty of two years four months and one  day of  <em>prision correccional<\/em>  should  be  and is hereby modified by substituting in  lieu thereof the penalty  of six years and one day of  <em>prision mayor,<\/em> and thus modified the judgment  of conviction and the sentence imposed upon  all the appellants  except  Juan Caramugan is  affirmed, with their respective  shares of the costs of this instance against them.  So ordered.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres,  Mapa, Johnson,  Moreland,<\/em> and <em>Trent,  JJ.,<\/em> concur.<br\/>\n<\/p>\n<\/div>",

After hearing the evidence, the lower court prohibited the sale as prayed for by the plaintiff and directed the  sheriff  to return  the  property  to  the plaintiff, with costs against the defendants.<\/p>\n<p>The facts as gathered  from the record seem to be as follows:<\/p>\n<p>First. That on the 15th day of May, 1908, a justice of the peace of the municipality of Saravia, rendered a decision against the  said Antonio Decena and  in favor of the estate of  Magdaleno Jimenea.  Later, on the 17th  day of July, 1908, the Court of First Instance of the Province of Occidental Negros declared said decision null and void.<\/p>\n<p>Second. On the 18th of August, 1908, Felix Montinola, as administrator of the said estate of Jimenea, commenced an action in the Court of First Instance of Occidental Negros against Antonio Decena, based upon  the same grounds as the action theretofore  commenced in  the court of the said justice of the peace.  After hearing the evidence, the court, on the 26th of January, 1909, rendered a decision in favor of the estate of the said Jimenea and agamst Antonio Decena, for the sum of P600.<\/p>\n<p>Third. On the 23d day of April, 1909, an execution was issued upon said judgment in favor of the estate of Jimenea and against the property of Antonio Decena.  Under said execution the property in question was attached.<\/p>\n<p>Fourth.  On the 1st day of July,  1908, Antonio Decena sold and delivered the property in question, under a public document,  to Cristeto de Leon.  The deed of sale between Antonio Decena  and Cristeto  de  Leon was  presented  in evidence during the trial of the cause  in the court below. The said deed was registered in the registry of property on the 4th day of August, 1908.<\/p>\n<p>Fifth. On the 13th day of August, 1908, Cristeto de Leon, by virtue of a public document,  sold and transferred the property in question to the said Benito Decena.  This deed of transfer was also duly registered in the registry of property on the 16th day of December, 1908.<\/p>\n<p>The defendants, during the trial of the cause in the lower court, alleged that the said deeds of transfer  of the property in  question were fraudulent and that the said Antonio Decena was still the real owner of the said lands, but no proof whatever was adduced to  support this contention. The defendants and appellants rely upon the provisions of article 1297 of the Civil Code, for the purpose of sustaining their contention that the  said conveyances were fraudulent.<\/p>\n<p>Article 1297 provides that:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"All contracts, by virtue of which a debtor conveys property under gratuitous title are presumed to be made in fraud of creditors.<\/p>\n<p>\"Conveyances  under  onerous titles,  made  by persons against whom a  condemnatory sentence,  in any instance, has been previously rendered, or a writ of seizure of property has been issued, shall also be presumed fraudulent.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>It will be noted that no proof was adduced in  the court below to show that the  said  transfers were  made under gratuitous title.   It will also be noted that at the time of the transfer of the property  in question  by Antonio Decena to Cristeto de Leon  (July  1, 1908), no valid condemnatory sentence had been rendered against Antonio  Decena, and             so far as the record shows no sentence had been rendered against him until nearly six months after the transfer of the said property had been made by de Leon to the plaintiff herein.<\/p>\n<p>There may have been fraud in the different transfers of the property in question, but the record fails to show it.   If the defendants  believed  that the  transfers were fraudulent, that fact should have been established by competent evidence.<\/p>\n<p>After a careful  consideration of the, record brought to this court, we are of the opinion that the judgment of  the lower court should be  affirmed with costs.

JOSE LAUREL ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.\n  <br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\"><p>This appeal was raised by the four above-named defendants, from the judgment of conviction, found on page 117 of the record, rendered by the Honorable Mariano Cui.<\/p>\n<p>The facts in this case are  as follows: On the  night  of December 26,1909, while the girl Concepcion Lat was walking along the street, on her way from the house of Exequiel Castillo,  situated  in the pueblo of Tanauan, Province  oi Batangas, accompanied  by several young people, she was approached by Jose Laurel who suddenly kissed her and immediately thereafter ran off in the direction of his house, pursued  by the girl's  companions, among whom was the master of the  house above mentioned, Exequiel  Castillo; but they did not overtake him.<\/p>\n<p>On the second night  after the occurrence just  related, that is, on the 28th, while Exequiel Castillo and Jose Laurel, together  with Domingo  Panganiban and several others  of the defendants, were at an entertainment held on an upper floor of the parochial  building of the said  pueblo and attended by  many residents of the town, it  is alleged that the said  Castillo and Laurel were invited by Panganiban, the former through his brother, Roque Castillo,  and the latter, directly, to come  out into the yard, which they did, accompanied by Panganiban  and  the other  defendants referred  to.  After the  exchange of a  few  words and explanations  concerning  the kiss  given the girl Lat on the night of  the 26th of that month, a quarrel arose between the said Jose Laurel and Exequiel Castillo, in which Domingo Panganiban, Vicente Garcia, and Conrado Laurel took part, and as a result of the quarrel Exequiel Castillo was seriously wounded.  He succeeded in reaching a drug store near by where  he  received first  aid treatment;  Jose  Laurel  also received two slight wounds on the head.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Sixto Rojas, who be\u00a3an  to render medical assistance to Exequiel Castillo early in the morning of the following day, stated that his examination of the iatter's injuries disclosed a wound in the left side of the chest, on a level with the fourth rib, from 3 to 4 centimeters  in depth, reaching into the lung; another wound  in the back of the left  arm and in  the conduit through which the ulnar nerve passes, frpm 10 to 11 centimeters in length, penetrating to the bone and injuring the  nerves  and arteries of the said  region, especially the ulnar nerve, which was severed; a contusion on  the  right  temple,  accompanied by ecchymosis  and hemorrhage of the tissues of the eye; and, finally, another contusion in  the back of the abdomen near the left cavity, which by reaction injured the stomach and the right cavity. According  to the  opinion of the  physician above named, the wound in the left side of the breast was  serious on account of its having fully penetrated the lungs and caused the patient to spit blood, as noticed the day after he  was wounded, and there must have been a hemorrhage of the lung, an important vital vascular organ; by reason of this hemorrhage  or  general infection  the patient would  have died,  had it not been for the timely medical aid rendered him.  The wound on the back of the left arm was also of a serious  nature, as the ulnar nerve was cut, with the result that the little and ring fingers of the patient's left hand have been rendered permanently useless.  With respect to the contusion on the right temple, it could have been serious, according to  the kind of blows  received,  and the contusion on the  back of the abdomen  was  diagnosed as serious also, on account of its having caused an  injury as a result of which the wounded man complained  of severe pains in the stomach  and  left spleen.   The  said  physician  stated that he had attended  the patient for fourteen consecutive days; that the contusion on the abdomen was cured in four or five days, and that on the right temple in ten or twelve days, although this latter injury was accompanied by a considerable ecchymosis which might not disappear for about three months, the time required for  the absorption of the coagulated blood; that the  stitches in the wound of the left arm were taken out after twelve days,  and when witness ceased to attend the patient, this wound was healing up and for its complete cure would require eight or more days' time; and that the wound in the breast, for the reason that it had already healed internally and the danger of infection  had disappeared, was healing,  although still more time would be required for its  complete cure, the patient being able to continue the treatment himself, which in fact he did.<\/p>\n<p>In view of the strikingly contradictory evidence adduced by the  prosecution  and by the  defense, and  in  order to decide what were the true facts of the case we shall proceed to recite the testimony of the  party who  was seriously wounded  and of his witnesses,  and afterwards, that of his alleged assailants and  of their witnesses, in order to determine the nature of the crime,  the circumstances that concurred therein and, in turn, the responsibility of the criminal or criminals.<\/p>\n<p>Exequiel  Castillo  testified that while  he,  together with Primitivo Gonzalez, was in the hall of the parochial building of Tanauan, attending an entertainment on the night of December 28, 1909, he  was approached by his  brother, Roque  Castillo,  who told  him, on the  part of  Domingo Panganiban, that Jose Laurel  desired to speak with him and was  awaiting  him  on the ground  floor of the said building,  to give him  an explanation with  regard to  his (Laurel's) having kissed Concepci6n Lat on the night of the 26th in the  street and in the presence of the witness and other young people; that the witness, Exequiel Castillo, therefore, left the parochial building, accompanied by  his brother Roque and Primitivo Gonzalez, and  met Sofronio Velasco,  Gaudencio  Garcia,  and Alfonso  Torres,  at the street door; that  after he had waited there for half an hour,  Jose  Laurel, Conrado Laurel,  Vicente  Garcia, Jose Garcia, and Domingo Panganiban, likewise came down out of the building and Jose Laurel approached him and immediately took him aside, away from  the door of the building and the others;  that Laurel then said to him that, before making any explanations relative to the said offense against the  girl Concepcion Lat, he would ask him whether it was true  that he (the witness, Castillo) had in his possession some letters addressed by Laurel to the said girl, to  which the witness replied  that as a gentleman he was not obliged  to answer the question;  that thereupon Jose Laurel suddenly struck him a blow in the left side  of the breast with a  knife,  whereupon the  witness, feeling that he was  wounded,  struck in turn with the cane he was carrying at his assailant, who  dodged and  immediately started to run; thereupon witness received another knife thrust in the left  arm followed by a  blow in  the left side from a fist  and witness, upon turning, saw Vicente Garcia and Domingo Panganiban in the act of  again  assaulting him; just then he  was struck a blow with a cane on his right temple and,  on turning, saw  behind him  Conrado Laurel carrying a stick, and just at that moment Primitivo Gonzalez and  several policemen approached  him calling for peace; his  assailants  then left him and witness went to the neighboring drug store where  he received first aid treatment.  Witness  further  testified that he  had been courting the girl Concepcion Lat for a month; that, because his sweetheart had been kissed by Jose Laurel,  he  felt  a little resentment against  the latter,  and that since then he  had had no opportunity to speak with his  assailant until the said night of the attack.<\/p>\n<p>Roque Castillo, a witness  for the  prosecution, testified that, at the  request of Domingo Panganiban, he had suggested to his  brother, Exequiel Castillo, that the  latter should go down to the door of the  ground floor of the parochial building, where Jose Laurel  was waiting for him,         so  that the latter  might make explanations to him with regard to what had taken place on the night prior to the 26th  of  December; that Exequiel, who  was in  the  hall beside Primitivo Gonzalez, immediately upon receiving the notice sent him in  Laurel's name, got up and went down with Gonzalez and  the witness, though the latter remained at the foot of the stairs in conversation  with Virginio de Villa,  whom he found there; that,  after  a little while, witness saw Jose Laurel, Jose Garcia, Domingo Panganiban, Vicente Garcia, and Conrado Laurel  come down from the said building, and, on observing something bulging from the back  of  the latter's waist he asked  him what made that bulge, to which Laurel replied that it meant \"peace;\" witness thereupon  said to him that  if he  really  desired \"peace,\" as witness also did,  he might deliver to the latter the revolver he was carrying, and to prove that he would not make bad  use  of the weapon, Laurel might take the cartridges out  and  deliver the revolver to  witness.  This he did, the witness received  the revolver  without  the cartridges, and his fears thus allayed, the witness returned to the upper floor  to the entertainment;  but that, at the end of about half an hour, he heard  a hubbub among the people who  said that  there  was a quarrel, and  witness, suspecting that his brother  Exequiel had met with some treachery, ran down out of the house;  on reaching the ground floor he met Primitivo Gonzalez, who  had blood stains  on his arm;  that Gonzalez then informed him that Exequiel was badly  wounded; that he found his said brother in Arsenio Gonzalez' drug store; and  that his brother was no longer able to speak but  made known that he wanted to be  shriven.  Witness added that  on that same night he delivered the revolver to his father, Sixto Castillo, who corroborated this statement,<\/p>\n<p>The other witness, Primitivo Gonzalez,  corroborated the testimony given by the preceding witness, Roque  Castillo, and testified that, while he was that night attending the entertainment at the parochial building of Tanauan, in company with  Exequiel  Castillo,  the  latter received  notice from his  (Castillo's)  brother, through Domingo Panganiban, to the  effect  that Jose Laurel desired  to speak with him concerning what occurred on the night of  December 26;  that thereupon Exequiel, the latter's brother,  Roque and witness all went down out of the house, though Roque stopped on the main stairway while witness and Exequiel went on until they came to the main door  of the ground floor where they met Alfonso Torres and Gaudencio Garcia; that, after a while, Jose Laurel, Conrado Laurel, Vicente Garcia, Jose  Garcia  Aquino, and  Domingo Panganiban came up; that  when Jose Laurel  met  Exequiel Castillo he  caught the  latter by  the  hand and the  two  separated themselves from the rest and retired to a certain distance, although Vicente and Jose Garcia,  Conrado Laurel,  and Alfonso Torres  placed themselves the nearest to the  first two, Jose Laurel and Exequiel Castillo; that at this juncture witness, who was about 6 or 7 meters away from the two men last named, observed that Jose Laurel, who had had his hand in his pocket while he was talking with Exequiel, immediately drew out  a handkerchief and therewith  struck Exequiel a blow on the breast; that the latter forthwith hit his assailant, Laurel, with a cane which he  was  carrying; that Laurel, upon receiving the  blow, stepped back while Exequiel pursued him and continued to  strike him; that thereupon Vicente Garcia stabbed Exequiel, who had  his back turned toward him,  and Conrado Laurel struck  the said Exequiel a  blow on the head with a cane; that when witness approached the spot where the fight  was  going  on, several policemen appeared there and called out for peace; and  that he did not notice what Jose Garcia Aquino  and Alfonso Torres did.<\/p>\n<p>Lucio Villa, a policeman, testified that on hearing  the commotion, he went to the scene of it and jmet Jose Laurel who was coming away,  walking at an ordinary gait  and carrying a bloody  pocketknife in his hand; that witness therefore arrested him, took the weapon from  him  and conducted him  to  the municipal building;  and  that  the sergeant and another policeman, the latter being the witness's companion, took charge of the other disturbers.<\/p>\n<p>The defendant, Jose  Laurel, testified  that early in the evening of the 28th of December he went to the parochial building, in company with Diosdado Siansance and several young people, among them his cousin Baltazara Rocamora, for the purpose of attending  an  entertainment which was to be held there; that,  while sitting in  the  front row of chairs, for there were  as yet but few people,  and  while the director of the college was delivering  a discourse, he was approached  by Domingo Panganiban who told him that Exequiel Castillo wished  to speak with him, to which witness replied that he should wait a while and Panganiban thereupon went away;  that, a short time afterwards, he was also approached by Alfredo  Yatco  who gave him a similar message, and soon afterwards Felipe  Almeda came up and told him that Exequiel Castillo was waiting for him on the ground floor of the house; this being the third summons addressed to him, he arose and went down to ascertain what the said Exequiel wanted; that, when he stepped outside of the street door, he saw several persons there, among them,  Exequiel Castillo; the  latter, upon  seeing witness, suggested that  they separate  from the rest and talk in a place a short distance away; that thereupon Exequiel asked witness why he had kissed his, Exequiel's sweetheart, and on  Laurel's replying that he had  done so because  she was very fickle  and prodigal of her use of the word  \"yes\" on all occasions, Exequiel said to him that he ought not to act that way and immediately struck him a blow on the head with a cane  or  club,  which  assault  made  witness dizzy and caused him to fall to the ground in a sitting posture; that, as  witness feared that his aggressor would continue to  assault him, he took  hold of the pocketknife which he was carrying in his pocket and therewith defended himself; that he did not know whether he wounded Exequiel with the said weapon, for, when  witness arose, he noticed that he, the latter, had a wound in the right parietal region and  a  contusion in the left;  that witness  was  thereupon arrested by the policeman, Lucio Villa, and was unable to state whether  he dropped the pocketknife he carried or whether it was picked up by the said officer; that it took more than a week to cure his injuries; that he had been courting the girl  Concepcion Lat for a year, but that in October, 1909,  his courtship ended  and Exequiel  Castillo then began to court her; and that, as witness believed that the said girl would not marry him, nor Exequiel, he kissed her in the street,  on the night of December  26, 1909,  and immediately thereafter ran toward his house.<\/p>\n<p>Baltazara Rocamora  stated  that,  while she  was  with Jose Laurel on the night of December 28,  1909, attending an entertainment in the parochial building of Tanauan, the latter was successively called by Domingo Panganiban, Alfredo Yatco, and  Felipe Almeda, the last named  saying: \"Go  along;  old fellow;  you  are friends now.\"  Casimiro Tapia testified  that, on  the morning  following  the  alleged crime, he visited Jose Laurel in the jail,  and  found him suffering from two bruises or contusions; that to cure them, he gave him one application of tincture of arnica to apply to his injuries,  which were not serious.<\/p>\n<p>Benito Valencia also testified that, while at the entertainment, he saw Domingo  Panganiban  approach Jose  Laurel and tell him that Exequiel  Castillo  was waiting for him downstairs to talk to him; that Laurel refused to go, as he wished to be present at the entertainment, and that Panganiban then went away; that,  soon afterwards, witness also went down, intending to return home, and, when he had been oh the ground  floor of  the parochial  building  for  fifteen minutes, he saw,  among  the many people who were there, Exequiel  Castillo  and  Jose  Laurel  who  were  talking apart from a group of persons among whom he recognized Roque  Castillo, Primitivo Gonzalez  and Conrado  Laurel; that  soon after this, witness saw  Exequiel Castillo strike Jose  Laurel a blow with a cane and the:latter stagger and. start to run, pursued by the former, the aggressor; that at this juncture,  Conrado  Laurel approached Exequiel  and, in turn, struck him  from  behind;  and that  the police  presently intervened in the  fight,  and witness left the place where it occurred.<\/p>\n<p>The defendant Domingo Panganiban testified that, while he was at the entertainment that night, he noticed that it threatened to rain, and therefore left the house to  get  his horse, which he  had left tied to a post near the door; that, on  reaching the ground  floor, the  brothers  Roque  and Exequiel Castillo, asked him to do them the favor to call Jose  Laurel, because they  wished to  talk to the latter, witness noticing that the said brothers were then provided with canes; that he called Jose Laurel,  but the latter said that he did not wish to go down, because he was listening to the discourse which was then being delivered, and witness therefore went  down  to  report the answer to the said brothers; that while he was at the door of the parochial building  waiting for the drizzle to cease, Jose Laurel and Felipe Almeda came up to where  he was, and just then Exequiel Castillo approached the former, Laurel, and they both drew aside, about 2 brazas away,  to talk; that soon afterwards, witness saw Exequiel Castillo deal Jose Laurel two blows in succession and the latter stagger and start to run, pursued by his assailant; the latter was met by seyeral persons who crowded about in an aimless  manner, among whom witness  recognized  Roque  Castillo  and Conrado Laurel;  and that  he did  not see  Primitivo Gonzalez nor Oaudencio Garcia at the place  where  the  fight occurred, although he remained where he was until a policeman was called.<\/p>\n<p>Conrado Laurel,  a cousin  of Jose Laurel, testified that, on the night of December 28,1909, .he was  in the parochial building  for the purpose  of attending  the  entertainment; that he  was then  carrying  a revolver,  which had  neither cartridges nor firing pin, for the purpose of returning it to its owner, who was  a  Constabulary  telegraph operator on  duty  in the pueblo of Tanauan; that the latter, having been  informed by a gunsmith that the  said revolver  could not be fixed, requested  witness, when they met each  other in the .cockpit the previous afternoon, to return the weapon to him during the entertainment; that, on leaving the said building to retire to his house  and change his clothes,  he met Roque Castillo, his cousin  and confidential friend,  on the ground floor of the parochial building or convent and the latter,  seeing that witness was carrying a revolver, insisted on borrowing it, notwithstanding that witness told him that it was unserviceable; that, after he had changed his clothes, he left his house to return to the parochial building, and near the main door of said building he found Exequiel Castillo and Jose Laurel talking by themselves; that a few  moments afterwards, he saw Exequiel strike Jose two blows  with a cane that nearly caused him to fall at full length on the ground, and that Jose immediately got up and started to  run,  pursued by his assailant,  Exequiel; that witness, on seeing this, gave the latter in turn a blow on the head with a cane, to stop him from  pursuing Jose; witness fearing that the pursuer,  should he overtake the pursued, would kill him; that, after witness struck Exequiel Castillo with the cane,  the police intervened and  arrested them; and  that,  among  those arrested, he saw Panganiban and Vicente Garcia, and, at the place of the disturbance, Roque Castillo and  Primitivo Gonzalez.<\/p>\n<p>Vicente Garcia denied having taken part in the fight.  He testified that he also was attending the entertainment and, feeling warm, went down out of  the parochial building; that,  upon so doing,  he saw Domingo  Panganiban  and Jose Laurel, but was not present at  the fight, and only observed, on leaving the building,  that there was  a commotion; then he heard that a  policeman  had arrested Jose, Laurel.<\/p>\n<p>Well-written briefs were  filed in first instance,  both by the prosecution and by the defense; but, notwithstanding the large  number of persons who must have  been eyewitnesses to what occurred, it is certain that the prosecution was only able to present the  witness, Primitivo  Gonzalez, a relative of Exequiel Castillo, to testify as to how and by whom the assault was begun.<\/p>\n<p>Each one of the combatants, Exequiel Castillo and Jose Laurel, accused the other of having commenced the assault. Castillo testified that Laurel, after the exchange of a few words between them, suddenly and without warning stabbed him with a knife, while Laurel swore that,  after a short conversation Castillo struck him two blows with a cane, on which account,  in  order to  defend  himself, he  seized a pocketknife he carried in his pocket.   In view, therefore, of these manifest contradictions, and in order to determine the liability of the defendant, Jose Laurel, who, it.is proved, inflicted the serious wound on Exequiel Castillo, it is necessary to decide which of the two was the assailant.<\/p>\n<p>Taking for granted that  Jose Laurel did actually kiss Concepcion Lat in the street and in the presence of Exequiel Castillo, the girl's  suitor,  and of others who were accompanying her, the first query that  naturalLY arises in the examination  of the evidence and the circumstances connected with the occurrence, is:  Who provoked the encounter  between  Laurel  and Castillo,  and  the interview between the same, and who invited  the other, on the night of December 28,  1909, to come  down from the parochial building of Tanauan, to  the lower floor and outside  the entrance  of the  same?  Even on this  concrete point  the evidence is contradictory, for, while the witnesses of Exequiel Castillo swore that  the latter was  invited by  Jose Laurel, those of the latter testified, in  turn, that Laurel was invited three consecutive times by three different messengers in the name and on the part of the said Castillo. In the presence of this marked contradiction, and being compelled to inquire into the truth  of the matter, we are forced to think that  the person who would consider himself aggrieved  at the  kiss given the girl  Concepcion Lat, in the street and in the presence of several witnesses,  would undoubtedly be  Exequiel Castillo, the suitor of the girl, and it would appear to be a  reasonable conclusion that he himself, highly offended at the boldness of Jose Laurel, was the person who wished to demand explanation of the offense.<\/p>\n<p>Upon this premise, and having weighed and  considered as a  whole  the  testimony,  circumstantial evidence,  and  other merits of the present case, the conviction is acquired, by the  force  of  probability,  that  the invitation, given through the medium of several individuals,  came from the man  who  was offended  by the incident  of the  kiss,  and that it was the perpetrator of the offense who was invited to come down  from the parochial building to the ground floor thereof to make explanations regarding the insult to the girl  Lat, the  real suitor of whom was at the time the said Exequiel  Castillo.   All this is  not mere conjecture; it is logically derived from the above related facts.<\/p>\n<p>Both Jose and Exequiel were attending the entertainment that night  in  the upper story of the  parochial building. Exequiel was the first who went below,  with his cousin, Primitivo Gonzalez,  knowing that Laurel  remained in the hall above,  and he it was who waited  for nearly half an hour on  the ground  floor of the said building for the said Jose Laurel to  come down.  The latter was notified three times, and  successively,  in  the name and on the part of Exequiel Castillo,  first by  Domingo Panganiban,  then by Alfredo  Yatco  and finally  by Felipe Almeda\u2014three summonses which were  necessary before Jose Laurel could be induced, after  the lapse  of nearly half an  hour, to come down.   Meanwhile, for that space of time,  Exequiel Castillo was awaiting him,  undoubtedly for the  purpose of demanding explanations concerning the offensive act committed against his  sweetheart.   The natural  course and the rigorous logic of the facts can not arbitrarily be rejected, unless it be shown  that other  entirely anomalous facts occurred.<\/p>\n<p>If, in  the natural  order of things, the person who was deeply offended by the insult was the one  who believed he had a right to  demand explanations  of  the perpetrator of that insult,  it is quite probable that the  aggrieved party was the  one who,  through the instrumentality of several persons,  invited the insulter to come down from the upper story of the parochial building, where he was, and make the explanations  which  he believed he had a right  to exact;  and if this be so, Exequiel Castillo,  seriously  affected and offended by the insult to his sweetheart, Conception Lat, must be held to be the one who brought about the encounter, gave the  invitation  and provoked the  occurrence, as shown by his conduct in immediately going down to the entrance door of the said building and in resignedly waiting, for half an hour,  for Jose Laurel to  come down.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, if the  latter  had provoked the encounter or interview had on the ground floor  of the building, it is not understood why he delayed  in  going down,,nor why it became necessary to call him three times, in such manner that Exequiel Castillo had to wait for him below for half an hour, when it is natural and logical to suppose that the provoking party or the one interested in receiving explanations would be precisely the one who would have hastened to be in waiting at the place of the appointment; he would not have been slow  or indisposed to go down,  as was the case with Jose Laurel.<\/p>\n<p>If,  as is true,  the latter was the one who insulted the girl Concepcion Latan  insult which must deeply  have affected the mind of Exequiel  Castillo, the girl's suitor at the time\u2014it is not possible to conceive, as claimed by the prosecution,  how and why it should be Jose Laurel who should seek explanations from Exequiel Castillo.  It was natural and much more likely that it should have been the latter who had an interest in demanding explanations from the man  who  insulted his sweetheart. In view of the behavior of the men  a few moments  before the  occurrence, we are of the opinion that Castillo was the first to go down to the entrance door of the parochial building, knowing that Jose Laurel was in the hall, and, notwithstanding the state of his mind, he had the patience to wait for the said Laurel who, it appears, was very reluctant to go down and it was necessary to  call  him three times before he finally did so, at the end of half an hour.<\/p>\n<p>After considering these occurrences which took place before the crime, the query of course  arises as to which  of the two was the first to assault the other, for each  lays the blame upon  his  opponent for the commencement  of  the assault.  Exequiel Castillo testified that after he had  replied to Jose Laurel that he, the witness, was not obliged to  say whether he had in his possession several letters  addressed by Laurel  to the girl Concepcion Lat, Laurel immediately stabbed him  in the breast with a knife; while Jose  Laurel swore that, upon his  answering  the question put to him by Castillo as to why witness had kissed his sweetheart, saying that it was because she was very fickle and prodigal of the word \"yes\" on all occasions, Exequiel said to  him in reply that he ought not to  act  in that manner, and  immediately struck him a couple of blows on the head  with a club, wherefore,  in order to defend himself, he drew  the knife he was carrying in his pocket.<\/p>\n<p>Were the statements made by Exequiel Castillo satisfactorily proven at the trial, it is  unquestionable  that Jose Laurel  would be liable  as  the author of the punishable act under prosecution; but, in view of the antecedents aforerelated, the conclusions reached from the evidence, and  the other merits  of the case, the conclusion is certain that  the assault  was commenced  by Exequiel Castillo,  who  struck Jose Laurel two blows with a cane, slightly injuring him in two  places on the head,  and the assaulted  man, in self-defense,  wounded his assailant with a pocketknife;  therefore, Jose Laurel committed no crime and is exempt from all responsibility, as the infliction of the wounds was attended by the three  requisites specified in paragraph 4, article 8 of the Penal Code.<\/p>\n<p>From  the  evidence, then,  produced  at the trial, it is concluded that it was  Exequiel Castillo who, through  the mediation of several others,  invited  Laurel to come down from the upper story of  the parochial building, and that it  was he,  therefore, who provoked the affray aforementioned, and, also, it was he who unlawfully assaulted Jose Laurel, by  striking the latter two blows with a cane inasmuch as it is not likely that after having received a dangerous wound in the left breast, he would have been able to strike his alleged assailant two successive blows and much  less pursue him. It is very probable that he received the said wounds after he  had assaulted Jose Laurel with the cane, and Laurel, on his  part, in defending himself from the assault, employed  rational means by using the  knife that he carried in his  pocket.<\/p>\n<p>For all the foregoing reasons, Jose Laurel must be acquitted and held  to  be exempt from  responsibility on the ground of self-defense.  The case falls within paragraph 4 of article 8 of the Penal Code, inasmuch as the defensive act executed by him  was  attended by the three requisites of illegal aggression on the  part of Exequiel Castillo,  there being a lack of sufficient provocation on the part of Laurel, who, as we have said, did not provoke the occurrence complained of,  nor did he direct that  Exequiel Castillo  be invited to. come  down from the parochial  building and arrange the interview in which Castillo alone was interested, and, finally, because Laurel, in defending himself with a pocketknife  against the assault  made  upon him  with  a cane, which may also be a  deadly weapon, employed reasonable means to prevent or repel the same.<\/p>\n<p>Under the foregoing reasoning, the other  accused, Conrado Laurel and  Vicente  Garcia  who, likewise, were convicted as principals of the crime  under prosecution, are comprised within the provisions of paragraph 5 of the said article 8 of the Penal Code, which are as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"He who acts in defense of the person or rights of his spouse, ascendants, descendants, or legitimate, natural, or adopted brothers or sisters, or of his relatives by affinity in the same degrees and those by consanguinity within the fourth civil  degree, provided the first and second circumstances mentioned in the foregoing number are attendant, and  provided that in  case the party attacked first gave provocation, the defender  took no part therein.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Conrado Laurel and  Vicente Garcia, first cousins of Jose Laurel, as shown in the trial record  to have been proven without contradiction  whatsoever, did  not  provoke the trouble, nor did they take any part  in the invitation extended  to Jose Laurel  in  the name  of and for Exequiel Castillo; in assisting  in  the  fight between Castillo  and Laurel, they acted in defense of their cousin, Jose Laurel, when they  saw that  the latter was assaulted, twice struck and even pursued by the  assailant, Castillo; consequently Conrado Laurel and  Vicente Garcia have not transgressed the law and they are exempt  from all  responsibility, for all the requisites of  paragraph 4 of the aforecited article attended the acts performed by them, as there was illegal aggression on the part  of the wounded man, Exequiel Castillo,  reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel the said aggression on the part of the aforementioned Conrado Laurel and Vicente Garcia, who acted in defense of their cousin, Jose Laurel, illegally assaulted by Exequiel Castillo, neither of the said codefendants having provoked the alleged  crime.<\/p>\n<p>With regard to  Domingo Panganiban,  the only act of which he  was accused by the  wounded man, Exequiel Castillo, was that he struck the latter a blow  on the  left side with his fist, while Castillo was pursuing Laurel.<\/p>\n<p>Domingo Panganiban denied that he took part in  the quarrel and stated that he kept at  a distance from  the combatants, until he was  arrested by a policeman.   His testimony appears to  be corroborated by that of Primitivo Gonzalez, a witness  for the prosecution  and  relative of Exequiel  Castillo,  for  Gonzalez positively  declared that Panganiban was beside him during the  occurrence of  the fight  and when the others surrounded the  said Exequiel Castillo; it is, therefore, neither probable nor possible that Panganiban engaged  in the affray, and so he contracted no responsibility whatever.<\/p>\n<p>Exequiel  Castillo's  wounds were very serious, but, in view  of the fact that conclusive proof was adduced at  the trial,  of the attendance of the requisites prescribed in Nos. 4 and 5 of  article 8 of the Penal Code,  in favor of those who inflicted the said  wounds, it is proper to apply to this case the provision contained in  the next to the  last paragraph of rule 51 of the provisional law for the application of the said code.<\/p>\n<p>With respect to the classification of the crime we believe that there is no need for us to concern ourselves therewith in this decision, in view of the findings of fact and of law made by the court below upon the question of the liability of the defendants.<\/p>\n<p>By  reason,  therefore,  of all the foregoing, we are  of opinion that,  with a reversal  of the  judgment appealed from,  we should  acquit,  as we do  hereby,  the defendants Jose Laurel, Vicente Garcia, Conrado Laurel,  and Domingo Panganiban.   They have committed no crime, and we  exempt  them  from  all responsibility.   The costs  of both instances shall be de oficio, and the bond given in behalf of the defendants shall immediately be canceled.<\/p>\n<p><em>Johnson, Carson, Moreland,<\/em> and <em>Trent, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<br\/>\n<\/p>\n<\/div>",

I., on or about October 1 of this year, said accused did willfully, intentionally, maliciously, and in perversion of the truth, for the purpose of registering as a voter in precinct No. 1 of said municipality, make important statements under oath, knowingly taken, in the presence of the election inspectors of said precinct, to the effect that he was not delinquent in the payment of any taxes, when in fact he was, in violation of the Election Law.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>After hearing the evidence, the Honorable Jose C. Abreu, judge, found the defendant guilty of the crime charged in the complaint and sentenced him to pay a fine of P200 and the costs, and, in case of insolvency, to suffer subsidiary imprisonment.<br\/><br\/>From that sentence the defendant appealed.<br\/><br\/>From an examination of the evidence brought to this court it will be seen that practically the only defense which the defendant presented in the court below was the fact that he had been told by some one that even though he were in default in the payment of his taxes at the time he took the oath, there would be no criminal responsibility providing his taxes were paid before election day. He did not seem to think that it was a matter of any importance to make an oath that he had paid his taxes, when, as a matter of fact, he knew he had not. If he had sufficient intelligence to exercise the elective franchise, he ought to have understood that there could be no justification for swearing to a fact which he knew was false.<br\/><br\/>Paragraph 4 of section 30 of the Election Law (No. 1582) provides that any person who <i>knowingly takes<\/i> or subscribes any false oath, etc., shall be punished by imprisonment for not less than three months nor more than five years, or by a fine of riot less than P200, nor more than P2,000, or both, in the discretion of the court.<br\/><br\/>It is clearly proven in the present case that the defendant knew, at the time that he took the oath, that the facts to which he was swearing were false\u2014that he had not paid his taxes at that time. He, therefore, knowingly made the false oath in question. The mere fact that he had been advised that no criminal responsibility could result from his taking the false oath, can in no way justify his act. (U. S. vs. Arzadon, 19 Phil. Rep., 175; U. S. vs. Estavillo, 19 Phil. Rep., 478.)<br\/><br\/>The appellant alleges that the preliminary investigation had in the present case failed to show facts sufficient to justify his arrest. A preliminary investigation is only held for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not there is probable cause for the arrest of the accused. It constitutes no part of the final proceedings in the cause, unless it is presented in evidence. (U. S. vs. Abuan, 2 Phil. Rep., 130.) The facts adduced in a preliminary examination can not be used in the trial of the cause, unless they are introduced in evidence, and then generally only for the purpose of testing the credibility of witnesses. (U. S. vs. Grant, 18 Phil. Rep., 122.)<br\/><br\/>The lower court imposed subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, not only for the payment of the fine imposed, but for the costs as well. There seems to be no provision of law for the imposition of subsidiary imprisonment for a failure to pay costs. (U. S. vs. Navarro, 19 Phil. Rep,, 134; U. S. vs. Estavillo, 19 Phil. Rep., 478; U. S. vs. Castroverde, 4 Phil. Rep., 246; U. S. vs. Ibrado, 4 Phil. Rep., 330.)<br\/><br\/>A careful examination of the evidence brought to this court clearly shows that the defendant is guilty of the crime charged. The sentence of the lower court is therefore hereby affirmed, with the modification that the defendant should be relieved, in case of insolvency, from that part of the penalty imposing subsidiary imprisonment for the costs.<br\/><br\/>It is so ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa, Carson, Moreland<\/i>, and <i>Trent, JJ.<\/i>, concur. <\/div>",

The plaintiff alleged that to secure the\u00a0 payment of these two sums of money, the defendant had executed and delivered to him, on the 3d of October, 1906, a certain mortgage, upon certain property, particularly described in paragraph 2 of said alleged mortgage. (Exhibit A.)<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>The defendant answered by denying generally and specifically all of\u00a0 the allegations of the\u00a0 complaint, admitting, however, that he had borrowed from the plaintiff the sum of P340 on the 3d of October, 1906, but declared that the same had been paid on the 2d of December of the same year.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>Upon the issues thus formed, the\u00a0 Honorable Carter\u00a0 D. Johnston, judge, after hearing the evidence, found that the defendant owed the plaintiff nothing, and ordered, adjudged and decreed that the case be dismissed, with costs against the plaintiff, with the right oh the part of the plaintiff\u00a0 to file another proceeding for the P400 due him by said Maria Ifurung, if said amount of P400 is not or shall not be\u00a0 paid by the said Maria Ifurung or by her\u00a0 guarantor.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>From that judgment the plaintiff appealed and made several assignments of error in this court, all of which relate to the sufficiency of the proof adduced during the trial\u00a0 of the cause.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>The plaintiff made the alleged mortgage, dated October 3d, 1906, a part of\u00a0 his complaint.\u00a0 Its due execution was not denied under oath by the defendant.\u00a0\u00a0 Its genuineness and due execution were therefore admitted.\u00a0 (Sec, 103 of Act No. 190.)\u00a0\u00a0 This document can not be considered as a mortgage.\u00a0\u00a0 While it was executed before a notary public, it has not been recorded.\u00a0\u00a0 There is no proof in the record that the same\u00a0 had\u00a0 been\u00a0 registered.\u00a0\u00a0 (Art.\u00a0 1875, Civil\u00a0 Code.) The action, therefore,\u00a0 brought upon said\u00a0 document can in no sense be regarded as an action to foreclose a mortgage. The action is one upon a contract to pay money simply.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 The only proof adduced during the trial by the plaintiff in the first instance was\u00a0 proof showing the due execution and delivery of said alleged mortgage.\u00a0 The defendant admitted the\u00a0 execution of the document, but proved that the P340 which he had\u00a0 borrowed from the plaintiff had been paid, and presented a receipt (Exhibit No. 1) in support of that allegation.\u00a0 Later the plaintiff took the witness stand in his own behalf and admitted that the defendant had paid him the said sum of P340. The only question then remaining is as\u00a0 to whether or not the defendant was\u00a0 indebted to the\u00a0 plaintiff in the other sum\u00a0 of P400.\u00a0 The defendant attempted to show that the indebtedness of Maria Ifurung was an indebtedness in favor of one Gabriel Farmosa.\u00a0 The defendant admitted that he had acted as a witness in some way or other and had assisted Maria Ifurung in some way in relation to the said P400.\u00a0 This explanation,\u00a0 however, of the defendant, with reference to the origin\u00a0 of said indebtedness (P400)\u00a0 could not be admitted for the purpose of disputing the contents of the written document (Exhibit A).\u00a0\u00a0 (Sec. 285, Code of Civil Procedure; Pastor <em>vs,<\/em> Gaspar, 2 Phil. Rep., 592.)<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>Even admitting, however, that the defendant had guaranteed the payment of the said P400 to the plaintiff, in accord- ance\u00a0 with the facts found\u00a0 in said document\u00a0 (Exhibit A), nevertheless it does not appear that the original indebtedness was due nor that Maria Ifurung had\u00a0 not\u00a0 paid the same. From an examination of said document it will appear that the defendant only made himself liable for the payment of the .said P400, upon the condition that\u00a0 the said sum\u00a0 may not have\u00a0 been\u00a0 paid before the maturity of said\u00a0 contract. There is not a word of proof in\u00a0 the record showing that Maria Ifurung was in default of the payment of the said sum of money.\u00a0\u00a0 We find nothing in the record upon which we can base a judgment in favor of the\u00a0 plaintiff even for the P400.\u00a0 Therefore the\u00a0 judgment of the lower court is hereby affirmed, without prejudice to the right of the plaintiff to bring another action to recover the said sum of P400.

There he found his brother, Santos Pasia, and lodged in the latter's house, wherein also lodged Albino Magtibay and Filomeno de Torres. Before returning to Ibaan, Nicomedes Pasia counted the proceeds of his sales and found them to be P540.50, an operation which Magtibay and Torres witnessed.<br\/><br\/>The next day Nicomedes Pasia and his son Candido took the steamer for Calamba, and Magtibay and Torres also embarked in the same steamer. On the morning of July 10. Torres, Magtibay, the boy Candido, and Nicomedes Pasia were seen, one behind the other, in the road that passes through a barrio of Lipa adjacent to a barrio of Ibaan. On the same morning they were seen ascending the slope of a trail in a wooded spot called Madrecacao, and also when they were descending the slope, each with a bundle, the boy Candido in front, behind him Magtibay, then Nicomedes Pasia and Torres last. The traveler who had met them in the road leading down the slope heard the boy soon afterwards crying out: \"Why are you killing my father?\" This caused him to turn back to the place whence the cry came, and concealing himself in the underbrush he saw at a distance of some 20 feet Nicomedes stretched out on the ground and Torres dragging him by the legs in order to remove him to a place covered with bushes, while Magtibay was chasing the boy.<br\/><br\/>It was about 10 o'clock in the morning of that same day when Magtibay and Torres were seen also at some 1,500 yards from the said <i>sitio<\/i> of Madrecacao with their hands and the cuffs and bosoms of their shirts stained with blood, going in the direction of the town of Rosario. At noon Magtibay and Torres arrived by <i>calesa<\/i> at an eating place in the pueblo of Rosario, where they met an acquaintance, whom they cautioned not to tell that he had seen them at that time and place. On the following day, the 11th, the corpses of Nicomedes Pasia and Candido Pasia, almost beheaded and partly disemboweled, were found in the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">sitio<\/span> of Madrecacao. From that time on, Magtibay and Torres appeared no more around Ibaan. The first to be arrested was Magtibay, upon whom was pronounced sentence of death, which was affirmed by this Supreme Court, as appears on page 151 of volume 9 of the Official Gazette.<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> When Torres was arrested, the present cause was prosecuted against him and he was therein sentenced to the same penalty.<br\/><br\/>The sentence, which comes before us for review, is entirely suited to the merits of the case and in conformity with law, according to the minute exposition of the conclusions of fact and of law on which it is based, in the aforesaid decision already published in the Official Gazette, to which we refer throughout, as the merits of that case are identical with those of the case at bar.<br\/><br\/>But the defense in this instance avers that there is no ground for holding that there was either deliberate premeditation or the circumstances of superior strength and uninhabited place; and that therefore Filomeno Torres should be sentenced only to life imprisonment.<br\/><br\/>The penalty for the complex crime of robbery with homicide is life imprisonment to death. (Penal Code, 503, 1.)<br\/><br\/>As established in the judgment cited, there is no mitigating circumstance that can be held in the accused's favor. And this Supreme Court has constantly refused to apply article 11 of the Penal Code in favor of persons convicted of robbery, much less those convicted of robbery with homicide.<br\/><br\/>It being established that when the penalty prescribed for the crime be composed of two indivisible ones, as in the present case, the greater will be applied if in the act there concurred any aggravating circumstance, it necessarily follows that in this case, where the penalty provided is life imprisonment or death, the greater must be applied, especially as there is no mitigating circumstance to offset the generic aggravating circumstances of deliberate premeditation, abuse of superior strength and uninhabited place.<br\/><br\/>The defense claims that none of these three should be taken into account and argues against the facts held by the lower court to demonstrate the elements that constitute such circumstances; but a proper estimation of these circumstances has already been made in the decision in the case against Magtibay, to which we have referred.<br\/><br\/>What might have been averred is that deliberate premeditation, according to the precedent established by this Supreme Court, is inherent in the crime of robbery and should not be taken into account separately.<br\/><blockquote>\"It is incontrovertible\u2014says a decision of the supreme court of Spain\u2014and quite evident, that for its execution the crime of robbery requires in the majority of instances, and always when employing force on things, some premeditation, wherefore this court has repeatedly declared that this circumstance should be regarded as inherent in said crime.\" (Decision of December 7, 1885.)<br\/><\/blockquote>But the same court has also laid down the principle, strictly applicable to the case at bar, \"That if the trial court considers deliberate premeditation as an aggravating circumstance, isolating for the purpose of such characterization the established fact that the culprit took pains to accompany the persons robbed for the purpose of consummating the robbery in a place which seemed to him best suited therefor, it is beyond doubt that he does so intentionally, because this conduct on the part of the accused demonstrates studied and persistent thought, which characterizes said circumstance in accordance with intelligent construction of the law and the legal precedents established.\" (Decision of February 25, 1881.)<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with the costs of this instance.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Moreland<\/i>, and <i>Trent, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><br\/><hr align=\"LEFT\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> 17 Phil.

Wong Kim Ark (169 U.\u00a0 S., 649.)\u00a0 The facts in the case were: Wong Kim Ark was born in 1873 in the city of San Francisco\u00a0 and\u00a0 was a\u00a0 laborer.\u00a0\u00a0 His father\u00a0 and mother were persons of Chinese descent, and subjects of the Emperor of China; they\u00a0 were, at\u00a0 the time of his birth, domiciled residents of the United States; and they continued to reside and remain there until 1890, when they departed for China.\u00a0 During all the time of their residence in the United States they were engaged in business and were never employed in any\u00a0 diplomatic or official capacity under the Emperor of\u00a0 China.\u00a0 Wong Kim Ark ever since his birth had but one residence, to wit, in California;\u00a0 and had there resided, claimed to\u00a0 be a citizen\u00a0 of the United States, and had never lost or\u00a0 changed\u00a0 that residence\u00a0 or gained or acquired another;\u00a0 and neither he nor his parents acting for him ever renounced his allegiance to the United States or did or committed any act or thing to\u00a0 exclude him therefrom. In\u00a0 1890 when he was still a minor\u00a0 he departed for China on\u00a0 a\u00a0 temporary visit and returned\u00a0 in the same year and was permitted by\u00a0 the Collector of\u00a0 Customs\u00a0 to\u00a0 enter\u00a0 the United\u00a0 States upon the ground that he was a native-born citizen of that country.\u00a0\u00a0 After such return he remained in the United States claiming to be a citizen thereof until 1894, when he again departed for China on a temporary visit and with the intention of returning.\u00a0 He did return in August, 1895, and applied to the Collector of Customs for permission to land and was denied such permission upon the sole ground that he\u00a0 was\u00a0 not a\u00a0 citizen of the United States.\u00a0 It\u00a0 was conceded\u00a0 that if he was a\u00a0 citizen\u00a0 of the United\u00a0 States the Acts of Congress known as\u00a0 the Chinese Exclusion Acts, prohibiting persons\u00a0 of the Chinese\u00a0 race, and especially Chinese laborers, from entering the United States, did not and could not apply to him.<\/p><p>Wong Kim Ark filed\u00a0 a petition in the United States District Court for a writ of habeas corpus,\u00a0 alleging1 that he\u00a0 was a\u00a0 citizen of the\u00a0 United States\u00a0 entitled to enter that country\u00a0 as\u00a0 such, and that\u00a0 he was\u00a0 illegally detained by\u00a0 the Collector of Customs.\u00a0 The writ\u00a0 was issued, and after hearing the petitioner was directed\u00a0 to be discharged from custody.\u00a0 The respondent\u00a0 appealed\u00a0 to\u00a0 the Supreme Court\u00a0 of the United States. That court,\u00a0 after a very exhaustive examination of the questions presented, affirmed the judgment of the district court, saying:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"The fourteenth amendment (to the Constitution of the United States) affirms the ancient and fundamental rule of citizenship by birth within the territory, in the allegiance and\u00a0 under\u00a0 the\u00a0 protection of\u00a0 the country,\u00a0 including all children here\u00a0 born of resident aliens, with the exception or qualifications (as old as the rule itself) of children\u00a0 of foreign sovereigns\u00a0 or their ministers, or\u00a0 born on foreign public\u00a0 ships, Cor of enemies within and\u00a0 during a hostile occupation\u00a0 of\u00a0 part of our territory, and\u00a0 with the single additional exception of children of members of the Indian tribes owing direct allegiance to their several tribes.\u00a0\u00a0 The amendment, in clear words and in manifest intent, includes the children born, within the territory of the United States, of all other persons, of whatever race or\u00a0 color, domiciled within\u00a0 the United States.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The questions presented in this case were\u00a0 definitely settled the Supreme\u00a0 Court of the\u00a0 United\u00a0 States.\u00a0 According to the\u00a0 doctrine here enunciated,\u00a0 it\u00a0 is quite clear that\u00a0 if the\u00a0 appellant\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 case\u00a0 at bar had been\u00a0 born in the United States and was now trying to reenter\u00a0 that country under the same circumstances\u00a0 that he is now trying to reenter this Country, he would be entitled to land upon the ground that he was a citizen of the United\u00a0 States. By the laws of the j United States, citizenship depends\u00a0 generally upon the place of birth.\u00a0\u00a0 This\u00a0 is the doctrine of <em>jus soli,<\/em>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and predominates.\u00a0 Consequently, any person born in the United States (with certain specific exceptions) is a citizen of that country, owes\u00a0 it allegiance,\u00a0 and is entitled to its. protection.<\/p><blockquote><p>\"The right of\u00a0 expatriation is a\u00a0 natural\u00a0 and inherent right of all\u00a0 people.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Act of Congress, July 27, 1868.) Expatriation is the voluntary renunciation or abandonment of nationality and allegiance.\u00a0 The Act of Congress of 1868 does apt define what steps must be taken by a citizen before it\u00a0 can be\u00a0 held that he has become denationalized. In fact, there is\u00a0 no mode of renunciation of citizenship prescribed by law in the United States.\u00a0\u00a0 Whether expatriation has taken place in any instance in that country must be determined by the facts and circumstances of the particular case.\u00a0 No\u00a0 general rule that will apply to all\u00a0 cases\u00a0 can be laid down.\u00a0 (Once a person becomes an American citizen, either\u00a0 by birth or naturalization, it is\u00a0 assumed\u00a0 that he desires to continue to\u00a0 be a citizen of the United States, and\u00a0 this assumption stands until the contrary is shown by some voluntary act on his part.) But when he voluntarily denationalizes or expatriates himself, he then becomes an alien to the United States, and can regain his lost citizenship only by virtue of the same laws, and the same formalities, and\u00a0 by the same process by which other aliens are enabled to become citizens.\u00a0 The result is that a child born in the United States of Chinese parents^as in the case of Wong Kim Ark, <em>supra<\/em>, is\u00a0 a citizen\u00a0 of\u00a0 that country and continues\u00a0 to be such until his\u00a0 parents, during\u00a0 his minority, expatriate him, or he, after becoming of age, by some voluntary overt act or acts, expatriates himself,\u00a0 If this is done by his parents during his minority, it might be (a question we do not decide) that he could, on becoming of age, elect the nationality of his birth\u00a0 (the United States).<\/p><\/blockquote><p>A reading of article 17 of the Civil\u00a0 Code,\u00a0 above copied, is sufficient to show\u00a0 that the first paragraph affirms\u00a0 and recognizes\u00a0 the principle of nationality by\u00a0 place of birth, <em>jus soli<\/em>.\u00a0\u00a0 The second, that of <em>jus sanguinis;<\/em> and\u00a0 the\u00a0 last two\u00a0 that\u00a0 of free election, with the first\u00a0 predominating. Article 18 provides that children,\u00a0 while they remain undei parental\u00a0 authority, have the\u00a0 nationality of their parents. A married woman follows the condition and nationality of her&gt; husband.\u00a0\u00a0 (Article\u00a0 22.)\u00a0 Consequently,\u00a0 according to those provisions, the children, during their minority\u00a0 and while they are under parental authority, have, as a general rule, the nationality of their father.\u00a0 In order that children born of foreign parents in Spanish territory might enjoy the benefits appertaining to\u00a0 Spanish nationality,\u00a0 it was necessary for\u00a0 their parents, if they were minors, to make a formal declaration\u00a0 before\u00a0 the proper authorities to the effect that\u00a0 they choose for their children that nationality and renounce\u00a0 all others,\u00a0 The children, within one year after\u00a0 becoming of age or after emancipation,\u00a0 could elect the\u00a0 nationality of their\u00a0 birth and enjoy the benefits pertaining thereto by making the declaration required in article 19 and in the manner set forth therein.\u00a0 In either instance\u00a0 a positive, overt act was essential.\u00a0 In the absence of any\u00a0 such acts, it was not\u00a0 assumed that the children or their\u00a0 parents for them elected the nationality of the country of their birth.\u00a0\u00a0 The contrary rule prevails in the United States.<\/p><p>According to the second paragraph of article 22 of\u00a0 the Civil Code, a Spanish woman who married a foreigner could, upon the dissolution of the marriage,\u00a0 recover her Spanish nationality by complying with the requisites mentioned in article 21. (This latter article provided that a Spaniard who had lost his citizenship by acquiring the\u00a0 nationality of a foreign\u00a0 country could recover it upon returning\u00a0 to\u00a0 the Spanish Kingdom by indicating before the proper\u00a0 officials the domicile which\u00a0 he elected as\u00a0 his residence and by\u00a0 renouncing the protection of the flag of said country. As a general rule under Spanish law there was no question about the nationality of a married woman following that of her husband. THere might have been cases of marrlage, however, where\u00a0\u00a0 neither the nationality of the wife nor that of the children would follow that of the husband and father. Such, for instance, would be the case if the laws governing citizenship .of the country\u00a0 of\u00a0 the father prohibited the\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 nationalizing\u00a0 of\u00a0 the wife and children.\u00a0 It would\u00a0 there necessarily follow that the wife did not lose her nationality upon marriage, nor would the nationality of the children follow that of the father.\u00a0 But with this class, if there be such, we are not\u00a0 now dealing.<\/p><p>Section 1994 of the Revised Statutes of the United States provides that \"any woman\u00a0 who\u00a0 is now or may hereafter be married to a\u00a0 citizen\u00a0 of the United\u00a0 States,\u00a0 and\u00a0 who might hereafter be lawfully nationalized, shall be deemed a citizen.\"\u00a0 The phrase \"shall be deemed a citizen\" in said section, or as it was\u00a0 in the Act of 1855, \"shall be deemed and\u00a0 taken to be\u00a0 a citizen,\" while it may imply that the person to whom it relates has not actually become a citizen by the\u00a0 ordinary\u00a0 means or\u00a0 in the usual way,\u00a0 as by the judgment of a competent court upon a proper application and\u00a0 proof, yet it does\u00a0 not\u00a0 follow that such personals on that account any\u00a0 the less a citizen.\u00a0 The word \"deemed\" is the equivalent of \"considered\"\u00a0 or \"judged,\" and therefore, whatever an Act Congress requires to be deemed or taken as true of\u00a0 any person or thing must in law be considered as having been duly adjudged\u00a0 or established concerning such person\u00a0 or thing, and have force and effect accordingly.\u00a0 When Congress declared that an alien woman shall, under certain circumstances, be deemed an\u00a0 American citizen, the effect, when the contingency occurs, is equivalent to her being nationalized directly by an Act of\u00a0 Congress, or in the usual\u00a0 mode\u00a0 thereby prescribed.\u00a0 (Leonard <em>vs.<\/em> Grant, 6 Sawy., 603;\u00a0 5 Fed., 16.)<\/p><p>The Supreme Court of the United States said in Kelley <em>vs.<\/em> Owen, 7 Wall., 496, that the object of the Act was to allow the citizenship of the wife \"to follow that of her husband without the necessity of any application for naturalization on her part.\"<\/p><p>Under the statute\u00a0 and these decisions, an alien woman who marries a citizen\u00a0 of the\u00a0 United States is\u00a0 \"deemed\" a citizen.\u00a0 Is the converse\u00a0 of this rule\u00a0 true?\u00a0\u00a0 Does an American woman become an alien by\u00a0 marriage to a foreigner?\u00a0 There is no, statutory declaration\u00a0 to that effect.<\/p><p>This question is one which has not been definitely solved, and the contrariety of opinion upon it shows it to be difficult of solution.\u00a0 The doubt arises\u00a0 as to what effect should be given to modern statutes on naturalization and expatriation. In the case of Shanks <em>vs.<\/em> Dupont (28 U. S., 242), decided in 1830, the Supreme\u00a0 Court of\u00a0 the United States said:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"Neither did the marriage\u00a0 with Shanks\u00a0 produce that effect; because marriage with an alien, whether a friend or an enemy, produces\u00a0 no dissolution of the native allegiance of the wife.\u00a0\u00a0 It\u00a0 may change her\u00a0 civil rights, but it does not\u00a0 affect\u00a0 her political rights\u00a0 or privileges.\u00a0\u00a0 The general doctrine is, that no persons\u00a0 can,\u00a0 by\u00a0 any act of their own, without the consent\u00a0 of the government, put off their allegiance and become aliens.\u00a0\u00a0 If\u00a0 it were otherwise, then a <em>feme <\/em> alien would by her marriage become, <em>ipso facto<\/em>, a citizen, and would be dowable of the estate of her husband; which are clearly contrary to law.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>In Pequignot\u00a0 <em>vs<\/em>.

Articles 17 to 27, inclusive,, of the Civil Code deal\u00a0 entirely with the subject of Spanish citizenship.\u00a0 When these provisions were enacted,\u00a0 Spain was and is now the sole and exclusive judge as to who shall and who shall not be subjects of her\u00a0 kingdom,, including her territories.\u00a0\u00a0 Consequently, the said articles,\u00a0 being political laws (laws regulating the relations sustained by the inhabitants to the former sovereign) , must be held to have been abrogated upon the cession of the Philippine Islands to the United States.<\/p><blockquote><p>\"By well-settled public law, upon the cession of territory by one nation to another, either following a conquest or otherwise,\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 those laws which are political in their nature and pertain\u00a0 to the prerogatives of the former government\u00a0 immediately cease\u00a0 upon\u00a0 the transfer of\u00a0 sovereignty.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Opinion, Atty.

A natural\u00a0 born American citizen or\u00a0 Spanish subject means an\u00a0 American citizen or Spanish subject who has become such at the moment of his birth J Citizenship, says Moore on International Law, strictly speaking, is a term of municipal law and denotes the possession within the particular state of full civil and political rights subject to special disqualifications, such as minority, sex, etc.\u00a0\u00a0 The conditions on which citizenship are acquired are regulated by municipal law. There is no\u00a0 such thing as international\u00a0 citizenship nor international law (aside from that which might be contained in treaties) by which citizenship\u00a0 may be\u00a0 acquired.\u00a0 It\u00a0 therefore follows that the only law applicable to the questions presented in the case at bar is the Treaty of Paris and the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902.<\/p><p>The relations which\u00a0 the inhabitants of ceded\u00a0 territory shall bear to the acquiring state are generally determined by the treaty of cession. Every\u00a0 treaty of cession to which the United States has been a party, with the exception of the\u00a0 Treaty of Peace of 1898 with Spain, ceding Porto Rico and the\u00a0 Philippine Islands to\u00a0 the United States; contains a stipulation providing that the the inhabitants of the territory ceded may in whole or in part become citizens of United States either immediately or under certain conditions. In the Treaty of Paris the high contracting parties agreed that the civil rights and political status of the native inhabitants of the Philippine Islands shall be determihed by the Congress of\u00a0 the\u00a0 United States.\u00a0 The\u00a0 contracting\u00a0 parties\u00a0 further agreed that\u00a0 all Spanish\u00a0 subjects,\u00a0 natives of the Peninsula, who\u00a0 were residing in the Philippine\u00a0 Islands at the\u00a0 time\u00a0\u00a0 Spain relinquished\u00a0 her sovierignty\u00a0 over this country may continue to reside here\u00a0 and preserve their allegiance to the Crown of Spain by so declaring within the time and in the manner set forth in article 9. In conformity with the provisions of this Treaty, Congress, by the Act of July 1, 1902, providing for the admmistration of\u00a0 the\u00a0 affairs\u00a0 of\u00a0 civil goverment in the Philipipine Islands, enacted section 4, above quoted. Here Congress declared that all inhabitants of the\u00a0 Bhilippine Islands\u00a0 continuing\u00a0 to reside therein who were Spanish subjects on the 11th of April, 1899, and then resided in this country, and their children born subsequent thereto, shall be deemed and held to be citizens of this country. According to those provisions it is not necessary for such persons to do anything whatsoever in order that they may acquire full citizenship. The same is true with reference to Spanish subjects who subjects \u00abwere born in\u00a0 Spain proper and who had not elected to retain their allegiance to the crown. By section 4 the doctrine or princliple of citizenship by place of birth which prevails in the United States was extended to the Philippine Islands, but with limitations. In the United States every person, with certain specific exceptions, born in the United States is a citizen of that ocuntry. Under section 4 every person born after the 11th of April, 1889, of parents who were Spanish subjects on that date and who continued to reside in this country are at the moment of their birth\u00a0 <em>ipso facto<\/em> citizens of the Phi;ippine Islands. From the reading\u00a0 of section 4\u00a0 and taking into consideration the Act of March 23,\u00a0 1912, it\u00a0 is clear that Congress realized that there were inhabitants\u00a0 in the Philippine Islands who did not\u00a0 come within the provisions of said section, and also that Congress did not then by express legislation\u00a0 determine the political status of\u00a0 such persons.\u00a0 Therefore, the inquiry is - Did Congress intend to say that all\u00a0 of the inhabitants who were not included in section 4 are to be \"deemed and held to be\" aliens to the Philippine Islands?<\/p><p>Congress by the Act of April 12,\u00a0 1900, establishing civil vernment for Porto Rico provided that:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"All inhabitants continuing to\u00a0 reside therein\u00a0 who. were Spanish subjects on the 11th day of April, 1899, and then resided in Porto Rico, and their children born subsequent thereto, shall be deemed and held to be citizens of Porto Rico, and as such entitled to the protection of the United States, except such as shall have elected to preserve their allegiance to the Crown of Spain .on or before the 11th day of April, 1900,\u00a0 in accordance with the provisions of the treaty of peace between the United States and Spain entered into on the 11th day\u00a0 of April, 1899; and they, together\u00a0 with\u00a0 such citizens of the United States as may reside in Porto Rico, shall constitute a body politic under the name of The People of Porto\u00a0 Rico,\u00a0 with governmental\u00a0 powers as hereinafter conferred, and with power to sue and be sued as such.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The treaty\u00a0 provisions and the Act of Congress of April 12, 1900, were construed by the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern\u00a0 District of\u00a0 New\u00a0 York in October, 1902, in the case of Gonzalez\u00a0 (118\u00a0 Fed., 941) upon a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.\u00a0 The\u00a0 facts in this case were as follows: The petitioner, an unmarried woman,\u00a0 a native of Porto Rico, 20 years of age, arrived in the bay of New York by steamer from\u00a0 the island of Porto Rico on August 24, 1902.\u00a0 She was\u00a0 detained at the immigrant station, was duly examined by\u00a0 a board\u00a0 of special inquiry, and was excluded\u00a0 from admission into the United States upon the ground that she was liable to become a public charge. The court said that the only question open for discussion on that application was whether or not the petitioner was an alien.\u00a0\u00a0 After examining the law applicable to the case the court concluded by saying:\u00a0 \"This legislation (Act of April 12, 1900) has certainly not operated to effect a naturalization of the\u00a0 petitioner\u00a0 as a citizen of\u00a0 the United\u00a0 States. Being foreign born and not naturalized, she remains an alien, and subject to the provisions of law regulating the admission Of aliens who come to the United States.\"<\/p><p>The\u00a0 writ was dismissed.\u00a0\u00a0 Upon\u00a0 appeal\u00a0 the\u00a0 Supreme Court\u00a0 of the United States\u00a0 reversed the\u00a0 decision\u00a0 of the Circuit Court and held\u00a0 that Miss Gonzalez was not an\u00a0 alien to the United States within\u00a0 the meaning of the laws governing the subject.\u00a0\u00a0 (192\u00a0 U.

The nationality of the Islands became American instead of Spanish.<\/p><p>The Philippine Islands prior to April 11, 1809, had been for many months under military occupation by the United States as a conquered country when by the third article of the Treaty of Paris the whole archipelago was ceded to the United States.\u00a0 The\u00a0 President, in the exercise of his war power, proceeded to\u00a0 establish a civil government and for that purpose appointed the Philippine Commission, consisting at first\u00a0 of a\u00a0 president and four members.\u00a0 This Commission acting under instructions the Secretary of War, established the\u00a0 three independent land coordinate departments of the government - executive, legislative and judicial\u00a0 and provided means for the carrying\u00a0 on of a complete civil government. The governor-general and vice-governor-general were appointed and qualified.\u00a0 Positions of secretaries of the\u00a0 various\u00a0 departments\u00a0 were\u00a0 made and\u00a0 filled. Courts were provided for, with power to hear and determine all cases arising in the Philippine Islands.\u00a0 In fact, a complete government was established with all the necessary departments for the; protection pf the life, liberty and property of all the inhabitants. The government\u00a0 thus\u00a0 established was administered through American and\u00a0 Filipino officials and classified civil service employees, all\u00a0 of\u00a0 whom before entering upon the duties\u00a0 of their office took an oath\u00a0 of allegiance to the. United States. Thereupon Congress by the Act of July 1, 1902, approved, ratified and affirmed the acts of the President in establishing the civil government.\u00a0 Provisions weref made m this act for the bringing into existence of the Philippine Assembly and for the election of Resident Commissioners who should receive their salary from the United States.\u00a0 Other provisions were made for the disposition of public lands,\u00a0 both agricultural and\u00a0 mineral, and the Act sets forth the bill of rights for this country.\u00a0 The Philippine Islands is and has been since the passage of said Act completely under the control\u00a0 of\u00a0 the Congress of the United States and all the inhabitants owe complete and full allegiance\u00a0 or a qualified temporary allegiance, as the case may be, to the United States. <\/p><p>The appellant was, as we have stated, born in the Philippine Islands\u00a0 in 1889.\u00a0\u00a0 His father was a domiciled alien and his mother a native\u00a0 of this country.\u00a0\u00a0 His father died\u00a0 in China about the year 1900 while he was still a minor.\u00a0 His mother sent him\u00a0 to China for the sole purpose of studying and on reaching his\u00a0 majority\u00a0 he returned to the\u00a0 country of his birth\u00a0 and\u00a0 sought admission.\u00a0 From the date of his birth to the time he returned to this country he had\u00a0 never in a\u00a0 legal sense\u00a0 changed\u00a0 his\u00a0 domicile.

All the laws and the rulings of the courts on the subject so declare, and this has been the declared policy\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 United States.\u00a0\u00a0 While it has been decided that the Constitution and acts of Congress do not apply <em>ex propio vigore <\/em> to this country, but that they must be expressly extended by Congress, nevertheless, some of the basic principles upon which the government of the United States rests and the greater\u00a0 part\u00a0 of the Bill of Rights, which protects the citizens of that\u00a0 country, have been extended to the Philippine Islands by the instructions of the President to the first Philippine Commission and the Philippine Bill. The Act of July 1, 1902, a part of which is section\u00a0 4, quoted <em>supra<\/em>, as before stated, ratified\u00a0 and affirmed the civil government established in the Philippine Islands by the President. It extended the Bill of Rights to the inhabitants of this country.\u00a0 It provided means for the disposition of the public lands and enacted mining laws.\u00a0 In fact,\u00a0 it approved of\u00a0 and extended\u00a0 the powers of\u00a0 a republican form\u00a0 of government modeled after that of\u00a0 the United\u00a0 States.\u00a0\u00a0 Then to hold, after all of this has been done, that Congress intended by section 4 to declare that the appellant\u00a0 is an\u00a0 alien and not entitled, under the\u00a0 circumstances, to\u00a0 reenter\u00a0 the\u00a0 land\u00a0 of his birth\u00a0 and become a citizen thereof, would be a holding contrary to the manifest intent of that body.\u00a0 That\u00a0 Congress did not so intend is irresistibly inferred\u00a0 from these\u00a0 facts.<\/p><p>Was the appellant a citizen of the\u00a0 Philippine Islands on July 1, 1902?\u00a0 If so, the Act of Congress of that date\u00a0 did not denationalize him.\u00a0 At the time this country was ceded to the United States, Basilio Roa, father of the appellant, was, let us say, a subject of the Emperor of China, and the nationality of the appellant, let us further say, followed absolutely that of his father.\u00a0\u00a0 Basilio Roa died in Chiiia in 1900.\u00a0 Tranquilirio was then a minor and living with\u00a0 his mother in this country.\u00a0 His mother, before her marriage, was, as\u00a0 we have said, a Spanish subject.\u00a0 On\u00a0 the death of her husband she\u00a0 <em>ipso facto<\/em> reacquired the nationality of the country of her birth, as she was then living in that country and had never left it.\u00a0 She was\u00a0 then\u00a0 the natural guardian of Tranquilino.\u00a0\u00a0 The question now arises, did the nationality of the appellant\u00a0 follow that of his mother, admitting that before the\u00a0 death of his father he was a Chinese subject? If his nationality followed that of his mother,\u00a0 it must have been not by reason of the Spanish law, as tnere was none in force in this, country at the time on the subject, but\u00a0 by\u00a0 means of\u00a0 analogous. principles\u00a0 of\u00a0 citizenship in America.\u00a0 Upon the dissolution\u00a0 of a marriage between a female citizen of the United States and a foreigner, she\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <em> ipso facto<\/em> reacquires American citizenship, if at that time she is residing in the United States.\u00a0 There is no statutory declaration on the question as to whether or not her minor children would follow that of their widowed\u00a0 mother. If the children were born\u00a0 in\u00a0 the United States, they would be citizens of that country. If they were born in the country of which their father (and their mother during coverture) was a citizen, then they would be citizens of that\u00a0 country until the death of their father.\u00a0\u00a0 But after his death, they, being minors and their mother being their natural guardian and she reacquiring her American nationality by returning to the United States, their\u00a0 nationality would, as a logical consequence, follow that of their mother, she having changed their domicile and nationality by placing them\u00a0 within the jurisdiction of the United\u00a0 States.\u00a0 But,\u00a0 of course,\u00a0 such minor children, on\u00a0 reaching their\u00a0 majority, could elect, under the principle that expatriation is an inherent right of all people, the nationality of the\u00a0 country of their birth.<\/p><p>The nationality of the appellant having followed that of his\u00a0 mother, he was\u00a0 therefore\u00a0 a citizen of the\u00a0 Philippine Islands on July 1, 1902, and never having expatriated himself, he still remains a citizen of\u00a0 this country.<\/p><p>We therefore conclude that the appellant is a citizen of the\u00a0 Philippine Islands and entitled to land.\u00a0 The judgment appealed from\u00a0 is\u00a0 reversed\u00a0 and\u00a0 the appellant\u00a0 is ordered released from custody, with costs <em>de oficio.<\/em><\/p><p><em> Arellano, C.

The crime is denominated in Spanish <em>atentado contra los agentes de la autoridad con homicidio.<\/em>  He appealed to this court alleging that the facts  of record are not sufficient to support the conviction.<\/p>\n<p>It appears  that on  or about 7 o'clock of the night of the 12th of October,  1909, three municipal policemen, Hipolito de la Cruz, Martin N. Cruz, and Joaquin Flores, acting under the orders of the provincial governor of Bulacan, Teodoro Sandiko, and  accompanied by Alejandro Carpio as guide, went to the house of the accused, Agustin Clemente, located in a place called Anibong, barrio of Daquila,  pueblo of Santa Maria, in the municipality of Malolos, for the purpose of raiding a gambling game known as \"jueteng.\"  They arrived there just as the money which had been bet upon the game was  being  delivered to the banker.  The policemen mixed with the crowd and waited until the game should be finished before making any arrests.  They were strangers in that locality and were unknown to the defendant.  Before entering the house they had dressed in the ordinary garb of the civilian of that locality and wore nothing that would indicate that they were officers except their  badges which, before going into the house, they had concealed under their camisas. Their purpose was to prevent being known as police officers. After the balls bearing appropriate numbers had been placed in the bottle and thoroughly shaken  up, the accused drew the lucky ball.  Just as he  drew it forth one of the policemen who was stationed near the table, Hipolito de la Cruz, seized the hand of the accused which held the bottle and fired his revolver.   These acts threw everything into confusion, and there followed the struggle in which Martin N. Cruz was killed.<\/p>\n<p>Hipolito de la Cruz testified for the  prosecution as follows in relation to the occurrence:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"There were four of us, three policemen and a private person, I think his name is  Alejandro Carpio.   We went to raid a 'jueteng' game.  When we went into the house of the accused we arrived just at the moment in which the money for the bets was being placed upon the table.  Although we arrived just at the moment the money was being bet, we were not able  to do anything  for the reason that the bottle with the balls in it had not yet been produced.  While we were thus waiting for the appearance of the bottle we heard the accused, Agustin,  say:  'I have  a  presentiment that  this game is  going to be raided.'  But he said also the following: 'But even in case the game is raided, I shall not be taken alive.'  He then turned to his companions there present and said:  'Be very careful,  inasmuch as we have gone so far we had better be ready for anything that may happen.'  He said further:  'Let those who are not ready to resist go out.'  A short time afterwards the bottle for the drawing appeared and the accused said:  'We had  better decide as to the manner in which we shall resist.  The bottle is here, and let us put ourselves in condition for resistance.' He then called to the  people that were there that he was going to draw the ball from the bottle to determine who won the game.   Before he did this he shut the windows and the doors of the house.  The accused  then  said to the people; 'What do you prefer,  to  count  the  balls or classify them as if they were cards.'  The people said: 'It is better that the balls be not counted since we also fear that we will be caught.' Agustin consented to return the  balls.  I placed my two companions in the hallway of the house for the reason that the game was being carried on in the interior of the house and I went inside for the  purpose of making the arrests.  On drawing the ball out of the bottle, I think No. 35 was the one that won the prize.  I was awaiting an appropriate moment to  seize the bottle.  I waited until Agustin should raise the bottle in his  hand and after  he drew out No. 35  and in the moment of putting it in  the bottle I seized his hand that held the bottle and with the other I discharged my revolver and said: 'Let nobody  move, because I am an officer.'   At the time I discharged my revolver Agustin Clemente tried to take the  bottle from  my hand and succeeded in doing so and with it he struck  at my face, which blow I evaded  with my hands and with the revolver.  Thereupon Agustin still holding the bottle started to leave the room.  When I saw him holding the bottle in his hand I tried to take it away from him,  using one hand for the purpose and with the other I tried to strike him with my revolver.  By reason of the  force  of the  blows which I struck him he  let loose of the bottle.  He cried  at the same time: 'Attack them, attack them.' and as he was unable to get his own weapon he went outside towards the place where my two companions were.  Then he took his large bolo out of its sheath and at that moment he was seen by my other companion  Martin N. Cruz who, placing himself behind Agustin, seized him  by the waist for the purpose undoubtedly of preventing him from drawing his bolo from the sheath.  The other policeman, Flores, who at that  moment arrived, tried to prevent the other people from getting away or escaping.  In one of his turns he met the accused and then facing him and pointing his revolver at him said: 'Don't you move because I am  also an officer.1   I do  not know how he managed to snatch the revolver from him but when the  accused succeeded in  taking the  revolver away from the policeman Flores, that is to say, the  revolver which he had and which he was pointing at the accused, the latter having come into the possession of the weapon turned half-way around and facing the policeman who  was back of him, that is, Martin N. Cruz, who was holding him by the  waist, fired at him but immediately thereafter the owner of  the revolver, Flores, succeeded  in wresting the  gun from  the accused.   Then and at that time the man who died uttered the following words: 'Hipolito,  I have just suffered this misfortune.  The old man is the one who  shot me with his gun.' While this defendant was wrestling with the policeman Flores, the latter said:  'Do not be excited. Recognize us as officers.'  And while the accused with one hand was wrestling with the policeman Flores, he at the same time was attempting to draw his bolp from the sheath.   I noticed this movement  on the part of the accused and approached him and with my  revolver struck him on the back and said: 'Mr. Agustin, do  not excite yourself.. Recognize us  as officers and surrender,1 but he said: 'If you are agents of the authorities please show me. your warrant of arrest,'  I said: 'Do not make any further resistance and we will show you the warrant.'  The accused refused to submit.   In  the meantime the house was being deserted for the reason that we were trying to capture the accused and we could not pay any attention to the other people who were there and, who were able to escape.  We policemen endeavored to take the accused to  one corner to compel him to submit and  when we succeeded in putting him to  one of the corners of the house, we  heard the voice of a person from the  outside toward the terrace and who turned out to be one of our companions and the agent of the governor and his name is Alejandro.  The accused would not give up in the fight that we had with him but I was able to take the bolo from his belt and then the accused stopped further resistance.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Further on in his testimony this witness said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"We were wearing at the time citizens' clothing like that usually worn in that part of the country, a Chinese camisa. We did not wear anything which would indicate who we were except the police badge which we wore hidden beneath our <em>camisas<\/em>.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Later on  in  his testimony  appear these questions and answers:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Q. Did Martin N. Cruz have the accused by  the waist when the  latter took the revolver from Joaquin Flores?\u2014 A. Yes, sir; he had his two hands around the waist of the accused.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. How was Joaquin Flores able to regain possession of the revolver from the accused?\u2014A.  As Joaquin Flores was in front of the accused when the latter snatched the revolver from  him and shot Martin N. Cruz who was behind him, the policeman Flores instantly snatched the revolver  from him and fired at him.  I am unable to explain how he was able to take the revolver away from the accused because he was several paces away from them at the time. \"Q. What did you policemen do there in the house that night, because in one of your previous answers you said that you agreed with the people there present when they told Agustin Clemente that it was better that he count the balls instead of shuffling the cards?\u2014A. I did not go there to gamble nor in such answer did I wish it to be understood that I was gambling.  I did that simply so as not to attract suspicion.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. And your companions  did the same as you did?\u2014A. Yes,sir.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The witness  Joaquin  Flores, generally speaking,  tells about  the  same story as the above witness,  although  he denies positively that Hipolito de la Cruz was present at the time the deceased was shot, stating that Hipolito was in another part of the room and came to  where they were only after the shot was fired.  He says in part:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Q.  You say that the accused snatched  the revolver from you.  Tell  us how he did it.\u2014A. I had the revolver in the right hand and  was pointing it at the stomach of the accused, when he  seized  the hand that held the revolver, and twisting it succeeded in taking the revolver from me.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q.  And immediately  on obtaining the revolver he discharged it?\u2014A.  Yes, sir.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>He said further:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"At the  time  he was  shot Martin N.  Cruz was  at  the left side of the  accused, because the latter on taking  the revolver from me turned half-way around toward the left and discharged it.<\/p>\n<p align=\"center\">* * * * * * *<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. When you policemen were within the house, did you make it known that you  were policemen before you  raided the game?\u2014A. No, sir.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. When did you tell  the  accused that you  were  policemen?\u2014A. When he took  my revolver.  At that time I told him I was a policeman.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The doctor who attended  the deceased during his last hours, Catalino Buktao, testified in part as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"It was a gunshot wound in the abdominal region. The bullet entered the navel and took a direction from the front toward the back, downward and toward the right.  *   *  * I was called to attend the injured man between 10 and 11 o'clock at night.<\/p>\n<p align=\"center\">*       *       *      *      *      *       *<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. State to the court,  if you please, what, according to the data which you have, was  the position  which the person who fired the shot must necessarily have occupied to produce           the wound.\u2014A. The position of the one who fired the shot must have been in front of the deceased.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Were the two  standing at  the time the shot was fired?\u2014A. They were standing.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. The one in front of the other?\u2014A. Yes, sir.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. According to the direction of the bullet, is it not possible that the person who was wounded was at the left side of the one firing the shot?\u2014A. In  turning they would find themselves face to face.<\/p>\n<p align=\"center\">*       *      *       *      *       *       *<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Do you mean to say that the  shot could not have been fired if the one  who fired it was at  the right side of the one wounded?\u2014A. Yes, sir.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The witness Alejandro Carpio, who was the cochero  of Governor  Sandiko and the guide of the policemen to the gambling house on the night in question testified as to what occurred in the  house at the time the deceased was mortally wounded as follows:<\/p>\n<p>\"The  policeman  Joaquin Flores  and the accused were struggling over the  possession of the tambiolo and the other policeman, whose name I do not know, pointed his revolver at the accused.  The accused thereupon with his hand made a motion to knock the revolver away from his body.  With that act the revolver was discharged and the bullet hit the body of the policeman Martin.\"<\/p>\n<p>He also swore,  on being recalled  by the prosecution, that he reported  the raid to Governor Sandiko that very night and told him that during the raid a policeman had <em>accidentally<\/em> been shot.<\/p>\n<p>The witness Geronimo Victoria testified in substance that, as he was passing along the street  on the night in question, he saw some persons carrying a body; that, being  curious, he followed  them to the <em>presidencia;<\/em>  that they turned.out to be the policemen  who had arrested the accused with their wounded companion; that while there, awaiting the arrival of the justice of the peace and the doctor, he heard a conversation between the wounded policeman and his companion, in which the former  charged  the latter with having been the one who shot him. Thereupon the one so charged replied: \"It would be better for you to say.that the one who shot you was the old man.\"   (Meaning the accused.)  To this statement the wounded man did not reply because of his weakened condition.<\/p>\n<p>The prosecution sought to show that this witness was not at the  presidencies on the night in question by  recalling Hipolito de la Cruz, who testified:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Q.  Did you see any  person  in  the presidencia at the time?\u2014A.  I did not see anyone there who was not a policeman.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q.  (Placing Geronimo Victoria before the witness.)  Do you know this person?\u2014A.  Yes,  sir.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q.  Did  you see him in the presidencia on the night of the shooting?\u2014A. I did not look  sharply to see him.  I was giving all of my attention to my  wounded comrade.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Would you have been able to see him then?\u2014A. No, sir; I  do not remember; I did  not give any attention  to that.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The accused, who  is in the neighborhood of 60  years  of age, testified that up to the time when he was seized and a  revolver  fired at him,  as he supposed, he did not know that there was a policeman in the room and did not expect that the game would be raided or he arrested.  He denied having  made the  statement attributed to him  by  Hipolito de la Cruz to the effect that he expected the game would be raided and that he would not be taken alive and  advising resistance to arrest.   He states  that while the game was going on peaceably he was suddenly seized by an unknown person,  who at the same time shot at him with a revolver; that the instant the revolver exploded a great uproar occurred and confusion reigned,  and that he did riot hear Hipolito de la Cruz say that he was a  policeman; that he did not know that the man who was assaulting him was a policeman until after the deceased had been shot.  He asserted that just prior to being assaulted, he  had received a considerable sum of  money  which had been wagered on the  game and that just as he was about to pay the money to the winner the assault was made upon him; that one hand was suddenly  seized and a revolver flashed  in his face;  that immediately  thereupon the  one who assaulted began to strike him in the face with  his revolver; that about  that time he felt himself seized from behind around the waist and at the same time he was confronted by another person  who rushed up, Seized him by the breast, and pointed a revolver at him; that, fearing  his  life was about  to be taken, he struck the revolver  to one side; that with the blow the revolver exploded, wounding the person who was holding him about the waist.   He sturdily maintains that he never had the revolver in his possession at all and that whatever resistance he made was made before he knew of the fact that the persons assaulting him were  policemen; that his resistance up to that time was made  entirely in self-defense; that he never for a moment had any intention of killing anyone, especially  a policeman; that he had a fighting bolo in his belt, which he  did not draw or  attempt  to draw from its sheath; that as soon as he knew that the persons assaulting him were  officers of the law he ceased resistance and went with them peaceably; that  he had no  intention  of resisting officers of the  law,  much  less assaulting  them, and  was acting, as he  honestly believed, in self-defense.<\/p>\n<p>The defendant also asserts that at the time the policeman was shot he, the wounded policeman, charged Joaquin Flores with being the cause of his injury, and that as they were removing  him from the room they besought him ibo charge that the defendant was the one who had shot him, and that he refused to do so.<\/p>\n<p>In this connection it is significant to note that immediately after the shot was fired the revolver was found in the possession of Joaquin Flores, one of the  policemen, who held it continuously  thereafter.  In other words, it is admitted in this case that Joaquin Flores had the revolver in his hands immediately before the shot vias fired and immediately after it was fired.   He  asserts in  explanation of this fact that the accused took the revolver away from him and fired the shot, immediately after which he, in turn, took it away from the accused.<\/p>\n<p>The testimony of the defendant as given in  this case is corroborated by that of his wife, of Alejandro Carpio and several other witnesses.<\/p>\n<p>We have, then, in this case, an old man, with a considerable sum of money intrusted to his care, suddenly assaulted and shot at by a stranger, who persisted in the assault by beating him over the head and face with his revolver; suddenly seized from the rear and made helpless by a second person, who appeared to be assisting in the assault already made; immediately confronted by a third person, a complete stranger, who seized him violently by the breast  and pointed a revolver point blank at his stomach; a sudden discharge of the revolver and the wounding  the person who held the old man by the waist; the possession of the revolver by the stranger immediately before its explosion and immediately after;  the information  thereupon given to the old man that the persons who had assaulted him were policemen; and his instant expression of willingness to  go with them.<\/p>\n<p>What does this condition of things reasonably indicate?<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li> It indicates that  while the policeman  Hipolito de la Cruz had a perfect  right to arrest the accused at that time and place he did arrest him he  was clearly in the wrong in the method which he  adopted  in making the arrest.  He himself admits that he said not a  word to the old man before he  seized him  and discharged his  revolver.   His words  are:<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I seized his hand that held the bottle and with the other I discharged my revolver  and said: 'Let  nobody move, because I am an officer.'\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>From his own statement it  might easily,  and probably naturally, be inferred  that he  made the assault and  fired the revolver before  he  made the statement that he  was an officer.  It is at least impossible to draw from his statement anything more favorable to his case than that the statement that he was an officer occurred simultaneously with his assault and the discharge of the firearm.   In either event it is more than likely that the accused did not hear what the policeman said.   He certainly could not have heard it if it was coincident with the discharge of the revolver and it is equally improbable that he  could have  heard it after the revolver was discharged, the reason being that confusion and uproar instantly followed, with people running here and there seeking to escape.  The policeman was clearly in the wrong and that wrong made it appear to the old man that he was being assaulted by strangers who intended to take his life and doubtless rob him of the money  that was then on  the  table.   To him it was an unprovoked and  deadly assault and he saw no remedy and no hope except in a stout resistance.  Joaquin Flores testified  that he did not tell the accused that he was a policeman yntil after the shot had been fired that  wounded  his  comrade.  The  dying declaration of Martin  N. Cruz, the policeman who was  shot, contains no mention as  to when,  if at all, the accused was notified that the persons who were assaulting,him were policemen. The fourth person, Alejandro Carpio, who accompanied the policemen as guide and who saw the events leading  up to the shooting of the policeman, corroborates the story of the accused in regard to this  point.  These facts indicate in the first place,  then, that although  the policemen had the right to arrest, they were guilty of gross misconduct  in the manner in which they sought to arrest the accused.   It is not intended by us to assert that the policemen did not have a right to make the arrests  at the  time and in  the  place they did.   The  point  to  which we call attention is the method in which it was done.  The manner of doing it led the appellant to believe, and naturally, that he  was being assaulted and not arrested.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li> These conditions indicate also  that  the  killing of the deceased was accidental and  occurred while the revolver was in the hands of Joaquin Flores.   This fact is positively asserted by the accused himself and is directly and  thoroughly corroborated by the testimony of Alejandro Carpio, who was the person who, on the order of the provincial governor, accompanied the policemen when they went to  make the raid and the arrests.  Both of them state that Flores pointed the revolver at the abdomen of the accused, who, fearing that he was about to be shot, struck it aside with his hand, at which it exploded and wounded the  deceased.  It is corroborated also by the fact, which is admitted in this case, that Joaquin Flores was found in  possession  of the revolver immediately after the discharge,.  The story of the accused as to the method in which the gun was discharged is also corroborated by the fact, undisputed in the record, that the  revolver was defective in its mechanism  and that, by reason of such defect, it was liable to explode at any time if at all roughly handled.  Moreover,  the story of the accused is far  more reasonable than  that  of the prosecution.   It seems more or less unreasonable to believe that an old man who  had been assaulted with a revolver by one policeman and seized from behind and held around the waist and arms by another, could still assault and take a revolver away from a third policeman  and with it shoot the person who was holding him,  when it  is conceded that  all three of the policemen were  strong and vigorous young men.   It  is also difficult to see just how  the accused could have shot the  deceased  in the manner in which  he is alleged to have done it.   With his arms fast at the elboy he could do nothing more than  use his forearms.  How he  could, when thus handicapped, snatch a revolver away from another policeman and  turn  and  shoot the  one who was holding him squarely in the navel  is difficult to  perceive. Moreover, it  should  be noted that the  direction of  the bullet was downward and toward the right.  Given  the position in which the accused is alleged to, have been at the time, the direction of the bullet would more probably be upward and toward the left, it being claimed by the prosecution that the policeman  when  shot was  at the left side of the accused.  The accused is also corroborated in this particular by the testimony of Geronimo Victoria, who as a witness stated that he heard a conversation between the  wounded policeman and one of his comrades while they were waiting at the presidencia for the coming  of the doctor  and  the justice of the peace, in which the wounded man asserted that Joaquin Flores was the person  who had shot him.  Nor is this story of the accused directly impugned by the dying declaration  of the deceased.  That declaration is  susceptible of one construction at least favorable to the accused. It is that,  although the  accused  succeeded  in  getting the revolver in his hands, it  went off accidentally and was not fired voluntarily and directly by the accused himself.  Said declaration is as follows:<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"STATEMENT  MADE BY THE DECEASED MARTIN N. CRUZ,  MUNICIPAL POLICEMAN OF CALUMPIT, THREE HOURS  BEFORE HIS  DEATH.<\/p>\n<p>\"I,  with  a commission from the provincial governor to apprehend  jueteng, games, went together with two fellow policemen and the governor's driver to a  place which was new to me.   We arrived at a small house in which it was said they were going to play jueteng.   Once inside  the house, ah old man  said: 'Be ready, because we are going to be caught and will have to fight.'   Then the old man shook the tambiolo vial and proceeded with the  drawing,  whereupon my companion Hipolito de la Cruz attempted to snatch the vial from the old man, but having failed in his attempt, the latter struck him on  the head with the vial.   Then the old man attempted  to seize the revolver which my companion Flores had, and once the weapon was in the former's hands it went off and the ball hit me.   Immediately after  the shot my  companion Flores snatched the revolver from the old man.  In the house there were many  men and  women with sickles.  This happened at 7.30 p. m., October 12,1909.<\/p>\n<p>\"The  accused Agustin  Clemente was presented  by  the justice of the peace to the deceased at the time the latter made his declaration, and was identified by him as the person who snatched the revolver from the policeman Flores on account of  which  the weapon went off and wounded  the deceased,                                  ;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p align=\"right\"> (Signed.)  \"R. DE LEON,<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p align=\"right\"><em>\"Justice of  the Peace.\"<\/em><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The prosecution, realizing  the  equivocal and  uncertain, character of the declaration, presented several witnesses to testify that the wording of the document was not in strict conformity with the  statements  of the deceased.   It is significant to  note that one of these witnesses, Ramon de Leon, the justice of the peace who  wrote the  declaration, taking it from the lips of the  deceased himself, testified as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Q. What were the questions that you put to the deceased and what were his answers in making this dying declaration?\u2014A. I refer you to the written declaration signed by him,\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The necessary  conclusion from  this answer is that the declaration was written precisely as it was given by the deceased.<\/p>\n<p>As we have already intimated, the policemen testified that just prior to the  drawing of the lucky ball from the glass bottle the accused paused long enough to make this statement:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I have a presentiment that this game is. going to be raided and I shall not be taken alive.   Take care you people who are intending to do this because  we are ready for anything.  Let him who is unable to fight go outside.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>This testimony is denied by the accused and his witnesses,  he  stating, and they  corroborating,  that  he had  no knowledge that any policemen were in the house as he had no expectation that the game  was going to be raided and that he, therefore, could have  had no reason whatever for making any such statement.<\/p>\n<p>It seems to us that this statement  of the policemen does not bear the marks of truth. The policemen took the greatest precaution to prevent  their  presence  being known. They disguised themselves, hid their badges beneath their camisas, and mixed quietly with the crowd.  It nowhere appears how the accused could have ascertained their presence.  But if  he had  known  of  it,  would  the course  of conduct described by the policemen have been reasonable? Would he have needlessly  and recklessly  exposed himself  to certain arrest and imprisonment?  Would he thus have warned the very men whom he was intending to kill that they  might the better  be prepared to resist him and his companions?   Would he thus have continued the game and thereby  freely given the policemen the very opportunity they  were seeking?  These questions have not been satisfactorily answered by the prosecution.  The story told by the accused and his witnesses is the more reasonable.  Besides, if the killing was accidental and was done while the revolver was in the hands of one of the policemen, it would not be exceedingly strange if those policemen, in an endeavor to exculpate themselves, should seek to place the  blame on other  shoulders.   If such were the case the testimony that the accused threatened to resist and assault them is easily explained.<\/p>\n<p>As to  the position of the prosecution that, although the evidence be held to be  not sufficient to convict of murder or homicide, nevertheless  there is evidence sufficient to convict of the crime of resisting officers  of  the law, we are convinced that it is not tenable under the record.   It is true that there is some evidence that, after the accused was fully informed of the fact that the persons whom he  supposed were  assaulting him were in  reality  policemen and were endeavoring  to effect  his  arrest, he  still  resisted their authority. But that evidence,  under all the circumstances, is not sufficiently clear,  or, if clear, not sufficiently reliable, to warrant a conviction.  It is  largely the testimony of Hipolito de la  Cruz upon which we would have to rely to support that conviction.  Under our holding that the accused is not guilty of the death of the deceased, the testimony of this witness is necessarily discredited.  In reaching that result we, in effect,  rejected substantially everything he said unfavorable to  the theory of  accidental homicide. With  that rejection went, very largely, his credibility.  At the very least, that rejection makes it extremely difficult for us, conscientiously,  to rest a conviction for any crime upon  any portion of his declaration.  This is especially so when we recall the other evidence in the case.  The defendant denies resistance, or even disobedience, after knowledge that the persons detaining him were policemen.   His witnesses corroborate  him.  It appears that, immediately  on the wounding of the deceased, the remaining policemen left the defendant to himself  and attended  to their  wounded companion, carrying him to one side and laying him down in  as  comfortable  a  position  as possible.   The  accused sought to  use  his temporary liberty neither to attack nor to flee.   He quietly  remained where he was until the policemen returned and took him to the <em>presidencia.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>We believe upon the whole case that there is a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.   (Supreme court of Spain, 13  April, 1901; 11 May, 1896; 19 October,  1895.)<\/p>\n<p>The judgment  of conviction is  hereby reversed and the accused acquitted.<\/p>\n<p><em> Torres, Johnson,  Carson,<\/em> and  <em>Trent, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<br\/>\n<\/p>\n<\/div>",

Taking into consideration all the circumstances of the case, we are satisfied that the offenders thoroughly understood the gravity of the crime committed by them when they made the assault upon their defenseless and unsuspecting victim; and we have no reason to believe that the\u00a0 crime committed by them was prompted by peculiar tribal customs\u00a0 or ancient traditions of their race, which might have led them to believe that the act committed by them was not in violation of the known laws of the community wherein they resided.\u00a0 Indeed, it is very clear that\u00a0 the commission\u00a0 of the crime had its origin solely in cupidity, and that the criminals were actuated by no other\u00a0 motive than a\u00a0 desire to possess the pistol\u00a0 of their victim, in\u00a0 utter disregard of the value of human life.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 The penalty prescribed for the commission of the\u00a0 crime of robbery\u00a0 with\u00a0 homicide is\u00a0 either life imprisonment or death.\u00a0 The commission of the offense being marked with one grave aggravating circumstance and\u00a0 no\u00a0 extenuating circumstances,\u00a0 the\u00a0 penalty\u00a0 prescribed\u00a0 was properly imposed in its maximum\u00a0 degree by the trial court.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>The sentence of death imposed by the trial judge upon both and each of the defendants should therefore be, and is hereby, affirmed,\u00a0 with\u00a0 the costs of this instance against the defendants.\u00a0 So ordered.<\/p><p><em>Arellano,\u00a0 C.

The policemen called upon the secret service agents to give an\u00a0 account of themselves, and to\u00a0 explain their suspicious conduct, and\u00a0 at the same time demanded that they produce their cedulas.\u00a0 This the secret service agents were unable to do, claiming that they had forgotten them in the neighboring\u00a0 town\u00a0 of\u00a0\u00a0 Calamba.\u00a0 They\u00a0 undertook\u00a0 to\u00a0 identify themselves by producing\u00a0 certain documents in English to show just\u00a0 what was their business.\u00a0 The police officers, who did not know\u00a0 English, were unable to read\u00a0 these documents, and believing that their conduct and their inability satisfactorily to account for themselves justified the suspicion\u00a0 that they\u00a0 were in some way\u00a0 connected with\u00a0 the recent robberies, or that they were about to commit theft or robbery, placed\u00a0 the two men under arrest and took them forthwith to the house of the justice of the peace informing them that the justice of the peace\u00a0 would be able to understand the documents produced by them and to decide what was proper to do under all the circumstances. The justice of the peace\u00a0 came down from his\u00a0 house, glanced over the papers,\u00a0 and without further attempt\u00a0 to verify the truth of the claims of the secret service\u00a0 agents, ordered them to be taken to the municipal jail and there to be searched and detained until further orders.\u00a0\u00a0 The justice of the peace, at the trial, denied that he had given any order directing their detention, but we\u00a0 think the\u00a0 evidence conclusively establishes\u00a0 not only that he did so, but that the order was issued\u00a0 by him without making any effort\u00a0 to\u00a0 verify\u00a0 the truth of the claims of the secret service agents, and without\u00a0 giving\u00a0 them\u00a0 any reasonable opportunity to\u00a0 explain their suspicious conduct or to\u00a0 produce evidence to relieve themselves of the suspicions aroused by their peculiar conduct\u00a0 in\u00a0 and about the market place.\u00a0 Indeed, the proof shows that\u00a0 he apparently wholly failed to appreciate the obligation which rested upon\u00a0 him to make a reasonable attempt\u00a0 to satisfy himself as to the grounds upon which the suspicions of the policemen were based, before issuing a\u00a0 judicial order for the detention of the men arrested by the policemen.<\/p><p> So far as the conduct of the\u00a0 two policemen is concerned, we are wholly unable to agree with the trial judge that there was anything reprehensible in their action in making the arrest, and certain it is that in view of the facts above set out a criminal\u00a0 charge of <em>detencion arbitraria <\/em>cannot be maintained against them.<\/p><p> In\u00a0 a former case we held that officials in\u00a0 these Islands, who,\u00a0 \"by direct provisions of\u00a0 law or by appointment of competent authority are charged with the maintenance of public order and the protection\u00a0 and security of life and property,\" have authority to make arrests without warrant substantially similar to the authority generally conferred upon \"peace officers\" in the United States,\u00a0 and\u00a0 more especially that class of \"peace officers\" known to American and\u00a0 English law as <em>constables<\/em>;\u00a0 and that \"the provisions of section 37 of Act No. 183\" (the Charter of Manila) \"quite clearly set forth the\u00a0 powers usually conferred by American and English law upon 'peace officers' including 'constables' in making arrests without warrants,\" and provide that they \"may pursue and arrest without\u00a0 warrant,\u00a0 any person found in suspicious places or under suspicious circumstances, reasonably tending to show that such person has committed or is about to commit any crime or breach of the peace; may arrest, or cause to be\u00a0 arrested without warrant, any offender,\u00a0 when the offense is\u00a0 committed in the presence of a\u00a0 peace officer or within his view.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (U. S. <em>vs<\/em>. Fortaleza, 12 Phil. Rep.,\u00a0 472, 479.)<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>In the light of after events\u00a0 it is of course very clear that the suspicion directed against the secret service agents was not well founded; but viewing the facts as they must have presented themselves to the woman who complained to the policemen,\u00a0 and to\u00a0 the policemen themselves, at the time of the\u00a0 arrest, we think that\u00a0 they\u00a0 must be\u00a0 held to have had\u00a0 reasonable grounds upon which\u00a0 to\u00a0 base their suspicions as to the arrested\u00a0 men.\u00a0 One\u00a0 readily sees that the\u00a0 conduct\u00a0 of\u00a0 these secret\u00a0 service agents, engaged, as presumably they were, in an attempt to surprise violators of\u00a0 the\u00a0 Internal\u00a0 Revenue\u00a0 Law,\u00a0 might well give\u00a0 rise to suspicions as to their real object and intentions in the mind of one who was not advised as to the real object which they had in\u00a0 view; and their inability satisfactorily to\u00a0 account for themselves and to\u00a0 produce\u00a0 their cedulas undoubtedly tended to confirm the suspicions already aroused.<\/p><p> We must not be understood,\u00a0 however, as holding that under the law as it now exists the mere fact that a citizen is unable to produce his\u00a0 cedula\u00a0 upon demand\u00a0 would in itself justify his arrest and detention without a warrant. There is no authority in law for\u00a0 the making of such arrests upon such grounds.\u00a0 But the conduct of these strangers in a frroyincial town in these Islands having already aroused the suspicion that they may have been guilty of a grave offense\u00a0 or were\u00a0 about to\u00a0 commit one, their failure or inability to produce\u00a0 their cedulas, or to satisfactorily account for their failure so to\u00a0 do, naturally impressed the local policemen as\u00a0 in some sort confirmatory\u00a0 of the\u00a0 suspicion already aroused.\u00a0\u00a0 The failure to produce their cedulas on demand was not\u00a0 in itself an offense, but in the minds of the two policemen in\u00a0 the case at\u00a0 bar it was\u00a0 undoubtedly calculated\u00a0 to confirm their suspicions already aroused.<\/p><p> Under all the\u00a0 circumstances we think that the action of the poiice officers\u00a0 in promptly bringing the suspected persons before the local judicial officer\u00a0 clearly\u00a0 indicated that, on their part, their acts were wholly inspired by a genuine desire to faithfully perform their duties\u00a0 as guardians of the law and of the good order of the community.\u00a0 And we conclude, therefore,\u00a0 that though the suspicions on\u00a0 which they based the arrest were not well founded, they are in no wise criminally responsible for their action in making the arrest; the facts, as they appeared to them at the time, having furnished reasonable grounds for their\u00a0 suspicions under all the circumstances.<\/p><p> But the facts as developed by the evidence of record do not in our opinion\u00a0 sustain\u00a0 the\u00a0 defense\u00a0 offered by Jose Batallones,\u00a0 the justice\u00a0 of\u00a0 the peace,\u00a0 and wholly fail to justify his conduct in arbitrarily issuing the order for the confinement\u00a0 of the\u00a0 suspected secret service agents.\u00a0 He himself denied that he had directed that they be detained, but we think that the evidence of record shows conclusively that he did in fact issue a verbal order to that effect.\u00a0 Indeed, the suspected persons having been brought before him by the police officers, it would seem that\u00a0 it was his duty as the local judicial officer, either to order their discharge or to direct that they be detained.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 The suspected\u00a0 persons were brought before him about 6 or 7 o'clock in the evening at his own house.\u00a0 There was plenty of opportunity for the verification of their claim that they were not suspicious characters, and that such suspicion as might have arisen in the minds of the policemen and of the\u00a0 woman who complained against them was founded upon acts the meaning of which was satisfactorily explained by the fact that they were engaged in the performance of their duties as secret service agents.\u00a0\u00a0 The papers in their possession, had they been examined carefully by the justice of the peace, who is presumably a man of some intelligence and education, were entirely sufficient to dispel any doubt as to the true character of these men.\u00a0 The testimony of the justice of the peace himself would seem to\u00a0 indicate that he was able to understand\u00a0 the\u00a0 contents of these\u00a0 documents; and even if the fact that they were prepared in English rendered them unintelligible to him,\u00a0 he could easily\u00a0 have verified the nature of their contents with the aid\u00a0 of one or other of\u00a0 the local officials or of some other person in the\u00a0 municipality who could read English.\u00a0 As a matter of fact, the municipal treasurer on the following morning secured the prompt discharge of the prisoners by furnishing information as to their status and employment.\u00a0 The justice of the peace made no effort whatever to verify the grounds upon which the police officers based their arrest, but arbitrarily and without investigation, without taking any evidence or making any effort\u00a0 to verify the\u00a0 claims of\u00a0 the arrested persons, issued his judicial order for their detention, and we are satisfied that in doing so he acted without reasonable grounds upon which to base his action.\u00a0\u00a0 If\u00a0 the police officers were to make the arrests at all, it was necessary for\u00a0 them to\u00a0 act promptly upon\u00a0 such information as they had at hand; but there was no such urgent necessity upon the part of the justice of the peace to order the continued detention of the arrested persons without\u00a0 making some investigation.\u00a0 Indeed, he seems to have acted\u00a0 without the\u00a0 slightest\u00a0 regard\u00a0 to his obligations as a judicial officer or to the rights of the arrested persons to be set at liberty in the absence of reasonable grounds for their\u00a0 detention.\u00a0\u00a0 No reason suggests\u00a0 itself why,\u00a0 at the hour at which they were brought before him, he could not have at least made some effort to verify the truth of their claims.<\/p><p> There is no ground for the belief that in\u00a0 acting as he did, the justice\u00a0 of the peace was actuated by any special malice or illwill toward the prisoners, and the only explanation\u00a0 of his\u00a0 conduct is that he\u00a0 was willfully negligent of their rights, and willing arbitrarily to detain them rather than to take any trouble to verify their claims.<\/p><p> We think the judgment\u00a0 of conviction of the trial court should be affirmed, but we think that the fine, imposed by the trial court in\u00a0 its maximum degree, should be reduced from the sum of 3,250 pesetas to 325 pesetas.<\/p><p> The judgment of conviction, together with the sentences imposed by the\u00a0 trial court in the cases of the appellants Maximo Cuadro and Isaac Demo, is hereby\u00a0 reversed, and these appellants are hereby acquitted of the crime\u00a0 with which they are charged, and, if in detention, will be set at liberty forthwith; if\u00a0 at\u00a0 liberty under\u00a0 bail, their bond is hereby exonerated.<\/p><p> The judgment of conviction of the appellant Jose Batallones is affirmed, but the sentence imposed upon him should be, and is hereby modified by substituting for the fine imposed by the trial court,\u00a0 a fine of 325 pesetas,\u00a0 with subsidiary imprisonment\u00a0 in accordance\u00a0 with law, in the event of insolvency and failure to pay the\u00a0 fine.\u00a0 One-third of the costs of these proceedings in the trial court will be taxed to this defendant.\u00a0 All\u00a0 other costs are hereby\u00a0 declared\u00a0 de oficio.\u00a0 So ordered.<\/p><p><em>Arellano, C.

It appears from the evidence that the child was 8 years of age and lived with her mother, Irene Filipino, in one of the outlying <i>barrios<\/i> of the city of Iloilo. The defendant, who was 23 years old, was a water carrier from whom the mother of the girl was accustomed to buy water. On the morning of September 22, 1910, according to his daily custom he delivered water at her home. He remained there some little time according to the testimony of the mother, who said that he had been there about an hour before she went to the market leaving the defendant and her daughter in the house alone. According to the testimony of the child, Rosa Gabasa, the defendant made indecent proposals to her after the mother left the house, and afterwards he laid her down upon the floor, where he held her and accomplished his desire. The child did not report these facts to her mother when she returned, but two days later the mother noticed that there was something wrong with the girl, and after making an examination of her private parts discovered a swollen and unnatural condition. The child then told her mother that the defendant had held her on the floor and had had sexual intercourse with her. Doctor Mapa, a physician, was called in and made a more detailed examination. He testified that the exterior parts of the female organs were badly swollen, that the membrane of the vaginal duct was lacerated, and that the child was suffering from the disease of gonorrhea. The defendant was arrested, and upon being stripped by the chief of police he was found to be infected with that disease; he was also examined by Doctor Mapa who testified that he had a chronic case of gonorrhea. The defendant himself admitted that he had the disease and had been troubled with it for a number of years. He did not deny that he was at the house on the morning during which the crime is charged to have been committed; but he denied all the facts which tend to connect him directly with the crime of rape. The record discloses a number of inconsistencies and contradictions in his statements which cast a cloud of doubt and suspicion upon all his testimony. The testimony of the witnesses for the Government is not wholly free from criticism, but we think that the inconsistencies and minor contradictions therein, to which our attention is directed by counsel, are not vital to the issues involved and do not substantially weaken the case as made out by the prosecution.<br\/><br\/>There can be no doubt from the record before us that the child had been the subject of some man's brutal passion; the lacerated and swollen condition of her vaginal duct and the adjacent exterior parts are proof conclusive upon this point. The further fact that she was suffering from a venereal disease of the same character as that with which the defendant was afflicted, in some sort corroborates the story of the crime as detailed by the injured child, Rosa Gabasa. We are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the record fully establishes the guilt of the accused, and we find no error in the proceedings prejudicial to the rights of the appellant.<br\/><br\/>We find no error in the fact that the court below applied the penalty provided in such cases in its maximum degree. No less penalty would fit the brutal and abominable crime with which appellant was convicted. The trial judge considered the abuse of confidence as an aggravating circumstance attendant on the commission of the crime. The man was a water carrier and as such had access to the house; he frequently remained for a friendly chat after delivering his water. On the morning in question he was left in the house with the child while the mother went to market. The trial judge was of opinion that these facts are sufficient to support a finding that the commission of the crime was marked with the aggravating circumstance of abuse of confidence as defined in the code. This view is vigorously combatted, but we do not deem it necessary to consider or decide the nice questions involved, because there can be no doubt that the crime was committed \"in the house of the offended party,\" and this fact unquestionably constitutes the aggravating circumstance defined in subsection 20 of article 10 of the Penal Code, and justifies and requires the imposition of the penalty in its maximum degree, there being no extenuating circumstances to modify or qualify the com- mission of the crime. (U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Cruz, 1 Phil. Rep., 734.)<br\/><br\/>The judgment of conviction and the sentence of twenty years <i>reclusion temporal<\/i> with the accessory penalties imposed by the trial court should be and are hereby affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

The officers of the volunteers spend their earlier days wit knowledge of military law,\u00a0 preparing for agriculture, mechanical, mercantile or professional\u00a0 pursuits, unaccustomed to military\u00a0 discipline, and ex from\u00a0 the controlling commands of superiors.\u00a0 The officers of the Reg Army make the discipline of that army, the preparation for war, and\u00a0 wa itself the work of their lives.\u00a0\u00a0 Their hopes and\u00a0 their\u00a0 aspirations excel\u00a0 in\u00a0 this,\u00a0 their\u00a0 chosen profession, and upon it they rely for t livelihood.\u00a0 The officers\u00a0 of the volunteers look to civil\u00a0 pursuits fo ultimate success and sustenance.\u00a0 They leave these pursuits for a few s months at the call of their country to subdue a rebellion against\u00a0 or t defeat an enemy of their nation. They\u00a0 seek not so much to discipline t army they join, and to prepare it for war, as\u00a0 to speedily conclude the restore\u00a0 peace, and return to their chosen pursuits.\u00a0\u00a0 Their hopes and aspirations center, not in their temporary occupation, but in\u00a0 the\u00a0 pursuits they\u00a0 have left, and to which they are soon to\u00a0 return.\u00a0 More than\u00a0 all the officers of the Regular Army know the unwritten code of military thought and action, and the\u00a0 habit of the trained soldier's life, and k them so well that their practice is\u00a0 involuntary, while a neglect of the seems inexcusable.\u00a0\u00a0 The officers of the volunteer force come to the army in ignorance of this code and custom.\u00a0\u00a0 They have short time to learn o to practice them.\u00a0\u00a0 Their invariable practice does\u00a0 not always seem to essential to the defeat of the enemy and a speedy peace, and the heinousness of a disregard of some of their requirements\u00a0 does not alwa impress' them.\u00a0\u00a0 So it is that the thoughts, actions, habits, and ambit the officers of the Regular Army differ widely from those of the volunteer Many\u00a0 things in the life of the soldier\u00a0 seem\u00a0 vital to the former that small importance in the eyes\u00a0 of the latter. Many\u00a0 military offenses seem heinous\u00a0 to the\u00a0 former that appear venal to the latter\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The\u00a0 decision in McClaughry <em>vs.<\/em>\u00a0 Deming was based upon (1)\u00a0 the provisions of law which prohibited the trial of members of the Voluntee Army by courts-martial composed of Regular Army officers, and (2) an exposition of the reasons underlying such legislation.\u00a0 The law\u00a0 application that case, as remarked by Judge Sanborn, was\u00a0 so plain that \"the question does not seem difficult, nor the true answer to it doubtful.\"\u00a0\u00a0 As so admirably set forth in his\u00a0 decision, the whole\u00a0 trend\u00a0 of legislation, decision, and\u00a0 practice has been to sharply distinguish between the Reg Army and the militia or volunteers in the matter of courts-martial. The question raised by the petitioner is, we believe, an open one as\u00a0 to the courts.\u00a0\u00a0 We have attempted to show that both the legislative and executive branches\u00a0 of the\u00a0 Government have ruled that the organization to which petitioner belonged is a part of the Regular\u00a0 Army,\u00a0\u00a0 In the quotation from McClaughry vs. Deming (<em>supra<\/em>) are set forth many cogent reasons for the position taken\u00a0 in that case.\u00a0 The officer of the Regular Army, because of his totally different conception of military s is shown to be\u00a0 unfit to sit\u00a0 in judgment upon the offenses of the Volunteer Army officer.\u00a0 Military service is the vocation of the one, avocation\u00a0 of the other. To the one obedience to orders\u00a0 is\u00a0 an end; to the\u00a0 other a means to an end.\u00a0 The one realizes the full significance o soldier's creed; the other is handicapped by his unfamiliarity with that creed. These are some of the potent arguments which impelled the various departments of the Government to recognize the unjustness and impracticability of allowing officers of the Regular Army to sit on court martial for the trial of Volunteer Army officers.\u00a0 In the case at bar, advances an\u00a0 ingenious interpretation of the law which will exclude the Philippine Scouts from the Regular Army, classify them as \"other force within, the\u00a0 meaning of\u00a0 the Seventy-seventh Article of War, and free h client from a prison sentence.\u00a0 His only argument in support of this proposition\u00a0 is the technical one that the law so reads.\u00a0\u00a0 Were such the ca that reason\u00a0 alone would be sufficient for us to acquiesce in\u00a0 that interpretation of\u00a0 the law.\u00a0 It would be unnecessary nor would we ask o seek for other reasons for supporting counsel's contention.\u00a0 But counsel interpretation of the law is at best a doubtful one.\u00a0\u00a0 Laws are, as a r based upon reason and justice.\u00a0 The underlying principle of a law, the motives of the legislature in enacting it, and the effect of its practice operation, are\u00a0 all matters properly to\u00a0 be considered\u00a0 where its\u00a0 language is so\u00a0 far ambiguous as to require the application of judicial rules of construction\u00a0 and interpretation.\u00a0\u00a0 Counsel\u00a0 has invited our attention of these\u00a0 matters\u00a0 but he has cited the case of Deming <em>vs<\/em>. McClaughry Are the underlying principles of that case\u00a0 applicable to the petitioner.\u00a0 The Philippine Scouts, on their organization, were officere above the of first lieutenant by officers of the Regular Army.\u00a0 Its staff officer first and second lieutenants were selected from non-commissioned officer enlisted men of the\u00a0 Regular Army with not less than two years' service by members of the volunteer army who had served subsequent to a specified date.\u00a0 The Articles of War and the regulations governing th Regular Army were applicable to the Scouts from the outset and are stil applicable.\u00a0\u00a0 The same drill regulations are used by both forces.\u00a0\u00a0 The equipment of the two forces is very similar.\u00a0 They are paid from a comm fund by\u00a0 the\u00a0 same\u00a0 force of\u00a0 paymasters.\u00a0\u00a0 (33 Stats.\u00a0 L., 259.) Those enlisted men of the Regular Army who become officers of the Philippine Scouts receive credit for such service on the same basis as if they were serving in the Regular Army in computing the date of their retirement f the service. Counsel states that the petitioner himself served as private corporal,\u00a0 and sergeant in Company B of\u00a0 the\u00a0 Twentieth United States Infantry.\u00a0 With all these points in common, can it be said\u00a0 that a diff or higher conception of discipline or duty prevails in the one organization than in the\u00a0 other?\u00a0\u00a0 Is\u00a0 it reasonable to presume\u00a0 that\u00a0 the commanding officers of the Scouts, fresh from their experience in the Army and tea the\u00a0 same\u00a0 regulations to their troops that they themselves were\u00a0 taught respect and obey, will place a different\u00a0 or laxer\u00a0 interpretation upon regulations\u00a0 in their new positions?\u00a0 Such\u00a0 a presumption can\u00a0 not be indulged in.\u00a0 The discipline is\u00a0 the same,\u00a0 and the punishments for disobedience are the same,\u00a0\u00a0 No officer of the Scout organization can consistently plead his ignorance of\u00a0 or unfamiliarity with the strict m code when he comes\u00a0 from the organization\u00a0 which has developed and carried into practice that code which he was trained to obey long before he entered upon his duties as a Scout officer, and which, in his new postion he is obliged to respect and enforce.\u00a0\u00a0 The reason of the rule promulgation by\u00a0 article 77 of the Articles of War, so ably expounded by Judge Sanborn, is not applicable to the Philippine Scouts.\u00a0\u00a0 The Philippine S a part of the Regular Army of the United States.

He had created no enemies by any personal action or omission\u00a0 on his part.\u00a0 About 8 o'colck on the night of May 15,1909, Father Baltanas was in the house of Gregorio Pudanca, a friend of his.\u00a0 The house of Pudanca was situated a short distance diagonally across the plaza from the convent in which Baltanas lived.\u00a0 As was the custom, the church bell rang at 8 o'clock and the priest left the house of Pudanca and returned to the convent.\u00a0 He entered the main door to the lower portion of the convent, and while in the space between that door and the stairs leading to the upper portion of the building, someone struck him a blow with\u00a0 a bolo or sharp cutting instrument, which cut through his priestly cap and\u00a0 inflicted a wound\u00a0 on his head 8 inches in length, extending from the left eye to beyond the ear on the same side, the skull being fractured the entire length of the cut. After receiving this severe blow, the priest managed to make his way upstairs to his room.\u00a0\u00a0 His clerk and a servant, who were in the convent at the time, gave the alarm by calling for the police.\u00a0 This alarm was given about fifteen or twenty minutes\u00a0 after the priest had left the house of Pudanca. Several persons went to the convent and remained with the priest\u00a0 until his death,\u00a0 which\u00a0 occurred\u00a0 as a direct result of said wound at about 5 o'clock on the next morning, May 16. The foregoing facts stand undisputed.<\/p><p>In\u00a0 1904,\u00a0 litigation arose between\u00a0 the\u00a0 Roman\u00a0 Catholic Church and the municipality of Escalante relative to\u00a0 certain properties in that town.\u00a0\u00a0 Gil Gamao, one of the appellants, then a member of the Aglipayan\u00a0 Church and a councilman, took a prominent part in naving the municipality contest the claim of the Catholic Church to this property. He acquired\u00a0 a hatred\u00a0 toward this church, its priest, representatives,\u00a0 and the members of the friar orders.\u00a0 The litigation over the property in question\u00a0 came before this Supreme Court, where it was held that the property belonged to the Catholic Church.\u00a0 The judgment thus rendered was returned to the municipality of Escalante for execution, and on the forenoon of May 15, 1909, said judgment was read at a session of the municipal council.\u00a0\u00a0 These facts are\u00a0 not seriously disputed.<\/p><p>The\u00a0 record before us\u00a0 clearly shows that the\u00a0 killing\u00a0 of Father Baltanas was brought about through hatred of and in a spirit of revenge against that which\u00a0 he represented in nationality and profession; that is, because he was a Spaniard, a member of a friar order, and a priest of the Roman Catholic Church.<\/p><p>On May 20, five days after the murder of Baltanas,\u00a0 the Constabulary\u00a0 officer detailed, to\u00a0 investigate the\u00a0 murder, finding that certain circumstances pointed to the appellant Mauricio Gamao as its author, but not having sufficient evidence,\u00a0 in his\u00a0 opinion, to justify charging Mauricio with its commission, caused his arrest on a charge of carrying concealed\u00a0 weapons.\u00a0 On May 24, Mauricio was bound over to the Court of First Instance on this charge.\u00a0 On the 26th, he was transferred from the municipal jail at Escalante to the custody of the Constabulary.\u00a0 On the next day,\u00a0 May 27, Mauricio made a formal statement implicating in the murder of the priest his uncle, Gil Gamao, and others of the defendants named in the information, but exculpating himself, which statement constituted\u00a0 the basis of a complaint, duly attested\u00a0 and sworn to by him, upon which\u00a0 his codefendants were arrested and remanded on the\u00a0 31st of that month to the\u00a0 Court of First Instance for trial.\u00a0 After Mauricio had been transferred to Bacolod, a complaint was filed by the provincial fiscal before the justice of the peace of the capital,\u00a0 charging\u00a0 him also with the murder, upon\u00a0 which latter complaint he was\u00a0 bound over to answer the same charge that he had made against his codefendants.<\/p><p>The claim of the prosecution, as alleged in the information, is that the blow that caused the death of Father Baltanas was struck by the appellant Mauricio Gamao, and that in committing the deed he was instigated by his codefendants and was carrying out the directions given to him by them in\u00a0 pursuance of an agreement entered into\u00a0 by all of the defendants jointly at the\u00a0 house of Gil Gamao a few hours. prior to the commission of the deed.<\/p><p>The defense in the court below was an alibi on the part of all the defendants save\u00a0 Gil Gamao,\u00a0 who admitted that he was at home on the afternoon in question, but claimed that he was confined to his bed\u00a0 by paralysis, and that no meeting was held as alleged by the prosecution.<\/p><p>The lower court found\u00a0 that the deed was committed\u00a0 by the defendant Mauricio Gamao upon the procurement of his uncle Gil.\u00a0 Also that five\u00a0 of their\u00a0 codef endants were present\u00a0 in the house of Gil Gamao on the afternoon\u00a0 of May 15th when Gil Gamao persuaded his nephew Mauricio\u00a0 to do the deed.\u00a0 All of the defendants except Gil\u00a0 and Mauricio Gamao, were acquitted on the ground that Gil Gamao was the\u00a0 only one who\u00a0 actually influenced Mauricio to\u00a0 murder the priest.\u00a0\u00a0 The trial court was not convinced that the other five\u00a0 defendants, though\u00a0 present when the\u00a0 murder\u00a0 was agreed upon and consenting thereto,\u00a0 were factors in persuading the murderer to commit the crime.<\/p><p>It is strongly urged that the prosecution has failed\u00a0 to establish the guilt of the\u00a0 appellants\u00a0 with such a degree of certainty as to justify a conviction.<\/p><p>The authors of the murder of the priest were unknown from the 15th to the 27th of May, when, on this latter date, Mauricio Gamao made\u00a0 certain\u00a0 disclosures which caused the arrest of his codefendants.\u00a0\u00a0 On that morning, the lieutenant of Constabulary received word from his guard that Mauricio wanted to\u00a0 make a statement.\u00a0 On\u00a0 ascertaining that\u00a0 his proposed\u00a0 statement\u00a0 had nothing to do with the charge under which he was then detained, but related to the murder of the priest,\u00a0 the Constabulary officer sent for the justice of\u00a0 the peace,\u00a0 Pedro Amante, with whom Mauricio said\u00a0 he desired a conference.\u00a0 Pending the\u00a0 arrival of the justice of the peace, Francisco Ferrer, a Spanish resident of Escalante, had an interview with Mauricio in which Mauricio told him that he did not want to suffer the fate of Pedro Git\u00a0 (an Escalante\u00a0 man hanged for an assassination\u00a0 committed by the procurement of others\u00a0 3 Phil. Rep., 414), and that he wished to tell everything he knew.\u00a0 Ferrer testified:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"He told me that at a meeting he was offered money to kill\u00a0 the <em>padre<\/em>\u00a0 and that he would\u00a0 not\u00a0 accept it, but Jose Patpat did, and that they came to the convent about eight o'clock P.\u00a0 M. and\u00a0 that when the padre passed\u00a0 he (JosS) delivered a blow to\u00a0 the <em>padre.<\/em>\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Upon his arrival at\u00a0 the convent, the justice of the peace asked Mauricio if he desired\u00a0 to make a statement to him and\u00a0 was answered\u00a0 in the affirmative.\u00a0 After having heard his statement, Mr. Amante requested Mauricio to repeat it, which was done, the justice of the peace meanwhile transcribing it in the form of a complaint.\u00a0 The complaint being thus prepared,\u00a0 the justice of the peace read it to Mauricio in Visayan, whereupon the latter made oatty to and signed the same with a cross attested by his thumbmafk.\u00a0 These proceedings were had in the presence of the witnesses Lieutenant Lough of\u00a0 the Constabulary, Francisco Ferrer, and Vicente Olmedo, each\u00a0 of whom, as well as the\u00a0 justice of the peace, testified to the fact that the statement was voluntary and upon the initiative of Mauricio himself.\u00a0 Olmedo also\u00a0 testified that he\u00a0 heard\u00a0 Mauricio say to one\u00a0 of\u00a0 the soldiers who had charge of\u00a0 him, \"If I am going to be taken alone to Bacolod, I might as well state everything.\"\u00a0 In this complaint, Mauricio implicated all of the seven defendants in the murder of the priest except himself and Rufino Pineda.\u00a0 In\u00a0 place of\u00a0 himself and Pineda he substituted the names of Domingo\u00a0 Jaime and Jose Ilongo (Jose Patpat). Two days later, May 29,\u00a0 the\u00a0 justice of\u00a0 the\u00a0 peace\u00a0 again examined Mauricio\u00a0 as\u00a0 to\u00a0 the\u00a0 facts sworn\u00a0 to\u00a0 by him on May 27th, and the latter ratified his previous statements.<\/p><p>At the trial in the Court of First Instance, Mauricio, on testifying in behalf of himself and his codefendants, sought to explain away his action\u00a0 in thus\u00a0 making the\u00a0 original complaint against his codefendants.\u00a0\u00a0 He admits,\u00a0 however, the genuineness of his thumbmark attached to the complaint of May 27, but claims that the document to which he affixed his thumbmark was never read to him and that he\u00a0 supposed it was an order for his\u00a0 release.<\/p><p>Dolores Labida [Labadia], a\u00a0 widow, and who, as <em>querida<\/em> of Mauricio Gamao, resided with him, after having given an account of what she\u00a0 claims to have accidently overheard at the house of Gil Gamao on the\u00a0 afternoon of May 15th, testified that upon\u00a0 the\u00a0 return of Mauricio to their house the next morning\u00a0 he admitted to her that the crime which she had\u00a0 heard Gil Gamao direct him to\u00a0 commit was already done, and in response to her question as to why he did it, answered: \"What am I going to do?\u00a0 <em>Manong<\/em> [referring to his uncle Gil Gamao]\u00a0 ordered me to do it.\"\u00a0 This witness (Labida) [Labadia]\u00a0 further testified that after Mauricio's codefendants had.been arrested, she visited Mauricio at the convent where he was confined under a Constabulary guard, as she had previously done at the municipal jail;\u00a0 and that he there said to her:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"If they make you testify to the truth, you testify to the whole\u00a0 truth, as I have done already;\u00a0 so, regarding the killing of the priest, two of us killed the priest, and Jose was\u00a0 my companion.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Also that Mauricio had\u00a0 stated to\u00a0 her that he had told the whole truth\u00a0 because he was the first one to be. made to suffer, and he would tell the\u00a0 whole truth so that all ihe rest\u00a0 would suffer with\u00a0 him\u00a0 those who ordered him and directed\u00a0 him to commit the crime.\u00a0\u00a0 This witness further says:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"Mauricio stated that\u00a0 the one who waited for the arrival of the priest at the stairway was Jose and he was the one who killed the priest, and that he (Mauricio)\u00a0 waited at the doorway at the side of the convent.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Again, this witness testified that after the accused Pineda had been arrested and placed in confinement with Mauricio and as her testimony was about to be taken on the charge sworn to by Mauricio, the latter asked her not to testify to what he had previously told her,\u00a0 and that Pineda\u00a0 then stated to her: \"Yes, Dolores, do not testify to\u00a0 that.\u00a0 Would not you pity your husband if he should be placed\u00a0 in sorrow?\"<\/p><p>Felicidad Mij ares, a fifteen-year old daughter of Dolores Labida [Labadia] testified that between five and six o'clock on the afternoon of Saturday, May 15th, while her mother was absent, Mauricio came to the house and immediately proceeded to\u00a0 sharpen a long bob which\u00a0 he was accustomed to carry when\u00a0 he went\u00a0 fishing;\u00a0 that after\u00a0 sharpening the bob Mauricio left the house, taking the bob\u00a0 with him; and that on\u00a0 leaving the house Mauricio wore gray knee trousers, a white undershirt, and a salacot\u00a0 (native hat). The bolo referred to by Felicidad Mi j ares was subsequently found in Mauricio's house and specifically identified.\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>Domingo Jaime was one of six buzos in the employ of Gil Gamao, who, between eight and nine o'clock on the night of the murder, transferred a load of corn from the seashore where they\u00a0 had landed from a boat,\u00a0 to the camarin in the rear of Gil Gamao's house.\u00a0 This witness carried the last load of\u00a0 corn from the cart to\u00a0 the camarin.\u00a0 As he passed near\u00a0 the steps\u00a0 at the side\u00a0 of\u00a0 Gil Gamao's house he testified that he recognized\u00a0 the voice of captain Gil as the latter said: \"What of you, Mauricio?\" and then the voice of Mauricio in reply: \"The thing is done.\u00a0 The padre is dead.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Juan Batolinao, a former employee of Gil Gamao, stated that he began to work for Gil\u00a0 in the year 1904 and left him in March, 1907, and that the\u00a0 cause of his leaving was that Gil\u00a0 Gamao had endeavored to induce him to\u00a0 kill the then priest of Escalante.<\/p><p>Carlos Cabus, brother-in-law of Gil Gamao, testified that in March,\u00a0 1909, two months prior to the murder, Rufino Pineda approached him with the proposition that he (Cabus) contribute one hundred pesos to a fund to be used in hiring Mauricio to kill\u00a0 Father Baltanas, and that Pineda claimed that he made this proposition on\u00a0 behalf of\u00a0 Gil Gamao.<\/p><p>Jose Patpat testified that in the month of March,\u00a0 1909, while he was employed by Gil Gamao, the latter offered him P50 if he would kill the priest; that the offer was made at the\u00a0 house of Gil Gamao while he was stopping there\u00a0 for the night on his return from a trip to Iloilo in company with Luis\u00a0 Garcia, Gil's son-in-law; and that during this private conversation between\u00a0 himself and Gil, the latter displayed his anger because the witness and Domingo Jayme had called upon the Roman Catholic priest to perform\u00a0 the burial ceremonies on the occasion of the death of Domingo's brother.<\/p><p>Miguel Gamao, nephew of Gil Gamao, and president of Escalante at the time of the murder, testified that:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"On\u00a0 a day\u00a0 in the month\u00a0 of May,\u00a0 I do not\u00a0 remember\u00a0 the date, I heard captain Gil say that an anarchistic society had been formed with the\u00a0 object of killing the\u00a0 friars.\u00a0 If the municipal authorities should take part in the prosecution of these anarchists they would also be\u00a0 assassinated.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Pedro Amante, the justice of the peace, testified that\u00a0 the suit of the municipality of Escalante against the church was begun in the year 1904 or 1905, upon the motion of\u00a0 Gil Gamao, who was then a member of the municipal council; that at the meeting of the council on May 15, 1909, the secretary\u00a0 (Pineda) read part of the decree of the Supreme Court, and then threw the document on the table and at once left the room; that shortly\u00a0 afterwards about 12\u00a0 o'clock, he went to his house, which adjoined that of Gil Gamao, and from his window\u00a0 noticed Pineda in the kitchen of Gil's house; that on the way\u00a0 from the tribunal\u00a0 to his house he was preceded by Luis Garcia, son-in-law of Gil, who lived in Gil's house; that Luis entered Gil's\u00a0 house as he (the witness) entered his own; and that at about 3 o'clock that afternoon he saw Padre Sotero\u00a0 Cuenca,\u00a0 Aglipayan priest of Escalante, coming out of Gil Gamao's house.<\/p><p>With reference to\u00a0 the meeting which the prosecution claims took place in the house of Gil Gamao\u00a0 on the afternoon of May 15, Dolores Labida\u00a0 [Labadia] testified in substance as follows:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"About noon on Saturday, May 15, Mauricio came home and told me that he was going\u00a0 to town as Manong (Gil Gamao) had some work for him\u00a0 to do.\u00a0 Being out of corn, which we were accustomed to get from Manong, I insisted on accompanying Mauricio.\u00a0\u00a0 When we arrived at captain Gil's house, I\u00a0 noticed that Pineda entered just before\u00a0 us. On entering the house from the side door of the kitchen, I saw the defendants in this case sitting at a long table in the kitchen.\u00a0 After I had spoken to Gil about getting one thousand ears of corn I went to\u00a0 the camarin, accompanied by a\u00a0 servant of GiPs named Soria, who counted out\u00a0 the corn for me.\u00a0 After the corn was placed on the\u00a0 ground in a separate heap,\u00a0 a helper\u00a0 of mine proceeded to transfer it in lots of two hundred ears to\u00a0 our house, and during\u00a0 the interval between each load I seated myself on the doorstep on the side of the house next to the camarin, from\u00a0 whence I could watch the corn.\u00a0\u00a0 In this\u00a0 way I heard from\u00a0 time to time\u00a0 certain portions\u00a0 of conversation which was\u00a0 taking place\u00a0 between\u00a0 Gil Gamao and the six defendants\u00a0 sitting with him at the table, one of the six being Mauricio.\u00a0 I heard\u00a0 captain Gil say to the meeting that the way things were going they would never escape from the Romans, on whose account the revolution had started; to which Pineda and the Aglipayan padre responded that whatever\u00a0 captain Gil desired to do they would\u00a0 conform to.\u00a0 I heard\u00a0 captain Gil propose that Mauricio make\u00a0 away with the priest.\u00a0 In consideration therefor, he offered to release Mauricio from all of his indebtedness and give him\u00a0 'fifty more.'\u00a0\u00a0 Upon hearing this proposition, Mauricio expressed his\u00a0 fear of undertaking such work, but Gil\u00a0 reassured him by\u00a0 saying: 'I am here to\u00a0 answer for you.'\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Apolinaria Bayhonan\u00a0 testified that on the afternoon of May 15th she administered massage to Gil Gamao and that both on entering and leaving the house she saw Mauricio Gamao there, together with the other five defendants.<\/p><p>Serapia Fuente stated that\u00a0 she saw three of the defendants at Gil's house that afternoon.<\/p><p>Asuncion Alfan testified that on the afternoon of Saturday, May 15th, the 4glipayan priest and\u00a0 Segundo Canizares, the latter a brother-in-law of Gil Gamao, called at her house. Narciso Salgal, chief of police of Escalante and nephew of Gil Gamao, was there at the time, and after\u00a0 a brief private interview with the chief of police, the two\u00a0 left the house, going toward Gil's house.<\/p><p>As a witness in his own defense, Mauricio Gamao attempted to establish an alibi by claiming that he spent the afternoon of Saturday, May 15th, at the beach helping one Rufino\u00a0 Caporas repair fishnets,\u00a0 and that he\u00a0 did not get home that evening, but remained at\u00a0 the camarin all night. Rufino Gaporas, on behalf of Mauricio, testified to the same effect, claiming that he slept in the camarin\u00a0 with Mauricio and\u00a0 that on awaking Sunday morning they went out fishing together.\u00a0 On cross-examination, Mauricio admitted that he had\u00a0 previously stated to the fiscal that he had gone to the house of. one Carlos Cabus at four o'clock on Saturday afternoon and remained there until time\u00a0 to go out in the\u00a0 boat Sunday morning.\u00a0\u00a0 Gaporas also admitted on cross-examination\u00a0 that he was examined before the\u00a0 justice of the peace of Escalante, but denied that he there testified that he did not see Mauricio Gamao on the Saturday night of the murder. The\u00a0 justice\u00a0 of the peace,\u00a0 Mr. Amante, testified that he transcribed\u00a0 the questions and answers\u00a0 that were put to Rufino Caporas and that the latter stated before him\u00a0 that he spent the fifteenth of May at the beach, but that he did not\u00a0 see Mauricio Gamao\u00a0 there that day nor\u00a0 that\u00a0 night. The wife of Caporas testified that on the night of the murder she and her husband slept together\u00a0 in their house at the beach, and that no one else was\u00a0 there,\u00a0 and that she\u00a0 had since separated from her husband because he insisted upon\u00a0 her testifying as Gil Gamao wanted her to do.\u00a0 In surrebuttal, Rufino Caporas stated that his wife left him a week prior to\u00a0 the death of\u00a0 the priest.\u00a0 The prosecution then showed by\u00a0 the\u00a0 notes of the stenographer that this same witness had testified before\u00a0 the prosecuting attorney that his wife had not left him until after the\u00a0 priest had been murdered.<\/p><p>The evidence\u00a0 of the defense in support of the claim that no meeting\u00a0 was held in the house of Gil Gamao on the day of the murder\u00a0 and that Captain Gil himself was confined in his bed with paralysis consists of that of Mauricio Gamao and the following witnesses:<\/p><p>Inez Bais stated that she massaged Captain Gil on Saturday, the day of\u00a0 the murder, and that half of his\u00a0 body was paralyzed so that he was\u00a0 unable to leave his house.\u00a0 On cross-examination this\u00a0 witness\u00a0 denied that\u00a0 she had previously testified\u00a0 at Escalante that she had spent that Saturday in an outlying barrio and was not at Gil's house on that day.\u00a0 On rebuttal it was shown by the stenographer's notes of this witness' testimony that she did testify in the preliminary investigation conducted by Mr. Adams at Escalante, that she was not at the house of Gil on that Saturday.<\/p><p>Patricia Tenebroso, a 14-year old servant in the house of Gil Gamao,\u00a0 testified that he\u00a0 was unable to get out of\u00a0 his bed oh the Saturday that the priesi; was killed.\u00a0\u00a0 This witness admitted\u00a0 having\u00a0 testified at\u00a0 Escalante\u00a0 before the justice of the peace, but denied having there declared that she had spent the day in question away from home. The justice of the peace testified that this witness did swear before him\u00a0 that she had spent that\u00a0 Saturday\u00a0 away from Gil's house.<\/p><p>Francisco Flores,\u00a0 a tailor,\u00a0 whose shop was in the lower part of Gil's house, testified\u00a0 that\u00a0 he had spent the entire day in question\u00a0 cutting cloth for garments for a boy, and thus came to know that Gil was sick in his room all day. He claimed\u00a0 that he did\u00a0 this work upstairs because he had no table in\u00a0 his\u00a0 shop, but it\u00a0 was shown that there\u00a0 was a table downstairs in the shop of this\u00a0 witness at that time.<\/p><p>Pelagia Majinay testified that on the day of the murder Gil was so ill that he\u00a0 did not go out of his room all day, and that a few days after the arrest of Gil she met Ferrer at the house\u00a0 of\u00a0 Asuncion Alfan, where Ferrer tried to induce her by bribery and threats to testify that there had been a meeting in Gil's house; but Alfan stated that it was she\u00a0 who\u00a0 had\u00a0 the\u00a0 conversation\u00a0 with Majinay\u00a0 and\u00a0 that although Ferrer\u00a0 was\u00a0 present,\u00a0 he said nothing whatever to Majinay.<\/p><p>If the testimony for the witnesses for the prosecution is to be believed, Mauricio Gamao admitted his guilt to Dolores Labida\u00a0 [Labadia]\u00a0 on the morning after the murder occurred.\u00a0\u00a0 He likewise admitted his guilt in the confessions made before the\u00a0 justice of the peace and other\u00a0 witnesses. If Mauricio were innocent, it is almost inconceivable that he should have involved himself and his uncle, upon whom he was dependent for maintenance, in a crime which, prior to his confessions, remained a mystery.\u00a0 If, on the other hand, Mauricio is guilty, the circumstances under which he was about to be removed from his home to Bacolod\u00a0 were such as would induce him to\u00a0 seek to free himself from the impending danger by implicating those who had involved him in this crime.\u00a0 He must\u00a0 have known that the real cause of his arrest and transfer to Bacolod was to procure his detention until evidence could be obtained against him for the murder of the priest.\u00a0 The fact that those against whom he made complaint refrained from furnishing the bond of one hundred pesos (the amount fixed by the justice of the peace for Mauricio's provisional liberty on the charge of carrying concealed\u00a0 weapons) that would have secured him his liberty, must have indicated to him that they intended to leave him to suffer the\u00a0 fate of Pedro Git, themselves seeking to\u00a0 avoid all suspicion by not interfering in his behalf.\u00a0\u00a0 Mauricio went to the house of Gil and reported to the latter that: \"The thing is done.\u00a0\u00a0 The <em>padre<\/em> is dead.\" <\/p><p>The defense of Gil Gamao\u00a0 was\u00a0 directed almost solely to the proposition that his codefendants were not at his house on the day of the murder, and that on that day he himself was so ill that he did not leave his bed; consequently, that he did not conspire with his codef endants to induce Mauricio to kill the priest.<\/p><p>In summing up the case, the trial court, in determining the weight to be given to the testimony presented, after a very careful study and analysis of all the evidence, said:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"In weighing this\u00a0 testimony in the endeavor to sift the false from the true and to ascertain what is the fact, the court has sought to be careful\u00a0 in considering the surrounding circumstances, the probabilities and improbabilities, the intelligence or lack\u00a0 of intelligence and\u00a0 personal\u00a0 status of each witness,\u00a0 whether\u00a0 through enmity or for\u00a0 any other reason a witness might have a motive for giving false testimony against any of the accused\u00a0 or whether through a personal obligation,\u00a0 friendship, relationship, menial condition or dependency a witness should have a motive or might be induced to\u00a0 give false testimony in favor of any of them. And in trying to ascertain further, the credibility that should be given each\u00a0 witness, the court has endeavored to consider carefully prior statements made, and former testimony given by these witnesses upon this\u00a0 same matter\u00a0 and when the former statements and testimony given differs from\u00a0 that made\u00a0 by the\u00a0 same\u00a0 witness here,\u00a0 all of the\u00a0 surrounding circumstances of this case and preliminary to its commencement have been considered in the effort to ascertain whether the\u00a0 first was forced and\u00a0 false,\u00a0 and\u00a0 the\u00a0 last is true,\u00a0 or whether the last is false and the first was voluntary and true.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The record in this case, which is voluminous, shows\u00a0 that the trial judge\u00a0 gave the appellants every opportunity\u00a0 to present their defense.\u00a0 He allowed the defense great latitude in the cross-examination of witnesses.\u00a0 He had an\u00a0 opportunity to see the witnesses, hear them testify, and note their demeanor on the stand.\u00a0 He finally reached the conclusion, after a thorough study of the whole case, that the testimony of record established beyond a reasonable doubt that it was the appellant Mauricio Gamao who murdered Father Victor Baltanas on the night of May 15, and that the said Mauricio was directly induced to commit this crime by the other appellant, Gil Gamao.\u00a0 We think these conclusions or findings of fact are fully sustained by the record.<\/p><p>The trial court classified the crime as that of assassination, there being present as to Mauricio Gamao the qualifying circumstance of alevosia,\u00a0 and as to Gil\u00a0 Gamao that of known\u00a0 premeditation.\u00a0 The court also found\u00a0 that there were not\u00a0 present\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 commission\u00a0 of this\u00a0 crime\u00a0 any aggravating or extenuating circumstances,\u00a0 except the\u00a0 aggravating circumstance of known premeditation on the part of Mauricio Gamao.<\/p><p>Counsel\u00a0 for the appellants\u00a0 insists, among other things, that the court erred in finding that Gil Gamao\u00a0 was guilty as a principal by induction.\u00a0 Article 13 of the Penal Code provides:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"ART.\u00a0 13.\u00a0 The following are considered as principals:\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"1. Those who take a direct part in the\u00a0 commission of the act.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"2. Those who\u00a0 directly\u00a0 force or\u00a0 induce others\u00a0 to commit it.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Viada, in his Commentaries, in discussing this No. 2, says:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"But it must be borne in mind that these\u00a0 acts of inducement must not consist of simple counsel before\u00a0 the perpetration of the crime, nor of simple words at\u00a0 the moment of its execution.\u00a0\u00a0 Such counsel or such\u00a0 words constitute without doubt wrongful acts and a reprehensible incentive before the moral law.\u00a0 But in order\u00a0 that they may be\u00a0 considered as a direct inducement according to the code it is necessary that he who gives such counsel or says such words must have a great control and a\u00a0 great influence upon the person who is to act and is necessary\u00a0 that this should be so direct, so efficacious, so powerful,\" as to make it\u00a0 a physical\u00a0 or moral coercion as powerful\u00a0 as the violence itself.\"\u00a0 (Vol. 1, p. 354.)<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Mauricio\u00a0 Gamao,\u00a0 nephew of Gil\u00a0 Gamao, was\u00a0 a poor, ignorant\u00a0 fisherman, and\u00a0 more or less dependent upon\u00a0 his uncle\u00a0 for subsistence.\u00a0 On\u00a0 the other\u00a0 hand, Captain\u00a0 Gil Gamao was when this crime was committed, a man of great influence in Escalante.\u00a0 He had a great number of people working for him, one of whom was his nephew Mauricio. He was the local political leader of his party.\u00a0 One of his nephews was president of the town.\u00a0 He had two brothers-in-law in the municipal council. of his nephews, one was chief of police and two others were members of the police force.\u00a0 He had acquired,\u00a0 as we\u00a0 have said, a bitter hatred toward the Roman Catholic Church and the Spanish friars and priests.\u00a0 He called a\u00a0 meeting in his own house on the afternoon of May 15th, where the question of murdering the priest was\u00a0 discussed.\u00a0\u00a0 He was\u00a0 the prime mover in this meeting.\u00a0 He dominated all who were present.\u00a0 He selected his nephew\u00a0 Maurjcio to commit the\u00a0 crime and directed him to do it.\u00a0 Mauricio, immediately after murdering the priest, returned to\u00a0 the house of his uncle Gil and reported the fact. The influence exercised by Gil Gamao over his nephew was so great\u00a0 and powerful that the latter, through\u00a0 fear,\u00a0 could not resist it.\u00a0 That Mauricio was directly induced to murder the priest by his uncle Gil we think there can be no\u00a0 question.<\/p><p>Counsel also insist that\u00a0 the court erred in classifying the crime as assassination,\u00a0 On the\u00a0 other hand,\u00a0 the Attorney-General insists that\u00a0 as to Mauricio Gamao,\u00a0 there\u00a0 were present, not only the\u00a0 qualifying circumstance\u00a0 of\u00a0 alevosia, but also the aggravating circumstances of known\u00a0 premeditation and hire or reward, and that as to Gil Gamao,\u00a0 there was present, aside from the qualifying\u00a0 circumstance of known premeditation,\u00a0 the aggravating circumstance of having induced\u00a0 the commission of this crime by hire or reward.<\/p><p>The deceased received the fatal blow while he was in the dark space between the door and the stairs leading to\u00a0 the upper portion of the\u00a0 convent.\u00a0\u00a0 He was\u00a0 unable to see by whom the blow was struck.\u00a0 He had no opportunity to offer any resistance whatever.\u00a0 The murderer\u00a0 taking advantage of the darkness was lying in wait for\u00a0 his victim, thereby employing means or methods in the\u00a0 execution of this crime which tended directly and specially to insure its execution without risk to himself, arising from the defense which the priest might make.\u00a0 These facts clearly establish the qualifying circumstance of alevosia in so far as Mauricio Gamao is concerned.<\/p><p>It is true that the circumstance of alevosia cannot be used either as a qualifying or modifying circumstance, as to Gil Gamao, for the reason that there\u00a0 is nothing in the record to show that Gil\u00a0 Gamao directed or induced Mauricio to adopt the means or methods actually used by the latter in accomplishing the murder.\u00a0 He only directed and induced Mauricio to\u00a0 commit the murder, leaving the\u00a0 details\u00a0 as to how it was to be accomplished to Mauricio.\u00a0 But as to\u00a0 Gil Gamao\u00a0 there was present the\u00a0 qualifying circumstance of known\u00a0 premeditation, which raises\u00a0 his\u00a0 offense to that of assassination, inasmuch as it has\u00a0 been shown that as far back\u00a0 as March,\u00a0 1907, he attempted to induce Batolinao to kill the\u00a0 priest who was then at Escalante.\u00a0 In\u00a0 March,\u00a0 1909, two months\u00a0 prior to\u00a0 the murder,\u00a0 Gil offered Jose Patpat fifty\u00a0 pesos to kill the deceased.\u00a0 Some\u00a0 days\u00a0 prior to,\u00a0 the murder, Miguel Gamao\u00a0 heard\u00a0 his uncle Gil\u00a0 say\u00a0 that\u00a0 an anarchistic society had been formed with the object of killing the\u00a0 friars.\u00a0\u00a0 Again, Gil, on\u00a0 the afternoon\u00a0 of May 15th presided at the meeting held in his own house,\u00a0 where it was agreed that the priest should be killed, and he there deliberately\u00a0 selected his nephew to commit this crime, and directly induced him to do\u00a0 it.\u00a0 The determination\u00a0 to\u00a0 have the deceased murdered originated\u00a0 in\u00a0 his mind long before the crime was\u00a0 actually committed.\u00a0 This determination was constantly persisted in until he was successful.\u00a0\u00a0 He had full opportunity for\u00a0 meditation and\u00a0 reflection, and ample time to allow his conscience to overcome the determination of his will had he so desired.\u00a0\u00a0 All of these facts were certainly sufficient to justify the trial court\u00a0 in holding that the crime, in so\u00a0 far as Gil Gamao was concerned, was\u00a0 committed with known premeditation.\u00a0\u00a0 (U. S. <em>vs<\/em>. Ricafor, 1 Phil. Rep., 173; U. S.\u00a0 <em>vs<\/em>. Gil, 13 Phil. Rep., 530.)<\/p><p>If there were present, as to Mauricio Gamao, one, two, or more aggravating\u00a0 circumstances,\u00a0 the penalty would be the same in this case, as, owing to his extreme ignorance, this court would be compelled to give\u00a0 him the benefits\u00a0 of article 11.<\/p><p>We are unable to agree with the Attorney-General in his contention\u00a0 that the aggravating circumstance that Gil Gamao forced or induced his nephew to murder the priest by hire or reward should be applied, for the reason that the record does not show beyond a reasonable doubt that Mauricio Gamao was forced or induced to commit this crime in this manner.\u00a0 The only testimony upon this point is: (1)\u00a0 That of the\u00a0 witness Ferrer, who stated that Mauricio told him that he had been offered money to kill the priest but that he had refused to accept it.\u00a0\u00a0 (2) That of Carlos Cabus, wherein he stated that Rufino Pineda\u00a0 approached him on behalf\u00a0 of Gil Gamao and asked for a contribution of one hundred pesos to be used in hiring Mauricio to kill the deceased.\u00a0\u00a0 (3) That of Jose Patpat who testified that Gil Gamao offered him fifty pesos to kill Baltanas.\u00a0\u00a0 (4)\u00a0 That of Dolores\u00a0 Labida\u00a0 [Labadia],\u00a0 who testified that\u00a0 during the meeting held at Gil's house on May 15th she overheard Gil propose that Mauricio murder the priest, which is the only direct testimony upon this\u00a0 point.\u00a0\u00a0 Labida here states ,that Gil Gamao offered\u00a0 to release Mauricio of\u00a0 all\u00a0 his indebtedness and give him \"fifty more\" if he would kill the priest.\u00a0 Mauricio\u00a0 stated, according to the testimony of Ferrer, that it was true that he had been offered money to kill the padre but that he would not accept it.\u00a0\u00a0 Accepting as true the\u00a0 testimony of Labida [Labadia] and the statement of Mauricio\u00a0 upon this point, it has been shown that Gil <em>offered<\/em> Mauricio a reward if he would dispose of the priest, but that Mauricio refused\u00a0 to accept it.\u00a0\u00a0 The testimony of Cabus and Patpat shows that Gil had been attempting for a long time to\u00a0 hire someone\u00a0 to\u00a0 kill\u00a0 the\u00a0 priest. This strongly tends to establish the fact that Mauricio was actually offered a reward to commit this crime by his uncle, but Mauricio flatly denies that he received any money or other reward for committing the murder.\u00a0 This statement of Mauricio\u00a0 was made at the time he made\u00a0 his confessions, which were accepted by the court as true.\u00a0 If it was a fact that Mauricio Gamao owed his uncle a sum of money, the latter could have used these obligations as a club in forcing his nephew to commit the crime.\u00a0\u00a0 For Mauricio, knowing his uncle's power and influence in the community, and his own insignificance, could well anticipate what would happen to one who incurred his displeasure, and having\u00a0 received pecuniary assistance from his uncle, he could well expect a visitation of his displeasure in a more serious form than if he had never received such favors from his uncle.\u00a0 It would also appear that if he had received a reward to commit the crime, he would have admitted it, as such\u00a0 an admission would no doubt, in his opinion, have had great weight with the authorities in securing his release.\u00a0\u00a0 After an examination of the whole record upon this point, we agree with the trial court that it has not been shown beyond a reasonable doubt that Gil Gamao actually hired Mauricio to kill the deceased by giving him money or promising to release him from all his indebtedness.<\/p><p>While this case was pending\u00a0 on appeal,\u00a0 a motion was made on the 18th of December, 1909, for a new trial.\u00a0\u00a0 This motion complied\u00a0 with the provisions of the statute on the subject and was accompanied by various affidavits.\u00a0 Before the question of a new trial was passed upon by this\u00a0 court, counsel presented another motion on October 9, 1910,\u00a0 in which\u00a0 it was alleged that one Crispulo Pavilona had been sentenced to life\u00a0 imprisonment subsequent to the sentence which was rendered against the appellants in this case, for the same crime\u2014that of killing Father Baltanas\u2014and that the said Pavilona is now serving the sentence imposed upon him.\u00a0 In view of the allegations made in these two motions and\u00a0 the\u00a0 affidavits accompanying\u00a0 the\u00a0 first, this court, on December 17, 1910,\u00a0 granted a new trial as\u00a0 prayed for, and the record was returned to the court from whence it came for this purpose.\u00a0\u00a0 Upon\u00a0 the second trial, which took place in Bacolod about the first of April, 1911, in the presence of the appellants and their counsel, the entire record\u00a0 in the former trial was introduced in due form, and the only further testimony presented was by the defense, who placed Miguel Gamao, the nephew of Gil Gamao, upon the stand, a witness for the prosecution in the former trial.\u00a0\u00a0 In this last trial this witness testified that the testimony given by him on the first trial was under compulsion.\u00a0 The trial court again sentenced these two appellants to the same penalty, holding that the new testimony was not sufficient to cause a reasonable doubt in his mind as to the guilt of either\u00a0 Mauricio or\u00a0 Gil\u00a0 Gamao.\u00a0 The\u00a0 two\u00a0 condemned men again appealed,\u00a0 and it is now insisted that the guilt of both Crispulo\u00a0 Pavilona\u00a0 and the appellants in the case at bar is incompatible,\u00a0 for the reason\u00a0 that if Pavilona murdered the priest, Mauricio Gamao did not. While it has been\u00a0 suggested that the said Crispulo Pavilona was arrested, arraigned, pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of Father Baltanas, yet, notwithstanding the fact that this court granted the appellants a new trial,\u00a0 they never introduced nor attempted to introduce the decision of the court\u00a0 in the case against Pavilona, nor did they attempt to make any showing upon this question whatsoever.\u00a0 On the other hand, it was suggested by means\u00a0 of\u00a0 an affidavit that Crispulo Pavilona stated that in killing the priest he operated with both these appellants and received\u00a0 from Gil Gamao money for committing this crime.\u00a0 These suggestions, however, not having been\u00a0 established\u00a0 nor even\u00a0 an attempt made to establish them\u00a0 on\u00a0 the second trial,\u00a0 we\u00a0 cannot\u00a0 take\u00a0 them\u00a0 into consideration.<\/p><p>For all of the foregoing reasons, the judgment condemning these appellants\u00a0 to\u00a0 life imprisonment, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of one thousand pesos, and to the payment of the costs of the cause, is hereby affirmed, with costs of this\u00a0 instance against the appellants.<\/p><p><em>Arellano, C.

Phipps, as auditor, refused to issue said clearance for the above noted period because of the danger of a probable suit, application to bring which has not even been made,\u00a0 and never will be granted, as the last allegation in Paragraph\u00a0 VI of this petition demonstrates that this auditorial Fernandez claim has not the shadow of a shade of legal ground.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 \"IX.\u00a0 Respondent's action in the investigation of this whole affair has been illegal and improper.\u00a0\u00a0 He has not only failed specifically to inform relator of the facts upon which this complaint was\u00a0 based, but actually\u00a0 refused to permit an attorney from his Office to\u00a0 sit with\u00a0 the\u00a0 Attorney-General in order that relator might be\u00a0 confronted with the\u00a0 facts alleged\u00a0 against him and\u00a0 given an opportunity to explain same.<\/p><p> \"During relator's\u00a0 absence\u00a0 from the colony, respondent's deputies or agents, without warrant of\u00a0 law or without even asking permission of reiator, seized a locked and sealed box, the property of relator,\u00a0 and\u00a0 without his permission or warrant of law forcibly broke\u00a0 open same\u00a0 and extracted therefrom documents and papers,the personal property of relator\u00a0 and property for which relator,\u00a0 as superintendent of Iwahig Penal Colony, was responsible, and\u00a0 respondent has not returned same though requested to do so.\u00a0 This act of robbery\u00a0 respondent attempts\u00a0 to justify\u00a0 on the ground that it was 'done in the presence of witnesses.'<\/p><p> \"X. Relator's attorney has been in Manila more than a month engaged in this case, trying to obtain from respondent a legal hearing;\u00a0 and relator himself, at great financial loss and mental worry, has remained ready\u00a0 to comply with any\u00a0 legal requirements\u00a0 of\u00a0 respondent\u00a0 for nearly three months.\u00a0\u00a0 Both relator and his attorney have exhausted all ordinary means within human power to obtain from\u00a0 respondent this clearance or a\u00a0 legal reason for its withholding;\u00a0 but all efforts so to do have been in vain, and there is no other plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the ordinary courts\u00a0 of\u00a0 law by which\u00a0 relator can obtain relief, except through these proceedings.<\/p><p> \"XI. Therefore, relator, in utter despair, appears before this court and begs it to hear his petition and to issue\u00a0 a peremptory mandate commanding W. H. Phipps, as Auditor for the Philippine Islands, to issue at once\u00a0 to C. H. Lamb a perfect clearance and one\u00a0 fully effective, so relator can enjoy his constitutional rights\u00a0 to liberty and property and upon which\u00a0 the\u00a0 said C.\u00a0 H. Lamb may obtain\u00a0 from the Government of the Philippine Islands all amounts due him for salary, accrued leave\u00a0 and transportation, by virtue of his employment\u00a0 as superintendent of\u00a0 the Iwahig Penal Colony.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>\"Relator further asks damages against respondent in the amount of one thousand pesos (P1,000) Philippine currency, the expenditure of which\u00a0 amount relator has\u00a0 had to make by virtue of respondent's illegal acts and\u00a0 neglect of duty, and that\u00a0 respondent pay the\u00a0 costs of these\u00a0 proceedings.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0\"XII. In view of the fact that practically all the evidence upon\u00a0 which this petition is based is documentary and government reports,\u00a0 easily obtainable, and in view of\u00a0 the great unnecessary\u00a0 delay, expense\u00a0 and\u00a0 hardship already suffered by relator, and in view of\u00a0 the fact that relator is the general manager of a large business, just inaugurated by Amzi B.

In view of the importance of the question presented,\u00a0 it is deemed\u00a0 advisable to more fully discuss\u00a0 the law relating thereto.\u00a0 It may be noted that the petitioner did not file an amended petition within the time mentioned in the above order.\u00a0 The facts involved in the present case are stated in the petition.\u00a0 The\u00a0 materiality of the exhibits is not\u00a0 quite clear.\u00a0 It is believed that all of the material allegations of the petition which the <em>relator intended to make, <\/em>eliminating all purely\u00a0 evidential and immaterial allegations, may be fairly stated as follows, to wit:<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/><em>First,<\/em> that the\u00a0 relator had\u00a0 been for\u00a0 a period of four years the superintendent of the Iwahig Penal Colony.\u00a0\u00a0 (See paragraphs 1, 4 and 9 of the petition.)<p><\/p><p><em> Second<\/em>, that the\u00a0 relator<em> has rendered an account<\/em> for all property and funds of the Government which have come into his possession.\u00a0\u00a0 (See\u00a0 paragraphs\u00a0 3\u00a0 and 8 of the petition.) <br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <em>Third ,<\/em>that it\u00a0 is the\u00a0 legal duty of the\u00a0 respondent as Auditor for the Philippine Islands to issue an Auditor's certificate (clearance)\u00a0 to any employee or agent of the Government\u00a0 who\u00a0 has\u00a0 left the service, when the <em>records <\/em>of the office of the Auditor show that the accounts of said employee or agent are balanced and that said employee or agent has properly rendered an account for all Government property and funds which have come into his possession during the time\u00a0 of said\u00a0 employment.\u00a0\u00a0 (See\u00a0 paragraph\u00a0 3\u00a0 of the petition.)<\/p><p align=\"center\">\u00a0 MEANING OF AUDITOR'S CERTIFICATE OR CLEARANCE.<\/p><p>\u00a0 Before discussing the rules of\u00a0 law controlling in the present case, a word of explanation of what is meant by the Auditor's certificate (clearance) may be of assistance to a better understanding of the purpose of the present petition. Act No. 1605 of the Philippine Commission provides that no bonded officer or bonded employee of the Insular Government, or of any provincial or municipal government in the Philippine Islands, or of the city of Manila, whether in the actual service of such Government or separated therefrom, shall leave or attempt to leave the Philippine Islands\u00a0 without first securing a <em>certificate <\/em>(clearance) from the Auditor showing that his accounts with the Government of which he is or was such bonded officer or bonded employee\u00a0 have been <em>finally settled <\/em>by said Auditor.\u00a0 Said Act further provides that any such officer or employee violating any of the provisions of\u00a0 this\u00a0 Act\u00a0 shall, on\u00a0 conviction thereof, be punished by imprisonment for not exceeding six months or by a fine of not more than P1,000 or both, in the discretion of the court.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 During the argument of the present cause, the attorney for the relator stated that he could not leave or attempt to leave the Philippine Islands, without rendering himself liable to a\u00a0 criminal prosecution under and by virtue of said Act (No. 1605), without\u00a0 having the Auditor's certificate or clearance.\u00a0 It will be noted upon reading the petition that there is no word or intimation therein indicating in any way (except the allegation that the relator\u00a0 had been the custodian of Government property and\u00a0 funds) that he was a bonded officer.\u00a0 Unless he was a bonded officer or employee of the Government, said Act does not apply to him and there is no necessity for a\u00a0 clearance.\u00a0 Said Act (No. 1605)\u00a0 only applies to<em>bonded officers or employees.<\/em>\u00a0 It may be assumed, however, for the purposes of the present case, that the relator was a bonded officer or employee of the Philippine \u00a0 Government and that in the absence of the Auditor's certificate or clearance he might be subjected to a criminal action under said Act (No.\u00a0 1605) if\u00a0 he attempted to leave the Philippine Islands without said\u00a0 certificate.<\/p><p align=\"center\"> DUTY OP THE AUDITOR IN APPROVING ACCOUNTS.<\/p><p> The relator alleges that he has rendered an account for all property and funds of the Government which came into his possession, and\u00a0 concludes that he is therefore entitled to an Auditor's, certificate or\u00a0 clearance.\u00a0\u00a0 Is the mere rendition of accounts\u00a0 of\u00a0 Government property and funds by an employee all that is\u00a0 necessary to entitle such employee to his clearance?\u00a0\u00a0 Is the Auditor, who is responsible for the proper\u00a0 disposition\u00a0\u00a0 of Government property\u00a0 and funds, obliged to accept a mere paper balance?\u00a0 Is the Auditor not to be given an\u00a0 opportunity to count the cash (funds)\u00a0 as well as to see that the property of the Government actually exists which had been in the possession or under the control of such employee?\u00a0\u00a0 Is the Auditor not to be given an opportunity to make an\u00a0 actual inspection\u00a0 for\u00a0 the purpose\u00a0 of satisfying his own\u00a0 mind that the paper balance conforms with the actual\u00a0 facts?\u00a0\u00a0 Experience has taught auditors as well\u00a0 as business men generally\u00a0 that <em>mere paper balances are not always reliable. <\/em> The actual funds and property are not always visible, in such balances.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 It is confidently contended that the Auditor is not obliged under the law to accept a mere paper accounting as final and conclusive as to the real responsibility of Government employees and to issue a clearance upon that alone.\u00a0 He may, it is true, if he is satisfied; but certainly, he may, if he so desires and if he has any doubt about the correctness\u00a0 of such accounts, make an actual examination of the funds and property represented by such\u00a0 paper accounts or balances. If, then, the Auditor\u00a0 is\u00a0 not\u00a0 obliged to accept the\u00a0 mere paper accounts or balances, when or within what time must he make his investigations and pass upon the accounts rendered?\u00a0 Must he do so immediately?\u00a0 The law does not so require.\u00a0 In justice to all parties and especially for the best interests of the Government, he should verify the accounts rendered as soon as practicable.\u00a0 In any event, the accounts must be verified and accepted or rejected before the lapse of three years.\u00a0\u00a0 (Sec.\u00a0 29,\u00a0 Act No.\u00a0 1792.)\u00a0\u00a0 At least,\u00a0 it would seem under said\u00a0 Act\u00a0 (Sec. 29, Act No. 1792) that after the lapse of three years the\u00a0 accounts cannot\u00a0 be reopened against an employee\u00a0 or agent.\u00a0 In the present case there is no allegation showing when the accounts were rendered.\u00a0 The relator resigned from his position on the 31st day of December, 1911.\u00a0\u00a0 His resignation was accepted January 2, 1912.\u00a0 Certainly, his final accounts were not rendered before that date.\u00a0\u00a0 In the present case, at least,\u00a0 there seems to\u00a0 have been no unreasonable or unnecessary\u00a0 delay, and there is no allegation in\u00a0 the petition to that effect. In fact the relator\u00a0 alleged\u00a0 that the respondent\u00a0 had\u00a0 already acted and had denied his claim (see paragraph\u00a0 8 of petition) and gave what seems to be a good reason therefor.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 Whenever a duty is imposed upon a public official and an unnecessary and\u00a0 unreasonable delay in the exercise of such duty occurs, if it is a clear duty imposed by law, the courts will intervene by the extraordinary legal remedy of mandamus to <em>compel action.<\/em>\u00a0 If the duty is purely ministerial, the courts will\u00a0 require <em>specific action.<\/em>\u00a0 If the duty is purely discretionary, the courts\u00a0 by\u00a0 mandamus will require <em>action only.<\/em>\u00a0 For example, if an inferior court, public official, or board should, for an unreasonable length of time, fail to decide a particular question to the great detriment of all the parties concerned, or a court should refuse to take\u00a0 jurisdiction of a\u00a0 cause when the law clearly gave it jurisdiction, mandamus will issue, in the first case to require a decision, and\u00a0 in the second to\u00a0 require that jurisdiction\u00a0 be taken of the cause.\u00a0\u00a0 (De la Beckwith <em>vs<\/em>.

In 1835 Mr. Jackson, then President of the United States, was asked to overrule a decision of the Comptroller of the United States.\u00a0 He declined so to do and made the following brief\u00a0 reply to said request:<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 \"The decision of the second Comptroller\u00a0 is final, over whose decisions the President has no power except by removal.\"<\/p><p> During the\u00a0 administration of Mr.\u00a0 Polk, a\u00a0 request was made of him to interfere with the adjustment of a claim which had been presented to and passed upon\u00a0 by the Comptroller of the United States,\u00a0 He declined to\u00a0 interfere and in so doing made the following observation:<\/p><p> \"I decline to interfere on the ground that\u00a0 Congress\u00a0 has expressly given the\u00a0 authority to settle claims to the\u00a0 accounting\u00a0 officers *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 and that I have no right to control these officers in the performance of their duties.\" (Aug. 9, 1845.)<\/p><p> As\u00a0 early as\u00a0 1789 an Act was passed by the Congress of the United States providing that the auditing and revision of accounts should be made by officers <em>holding their, appointments independent of heads of the\u00a0 departments and wholly unconnected with the\u00a0 disbursement of\u00a0 the public money.<\/em> The Congress of the United States, in said Act, deemed it essential to the judicious and economical administration of the\u00a0 financial affairs of the government, that the officers who directed\u00a0 the expenditures should\u00a0 not also\u00a0 judge of their legality.\u00a0\u00a0 Hence, we have, from the very beginning of\u00a0 the Government of the United States, laws which provided\u00a0 for the\u00a0 adjustment of accounts, by accounting officers, whose <em>decisions were final <\/em>and who held their appointment independent of the heads of the departments and wholly unconnected with the disbursements of the public funds.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 We find in Senate Document No. 6, at page 5 of the second session of the Twenty-third Congress of the United States, the following statement, which indicates the view of the Senate of the United States tipon the question which we are discussing;<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 \"No effectual check can ever exist in any case where the <em>same officer<\/em> authorizes the expenditure and then audits, or controls the audit of the accounts.\"<\/p><p> Auditors and comptrollers,\u00a0 as\u00a0 accounting officers, are generally regarded as quasi-official officers.\u00a0 They perform mere <em>ministerial duties only in cases where the\u00a0 sum due is conclusively fixed by law or pursuant to law.\u00a0 Except in such cases, the action of the accounting officers <\/em>upon claims coming before them for\u00a0 settlement and certification of balances found by them\u00a0 to be due, is not ministerial merely but judicial and discretionary.\u00a0\u00a0 This is shown not only by the express language of the statutes generally,\u00a0 but by the rulings of the Supreme Court of the United States. In the case of Watkins vs. United States (9 Wall., 759, 764) Mr. Justice Clifford, delivering the opinion of the court, said:<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 \"Vouchers are required by the very words of\u00a0 the Act of Congress\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.\u00a0 Without\u00a0 such\u00a0 evidences before the accounting officers there could\u00a0 not be any intelligent\u00a0 scrutiny of the claim nor any decision which would be\u00a0 satisfactory to the claimant or to the public.\"<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 See also the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in\u00a0 the case of Decatur <em>vs.<\/em> Paulding (14\u00a0 Pet.,\u00a0 497) (1840), where Mr. Chief Justice Taney, in delivering the opinion of the court upon the question of the right of the courts to issue mandamus to control the action of an executive officer said:<\/p><p> \"In general, the official duties of the head of\u00a0 one of the executive departments, whether imposed by Act of Congress or by resolution, <em>are not mere ministerial duties<\/em>.\u00a0 The\u00a0 head of an executive department of the government, in the administration of the various and important concerns of his office, is\u00a0 continually required to exercise judgment and discretion. He must exercise his judgment in expounding the laws and resolutions of Congress,\u00a0 under which he is from time to time required to act.\u00a0 If he doubts, he has a right to call on the attorney-general to assist him with his counsel; and it would be difficult to imagine why a legal adviser was provided by law for the\u00a0 heads of departments, as well as for\u00a0 the\u00a0 President,\u00a0 unless their duties were regarded\u00a0 as executive\u00a0 in\u00a0 which judgment and discretion\u00a0 were to\u00a0 be exercised.\"\u00a0 (Kendall <em>vs<\/em>. U.

In general, such duties, whether imposed by Act of Congress or\u00a0 by resolution,\u00a0 are not mere ministerial duties.\u00a0 The head of an executive department of the\u00a0 government, in the administration of the various and important concerns of his office, is continually\u00a0 required to exercise judgment and\u00a0 discretion.\u00a0 He must exercise his judgment in\u00a0 expounding the laws\u00a0 and resolutions of\u00a0 Congress, under which he is from time to time required to act. *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 If a suit should\u00a0 come before this\u00a0 court which involved the construction of any\u00a0 of these laws, the court certainly would\u00a0 not be bound to adopt the construction given by the\u00a0 head\u00a0 of a department.\u00a0 And if they supposed his construction to be wrong, they\u00a0 would,\u00a0 of\u00a0 course,\u00a0 so\u00a0 pronounce their judgment.\u00a0 But their judgment upon the construction of a law must be given in a case in\u00a0 which\u00a0 they have jurisdiction, and in which it is their duty to interpret the Act of Congress in\u00a0 order to ascertain the rights of the parties in the cause before them.\u00a0\u00a0 The court could not entertain an appeal from the decision of one of the Secretaries, nor revise his judgment in any case where the law authorized him to\u00a0 exercise discretion or judgment.\u00a0 Nor can it by mandamus act directly upon the officer, and guide and control his judgment or discretion in the matters committed to his care,\u00a0 in the ordinary discharge of his\u00a0 official duties.\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 The\u00a0 interference of the courts\u00a0 with the performance of the ordinary duties of the executive departments of the government would\u00a0 be productive of nothing but mischief, and we are quite satisfied that such a power was never intended to be given to them.'\u00a0 And in the Riverside Oil Co. case (U. S. ex rel\u00a0 Riverside Oil Co. 190 U.

The\u00a0 duties of public\u00a0 officers are of two kinds: (1) those of a political or legislative character, in the discharge of which their discretion is uncontrollable by mandamus; (2) those administrative,\u00a0 judicial,\u00a0 and\u00a0 quasi-judicial\u00a0 duties imposed by law.\u00a0 No one will claim that the duties, of the respondent belong to the first class.\u00a0 His duties, under the statutes,\u00a0 are\u00a0 administrative, and, to some extent,\u00a0 quasi-judicial,\u00a0 only.\u00a0 I am not\u00a0 unaware of the fact that the Government of the Philippine Islands is divided into three separate\u00a0 and coordinate departments: the legislative, the executive, and the judicial; that each\u00a0 department operates as independently of the other as the same departments do in the United States, and that the respondent is an executive officer.\u00a0\u00a0 This being true, it is said that inasmuch as each department has\u00a0 the right to judge of the laws for itself and as each\u00a0 officer is only responsible for\u00a0 an abuse\u00a0 or usurpation in the mode pointed out\u00a0 in the law, it necessarily follows that the respondent must be supreme within the scope of his powers and not subject to control by the courts for the manner in which he\u00a0 performs\u00a0 or\u00a0 fails\u00a0 to perform his legal duties.\u00a0\u00a0 This argument is\u00a0 founded on theory, rather than on reality.\u00a0\u00a0 There is no express provision in the Organic Act, nor in any other statute, exempting the respondent, as chief of the Bureau of Audits, from being sued in any of the courts of the Philippine Islands, or in any action coming within the\u00a0 jurisdiction\u00a0 of any particular court; upon contract or upon tort, <em>quo warranto, habeas\u00a0 corpus, <\/em>mandamus,\u00a0 or injunction;\u00a0 or from being liable to any process or writ, properly issued, by any court, such as subpoenas, summons, and other writs of process. If he is exempt from\u00a0 all kinds\u00a0 of suits in\u00a0 the courts and from\u00a0 all kinds of process issued by the courts,\u00a0 it must be because of some hidden or occult implications of the laws or statutes or from some inherent and\u00a0 insuperable barriers found in the structure of the government\u00a0 itself, and riot from the express provisions of the statutes.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 As I have said, the question as to\u00a0 whether or not the courts of the Philippine\u00a0 Islands may control any of the acts of the Governor-General has been decided in the negative.\u00a0 The question, however, whether the courts of this country may control any of the acts of the Auditor should, in my opinion, upon well founded legal principles, be decided in the affirmative.\u00a0 If it be decided (and this court, for all practical purposes has so held this point to be examined later) that the Auditor, because he is chief of the Bureau of Audits, may, for that reason, be allowed to enjoy absolute immunity from all judicial process,\u00a0 even when, as in the given instance, the personal liberty of a\u00a0 citizen is at stake, then, why cannot the same exemption from judicial process be set up by any one of the officers of the executive department?\u00a0 Upon this theory there can&gt; be but one answer to this question.<\/p><blockquote><p> \"The duty of the Auditor (the respondent in this case) shall be to examine, audit, and settle all accounts pertaining to the revenues and receipts from whatever source of the Insular Government and\u00a0 of the city of Manila, including trust funds and funds derived from bond issues;\u00a0 and to audit,<em> in accordance with law\u00a0 and administrative regulations<\/em>, all expenditures of funds or\u00a0 property pertaining to or held in trust by the Insular Government and the city of Manila.\u00a0 (Act No. 1792, sec. 2.)<\/p><p> \"The jurisdiction of the Auditor over accounts, whether of funds or property, and\u00a0 all vouchers and records pertaining thereto, shall be exclusive.\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *<\/p><p> \"The decisions of the Auditor shall be final and conclusive upon the <em>executive branches<\/em> of the Government, except that appeal therefrom may be\u00a0 taken by the party aggrieved or the head of the Department concerned, within\u00a0 one year, in the manner hereinafter prescribed.\"\u00a0 (Id., sec. 6.)<\/p><\/blockquote><p> Section\u00a0 9 of Act\u00a0 No.\u00a0 1792\u00a0 authorizes\u00a0 the Auditor to summon witnesses, administer oaths, and\u00a0 to take evidence in certain cases,\u00a0 and by\u00a0 section 50 of the same Act the Auditor may, with the written consent of the\u00a0 Governor-General, mitigate, remit,\u00a0 remove, compromise, release, or discharge any liability, in whole or in part, to the Insular Government, a provincial or a municipal government, in any matter before him, when in his judgment the interests of the Government require it, provided, however, that no liability in excess\u00a0 of two thousand pesos shall be so mitigated, remitted, or compromised.\u00a0 By authority contained\u00a0 in section\u00a0 29 of said Act,\u00a0 the Auditor, on account\u00a0 of\u00a0 fraud, collusion, error in calculation, or newly discovered material evidence, or when, in his judgment, the interests\u00a0 of\u00a0 the Government may seem to\u00a0 require it, is authorized,\u00a0 within three years after original settlement, to reopen su'ch settlement, and after written notice to the person interested and after a reasonable time for the reply or appearance of such person, to\u00a0 certify thereon a new\u00a0 balance.\u00a0 The\u00a0 foregoing are all of the provisions\u00a0 of law\u00a0 touching the powers and duties of the\u00a0 respondent which are necessary to be considered in this case.<\/p><p> The conclusions of\u00a0 the\u00a0 court are stated in four paragraphs.\u00a0 In paragraph (<em>a<\/em>) it is stated that the courts will take\u00a0 jurisdiction against\u00a0 the Auditor for the\u00a0 Philippine Islands in a proper case to compel action on his part when by reason of unnecessary delays in taking any action at all persons have\u00a0 been deprived of a right and have no other adequate and speedy remedy in the ordinary course of law. It is here held that the court will compel the Auditor to\u00a0 act under certain circumstances when the injured\u00a0 party has no other adequate and speedy remedy.\u00a0 In paragraph (<em>c<\/em>) the court holds\u00a0 that the appeal provided for in Act No. 1792 is a speedy, adequate, and <em>exclusive, remedy<\/em>.\u00a0\u00a0 Under this holding, if the Auditor fails to act at all, the courts will compel him to go forward, but not to decide the question in any specific manner.\u00a0 If he denies\u00a0 the request\u00a0 for a clearance presented by any person, the only remedy that person has is by appeal tp the Secretary of War through the Governor-General.\u00a0 He cannot, under this holding, obtain any relief whatever in any of the courts of the Philippine Islands.\u00a0 If such a decision of the Auditor is sustained by the Secretary\u00a0 of War, this court intimates in paragraph (<em>d<\/em>) of its conclusions that it might\u00a0 review the actions\u00a0 of the Auditor and the\u00a0 Secretary.\u00a0 But in the body of the opinion it is stated that the decision of the Auditor upon air accounts pertaining to the revenues and receipts, from whatever source, of every governmental entity within the Philippine Islands\u00a0 is final and conclusive <em>upon all parties,<\/em> unless an appeal is taken within one\u00a0 year to the Secretary of War through the Governor-General.\u00a0 It is also held that the decision of the Secretary of War upon such appeal\u00a0 is final and conclusive.\u00a0 After having decided that the decision of the Auditor and the Secretary of War upon all questions touching the revenues of the country and the allowance\u00a0 or disallowance of claims against the Government, is final and conclusive against all parties, the court says:<\/p><blockquote>\"When the law\u00a0 confers exclusive and final jurisdiction upon the executive department of the Government to dispose of particular questions, their judgments or the judgment\u00a0 of that particular department are no more\u00a0 reviewable by the courts than the final judgment or decisions of the courts are subject to be reviewed and modified by them.\"<p><\/p><\/blockquote><p>No one\u00a0 at any time has ever intimated\u00a0 that the judgments or decisions\u00a0 of the courts are\u00a0 reviewable by any\u00a0 of the executive departments.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>The result is\u00a0 that this court has decided: (1)\u00a0 that\u00a0 in the case at bar, as well as in all other cases, the Auditor, before he is required to issue a certificate of clearance, must examine,\u00a0 audit,\u00a0 and settle the accounts\u00a0 of the interested person; (2) that in reaching a decision upon these matters the Auditor must necessarily and does\u00a0 use judgment and discretion;\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 that such decisions\u00a0 by the\u00a0 Auditor are final and\u00a0 conclusive <em>upon all parties,<\/em> unless an appeal be taken as provided in Act No. 1792; and\u00a0 (4)\u00a0 that\u00a0 the decision of the Secretary of War\u00a0 upon\u00a0 such appeals is final and conclusive upon all parties.\u00a0\u00a0 Or, in other words, mandamus will never lie to compel the Auditor\u00a0 to issue a certificate of clearance to any one.\u00a0 The court cites in support of this holding a long array of authorities.\u00a0 Before proceeding to inquire into the soundness of\u00a0 these holdings,\u00a0 it is well\u00a0 to\u00a0 carefully examine the allegations in relator's petition, bearing in mind that the questions in the case have been decided upon respondent's demurrer and not upon the merits after trial.\u00a0 It is necessary to here examine briefly the elementary rules of pleading\u00a0 touching demurrers.\u00a0\u00a0 In the case of Alzua et al. <em>vs.<\/em> Johnson (21 Phil. Rep., 308), this court said: <\/p><blockquote>\u00a0 \"While it is\u00a0 sometimes loosely stated that a demurrer admits the truth of all the allegations of fact set out in the complaint, the rule thus broadly stated has many important and well recognized limitations and restrictions.\u00a0 A more accurate statement of the rule is\u00a0 that\u00a0 a demurrer admits the truth of all <em>material and relevant facts which are well pleaded<\/em>.\u00a0 It will readily be seen that the italicized portion of the rule as thus stated modifies the\u00a0 looser and broader statement of the rule to a marked degree.\u00a0 Without stopping to discuss the reasons for the\u00a0 various rules of pleading set out in the following paragraph, we lay them down here, relying upon the reasoning and authority of the cases cited in support\u00a0 of each and all of them.<p><\/p><p>\"A demurrer admits only such matters of\u00a0 fact as are sufficiently pleaded (Com.\u00a0 Dig. Pleader (A 5); 4 la., 63; 14 Ga., 8; 9 Barb., 297; 7 Ark. 282; 6 Wash., 315; 7 Misc. Rep., 1); a demurrer does not admit\u00a0 the truth of\u00a0 mere epithets charging fraud; nor allegations\u00a0 of legal conclusions (144 U. S., 75) ; nor an erroneous statement of law (97 Ala., 491).\u00a0 The admission of the truth\u00a0 of material and relevant facts well pleaded does not extend\u00a0 to render a demurrer an admission of inferences\u00a0 or conclusions drawn therefrom, even if alleged\u00a0 in the pleading;\u00a0 nor mere inferences\u00a0 or conclusions from facts not stated;\u00a0 nor conclusions of law; nor matters\u00a0 of evidence;\u00a0 nor surplusage and irrelevant matter.\u00a0 Furthermore, it is settled that the general rule touching admissions by demurrer does not apply <em>where the court may take judicial notice that\u00a0 the facts alleged are not true; nor does it apply to\u00a0 legally\u00a0 impossible\u00a0 facts; nor to facts which appear unfounded by a record incorporated in\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the pleading, or by a document referred to; nor to general averments contradicted by\u00a0 more specific averments.<\/em>\u00a0\u00a0 So, also,\u00a0 the truth of scandalous matter, inserted merely to insult the opposing party, is not admitted.\u00a0\u00a0 (In support of these propositions see many scores of cases cited in 31 Cyc, 333, 334, 335, 330, and 337, and 6 Enc. PI. &amp; Pr., 334, 335, 336, 337, and 338.)\u00a0 It has\u00a0 been deemed proper to set out these general propositions laid down by the courts of last resort in the United\u00a0 States touching the limitations on the general rule\u00a0 as to admissions by demurrer, because, in this jurisdiction,\u00a0 wherein a new system of procedure has been but lately introduced, the cases thus far decided have not very\u00a0 exhaustively considered the limitations on the\u00a0 rule; and for a clear understanding of this portion of our opinion, it is necessary that these limitations should be kept clearly in mind.\u00a0 But it is proper here to observe that most of these propositions\u00a0 are themselves subject to certain\u00a0 restrictions and limitations\u00a0 in accordance with\u00a0 the\u00a0 varying nature of the infinite variety of conditions to\u00a0 which they\u00a0 are applicable.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>That a demurrer admits the truth of all\u00a0 material and relevant allegations of fact which are well pleaded is settled in this jurisdiction.\u00a0 It, is not necessary to look elsewhere for authority to support this rule.\u00a0 This rule applies as well to mandamus proceedings as it\u00a0 does to\u00a0 any\u00a0 other\u00a0 case. (United States <em>vs<\/em>. County of Clark,\u00a0 95 U. S., 769, 24 L. ed., 545; <em>Ex parte<\/em> Newman, 81 U. S., 152, 20 L. ed., 877.)\u00a0\u00a0 So no one will deny that respondent, by demurring to the petition, admitted as\u00a0 true\u00a0 all of the\u00a0 material allegations contained therein.\u00a0 Now,\u00a0 what are the material allegations? In the majority opinion the court says:<\/p><blockquote>\"It is\u00a0 believed that all\u00a0 of the material allegations of the petition which the relator <em>intended to make,<\/em> eliminating all purely evidential and immaterial allegations, may be fairly stated as follows, to wit:<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/><em>\"First<\/em>, that the relator had been for a period of four years, the superintendent of the Iwahig penal colony.<br\/><p><\/p><p> \"<em>Second<\/em>, that the relator has rendered an account for all property\u00a0 and funds of the Government which have come into his possession.<\/p><p> \"<em>Third<\/em>, that\u00a0 it is the\u00a0 legal duty of the respondent as Auditor for the\u00a0 Philippine Islands to issue an auditor's certificate (clearance) to any employee or agent of the Government who has left the service, when the records of the office of the Auditor show that the accounts of said employee or agent are balanced and that said employee or agent has properly rendered an account for all\u00a0 government property and funds which have come into his possession during the time of said employment.\"\u00a0 <\/p><\/blockquote><p> This third statement is\u00a0 purely a conclusion of law, and can very well be eliminated.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p> \"It is believed that all of the material allegations of the petition which the relator <em>intended to make<\/em>\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 may be fairly stated as follows:\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p> The majority\u00a0 of this court here solemnly assert that they believe that all\u00a0 the material allegations\u00a0 which the relator <em>intended to make<\/em> are:\u00a0 (1) that he had been for four years superintendent of the Iwahig penal colony j and (2)\u00a0 that he has rendered an account for all property and funds of the Government\u00a0 which have come into his possession.\u00a0\u00a0 After reading this petition,\u00a0 which is\u00a0 copied in the\u00a0 majority opinion, I ask, upon what grounds does this court base this belief? Why does the\u00a0 court say it is believed \"all of the material allegations which the relator <em>intended to make?<\/em>\" It is not stated that the relator did not make other material allegations, but\u00a0 that he did not <em>intend<\/em> to do so.\u00a0\u00a0 All will admit that there are other material allegations in the petition, but this court believes that the relator did not intend to make them.\u00a0 The strongest proof obtainable in the world to show that the\u00a0 relator\u00a0 did intend\u00a0 to make these other material allegations is the fact that he did make them, and that they are material.\u00a0 In all the history of jurisprudence which I have yet had an opportunity to examine, I have been unable to\u00a0 find another adjudicated case where the highest court in the land,\u00a0 or any\u00a0 other\u00a0 court, disregarded strong,\u00a0\u00a0 clear, and positive material\u00a0 allegations\u00a0 in a complaint or petition and substituted therefor its (the court's) belief that the plaintiff or relator did not intend to make such allegations.\u00a0 Now, what are these other allegations, and are they material?\u00a0 The relator, in paragraph 3\u00a0 of\u00a0 his petition, states positively that the legal records of the office of the Auditor for the Philippine Islands demonstrate\u00a0 and show that his accounts are <em>balanced <\/em>and that he has properly accounted for all government <em>property<\/em> and funds which have come into his possession during the time he was an employee of the Government.\u00a0 Here the relator not only alleges that he has properly accounted for all government property and funds,\u00a0 but that his accounts\u00a0 are\u00a0 balanced\u00a0 and that the records of the respondent's office show these facts.\u00a0 Then, if the respondent's records show that the\u00a0 relator's accounts have been balanced, it necessarily follows that the respondent has balanced said\u00a0 accounts.\u00a0 Who can say that these allegations are not material to the issues involved in this case ?\u00a0 They are the very foundation upon which the relator bases his right to a certificate of clearance, the propeller of his ship.\u00a0 Take them away and substitute therefor\u00a0 a <em>belief<\/em> and the relator must drift\u00a0 hopelessly upon the high seas of uncertainty.\u00a0 The respondent,\u00a0 by having demurred to the petition, admits that these allegations are true.\u00a0 Again, the court says: <br\/><\/p><blockquote><p> \"Is the mere rendition of accounts of\u00a0 government property and funds by an employee all that is necessary to entitle such employee to\u00a0 his clearance?\u00a0 Is the Auditor,\u00a0 who is responsible for the proper\u00a0 disposition of government property and funds, obliged to accept a mere paper balance? Is the Auditor not to be given an opportunity to count the cash (funds) as well as to see that the property.of the Government actually exists which had been in the\u00a0 possession or under the control of such employee? Is the Auditor not to be given an opportunity to make an actual inspection for the purpose of satisfying his\u00a0 own mind that the paper balance conforms with\u00a0 the\u00a0 actual facts?\u00a0 Experience\u00a0 has taught auditors as well as business men generally that mere paper balances are not always reliable.\u00a0 The actual funds and property are not always visible in such balances.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p><\/blockquote><p> Why talk about mere paper accounts,\u00a0 an opportunity to count funds and see property, and the experience of auditors and business men, when the respondent admits that the relator's accounts have been examined, audited, and balanced, and that the\u00a0 relator has properly accounted for all government funds and property which have come into his possession?\u00a0\u00a0 These matters might come up on a hearing on the merits, but they have no place in the consideration of this case at the present time.<\/p><p> The relator further alleges that his accounts up to March 11, 1911, were\u00a0 \"fully\u00a0 audited and balanced and closed; and said audit\u00a0 has not been revoked or reopened,\" and that on that date he was issued a clearance by the Auditor, and that \"covering the period from March 11, 1911, the date of said clearance,\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 up to and including December 31st, 191 lj the date of the effective acceptance of relator's resignation, relator has accounted for all property and funds of the Government which have come\u00a0 into his possession; and it is not even claimed by the 'Insular Auditor'\u00a0 that he has not done so.\"\u00a0\u00a0 Here the relator again alleges in substance that his accounts have been balanced and that he has accounted for all government funds\u00a0 and property for which he was responsible; that he owes the Government nothing; that the Auditor does not\u00a0 even claim that these allegations are not true.\u00a0\u00a0 Under\u00a0 the pleadings as they now stand, the respondent comes into this court and admits that\u00a0 these allegations\u00a0 are\u00a0 true.\u00a0 This court does not say that the relator has not made these allegations, nor that they are immaterial, nor that the respondent has not admitted that they are true, but the court does say that \"it is believed\" that the relator never \"intended\u00a0 to\u00a0 make\" them.\u00a0 Again, according to the allegations in the petition, which the respondent admits to be true, the reason why the respondent refuses to issue a\u00a0 certificate of clearance\u00a0 to the relator is on account\u00a0 of a \"probable civil suit which might be filed by one Fernandez against the Government.\"\u00a0 Upon this point the court says:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p> \"In fact the relator alleged that the respondent had already acted and had denied his claim (see paragraph 8 of the petition)\u00a0 and gave\u00a0 what seems to be a good\u00a0 reason therefor.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p> Here the court makes a little change in its \"belief.\"\u00a0 Here it finds another material allegation and believes that the relator <em>intended to make it.<\/em>\u00a0 The principal ground, according to the pleadings, upon which the respondent based his decision denying relator's request for a certificate of clearance was this probable civil suit which one Fernandez might file against the Government.\u00a0 This\u00a0 court\u00a0 says that this \"seems to be a good reason.\"\u00a0 The court does not give any reason why it reached the conclusion that this probable civil suit was a good reason for the denial of the relator's request for a certificate of clearance.\u00a0\u00a0 This probable suit is not mentioned anywhere else in the opinion; but I take it, from reading the whole\u00a0 decision,\u00a0 that\u00a0 the foundation for this holding of the court rests upon the proposition\u00a0 that the respondent, in reaching his conclusion upon this point, had to use judgment and discretion.\u00a0 Is this the kind of judgment\u00a0 and discretion which will defeat the relator's right to a writ of mandamus?\u00a0 In answering this question, it must\u00a0 be constantly\u00a0 borne in mind that the personal\u00a0 liberty of the relator is involved.\u00a0 He cannot leave the Philippine Islands to go to his home in the\u00a0 United States.\u00a0 He, for all intents and purposes,\u00a0 is a prisoner and must remain so. On the one side, we have a probable civil suit which might be brought against\u00a0 the Government, and on the other, the personal liberty of\u00a0 a citizen, whose home is in the United States.\u00a0 When\u00a0 the Auditor holds that a probable civil suit against the Government is a good and sufficient reason for denying the relator's request for a certificate of clearance and this court solemnly\u00a0 approves such\u00a0 a holding, and as a consequence, the relator remains a prisoner, is it not beginning to appear that the great and sacred principle contained in the fifth section of the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902, is a \"chain of sand,\"\u00a0 a myth, a delusion, instead of a reality?<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 The\u00a0 relator further alleges that the respondent caused to be instituted against him three charges for malversation of public\u00a0 funds; that the Governor-General\u00a0 ordered the prosecution of these cases\u00a0 discontinued, and that they have been eliminated\u00a0 (dismissed).\u00a0 This court,\u00a0 in the majority opinion, says nothing of these allegations, for\u00a0 the reason, I\u00a0 assume, that, the respondent having admitted that these criminal charges had already been dismissed, the court did not\u00a0 think\u00a0 it necessary\u00a0 to discuss them.\u00a0\u00a0 In\u00a0 this I\u00a0 fully agree.\u00a0 If these criminal charges for the malversation of public funds had not been dismissed before the filing of the\u00a0 petition\u00a0 in the\u00a0 case under consideration, they might have furnished some\u00a0 grounds for the justification of the action of the respondent in declining to issue the certificate of clearance; but as they were dismissed, neither this court nor\u00a0 counsel for respondent now consider them\u00a0 of\u00a0 any importance.\u00a0 And again, the relator alleges that without the certificate\u00a0 of clearance\u00a0 from the respondent, he cannot collect\u00a0 from the Government the amounts due\u00a0 him for accrued leave, salary, and transportation.\u00a0 This court does not\u00a0 directly\u00a0 and specifically\u00a0 discuss the relator's right to have these amounts paid him.\u00a0 But it\u00a0 does discuss at great length the question of the powers and duties of the respondent as Auditor to pass\u00a0 upon all accounts wherein the revenues of the Government are involved, and cites a number of authorities in support of its position in regard to these matters.\u00a0 I must, however, assume that the court had in mind at this\u00a0 time\u00a0 these\u00a0 claims of the\u00a0 relator\u00a0 against the Government, and\u00a0 I\u00a0 insist that as a\u00a0 legal proposition all of that part of the majority opinion which\u00a0 deals with or refers in any manner to\u00a0 claims in favor of or against the Government must rest upon\u00a0 the\u00a0 relator's right to receive the amounts due him for accrued leave,\u00a0 salary, and transportation.\u00a0 Upon what else can that part of the\u00a0 opinion be based, when we remember that the respondent,\u00a0 as I have so often said, admits, by reason of having demurred to the petition, that the relator has properly accounted for all Government funds and property which have come into his possession, and that he does not now\u00a0 owe the Government anything whatsoever?<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 Counsel for the respondent lays down the proposition that \"mandamus will not lie where its\u00a0 primary and underlying motive is a suit against the Government of the Philippine Islands without its consent;\" or, in other words, that the primal motive in instituting this action is not so much\u00a0 to secure a clearance as to\u00a0 enable the relator to receive his accrued leave, salary, and\u00a0 transportation;\u00a0 and if this court should order the respondent to issue a certificate of clearance to the relator, it would be sanctioning a suit not\u00a0 brought directly against an official\u00a0 personally, or even officially, but against the Government of the Philippine Islands, without its consent, as it would necessarily follow that these claims of the relator for accrued leave, salary, and transportation would have to be paid.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 In\u00a0 the final analysis, the\u00a0 whole case, up to\u00a0 this point, is narrowed down\u00a0 to one question only; that is, Can the courts control by mandamus the\u00a0 judgment and the discretion which were exercised by the respondent when he denied the relator's request\u00a0 for a certificate\u00a0 of clearance upon\u00a0 the grounds (1) that a probable civil suit might be brought by one Fernandez against the Government, and (2)\u00a0 that the\u00a0 Government, in\u00a0 all probability, would have to pay the claims of the relator for leave, salary, and transportation?\u00a0\u00a0 I\u00a0 shall now attempt to demonstrate that this question\u00a0 is, upon\u00a0 sound legal\u00a0 principles,\u00a0 to be\u00a0 answered in the affirmative,\u00a0 and in so doing, I shall disregard as inapplicable all the authorities cited in the majority opinion which tend to\u00a0 support the\u00a0 general proposition that the decision of the Auditor upon matters pertaining to the settlement of bonded officers' accounts is\u00a0 final and conclusive, because the accounts of the relator as superintendent Of\u00a0 the Iwahig Penal Colony have been,\u00a0 according\u00a0 to the pleadings, balanced, leaving the relator owing the Government nothing.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 That one Fernandez cannot sue the Government in a civil action without its consent is well known by everyone. Then, why should\u00a0 the respondent be allowed\u00a0 to hold up the claims of the relator for\u00a0 accrued leave, salary,\u00a0 and transportation on this ground?\u00a0\u00a0 In deciding to do so, what kind of judgment and discretion did he use?<\/p><blockquote>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"After at least two years' continuous, faithful, and satisfactory service,\u00a0 the Governor-General or proper head of Department shall,\u00a0 subject to the necessities of\u00a0 the\u00a0 public service, and upon\u00a0 proper application\u00a0 therefor,\u00a0 grant each regularly and permanently appointed officer or employee in the\u00a0 civil service, Insular or provincial,\u00a0 or of the city of Manila,\u00a0 except\u00a0 as\u00a0 hereinafter\u00a0 provided, accrued leave of absence with full pay, inclusive of\u00a0 Sundays and of days declared public holidays by law or executive order, for each year of service in accordance with the following schedule: *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 (Sec. 23 (a), Act No. 1698.)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <p>\"If an\u00a0 officer or employee elects to postpone\u00a0 the taking of any or all\u00a0 of the leave to\u00a0 which\u00a0 he is\u00a0 entitled\u00a0 under this section, such leave may accumulate and if\u00a0 his salary changes he shall\u00a0 receive the same amount of leave and pay as if he had taken the leave while receiving the\u00a0 salary at which it accrued: <em>Provided, however,<\/em> That\u00a0 after January first, nineteen hundred and five, no person shall at any time have to his credit more than the accrued leave allowed\u00a0 for five\u00a0 years' service.\u00a0\u00a0 (<em>Idem (b), idem.<\/em>)<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>\"An officer or\u00a0 employee separated from the service for cause, or who commits an act which requires his separation from the service, shall not be granted leave\u00a0 or any of the other privileges provided in this section and in the following sections.\u00a0 (<em>Idem\u00a0 (h), idem<\/em>.)<br\/><br\/>\"Irrespective of\u00a0 leave\u00a0 granted,\u00a0 a\u00a0 regularly\u00a0 appointed officer or employee\u00a0 who has rendered continuous, faithful, and\u00a0 satisfactory service for three years or more after arrival in the Philippine Islands, shall, upon\u00a0 his retirement from the\u00a0 service,\u00a0 be allowed Half\u00a0 salary for thirty days in addition\u00a0 to\u00a0 full salary for the period which\u00a0 may be granted him as leave of absence under\u00a0 the provisions of this Act; and if appointed prior to January twelfth, nineteen hundred and\u00a0 four, he shall also be furnished transportation from\u00a0 Manila to San Francisco,\u00a0 or\u00a0 transportation of equal cost to the Government by any other route:\u00a0 Provided, That\u00a0 such transportation must\u00a0 be used within six months after retirement from the service.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Sec.\u00a0 29 <em>(<\/em><em>d), idem<\/em>.) <\/p><\/blockquote>\u00a0 The\u00a0 accrued\u00a0 leave, salary, and\u00a0 transportation of\u00a0 the relator\u00a0 as\u00a0 superintendent\u00a0 of\u00a0 the Penal Colony were fixed under express authority of law, and the appropriation act provides the funds for the payment of the\u00a0 same.\u00a0\u00a0 Again I\u00a0 ask, what\u00a0 kind of Judgment and discretion did the respondent use in deciding that these claims\u00a0 should not be paid?\u00a0\u00a0 According to\u00a0 the doctrine laid down by this\u00a0 court the respondent must necessarily and did use\u00a0 judgment and discretion in deciding all of these questions, and, therefore, his decision\u00a0 in these matters can not be reviewed by\u00a0 the courts nor controlled by mandamus.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 The writ of mandamus is a judicial writ and part of the recognized course of legal proceedings and is a writ of right. Two things must concur to authorize a writ of mandamus: the officer to whom it is directed must be\u00a0 one to whom, on legal principles, such writ can be issued; and the person applying for it\u00a0 must be without any other\u00a0 plain,\u00a0 speedy, and adequate remedy.\u00a0 The writ does not issue as a matter of course.\u00a0 It will\u00a0 issue only where there is a clear legal right sought\u00a0 to be enforced.\u00a0\u00a0 It will not issue to enforce a doubtful right.\u00a0 The\u00a0 writ lies to enforce\u00a0 individual rights arising\u00a0 under the\u00a0 laws of the Philippine\u00a0 Islands.\u00a0 The grounds for mandamus have gradually been extended.\u00a0 (<em>Ex parte<\/em> Virginia, 100 U.

The province of the\u00a0 court is to decide on the right of individuals;\u00a0 not to\u00a0 inquire\u00a0 how the\u00a0 executive or executive officers perform duties which are in tfreir nature political. The courts have no jurisdiction to decide whether a foreign country has become an\u00a0 independent state\u00a0 (Kennett <em>vs.<\/em> Chambers, 14\u00a0 How., 38, 14 L. ed., 316); nor to deal\u00a0 with the admission of a state into the Union (Luther <em>vs.<\/em> Borden, 7 How., 1,\u00a0 12 L. ed., 581); nor of the restoration of a state lately in rebellion (Georgia <em>vs<\/em>. Stanton, 6 Wall., 50,\u00a0 18 L. ed., 721).\u00a0 All these questions are for the political or legislative departments and the courts cannot settle them.\u00a0\u00a0 The decisions of such\u00a0 officers in these matters are\u00a0 final.\u00a0\u00a0 But where the acts of executive officers involve the interpretation of the constitution or the laws they\u00a0 are, under certain circumstances, subject to review by the courts.\u00a0 It is\u00a0 often difficult to\u00a0 define in exact terms what the duties of public officers are.\u00a0 In such cases that which is incapable of exact definition\u00a0 is left\u00a0 to the officer's discretion.\u00a0 Probably as strong a statement of the refusal of the courts to interfere with the exercise of the duties imposed upon public officers as can be found is stated by the court in Riverside Oil Co. <em>vs<\/em>. Hitchcock (190 U. S., 316, 47 L. ed., 1074), and which is quoted with approval in the recent case of United States ex rel Ness vs. Fisher, decided March 11,\u00a0 1912, and reported in Advance Sheets\u00a0 No. 10, at page 356.\u00a0 The majority opinion rests largely upon these two cases.\u00a0 In the Riverside Oil case, one C. W. Clark was the owner in fee of certain lands in the state of Oregon, covered by a patent from the United States to his grantors.\u00a0 The land was situated in a forest reserve iri that state.\u00a0 On the 28th of October, 1898, Clark executed a deed which conveyed in fee and relinquished to the United States said land. Certain other public lands were\u00a0 thereupon selected\u00a0 by\u00a0 Clark\u00a0 which\u00a0 had\u00a0 been\u00a0 duly surveyed and classified as agricultural lands prior\u00a0 to the selection, and appeared on the records of the Land Department as such and were subject to disposition under the Act of June 4, 1897.\u00a0\u00a0 The Land Department required Clark to publish a notice of his selection for a period of sixty days. Clark complied with these requirements and on February 6, 1900, before the sixty\u00a0 days had\u00a0 expired, the Kern Oil Company filed a protest against this selection.\u00a0 On January 2, 1900, Clark\u00a0 conveyed by deed the selected land\u00a0 to the Riverside Oil Company,\u00a0 This company then filed a motion to dismiss the protest.\u00a0 A\u00a0 hearing was had before the Commissioner of the General\u00a0 Land Office, and his decision in the matter was that the title of the selector did not pass until approval by the commissioner,\u00a0 and that the land included in the selection was yet open to exploration under the mining laws, and if, at the date of the decision,\u00a0 the land is shown to be mineral, it defeats the selection.\u00a0 The land\u00a0 was not passed to patent.\u00a0 This decision was sustained by the commissioner's\u00a0 superiors.\u00a0\u00a0 The Riverside Oil Company filed a petition asking for a writ\u00a0 of mandamus to compel the Secretary of the Interior to\u00a0 vacate the order made\u00a0 by\u00a0 him rejecting the selection of Clark and\u00a0 to order such selection passed to patent.\u00a0 The Secretary of the Interior\u00a0 decided, after hearing all the parties, that the land selected\u00a0 was not \"vacant\u00a0 land.\"\u00a0 The petitioner urged that\u00a0 the\u00a0 Secretary erred in\u00a0 holding that a discovery of mineral upon the land selected,\u00a0 subsequent to the\u00a0 selection and before approval by the commissioner, would defeat such selection.\u00a0 This holding was\u00a0 not only a\u00a0 reasonable interpretation\u00a0 of the law, but it appears to be a\u00a0 correct interpretation.\u00a0 So this case is clearly distinguishable from\u00a0 that of Ballinger <em>vs<\/em>. United States <em>ex rel<\/em>. Frost (216 U.

Ness vs. Fisher,<em> supra<\/em>, Mary S. Ness, being desirous of purchasing some land under the Timber and Stone Act, filed in the proper land office a written application in which she\u00a0 stated that the land described in her petition\u00a0 was unfit for cultivation, valuable chiefly for its timber, uninhabited, and contained no mining or other improvements.\u00a0\u00a0 She swore to this petition.\u00a0 In the investigation it developed that the petitioner had never been upon the\u00a0 land described in her petition and that she\u00a0 made the\u00a0 above averments upon information\u00a0 and belief.\u00a0\u00a0 The local land officer dismissed the petition.\u00a0 The Commissioner of the General Land Office and the Secretary\u00a0 of the Interior affirmed this decision.\u00a0 Mary S. Ness then filed a petition asking for a writ of mandamus to compel the Secretary of the Interior to accept, as conforming to the Timber and Stone Act, her\u00a0 application.\u00a0 The\u00a0 writ was\u00a0 denied.\u00a0\u00a0 The local land officer, the Commissioner, and the Secretary of the Interior all held that the averments of the petition filed in the local land office that the land which relator sought to purchase was unfit for cultivation, valuable chiefly for its timber, uninhabited, and contained no\u00a0 mining or other improvements, must be made upon personal examination and inspection and not upon information and belief.\u00a0 This had\u00a0 been the repeated construction of the law by\u00a0 the\u00a0 Secretary of the Interior.\u00a0 The Supreme Court said:<\/p><blockquote><p> \"That the Secretary's\u00a0 decision\u00a0 rejecting the relator's application was not arbitrary or capricious bu,t was based upon a construction of section 2 which was at least a possible one, had long prevailed in the Land Department, had been approved\u00a0 in the United\u00a0 States\u00a0 vs. Wood\u00a0 (70 Fed., 485), and Hoover <em>vs.<\/em> Sailing (102 Fed., 716), and has since been sustained\u00a0 by the Court of Appeals in the present case.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p> While the Supreme Court did not specifically and directly decide that this was the proper interpretation of the law, yet it did decide that it was not an arbitrary or capricious interpretation.\u00a0 So this case is likewise distinguishable from the Ballinger case and leaves the doctrine laid down in that case in full force and effect.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 The rule that courts will not interfere where a public officer exercises discretion vested in him by law, was laid down in the early period of American jurisprudence.\u00a0 At that time there was present in the minds of all men the fear and the abhorrence of a government in which the ultimate power might become vested in one particular branch.\u00a0 Having just escaped from such a government at a great sacrifice,\u00a0 the American people determined to so divide the powers of government that it would be impossible for any one man or set of men to control\u00a0 the whole\u00a0 system.\u00a0 In keeping with this policy, the courts early refused to attempt to review or revise the acts of the other departments.\u00a0 It was reasoned that if the courts were the final reviewing power in those cases where another branch of the government was vested with discretion, it would\u00a0 in effect make that branch the\u00a0 mere passive servant of the judiciary.\u00a0\u00a0 The fallacy of this reasoning has long since been demonstrated.\u00a0\u00a0 Instead of regarding the three departments of government as independent, they are now considered as coordinate, and the whole system is regarded as one of checks and balances.\u00a0\u00a0 Cases very quickly arose in which officers were disregarding a reasonable construction of the law, and in fact abusing the discretionary power conferred upon them, to the injury of\u00a0 individual rights.\u00a0 In an endeavor\u00a0 to adhere to the rule as first laid down and yet reach the offenders, it was necessary tq classify the duties sought to be enforced as ministerial.\u00a0 The fiction still\u00a0 prevails in many jurisdictions that courts\u00a0 will not review or control\u00a0 such discretion, while at\u00a0 the same time its arbitrary and abusive exercise is constantly\u00a0 being corrected\u00a0 and\u00a0 controlled by\u00a0 the courts under the guise of a ministerial\u00a0 duty.\u00a0 This\u00a0 applies only to those cases where the officer has acted, and not to the cases where he refuses to act, for the rule is still true that where the law vests discretion in an officer and he refuses to exercise it, the .\u00a0 only function of the court by\u00a0 a writ of mandamus is to \"set him in motion.\"\u00a0 The Supreme Court of the United States has\u00a0 consistently\u00a0 adhered to the\u00a0 ministerial-discretionary classification of duties of public officers.\u00a0\u00a0 But it is said that the courts very often denominate a discretionary duty as a ministerial duty in order to take jurisdiction in those cases where a public officer has acted\u00a0 in\u00a0 a manner\u00a0 not in\u00a0 accordance with the intent of the law.<\/p><p> In\u00a0 the\u00a0 United States\u00a0 <em>ex rel.<\/em> Steinmetz vs.\u00a0 Allen (192 U.

The court dismissed the petition and its action was\u00a0 affirmed by the court of appeals.\u00a0 The case then went to the Supreme Court of the United States, where the decisions of the two lower courts were reversed and an order issued directing the granting of the mandamus.\u00a0 In this case the Supreme Court said in part:<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 \"In Bennet <em>vs.<\/em> Fowler (8 Wall.,\u00a0 445,\u00a0 19 L.\u00a0 ed., 431), a discretion\u00a0 in the Patent Office was recognized.\u00a0\u00a0 The question arose upon the validity of two\u00a0 reissued patents for improvements, which 'had been embraced in one, in the original patent.'\u00a0 The court said:<\/p><blockquote>\u00a0\" 'It may\u00a0 be that if the improvements set forth in both specifications had been incorporated\u00a0 into one patent, the patentee taking care to protect himself as to all his improvements by proper and several claims, it\u00a0 would have been sufficient.\u00a0 It is difficult, perhaps\u00a0 impossible, to lay down any general\u00a0 rule by which to determine when a given invention\u00a0 or improvements shall be embraced in one,\u00a0 two,\u00a0 or more\u00a0 patents.\u00a0 Some discretion must necessarily be left\u00a0 on this subject\u00a0 to the head of the Patent Office.\u00a0 It is often a nice and perplexing question.'<p><\/p><p>\"Some discretion is not an unlimited discretion, and\u00a0 if the discretion be\u00a0 not unlimited it is reviewable.\u00a0 In other words, the statute\u00a0 gives the right to join inventions\u00a0 in one application in cases where the inventions are related, and it cannot\u00a0 be denied by a hard and fixed rule which prevents such\u00a0 a joinder in all cases.\u00a0\u00a0 Such a rule is not the exercise of discretion; it is a determination not to hear. No inventor can reach the point of invoking the\u00a0 discretion of the Patent Office.\u00a0 He is notified in advance that he will not\u00a0 be heard, no matter what he might be able to show.

This\u00a0 same author, in\u00a0 sections 40\u00a0 and 41, recognizes the authority of the courts to control the actions of officers when there is an\u00a0 abuse of discretion.\u00a0 But\u00a0 he says before the court should interfere the proof must be very clear and convincing that\u00a0 such an officer has grossly abused the discretion conferred upon him.<\/p><p> Again, the court cites and quotes from Mr. Sanborn's article on mandamus, but the court did not quote\u00a0 the following from Judge Sanborn's article on mandamus, wherein he says:<\/p><blockquote><p> \"An exception to the general rule that discretionary acts will not be reviewed or controlled exists when the discretion has been abused, for example mandamus may in a\u00a0 case be granted where\u00a0 the action has been arbitrary or capricious or from personal selfish motives, or where it amounts to an evasion Qf a positive duty, or there has been a refusal to consider pertinent evidence, hear tjie parties when so required, or to entertain any proper question concerning the exercise of the discretion.\u00a0 Likewise it has been held that mandamus may issue where discretion has been exercised on questions not properly\u00a0 within it, or where the action is based upon reason outside the discretion\u00a0 imposed.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (26 Cyc, 161.)<\/p><\/blockquote><p> So this learned author also is in accord with the holdings of the various courts as above set forth.<\/p><p> Where anything is left to any person to be done according to his discretion, the law intends it\u00a0 must be done with a sound discretion and according to law.\u00a0 The discretion conferred upon officers by law is not a capricious or arbitrary discretion, but an impartial discretion guided and controlled in its exercise by fixed legal principles.\u00a0 It is not a mental discretion to be exercised <em>ex gratia, <\/em>but a legal discretion to be exercised in conformity with the spirit of the law, and in a manner to subserve and not to impede or defeat the ends of substantial justice.<\/p><p> As a matter of fact, it is necessary for a public officer to exercise his own discretion and judgment as to whether a certain state of facts exists, even in the performance of a so-called ministerial duty.<\/p><blockquote><p> \"The duty is ministerial when it is\u00a0 to be performed upon a certain state of facts, although the officer or tribunal or body must judge according to their best discretion whether the facts exist, and whether they should perform the act. Otherwise it is obvious\u00a0 no mandamus cotild ever lie in any case.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (26 Cyc, 161, note 10.)<\/p><\/blockquote><p> If, then, the officer must determine whether a certain state of facts actually exists before he can perform a\u00a0 \"purely ministerial\" duty, it would seem that the only difference between the discretion which he thus exercises and that conferred upon him by express\u00a0 law is one of degree and not of kind.\u00a0 In the laws the duties of every officer are outlined as completely as human skill can do it.\u00a0 Yet, in the nature of things, doubts often arise as to what is the correct procedure under the laws.\u00a0 A public officer, on taking office, must necessarily be the first to interpret the laws relating to his position.\u00a0 When the time arrives for him to perform any one of his duties, he must first act or refuse to act before anyone else can take jurisdiction.\u00a0 Some of the duties prescribed for him by the\u00a0 laws are\u00a0 so plain as to practically admit of no argument\u00a0\u00a0 These are generally called ministerial duties.\u00a0\u00a0 Still, it requires the exercise of personal judgment to decide on the time, manner, and extent of performance.\u00a0 From\u00a0 these well-defined\u00a0 duties,\u00a0 which involve the exercise of so little judgment and discretion on the part of the officer, to those which may be performed in any one of a number of different ways, and therefore necessarily requiring a high degree of judgment, sagacity, and prudence in their performance, is a long step.\u00a0\u00a0 But where can the line be drawn?\u00a0 The plainest and best defined\u00a0 duty of an officer requires that he recognize it as such.\u00a0 He must satisfy himself that\u00a0 the facts of the case combine in such\u00a0 a way\u00a0 as to require its performance.\u00a0 Such being\u00a0 the\u00a0 case, the division\u00a0 of his duties into those ministerial\u00a0 (that is, those very plain and well defined), and those discretionary (that is, those very hard or impossible to exactly define), serves only to confuse the mind and to establish a division of his duties which leaves a large share of them open to profitless dispute.\u00a0\u00a0 It is\u00a0 much nearer the truth to say that a public officer exercises his own\u00a0 discretion and judgment in the discharge\u00a0 of all his duties.\u00a0 He interprets\u00a0 the law affecting him in the exercise of his official powers and acts according to that interpretation.\u00a0\u00a0 If a dispute arises as to whether he has correctly interpreted the\u00a0 law applying to a particular\u00a0 case,\u00a0 his action is subject to review by the courts,\u00a0 it being their duty to construe the law.\u00a0 It must not be assumed, however, that a person who is dissatisfied with\u00a0 the\u00a0 performance of a\u00a0 duty by a public officer will always obtain relief by mandamus.\u00a0 Nothing could be more impracticable or foolish than to impose upon the judiciary the task of reviewing every decision of fact and law made by public officers in the discharge of their duties.\u00a0 They are presumed to exercise their powers in a legal and equitable manner.\u00a0 To encourage disgruntled claimants to press their claims in court would be to virtually transact all the business of the government in court.\u00a0 Such\u00a0 would be\u00a0 the\u00a0 result if the courts undertook to review the merits of\u00a0 every controversy\u00a0 settled by public officers.\u00a0 For\u00a0 slight errors of judgment on the part of public officers there can be, in the nature of things,\u00a0 no redress for the individual in the courts.\u00a0 In reviewing such acts on a petition for mandamus, courts require the relator to prove his case by much more than a mere preponderance of evidence.\u00a0 The abuse of official discretion must\u00a0 be\u00a0 manifest.\u00a0 It must\u00a0 be\u00a0 clear that the officer has\u00a0 acted in an arbitrary and\u00a0 illegal manner. The facts upon which relator bases his petition must combine in such a way that it will be evident that the law and equity require that he be granted that for which he prays.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 The majority opinion states that for the courts to compel the Auditor to allow, or disallow a claim against or in favor of the Government would be to substitute the courts as the accounting officers of the Government.\u00a0 How many claims, reviewed\u00a0 by the courts under a method which requires the claimant to produce such a great preponderance of evidence, will be allowed\u00a0 against the decision of the Auditor?\u00a0 The Auditor passes\u00a0 upon thousands\u00a0 of claims every year.\u00a0\u00a0 If the courts, adhering to this rule\u00a0 of evidence, were to overrule the Auditor in such a number of cases as to amount to a\u00a0 substitution, what manner of man would the Auditor be? Or would\u00a0 overruling his decisions in one instance or twenty instances\u00a0 out of thousands be a\u00a0 substitution of the courts for the Auditor?\u00a0 Restricted as\u00a0 the writ of mandamus is by the rules of evidence I have just stated, the Auditor, or any other\u00a0 public officer, has far more latitude in guiding his official conduct and performing his official duties than have the judicial bodies whose decisions are subject\u00a0 to review by an appellate tribunal.\u00a0 The decisions of lower courts are reviewed in the higher court by a strict preponderance-of-evidence rule (in\u00a0 civi]\u00a0 cases).\u00a0 Nevertheless, can it be asserted that the appellate tribunal is a virtual substitution for those lower courts?\u00a0 How many cases,\u00a0 out of all those decided by the judicial\u00a0 bodies, even\u00a0 with this narrowing of the field of official discretion, reach the appellate tribunal? I think that the fear that the courts will ever usurp the prerogatives of a public officer by the writ of mandamus, issued in proper cases, is groundless.<\/p><p> But it may be argued that in all the cases from which I have quoted above\u00a0 it\u00a0 was found\u00a0 that the\u00a0 officer,\u00a0 board, or tribunal was acting without authority and consequently that that discretion vested in them by law was never exercised until set in motion by the writ of mandamus.\u00a0\u00a0 Upon this reasoning it follows that when\u00a0 the\u00a0 courts review\u00a0 by mandamus the conduct of such an officer, whether the duty is declared to\u00a0 be discretionary\u00a0 or\u00a0 ministerial will depend upon the action the officer has taken: if the courts decide such act is in harmony with the law under which his discretion was granted, they will declare the duty to be of a discretionary character and refuse to interfere; but if they decide that such act is repugnant to the law, they\u00a0 will point out what is the duty of the officer under the law and instruct him to act accordingly. The law intends that the\u00a0 officer shall act with fairness and justice, yet, as I have shown, it is not every slight\u00a0 injustice\u00a0 resulting from an exercise\u00a0 of such discretion which\u00a0 the courts will correct.\u00a0 The\u00a0 courts will not interfere where it is necessary to weigh the evidence and decide on which side a nice preponderance lies.\u00a0 A strict adherence to such a rule would, however, require the courts in every case to go into the merits and decide on which side the preponderance lies,\u00a0 exactly the same as in any ordinary case.\u00a0\u00a0 In the meantime, the\u00a0 officer has, presumably,\u00a0 acted in good faith, according to what he believed to be right and just.\u00a0\u00a0 Yet if the court decides that there has been a wide departure from the intent of the law, it must be held that he acted without discretion.\u00a0\u00a0 In such case, what did prompt him to act? It may be true that he acted without that legal discretion which is\u00a0 all the law can confer upon him.\u00a0\u00a0 But discretion is no concrete thing to be conferred or transferred as a piece\u00a0 of land or a commission to office.\u00a0 It is a trait of character bestowed by nature upon all men in a greater or less degree.\u00a0 If\u00a0 the law permits an officer to\u00a0 act with discretion, he must necessarily use that discretion.\u00a0 He can, in the nature of things, use no other.\u00a0 Legal discretion is, after all, nothing but a man-made standard for measuring and keeping within bounds the <em>personal<\/em> discretion of such public officers.\u00a0 If\u00a0 they fail to make their official acts conform to this standard, they will be called to account.\u00a0 For political or legislative acts, they are responsible directly to the people.\u00a0 But if it be administrative and properly within the jurisdiction of the courts, the courts\u00a0 will provide the remedy.\u00a0 It is, of course, possible that such an officer might not obey the dictates of his own discretion and act in accordance with the promptings of corrupt motives.\u00a0 But in mandamus proceedings\u00a0 there is no legal difference between acts done <em>virtute officio<\/em>and acts done <em>colore officii.<\/em>\u00a0 Thus, a board cannot require other credentials for an applicant to practice medicine than those required by law.\u00a0 (State <em>ex rel<\/em>.

The position of the Auditor for the\u00a0 Philippine Islands is one of great delicacy and difficulty where there is a suspicion of fraud or\u00a0 dishonesty against an officer. He should be allowed to consider not evidence, merely, as recognized in the courts, but suspicions prompted by his own investigation of the officer's accounts,\u00a0 as well\u00a0 as\u00a0 accusations made by others. But the courts have often held that the\u00a0 evidence upon which\u00a0 accounting officers have settled claims\u00a0 in a particular way was insufficient.\u00a0 Thus, in the United States <em>vs.<\/em> Dumas (149 U. S,, 278, 37 L. ed.,\u00a0 734) the Postmaster-General, who was authorized by the law to examine and pass upon the accounts of postmasters; declined to audit the accounts of the defendant in error, claiming that said defendant had made\u00a0 false returns of business done.\u00a0 The court in its\u00a0 decision\u00a0 overruling the decision of\u00a0 the Postmaster-General, quoted the following from United States vs. Barlow (132 U. S., 271, 280, 33 L. ed., 346, 351), per Mr. Justice Field:<\/p><blockquote><p> \"We admit that where matters appertaining to the postal service are left to the discretion\u00a0 and judgment of the Postmaster-General, the exercise of that judgment and discretion cannot\u00a0 in\u00a0 general be interfered with, and the results following\u00a0 defeated.\u00a0 But\u00a0 the very rule supposes\u00a0 that\u00a0 information upon the matters upon which the judgment\u00a0 and discretion are invoked is\u00a0 presented to the officer\u00a0 for consideration, or knowledge\u00a0 respecting them is possessed by him.\u00a0 He\u00a0 is not at liberty, any more than a private agent, to act upon mere guesses and surmises, without information or knowledge on the subject.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p> Here the rule that the accounting officer must have something tangible\u00a0 upon which to base his decision is clearly recognized.\u00a0 Fernandez, as I have said, could not bring a civil suit against the Government without its consent.\u00a0 No argument is necessary\u00a0 to\u00a0 support this proposition.\u00a0 Furthermore, \"the transactions which would form the basis of this probable\u00a0 civil suit fall within the period from September\u00a0 5, 1909, to\u00a0 November 17, 1910,\" and Fernandez had signed vouchers and a warrant of payment, acknowledging to have received in full\u00a0 from the Government the amounts claimed by him.\u00a0 The respondent had issued\u00a0 to the relator a certificate of clearance\u00a0 covering the period from September\u00a0 5, 1909, to\u00a0 November 17, 1910.\u00a0\u00a0 Could the respondent deny the\u00a0 relator's\u00a0 request for a\u00a0 clearance\u00a0 upon\u00a0 this ground\u00a0 and at\u00a0 the same time exercise\u00a0 that legal or official discretion conferred upon him by law?\u00a0 Surely, no one can seriously contend that this\u00a0 could be\u00a0 done, either upon principle or authority.\u00a0\u00a0 And more especially, when it is remembered that the decision\u00a0 of the\u00a0 respondent has\u00a0 the effect of depriving the relator of his liberty.\u00a0 I\u00a0 think\u00a0 judicial notice should be taken of the peculiar conditions existing in this country in\u00a0 the matter of bonded officers of the\u00a0 Government.\u00a0\u00a0 They are continually leaving the Islands, either on leave\u00a0 of absence or on separation from the service.\u00a0 They usually have a large amount due from the Government in the form\u00a0 of accrued leave,\u00a0 salary, and transportation, which they depend upon\u00a0 to defray their expenses.\u00a0\u00a0 The effective date of\u00a0 their resignation or of the commencement\u00a0 of their accrued leave is generally timed a few days in advance of their actual\u00a0 departure from the Islands, so that among the last matters they must arrange before leaving\u00a0 is a clearance from the Auditor.\u00a0\u00a0 For the Auditor to refuse this clearance places these\u00a0 officers in a\u00a0 difficult position and subjects them to great disappointment and more or\u00a0 less pecuniary loss. For these and kindred reasons, such a refusal on the part of the Auditor should\u00a0 not be based upon frivolous pretexts.\u00a0\u00a0 It\u00a0\u00a0 is only justifiable on reasonable grounds.\u00a0 Act\u00a0 No. 1605 makes it a criminal offense for a bonded officer to leave or attempt\u00a0 to\u00a0 leave the Islands without\u00a0 a\u00a0 clearance.\u00a0 It\u00a0 is therefore plain\u00a0 that the Auditor has the power to cause great hardship to all such officers.\u00a0 This power should be exercised wisely and justly.\u00a0 To assert,\u00a0 as the majority opinion does, that the Auditor's action cannot be controlled for any reason in this particular by the courts, is to make that officer the absolute master of the persons of such officers for an almost indefinite length of time, or, as the majority of the court hold, for the period of three\u00a0 years.\u00a0\u00a0 Think of the position of an officer who has separated himself from the service and who is anxious to return to his home being held virtually as a prisoner for the period of three years, awaiting the action of the Auditor.\u00a0 Can such a state of affairs and Act No. 1605 withstand the great principle that no one shall be deprived of life, liberty, or\u00a0 property without due process of law?\u00a0\u00a0 But it is said that if the respondent be compelled to issue this certificate of clearance the Government\u00a0 will have\u00a0 to pay the relator his\u00a0 claims for accrued leave, salary, and transportation, and\u00a0 the result\u00a0 would be that these proceedings against the Auditor would be a suit against the Government without its consent.\u00a0 If it is right and just that these\u00a0 claims should be\u00a0 paid, then who can object?\u00a0 The Government\u00a0 itself has expressly declared in a solemn act that the relator is entitled to and shall receive these amounts.\u00a0\u00a0 The Government has\u00a0 appropriated money for these purposes.\u00a0 It\u00a0 stands ready and willing to make the payments.\u00a0\u00a0 Where the Government, by legislative action, declares that an officer shall\u00a0 receive fixed amounts for his services, such as. salary, accrued leave, and transportation, and where an appropriation is made by the legislature setting aside money for these purposes, an action brought against officers of the Government whose duty it is to countersign warrants or issue certificates, or to actually pay out this money,\u00a0 is not a suit against the Government.\u00a0 It is an action against the respondent officers to compel them to perform\u00a0 a duty imposed upon them by law.\u00a0\u00a0 (Rolsten <em>vs<\/em>.

Rep.,\u00a0 50, note 47.<\/p><p> As has been said, respondent,denied relator's request for a clearance upon the ground that a probable suit might be brought against the Government by one Fernandez and that if he should issue the certificate the result would\u00a0 be that the relator would receive the amounts claimed for accrued leave, salary, and transportation.\u00a0 The Auditor had to\u00a0 exercise some judgment and discretion in reaching this\u00a0 conclusion. According to his interpretation of the law, it was his duty under these facts to deny the relator's request.\u00a0\u00a0 This court says that the Fernandez probable suit \"seems to be a good reason\" for the Auditor's refusal, and that in all these matters relating to claims for or against the Government the Auditor must and does necessarily exercise judgment and discretion which cannot be reviewed nor controlled by the courts.\u00a0 If this were the rule in the United States (it is not, however),\u00a0 there exist well-founded\u00a0 reasons why the rule should be different in this jurisdiction.\u00a0 Among these is the fact that under the provisions of Act No. 1605 the officer is held virtually a prisoner during the pendency of the issuance of his certificate of clearance.\u00a0 There is no such law, either state or national, in the American Union.\u00a0\u00a0 If this Act No. 1605 be held to be constitutional, then the courts\u00a0 must intervene in those cases where a citizen is deprived of his liberty in this manner. Why not say,\u00a0 as it is an absolute fact, that the Auditor, no doubt in good\u00a0 faith, has abused his discretion and erroneously interpreted the law as to his powers and duties, and that this court, being the highest tribunal in this country and being clothed with the power\u00a0 to interpret the laws, not only has the power to intervene, but that it is its sacred and solemn duty to do so.\u00a0 In the majority opinion are cited a long array of cases in support of the court's position that the judgment and discretion of the respondent in these matters cannot be reviewed.\u00a0 I. confidently believe, after an examination of a number of these authorities, that not a\u00a0 single one is applicable to the admitted facts in this case.\u00a0 On the contrary, it is held by practically all of the high courts in the\u00a0 United States that the courts will intervene and\u00a0 control the action of all administrative officers lower than the Chief Executive, where it\u00a0 clearly appears that such officers have grossly abused their discretion or erroneously interpreted the laws, and the injured party has no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy.\u00a0\u00a0 This, at least, is the modern holding of every court\u00a0 of last resort, the decisions of which I have\u00a0 had an opportunity to examine.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 In this jurisdiction, we have an express provision of law (Sec. 222 of Act No.\u00a0 190), authorizing the courts to issue the\u00a0 writ of mandamus to\u00a0 any inferior tribunal, corporation, board, or person.\u00a0 This court has said that it will not interfere with the acts of the\u00a0 Governor-General.\u00a0\u00a0 This holding, as I have said, was based\u00a0 upon political necessity and public policy.\u00a0 But the respondent has no political duties to perform.\u00a0\u00a0 He is not a political officer, and the reasons\u00a0 upon which the decision in the\u00a0 case against the Governor-General rest cannot by any means be extended to the respondent.<\/p><p align=\"center\"> ANOTHER\u00a0 ADEQUATE REMEDY.<\/p><p> This court, in its conclusions, holds that the remedy by appeal provided in Act No.\u00a0 1792 to the aggrieved party to the Governor-General and the Secretary of War is another remedy in the ordinary course of law, and is speedy and adequate\u00a0 and exclusive.\u00a0 Before the promulgation of this decision, the statute read\u00a0 \"in\u00a0 the ordinary <em>courts<\/em>\u00a0 of law.\" But it now reads \"in the ordinary <em>course<\/em> of law.\"\u00a0 If the statute stood in its original form, there could be no\u00a0 question. The offices presided\u00a0 over\u00a0 by\u00a0 the Governor-General and the Secretary of War are not\u00a0 courts of law.\u00a0 Neither an appeal nor writ of error would lie to\u00a0 this court from the decision of the respondent in any case.\u00a0 So the relator not only did not have another\u00a0 plain,\u00a0 speedy,\u00a0 and adequate remedy in the ordinary courts\u00a0 of law, but he had no other remedy whatever in the courts.<\/p><p> We will now examine the question from the standpoint of the article as\u00a0 corrected by the\u00a0 majority opinion.\u00a0 Is the remedy by appeal under Act No. 1792 plain, speedy, and adequate?\u00a0 It\u00a0 appears to\u00a0 be plain,\u00a0 as the procedure is specifically and definitely pointed out.\u00a0 It is adequate, in the sense that the Governor-General\u00a0 and the Secretary of War would doubtless overrule the\u00a0 Auditor if his decision was contrary to law and equity.\u00a0\u00a0 But is it speedy?\u00a0 Before the writ can be denied upon this ground, the remedy must be adequate; it\u00a0 must be\u00a0 plain; and it must be speedy.\u00a0 All three.\u00a0 If either is lacking, the\u00a0 writ must\u00a0 issue.\u00a0 In my opinion, the remedy is neither adequate nor\u00a0 speedy in contemplation of Jaw.\u00a0 The relator being held virtually as a prisoner, seeks complete relief, and\u00a0 that immediately.\u00a0\u00a0 The appeal provided for in Act No, 1792 is that\u00a0 from the decision of the respondent to1 the Secretary of War through the Governor-General.\u00a0 In\u00a0 the\u00a0 ordinary\u00a0 course of the transmittal of official matter, it would take about two months for the appeal to reach the Secretary of War after\u00a0 it had been entered.\u00a0 But a few days must necessarily elapse before the Secretary would pass upon\u00a0 the appeal.\u00a0\u00a0 Then at least forty days more would be required for the Secretary's decision to be returned to the respondent, and if the decision\u00a0 be favorable to the relator, how long would the respondent take in issuing the certificate?\u00a0 He might and could\u00a0 very\u00a0 well, under the decision of this court, refuse absolutely to issue the certificate upon the ground of newly discovered evidence or that in his judgment the interests of the Government required that the accounts as they would then stand balanced should be reopened and reconsidered, notwithstanding that he had been reversed\u00a0 by the Secretary of War.\u00a0 Then another hearing would\u00a0 have\u00a0 to take\u00a0 place; another appeal, and probably\u00a0 another reversal.\u00a0 There would be no end to these appeals, as this\u00a0 court\u00a0 has held that in deciding all questions submitted to the Auditor relative to these matters he must necessarily use and does use such judgment and\u00a0 discretion as cannot be reviewed or\u00a0 revised by the court. How, then, can it be said\u00a0 that such a\u00a0 remedy is speedy?\u00a0 I say again, think of the\u00a0 position of\u00a0 an officer\u00a0 held\u00a0 as\u00a0 a prisoner waiting the final\u00a0 result of this long, uncertain process.\u00a0 Again, should the Secretary of War affirm the decision of the respondent, the relator would be in no better position than he was before the appeal was taken.\u00a0\u00a0 In this the\u00a0 remedy is\u00a0 not adequate.\u00a0\u00a0 Relief is what the relator wants, and not the uncertainties of an appeal.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 In the case of Hoey <em>vs.<\/em> Baldwin (1 Phil.

Law.\u00a0 Rev., 807), says\u00a0 among other things:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p> \"In the\u00a0 judgment\u00a0 of\u00a0 many no\u00a0 more\u00a0 serious evil\u00a0 has developed in our constitutional history than the growing tendency of the courts to stretch the powers devolved upon them by the federal and\u00a0 state\u00a0 constitutions, and usurp the functions\u00a0 of the political departments of the government. Not content with deciding questions of law and fact brought before them in the ordinary course of litigation,\u00a0 the courts have,\u00a0 in\u00a0 many instances,\u00a0 undertaken to\u00a0 legislate.<\/p><\/blockquote><p align=\"center\"> *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<\/p><blockquote><p> \"Judicial\u00a0 power, in its\u00a0 nature,\u00a0 is power to hear\u00a0 and decide causes pending between parties who have the right to sue and be sued in the courts of law and equity.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p> Article 483 of the Penal Code\u00a0 provides that any person who in any case other than that permitted by law or without reasonable grounds therefor shall arrest or detain another person for\u00a0 the\u00a0 purpose of taking the latter before the authorities,\u00a0 shall suffer the penalties of <em>arresto menor<\/em> and a fine.\u00a0 In commenting upon this article, Viada, in volume 3, page 288, says:<\/p><blockquote><p> \"<em>Arresto\u00a0 menor<\/em>, a\u00a0 light penalty\u00a0 under the general scale of penalties set out in article 26,\u00a0 is here applied for the first and only time in\u00a0 this code, to an offense greater than a misdemeanor.\u00a0 It would appear that in place of this offense it was intended to prescribe <em>arresto\u00a0 mayor<\/em>\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p> Speaking\u00a0 in reference to the penalty here imposed by this article, this Supreme Court,\u00a0 in the case of United States <em>vs.<\/em>\u00a0 Fontanilla (11 Phil.

The court did not even indicate in this case that the legistlature did not intend\u00a0 to use the word\u00a0 \"courts.\"\u00a0 I am of the\u00a0 opinion that it is\u00a0 rather late, after the code has\u00a0 been in effect for over ten years,\u00a0 to amend\u00a0 it in\u00a0 this manner.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 Allowing the\u00a0 statute to stand as it was enacted,\u00a0 is it meaningless or nonsensical ?\u00a0 The section provides in effect that when a person shows\u00a0 a\u00a0 departure from duty\u00a0 on the part of an officer, he\u00a0 shall\u00a0 have recourse to mandamus if there is no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary\u00a0 courts of\u00a0 law.\u00a0 Does a\u00a0 strict\u00a0 interpretation\u00a0 of these provisions lead us into impossibilities or improbabilities?\u00a0 If it does not, certainly there can be no reason for going so far as\u00a0 to substitute new words for those used by the legislature.<\/p><blockquote><p> \"1. When the petitioner fails to\u00a0 show a\u00a0 departure from duty the remedial portion of the section cannot be applied by the courts. This is plain.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 \"2. When the petitioner shows a departure from duty but has\u00a0 an appeal to the courts (such as suit on official bond) which is not plain, speedy and adequate, the section applies.

When petitioner\u00a0 shows a departure from duty but has an appeal provided by\u00a0 law through\u00a0 administrative channels which is not plain, speedy,\u00a0 and adequate, this court could logically take jurisdiction on\u00a0 the ground that petitioner's only remedy in the courts is by mandamus and, consequently, that he has no other remedy in the ordinary courts of\u00a0 law.<\/p><p> \"4. When petitioner\u00a0 shows a departure from duty but has an appeal provided by\u00a0 law through\u00a0 administrative channels which is plain, speedy,\u00a0 and adequate, a strict interpretation of section 222 would confer jurisdiction on this court to afford relief if the petitioner elected to take his remedy in this\u00a0 way in preference to\u00a0 his\u00a0 plain, speedy and adequate remedy through administrative\u00a0 channels.\u00a0 Did\u00a0 the\u00a0 legislature intend to provide this duplicate remedy?\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\u00a0 In the majority opinion this court undertook to show that there was\u00a0 a clerical error in the preparation\u00a0 of the code because (1) the section is taken from the California Code which reads \"course of law,\" and\u00a0 (2) section 226 of our own code relating to prohibition reads \"course of law.\"\u00a0\u00a0 I will add another, which is that that provision of a great number of the codes in the tinted States which vests in the courts the power to issue mandamus reads \"course of law.\" In my opinion, all three of these reasons do not show a clerical error in section 222.\u00a0 But let it be said that they do operate to the extent that the legislature had a\u00a0 special purpose\u00a0 in using the word \"courts,\" and, in so doing, that it changed the general rule in the United States,\u00a0 All will admit that the legislature\u00a0 had ample authority to make\u00a0 this change and\u00a0 to confer this power upon the courts.\u00a0 Suppose A, in his petition, should allege a gross abuse of discretion on the part of an officer in the performance of Mis duties and the court find this allegation to be true, and also that A had; another\u00a0 plain, speedy,\u00a0 and adequate remedy in administrative channels. This\u00a0 court, under\u00a0 the powers conferred upon\u00a0 it by the original statute, would iiave Authority to afford\u00a0 the relief, but it does not follow that the\u00a0 court would exercise this power.\u00a0 As a matter of fact, it would not.\u00a0 The statute provides that the\u00a0 court <em>ay<\/em>\u00a0 issue the writ.\u00a0 As I have said, the question as to whether or not the writ of mandamus shall issue\u00a0 rests in every case in the sound discretion of the court.\u00a0 Conferring upon the courts this extra power in mandamus proceedings. is Inot the\u00a0 only departure\u00a0 from the general provisions of the codes in the United States.\u00a0 This court has\u00a0 the power\u00a0 to\u00a0 increase, decrease, modify, etc., penalties in criminal cases.\u00a0\u00a0 No such power is exercised\u00a0 by any of the courts in the American Union.\u00a0 Again, our Courts of First Instance exercise powers in the trial of cases unknown in America.\u00a0\u00a0 So also, the provisions of Act No. 1605 are unknown in the United States.\u00a0\u00a0 This Act\u00a0 is a wide\u00a0\u00a0 departure from the general laws relating to bonded officers in America.\u00a0\u00a0 So it is not strange that this extra power has been conferred upon the courts in mandamus proceedings.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 In my\u00a0 opinion, the use of the\u00a0 word\u00a0 \"courts\" in\u00a0 section 222 is not a clerical error, but a wise piece of legislation, and this court, in amending this section by substituting the word \"course\"\u00a0 has committed the\u00a0 grave, and serious\u00a0 error of taking away from the courts\u00a0 powers which were\u00a0 wisely conferred upon them by the legislature.\u00a0 When the legislature speaks it is our duty to obey.\u00a0 The legitimate province of the courts is to interpret the acts of the legislature as they are found.\u00a0 By so doing, that security\u00a0 of life, liberty,\u00a0 and property, which is the great\u00a0 end of human society and government,\u00a0 will be promoted, and the uncertainties which are sure to follow judicial legislation avoided.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 In this\u00a0 case the relator is now and has been for some time deprived\u00a0 of\u00a0 his liberty\u00a0 without due process of law.\u00a0 He failed to obtain relief in the highest court in the land; the tribunal which has always been regarded as the\u00a0 bulwark of the people's liberties, the\u00a0 guardian of the great principles contained in\u00a0 the instructions of the\u00a0 President to the First Philippine Commission,\u00a0 and\u00a0 the final protector\u00a0 of life and property.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>For the foregoing reasons, I\u00a0 firmly\u00a0 believe\u00a0 that\u00a0 the demurrer should\u00a0 have been\u00a0 overruled\u00a0 and the defendant required to answer.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 <br\/><hr align=\"left\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> Not published.<\/div>",

S. Crossfield.<\/p>\n<p>On  January 20, 1908, counsel  for  the plaintiff  filed a written complaint against the defendant, the administrator of the intestate estate of Walter A. Fitton, now deceased. The said administrator was appointed by an order issued on December  21, 1907, by the aforementioned judge  in  case No.  5103, heard in the Court of First Instance of this  city.<\/p>\n<p>The complaint  alleged:  That until  June 27, 1900, the plaintiff, Antonio M. Pabalan, was the owner  in fee simple of a rural estate consisting of an hacienda known  by the name  of \"Pantayani,\" which was devoted to agricultural purposes, situated on  the roads  leading from  Mariquina to Antipolo,  within  the pueblos of Cainta and Antipolo, Province of Rizal, and which covered an area of 1,978,822 square meters; also a parcel of land consisting.of a building lot situated on Calle Real, of Cainta, measuring 371.30 square meters, the metes and bounds of which were specified  in the complaint; that, on the said  date of June 27, 1900, the plaintiff, desiring to make use of the two properties  described, and lacking the  required means for the purpose entered into an agreement with  the said  Walter A. Fitton whereby they formed a  regular mercantile partnership for  the development of  the said  properties  and for the manufacture and saleyoi their products and other business pertinent thereto; \"That  the sum  of 9,000 pesos Mexican currency  was fixed as the amount of the capital stock of the partnership, of which 3,000 pesos, in cash, were to be contributed by the plaintiff and 6,000 pesos, in real  property, by  the  said  Fitton; that, for  the  purpose of obtaining the said 3,000 pesos, the plaintiff sold his  two aforementioned real properties to the said Walter A. Fitton, the rural estate, shown in Exhibit A, for 5,900 pesos,  and the urban property, described in Exhibit B, for 100  pesos; that the plaintiff received from the  purchaser the sum of 3,000 pesos and the latter, Walter A. Fitton, bound himself    to pay into the funds of the said partnership, as the plaintiff's capital, the remaining 3,000 pesos of the selling price; that it was furthermore  agreed that the two said real properties should constitute the capital of Walter A. Fitton in the partnership, which would be known by the name of \"A. M. Pabalan and Company\" and should be an equivalent for the aforesaid sum of 6,000  pesos; that  all the foregoing facts set forth in the complaint  were recorded in the instrument of sale  and organization  of the partnership; executed on June 27, 1900, before the notary public Rosado, a copy of which was attached to and made an integral part of the complaint; that, from June 27,  1900, up  to the date when the partner Fitton died, the latter failed to pay into the partnership funds the said 3,000 pesos, the remainder of the price of the properties purchased by him, or any part thereof, and did not pay the said sum or any part of the same to the plaintiff; that, since Fitton's death, and up to the date of the filing of the complaint, neither the administrator of the letter's estate nor any  other person had turned into the partnership or paid to the plaintiff the aforesaid 3,000 pe,sos; that, owing to  the  failure  of Fitton to comply with his obligation, the properties in  question had been entirely unproductive  and  losses and  damages had been occasioned to the plaintiff in the sum of 2,000 pesos Philippine currency.  The latter, therefore, prayed for the rescission of the contract entered into, on June 27, 1900, by himself, the plaintiff, and Walter A. Fitton, the dissolution of the partnership \"A. M. Pabalan and Company,\" and  the annulment of the sale of the said properties, by returning to the defendant a sum in  Philippine currency equivalent to the 3,000 pesos in Mexican currency received from Walter A. Fitton, and that the defendant be sentenced to pay to the plaintiff, as losses and damages, the sum of 2,000 pesos, and to the payment of the cost of the suit, in addition to the  other  remedies sought.<\/p>\n<p>The instrument attached  to  the complaint and executed on June 27, 1900, before the notary public Jose M.a Rosado y Calvo,  by Antonio M.

M. Pabalan and Company\" had been unproductive was exclusively due to the great negligence of the plaintiff  since he had had more than sufficient time, from June  27, 1900, to  the date of the death of Fitton, to have  demanded from his copartner the sum  offered by the latter and which he was to contribute to the common assets, and that, notwithstanding all the time that had elapsed since the execution  of the articles of partnership, up to the date of the presentation of the complaint the plaintiff iiad never required his copartner to turn into  the partnership funds the capital  pledged.<\/p>\n<p>The  defendant, in his  cross-complaint and counterclaim, set forth: That, according to the said  articles of partnership, the  plaintiff had  the  management of agricultural matters pertaining to the properties, rural and urban, described therein, and, consequently, was  alone responsible for the successful management  of the company; that, also, according to  the articles of partnership, either of the two partners had  charge of the management,  direction, and administration of  the company; that,  some months after the execution of the said instrument of partnership, Walter A. Fitton was obliged, for reasons of health, to go abroad, where he resided until his death,  and during his absence from this city the plaintiff, Antonio M. Pabalan, with notable negligence and abandonment of the interests of the company, failed to attend to the administration of its affairs and  did not employ on his part any means to  maintain in a productive condition the two properties brought into the partnership by the partner Fitton, and that,  through  the negligence, abandonment, and carelessness of  the plaintiff Pabalan, the defendant suffered losses and damages in the sum of P3,000 Philippine currency; the latter, therefore, prayed that the complaint be dismissed and that, by reason of his cross-complaint and counterclaim, an award be made in his behalf, and against the plaintiff, for losses and damages, in the sum of P3,000  Philippine currency, with  the costs.<\/p>\n<p>By a written motion of March  19, 1909,  Antonio Vasquez represented: That, owing to the death of the plaintiff, the hearing of the case had to be  suspended until, on  the 4th of March, as aforesaid, letters of administration were issued in  his behalf, relative to the estate of the plaintiff Pabalan;  and he therefore prayed that he be  admitted as a party in the capacity of administrator of the estate of the deceased Antonio M. Pabalan.<\/p>\n<p>The case having come to trial on April 29, 1909, with the introduction of oral evidence by counsel for the plaintiff, the court,  on  July 9  of the same yeary pronounced judgment and found  that  the defendantvhad  not  proved any of the damages alleged in his answer, and was not entitled to any recovery  therefor, nor the plaintiff for the taxes that he had paid.  The court ordered a dissolution of  the partnershipiormed between  the plaintiff and the deceased Walter A. Litton and a rescission of the sale and contract of partnership executed between them on July 27,  1900, and further ordered that the defendant, as the administrator of the estate of the said deceased Walter A. Fitton, deliver to the plaintiff, upon the  latter's paying to the defendant, out of the property which belonged to the aforesaid deceased, the sumvof P3,000 Mexican currency, equivalent to P2,700 Philippine currency, the following real properties.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"A. A rural  estate consisting of an haciencla, known as Pantayani or Pantaen, devoted to agriculture and situated on the roads from Mariquina to Antipolo, within the pueblos of Cainta and Antipolo of the old district of  Morong, now Province of Rizal, having an area of 1,978,822 square meters,  bounded on the north by the land of Victor Vargas and the Sucabin  River;  on the east by a  part of the said Sucabin River, a part of the Tabang River, Mount Nagtapong,  the <em>sitio<\/em> of Palenque, and by  another  part of the Tabang River toward the base of Mount Cay-Alaring, Mount Sapang, and  the road leading to the pueblo of Taytay; on the south by the summit of Mount Matugalo, the Paglilingohan  <em>estero<\/em>, the old Cainta  highway, and the,land of Juan Santa Ana; and on the  east by the lands  of Columba Suarez and Mariano Sumulong, the Bulao Road, and the lands of Perfecto Legaspi,  Miguel Gonzalez, Zacarias Gonzalez, Juan Adriano, and of the aforementioned  Juan Santa Ana.<\/p>\n<p>\"B. An urban property consisting of a building lot, without either street or district number, situated on Calle Real in Cainta, a municipality of the Province of Rizal; bounded on its front, which faces the south, by the aforesaid  Calle Real; on its right, upon entering, or on the east, by the lot belonging to Alejandro San Diego and his wife Buenaventura Santos;  on its left, or the west,  by  the  lot of Pablo Ordonez and his wife Dionisia Salandanan; and on its rear, or the north, by the lot of Florencio San  Antonio and his wife Severina Santos, with an area of 361 square meters and: 80 square centimeters.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>This litigation concerns the dissolution of a regular mercantile partnership and the rescission of the sale of certain real properties, the contracts with respect to which were entered into between Antonio M.  Pabalan  y Santos, on one hand, and Walter A.  Fitton, on the other, according to a notarial instrument executed by the contracting parties on July 27, 1900.<\/p>\n<p>The plaintiff's claim is founded  on the alleged fact that the said Walter A. Fitton failed  to comply with his obligations as stipulated in the said double contract,  inasmuch as he did not pay into the funds  of the company entitled \"A. M. Pabalan and Company,\" as the capital of the partner Pabalan, the sum of P3,000, or  the remainder of P6,000, the price of the properties which  he had purchased from the plaintiff,  did not pay to the latter the said amount, nor any part thereof, nor was such payment made, after the said Fitton's death, by the' administrator of the latter's  estate.<\/p>\n<p>Article 1506 of the Civil Code  prescribes :<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The sale shall be rescinded for the  same causes as  all other obligations,\" etc.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Article 1124 provides:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The  right to rescind ttie obligations is  considered  as implied in mutual ones, incase one of the obligated persons does not comply with what is  incumbent upon him.<\/p>\n<p>\"The person prejudiced may choose between  exacting the fulfillment of the obligation or its rescission,  with  indemnity for damages and payment of interest in either case. He may also demand the rescission, even after  having requested its fulfillment, should the latter appear impossible.<\/p>\n<p>\"The court shall order the rescission demanded, unless there are sufficient causes authorizing it to fix  a period.<\/p>\n<p>\"This is understood  without prejudice to the rights  of third acquirers,  in accordance with articles 1295  and 1298, and with the provisions of the Mortgage Law.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Article 116 of the Code of Commerce prescribes:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Articles of association by which  two or more persons obligate themselves to place in a common  fund any property,  industry, or any of these things, in  order  to  obtain profit, shall be commercial, no matter what its class may be, provided it has been established in accordance with the provisions of this code.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>After the organization of the general mercantile partnership denominated \"A. M. Pabalan and Company,\" through the aforesaid  instrument of June  27, 1900, the partner Fitton  did not  turn  into the company funds the sum of P3,000, in the name and to the credit of Pabalan, as the latter's capital,  which sum  was a part of the price of the sale of the two real properties purchased from the said Pabalan by his partner Fitton  who, in turn, brought the said two  parcels of land, as his capital, into the common fund without having paid the said sum up to the  time when he absented himself from these Islands, a few months after the establishment of the partnership, and died  in a foreign country.<\/p>\n<p>It was duly proved at the trial  of this case,  that the partner Walter A. Fitton failed to observe the stipulations of the two aforesaid contracts; that  he did  not pay any part of the price of the sale of the two parcels of land which he had purchased from his partner, Antonio M. Pabalan, and, consequently, did not turn into  the company funds, as capital of the said Pabalan, the sum of which the said price consisted; it is  therefore unquestionable that he did  not comply with his two  principal obligations, assumed in the said double contract wherein he expressly agreed that the said P3,000, a part of the price of the two pieces of  land that he purchased from Pabalan, would be  by him turned into the fund of the general  partnership which they had formed, as capital of  the partner Pabalan. .<\/p>\n<p>In case one of the parties to a contract  does not fulfill his obligation as stipulated therein, the other contracting party, by the provisions of the above-quoted article 1124 of the Civil  Code, is entitled to demand the rescission  of the contract, as such obligations are mutual, and the court must order the rescission  demanded.  The  partner,  Walter A. Fitton, came within such a case, since  he failed to pay any part of the price of the two properties which he had acquired and did not turn into the company fund, as capital of the vendor partner, the sum representing such sale, and therefore  justice requires  the dissolution of the aforementioned company  and the rescission of the said sale, in conformity with the finding contained in  the judgment appealed from and the prayer  rightfully  and  lawfully  made by the partner who did not violate  his  obligations as set forth in the said contract.<\/p>\n<p>During the course of this suit in the Court of First Instance, the plaintiff, Antonio M. Pabalan, also died; and if the latter, while living, was not obliged, according to clause 10 of the articles of partnership,^ continue in the company after the decease of his copartner,  and had a right to withdraw therefrom or from the heirs of the deceased Walter A. Fitton, after the death of the partner Pabalan, neither are the latter's successors in interest obliged to continue in the company, and,  therefore, under this circumstance, the propriety of the judgment appealed from is still more evident.<\/p>\n<p>With respect to the interest on the capital which belonged to Pabalan, and which Fitton failed to turn into the company fund in conformity with the  agreement made, and in regard to the amount of the losses and damages occasioned by the noncompliance, on the part of the partner Fitton, with the stipulated provisions, both such amounts should be considered as the company losses and computed pro rata, in proportion to the extent that each partner is interested in the company and on the same basis as the profits.  (Arts. 140 and 141 of the Code of Commerce.)<\/p>\n<p>As regards the amount of the land tax, which the partner Pabalan had to pay, amounting to P522.30, under the assessment levied upon the two real  properties owned  by the company, inasmuch as the latter is  the owner of the said two parcels of land, which form the assets of the company known as \"A. M. Pabalan and Company,\" it is  unquestionable that this company should have paid the said tax to the Government, and the same being paid by  the partner Pabalan out of his private funds and not of those of the company, he was  solely  entitled  to  be reimbursed for two-thirds  of the said sum paid,  in  proportion,to  the amount of the respective capital. brought in, which two-thirds of  the sum  of  P522.30,  that  is,  P348.20,  may  be deducted from the sum of P2,700 Philippine currency, equivalent  to P3,000 Mexican currency,  which the estate of Antonio  M. Pabalan must restore to the testate or intestate estate of Walter A. Fitton, upon the defendant's returning to the plaintiff the two aforesaid parcels of land.<\/p>\n<p>For the reasons hereinbefore stated, we are of opinion that the judgment appealed from should be and is hereby affirmed, with no special finding as to the costs; provided, however, that the administrator of the estate oMhe deceased Fitton shall  deliver to the administrator of  the  estate  of Pabalan the  two parcels  of  land, the sale of which was rescinded, upon payment by  the last named administrator to that of the estate of Pitton, of the sum of P2,700, equivalent  to 3,000 Mexican pesos,  the said administrator  of the  Pabalan  estate being entitled to deduct from the said sum that of ?348.20, which is two-thirds of the amount paid as land  tax on the properties concerned.  So ordered.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arelleno, C. J., Mapa, Johnson,  Carson, <\/em> and <em>Trent, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<\/p>\n<\/div>",

Seybert, 12 Pa. St., 101, 104.)<\/p><p>The procedure in criminal cases in the Philippine Islands provides that defendant in a criminal proceeding may be a witness in his own behalf. When he avails himself\u00a0 of this right, he is subject to a rigid cross-examination and is bound by his admissions,\u00a0 voluntarily given, in such examination. His admissions are presumed to be given voluntarily and when thus\u00a0 given\u00a0 on a previous trial, they may be used against him in a subsequent cause.\u00a0\u00a0 (State<em> vs<\/em>.\u00a0 Glass, 50 Wis.,\u00a0 218; People v 47 Cal, 125; People <em>vs<\/em>.

H. Bishop; presented a separate complaint in the Court of First Instance against each of the said defendants, charging each of them with the crime of perjury. By agreement\u00a0 between the\u00a0 respective attorneys in the court below, the five cases were consolidated and tried together, the Honorable Charles S. Lobingier, judge.<p>After hearing the evidence, each\u00a0 of the\u00a0 defendants was found\u00a0 guilty of the\u00a0 crime charged\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 complaint, and sentenced to be imprisoned period of\u00a0 six months and to pay a fine of P500, and each was disqualified from holding any public office or giving testimony\u00a0 in any court in\u00a0 the Philippine Islands, until said sentence should be reversed.<\/p><p>From that sentence each of the defendants appealed and made the following assignments of error in this court:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"I. The lower court erred in overruling the demurrer to each of the comp presented by the prosecuting attorney for the city of Manila.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"II.\u00a0 The court erred in holding that the board of special inquiry before the oath was taken was a competent tribunal to hear and determine the case before it.\u00a0 <\/p><p> \"III.

(U. S. <em>vs<\/em>. Salcedo, 4 Phil. Rep., 234.)<\/p><p>It is not necessary, however, to follow the language of the statute in complaint, if the complaint\u00a0 sufficiently describes the crime defined law. (U.

Perjury in the Phil Islands is a statutory offense. A description, therefore, of the offense language of the statute is sufficient. All that is required is that the indictment shall be stated in plain and intelligible terms, with such as to apprise the accused with reasonable certainty of the offense with which he is charged. It must state the substance of the controversy which the false oath was taken, specify the court or officer by whom the false oath was administered, aver or show that such court or officer authority to administer such oath, allege the falsity of the oath, and perjury thereon.<\/p><p>The present prosecution is based upon a violation of section 3 of Act No. 1697 of the Philippine Commission. Said section is as follows:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"Any\u00a0 person who, having taken an oath\u00a0 before a competent tribunal, officer, or person, in any case in which a law of the\u00a0 Philippine Island authorizes an oath to be administered, that he will testify, declare, or certify truly, or that any written testimony, declaration, deposition certificate by him subscribed\u00a0 is true, willfully and contrary to such states or subscribes any material matter which he does not believe to b true, is guilty of perjury, and shall be punished by a fine,\" etc.<\/p><\/blockquote><p>An\u00a0 examination of the complaint above quoted\u00a0 clearly shows that all of the essential elements of the crime described in said section 3 (Act 1697)\u00a0 are included.\u00a0 The facts stated in the complaint are stated wit sufficient clearness and certainty so that those\u00a0 who are charged with crime therein described, if of ordinary understanding, could have no difficulty in fully\u00a0 comprehending: the exact offense with which they charged.<\/p><p>In our judgment the complaint is sufficient.<\/p><p>With reference to the second assignment of error, it will be noted that alleged false oath was given before a board of special inquiry of the department of customs. Said oath was given by each of the defendants in an investigation which said board was holding with reference to the right of three Chinese boys to enter the Philippine. This court has decided in numerous cases that the customs department o the Philippine Islands is charged with the duty of inquiring into and deciding, in the first instance, the right of Chinese to enter the Phi Islands. (<em>In re<\/em> Allen, 2 Phil. Rep., 630; Ngo-Ti vs. Shuster, 355.)<\/p><p>It has also decided in numerous cases that the conclusions of said department of the Government are final upon matters under\u00a0 its jurisdicion when there has been no abuse of authority. (Ngo-Ti <em>vs. <\/em>Shus <em> supra<\/em>; Lo Po vs. McCoy, 8 Phil. Rep., 343.)<\/p><p>Section 21 of\u00a0 Act No. 355 provides\u00a0 that members of said board may be authorized by the Collector of Customs to administer oaths.\u00a0 The record shows that each of the members of said board had been expressly appointed by the Collector of Customs.\u00a0 By that appointment each had a right to act as a member of said\u00a0 board. As members of said board they had a right to inquire into the questions presented in the practice case submitted to\u00a0 it. They had\u00a0 a right to examine witnesses under oath.\u00a0 They had a right to administer an oath to the witnesses examined.\u00a0 Such board, therefore,\u00a0 constituted a tribunal \"in\u00a0 a case which the laws of the Philippine Islands authorized an oath to be administered.\"<\/p><p>The record discloses the\u00a0 fact that during the investigation relating right of the three Chinese boys\u00a0 to enter the Philippine Islands, the of the\u00a0 board was changed, i. e., the same members of the board did not sit continuously during the entire examination. While this is however, it affirmatively appears that all of the members who sat at a one time had been expressly authorized to act. The fact that the personnel of the\u00a0 board was changed from day to day might affect the final\u00a0 decision of the board\u00a0 upon the right of the Chinese boys to the Philippine Islands. We are not, however, called\u00a0 upon to pass upon that question in the present case.\u00a0 It is sufficient, in our opinion, the present criminal action, if the following facts appear:<\/p><p>First. That the board was authorized to make an investigation into the particular questions submitted to it.<\/p><p>Second. That the members of said board were legally authorized to act as members at the time when\u00a0 the alleged false oath was given.<\/p><p>Third. That said board, or members of the same, were duly authorized administer an oath.<\/p><p>We think the record clearly shows that all of the foregoing facts existed and that said board constituted a tribunal, duly authorized in which the laws of the Philippine Islands authorized\u00a0 it, or its administer an oath and that, therefore, any person who, having taken oath before said tribunal that he will testify, declare, depose, or certify truly, and who willfully and contrary to such oath testifies to facts he does not believe to be true, is guilty\u00a0 of perjury.<\/p><p>In our opinion the board before which the alleged false declarations oath were made, was a legally constituted tribunal, under the laws the Philippine Islands, authorized to conduct the investigation which making at the time the said alleged false oaths were given and that said board, or\u00a0 its\u00a0 members, were authorized\u00a0 to and did administer the oat to each of said defendants in accordance with the law.<\/p><p>We find no reason for modifying the sentence of the lower court based upon the\u00a0 second\u00a0 assignment of error.\u00a0 The board was\u00a0 not only\u00a0 a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">de facto<\/span> board, but a <em>de jure<\/em> board.<\/p><p>With reference to the third assignment of error, the following facts are proven beyond a question\u00a0 of reasonable doubt:<\/p><p>It appears from the record that on or about the 25th of November, 1910, on the steamship Yingchow,\u00a0 there arrived at the port of Manila three Chinese boys, of the respective ages of 13, 15, and 21 years and asked permission to enter the Philippine Islands.\u00a0 In support of their right the Islands, the defendants in the present case\u00a0 appeared and gave testimony, under oath, before the board of special inquiry. The defend Marta Sumera (alias\u00a0 Silvestra Rivera)\u00a0 appeared before the\u00a0 board and swore positively that her name was Silvestra Rivera; that the three Chi boys were her children; and that they had been born in the city of Mani and baptized in the Quiapo Church of the city of Manila.<\/p><p>Each of the other defendants, Gervasia Go Chanco, Aniceta Reyes, Carl Ortiz, and\u00a0 Mariano Gabriel,\u00a0 appeared before the board and after being duly sworn,\u00a0 supported\u00a0 by positive and direct declarations, the facts to by the defendant, Marta Sumera (alias Silvestra Rivera). Baptism certificates were\u00a0 presented (see Exhibits C, D, and E), showing that the boys of the same names which these three Chinese boys bore,\u00a0 had been baptized\u00a0 on the dates mentioned in said certificates, in the Quiapo Church of the city of\u00a0 Manila. During the investigation a witness was called was\u00a0 proved to\u00a0 be the real Silvestra Rivera, a woman\u00a0 who\u00a0 had always lived\u00a0 in the city of Manila and who was the real mother of the three boys mentioned in said certificates, who were then and there living in of Manila and whose names were the same which the three Chinese boys had assumed.\u00a0 She swore positively that her three boys had been baptize in the Quiapo Church at the times mentioned in said Exhibits C, D, and her three boys were called as witnesses and their identity was proved beyond question. They had always resided in the city of Manila.\u00a0 There no\u00a0 question that\u00a0 this woman was the real\u00a0 Silvestra Rivera and that t three boys whom she presented as witnesses were her sons and the person mentioned in the three baptismal certificates; that the defendant Marta Sumera\u00a0 (alias Silvestra Rivera) was not the person whom she claimed to to wit,\u00a0 the mother of the three Chinese boys who were seeking admission into the Philippine Islands.\u00a0 The\u00a0 falsity of the oath of each of the defendants, when the entire record is examined, is so glaring that it is to imagine how men and women could have secured the consent of their own conscience to have made them.<\/p><p>Without a further discussion of the facts showing the falsity of the declarations made by the defendants, we find that the\u00a0 record shows, beyond any question of doubt, that the defendants are guilty of the crime charged.<\/p><p>For all of the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of First Instance of the city of\u00a0 Manila is hereby affirmed with reference to each of the defendants, with costs.<\/p><p><em>Arellano, C.

Defendant's counsel appealed from this judgment on the ground that said ordinance was unconstitutional.<\/p><p>The ordinance\u00a0 in question,\u00a0 exhibited on\u00a0 page\u00a0 9 of the record, was pas by the municipal council of Malabon on January\u00a0 5, 1910,\u00a0 and amended at the sessions of the 27th of March and the 14th of June of the\u00a0 same year. It strictly prohibits\u00a0 the game of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">jueteng<\/span> within the limits of the said and prescribes the penalties to be imposed for its violation;\u00a0 and\u00a0 it further provides that any person who shall collect\u00a0 money for wagers on\u00a0 the said game, or who shall keep, make, or prepare any list\u00a0 of numbers, or representative signs thereof, for use\u00a0 in such game, shall be deemed to b collector of <em>jueteng,<\/em> and bankers, those who directly conduct the receive from the collectors the tickets or other contrivances, and are for possession of the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">tambiolos <\/span>or other articles used for the purpose of conducting\u00a0 the said game;

and the said Municipal Code, by providing in\u00a0 section 39 that the municipal council\u00a0 shall provide against evils of gambling, granted it the authority to prohibit gambling games su those specified in the said ordinance;\u00a0 therefore, the municipal council acted within the powers\u00a0 conferred\u00a0 upon it by the Municipal Code\u00a0 and in accordance with the provisions of the said Act No. 1757, since\u00a0 the game <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">jueteng<\/span>, as one of chance absolutely prohibited by the latter, is not sus of regulation, but must be prosecuted and completely suppressed in order avoid repetitions\u00a0 of the great and far reaching social and\u00a0 moral evils been producing in the towns of these\u00a0 Islands.<\/p><p>Hence it is undeniable that the said municipal\u00a0 council, in passing the s ordinance, did not exceed its authority and\u00a0 kept strictly within the pow conferred\u00a0 upon\u00a0 it by\u00a0 its organic law\u00a0 and the\u00a0 general laws\u00a0 that deal with gambling.<\/p><p>With regard to the allegation that the said\u00a0 ordinance is in conflict wit provisions of section 5 of the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902, it must considered that an ordinance has not the character of and is not a genera law, but is merely a regulation of a local nature, and one perfectly valid effective, provided\u00a0 it is\u00a0 in\u00a0 harmony with the general laws in force in Islands.\u00a0 Therefore, it is not\u00a0 indispensable that\u00a0 its\u00a0 subject\u00a0 should in the title,\u00a0 for\u00a0 the provisions of the said\u00a0 Act of Congress\u00a0 refer to general laws that govern in a State and to\u00a0 those enacted in these Island which, indeed, must not embrace more than one subject\u00a0 and that subject must be expressed in the title.\u00a0 This constitutional\u00a0 provision has no ap to municipal ordinances, as these do not partake of the nature of laws, b are\u00a0 mere rules provided for the fulfillment of the laws.\u00a0\u00a0 This principle down in the Encyclopedia of Law and Procedure.\u00a0\u00a0 (Vol. 28, p. 378, and vol. 36, p.\u00a0 1021.)<\/p><p>For the foregoing reasons we deem it proper\u00a0 to affirm and do hereby affirm the judgment appealed from, with the costs\u00a0 against the appellant.<\/p><p><em>Arellano, C.

AURELIO ACEDERA AND VICENTA ADORA, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>ARELLANO, C.J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">Vicente Abad, who claims to be the owner by inheritance of a parcel of land 60 <i>cavanes<\/i> in area in the place and with the boundaries set forth, alleges that in March, 1908, the defendants illegally took possession of a parcel some 23 <i>cavanes<\/i> in area on the east side, adjoining their land, and prays that he be declared the owner of the 23 <i>cavanes<\/i> and that the defendants be sentenced to restore the same to him, with damages and costs.<br\/><br\/>The defendants not only deny the facts in the complaint but they further allege an agreement and a decision in opposition to the plaintiff's claim. The agreement consisted in submitting their contentions to the municipal court of the township of which they are residents, Calapan, Province of Mindoro, on August 18, 1909; and the decision was rendered by the president and members of the township court of Calapan, Mindoro, on the same date, whereby the complaint of Benigno Abac against the defendant Aurelio Acedera was dismissed. (B. of E., 5 and 6.)<br\/><br\/>Such an agreement and decision appear to be legally authorized by Act No. 1397 of the Philippine Commission, which by section 18, subsection (<i>g<\/i>), creates township courts, composed of the president, two councilors, and a secretary, which shall hear and adjudge alleged violations of public ordinances. Subsection (<i>h<\/i>) provides:<br\/><blockquote> \"This court shall have no jurisdiction in civil cases, except on the application of interested parties and upon their making an agreement in writing to accept the award of the court, when it may hear and adjudge any case not involving property exceeding in value the sum of two hundred pesos Philippine currency. The judgment shall be awarded by a majority vote of the members of the court and shall be recorded by the secretary, and shall be <i>final<\/i>.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>On page 5 of the bill of exceptions is recorded an agreement to submit this question about a parcel of land, some 20 <i>cavanes<\/i> in extent, between Benigno Abac, plaintiff, and Vicenta Adora and Aurelio Acedera, defendants\u2014land which the parties appraised at not more than P200. On page 6 appears the decision, the purport whereof in favor of the defendants has already been set forth; wherefore the latter in their cross-complaint pray the Court of First Instance of Mindoro, to which the complaint referred to before was submitted, to sentence the plaintiff to fulfill said agreement, with the costs thereof. (B. of E., 4.) Said Court of First Instance rendered judgment in favor of the defendants, with the costs against the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>On page 14 of the bill of exceptions it appears that the plaintiff asked for a new hearing and, when this was denied, appealed by taking exception, this contrary to what the counsel for the appellees avers in his brief.<br\/><br\/>Accordingly, the plaintiff appealed and has the right to have the evidence reviewed. The appeal is based solely upon the findings of fact in the lower court, but the findings contain no error of fact or of law.<br\/><br\/>The trial court held to be a symbol of ownership, or at least of quiet and peaceful possession, the existence on the land of a house in which the defendants, according to their witnesses and their neighbors, have lived for twentyfive years.<br\/><blockquote> \"Nobody in the whole case\u2014says the learned judge\u2014speaks of the plaintiff as having lived on the lands until he, in rebuttal, went on the stand at the last moment. In his first testimony he did not say a word about having lived on these lands; it only occurred to him to do so after he had heard the defendants establish the fact that they were living thereon * * *. Now I do not for a moment believe the statement of this plaintiff, that he left these lands simply because the defendant had built a house in the southeast corner. It does not stand to reason that he would have given up this large tract of land, in the middle of which he claims that he was living, when somebody had usurped just a small corner in the southeast part of it, in order to avoid trouble. I feel sure that these defendants have been in possession of this land for a number of years * * *. These defendants have been in possession, and, so far as this plaintiff is concerned, he has not attempted to dispossess them. He just moved off the lands and came to town and went to work as a carpenter, he says, to learn the trade; but I suspect the truth is that he was a carpenter and had not been on these lands for many years until after his father died, when he attempted to get possession of them. I do not believe under the testimony, which is nearly all hearsay and guess and a part of it given by witnesses who had not been on the land for five years or more, that this plaintiff has any claim to this land whatsoever.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>This is what the judge saw, heard, and decided; and against his decision so reached nothing has been alleged that can destroy the force of the evidence adduced and duly weighed.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, and the complaint against the defendants dismissed, with the costs against the appellant.<br\/><br\/>It is further ordered, in accordance with the resolution of this court of January 14, 1911, upon written protest of the counsel for the appellant, that the counsel for the appellees strike out and efface on page 4 of his brief the following sentence: \"Se necesita tener un <i>entendimiento demasiado obtuso<\/i> para decir tantos <i>disparates<\/i>.\" The clerk will so enter in the record.<br\/><br\/><i>Carson, Johnson, Moreland<\/i>, and <i>Trent, JJ.<\/i>, concur. <\/div>",

On arriving at the steamer, Lee See, who was on deck, tied a\u00a0 rope around the\u00a0 sack\u00a0 and lowered\u00a0 it\u00a0 into\u00a0 Cabinico's <em>barato<\/em>.\u00a0 The latter, while on his way to the house of the appellant with the sack and its contents, was arrested and the contents\u00a0 of the sack examined, and found to consist of a small amount of sugar and twenty-eight cans of opium. This\u00a0 opium was confiscated by the local authorities and separate criminal charges instituted against the two Chinamen and Cabinico. Upon\u00a0 investigation\u00a0 by the\u00a0 provincial fiscal, the case against\u00a0 Cabinico was dismissed, while those against the two Chinamen were proceeded with, resulting, in the conviction of both.\u00a0 Both appealed, and the sentence imposed upon Lee See has heretofore been affirmed by this court.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>It\u00a0 clearly\u00a0 appears from the record that\u00a0 Cabinico\u00a0 did not know the contents\u00a0 of the sack which he received from Lee See and which he\u00a0 was on his way\u00a0 to\u00a0 deliver to\u00a0 the appellant.\u00a0 It is insisted that it can not be said, under these facts, that\u00a0 the appellant had possession or control of the twenty-eight cans of opium.\u00a0 It is,true that the appellant never had actual physical possession of\u00a0 the opium, but it must be remembered that\u00a0 while\u00a0 he employed Cabinico to go to the steamer and receive, as he said, a certain amount of sugar from his countryman Lee See and bring the same to him, he knew that the sack which Cabinico would receive contained very\u00a0 little sugar and a large quantity of opium. The expression \"having possession of\" in section\u00a0 31\u00a0 of Act No. 1761 is somewhat ambiguous.\u00a0 It is clear that the law never intended to hold a person guilty of the possession of the prescribed drug when in fact\u00a0 he merely had\u00a0 the custody of the\u00a0 same without knowledge of its nature, and this court so held in disposing of the case against Cabinico. But\u00a0 it is equally clear that the law never intended\u00a0 the possession of the drug\u00a0 should be\u00a0 limited to mere manual touch or personal custody.\u00a0\u00a0 Upon\u00a0 such a\u00a0 holding, a guilty principal could often escape by taking the precaution\u00a0 to never have the drug in\u00a0 his actual\u00a0 possession, and thus defeat\u00a0 the intent\u00a0 of the law.\u00a0\u00a0 The words \"having possession of\" must therefore be extended to include constructive possession ; that is, the relation between the owner of the drujy and the\u00a0 drug itself when the owner is not in actual physical. possession, but\u00a0 when it\u00a0 is still under his control and management and subject to his disposition.\u00a0\u00a0 It is\u00a0 immaterial whether Lee See or Chan Guy Juan was\u00a0 the real owner of the opium found in the sack of sugar.\u00a0 The evidence shows both were guilty principals in the\u00a0 effort to land the opium from the steamer.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>Cabinico was the innocent agent of the defendant in this case, and the responsibility for carrying the opium ashore therefore reverts to this defendant.\u00a0 (Art. 13, No. 2,\u00a0 Penal Code; 12 Cyc, 185, and cases cited; Bishop's New Criminal Law, vol. 1, sec. 651.)<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>The judgment of the. lower court is therefore affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/><em>Arellano,\u00a0 C.

I., did willfully, unlawfully, and criminally conspire together, unite\u00a0 and form\u00a0 a band of ladrones with the object of stealing personal property oi all\u00a0 kinds by means of force and violence.\u00a0 They wandered about the highways and committed robberies in the fields\u00a0 and populated portions of said municipality, each and all of them carrying deadly weapons for\u00a0 the\u00a0 purpose stated.\u00a0 Said accused formed a\u00a0 band of ladrones, and on various occasions, within the period before stated, engaged in, executed and carried out various robberies in the houses of Domingo M.\u00a0 Siaceto,\u00a0 Ciriaca Guillermo and\u00a0 Emigdio Mappala,\u00a0 each and all of said accused carrying away some personal property, consisting of various jewels and other articles, the value of which\u00a0 all together\u00a0 is estimated at approximately P372.04, belonging to other persons, against the will of the respective owners thereof.\u00a0 An act committed in violation of the law.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>These\u00a0 defendants\u00a0 were\u00a0 duly\u00a0 arrested\u00a0 and\u00a0 arraigned. Upon arraignment the said Mariano Beltran, Juan Deza and Quirino Deza declared that they were guilty of the crime charged.\u00a0 The other defendants, upon arraignment, declared that they were not guilty.\u00a0 The cause proceeded to trial.\u00a0 Before any testimony\u00a0 was adduced,\u00a0 Senor Concepcion, one of the attorneys for the defendants, presented a motion asking that the cause be dismissed, upon the ground that the defendants were irregularly and illegally before the court for\u00a0 the reason\u00a0 that the record\u00a0 did not disclose that the accused were subjected to a preliminary investigation, in accordance with the law.\u00a0 This motion was overruled by the lower court, and the trial proceeded.<\/p><p>After hearing the evidence adduced\u00a0 during the trial of the cause, the Honorable Carter D. Johnston, judge, found each of the defendants guilty of\u00a0 the\u00a0 crime charged in the complaint and sentenced each to be imprisoned for a period of fifteen years and each to pay one-ninth part of the costs.<\/p><p>From that sentence all of the defendants appealed except Quirino Deza.<\/p><p>During the pendency of the apppeal in this\u00a0 court, the defendants Juan Deza and Mariano Beltran withdrew their appeal and the sentence of the lower court as to them became final upon the 26th of June,\u00a0 1911.\u00a0 The\u00a0 defendant Macario Talusig died in Bilibid Prison\u00a0 on the 31st of May, 1912.\u00a0 The action against him is therefore hereby dismissed with costs de oficio.\u00a0 The only appellants, therefore, in the present case are the following: Enrique\u00a0 Tapiru, Simeon Taccuray, Froilan Gabbauan, Florentino Mappala and Narciso Tagalan.<\/p><p>The attorney for the appellants\u00a0 in this\u00a0 court alleges that the lower court committed the following errors:<\/p><p>First. In\u00a0 qualifying the crime\u00a0 proven as\u00a0 brigandage; and<\/p><p>Second. In holding that the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause shows that the defendants and\u00a0 appellants are guilty of the crime charged in\u00a0 the\u00a0 complaint.<\/p><p>The two assignments of error may be discussed together. In effect the two assignments constitute\u00a0 but\u00a0 one, to wit: that the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause fails to show that the\u00a0 defendants are\u00a0 guilty\u00a0 of the\u00a0 crime\u00a0 of brigandage as charged in the complaint.<\/p><p>During the trial of the cause the prosecution presented six witnesses whose names are as follows: Ciriaca Guillerma, Simeon Sagalig, Domingo\u00a0 Siaceto, Emigdio\u00a0 Mappala, Syguatco Guada, and Quirino Deza.<\/p><p>The said\u00a0 Ciriaco\u00a0 Guillerma testified that on\u00a0 the\u00a0 night of the 22d of September and the 2d of October, 1910, certain merchandise, consisting of jewelry\u00a0 and\u00a0 salted fish, amounting in value to P300, had been forcibly taken\u00a0 from her house or store against her will.<\/p><p>The said Simeon Sagalig testified that\u00a0 he had purchased a jar of fish from the\u00a0 defendant,\u00a0 Juan Deza, for which he had paid P8.30; that the fish was identified by the witness, Ciriaco Guillerma, as the fish which had been taken from her possession.<\/p><p>Domingo Siaceto testified that he was a merchant and that some time before the trial of the cause\u00a0 certain merchandise, consisting of wax, empty\u00a0 jars, iron caldrons, and a tub had been taken from his canteen; that\u00a0 the value of said articles was about P160; that some person had entered his house by force\u00a0 and violence\u00a0 and had carried these articles away without his consent.<\/p><p>The said Emigdio Mappala testified that he was a merchant; that some persons took from\u00a0 his store tobacco leaves, vegetables, and other merchandise; that\u00a0 on the night of the 4th\u00a0 of October,\u00a0 1910,\u00a0 and after the tobacco leaves, vegetables, and other merchandise had been stolen, he was watching to see if the\u00a0 thieves would return\u00a0 to his\u00a0 house and while he was thus watching and waiting, the defendant Juan\u00a0 Deza opened the door\u00a0 of his canteen and with a club in his hand was feeling around inside the canteen; whereupon he\u00a0 (Emigdio Mappala) struck Juan Deza with a bolo and the latter immediately ran away.<\/p><p>Syguatco Guada testified that\u00a0 he was a <em>tienda<\/em> owner; that he purchased\u00a0 from the defendant Juan Deza a number of pieces of jewelry consisting of combs, hairpins, lockets, rings, chains, and\u00a0 both large and small brillantes, and paid therefor\u00a0 the sum of\u00a0 P68.\u00a0 This jewelry was\u00a0 identified as the jewelry which was present in\u00a0 court\u00a0 during the\u00a0 trial and as the same jewelry that belonged to Ciriaca Guillerma, and which had been taken from her house\u00a0 without\u00a0 her consent or knowledge by force and violence.<\/p><p>The next witness sworn on behalf of the prosecution was Quirino Deza, one of the defendants, who swore positively that he, together with the other defendants, had committed seven different robberies during the month of October, 1910, and the months immediately preceding.\u00a0 He testified that he and the other defendants, Juan Deza, Mariano Beltran, Narciso\u00a0 Tagalan,\u00a0 Florentino\u00a0 Mappala, Macario Talusig, Froilan Gabbauan and Simeon Taccuray, had\u00a0 stolen a jar\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 of fish and other merchandise from one,\u00a0 Simeon Sagalig. At this robbery all of the defendants were present,\u00a0 except Enrique Tapiru.<\/p><p>Quirino Deza further testified that on\u00a0 a certain night, he, together with the defendants,\u00a0 Mariano Beltran, Juan Deza, Simeon Taccuray, Froilan Gabbauan, Macario Talusig, Florentino Mappala, and Narciso Tagalan, entered the house of Ciriaco Guillerma and\u00a0 took and carried\u00a0 away, while the occupants of the house were sleeping, a small box containing jewelry, as well as some other merchandise.<\/p><p>It will\u00a0 be noted that the defendant Enrique Tapiru was not present at the time of this robbery.\u00a0 This jewelry,\u00a0 Quirino Deza testified, had been sold by Juan Deza to a Chinaman.\u00a0 Later, according to his\u00a0 declaration,\u00a0 he (Quirino Deza) with some of the\u00a0 defendants went\u00a0 to the house of Domingo\u00a0 Siaceto, and\u00a0 robbed his tienda of wax, jars, caldrons and pots; that at the time of the robbery of the house of Domingo,\u00a0 he, Juan\u00a0 Deza, Enrique Tapiru, Froilan Gabbauan, and Mariano Beltran were present; that a portion of the merchandise taken\u00a0 from the\u00a0 <em>tienda<\/em> of Domingo Siaceto was hidden and a portion of it had been sold\u00a0 to Sanchez Mira.\u00a0 Later, according to the declaration of Quirino Deza, he, together with the defendants, Juan Deza, Froilan Gabbauan, Simeon Taccuray, went\u00a0 to\u00a0 the <em>tienda<\/em> of Emigdio Mappala; that Juan Deza\u00a0 opened the window of the <em>tienda<\/em> and put his hand inside and that some person from within struck and wounded him with a bolo; that the next morning he saw the wound\u00a0 upon the hand of Juan Deza.<\/p><p>It is asserted by\u00a0 the appellants that the testimony of Quirino Deza, he being an accomplice with the other defendants,\u00a0 should not be accepted or at least should be accepted with great caution.\u00a0 It is true that courts should be slow to convict persons charged with\u00a0 crime solely upon the\u00a0 declarations\u00a0 of\u00a0 accomplices.\u00a0\u00a0 In the present\u00a0 case, however, the testimony of Quirino Deza, in every important fact, is to a very great extent supported by\u00a0 the\u00a0 declarations of the other witnesses for the prosecution.\u00a0 It will be\u00a0 noted that\u00a0 his\u00a0 description of the way in which the different robberies were committed, as well as the merchandise and jewelry taken, correspond exactly with the\u00a0 declarations of the\u00a0 different\u00a0 persons who\u00a0 were robbed.\u00a0 In the present case we have no hesitation, by reason of the fact that his testimony\u00a0 is\u00a0 corroborated in almost every detail\u00a0 by the declarations of other witnesses, in accepting the declaration of Quirino Deza.<\/p><p>Juan Deza testified\u00a0 positively that\u00a0 he,\u00a0 together\u00a0 iwitti the\u00a0 other\u00a0 defendants had met on several occasions and agreed upon the commission of the different robberies.<\/p><p>The proof also shows, beyond a reasonable doubt,\u00a0 that the\u00a0 defendants were\u00a0 armed\u00a0 with\u00a0 a bolo,\u00a0 a dagger and clubs.\u00a0\u00a0 The objection is made upon\u00a0 the part of the appellants that\u00a0 the defendants were not armed with deadly weapons.\u00a0\u00a0 This court has held in various cases that where a band is\u00a0 armed with bolos, daggers and clubs that they are armed with deadly weapons.<\/p><p>Act No. 518 as amended by\u00a0 Act No. 1121 (see\u00a0 also Act No. 2036) does\u00a0 not require, in order to constitute the crime of brigandage, that each individual of the band\u00a0 shall be armed\u00a0 with\u00a0 a deadly weapon.\u00a0 While we do not now desire to decide that if one\u00a0 member of a band is armed with a deadly weapon, that that would be sufficient to make a band of brigands armed with deadly weapons, we simply desire to decide that when some members of the band are armed with bolos and daggers and others with clubs, that that is sufficient to make a band of brigands armed\u00a0 with deadly weapons.<\/p><p>The question presented by the defendants in the\u00a0 court below, to wit: that\u00a0 the defendants had\u00a0 not been given a preliminary hearing, seems to have\u00a0 been waived by the appellants; we therefore do\u00a0 not\u00a0 discuss\u00a0 that question at present.<\/p><p>After a careful examination of all of the evidence adduced during the\u00a0 trial of the cause, we\u00a0 find\u00a0 no reason to modify the sentence\u00a0 of the\u00a0 lower\u00a0 court; the same is, therefore, hereby affirmed with costs.<\/p><p>It will be noted that the lower court made a recommendation to the\u00a0 Governor-General of the Philippine Islands for clemency in favor of the defendant, Quirino Deza.\u00a0 In view of what\u00a0 was\u00a0 said by the lower court, and in view\u00a0 of the assistance which Quirino Deza grave to the Government in the trial of\u00a0 the\u00a0 present\u00a0 case, we desire\u00a0 to renew\u00a0 that recommendation.<\/p><p><em>Arellano, C. J., Mapa<\/em> and <em>Trent, JJ.<\/em>,\u00a0 concur.<\/p><p><em>Carson, J.,<\/em>\u00a0 concurs in the result.<\/p><\/div>",

Petitioner  stated that he desired to take the depositions of witnesses in the city of  Cebu, in order to establish the facts set forth by him  and asked that the hearing of the case be set for the month of June, 1907.<\/p>\n<p> A hearing in these proceedings was had on February 20, 1908, after notice had been served on all who might have any interest in the intestate succession concerned, and after the publication of  the decrees for three weeks prior to the date set.   In  view of the  depositions  of witnesses  presented at the  trial, the court,  on March 5, 1908, rendered judgment ordering that the property left by the decedent,  Bernardo Rafanan Lao Sayco, known by the name of Saya, be assigned  to the municipality of Mambajao, Province of Misamis,  to be administered by its municipal council and placed at  the  disposal of  the schools  in  the  same manner as other property intended for the same use.  It was further ordered that the administrator of the intestate estate, after  paying the actual expenses and debts  chargeable thereto, deliver the remainder to  the  municipality of Mambajao, and afterwards  report  to  the  Court of  First Instance his  compliance with and fulfillment  of the order. From this judgment the said administrator and guardian of the minor Lay  Chuyting appealed,  for which purpose a  certified copy of the record was forwarded to the clerk of this court.<\/p>\n\n  This case concerns the reversion to the State of certain property which was left at death by the Chinaman Bernardo Rafanan Lao Sayco, <em>alias<\/em> Saya, who died in the pueblo of Mambajao, Province of Misamis, apparently without having executed any will during his lifetime and without  leaving any known heirs in said locality.<br\/>\n<br\/>\n<p>Section 750  of the  Code of Civil  Procedure, applicable to the case, reads as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p> \"When  a person  dies intestate, seized of  real or  personal property  in the Philippine Islands, leaving no heir or person by law entitled to the same, the president and municipal council  of the municipality where the deceased last resided, if he was an inhabitant of these  Islands, or of the municipality  in which he had estate, if he resided out of the Islands, may, on behalf of the municipality, file a petition with  the Court of First Instance of the  province for an  inquisition in the premises; the court shall thereupon appoint a  time  and place of hearing and  deciding on such petition, and cause a notice thereof to be published in  some newspaper of general circulation in the province of which the deceased was last  an inhabitant, if within the  Philippine Islands, and if not in some newspaper of general circulation in the province in which he  had  estate.   The notice shall recite the substance of the facts and request set forth in the petition, the time and place at which persons  claiming the estate may appear and be heard before the court, and shall be published at least six weeks successive the last of which publications shall be at least six weeks  before  the  time appointed by the court to make inquisition.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>From the record of these proceedings it does not appear that there was made, at the request of counsel for the  president and the municipal council of Mambajao, the inquisition provided by law, specified in the preinserted section, for the record is not accompanied by any certified copy of the inventory of the real and personal .property that belonged to the said decedent, with a statement of the places where the realty is located.  Neither is it shown to have been ascertained whether the deceased Chinaman executed any will during his lifetime, or whether he left  in  Mambajao or  in any other place in these Islands any relative entitled to inherit from  him,  information  in regard to which points might be furnished by those who were his friends or with whom he had friendly  dealings during  his lifetime.   Moreover, the notice summoning the persons who believed they were entitled to his property  should have  been published for at least  six consecutive  weeks,  and not for three  as was directed in the order of December 16, 1907.<\/p>\n<p>In order that the property which belonged to the decedent Bernardo Rafanan  Lao  Sayco, situated  in these Islands, may be  decreed to have reverted to the State, pursuant to the provisions of section 751 of the Code of Civil  Procedure,  it is indispensable that the requirements contained in the above-quoted section of the said code should have been complied with by making the inquisition with regard to the matters specified, at the instance  of the interested municipality.  Furthermore,  the person who lays claim to the property left  by the decedent  at  death, as  the latter's successor or heir, must prove his  identity and  rights.<\/p>\n<br\/>\n  Counsel for the municipality of Mambajao merely prayed for an order of reversion and for the adjudication in behalf     of the municipality of the property aforementioned; he  did not  comply with  the provisions of the  law by furnishing the  required proofs  in regard to  the matters  hereinabove indicated, which must  be the subject of an investigation.<p><\/p>\n<p> For the reasons aforestated, it is proper,  in our opinion, to reverse the judgment  appealed from, and we  dismiss these  proceedings,  without  prejudice to  any  rights that may pertain to the parties with respect to the property in question.   No express finding is made of the costs.<\/p>\n<p> <em> Arellano, C. J.,  Johnson,  Carson, Moreland,<\/em> and <em>Trent, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<\/p>\n<\/div>",

Low,\u00a0 judge, rendered the following sentence:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"The accused, Chong Ting and Ha Kang, having\u00a0 been found guilty as charged, are sentenced each to pay a fine of P300 or to three months' imprisonment.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"It is so ordered.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>From that sentence the defendants appealed and in this court attempt to show that the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause is insufficient to show that they are guilty of the crime charged in the complaint.<\/p><p>During the trial of the cause the prosecuting attorney for the District of Zamboanga presented three witnesses.\u00a0 The first was a Moro called Ambol.\u00a0 He testified that in the month of May, 1911, he was carrying the two defendants in a sailboat.\u00a0 He testified that he had been working for the defendants for forty-five days.\u00a0 He testified that\u00a0 they were\u00a0 sailing their boat to the\u00a0 <em>rancheria<\/em>\u00a0 of Laporawan. He\u00a0 does not state from what place they started.\u00a0 He\u00a0 first tries to make it appear that the defendants were smoking in his boat and that he took possession of certain apparatus and opium ashes from them, for the reason that they would not pay him (supposedly for his labor in managing the sailboat).\u00a0 This witness also tries to make it appear by his declaration that he\u00a0 took the apparatus and\u00a0 opium\u00a0 ashes from the defendants for the reason that he knew that the use of opium was prohibited by\u00a0 law.\u00a0 After\u00a0 he took the apparatus and opium ashes from the defendants he testified that the defendants\u00a0 took\u00a0 the same away from him; that he later obtained possession of the\u00a0 same\u00a0 again and locked the same up in his trunk; that after they landed (and the evidence is very uncertain as to the place where they landed) Ambol testified that he delivered the\u00a0 apparatus\u00a0 and the opium ashes, in company with another Moro called Callava, to Captain Paegelow, some two days after they had landed.<\/p><p>The other\u00a0 witness, Frank S. DeWitt, presented by the prosecuting\u00a0 attorney, was only called for the purpose of showing that the apparatus\u00a0 and opium ashes to which the witness Ambol referred were the apparatus used in smoking opium and that the ashes were in fact opium ashes.<\/p><p>Captain Paegelow was presented by the prosecuting attorney for the purpose of showing\u00a0 that the objects which the witness\u00a0 Ambol claimed\u00a0 he had obtained from the defendants had been delivered\u00a0 to him by the said Ambol.<\/p><p>It will be noted that there is nothing in the testimony of Mr. DeWitt or Captain Paegelow which in any way shows that these defendants had been in the possession of or had been\u00a0 using opium in the\u00a0 manner alleged by\u00a0 the witness Ambol.<\/p><p>Each\u00a0 of the defendants testified in his own behalf.\u00a0\u00a0 The defendant, Chong Ting, stated that he was a merchant and was 27 years of age; that he knew the witness Ambol and had known him since the 19th of April, 1911; that the witness Ambol had been working for him in managing a sailr boat for a period of ten days only, prior to the 28th of April, 1911; that he had not seen the apparatus or articles or the opium ashes to which reference was made by the witness\u00a0 Ambol; that during the voyage\u00a0 in the said\u00a0 sailboat, some question had arisen between him and the witness Ambol relating to the payment of an amount due from one Yap Kang to the said witness.\u00a0 From this it appears that one Yap Kang was also a passenger in the sailboat.\u00a0 This fact does not appear positively but by inference only.<\/p><p>The defendant, Ha\u00a0 Kang,\u00a0 testified in his own behalf. He testified that he was a merchant and was 26\u00a0 years of age; that he lived in the pueblo of Taluysangay; that he knew the witness Ambol; that Ambol had been managing a sailboat for him; that\u00a0 they\u00a0 arrived at\u00a0 the pueblo of Laporawan\u00a0 on the 28th of April; that he\u00a0 had had some trouble with the witness Ambol, with reference to the payment of a sum of money supposedly due for Ambol's labor. He\u00a0 testified positively that the articles (alleged apparatus and opium ashes) had\u00a0 never\u00a0 been in his possession; that the witness\u00a0 Ambol had not taken said articles from him.<\/p><p>The said articles (apparatus for\u00a0 smoking opium\u00a0 and opium ashes) which the witness Ambol alleged he had taken forcibly\u00a0 from the two\u00a0 defendants, .were not\u00a0 presented as proof during the trial of the\u00a0 cause.\u00a0 The record\u00a0 contains the statement:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"The prosecution wishes to\u00a0 present these articles as\u00a0 evidence,\u00a0 marked Exhibit\u00a0 A for the prosecution.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Record, p. 15.)<\/p><\/blockquote><p>But\u00a0 nowhere in the record\u00a0 does it appear that said articles were actually presented or were received in evidence. The only evidence, therefore, which we have before us upon which to base a conviction of\u00a0 the defendants, is the declaration of the witness Ambol, to the effect that the defendants had been smoking opium\u00a0 in his sailboat and\u00a0 that he took from\u00a0 their\u00a0 possession\u00a0 certain apparatus and some opium ashes.\u00a0 This declaration of the witness Ambol is positively denied by each of the defendants.\u00a0 There is\u00a0 nothing in the record which,\u00a0 in any way, casts doubt upon\u00a0 the credibility of the testimony of the two defendants.\u00a0 We see no reason why their testimony in the\u00a0 present\u00a0 case should not\u00a0 be accepted,\u00a0 in view of all the facts contained\u00a0 in the record. On\u00a0 the contrary, the record does contain some indication that the witness Ambol was not clear concerning the facts stated in his declaration.\u00a0 He stated that he had been working for the\u00a0 defendants\u00a0 for forty-five days,\u00a0 leaving\u00a0 the impression that the trip on which he had possessed himself of the\u00a0 articles in question had lasted\u00a0 for forty-five days. The defendant, Chong Ting, states positively that the trip lasted but eleven days and ended upon the\u00a0 28th of April. The other\u00a0 defendant, Ha Kang, stated positively that he did not remember when the trip began, but he did remember that it ended upon the 28th of\u00a0 April.\u00a0 This apparent conflict between the testimony of the witness Ambol and that of the\u00a0 two defendants, taken into\u00a0 consideration with the fact that the witness Ambol had had in his possession said articles for\u00a0 a period of two days after\u00a0 he\u00a0 had separated from the defendants before delivering the same to any authority, in our judgment casts some doubt upon the truthfulness of\u00a0 the statements of the witness Ambol.\u00a0\u00a0 It further appears from the record that some nine or ten days had elapsed between the time the defendants and the witness Ambol\u00a0 separated before\u00a0 any complaint was presented in the courts.\u00a0 There is nothing in the record which\u00a0 conclusively shows, in our opinion, that the defendants are guilty of the crime charged in the complaint.<\/p><p>There is an objection to the form of the sentence dictated by the\u00a0 lower court which we deem inadvisable to overlook without criticism.\u00a0 It will be noted by reading the sentence above quoted that the same is in the alternative.\u00a0\u00a0 Sentences should\u00a0 not be in the alternative.\u00a0 There\u00a0 is nothing in the law which permits courts to impose sentences in the alternative.\u00a0 The sentence should not only show the facts upon which the defendant is found guilty, but it should\u00a0 clearly indicate the particular crime of which he is found guilty, as well as definitely and positively and without doubt to indicate the\u00a0 penalty imposed.\u00a0\u00a0 (<em>Articulo 51, Ley\u00a0 provisional para la aplicacion\u00a0 de las disposiciones del Codigo Penal,<\/em>) Of course\u00a0 where the defendant appeals, it is believed that the Supreme Court has a right to impose the penalty provided by law, for whatever offense, within the complaint. which the\u00a0 evidence shows was committed.\u00a0 In\u00a0 case the defendant does not appeal, however, it is difficult to imagine how a sentence in the alternative\u00a0 may be enforced.\u00a0\u00a0 It is true that under many of the provisions of the penal law, the court has the discretion\u00a0 or alternative of imposing one or another\u00a0 of\u00a0 different penalties; but certainly it can not be argued that because the\u00a0 judge has the discretion\u00a0 of\u00a0 fixing one\u00a0 or another penalty,\u00a0 that\u00a0 he can impose both\u00a0 in the alternative.\u00a0 He must\u00a0 fix positively and with certainty the particular penalty.<\/p><p>After\u00a0 a\u00a0 careful\u00a0 examination\u00a0 of the\u00a0 evidence adduced during the trial of the cause, we are persuaded that the same is\u00a0 not sufficiently positive\u00a0 to lead us\u00a0 to believe that the defendants are guilty of the\u00a0 crime charged in the complaint, beyond a\u00a0 reasonable doubt.\u00a0\u00a0 The sentence\u00a0 of the lower court is, therefore,\u00a0 hereby\u00a0 reversed, and it is hereby ordered that the complaint presented against the defendants be dismissed and that they be discharged from the custody of the law, with costs\u00a0 <em>de oficio<\/em>.<\/p><p><em> Arellano, C.

The engineer  of the thirteenth district of the Bureau of Public Works opposed the application with respect to the parcels A, B, and C, alleging that there should be segregated from the first two a strip of land 2.70 meters wide on the side thereof  which borders  the provincial  highway known as \"Pasig-Montalban,\" also called <em>Calzada de Mabini<\/em>, and from the third, a strip 3.30 meters wide along the northeast side of the same adjoining the highway leading to Montalban, which is an extension or continuation of the road just aforementioned.<\/p>\n<p>After hearing the case, the Court of Land Registration overruled the opposition to the application and ordered the inscription of the five parcels of land in the name of the applicant.<\/p>\n<p>It is  shown by the evidence that the highway adjoining the Parcels A and B now measures  7 meters and 30 centimeters in width; and that which borders Parcel C, 6 meters and 70  centimeters.  The opponent maintains that each of these highways  should, in  accordance with law, have a width of 12.90 meters,  and that strips of land of a width equal to the difference  between  said 12.90  meters and the width of said highways at the present time, should be taken from the parcels which adjoin the said highways.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment declares the following facts to have been proved:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"1. That the boundaries of  the said  three parcels  adjoining the highway, have never been altered or changed and that the royal order of May 21,1868  (cited as a ground by the opponent), which served as a basis for the instructions issued by the Bureau of Public Works providing that the said highway should have a width  of 12 meters and 90 centimeters,  was never complied with.<\/p>\n<p>\"2. That the highway in question has not until now been sought to be widened to a width of 12 meters and 30 centimeters, by taking from the adjoining properties the land necessary.<\/p>\n<p>\"3. That the applicant acquired the  properties described in the application, by  inheritance from the deceased Carmen Amado who was in possession of  the same, as owner, for more than thirty  years, including the time  the land was in  the possession of her predecessor in interest,  her father, Valeriano Amado.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>These conclusions. of fact are not  controverted in  the opponent's brief, and  in reality agree with the evidence adduced at the trial: wherefore, they should be maintained. It is clearly to be deduced from them that the strips of land, the subject of the adverse party's claim, never formed  a part of either the Mabini or the Montalban highway.  The royal order  cited by the opponent,  which prescribes  the width of highways, was never complied with  as  regards the two  roads just named, neither did the latter ever have an actual width of 12.90 meters which now, and only now, the opponent claims they have.  Such being  the case,  the allegations completely fail that are solely and  exclusively founded  on the fact, not only  unproven but also conclusively contradicted by the evidence, that the strips of land in question constitute a  part of the aforesaid highways and were aggregated to or incorporated with the applicant's property to the prejudice and detriment of  these roads.<\/p>\n<p>For the same reason, the opponent's allegation also completely fails, to wit, that the applicant's possession of more than thirty years can not serve her  as a title for the  acquisition of ownership  of the strips of land in 'question, because the same are parts of public roads or highways.  It has already hereinabove been shown  that this alleged fact is in  no wise true, since these  strips of land never were any part of such roads.<\/p>\n<p>That  these  strips of  land  are necessary  to give  to the highways above named the width required by  existing provisions of law, is not a  reason which can lawfully prevent the inscription sought by the applicant,  it being, as has been shown, that she and  her predecessors in interest have been in quiet, peaceable and  uninterrupted possession, as owners, of the lands that are the subject of the application. The opponent could bring the proper  action for  expropriation, in conformity with the provisions of sections 241 to 253 of the Code of Civil Procedure; but it is not lawful, in the meanwhile, to deprive the applicant, for that sole reason, of the ownership  of the lands in question and of the rights inherent  thereto.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"No one shall  be deprived of his property,  except  by competent authority and with sufficient cause of public utility,<em> always after the proper indemnity.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\"If this requisite has not been fulfilled the judges shall protect, and in a proper case replace the condemned party in possession.\"   (Art. 349, Civil Code.)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the opponent.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

CATALINA PITARGUE ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.\n  <br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\"><p>Appeals raised through bills of exception by counsel for both parties from judgment in this case by the Honorable Vicente Jocson, judge.<\/p>\n<p>On June 16, 1909, counsel for Alexandra Irlanda filed a complaint, representing that: (1)  The plaintiff and defendants are all of  legal age  and residents of Nagcarlang, Laguna;  (2)  Anselmo Irlanda died on November 30, 1887, according to the burial certificate marked \"A,\" leaving only two sons, his immediate heirs, named  Fe1ix and  Vicente Irlanda;  (3)  up  to the time of his death Anselmo Irlanda owned four tracts of coconut land, the first planted with 23, the second with 84 and the third with 371 young trees and the fourth with  31 mature trees, all bearing fruit, which tracts are situate  in the barrio of Banilad, pueblo of Nagcarlang, their boundaries being set forth in the complaint; (4) upon the death of the said Anselmo Irlanda his son  Vicente Irlanda took possession of said tracts, because his  brother Felix was then in Camarines engaged in business;  (5) on January 4,  1902, said Felix Irlanda died in the pueblo of Calabanga, Ambos Camarines, according to the burial certificate marked \"B,\"  leaving a  daughter,  the plaintiff, who was  born  of his marriage with Roberta Rubin, according to the certificates marked \"C\" and \"D;\" that on or about the month of  June of the same year, 1902, Vicente Irlanda also died in Nagcarlang, leaving a widow, Catalina Pitargue, and daughters Agustina, Isabel, Sergia, and Flaviana Irlanda, who  took possession of the  four tracts  of  land before mentioned and since then have been reaping the crops and profits therefrom; that in  spite of the  demands made at various times by the plaintiff that, the defendants deliver to her half of the said tracts the defendants have nevertheless refused to do so, thereby  having inflicted upon the plaintiff damages estimated at P600 a year by retaining said lands and enjoying the fruits thereof; whereas according to section 174, paragraphs 2 and 4, of the Code of Civil Procedure, the most efficacious and adequate means for the preservation and administration of this property during the litigation is the appointment of a receiver, because the plaintiff is directly interested in half of all the funds derived from the sale of the products of said tracts, especially as the defendants have no other property to answer for the damages they have been inflicting upon the plaintiff and yet have been for a long time using said tracts and the products  thereof.   In conclusion, judgment was prayed, declaring: (a) That the plaintiff is the absolute owner by inheritance from her deceased grandfather, Anselmo Irlanda, and her father, the latter's son, Felix Irlanda, of half of  the four tracts of land mentioned in the complaint; (b) that the defendants be ordered to deliver to the plaintiff said half of the lands in question and to execute the corresponding instruments of partition; (c) that the defendants be sentenced to pay to the plaintiff the sum of P600 a year as damages from the month of June, 1902, until execution of judgment in this case; (d) that a receiver be appointed to take over the administration of the profits in money derived from the lands in question during the litigation, said appointment to  be made in favor of Telesforo  Bueno, under bond  of P1,500,  the approximate value of said four tracts of  land;  and  further that the defendants be sentenced to pay the costs in the case.<\/p>\n<p>Counsel for the defendants in amended  answer generally and specifically denied all the allegations contained in the foregoing complaint; and in special  defense alleged: That Anselmo Irlanda had two sons, Felix and Vicente Irlanda; that the defendant Catalina Pitargue in her marriage with Vicente Irlanda had four daughters named Agustina, Isabel, Sergia, and Flaviana, who married Justo Sotomango, one of the defendants, as Flaviana Irlanda is dead; that Felix Irlanda had a daughter, who is the plaintiff;  that the property described in the third paragraph of the complaint belonged with other real estate to the deceased Anselmo Irlanda, who in his lifetime made a partition of all his property between his two heirs, Felix and Vicente Irlanda, which partition is now asked by the plaintiff; that  more than a half of all the property of the said Anselmo Irlanda was awarded in the partition made over forty years ago to Felix Irlanda, father of the plaintiff, and since that time Vicente Irlanda has possessed with title of owner  and to the exclusion of any other right the property described in the third paragraph of the complaint, by virtue of the assignment his father Anselmo made to him as the portion pertaining to him in said partition, that Felix Irlanda in like manner took possession of the property which was assigned him in that partition made by his father and in the exercise of the title he had to said property conveyed it by absolute sale to Manuel  Lucido who in turn sold it to other persons, the present owner being the Chinaman Kiam; wherefore the plaintiff Alexandra irlanda has no longer any right to the property claimed as it is the exclusive property of the defendants; and in their name it was prayed  that they be absolved from the complaint and declared to be  owners of  the lands described in the third paragraph  of the complaint, with the  costs against the plaintiff.<\/p>\n<p>After trial and submission of evidence,  counsel for the plaintiff and the  defendants agreed to accept as true the facts alleged in the first five paragraphs of the complaint. Later, counsel for the defendants  asked  for annulment of this agreement, but such motion  was objected to by counsel for the plaintiff and was overruled by the court on July 19, 1910.  From the evidence the court decided the  case  on October 26 of the same year by declaring that the property in question had belonged to Anselmo Irlanda, who, at his death, left two sons named  Felix and Vicente, both now dead; that Felix Irlanda  left as his sole  heir Alexandra Irlanda, and Vicente Irlanda the said Agustina  or  Justina, Isabel, and Sergia Irlanda and the deceased Flaviana; and that the property in litigation had never been  partitioned among the heirs.   It was therefore ordered that the property in litigation be divided into two  equal parts, one for Alexandra Irlanda and the other for the children of Vicente Irlanda.  Catalina Pitargue was  sentenced  to  restore to the heirs a sum at the rate of P72 a year, as the value of the products of said lands up to the time when the same were delivered,  counting from July  1, 1902, to be divided into two parts in the same way as the lands.  The defendants were sentenced to pay the costs in equal proportions. Counsel for the defendants excepted to this judgment and asked for a new trial, which  motion was  overruled  on November 25, 1910, with exception on the part of said defendants.  Counsel for the plaintiff  also excepted to the portion relating to the  amount of damages granted her, and further prayed that such portion of the decision be annulled and  a new trial ordered, which motion was overruled on December 22, with exception on the part of the plaintiff. The  corresponding bills of exception were presented and by agreement of both parties merged into one, which after approval was forwarded to this court.<\/p>\n<p>The action in this case has for its subject the partition of certain hereditary property, after declaration of heirship, and the delivery of a half thereof with its products to the complainant  as the legitimate  successor  of its original owner, now deceased.<\/p>\n<p>In the judgment appealed from the following appears:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"From  the evidence adduced  it is plain that the lands in question belonged to Anselmo Irlanda and passed into the possession of Vicente Irlanda and of his  wife and children at  his  death,  while Felix  Irlanda, who died in Camarines, was absent; and that this property has not yet been partitioned among the heirs;<\/p>\n<p>\"That in his lifetime Anselmo Irlanda sold some parcels, especially when he was  a prisoner, has no weight, because he had a perfect right to do so, and even though Felix did the same with one parcel when his father was a prisoner, it is not presumptuous to suppose that he did so at his father's command, which is evidenced  by his silence up to the time of his death.<\/p>\n<p>\"The final move of the defendants was to present Guillermo Fule, son-in-law of Catalina Pitargue, as intervener in the ownership of the property in question, an  intervention which  I think  to  have been  unfortunately  allowed, because the definite answers of the defendants and the categorical affirmation of Catalina Pitargue itself leave no room for doubt that the property belonged to Anselmo Irlanda, who had two sons, Vicente and Felix, and that the plaintiff as the only child of Felix is entitled to a half of the property\u2014questions and  statements which  can not in  any manner  be  denied at the  mere whim  of  the  defendants themselves.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>It is a fact admitted and agreed upon between the parties that the four tracts or  parcels of land described in the third paragraph of  the complaint  belonged to  Anselmo Irlanda,  the predecessor in  interest  and  father of the brothers Vicente and Felix, from  whose rights in the inheritance which  their common father,  Anselmo, left at death, arise those which the plaintiff and the  children of Vicente Irlanda's widow now assert.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The rights to the succession of a person are transmitted from the moment of his death.\"  (Art. 657,  Civil  Code.).<\/p>\n<p>\"Succession is granted either by the will  of the man as expressed in a will or, in its absence, by provision of law.\" (Art. 658, Civil Code.)<\/p>\n<p>\"Heirs succeed the deceased in all his rights and obligations by the mere fact  of his  death.\"  (Art. 661, Civil Code.)<\/p>\n<p>The supreme court of  Spain has  applied  this  latter article in a judgment on appeal of November 23,  1903, thus:<\/p>\n<p>\"As has been repeatedly decided by this  supreme  court, the heir, as the successor of the deceased in all his rights and  obligations, has  a right  of  action and  personality to demand what pertains to his interest, without the cooperation of his coheirs,  whenever it is not to their prejudice and provided that he conform to the laws regulating common ownership of property.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>In another judgment of December 11, of the said year 1903 it says:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"It is an ancient rule of our law, confirmed by article 661 of the Civil Code, that the heirs succeed by the mere fact of the death of their predecessor in interest.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Many other decisions  of that supreme court might be cited with reference to the hereditary succession  and the rights of the heirs of a deceased person.<\/p>\n<p>In the decision in the case of Pascual <em>vs.<\/em> Angeles (4 Phil. Rep., 604), this court  declared that the heir continues in law the personality of his predecessor in interest, who transmits to him such of his rights, actions and obligations as are not extinguished by his death.<\/p>\n<p>Admitting the legal provisions cited and the precedents established by the courts in the construction and proper application thereof, it is unquestionable that the plaintiff is entitled to be recognized as the legitimate successor of her father, Felix  Irlanda,  and therefore of her  grandfather, Anselmo Irlanda, by right of representation in the property which the latter left at his death; and that after  division into halves the part which belongs to her should be delivered to her with the products it is yielding and has yielded. The status of the plaintiff, Alexandra Irlanda, as legitimate daughter of Felix Irlanda and granddaughter of his father, Anselmo Irlanda,  being acknowledged by counsel  for the defendants, and the fact that the property left by the grand-father at his death is still pro indiviso, without either Felix or the granddaughter having received half of said property, being duly shown by the record,  it is neither  lawful nor just that the  family of the other  son of Anselmo should retain and enjoy such half thereof  to  the \"exclusion and prejudice of the plaintiff.<\/p>\n<p>Under article 807 of the Civil Code, the legitimate children and  descendants, with  regard  to their legitimate  parents and  ascendants, are heirs by force of law.  The plaintiff as the daughter of Felix Irlanda is the granddaughter and legitimate descendant in direct line of Anselmo Irlanda, owner of the said property.<\/p>\n<p>According to article 925, the right of representation shall always take place in  the direct descending line, but never in the ascending; and shall only be recognized in the collateral line in favor of the children of brothers or sisters, whether they be of whole or half blood.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The  children of the deceased shall always inherit from him  in their own right, dividing the inheritance in equal shares.\"   (Art. 932, Civil  Code.)<\/p>\n<p>\"The  grandchildren and other descendants shall inherit by right of representation.''   (Art. 933, Civil Code.)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The plaintiff's status as granddaughter of Anselmo Irlanda since she is the daughter of his son, Felix Irlanda, being admitted and acknowledged, her personality to claim half  of the property her said grandfather left at his death can not  be denied, by  virtue of her right of representation by force of law, which same she acquired from the moment of the death of her father,  Felix Irlanda, nor can her right be denied  to receive and hold half of said property,  and it is unjust that her coheirs, the children of her late  uncle, Vicente Irlanda, should be permitted to continue to retain it without  any right.<\/p>\n<p>A  half of the property  left by her grandfather  at his death can  not  be withheld  from the plaintiff, because her father did  not receive it in his lifetime, and as said property is still undivided she has an unquestionable right to demand the partition thereof  as heiress in an intestate estate by right of representation of her  said  grandfather,   (Secs. 181, 182 and 183, Code  of Civil Procedure.)<\/p>\n<p>It is asserted in one of the errors assigned to the judgment appealed from that the court incurred it by not declaring that  the property of the deceased Anselmo Irlanda had already been partitioned by him in his lifetime among his heirs  and by not sustaining the prescription alleged by the defendants.<\/p>\n<p>Said partition does not seem from the record to be duly proved, but on the contrary, it appears that the property of the deceased grandfather of the parties  still  remains pro indivteo, for on various occasions the widow in second marriage with the deceased Felix Irlanda, father of the plaintiff, made demand upon the widow of the deceased Vicente Irlanda, mother of the defendants, for partition of the property she had in her possession,  derived from Anselmo  Irlanda as one of his heirs, while said defendant widow, Catalina  Pitargue, stated under  oath that she did not know whether the property of her deceased father-in-law  had ever been partitioned; and the witness  Lorenzo Irlanda on affirming that some forty years ago Anselmo Irlanda partitioned his  property between his two sons, Vicente and  Felix, added that he had  heard Anselmo say that he was  going to execute an instrument  of partition of said property between his two sons, but he did not know whether this had been done nor did he learn  afterwards whether an instrument recording such partition had ever been executed.<\/p>\n<p>Observing  that it is  neither usual  nor common in the ordinary course of things for a father  in his lifetime to partition his  property among his children, especially when he is not very rich and does not possess much, because it is customary to leave the partition until  after his death, and even admitting as true that Angelmo Irlanda did partition his property, which was not extensive, between  his two sons, although it does not appear what he kept to live on, the delivery of the property partitioned\u2014on the supposition that it was delivered\u2014could only  have the character of a donation inter vivos, made,  according to the witness Lorenzo,  some forty years ago.  In such case, under law 9, title  4, partida 5, when its  value did not exceed 500 gold maravedis  it jdid not have to be recorded in a public instrument, but in case of excess  thereof  it had to  be  done by exhibition of the instrument for approval to the judge of the district.   The value  of the property donated  does not appear in the record, nor is there shown any fulfillment of the requisite of exhibition required by the law then in force, for the Civil Code only went into effect toward the close of the year 1889.   So  it is not proven that Anselmo Irlanda in his  lifetime partitioned his  property between his two sons, or that he made a donation of his property to his sons Felix and Vicente.<\/p>\n<p>The exception of prescription alleged against the action exercised in this case by the plaintiff is disposed of simply by reading over article 1965 of the Civil Code:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Among coheirs,  coowners, or proprietors  of adjacent estates, the action to  demand the  division of the inheritance, of the thing held in  common, or the survey of the adjacent properties does not prescribe.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>With reference to the error imputed to  the  court for having overruled the motion of the defendants to annul the agreement of facts entered into between the counsel for both parties, it must be noted that the stipulations in a case are agreements or admissions regarding certain facts included in the litigation and  are conclusive between the parties. Acts or facts admitted do not require proof and can not be contradicted, unless it be shown  that the admission was made through  a palpable mistake, for parties are not allowed to gainsay their own  acts or deny rights which they have previously recognized.   (Sec. 333, Code of Civil Procedure.)   Wherefore, and by  admitting the reasons assigned by the court in its order of July  19, 1910, the annulment asked by the defendants is held to have been properly overruled, as well as the  decision of July 26 of the same year with reference to the claim of intervention presented by Guillermo  Fule, for the reasons therein given,  especially when he did  not present his claim as intervener  in the manner prescribed by law.<\/p>\n<p>As to the obligation of delivering along  with half of the hereditary property the products derived by the possessors thereof, at least from June  16, 1909, the date of filing the complaint,  if the plaintiff is entitled to receive half of the property inherited from her  grandfather, it follows  that the fruits produced thereon unquestionably belong to her. (Art. 354,  Civil Code.)<\/p>\n<p>Article 1063 of the same  code prescribes:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"On making the  division, the coheirs shall reciprocally compensate each other  for the income and fruits each of them may have received from the hereditary property for the useful and necessary expenses made on said property or for the damage caused thereto by malice or negligence.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The plaintiff  has  never entered into possession  of  said half of the property which belongs to her from the hereditary estate of  her  grandfather in  representation of her father, and therefore her right can not be denied to receive the fruits derived by the widow and children of her uncle, Vicente Irlanda, at least from the date when she judicially demanded the delivery of both, for under section 191 of the Code of Civil  Procedure in an action fof  partition  one tenant in common, or joint tenant, or coparcener may recover from another  his just share of rents and profits of the common  undivided  property, and the final judgment shall  include an allowance for  such rents and profits as are found to be justly recoverable.<\/p>\n<p>After observing that  since the death of Vicente Irlanda in June, 1902, his widow and children have been enjoying the fruits or products of said four parcels of land which Anselmo Irlanda left at his death, as well as bearing the expenses of gathering and  the  loss from poor  crops  and calamities that have  diminished the product of the coconut trees  growing on said lands, the court held that with the number or quantity of nuts gathered each year the proceeds could be fixed according to the evidence at an average value of ?150 a year, which sum should be divided into two equal parts and the widow and heirs of Vicente Irlanda obligated to pay to the plaintiff P75 a year from June 16, 1909, to the date of payment, as the vaiue of half of the product of said lands.<\/p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, whereby the errors assigned on appeal are refuted, we believe that the judgment should be, and it is, affirmed, except the portion sentencing Catalina Pitargue to pay  the sum of ?72 a year as the value of the product of the lands in question, to be divided into  two parts,  which  portion is reversed, and in  lieu thereof  she and the heirs of Vicente Irlanda are sentenced to pay to the plaintiff the sum  of 75  a year from June 16, 1909, as half of the  value of the product of half  of the. lands in litigation, which belongs to the plaintiff; with costs against the defendants.   So ordered.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Mapa, Johnson, Carson,<\/em> and <em>Trent, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<\/p>\n<\/div>",

But on appeal to this court the trial court's action in overruling the demurrer was the ground for the first assignment of error.<\/p>\n<p>One of the grounds for the  demurrer was the fact that there existed another suit between the same parties, the plaintiff herein being petitioner and the defendants, with many others, opponents in the Court of Land Registration with reference to the same land that is the subject of the complaint.<\/p>\n<p>The trial court merely assigned as ground for overruling the demurrer that it did not consider sufficient the reasons upon which the same was based.<\/p>\n<p>But the appellants in this instance, in arguing this first assignment of error, say:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"It is true that that fact that the first ground of demurrer was the pendency of another action does not appear from the complaint and therefore cannot be alleged in a demurrer as an objection to the sufficiency thereof; but it is also true that the lower court knew of the existence of this fact, for it was in that very court that the case of inscription was being heard, even though by proxy, and in that  very court that the action  for recovery which  is the  subject matter of the present  proceedings was on trial.\"   (Sixth allegation.)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The court's reasons for overruling the demurrer, based on the pendency of another action, are found in section 91 of the Code of Civil Procedure, according to which the facts in the complaint to which the  demurrer is interposed are admitted  and, as is pointed  out by the appellants in the above quotation from their brief, the complaint states no fact or even makes  any allusion to the existence  of another suit in the Court of Land Registration.<\/p>\n<p>This admitted, the first assignment of error cannot be considered, and the demurrer was properly overruled.<\/p>\n<p>Yet  the  appellants say that the pendency  of  the  same litigation over the  same subject was a fact that could be understood to be alleged in the complaint,  because of the perfect knowledge the plaintiff had and the court also had better  than anybody else, for it was then trying the  other case in representation of that other court.   But the law does not permit this interpretation, as this court said in another case:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The demurrer to a complaint can have no object  other than to raise questions of law upon the facts alleged in the complaint.\"  (Liquete vs. Dario, 5 Phil. Rep., 221, 224.)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>And it is improper to proceed by means of presumptions, when the law affords other means to the same  end.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"When any of the matters enumerated in section ninety-one do not appear upon the face of the complaint, the objection can only be  taken  by answer.\"   (Code of  Civil Procedure,  92.)'<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>This is  what  the defendants appear not to have  done. In their answer they do not set up as a defense the pendency of another action entered as  a ground for demurrer.<\/p>\n<p>The  court, however, seeing that it  is a  precept of the Code of Civil Procedure  that \"the provisions  of this  code, and the proceedings under it, shall be liberally construed, in order to promote its object and assist the parties in obtaining speedy justice\" (sec. 2); and seeing moreover that it is of vital  concern to the stability of the law that  what the res adjudicata covers be declared in a single judgment so that it may produce its far-reaching effects, it is  meet that for the sake of justice the case be restored to the status  of answer to the  complaint  and not shut the  door upon the parties or fail to bring out before the  court the true nature of the action instituted, so that the question of Us pendem involved in  the defense and  already raised, which is of capital importance in the case, may be decided.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment appealed from is therefore set aside.

This property was occupied by Leopoldo Sichon as <em>pro indiviso<\/em> owner of one-half  of the same and lessee of the other half which belonged  to Alejandro  Montelibano.  It was further stated  in tbe application that, in  the improbable  event that the  property could not be registered under  the Land Registration  Act, they would then rely upon the benefits accorded by chapter 6  of Act No.  926, inasmuch as the said Montelibano and Sichon were then  and had been in possession of  the  land and had  cultivated it for more than twenty years.<\/p>\n<p>Notification having been made by means of notices published in accordance with the law, the Attorney-General, in behalf  of the Director of Lands, opposed the registration sought and prayed that the application be denied, and that, should  the  said property be  found  to belong to the Insular Government, it be  adjudicated thereto  and the proper certificate of registration issued in the latter's behalf.<\/p>\n<p>During the course of the proceedings, counsel for Enrica, Juana,  Rufino, Juana,  and Gabino, all  surnamed  Sison y Tubungbanua, opposed  the said registration,  for the reason that the application included  a parcel of land belonging to them, although afterwards this opposition was withdrawn.<\/p>\n<p>After evidence had  been  adduced in  the  proceedings relative to the facts alleged and to the order of September 8, 1909, allowing a rehearing, the said associate judge of the Court of Land Registration, on August  30, 1910, rendered judgment  whereby, among other  provisions,  after entry of general default, the adjudication and  registration of the said two parcels  of land were decreed in the names of Alejandro  Montelibano and Leopoldo Sichon.   Exception was taken to this judgment by counsel for the Director of Lands who, by written motion, asked for a rehearing.

The facts\u00a0 necessary t disposition of the\u00a0 case are as follows:\u00a0 The defendants in a\u00a0 certain case desired to procure an appeal bond in order to stay execution of the judgment rendered against them pending an appeal to this court.\u00a0 For this purpose one Yuen\u00a0 Chi Hin\u00a0 approached Rivera for assistance.\u00a0\u00a0 Rivera to this Chinaman to Palma and it was agreed between the three that a bond in the amount desired, P5,600, would be furnished for 5 per cent of its value.\u00a0\u00a0 Rivera and\u00a0 Palma had possession of tax receipts amounting to nearly\u00a0 P30,000, covering property located at San Miguel de Mayumo, Province of Bulacan, and belonging to one Anastacia Dasig.\u00a0 They persuaded the defendant Maria Carmen Catu to appear before the court with these papers, declare herself to be Anastacia\u00a0 Dasig, and sign the appeal bond such person.\u00a0 This plan was carried out, the bond was accepted by the court, and the Chinaman delivered to the appellants Palma and Rivera a check payable\u00a0 to\u00a0 bearer for the sum of P3,000.\u00a0 These appellants took the check to the\u00a0 bank the same day\u00a0 the bond was executed and cashed it, it bearing the indorsement of the defendant Palma.\u00a0 The civil case w duly elevated to this Supreme Court, where the decision of the lower court was affirmed and\u00a0 plaintiffs\u00a0 awarded judgment in the\u00a0 sum of P5,000 wit costs in\u00a0 both instances.\u00a0\u00a0 The cause being remanded for execution, the sheriff, was unable to find the defendants\u00a0 in that civil case or any pr of theirs upon which he could levy, and the\u00a0 plaintiffs\u00a0 thereupon moved against the\u00a0 sureties on the appeal bond.\u00a0 Process was first issued agai Lim Suaco, the\u00a0 other\u00a0 surety on the\u00a0 bond, but\u00a0 was\u00a0 returned\u00a0 unsatisfied with the statement\u00a0 by the sheriff that this party declared\u00a0 himself unable meet the judgment.\u00a0 Several days later Anastacia Dasig presented a motion to the court in which she denied that she\u00a0 had signed the bond and requested that it be annulled as to\u00a0 her.\u00a0 This motion was denied, but subsequently thereto this person in a separate civil action succeeded in the bond annulled as to her.\u00a0\u00a0 The plaintiffs in the civil case were the remediless,\u00a0 and\u00a0 unable to recover\u00a0 their judgment.\u00a0 Upon Anastacia Das appearance\u00a0 in court with a denial of having signed the bond, criminal proceedings were promptly instituted against .the defendants in the case bar\u00a0 upon a charge of falsification of a public document, and they were convicted of the\u00a0 crime\u00a0 charged and\u00a0 sentenced\u00a0 to various terms\u00a0 of imprisonment.\u00a0\u00a0 Subsequently thereto, a new trial was granted and shortly thereafter the prosecuting attorney presented a\u00a0 new or amended complain in which the\u00a0 same defendants were\u00a0 charged\u00a0 with\u00a0 the crime of <em>estafa <\/em> This new complaint was based upon the same facts as the\u00a0 former one for falsification of a\u00a0 public document.\u00a0 On the same day that the new complaint charging the defendants with the\u00a0 crime of <em>estafa<\/em> was f the following order was entered:<\/p><blockquote><p>'I hereby certify that the accused Marcelino Rivera, Quirico T.

Tho the defendant does not offer so much as a scintilla of evidence in his o defense, it is\u00a0 incumbent upon the Government to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. But the presumption of innocence with which the prison favored\u00a0 may be overcome by convincing evidence of his guilt, and. when such evidence has been\u00a0 presented\u00a0 by the prosecution, his continued silence no bar to\u00a0 its consideration.\u00a0\u00a0 It is then incumbent upon the defendant would maintain his innocence to bring forth the\u00a0 proofs which will demolish the case made by the Government.\u00a0\u00a0 To indulge, under such circumstances, conjecture\u00a0 and vague probabilities will not supply the absence of mater evidence clearly within his power to\u00a0 produce.\u00a0 In the case\u00a0 at bar it w certainly the\u00a0 duty of the prosecution\u00a0 to prove the ultimate fact that plaintiffs in the civil case\u00a0 were still holding their unsatisfied judgment time of the trial of the defendants in this criminal case.\u00a0\u00a0 It would ha eminently\u00a0 proper\u00a0 for the Government to\u00a0 have introduced direct testimony in support of this fact.\u00a0\u00a0 But in this case, the collateral proof of the appears to us\u00a0 just as satisfactory and conclusive as positive testimony be.\u00a0 The appellants did not attempt\u00a0 to\u00a0 controvert\u00a0 this damaging: evidence, which, had it been possible, they could very easily have done. are clearly of opinion that the prosecution has established this fact be any question of a doubt.<\/p><p>It is further urged that the pecuniary loss suffered by the\u00a0 plaintiff b not been ascertained.\u00a0 Exhibit F, which is\u00a0 the order of execution issue against the surety Lim Suaco, shows the amount due from the bondsmen to be P5,133.39.\u00a0 In this amount is included a certain number of small item costs which the bank could not have received, but the net amount due the bank and which it lost by reason of the presentation of the bogus bond amounts to P5,088.56.<\/p><p>According to the settled doctrine of this court, the essential\u00a0 elements the\u00a0 crime of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">estafa <\/span>are\u00a0 (1) the\u00a0 deceit employed to defraud another, a (2)\u00a0 the injury or damage caused\u00a0 thereby.\u00a0 Both elements must be\u00a0 prese in order to sustain a conviction for such crime.\u00a0 (United States <em>vs.<\/em> 5\u00a0 Phil.

Macario left five children, among them Tomas Cedeno;\u00a0 Domingo, same\u00a0 number,\u00a0 among\u00a0 them a daughter named Sofia, who died leaving a son,\u00a0 Manuel Sarita; and Leon, four, among them, Gregorio Cedeno.\u00a0\u00a0 All o these except Gregorio Cedeno and his brothers sue for the ownership of the land and the other personal property\u00a0 of Andres Candia which, together with the fruits thereof, they requested the Court of First Instance of Cebu to sentence the latter to return to them and, further, that he indemnify the the amount of P800, and\u00a0 pay the costs.<p>Andres Candia, a nephew of Roberta Montesa as the son of her sister, testified that he had been brought up, from the time he was very young, i the house\u00a0 of the spouses Cedeno and Montesa; that he\u00a0 worked on the house which those spouses left at their death when\u00a0 it was under construction and, from his boyhood, assisted in the cultivation of the land;\u00a0 that sai Apolonio Cedefio, otherwise known as Isidario\u00a0 Cedeno, was a cabeza de barangay of the\u00a0 pueblo\u00a0 of Sibonga, who, in order\u00a0 to\u00a0 pay\u00a0 certain shortages of the <em>cabeceria<\/em> under his charge, on the 24th of June, sold the said land to Juan Basa Villarrosa, who held it in quiet and peac possession for twenty-four years and at his death such possession was continued by his sons, Sinforoso and Vicente Villarrosa, from whom witnes Andres Candia, acquired the property by purchase; that at no time did he hold the same as a lessee nor pay\u00a0 for it any emphyteutic rent whatever; and that he never had in his possession the animals mentioned in the complaint.<\/p><p>The court absolved the defendant from the complaint, on the grounds that, with regard to the animals and real property sued for, there was no proof whatever that they were in the possession of the spouses at the time of t death, and, with respect to\u00a0 the land:\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 That the defendant was the possessor in good faith continuously and was presumed to hold under just so long as the contrary should not be proved; and (2) that neither the plaintiffs nor their alleged predecessors in interest made demand for it the period of twenty-six years, since the ownership thereof was conveyed Isidario or Apolinario Cedeno to Juan\u00a0 Basa Villarrosa,\u00a0 on the 24th of J 1881, it being evident that during this very long period\u00a0 of time\u00a0 they d obtain possession of the property.<\/p><p>The judgment having been appealed through a bill of exceptions and the appeal having been heard, we determine: With respect to the\u00a0 personal property, that the opinion of the trial court is unchangeable, as, in thi it has not been impugned as erroneous on appeal, and is certainly in acco with the merits of the case; and, as\u00a0 concerns the land, (1) that\u00a0 this a one for the recovery of possession from the present possessor, and, in or to bring it, the plaintiffs make use of hereditary right, by styling them heirs of Apolinario Cedeno; (2) that the plaintiffs are, on the one side; Cedeno, who is a sister of the deceased Apolinario\u00a0 Cedeno, on another, some nephews and nieces of the latter, his brother Macario's children; an the other, some children of Domingo Cedeno, among them, Manuel Sarita, th principal plaintiff, in representation of his deceased mother, Sofia, als daughter of Domingo Cedeno;\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 that they assert\u00a0 their hereditary right an intestate succession, and that the land in question was the community property of the deceased\u00a0 spouses, Cedeno\u00a0 and Montesa,\u00a0 as\u00a0 established hypothetically, especially by\u00a0 the plaintiffs' witnesses, Estanislao Sola Irineo Tormis; (4) that, such being the case, they could demand, as the legitimate heirs of Apolinario\u00a0 Cedeno, only one-half of the land, but no other half which belonged to Roberta Montesa, of whom they are not heirs ab intestato, from the\u00a0 fact that they are collateral relatives of this w husband: so that the claim to all the land is manifestly unfounded; (5) t moreover, it is manifestly unfounded in so much as Sofia's son, Manuel\u00a0 S in representation of\u00a0 his mother, could not act as a plaintiff, nor could Sofia, do so by representing her father, Domingo; on\u00a0 the hypothesis that right\u00a0 of representation in the collateral line\u00a0 can only take place in f the children of brothers or sisters (Civil Code, art. 925, par. 2), and t Manuel Sarita is not a child of a brother, as are the children of Macario Domingo\u00a0 Cedeno; and;\u00a0 finally, that it was\u00a0 manifestly imprudent also to include as plaintiffs Gregorio, Lorenzo, Abundio\u00a0 and Jose, the children Cedeno, a brother of the deceased Apolinario\u00a0 Cedeno, when, as the first them\u00a0 testified,\u00a0 they\u00a0 did\u00a0 not attempt\u00a0 to take part in this litigation\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"Judge. Is\u00a0 Mr. Sevilla your attorney?\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"Witness.\u00a0 No, sir.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"Q. Have you employed him? - A. No.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"Q. Have you spoken to him about this case? - A.

The<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 have\u00a0 not.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"Q. So that in this suit neither you nor your brothers now have any claim<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 against Andres Candia? - A. No.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Elsewhere this same witness said:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"My uncles and cousins spoke to me about the institution of this suit; I them that it could not be, because the land was purchased by Juan Villarrosa at the time that our deceased\u00a0 uncle\u00a0 found himself\u00a0 obliged cover certain shortages against him in\u00a0 the cabeceria; it was then that sold the land.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>In view of the foregoing considerations, we decide, with respect to the exercise of the hereditary right derived from the\u00a0 intestate succession Apolinario Cedeno:<\/p><p>First. That Manuel Sarita, the principal plaintiff, in whose house, accused Exhibit D, there was drawn up at his request the engagement of all the plaintiffs to\u00a0 confide the suit to the attorney who has conducted it, h absolutely no such right, because\u00a0 he cannot represent his grandfather Domingo, since, as aforesaid, in the collateral line the right of represent can only take\u00a0 place\u00a0 in favor\u00a0 of\u00a0 the children of brothers or\u00a0 sister not in favor of the grandson of a brother, such as is\u00a0 the said Manuel Sarita, the son of Sofia Cedeno who,\u00a0 in turn, was the daughter of Domingo Cedeno.<\/p><p>Second.\u00a0 That, on\u00a0 the\u00a0 hypothesis that such\u00a0 hereditary right derived the intestate succession of\u00a0 Apolinario Cedeno, does exist,\u00a0 it could o exercised by Cristeta Cedeno, the children of Macario Gedeno, and those Domingo Cedeno, but not by\u00a0 Manuel Sarita, because in inheritances the nearer relative excludes the more\u00a0 remote, excepting the right of representation in proper cases (Civil Code, art. 921); from which it is that, in pushing forward Cristeta Cedeno, the children of Macario Cedef and those of Domingo Cedeno, to exercise such a hereditary right, it sh have been noticed that the personality of these parties as the nearest relatives excluded that of Manuel Sarita, the son of Sofia Cedeno, of a more remote degree.<\/p><p>Third. That, on the same hypothesis, in the eyes of the law no meaning whatever could be given to the document, Exhibit H of the plaintiffs, wherein it is made to appear that the widow of Apolinario Cedefio, Roberta Montesa, implored of the heirs of her deceased husband that she be allowed\u00a0 to continue in\u00a0 the possession of the land and the house of the family; inasmuch as, as co-owner of such property, she was entitled one-half of it and, besides, had a right of usufruct to one-half of the other half of the same, pursuant to the provisions of articles 837\u00a0 and of the Civil Code, and until she was satisfied for her part of usufruction half of the\u00a0 other half remained liable for the payment of such part of usufruct.\u00a0 (Civil Code, art. 838.)<\/p><p>Fourth. The hypothesis disappears from the moment that it is proved that at the death of such alleged predecessor in interest\u00a0 in the\u00a0 inheritance land\u00a0 in\u00a0 question\u00a0 was not owned by him, it having been transferred in 1881, according to\u00a0 a conclusion established by the trial\u00a0 judge.\u00a0\u00a0 The the action for the recovery of possession, derived from such alleged inheritance, cannot exist.<\/p><p>This transfer of the\u00a0 land\u00a0 affected by Isidario or Apolinario Cedeno w originally the title alleged by the defendant\u00a0 a title which must not presumed in the present case, but proved.\u00a0 It is true that the\u00a0 possess the capacity of owner, has in his favor the legal presumption that he h under lawful title\u00a0 and cannot be\u00a0 compelled\u00a0 to exhibit it (Civil Code 446) ; but it is\u00a0 also true\u00a0 that when the defendant agrees with the plaintiffs that the thing demanded belonged to a determinate person during his lifetime from\u00a0 whom\u00a0 these latter claim to derive their right existence is thereby admitted of a right of ownership opposed\u00a0 to that the present possessor,\u00a0 and hence logically the necessity for the latte prove his title and exhibit it,\u00a0 in order to destroy the contrary presure in favor of that prior ownership.<\/p><p>The defendant, according to the finding of the trial judge, has proved he has such a title, by the exhibition\u00a0 of three, documents:\u00a0 one, of sale by\u00a0 Isidario or\u00a0 Apolinario Cedeno to Juan Basa Villarrosa\u00a0 (Exhib another, of the sale with <em>pacto de retro<\/em> by the latter's son, Si Villarrosa,\u00a0 to the defendant\u00a0 (Exhibit 3);\u00a0 and the other,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 of final sale by the other son, Vicente Villarrosa, to the same party, And Candia (Exhibit 4).<\/p><p>Against this finding of the lower court, the appellants allege: 1. That Cedeno, the vendor, has nothing to do\u00a0 with\u00a0 Apolinario\u00a0 Cedeno,\u00a0 his predecessor in interest; and, 2. That the land in Talamban known as tha Juan Basa Villarrosa is\u00a0 about 15\u00a0 or 20\u00a0 prazas distant from the land Talamban which is concerned in this litigation.<\/p><p>But the finding impugned is in no wise erroneous.\u00a0 Tomas Cedeno,\u00a0 one o the plaintiffs, testified that his uncle Apolinario had the baptismal o Christian name of Isidario, was better known by the nickname of Adiot, was the only cabeza de barangay in Sibonga with the surname of Cedeno. Domingo Cedeno, who was erroneously made to appear as a plaintiff, said that the original owner of the land in question was \"his deceased uncle Isidario Cedeno,\" and that\u00a0 Isidario was the true name.\u00a0 The averment of the appellants that \"the finding of the court is\u00a0 precisely contrary agreement made by both\u00a0 parties\" (brief, 8) is in all\u00a0 respects\u00a0 incorrect the said\u00a0 agreement, they say, no other name than that of Apolinario wa recorded and admitted to be the name of the plaintiffs, predecessor in interest.\u00a0 By that same agreement the defendant could not be heard to prove another so different name as that of Isidario for the purpose of confusing it with that of Apolinario\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\"\u00a0\u00a0 (brief, 8).\u00a0 The agr only says: \"By agreement between the attorneys for both parties, the complaint in this case is understood to be amended in the sense that th name of Apolonio Gedeno,\u00a0 which occurs in the first\u00a0 line of the first paragraph of the complaint, is substituted for the name of\u00a0 Apolinario Cedeno; it being agreed that the amended answer which the court has just admitted refers to the complaint so amended.\"\u00a0 The only point that appears\u00a0 to be agreed upon is that\u00a0 where the plaintiffs say in their complaint Apolonio, the same shall be read Apolinario;\u00a0 but it was not agreed that the party Apolinario might not be known by any other name than that of Apolinarlo, nor that the defendant should not try to prove another name as that of Isidario.<\/p><p>It is also in all respects inexact that the land in Talamban, the subject of the complaint, which formerly belonged to Apolinario Cedeno, is diff from the land in Talamban which the defendant claims\u00a0 was sold by Isidario Cedeno to Juan Basa Villarrosa:\u00a0\u00a0 The complaint says: \"Boundar On the\u00a0 north, by\u00a0 Calixto Nejarda; on the south, by the river called Grande and Alejandro Mirafuentes; on the east, by the same river, Grand and on the west, by a large rock.\" Defendant's Exhibit 2 says: \"Bounded the north by Calixto Nejarda; on the east by Calixto Nejarda; on the so by Alejandro\u00a0 Mirafuentes; and on the west\u00a0 by Miguel\u00a0 and\u00a0 a\u00a0 large rock.\"\u00a0 The plaintiffs' witnesses, Solano and Cuestas, and the plaintif themselves, Sarita and Tomas Cedeno, designate\u00a0 the same boundaries as does the defendant, giving also as the eastern boundary, besides\u00a0 the Calixto\u00a0 Nejarda\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.\u00a0 The interposition of \"Miguel\" as being on t west, written in other documents\u00a0 as on the south, is perfectly explain the defendant: It refers to Miguel Calixto who\u00a0 broke up the ground between the large rock and the land in dispute; and so it is that in subsequent documents it also appears as the western boundary.<\/p><p>For the preceding reasons, the judgment appealed from is affirmed,\u00a0 wit the\u00a0 costs of this\u00a0 instance against\u00a0 the appellants.<\/p><p><em>Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson, <\/em>and <em>Trent, JJ.<\/em>. concur.<\/p><\/div>",

Axt.\u00a0 A police officer, Fausto Duque, testified that this defendant made a voluntary confession to him while under arrest, in the course of which he admitted that in company with Ramon Matic he went out to the launch\u00a0 Bolinao; that he himself went aboard and stole the trunk in question, which he turned over to Ramon Matic, who was waiting in a boat, while Arsenio Salvation was in the lighthouse keeping watch; and that later, after breaking open the trunk they three\u00a0 divided the contents among themselves\u00a0 and threw the empty trunk in the sea. It was further established by the testimony of the clerk of the municipal court of the city of Manila that this appellant had been sentenced for theft on the 14th day of May, 1909, and on the 2nd and 11th of\u00a0 October\u00a0 of the same year.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>The accused, testifying in his own behalf, denied that he had confessed to the police officer Duque, and disclaimed all knowledge of the robbery. The trial judge evidently believed the testimony\u00a0 of the witnesses for\u00a0 the prosecution, and\u00a0 we are of opinion that if this testimony be accepted as true, there can be no\u00a0 reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the appellant. Without considering whether any value should be given\u00a0 to the fact\u00a0 that part of the stolen property was found in the possession of the wife of the accused and part in the possession of his sister, there can be no question that the testimony of Maximo Guillermo as to\u00a0 the fact that he saw the stickpin in question in the shirt\u00a0 of the appellant was competent and admissible; and that this testimony, unexplained, furnishes strong\u00a0 and convincing evidence as to the guilt of the accused.\u00a0 We are of opinion that his confession made to the policeman Duque, taken together with the evidence as to\u00a0 his possession of the stolen pin, establishes his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>Some question is raised as to the\u00a0 truth of the testimony of Duque touching the admissions and confessions of the appellant, and as to the admissibility of his testimony in this regard.\u00a0\u00a0 It affirmatively appears from the record, however, that the statements were made voluntarily\u00a0 and without the exercise\u00a0 of undue influence.\u00a0\u00a0 No sufficient reason is suggested in the record which would justify us in believing that the policeman swore falsely in this regard.\u00a0 Much has been made by the appellant of the fact that the police officer to whom\u00a0 these admissions were made testified that another police officer, Albert E. Axt, was present at the time the confessions were made, and that Axt, when testifying, declared that this\u00a0 accused had denied all knowledge of the crime when arrested\u00a0 by him.\u00a0 It is contended that the testimony of these witnesses is in conflict, but we think that the alleged contradictions\u00a0 are more apparent than real, and that the testimony of these witnesses does not disclose an irreconcilable conflict. It would appear that the policeman Axt, when he testified as to the denial of the accused, was referring to the\u00a0 occasions when he made the arrest and the search of the houses of the accused, while the policeman Duque, when he testified as to admissions made by the accused, was referring to conversations had on another occasion.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>We are of opinion that the judgment of conviction\u00a0 and the\u00a0 sentence imposed by the trial court should be affirmed, with the costs\u00a0 of this instance against the appellant.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/><em>Arellano, C, J., Mapa<\/em> and <em>Johnson, JJ.<\/em>,\u00a0 concur.<br\/><em>Trent, J.,<\/em> dissents.<br\/><\/p><\/div>",

AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br\/>\n<br\/>\nD E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">Appeal through a bill of exceptions by the defendants Toribio Alarcon and Teodora Raymundo, the latter in substitution of Julian Santos,\u00a0 from the judgment\u00a0 of June\u00a0 21, 1911, whereby\u00a0 the Honorable Simplicio del Rosario, judge, held the injunction\u00a0 issued by\u00a0 the\u00a0 court on\u00a0 February\u00a0 25, 1909, to be final and\u00a0 ordered\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendants\u00a0 to\u00a0 cease to occupy the tracts specified in\u00a0 the\u00a0 judgment,\u00a0 adjacent to the canal or ditch, to remove their\u00a0 respective dikes, designated in the rough sketch under letters B, A, K, I, S, and J, to the places where they had formerly been located, shown by line Q-4, as regards Teodora Raymundo, and line P-W, with respect to Toribio Alarcon, and sentenced\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendants to pay P100 to\u00a0 the plaintiff and the costs\u00a0 of the suit.<p> By written instrument of April\u00a0 10, 1908, Toribio Bautista set forth\u00a0 that he was the owner of a tract\u00a0 of land, used as a fishpond in the barrio of Pangjolo and the sitio called Talinducan, of the pueblo of Obando, Bulacan, and bounded\u00a0 on the north\u00a0 by the fishery of Julian Santos; on the south by that of Cornelio Enriquez and that of Benito Enriquez;\u00a0 on the\u00a0 east by\u00a0 the\u00a0 Talinducan River;\u00a0 and\u00a0 on the west by the fisheries of the\u00a0 defendants, Toribio Alarcon and Julian Santos, and a canal or\u00a0 ditch which is\u00a0 between these defendant's\u00a0 fisheries; that\u00a0 the plaintiff's said fishpond\u00a0 is formed by two parcels of\u00a0 land, one low\u00a0 and the other high, and is divided into two separate fisheries,\u00a0 although\u00a0 together they\u00a0 are\u00a0 supplied with water,\u00a0 the\u00a0 low land from the\u00a0 Talinducan\u00a0 River, and the high land\u00a0 from the said\u00a0 canal or ditch which,\u00a0 in its\u00a0 western part, is connected with and derived from the\u00a0 Obando River, terminating at the plaintiff's fishpond and serving as\u00a0 a boundary line between the defendants' fisheries; that the said ditch had existed for more\u00a0 than fifty\u00a0 years and\u00a0 since\u00a0 he had known it, from a time\u00a0 prior to\u00a0 October, 1907, had a width of about 6 meters; that the bed of\u00a0 the said ditch or canal was not owned\u00a0 by either of the defendants,\u00a0 and that, even though it were,\u00a0 such ownership\u00a0 had\u00a0 prescribed with respect to the original owner; that about the month of October, 1907, the defendants, without any right, reason, or\u00a0 title, occupied the said ditch, constructed thereon the retaining walls of their respective\u00a0 fisheries, in such\u00a0 manner that they narrowed and reduced\u00a0 the bed of\u00a0 the\u00a0 ditch to\u00a0 an approximate width of 25 centimeters, thus obstructing and almost completely preventing the passage of the water,\u00a0 on which account the\u00a0 plaintiff's fishery on the high land had been almost entirely deprived or water from the said month of October to date; that, after the filing of the\u00a0 complaint in this case and the\u00a0 hearing\u00a0 on the\u00a0 preliminary injunction, the defendants did, maliciously and with\u00a0 the sole intent of injuring the plaintiff,\u00a0 completely close\u00a0 the said canal\u00a0 or ditch, thereby totally preventing the water from flowing into the plaintiff's fishery\u00a0 which thereafter\u00a0 became\u00a0 completely dry;\u00a0 that, by the said acts, performed by the\u00a0 defendants, the plaintiff\u00a0 had suffered\u00a0 losses and damages amounting to P3,000, and that, should the former continue to occupy the said ditch, the latter would\u00a0 thereby be caused cumulatively greater and\u00a0 irreparable damage, unless\u00a0 the defendants were\u00a0 enjoined from continuing such occupation. He therefore requested that a preliminary injunction issue against\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendants, restraining\u00a0 them, until\u00a0 further order, from\u00a0 occupying the\u00a0 said\u00a0 ditch or\u00a0 any part thereof, as\u00a0 it was before October,\u00a0 1907; that no bond be accepted against\u00a0 said injunction; and\u00a0 that, after due legal procedure, the said defendants be restrained by perpetual injunction from occupying the aforementioned\u00a0 ditch and\u00a0 be sentenced to pay to the plaintiff,\u00a0 as an indemnity, the sum of P3,000 and the costs of the trial.<\/p><p> The defendants,\u00a0 in\u00a0 their written answer\u00a0 of April\u00a0 24, 1908, denied generally and specifically each and all of\u00a0 the facts contained in paragraphs 2\u00a0 to 12 of\u00a0 the amended complaint,\u00a0 and, as a\u00a0 special\u00a0 defense, alleged that, along\u00a0 the boundary line separating the properties of the defendants, there had not existed\u00a0 and\u00a0 did not exist\u00a0 any kind of easement in the plaintiff's favor; that at no time and place\u00a0 had the\u00a0 latter obtained water\u00a0 which constantly and\u00a0 ordinarily came from any place along the boundary line of the defendants' properties, nor had obtained annual revenues or products from his fishery on the high land, amounting to P30 a year, inasmuch as\u00a0 at no time could the plaintiff obtain from said fishery more than\u00a0 500 fish; that the\u00a0 plaintiff's said fishery\u00a0 was at all times supplied with water\u00a0 drawn from the\u00a0 Talinducan River, although, during the season of floods, the plaintiff,\u00a0 ever since he became possessed\u00a0 of his\u00a0 fishery described\u00a0 in\u00a0 paragraph 2\u00a0 of the complaint, always obtained\u00a0 permission from one of the defendants to let\u00a0 off his extra water\u00a0 supply, as his fishery was\u00a0 of a higher elevation than that of\u00a0 the defendants, but that the place had always been a mangrove swamp where\u00a0 Julian Santos had his shrubs; that the two fisheries of\u00a0 the plaintiff were in change of Toribio Alarcon for a period of about four years, during which time the latter\u00a0 always obtained his water supply\u00a0 therefor from the Talinducan River; that the plaintiff\u00a0 never obtained at any time nor during\u00a0 four years, as the\u00a0 product from the sale of fish from his fisheries, the amount stated in the amended complaint; that,\u00a0 before Alarcon had\u00a0 the said fishery, it had for three years been in charge of Silvestre Dilag who,\u00a0 during that\u00a0 whole period, had not received from the sale\u00a0 of fish taken therefrom more than P130, and did not at any time supply the\u00a0 said fishery with water from the Obando\u00a0 River, but always\u00a0 from the Talinducan River.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>As a counterclaim the defendants alleged that the plaintiffs had\u00a0 caused\u00a0 them losses\u00a0 and\u00a0 damages aggregating P3,000 by preferring charges\u00a0 against\u00a0 them in the justice of the\u00a0 peace\u00a0 courts of Polo and Obando, for infraction of municipal ordinances.\u00a0 They therefore asked to\u00a0 be absolved from the\u00a0 complaint and that the plaintiff\u00a0 be sentenced to pay P3,000 for losses\u00a0 and damages, and the costs of the trial.<\/p><p> The case came to trial, oral evidence was introduced, the documentary\u00a0 evidence was included in\u00a0 the record and an ocular inspection also made by the court of the place where the said fisheries were located, and as a result thereof the judgment aforementioned was rendered.<\/p><p> The question\u00a0 at issue between the parties to this\u00a0 suit is whether the bed of the canal through which water flows from the Obando\u00a0 River to\u00a0 the fishery\u00a0 of the plaintiff, Toribio Bautista, and the land through which the said canal is opened, belongs to the defendants or to the public domain, because such canal or watercourse is a branch of the aforementioned Obando River.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 The defendants have not proved that both or either of them were or was the legitimate owners or owner of the land in which the said watercourse or canal lies, and, therefore, being an arm of the Obando River, it belongs, together with the water flowing through it, to the public domain and partakes of the nature\u00a0 and conditions of the river on which it depends.<\/p><p> In order to arrive at a just and proper conclusion in this\u00a0 case, it is necessary to present here the legal provisions that govern in the matter at issue.\u00a0 Article 339, No. 1, of the Civil Code provides:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p> \"Property of public ownership is:<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"1. That destined to the public use, such as roads, canals, rivers, torrents, ports, and bridges constructed by the State, and\u00a0 banks, shores, roadsteads,\u00a0 and that of a similar character.\"\u00a0 <\/p><\/blockquote><p> Article 407 of the same code prescribes:\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"The following are of public ownership:<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 \"1. Rivers and their natural beds.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 \"2. Continuous or intermittent waters from springs or brooks running in their natural beds and the said beds.\u00a0 <\/p><p> \"3. Waters rising continuously or intermittingly in lands of said public ownership.<\/p><p> \"4. Lakes and ponds formed by nature on public lands and\u00a0 their beds.<\/p><p> \"5. Rain water running through ravines or sandy beaches, the beds of which shall also\u00a0 be public property.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p> The provisions of the above-cited articles substantially agree with those of the Law of Waters of August 3, 1866, made applicable to these Islands by the Spanish Government and\u00a0 published in the Gaceta de\u00a0 Manila of September 24, 1871, as is shown by the text of\u00a0 articles 33,\u00a0 36, 37,\u00a0 39, 72, and\u00a0 others relevant to the matter under discussion.<\/p><p> The plaintiff's petition is held to\u00a0 be\u00a0 proper whereby\u00a0 he asks for the issuance of a perpetual injunction against the defendants, restraining them from the\u00a0 occupation or usurpation of the canal or ditch, which\u00a0 is virtually an arm\u00a0 of the Obando River, belonging to\u00a0 the public domain and being for the common use,\u00a0 especially when it is duly\u00a0 proved\u00a0 in the case that the said watercourse is also a part of the public domain, and does not belong to the defendants; and therefore, the latter have absolutely\u00a0 no right whatever to\u00a0 occupy the said watercourse and to\u00a0 erect on the sides thereof the retaining walls\u00a0 of their respective\u00a0 fisheries, which walls narrowed and reduced\u00a0 the\u00a0 water flow to 25 centimeters, while the said canal or watercourse was formerly,\u00a0 up\u00a0 to October, 1907, about 6 meters wide.<\/p><p> No private person has a right to usurp possession of a watercourse, branch of a river,\u00a0 or lake of the public domain and\u00a0 use, unless it shall have been proved that\u00a0 he constructed the same within property of his exclusive ownership, and such usurpation constitutes\u00a0 a\u00a0 violation of the legal provisions\u00a0 which explicitly exclude such waterways from the exclusive use or possession of a private party.<\/p><p> From the evidence at trial it was fully proven that the defendants, without right or\u00a0 authorization,\u00a0 removed the dikes of their\u00a0 respective\u00a0 fisheries, which dikes\u00a0 had\u00a0 been erected on the banks of the said watercourse or canal, and transferred them to the center of the stream, leaving only a very\u00a0 reduced\u00a0 space for the flow of a small quantity\u00a0 of water, for the purpose of\u00a0 enlarging their\u00a0 said fisheries, thereby causing detriment,\u00a0 not only to the\u00a0 plaintiff, who, by such usurpation was deprived of the quantity of water he needed and used to get for his upper fishery, but also\u00a0 to the public, which has an unquestionable right to the use of the\u00a0 said watercourse or canal,\u00a0 a branch of\u00a0 the Obando River.<\/p><p> The canal herein concerned, together\u00a0 with the water that flows through it, drawn from the Obando River, belongs to that class of property of public\u00a0 use and\u00a0 domain which is not susceptible of private appropriation, and, therefore, the defendants could not,\u00a0 under\u00a0 any circumstances, usurp the greater portion\u00a0 of it without committing\u00a0 a notorious and glaring violation of the law that protects the properties of the\u00a0 State and the rights of its citizens.<\/p><p> Both the plaintiff and the defendants are entitled\u00a0 to utilize, for the needs and benefit of their fisheries, the water which flows from the Obando River into the said canal, but none of them may utilize and receive such water exclusively and to the detriment of the rest, as did the defendants by reducing the bed\u00a0 of the\u00a0 canal, thereby almost depriving the plaintiff\u00a0 of the quantity of water necessary for the maintenance\u00a0 of his fishery.<\/p><p> Had it been proven that the defendants, or any of them, were the owners of the land crossed by the canal in\u00a0 question, it would have devolved upon\u00a0 us to decide\u00a0 whether the plaintiff was or was not entitled to supply his\u00a0 fishery\u00a0 with water from the\u00a0 Obando River, conducted through the said canal, and whether the defendants might reduce the volume of the\u00a0 flow by constructing,\u00a0 near\u00a0 the middle of the canal, the dikes of their respective fisheries; but as the latter\u00a0 have not adduced any proof whatever that they are the owners of the said watercourse or\u00a0 canal, it\u00a0 is\u00a0 not necessary to consider,\u00a0 in\u00a0 this\u00a0 decision, the right to an easement for conveying water,\u00a0 acquired by the plaintiff through\u00a0 prescription\u00a0 for a period of more\u00a0 than\u00a0 forty\u00a0 years,\u00a0 as is demonstrated by the record.<\/p><p> Furthermore, the defendants are jointly obligated to indemnify the plaintiff for the losses and damages which they occasioned him\u00a0 by the construction of their fishery\u00a0 dikes and the reduction of the capacity\u00a0 of the said canal, in th\u00ab amount fixed by the trial\u00a0 court in the judgment appealed from, the findings of which are approved, as they are in accordance with law.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>By reason, therefore, of the foregoing conclusions, whereby the errors assigned to the said judgment are deemed to have been refuted, it is\u00a0 proper to affirm the same, as we hereby do, with the costs of this instance against the appellants.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/><em>Arellano, C.

It also alleged the lack of authority  on the part of Lino Cajili to make the lease described in the complaint, and that  the lease in question was entered into as a result of a conspiracy on the part  of the plaintiffs and said Lino Cajili to prejudice the defendant and his interests.<\/p>\n<p>The cause  went to trial and evidence was introduced for the purpose of sustaining the allegations of the complaint and of laying a basis for the relief demanded thereunder.

The first notice that the plaintiffs had  of the  refusal of the court to permit the filing of the amended complaint was that conveyed to them by the decision of the court finally disposing of the case.<\/p>\n<p>The plaintiffs took no special exception to the refusal of the court to  permit the complaint to be amended, and on this appeal assigned no  error in  that regard.  Their right to that relief was not in question in the court below and is not in question on appeal, the whole brief of the plaintiffs being confined, both in extent and in argument, to the facts alleged in the original complaint and the proofs made thereunder.  Not  having taken any exception, and not having presented the question on this appeal,  either by assignment of error or by argument, this court must assume that the plaintiffs  abandoned their request to file an amended complaint.<\/p>\n<p>This being so,  the only question remaining for our consideration is that of the right of the plaintiffs to a preliminary injunction  restraining  the  defendant, his agents  and employees, from performing  any act looking to the dispossession of the plaintiffs from  the lands described in  the complaint.<\/p>\n<p>It is a universal  principle  of the law that an injunction will not issue to restrain the  performance of an act already done.   It  is the undisputed proof in  this case, presented by the plaintiffs themselves, that, at the time  this cause was tried,  the plaintiffs had been completely dispossessed,  the defendant being in full and complete possession of the lands in question and administering them in  behalf of the church. This being so, the action for injunction fails.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment is affirmed upon this ground alone, it not being desired by this court to place  the  decision on any ground  which will prevent the  plaintiffs  from  exercising any rights of action which they may have in relation to said lands against the defendant, if any.

ROMAN MARAVILLA ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>MORELAND, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">On the 28th of June, 1904, the defendant Roman Maravilla brought an action against the defendant Fausto L. Gonzaga in the Court of First Instance of Occidental Negros, which case bore the number 321, in which judgment was obtained for a sum of money against the said Fausto L. Gonzaga. On the 3d day of May, 1907, an execution was issued upon said judgment and levied by the sheriff of said province upon the personal property belonging to the said Fausto L. Gonzaga, including a number of carabaos and carts. On the 11th day of May following, the plaintiff, Baldomero de la Rama, notified the sheriff in due form of law that he, and not Fausto L. Gonzaga, was the owner of the carts and carabaos levied upon. Thereupon the sheriff reported such notification to Roman Maravilla and demanded a bond to protect him from the results of the sale under such execution. The undertaking required having been duly furnished the sheriff proceeded to sell. On the 25th day of July, 1907, the plaintiff herein began this action for the recovery of the value of said carts and carabaos. After trial judgment was duly rendered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant for the sum of P1,496.01. This appeal is from that judgment.<br\/><br\/>It appears undisputed in the evidence that on the 29th day of May, 1899, the defendant Fausto L. Gonzaga, in consideration of the sum of P12,500, mortgaged and pledged to the plaintiff in this action certain real and personal property, among which were 40 carabaos and 40 carts; that by the month of July, 1906, the amount secured by said mortgage and pledge had increased to such an extent that the mortgagee required Gonzaga to give additional security; that in pursuance of such requirements the said Gonzaga executed and delivered to the said plaintiff a pledge of 15 carabaos and 13 carts; that said carabaos were the offspring of the 40 carabaos described in the first mortgage and the 13 carts were a part of the carts contained therein. These carabaos and carts are those levied upon by the deputy sheriff as aforesaid and are the property here in litigation.<br\/><br\/>Prior to the levy and sale referred to the parties to said mortgage and pledge on the day of 1907, made a settlement of the indebtedness which formed the basis of said mortgage and pledge and in pursuance of such settlement made and executed the agreement appearing in the following instrument:<br\/><blockquote>\"<i>Property No. 225<\/i>.\u20144th entry.\u2014Rural: Sugar estate named San Vicente, consisting of two parcels of land; the first is situated in the sitio of Quinsangan, within the jurisdiction of Bacolod. Bounded on the N. by lands owned by Senor Enrique Ca\u00f1eso, Feliciano Torino or Toriano and the river Matabang; on the E. by lands of Jose Cafiete and Adolfo Lazarte; on the S. by the river Loygoy and lands of Basilio Villanueva, Doroteo Benedicto, Balbino Montelibano, now his heirs Doroteo Benedicto, Mariano Ferrer, Fernando Pisaro or Tesalos; and on the W. by those of Paulino Medel, Juliana Toro, Pedro Toro, Agapito Baluyot, and Pedro Toro; the said first parcel has an area of two hundred and fifty-six hectares, twenty-one ares, and nineteen centares; and the second parcel is situated in the sitio of Troso, within the jurisdiction of Bacolod and Talisay, having an area of one hundred and fifty-seven hectares, twenty ares, and seventeen centares, bounded on the N. by <i>sapa<\/i> (creek) Bacon, lands of Andres Arroyo, Mariano Ferrer, the same <i>sapa<\/i>, those of the said Arroyo, Feliciano Toriano, Enrique Ca\u00f1eso and Pedro Toro; on the E. by the land of Pedro Sian; on the S. lands of Mariano Ere\u00f1eta and brothers, the river Gusa, <i>sapa<\/i> Bacon, lands of Mariano Ere\u00f1eta and brothers, River Matabang, lands of Mariano Ferrer, and Hilario Lacson; and on the W, by lands of the said Mariano Ere\u00f1eta and brothers. It appears encumbered with a mortgage constituted in favor of Baldomero de la Rama y Gosiatco, as security for the payment of the sum of twelve thousand five hundred pesos, as appears in the second entry, property bearing said number at folio six of volume twelve, temporary, of the municipality of Talisay, Fausto L. Gonzaga, of age, agriculturist and residing in this city, appears as the owner of this property, having acquired the same by purchase as shown by the first entry, bearing this number at folio 2 of the aforesaid volume twelve, temporary, of Talisay, with the exception of one-fourth portion of the lands in Troso, to wit, of the second parcel of this property which belongs to Luis Gonzaga as his '<i>legitima<\/i>,' according to the said first entry, and of the lands towards the east of the river Loygoy of which the area is not determined to pertain as the <i>legitima<\/i> of Sancha Gonzaga de Villadelgado as appears from the title now presented. An accounting having been made between Senor Baldomero de la Rama, of age, property owner and resident of this city, and Senor Fausto Gonzaga, on the third day of July, nineteen hundred and seven, the latter appeared to be indebted to the former in the sum of sixteen thousand seven hundred pesos, as capital and interest accrued and unpaid, and in view of the fact that more than eight years had elapsed without said Fausto Gonzaga having any hopes of settling his debt, he agreed with his creditor to cede this property in payment of said debt, together with other property also mortgaged consisting of a steam engine of eight H. P. and all of the other articles (<i>artefactos<\/i>?), camarin of galvanized iron, a wood built house with nipa roof, forty carts and forty carabaos, it being also agreed between them both that Senor de la Rama shall pay Dona Agatona Gonzaga, wife of Don Agripino de la Rama the sum of one thousand three hundred pesos which said Fausto Gonzaga owes, and this agreement being carried into effect, the latter cedes to the said Senor Baldomero de la Rama this property, together with the other above-described property in payment of the said sums which aggregate altogether the sum of eighteen thousand pesos, the contract having been entered into without any condition limiting the powers of the acquirer. Senor Baldomero de la Rama, whose second surname does not appear, registers the acquisition of the domain (his title to) to this property by virtue of the cession in payment of the debt, to an extent of three hundred hectares after deducting the lands belonging to Luis Gonzaga and Sancha Gonzaga de Villadelgado, without determining the extent that pertains to each of them, the mortgage stated in the beginning being canceled by virtue thereof. This property which is included also within the jurisdiction of Bacolod is registered in its entirety in the same volume and folio cited at the margin of this entry. All of the foregoing appears from the aforesaid entries and from the deed of assignment in payment of the debt, executed in this provincial capital on the third day of July, nineteen hundred and seven, and ratified in the presence of Fortunato Vadlit, notary public of this province, which document was filed in this registry at 9.30 a. m. on the thirteenth instant, according to entry No. 1087, page 61, Vol. III of the Journal, provincial form 79. And inasmuch as the document to which I refer is in accord, I hereby set my hand in Bacolod, on this 29th day of May, 1908. (Sgd.) E. A. McCreary, Treasurer, Acting Register of Deeds, Province of Occidental Negros, owing to the absence of the Fiscal Registrador.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>As appears from the terms of the agreement, so far as it is set forth, that the debt which was the basis of the transfer therein contained was also the basis of the mortgage and subsequent pledge heretofore mentioned. The consideration of the transfer of the property described in said instrument was the cancellation of the obligation on which those securities rested, so that when said instrument had been executed and its terms carried out the debt which Gonzaga owed to De la Rama was paid and satisfied. Thereafter it had no life or vitality. It was not capable of supporting any instrument or of maintaining any title or interest. The debt being canceled and discharged, the instruments which were given to support that debt failed. They ceased to have any life, vitality, or force. They could not be made the basis of any claim nor could they support any right of action. This being so, it is apparent that at the time the levy was made by Maravilla on the carabaos and carts for the purpose of satisfying the judgment which he had theretofore obtained against Gonzaga, said carabaos and carts were free from any and all liens in favor of De la Rama, the debt which formed the basis of said liens having been discharged and dissipated. At that time De la Rama had no right or interest in said property by virtue of said instruments and he could assert none thereunder. The levy and sale were therefore legal and valid.<br\/><br\/>For these reasons the judgment is reversed and the complaint dismissed upon the merits.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

On failure, to produce his registration certificate after having been  demanded to do  so by the customs authorities, a sworn complaint, signed by the duly authorized agent of the Bureau of Customs, was presented in the Court of First Instance  of this city, charging him with not having complied  with  the provisions  of Act  No.  702, touching the registration of Chinese persons.  Upon this complaint  the Honorable A. S. Crossfield issued a warrant for the arrest of the appellant on the 8th of July, 1910.  He was arrested and released on bond.   On the case being called for hearing on the first day of September of the same year, the appellant appeared and stated to the court that he was a merchant and resident of Cebu; that his witnesses,  by whom he could establish these facts, lived in that city; and that it would be very prejudicial and expensive to be compelled to bring his witnesses to the city of Manila.  Thereupon the court directed that the record as thus made  up be sent to the Court of First Instance of Cebu and that the appellant appear in that court on or before the 15th day of September, 1910, to  answer the charge  filed against him. The\" record was  received and the case duly docketed  for hearing in  the Court of First Instance of Cebu.  The appellant, through his counsel, interposed a demurrer to the complaint based upon three grounds: (1) That the court was without jurisdiction to try the case; (2) that the complaint was not drawn in conformity with the prescribed requirements; and (3) that the facts  alleged therein did not constitute a crime.  The demurrer was overruled and exception noted.  The case then proceeded to trial upon the original complaint which had been presented in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila,  and judgment was rendered directing that the appellant be  deported  by the customs authorities to the city of Amoy, China.  From this decision an appeal was taken  in due form to this Supreme  Court.<\/p>\n<p>Counsel  for the appellant makes the following assignment of errors: (1) That the court erred in overruling the demurrer; and (2)  that the court erred  in deciding  that the appellant is not a citizen of the Philippine Islands and in ordering his deportation.<\/p>\n<p>The  question involved  in .the first error assigned  is whether or not the Court of First Instance of Cebu  acquired jurisdiction upon the complaint presented  in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila.  In this complaint it is alleged that the appellant, on  or  about the 29th of June, 1910, was a Chinese laborer in the city of Manila  and was found in the Philippine Islands  without having acquired the registration certificate required by Act No.  702 of the Philippine Commission.<\/p>\n<p>The proceedings which took  place, starting in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila and terminating in the Court of First Instance of Cebu,  were in  no sense a trial and sentence  for a crime,  but simply the ascertaining of the fact whether, under the existing law, an alien of this class might remain in the country.  The order for deportation  is not a punishment for a  crime.   (Li Sing <em>vs.<\/em> U. S., 180 U. S., 486; Wong Wing <em>vs.<\/em> U.S., 163 U. S., 228; Fong Yue  Ting <em>vs.<\/em>  U. S., 149 U. S., 698; U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Wong Dep Ken, 57 Fed. Rep., 206; 1n re Sing Lee, 54  Fed Rep., 334.) Section 4 of Act No. 702 provides that any  Chinese laborer within the limits of the Philippine Islands who shall neglect, fail, or refuse to obtain the certificate of registration as required  in said act,  and who shall be found within the Philippine Islands without such certificate of registration after the  time has elapsed may be arrested upon a warrant, issued by the Court of First Instance or by the justice's court of the municipality, returnable before said Court of First Instance, by any customs official or other peace officer, and brought before any judge of a court of First Instance in  the Islands,  It will be  noted that  a Chinese laborer may be arrested upon a warrant issued by the Court of First Instance and when once arrested may be brought before any judge of such court  in the Philippine Islands. In  other words, the warrant for the arrest may be issued out of a Court of First Instance and the investigation held by  any judge of such court in this country.  The same construction  was placed upon a like provision by the United States District Court in the case of U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Long Hop (55 Fed. Rep., 58).   Again, it will be remembered that the appellant himself caused the transfer, for his own convenience, of the case from Manila to Cebu.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"In  statutory  construction,  arguments of convenience often address themselves strongly to the court.  As was aptly stated by Mr. Chief Justice  Marshall in United States vs.  Fisher (2 Cranch, 386), 'Where great inconvenience will result from a particular construction, that construction is to be avoided unless the meaning  of the legislature is plain, in which case it must be obeyed.' \"  (In re Wong Fock, 81 Fed. Rep., 558.)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>We therefore conclude that the demurrer presented by the appellant  was properly overruled by the court below.<\/p>\n<p>With  reference to the  question  raised by  the second assignment  of error, it .appears  that the  appellant  is a Chinese person, born in China in  1870, of Chinese parents. The appellant testified that his father, Yap Suanco,  came to the Philippine Islands sometime  during the year  1882, leaving his wife, Lim Sui, and family in China; that he accepted the Catholic faith, married Colasa Viyco, a Filipina, acquired property, both real and  personal, and had a fixed home, where he remained until his death, which occurred in the Province of Pampanga in 1892; that he  (the appellant) left his mother and followed his father to this country, arriving here in the same year, 1882, and remained with his father until the latter's  death; that from  the time of his father's death up to the  date of the commencement of these proceedings, he has had no fixed home for more than a few years at a time; that the greater part of this time he has been engaged in the occupation of a peddler, traveling from one place to another in the provinces, carrying his wares, and selling  the same  in small  quantities;  and that since his arrival in 1882 he has remained constantly in  the Philippine Islands with the exception of one trip to China, where he spent about one and one-half years, some fourteen years ago.<\/p>\n<p>The appellant claims to be a citizen of this country and says he never intends  to  return to China to  make that country his home, and that he does not owe allegiance to  the country of his birth.  He admitted on the trial of this case in the Court of First Instance of Cebu that he never has acquired a certificate of registration, but relies upon  his right to remain here by virtue of  being a citizen, as he claims, of the Philippine Islands.  It is not now even contended that he has a right to remain in this  country by reason of belonging to one of the exempt classes, or for any other reason except that of being,  as  he#claims, a citizen. The testimony of the appellant on  the important question as to  whether or not he has  acquired citizenship  (if such could be acquired in any manner by a Chinese person) is not corroborated or supported by any other evidence whatever. He called  no witnesses, notwithstanding the fact that  he secured the transfer  of the  case for that purpose.  The trial court did not believe that the appellant was telling the truth.   This conclusion was reached after a very careful examination of this testimony, together with the significant fact that the appellant could  not speak with any degree of fluency, either the Spanish language or any of the dialects. It would appear that, if he had been living in this country for more than twenty-eight years and traveling most of the time in different provinces, on account of the nature of his business, he  would necessarily have acquired  Spanish or one of the dialects.  Again he testified before the customs authorities in Manila that he had acquired a certificate of registration but that he had lost the same, while in Cebu he admitted that he never had acquired such a document.   The trial court very properly declined to believe the testimony of the defendant.<\/p>\n<p>The  order  or judgment appealed  from  is therefore affirmed, with costs against the appellant.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano,  C.

The owners, believing that the municipality had provided for the payment of such fines,\u00a0 turned\u00a0 over\u00a0 to the appellant five pesos for each animal that died.\u00a0 There was no\u00a0 provision whatever made by the municipality or any other entity for the imposition of such fines.\u00a0 These facts clearly constitute the crime of estafa as defined and penalized in paragraph 1, article 535, in relation with paragraphs 1, article 534, Penal Code.<\/p><p>Appellant insists that the trial court erred (1) in finding that there were present in the commission of these crimes the aggravating circumstances numbers 10, 11, and 18 of article 10\u00a0 of the Penal Code;\u00a0 and\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 in imposing the penalty set\u00a0 forth in article 399\u00a0 of said code.\u00a0\u00a0 These provisions read:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"Art.\u00a0 10.

Any public officer who, taking advantage of his official position, shall commit any of the crimes enumerated in chapter 4 of section 2 of title 13 of this book shall, in addition to the penalties therein prescribed, suffer a penalty ranging from temporary special disqualification in its maximum degree to perpetual special disqualification.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>We agree\u00a0 with counsel that there were not present the aggravating circumstances mentioned in numbers 10 and 18, supra, because there is nothing to show that the crimes were committed with abuse of confidence.\u00a0 There\u00a0 were no confidential relations between the appellant and the injured parties.\u00a0 The mere\u00a0 fact\u00a0 that\u00a0 people had reposed in the appellant sufficient confidence to elect him to a public office does not constitute the aggravating circumstance set forth in number\u00a0 10.\u00a0 In order to constitute this circumstance the confidence between the parties must be immediate and personal and such as would give\u00a0 the accused person some advantage or make it easier for him to\u00a0 commit\u00a0 the criminal act.<\/p><p>These three cases were tried together in the court below. The judgments in all three of these cases were rendered at the same time; in fact, the three judgments are contained in the same\u00a0 paragraph\u00a0 and were pronounced\u00a0 at the same time.\u00a0 A recidivist is one who at the time of\u00a0 his\u00a0 trial for one crime shall have been convicted by final judgment of another crime embraced in the same title of the Penal Code. At the time the trial court held that the accused was twice a recidivist there was no\u00a0 final judgment against him.\u00a0 In fact, the judgments\u00a0 imposed could\u00a0 not have become final until after\u00a0 the expiration\u00a0 of fifteen days and\u00a0 this only in the event that an appeal was not taken.\u00a0 So it\u00a0 is clear that the aggravating circumstance mentioned in number 18 was not present.<\/p><p>It is insisted that the appellant in committing these crimes did not take advantage of his\u00a0 public position or office.\u00a0 In this we cannot agree with counsel.\u00a0 The fact that the appellant was councilman at the time placed him in a position to commit these crimes.\u00a0 If he had not\u00a0 been councilman he\u00a0 could not have induced the injured parties to pay these alleged fines.\u00a0 It was on account of his being councilman that the\u00a0 parties believed that he had\u00a0 the right to collect fines and\u00a0 it was for this reason that they made the payments. It is true\u00a0 that he had no right to either impose or collect any fines whatsoever.\u00a0\u00a0 It is also true that a municipal councilman is not an official\u00a0 designated by law to collect public fines.\u00a0 But these facts do not\u00a0 destroy or disprove the important fact that the accused did by taking advantage of his public position deceive\u00a0 and defraud the injured parties out of the money which they paid him.\u00a0 This holding is not in conflict with the doctrine enunciated in the case of United States <em>vs<\/em>. Casin (8 Phil. Rep., 589).\u00a0 In that case Casin and Calleja, the offended party, lived in the same house.\u00a0 Calleja gave to Casin two pesos for the purpose of buying her\u00a0 a cedula in\u00a0 order that she might institute a civil action in the courts. Casin received the\u00a0 money\u00a0 promising to\u00a0 buy the cedula. He neither purchased\u00a0 the cedula nor returned the money but converted it to his\u00a0 own use.\u00a0\u00a0 The fact that he was a councilman did not have anything to do with his receiving the two pesos. He acted\u00a0 purely\u00a0 in\u00a0 his\u00a0 private capacity.\u00a0\u00a0 Consequently, he\u00a0 did\u00a0 not in\u00a0 any manner\u00a0 take advantage of his public position.<\/p><p>It is also insisted that it was\u00a0 error to take into consideration the aggravating circumstance number 11 and also\u00a0 impose the penalty provided in\u00a0 article 399.\u00a0 The aggravating circumstance number 11 was found to be present and\u00a0 was taken into consideration for\u00a0 the purpose of increasing\u00a0 the penalty which the\u00a0 law says must be imposed.\u00a0 The\u00a0 disqualification mentioned\u00a0 in article 399 is a part of the penalty to be imposed.\u00a0 This penalty is never imposed as an aggravating circumstance because from the very nature of the penalty it cannot be so considered.<\/p><p>There being present\u00a0 one aggravating circumstance\u00a0 and no extenuating circumstances in the commission of these crimes, the penalty should be imposed in each case in its maximum\u00a0 degree, which is four months\u00a0 of <em>arresto\u00a0 mayor.<\/em><\/p><p>In the first and second\u00a0 cases the penalties imposed are in accordance with the law; in\u00a0 the third the court erred\u00a0 in imposing six mpnths instead of four.\u00a0 This penalty is, therefore, reduced to four\u00a0 months.\u00a0\u00a0 In all other respects the judgments appealed from are affirmed, with costs against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<\/p><p><em>Arellano, C.

I am\u00a0 of the opinion that Act No. 1761 which amended and\u00a0 repealed Act No.\u00a0 1461 of the Philippine Commission\u00a0 has in no way affected the charter of Manila.\u00a0\u00a0 The Municipal Board then had legislative\u00a0 authority which was conferred upon it, and the authority thus conferred included the making of ordinances necessary to carry out the powers conferred\u00a0 by the charter,\u00a0 and to fix the\u00a0 penalty within certain limits, and one of\u00a0 these powers was to provide for\u00a0 the closing of opium joints and\u00a0 to prohibit the keeping\u00a0 or\u00a0 visiting of places where opium\u00a0 was smoked.\u00a0 <\/p><p> \"The ordinance in question prohibits places where\u00a0 opium is smoked or\u00a0 dealt in\u2014prohibits\u00a0 opium joints.\u00a0 The two sections\u00a0 (of the ordinance) are practically the\u00a0 same. The ordinance prohibits the visiting or being present at a place where opium is smoked\u00a0 or sold,\u00a0 and I am\u00a0 of\u00a0 the opinion that this is within the power of the\u00a0 board.\u00a0 The fact that the ordinance adds to the visiting,\u00a0 specifically mentioned in the powers of the board, 'or being present at' does not affect the legality of the prohibition of visiting.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 * The fact that the charter provides that no fine shall exceed $100 (P200)\u00a0 and no imprisonment shall exceed six months, is not\u00a0 exceeded by the statement\u00a0 that either one of the penalties provided may be imposed by\u00a0 adding thereto that both the fine and imprisonment may be imposed in the discretion of the court.\u00a0 <\/p><\/blockquote><blockquote><p> \"With regard to the objection made\u00a0 on the ground that the punishment is cruel\u00a0 and unusual because it provides for the punishment of innocent persons, I am of the opinion that the ordinance\u00a0 does\u00a0 not so\u00a0 provide.\u00a0 It must clearly be read\u00a0 and\u00a0 understood\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 light of the general rule with regard to the intention of persons when violating its terms. The person going to a place where opium was sold without knowledge of the fact would not be visiting it in contemplation of this ordinance; neither if he had legal business to transact at a place where opium was sold and visited it for the purpose of transacting his lawful business only and so doing\u00a0 he would not be\u00a0 visiting\u00a0 a place where opium\u00a0 is sold in contemplation of this ordinance.\u00a0 I am of the opinion that the grounds of the demurrer are not well taken.\u00a0\u00a0 The demurrer is overruled.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p> Immediately following the overruling of the demurrer the said defendants were placed upon trial.\u00a0\u00a0 After hearing the evidence the Honorable A.

It\u00a0 would be difficult to\u00a0 find\u00a0 an ordinance\u00a0 which is more nearly within the express powers conferred upon a municipal board than that in\u00a0 the present case for the adoption of\u00a0 said Ordinance No. 152.\u00a0\u00a0 In\u00a0 our opinion, the\u00a0 Municipal Board of the city\u00a0 of Manila had full authority to\u00a0 adopt said\u00a0 ordinance and the\u00a0 same is also in accordance\u00a0 with the general\u00a0 spirit\u00a0 and\u00a0 policy\u00a0 of\u00a0 the laws of\u00a0 the\u00a0 state relating to the use of opium.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 With reference\u00a0 to the second assignment of error, the appellant alleges that it is unreasonable,\u00a0 in that section 3 imposes\u00a0 a penalty upon any\u00a0 person who\u00a0 may visit the places described in said ordinance.\u00a0 The appellant attempts to make it appear\u00a0 that\u00a0 any person, even though lawfully visiting\u00a0 the\u00a0 places described in\u00a0 said ordinance,\u00a0 might be punished.\u00a0 We think this interpretation of\u00a0 said ordinance is not justified.\u00a0 It will be noted that the complaint charges that the defendants <em>\"unlawfully\u00a0 visited, etc<\/em>.\"\u00a0 This allegation must be proved by\u00a0 the prosecution.\u00a0 Under this\u00a0 allegation the defendants may prove, if the fact\u00a0 exists,\u00a0 that they visited the place described in the complaint lawfully and not in violation of the provisions nor the spirit of said ordinance.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>Ordinances of the class\u00a0 under consideration are not at all\u00a0 uncommon.\u00a0 Many cities\u00a0 have\u00a0 ordinances\u00a0 prohibiting people from visiting houses\u00a0 of ill\u00a0 fame;\u00a0 children\u00a0 from visiting saloons where alcoholic liquors are sold, and many others of a similar class. In the case of State <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>. Botkin (71 Iowa, 87)\u00a0 the\u00a0 facts are very similar to those in the present case.\u00a0 In that case an ordinance\u00a0 of the\u00a0 city of Des Moines of the State of Iowa provided that \"any person who should be found in or frequenting any disorderly house shall be subject to a fine.\"\u00a0 Under that ordinance the defendant (Botkin) was arrested, arraigned and convicted of a violation of the same\u00a0 in the municipal\u00a0 court\u00a0 of said\u00a0 city. He applied\u00a0 for the writ of\u00a0 habeas corpus in the courts of the\u00a0 State,\u00a0 upon the ground' that he was\u00a0 being unlawfully restrained of his liberty, by reason of the sentence under said ordinance, alleging,that the\u00a0 ordinance was void. The court\u00a0 of first instance\u00a0 (the district court) granted the writ of\u00a0 habeas corpus upon the ground that the ordinance was void and illegal.\u00a0\u00a0 From that conclusion an appeal was taken to the supreme court of the State of Iowa, where the decision of the court of first instance was reversed, the court holding that the city had full authority to adopt said ordinance and that the sentence of the municipal court was valid, and ordered the defendant returned to the\u00a0 custody of the city authorities for\u00a0 the enforcement of the decision of said municipal court.\u00a0\u00a0 The district court in that case (State\u00a0 <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>. Botkin) held that the ordinance was void\u00a0 for the reason that it failed to prescribe\u00a0 that, to render one guilty of the offense prohibited, he\u00a0 shall be unlawfully in the house and\u00a0 that,\u00a0 under the language of the ordinance, one\u00a0 found\u00a0 in\u00a0 a disorderly\u00a0 house is guilty,\u00a0 though he\u00a0 be there for a lawful or innocent purpose.<\/p><p> The supreme court,\u00a0 in\u00a0 passing\u00a0 upon that\u00a0 part of\u00a0 the decision of the lower court, said':<\/p><p> \"This decision [position]\u00a0 of the\u00a0 court below is clearly unsound, and in violation of the familiar rules of the construction and interpretation of statutes.

These rules are of constant application in the administration\u00a0 of the criminal law.\"\u00a0 (Introduction to Blackstone's Commentaries,\u00a0 by Judge Cooley,\u00a0 sec.\u00a0 2, pp. 59-62.\u00a0 Ex Parte Johnson, 73 Cal., 228.)<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>In the present case we have the\u00a0 express\u00a0 provision of the\u00a0 charter of the city of Manila\u00a0 (Act No.\u00a0 183, sec. 17, par.\u00a0 (<em>ff<\/em>) )\u00a0 conferring upon said city the right to adopt the ordinance in question (152).\u00a0\u00a0 The punishment-imposed by said ordinance is also within the express power of said city,\u00a0 as defined by its charter.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>In our opinion the contention that the ordinance in question is unreasonable is not tenable.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>Courts\u00a0 are\u00a0 slow to\u00a0 pronounce statutes invalid or void. The question of the validity of every\u00a0 statute is first determined by\u00a0 the legislative\u00a0 department of the government itself, and the courts should resolve\u00a0 every presumption in favor of its validity.\u00a0 Courts are not justified in\u00a0 adjudging statutes invalid, in the face of the conclusion\u00a0 of the legislature, when the question of its validity is at\u00a0 all doubtful. The courts must assume that the validity of the statute Was fully\u00a0 considered by the legislature when adopted.\u00a0 Counts will not presume a statute invalid unless it clearly appears that it falls within some of the\u00a0 inhibitions of the fundamental laws of the state.\u00a0 The wisdom or advisability of a particular statute is not a\u00a0 question\u00a0 for the\u00a0 courts\u00a0 to determine\u2014that is a question for the legislature to determine.\u00a0 The courts may or may not agree with\u00a0 the legislature upon the wisdom\u00a0 or necessity of the\u00a0 law.\u00a0 Their disagreement,\u00a0 however, furnishes no basis for pronouncing a statute illegal.\u00a0 If the particular statute is\u00a0 within\u00a0 the constitutional power of the legislature\u00a0 to\u00a0 enact, whether the courts agree or not in the wisdom of its\u00a0 enactment, is a matter of no concern. Upon the other hand, however, if the statute covers subjects not authorized by the fundamental laws of the land or its constitution,\u00a0 then the courts are not only authorized but are justified in pronouncing the same illegal and\u00a0 void, no matter how wise or-beneficent such legislation may seem to be.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>Courts are not justified in measuring\u00a0 their opinion with the opinion of the legislative\u00a0 department\u00a0 of the\u00a0 government,\u00a0 as expressed\u00a0 in statutes,\u00a0 upon\u00a0 questions\u00a0 of\u00a0 the wisdom, justice or advisability of a particular law.<\/p><p> In\u00a0 exercising the\u00a0 high\u00a0 authority conferred\u00a0 upon\u00a0 the courts to pronounce valid\u00a0 or invalid a\u00a0 particular\u00a0 statute, they are\u00a0 only\u00a0 the administrators\u00a0 of the\u00a0 public will, as expressed in\u00a0 the fundamental laws\u00a0 of the land.\u00a0\u00a0 If an\u00a0 act of the legislature is held illegal, it is not because the judges have any control\u00a0 over\u00a0 the\u00a0 legislative power, but because the act is forbidden by the fundamental laws of the land and because the will\u00a0 of\u00a0 the people, as declared by such fundamental laws, is paramount and must be obeyed, even by the\u00a0 legislature.\u00a0\u00a0 In pronouncing a statute illegal, the courts are simply interpreting the\u00a0 meaning, force and application of the fundamental laws of the state.\u00a0\u00a0 (Lindsay et al.\u00a0 <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>.

In this letter  it appeared that  Diaoco requested Lim Chungque to sell him three cans of opium, said letter being accompanied by the sum of P120 as the price of the opium.  Not having the opium  at his disposal just then, the Chinaman Lim Chungque told the agent to come back early the next day to get it, and said agent did in fact visit  the store of Lim Chungque about 5 a. m. and the latter delivered to him three  cans of opium which he had secured from another source, and he received  from the agent the said sum of P120, the price of the opium.  The agent then went away with the three cans of opium, but two hours later returned  carrying  the  same three cans and  accompanied by the defendant, who immediately told Lim Chungque that he was an inspector to search for contraband goods and  denounced the said  Chinaman for  having  unlawfully sold the three cans of opium, telling  him that the crime is punished with many years of imprisonment, besides a fine, and  threatening him with arrest and  indictment for the crime he had committed.  The Chinaman Lim Chungque at once  asserted his innocence and invited the defendant to make a search of his store, but the latter merely said that the Chinaman had  unlawfully sold the opium and that it was his intention to take  the said Lim Chungque before the authorities under arrest and charge him with a violation of the Opium Law, but told him if he wished to get.out of 'this fix' he had to pay the defendant the  sum of P2,000. The Chinaman Lim Chungque replied that he did not  have that sum, and, after some talk, the defendant agreed not to take him before the  authorities  and  not to charge him with a                      violation of the Opium Law, provided that he give up the sum of Pl,000, and because of this intimidation,  through fear of arrest and trial as a violator of the Opium Law, the Chinaman  Lim Chungque delivered to the  defendant the sum of P1,000, which the defendant accepted.  He  then went away without arresting Lim Chungque or afterwards denouncing him for an alleged violation of the law.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>After  a careful examination of the  evidence  adduced during the trial of the cause, we find that the findings of fact made by the lower court are a true and correct resume of such evidence and that the same  shows that the defendant is guilty of the crime of robbery  beyond peradventure of doubt.   (U. S. <em>vs.<\/em>  Flores,  19 Phil. Rep., 178;  decision of the supreme court of Spain of the 24th of June, 1875; U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Smith, 3 Phil.

Therefore the judment of the lower court is hereby modified, and the  defendant is hereby sentenced to be imprisoned for a period of six years ten months and one day of presidio mayor, to indemnify Lim Chungque in the sum of Pl,000, the  amount of money robbed, with the accessory penalties of the law, and to pay the costs.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

(B. of E., 7 &amp; 8.)<\/p><p>By order of January 17, 1911, the court passed upon the motion in conform with the petition made therein, ordering, in accordance with articles 11 of the Spanish Law of Criminal Procedure of 1882, applicable in the pres case, the suspension of the civil complaint until final judgment should rendered in criminal case No. 970, for robbery in a gang, with respect the defendant Leocadio Pajarillo.\u00a0\u00a0 (B. of E.,\u00a0 14 &amp;\u00a0 15.)<\/p><p>But on May 13, 1911, the court ordered the dismissal of case No. 970, fo robbery in a gang, with respect to Leocadio Pajarillo and\u00a0 his\u00a0 three accomplices (who were serving life sentences) and declared\u00a0 canceled the bonds\u00a0 filed for said\u00a0 accused and the costs <em>de oficio.<\/em>\u00a0 (B. of E<\/p><p>On July 26, 1911, the plaintiff Elias\u00a0 Oro presented a motion\u00a0 requestin revocation\u00a0 of the order of January 17, 1911, wherein suspension of the complaint was ordered; by this motion raising\u00a0 the present question.<\/p><p>The court refused the revocation asked and overruled the motion by its decree of August 7, 1911, to which the plaintiff Elias Oro objected\u00a0 and appealed to this court by means of a bill of\u00a0 exceptions.<\/p><p>The reason for denying revocation of the order of January 17, 1911\u00a0 that for not raising the suspension of the pending civil complaint\u00a0 is that order of dismissal on May 13, 1911, with respect to\u00a0 Leocadio Pajarillo accomplices, is not a final judgment and therefore prevents the\u00a0 present against them of a new complaint for the same crime, for said dismissal h to be ordered before any trial, before any answer to the complaint drawn up against these defendants, just as if it might be said that if at any Leocadio Pajarillo and his\u00a0 accomplices\u00a0 in\u00a0 murder should be free from life sentences, not having\u00a0 been placed in real jeopardy in\u00a0 case No.\u00a0 9 they could still be tried for the crime of robbery in a gang,\u00a0 from which pending civil action arose, and it therefore follows that this would rem suspended, subject to such contingency, that is, the possibility that th action for such robbery in a gang might be prosecuted at some more\u00a0 or less remote time, and until then, until this\u00a0 possibility\u00a0 should\u00a0 have disappeared, the civil action must\u00a0 remain in suspense, dependent, not u criminal case pending final judgment, but\u00a0 upon a criminal complaint merely possible\u00a0 at some indefinite time.<\/p><p>Later, on February 14,\u00a0 1912, this Supreme Court\u00a0 rendered a\u00a0 judgment execution in\u00a0 the oft-cited case No. 970, against Onofre Odruna <sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> and accomplices for robbery in a gang,\u00a0 dismissing the\u00a0 complaint presented, the costs <em>de oficio,<\/em> and ordering the defendants set free immediately. Thus was this\u00a0 case of robbery in a gang,\u00a0 perpetrated\u00a0 against Elias Or finally\u00a0 terminated. Dismissal was due to the application to the defend of the Amnesty Proclamation of the President of the United States of Jul 4, 1902.<\/p><p>If Leocadio Pajarillo\u00a0 and his three accomplices had remained subject to case No. 970, they would, like Onofre Odruna and his associates,\u00a0 have h the amnesty applied to them, and they must necessarily be regarded <em>a priori<\/em> in any possibility of a new complaint as included in the Proclamation of the\u00a0 President of the United States.<\/p><p>The trial court's order of May\u00a0 13,\u00a0 1911,\u00a0 wherein said case\u00a0 No. 970 w dismissed with respect to Leocadio Pajarillo\u00a0 and his accomplices, is fi and in force.<\/p><p>The decree of the same court of August 7, 1911, which is appealed from, must be revoked.<\/p><p>In accordance with article\u00a0 130\u00a0 of the Penal Code, criminal\u00a0 responsibility extinguished:\u00a0 \"1:\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 3.\u00a0\u00a0 By amnesty, which completely extinguish the penalty and all its effects.\"\u00a0 And\u00a0 in accordance\u00a0 with the said\u00a0 La Criminal Procedure, article\u00a0 116\u00a0 whereof has been cited, extinction of penal action does not carry with it extinction of the civil, unless the proceeds from a declaration\u00a0 in a final judgment that the fact from which the civil might arise did not exist.\u00a0 In the\u00a0 other cases, the person en the\u00a0 civil action may exercise it in the jurisdiction and in the proper against the person who\u00a0 may be liable for restitution\u00a0 of the\u00a0 thing\u00a0 an reparation or indemnity for the damages suffered.<\/p><p>The decree appealed from,\u00a0 of August 7, 1911, is hereby revoked, with th costs <em>de oficio. <\/em><\/p><p><em> Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson,<\/em> and <em>Trent, JJ.<\/em>, concur.<br\/><br\/><br\/><\/p><p><\/p><hr align=\"left\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> U.

From this  judgment they appealed to this court.  The principal question  raised by the appellants in their brief refers to matters of fact which have,  in our opinion, been correctly decided in the judgment appealed from.   The  evidence adduced  conclusively supports the findings of fact contained in the said judgment,  which, therefore,  must be sustained.<\/p>\n<p>The  appellants invoke in their brief  the  presumption of law established in paragraph  5 of section 334 of the Code of Civil  Procedure.   This legal provision reads as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Disputable presumptions.\u2014The following presumptions are satisfactory, if uncontradicted, but they are disputable and may be contradicted by other evidence:<\/p>\n<p align=\"center\">*      *       *       *       *      *       *<\/p>\n<p>\"6. That evidence willfully suppressed would be adverse, if produced.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Furthermore, the appellants say in their brief  with respect to the presumption<br\/>\naforementioned:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"All the witnesses, both for the prosecution and for the defense, all  who testified in the case corroborated one another and were unanimous in their statements that among the persons who were present at the time the alleged crime was committed,  was one  Sotero  Lagatic,  a  nephew  or brother of the complaining witness, who was precisely one of the persons  whom the latter went to look for  in order that he might serve him as a witness in this case.<\/p>\n<p>\"Now then, this man Lagatic was not presented by the prosecution, which  willfully suppressed his testimony, and dispensed with  his testimony when  it was so necessary. *  *  *  This being so, the unavoidable presumption necessarily arises that had this  omitted testimony been taken, it would have been adverse to the complaining witness.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>As is seen, all the appellants' argument rests on  the supposition expressed  by them that the testimony of Sotero Lagatic was extremely necessary to the case.   But this is not so.   It is true that Sotero Lagatic was  an eyewitness to the acts under prosecution, but he was not the only one. There were  other witnesses who  saw the same acts and they were presented  by the prosecution.  The testimony of Sotero Lagatic would merely have been corroborative of that of  the latter whose testimony, by itself alone  and entirely without that  of the said Sotero, is  amply sufficient to establish  the  crime charged.  Therefore,  the testimony of the man Sotero is by no means necessary to prove the acts alleged against the defendants.  When an act has been witnessed by several persons, the prosecution has no need, nor is it obliged, to present all such witnesses, but only those it deems necessary; it is  enough that it employ such witnesses as in its  opinion may be sufficient to prove the facts alleged  in the  complaint.  The presumption  above mentioned may not be invoked in  defense  because of the mere fact that the prosecution only presented one or a few of its witnesses and not  all of  them.  In such  a case, the, rule of presumption established in the legal provision cited is absolutely inapplicable.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellants.<\/p>\n<p><em>Torres, Carson, Moreland,<\/em> and <em>Trent, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<\/p>\n<\/div>",

The complaint was  presented and signed by the prosecuting attorney of said province.  The  justice  of the peace  held a preliminary examination  and found that there was probable  cause for believing that the defendant was guilty of the crime charged and  held him for trial in the Court of First Instance of said province.<\/p>\n<p>On the 27th  day of  September,  1909, the above complaint was filed  in  the Court of First  Instance  of  said province by the prosecuting attorney.

On arrival of the messenger at the house, he found that neither the accused nor her husband was there, and on asking Filomena, daughter of the\u00a0 accused, for the bolo, Filomena replied by saying that she knew\u00a0 nothing about\u00a0 it.\u00a0\u00a0 The offended party, on hearing this\u00a0 reply (her house and that of the accused being opposite and very\u00a0 near each other), began abusing Filomena, calling her vile names.\u00a0 The accused and her husband being\u00a0 in a neighbor's house\u00a0 nearby,\u00a0 heard these insulting words, and thereupon the accused left the house where\u00a0 she was and appeared in\u00a0 front of that\u00a0 of Benita Soyso\u00a0 and demanded\u00a0 of\u00a0 the latter an explanation of the insult to her daughter Filomena.\u00a0 A quarrel ensued between Benita and the accused, in which abusive language was exchanged.\u00a0 The accused\u00a0 becoming very\u00a0 angry and very much excited, and having in her hand at that time a short working <em>bolo<\/em>, entered the house of Benita and began\u00a0 striking her with the bolo.\u00a0\u00a0 As a result of the wounds inflicted, Benita was incapacitated and required medical attendance for a period\u00a0 of fifteen days.\u00a0 The court below, in fixing the penalty imposed, took into consideration the aggravating circumstance\u00a0 of <em>morada<\/em>, inasmuch as the crime was committed in the\u00a0 house of the offended party.

VALERIANO  CLAUSTRO,  DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/>\n<br\/>\nD E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>ARELLANO, C.J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">The subject matter of this suit is a piece of land formerly covered by the\u00a0 water of the river that runs between Vigan and Bantay, pueblos of the Province of IIocos Sur, and now dry, for the river has changed its course toward the north of the town of Vigan.\u00a0\u00a0 The plaintiffs, as successors in interest of Mariano Villanueva, now deceased, claim that the said land, which\u00a0 comprises approximately IS ares and is occupied by Valeriano Claustro, belongs to them and demand ownership or possession, thereof.\u00a0 At first, suit\u00a0 was also brought against\u00a0 Victoriana de la Cruz, but as she recognized the plaintiffs' ownership, the action was maintained only against Valeriano Claustro.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>Valeriano Claustro,\u00a0 in\u00a0 his written answer under date of March 21, 1910, alleged as a special defense that he and his wife, Isabel Bivera, had been\u00a0 in possession of the said land publicly and peaceably for twenty years, without interruption.<br\/>\u00a0<br\/>Mariano Anete,\u00a0 a\u00a0 man\u00a0 62 years old, a witness for the defendant, testified that the lot in\u00a0 question had\u00a0 formerly been covered with water, but was gradually converted into dry land as the\u00a0 result of floods,\u00a0 then shrubs and castoroil plants grew on it and\u00a0 as soon as it\u00a0 could be occupied, the defendant took it and built his house on it\u00a0 Witness did not know why the latter occupied the land, nor under what\u00a0 conditions\u00a0 he went\u00a0 there,\u00a0 and further stated that the lot of the Villanuevas, the plaintiffs, lay south of it.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>Two other witnesses of the defendant, as well as his wife, Isabel\u00a0 Rivera, testified\u00a0 that the land in question was the bed of the river that ran\u00a0 behind\u00a0 the masonry wall of the house of the Villanuevas and that about thirty years ago (they testified on April 28, 1910) it had become dry, because the river had taken a more northerly course.\u00a0 Isabel Rivera herself, wife of\u00a0 the defendant, testified that as she and her husband had no lot they occupied the land mentioned and there built their house, which was several\u00a0 times washed away by the water during the freshets of the river, and that at\u00a0 that time the house\u00a0 of the other defendant, Victorina de la Cruz\u00a0 (excluded\u00a0 from the complaint, as aforestated)\u00a0 was next to hers.\u00a0 All these witnesses testified to a possession of some twenty-three years on the part of the\u00a0 defendant, and his\u00a0 wife\u00a0 specifically stated that they considered themselves owners of the lot, merely because they had cleared it.<p><\/p><p> The defendant, however, in a complaint filed before\u00a0 the justice of the peace court against Agustin Teano for\u00a0 recovery of possession, averred on May 11, 1905, that he had been in possession of the land for ten\u00a0 years; so that, in March, 1910, he could only establish a possession of fifteen years.<\/p><p> The following facts are admitted and well proved:\u00a0 (1) That the plaintiffs are the legitimate successors in interest of Mariano Villanueva;\u00a0 and (2) tfiat Mariano Villanueva is the recognized owner of the real property which was bounded on\u00a0 the north\u00a0 by the river that runs\u00a0 between Vigan and Bantay, and now by the land\u00a0 in question, which was abandoned by the river on account\u00a0 of its flowing farther to the north where its normal channel has now been for more than thirty years.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>It is superfluous to consider\u00a0 the evidence which the plaintiffs have presented by means of three witnesses, relative to the possession,\u00a0 claimed\u00a0 by them to\u00a0 be precarious,\u00a0 of the defendant, through mere tolerance on the part of Mariano Villanueva, it being sufficient that\u00a0 the plaintiffs presented the ownership title of their land adjoining the river, acquired on December 2, 1868, which states \"that the said land is bounded on the north by\u00a0 the\u00a0 river which runs through this part of the town.\"<\/p><p> The Court of First Instance of\u00a0 Uocos Sur\u00a0 decided the suit\u00a0 by finding the plaintiffs\u00a0 to be\u00a0 the\u00a0 legitimate owners of the tract\u00a0 of land claimed\u00a0 and\u00a0 described in the\u00a0 complaint, and by sentencing the defendant, Valeriano Claustro, to quit the land and deliver\u00a0 it to the plaintiffs,\u00a0 without special finding as to costs.<\/p><p> Having heard the appeal raised\u00a0 by the\u00a0 defendant with a statement of the errors\u00a0 assigned to the judgment appealed from, the following considerations arise:<\/p><p> First.\u00a0 The law provides that the beds of rivers which remain abandoned because the\u00a0 course of the water has naturally changed belong to the owners of the riparian lands throughout their respective lengths (Civ. Cod., art. 370). If, according to the defendant's witnesses, the land disputed was the old bed\u00a0 of the\u00a0 river,\u00a0 which remained abandoned because the course of the water had naturally changed, it belongs to the owner of the riparian\u00a0 land that bordered on the river, who, according to these same witnesses, was Mariano Villanueva, and whose lot, inclosed by a wall, was bounded on the north by the said river on the date the land was acquired, December 2, 1868.<\/p><p> Second.\u00a0 The right <em>in\u00a0 re<\/em> to\u00a0 the principal is likewise a right <em>in re<\/em> to the accessory, as it\u00a0 is a mode of acquisition, provided by law, as the result of the\u00a0 right of accretion, since the\u00a0 accessory follows\u00a0 the nature of the principal, and there need not be any tendency to the thing or manifestation of the purpose to subject it to our ownership, as it is subject thereto <em>ipso jure<\/em> from the moment the mode of acquisition becomes\u00a0 evident\u00a0\u00a0 If, according to the\u00a0 defendant's witnesses, more than thirty years had elapsed since the river had abandoned its old bed, for more than thirty years such abandoned river bed had fallen to the private ownership\u00a0 of Mariano Villanueva,\u00a0 even\u00a0 without any formal act of his will; no one else since then could occupy it except as a trespasser.<\/p><p> Third. The occupation of a\u00a0 thing belonging to\u00a0 another may lead\u00a0 to another mode1 of acquisition, which is\u00a0 the prescription of ownership, whenever the possession of such thing under ordinary prescription,\u00a0 which is\u00a0 that alleged of twenty\u00a0 years, is accompanied\u00a0 by the\u00a0 other requisites prescribed\u00a0 by law,\u00a0 such as\u00a0 good faith,\u00a0 proper title and legal period of time (Civ. Cod.,\u00a0 art. 1940).\u00a0\u00a0 But in\u00a0 the present case a proper title for possession\u00a0 is entirely lacking,\u00a0 inasmuch as the only one alleged\u00a0 by the defendant's wife, to wit, that they\u00a0 had\u00a0 no other\u00a0 lot than that they cleared the land in question,\u00a0 is not a proper title, nor any title at all. Mere occupation is not a\u00a0 title of acquisition except when it concerns \"things which can be; appropriated by reason of their nature, which have\u00a0 no\u00a0 owners,\u00a0 such as animals which are the object of hunting and fishing, hidden treasure, and abandoned property.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Civ. Cod., art. 610.)<\/p><p> Fourth. If, pursuant\u00a0 to section 41 of Act No. 190, Code of Civil Procedure, occupation of real\u00a0 property may constitute a title of ownership by prescription after the lapse of ten years, yet these\u00a0 ten years must be \"after this Act comes\u00a0 into effect\" (Id., sec. 38); and for the purposes of the enforcement of the Act,\u00a0 it is not understood\u00a0 to have come\u00a0 into effect\u00a0 until\u00a0 October\u00a0 1, 1901,\u00a0 though\u00a0 it really appears to have been\u00a0 passed on August 31, 1901, and from then, 1901, to August 20, 1909, when this suit was commenced, the said ten years did not elapse.<\/p><p> By no mode or title of acquisition whatever has the defendant been\u00a0 able to acquire\u00a0 ownership\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 land\u00a0 in question, which, by express provision of the law, belonged to the plaintiffs as the\u00a0 legitimate successors in\u00a0 interest of Mariano Villanueva.<\/p><p> The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with the costs of this instance upon\u00a0 the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<\/p><p><em>Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson,<\/em> and\u00a0 <em>Trent, JJ<\/em>., concur.<br\/><\/p><\/div>",

The defendant\u00a0 Pedro Cortes is further sentenced to pay the costs of this case.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>From that decision the defendants appealed to this court and made the following\u00a0 assignments of\u00a0 error : <br\/><blockquote>\"I. The court erred in\u00a0 holding that the appellees were the owners of the lands in question at the time when they were attached by the sheriff and sold at public auction to the appellant, Pedro\u00a0 Cortes,<br\/><br\/>\"II. The court erred\u00a0 in declaring null and void the sale and transfer made by the sheriff to the appellant, Pedro Cortes; as it also erred in ordering the appellants to restore the ownership and possession of the lands in question to the plaintiffs.<br\/><br\/>\"III. The court erred in sentencing the defendants and appellants jointly and severally to pay to the plaintiffs, for products received, the\u00a0 sum of\u00a0 f*40 a year, counting from February 28, 1905.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>With reference to the first assignment of error, the lower court, in discussing the question raised by said assignment, said:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"The\u00a0 question\u00a0 raised by the defendants depends solely upon whether the lands now in question were actually sold on August 7, 1903,\u00a0 for there\u00a0 is no question as\u00a0 to\u00a0 their identity.\u00a0 Nor has\u00a0 any doubt\u00a0 been raised regarding the ownership of Salvador\u00a0 Rosales and Andrea Virey before said sale, since the defendants\u00a0 admit that the land in question belongs to the\u00a0 Rosales couple and maintain further that it continued\u00a0 to belong\u00a0 to this\u00a0 couple until\u00a0 it\u00a0 was attached, and they have by implication maintained\u00a0 by their reply that the sale made by the plaintiffs was a pretended one.<br\/><br\/>\"The\u00a0 preponderance\u00a0 of the\u00a0 evidence at the trial\u00a0 has clearly demonstrated that Romualdo Osorio\u00a0 and his\u00a0 wife really\u00a0 bought the lands in question on\u00a0 the date stated in Exhibit B of the\u00a0 plaintiffs and that the signatures affixed by the deceased Salvador Rosales and his wife Andrea Virey to this exhibit, as well\u00a0 as\u00a0 to Exhibit 4\u00a0 of\u00a0 the defendants, are genuine signatures\u00a0 of the\u00a0 vendors,\u00a0 whose signatures were not only recognized by Andrea Virey and other wit- nesses of the plaintiff, but this\u00a0 fact was also corroborated by the testimony of Catalino Sevilla, an attorney and witness on\u00a0 handwriting, called by the defendants, that\u00a0 the signatures which\u00a0 appear in the ratification of Exhibit B of the\u00a0 plaintiffs\u00a0 before the notary Sulpicio\u00a0 Trivino are the signatures of the\u00a0 deceased\u00a0 Salvador ttosales\u00a0 and Andrea Virey, after he had\u00a0 compared these signatures with other undisputed\u00a0 ones submitted by the defendant for his comparison.<br\/><br\/>\"However, weighing all the evidence together, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">I find that the signatures of the couple Salvador Rosales and Andrea Virey, affixed to Exhibit B of the plaintiffs, and those affixed to\u00a0 the ratification, Exhibit U of the defendants, were written by\u00a0 the same persons who figure therein and that therefore\u00a0 the sale made by the Rosales couple to the herein plaintiffs was perfectly legal and made on the date expressed in the document\"<\/span><\/blockquote><br\/>Upon an examination of the evidence brought to this court, we\u00a0 find that on the 7th day of August, 1903, Salvador Rosales and his wife, Andrea Virey, sold the four parcels of land under\u00a0 a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">pacto de retro<\/span>, for the sum of P500, to the plaintiff,\u00a0 Romualdo\u00a0 Osorio.\u00a0 (See\u00a0 Exhibit B, Record, p. 16.)\u00a0 That\u00a0 on the 2d day of December,\u00a0 1905, the said Salvador Rosales and Andrea Virey ratified said Exhibit B, confirming the sale\u00a0 of said land,\u00a0 before a notary public. (See Exhibit 4, Record, p. 17.)<br\/><br\/>It further appears from the record that some time before the 17th of June,\u00a0 1905 (the exact date not appearing of record), the defendant, Pedro Cortez, had secured a judgment\u00a0 in the Court of First Instance of the\u00a0 Province of Laguna against the said Salvador Rosales for a certain sum of money, and\u00a0 that upon the 17th of June, 1905,\u00a0 by virtue of\u00a0 an\u00a0 execution issued upon said judgment,\u00a0 the defendant, Mariano Manalo, as deputy sheriff of the Province of Laguna, attached the parcels of land in question and advertised the same for sale on the 20th of July, 1905; that upon the 16th of July, 1905, four days before the sale of said lands took place, the plaintiff, Romualdo Osorio, gave the\u00a0 defendant,\u00a0 Mariano Manalo, written notice that the said parcels of land belonged to him\u00a0 and requested that said attachment\u00a0 be\u00a0 raised;\u00a0 that,\u00a0 notwithstanding\u00a0 said written request, given in accordance with the provisions of section 451 of Act No. 190, the defendant Pedro Cortez, insisted upon the sale of said lands, and on the 20th\u00a0 of July, 1905, executed and delivered to the sheriff, Mariano Manalo, a bond in the sum of P500, to secure him (Mariano Manalo) against any\u00a0 loss resulting from the sale of said lands.<br\/><br\/>The principal ground upon which the appellants rely\u00a0 in their contention that the four parcels of land in question had not been sold to the plaintiff on the 7th of August, 1903, is that the said contract\u00a0 (Exhibit B) was a private document and was not sufficient, under the provisions of article 1280\u00a0 of the\u00a0 Civil Code, to transfer the ownership\u00a0 of the said\u00a0 lands to the plaintiff.\u00a0 Paragraph 1\u00a0 of said\u00a0 article 1280\u00a0 provides that:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"Acts and contracts the object of which is the creation, transmission, modification or extinction of real\u00a0 rights on real property, must be executed by a\u00a0 public instrument.\" This\u00a0 court has held that the contracts, required by said article 1280\u00a0 to be in\u00a0 writing, are nevertheless\u00a0 valid and produce legal effects between the parties, although they are not evidenced by a public document.\u00a0\u00a0 (Thunga Chui <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>.

Rep.,\u00a0 387.)<\/blockquote>Our conclusions are, therefore, with reference to the first assignment of error above noted,\u00a0 that the four parcels of land in question were sold, under a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">pacto de retro<\/span>, by Salvador Rosales\u00a0 and his wife\u00a0 Andrea\u00a0 Virey to\u00a0 Romualdo Osorio on\u00a0 the 7th of August, 1903 (Exhibit B); that on the 2d of December, 1905, said sate was ratified and\u00a0 confirmed by the same vendors (Exhibit 4); that at the time of the execution and sale of said parcels of land by the defendant (the sheriff), they belonged, not to Salvador Rosales and his wife, but to Romualdo Osorio, and that the defendant herein\u00a0 had due notice in writing\u00a0 (sec;\u00a0 451\u00a0 of Act No. 190)\u00a0 of\u00a0 that fact.\u00a0 The land sold\u00a0 under the execution at the time of the sale was not the\u00a0 land of Salvador Rosales and his wife, but the\u00a0 property of Romualdo\u00a0 Osorio. The only argument\u00a0 presented by\u00a0 the defendants\u00a0 and appellants in support of their second assignment of error above noted is the argument presented in support of the first assignment of error.\u00a0 .With reference to\u00a0 this second assignment of error, the lower court, in discussing the effect of the sale of the lands in question by the sheriff, said:<br\/><blockquote>\"Since, then, the herein plaintiffs are the absolute owners of the\u00a0 coconut lands attached, by virtue of the purchase they made from the Rosales couple, the attachment and sale at public auction by the provincial sheriff, Mariano Manalo, on petition of the plaintiff, Pedro Cortes, in the year 1905, are necessarily null and\u00a0 void and without\u00a0 legal\u00a0 effect; they are therefore liable for the losses suffered by\u00a0 the plaintiffs. According to evidence adduced by the\u00a0 defendant, Pedro Cortes, which appears in the testimony of Romualdo Vite, the\u00a0 coconut groves in question produce four thousand coconuts a year, worth from twelve to fifteen pesos a thousand, and the expenses amount\u00a0 to P3\u00a0 a thousand.\u00a0 Reckoning only P13 as the value per thousand, we find that the lands in question produce P40 a year, net.\"<br\/><br\/>\u00a0There would seem to be little necessity for saying more than has been said with\u00a0 reference to the conclusions of the lower court in relation to this second\u00a0 assignment of error, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">except for\u00a0 the fact that it has been suggested\u00a0 that a sheriff is not liable for the sale of property under an execution, when he acts in good faith; that his writ of execution is a sufficient warrant for him to protect him against loss; that the\u00a0 writ of execution is an order to sell\u00a0 the property and that he should not be held liable for the performance of his duty.\u00a0\u00a0 The writ of execution, however, directed to\u00a0 the sheriff,\u00a0 always commands him to attach and \/sell the property\u00a0 of\u00a0 the judgment\u00a0 debtor.<\/span>\u00a0 If he attaches and sells property belonging to a third person he is not obeying\u00a0 the orders contained in the writ of execution.\u00a0 It\u00a0 is difficult to see or understand upon what theory the sheriff can claim good faith when, under an\u00a0 execution\u00a0 against\u00a0 the property of A, he attaches arid sells, with due\u00a0 notice, the property of B.\u00a0 The lower court found, from the evidence, that the writ of execution was directed against\u00a0 the property of Salvador Rosales and his wife, Andrea Virey, and the proof shows conclusively that the sheriff levied upon\u00a0 and sold property belonging to Romualdo Osorio.\u00a0 The proof shows also that the sheriff had written notice, before\u00a0 the sale of the property took place, that the same did not belong to Salvador Rosales\u00a0 and his\u00a0 wife, but was\u00a0 the property of Romualdo\u00a0 Osorio.\u00a0 The writ of execution can, under\u00a0 no theory, furnish protection against the liability of the sheriff when he does not comply\u00a0 with its orders.\u00a0 If\u00a0 the sheriff attaches and sells the property\u00a0 of a person other than the judgment debtor, his responsibility is the\u00a0 same as that of any other\u00a0 person\u00a0 who takes possession wrongfully\u00a0 of the property of another.<br\/><br\/>The case of Waite\u00a0 <i>vs<\/i>. Peterson (8 Phil.

This court held in that case that in\u00a0 the Territory of Utah the accused was bound, by provisions of the Utah statute, to be present at all times during the trial, and that it was not within the power of the accused or his\u00a0 counsel to dispense with such statutory\u00a0 requirement.\u00a0 But\u00a0 on an appeal from a judgment of this nature there must be a waiver to some extent on the part of the accused when he appeals from such judgment.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>It is very clear therefore, upon the authority of this decision, that even if\u00a0 it were granted that the language of the statutes would seem to secure to the accused the right to be present when he is retried in the Supreme Court upon the record, nevertheless he waives any such right when he comes before this court by way of appeal from a judgment entered in the Court of First Instance.<\/p><p>But the\u00a0 truth is, as we have already indicated, that an examination of\u00a0 the language\u00a0 and\u00a0 the context of the provisions of law securing to an\u00a0 accused person in this jurisdiction the right to be present \"in all criminal prosecutions\" and specifically at the time when the judgment is entered, quite clearly discloses that they were not intended to have any application, and that they have no application to the proceedings in\u00a0 this court on appeal nor to the\u00a0 entry and promulgation of our judgments.\u00a0 Furthermore, the reasons which have been\u00a0 assigned\u00a0 for the original\u00a0 grant of the right of the accused to be present in all criminal prosecutions are not\u00a0 applicable to the proceedings in this court.\u00a0\u00a0 In Fielden <em>vs.<\/em> The People (<em>supra<\/em>), the court in discussing these reasons says:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"The common law required, when any\u00a0 corporal punishment was to be inflicted on the defendant, that he should be personally present before the court at the time of pronouncing the sentence. (1\u00a0 Chitty's Crim. Law (5th Am. ed), 693, 696.)\u00a0 Reasons given for this are, that the defendant may be identified by the court as the real party adjudged to be punished\u00a0 (Holt, 399);\u00a0 that the defendant may have a chance to plead a pardon\u00a0 (3 More, 265); that he may have a chance to plead or move in arrest of judgment (King <em>vs.<\/em> Speke, 3 Salk., 358); that he\u00a0 may have an opportunity to say what he can say why judgment should not be given against him (2 Hale's Pleas of the Crown, 401, 402); and that the example\u00a0 of the defendants, who have been guilty of misdemeanors of a gross and public kind, being brought up for the animadversion of the court and the open denunciation of punishment, may tend to deter others from the com- mission of similar offenses (Chitty's Crim. Law (5th ed.), 693, 696).\u00a0 It is manifest that none\u00a0 of these can apply to this court, because, first, it acts and decides only upon the record made in the court below.\u00a0 It can therefore have nothing to do with the question\u00a0 of the identity of the party whom the sheriff shall have in his\u00a0 custody for punishment.\u00a0 Nor can it entertain a motion in arrest, or a plea of pardon. And since its opinion is prepared and written out and filed with the clerk without being read from the bench, there is, when judgment of affirmance is given, no animadversion and open denunciation of punishment which could benefit bystanders. If the present plaintiffs in\u00a0 error and their counsel had been actually present in court when the judgment of affirmance, here, was entered, the law allowed them to then say or do nothing which, by\u00a0 any possibility, could\u00a0 have benefitted plaintiffs in error.\u00a0\u00a0 They were, after judgment was entered, entitled only to move for a rehearing - and this could only be done on printed petition; but thirty days were allowed in which to prepare it (93 111., 11, rule 43).\u00a0 Undoubtedly, if plaintiffs\u00a0 in\u00a0 error\u00a0 or\u00a0 their\u00a0 counsel had been\u00a0 actually present in court when the decision was announced, they would then have known what the decision was;\u00a0 but that fact was equally well made known to them\u00a0 by\u00a0 notice from the clerk - in ample time to avail of\u00a0 their right to file a petition for rehearing.\u00a0 And if, indeed,\u00a0 without any fault of theirs, more time would have been needed within which to prepare the petition for rehearing, it was\u00a0 within\u00a0 the recognized practice of this court to have\u00a0 extended the time for that purpose beyond the thirty days.\u00a0 But no claim is here made that plaintiffs in error Were not informed of\u00a0 the decision in the case in\u00a0 time to file a petition for rehearing. They did not seek to\u00a0 avail of that right, but voluntarily waived it, and prosecuted a writ of error upon the record from the Supreme Court of the United States, and it was not until\u00a0 after that was decided adversely to them, that they discovered the claimed error in the record of which amendment is now sought.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"In\u00a0 The People <em> vs.<\/em> Clark\u00a0 (1\u00a0 Park.\u00a0 Crim.

S. <em>vs<\/em>. Lewis (2 Phil. Rep., 193), we held that - <\/p><blockquote><p>\"Proceedings on appeal in the Supreme Court will not be stayed in a criminal case on account of the absence of the accused, as his presence is not necessary at the hearing.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Although it should not be necessary to do so, nevertheless, in conclusion, and to avoid misunderstanding,\u00a0 we repeat\u00a0 that\u00a0 the \"rendering,\" \"pronouncing,\" or\u00a0 \"legal promulgation\"\u00a0 of our judgments\u00a0 (whichever of those terms may be employed\u00a0 to\u00a0 designate\u00a0 the act), takes place when the clerk of this court enters judgment in accordance with the order of the court, and that when judgment is thus entered it is \"legally promulgated,\" and all the parties to the appeal are bound to take notice of the action of the court, although as a, matter of convenience the clerk invariably serves notice on the various counsel of record inviting their\u00a0 attention to the fact that the judgment\u00a0 has\u00a0 been entered.\u00a0 The\u00a0 trial courts have nothing to do with the \"rendering,\" \"pronouncing,\" or\u00a0 \"legal promulgation\" of our judgments, the duty of those courts in respect to\u00a0 our judgments being merely to see that they are duly executed when in their nature the intervention of the Court of First Instance is necessary to that end. We find no error\u00a0 in the proceedings\u00a0 had in the Court of First Instance of Pampanga looking to the execution of the sentence imposed upon\u00a0 the appellant, and without stopping to inquire whether counsel for the accused was entitled to bring these orders and proceedings before us for\u00a0 review at this time, a point which was not raised or discussed by counsel,\u00a0 we affirm the orders entered in the\u00a0 lower court from which this appeal was taken.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<\/p><p><em>Arellano, C.

When this measure was inspected  by the official sealer of weights and measures,  Rafael  Puzon, on January 10,  1910, it was found to be larger by  about 2 millimeters than the official standard and consequently had  a greater capacity than it should have had in accordance with the said standard.  This excess was  formed, as is  stated in the Attorney-General's brief, by a  kind of calzo  or chock about 2 millimeters in thickness placed between the base or bottom and the boards of its four sides, so that, by means of this chock, the said bottom was lowered and  the measure acquired a greater. depth, which may be represented by 2 millimeters multiplied by the four sides of its base.<\/p>\n<p>The real question to decide, in  our opinion, is whether the measure was, at the time it  was inspected and sealed, what it is at the present time, or whether, on the contrary, the chock  which represents the excess in its capacity wa3 put in after the measure had  been  officially sealed.  To begin with, there is no positive evidence that the latter was the case.  It has not been proved  in a  certain  and positive manner that, when the said measure was sealed, it did not already have the chock it now has; the prosecution  merely presumes or deduces this fact, from the very fact that the measure has a greater capacity than  the official standard. It appears that this deduction is founded on the presumption that every measure officially inspected and sealed is or ought  to be exactly  equal to the  official  standard;  but, aside from the fact that it is unlawful to convict anybody on a mere presumption based on another presumption, it is a fact that this presumption of the  prosecution has been destroyed by the evidence to the contrary presented  by the defense.<\/p>\n<p>That evidence consists in a measure of 25 liters'  capacity, sealed by the municipal treasurer of Bautista several months prior to the trial  of the case.  It was shown to the said treasurer, who testified that  it had actually been sealed  by himself and that  he  did not observe in  it  the least sign of alteration; that is, that said measure then had the same appearance and was  exactly in  the  same  condition  as when he sealed it.   But when this measure was examined by the treasurer himself in the presence  of the court,  it was found to be  greater in  capacity  by about 2 millimeters than the official standard (just like the measure here in question), which demonstrates one of two things: , either  that  not all the measures  sealed  have  exactly, on being sealed, the capacity they should have in conformity with the official standard, which might very well occur through carelessness or neglect on the part of the persons concerned in the operation, especially when the difference is small  or  insignificant;  or that, the contrary being the case, they may undergo,  as in fact they do sometimes, an alteration in their capacity through the natural phenomenon of the  expansion of the wood, for example, without  man's       intervention, such alteration, therefore, not being chargeable to anyone.<\/p>\n<p>The court says  in  the judgment appealed  from that this evidence is in no manner decisive for the reason that the measure presented by the defense is as illegal as that on  which the complaint  is based  and,  consequently, like the latter, might have been  tampered  with.  This  point of view  in the judgment does  not appear to  us to be correct.  It is not a question here of setting up mere conjectures or possibilities; this case has no concern with what might have been done, but with what was really and actually done  in connection with the measure in question, and on this point the testimony of the municipal treasurer  is positive to the effect that no alteration whatever was made in the condition and materials of the said  measure.  And as to the latter being illegal,  if by this word is meant that the measure has a greater capacity than  that prescribed by law, it is not a good reason for not giving the  evidence its due weight,  inasmuch as the purpose  of that evidence is precisely to prove that such illegality can and in fact does exist through no fault whatever imputable to the possessor of the measure said to be illegal.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, it is proven  by the uncontradicted testimony of one witness that the chock with which the measure in question  was provided,  was  put in  before  the latter was officially sealed.  This witness is the carpenter who made or manufactured the said measure.   He testified that it was he who put in the chock referred to, and that he did so in the office of the municipal president of Bautista, by the order of one Garcia and in the Iatter's presence.  He added that the measure was then, at the time he was testifying, exactly in the same condition as when  he  put in  the  chock and that it showed no sign whatever of alteration.  This Garcia, to whom the witness alluded and who is now deputy provincial treasurer of Pangasinan, was the inspector of weights and measures at the time when the measure herein concerned was sealed,  and he corroborates  in  a way the testimony given  by the witness, for he stated that several Chinamen  had presented  to  him  measures  of 75 and 25 liters,  the  capacity of which was less than  that of the standard measure; that,  in order to  correct the shortage, he had permitted  these  Chinamen to  put in  chocks, and that it was the preceding witness who put in the chocks in his presence in the office of the president of the municipality,  but he was  unable to state  exactly whether the measure concerned in this case was one of those so fixed.<\/p>\n<p>In view  of the  foregoing facts, we can  not hold that it has been  proven  that  the defendant did fraudulently alter  the  measure herein concerned,  after it  had  been sealed, which is the act expressly charged against him in the complaint.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, the  judgment appealed from is reversed and the  defendant acquitted,  with the costs of both  instances <em>de oficio<\/em>.   So ordered.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Johnson,  Carson, Moreland,<\/em> and <em>Trent, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TORRES, J.,<\/strong> dissenting:<\/p>\n<p>I am of the opinion that the judgment should be affirmed.

On January 4, 1910,\u00a0 a part of the building constructed was destroyed by fire, and, as result thereof, instead of the Pl,068 which the building had been\u00a0 producing\u00a0 theretofore, it subsequently produced\u00a0 only P555, until the repairs on i completed on August\u00a0 31,\u00a0 1910,\u00a0\u00a0 During the\u00a0 eight months that it took make the repairs, Lao Tarn, the successor of Lao Simco in the lease of\u00a0 the lot, was willing to pay only one-half of the P540 per month stipulated b his predecessor in the contract aforementioned. But the\u00a0 lessor family r to assent to this claim\u00a0 on the part of the lessee, Lao Tarn; and hence, present suit to compel him to pay the whole of the stipulated rent of P5 per month, for the months from January to August, 1910, the period when the building was undergoing\u00a0 repair, in\u00a0 accordance wherewith it was decided by the trial judge, who sentenced the defendant, Lao Tarn,\u00a0 to pay to the plaintiff the sum of P2,075.04, with legal interest thereon\u00a0 from the ti the presentation of the complaint, and the costs.<p>The defendant appealed through a bill of exceptions with right to a review of the evidence; but this\u00a0 can not now be reviewed, for the reason that was\u00a0 not forwarded to this court\u00a0 The sole assignment of error alleged that the trial\u00a0 court violated the law\u00a0 governing the construction of co by finding, erroneously,\u00a0 that the contract entered into does not allow defendant\u00a0 exemption from the payment of the rent for the\u00a0 lot leased, f the period of time the building was under reconstruction.<\/p><p>The clause of the contract concerned in the said assignment of error is couched in the following language:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"The tenant shall pay by way of rent to the minor proprietors or their legitimate representative the\u00a0 sum of five hundred and forty pesos (P540) monthly in advance and within the first six days of the month to which it pertains.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The first rule in the matter is that \"if the terms of a contract are clear and\u00a0 leave no doubt as to the intentions of the contracting parties, the lite sense of its\u00a0 stipulations shall be observed.\"\u00a0 (Civil Code, 1281.)\u00a0\u00a0 Th the contract in question\u00a0 being clear\u00a0 and\u00a0 leaving no doubt as to the intentions of the contracting parties, the\u00a0 trial judge, who\u00a0 had to abide the literal\u00a0 sense of the\u00a0 preinserted clause, rendered, in conformity t the judgment now on appeal.<\/p><p>But the appellant\u00a0 alleges\u00a0 that\u00a0 the\u00a0 evident\u00a0 intention\u00a0 of the contra parties was other than\u00a0 that expressed by the words of the contract, as though he meant that the second rule of interpretation of\u00a0 the same article No.\u00a0 1281 of the Civil Code, not cited\u00a0 by him, should apply, which read follows: \"If the words should appear contrary to the evident intention o contracting parties, the intention shall prevail.\"<\/p><p>And, to prove the evident intention of the\u00a0 contracting parties, he argues thus:<\/p><p>The purpose of the lessee in taking the lot was to derive profit from the rent of the building which\u00a0 he was to construct thereon; and that of the lessors, in turn, in giving a lease on the lot, was not merely nor exact obtain the stipulated monthly rent, but,\u00a0 more\u00a0 especially, to\u00a0 acquire ownership of the building constructed by the lessee at his own expense, without any outlay 'or sacrifice whatever on\u00a0 their part.\u00a0\u00a0 This\u00a0 is pro the fact that, although the contract was executed in December, 1902,\u00a0 the lessee did not begin to pay rent for the lease of the lot until April, 1 the reason that the period between these dates was the time calculated f the construction\u00a0 of the building, which in fact was finished on April 1 This indeed shows,\u00a0 says the appellant, the intention of\u00a0 the contracting parties with respect to the payment of the rent for the lot, and was no other than that the lessee should begin to pay it whenever he should beg to obtain rent from the building constructed on the lot, since the ground leased for this purpose.<\/p><p>The appellees, however,\u00a0 say: (1)\u00a0 That\u00a0 it\u00a0 is sufficient to\u00a0 see how t appellant\u00a0 himself, in his\u00a0 special defense, alleges the terms of the co order to\u00a0 be\u00a0 convinced Of the untruthfulness of what he now asserts, to wit, that although the contract was signed in December, 1902, he did not begin to pay the rent until April 10, 1903, for\u00a0 he himself stated the p that Mariano Ocampo Lao Simco took in the contract, by saying: \"As <em> lessee<\/em> for the term of eleven years, counting\u00a0 from\u00a0 April 10,\u00a0 1 consequently, if he began to pay on the 10th of April, 1903, it was because on that date he began\u00a0 to be the lessee of the lot;\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 that, if he di not begin to be the lessee nor to pay the rent until April 10, 1903, it because up to this same date\u00a0 another lessee,\u00a0 named Vy Santing, had bee paying the rent; (3) that neither is\u00a0 it true\u00a0 that the construction of building was finished on the 10th of April, 1903, but that it was begun very next day, the 11th, and was completed in July, 1903.\u00a0 Therefore it true that the rent was not collected for the period between the 9th of December, 1902, and the 10th\u00a0 of April, 1903, in consideration of the, fact that the lessee had not yet begun to\u00a0 collect rent for the building in that case, the rent for the lot should not have begun to be collected after July, 1903, which is when the construction\u00a0 of the building was fi yet, notwithstanding, in the period between April and July, 1903, the re the lot was being paid by the lessee.<\/p><p>The appellant, insisting on\u00a0 his contention; says:\u00a0 \"The possible event building\u00a0 being burned was foreseen, and\u00a0 as such a mishap might result at least its\u00a0 partial destruction\u00a0 and, consequently,\u00a0 a partial suspense the profits which the\u00a0 lessee intended to obtain from the contract of\u00a0 it was stipulated\u00a0 that\u00a0 in such\u00a0 a case the term of the lease, previous agreed upon, should be extended so as to include the whole time employed in reconstruction, which stipulation was couched in the following language term of the contract shall be understood\u00a0 to\u00a0 be extended, under the same conditions herein stipulated, for such number of months as may be required for the repairs or the rebuilding\/\u00a0 The parties,\" infers the\u00a0 a \"desired to covenant that during the time of reconstruction of the build destroyed or damaged by fire, the effects of the contract of lease should be understood to be suspended with respect to the part burned, but to be resumed for the whole time that, from the instant of the occurrence of t fire, was yet to elapse before the expiration of the term of the contract lease.\"<\/p><p>The trial\u00a0 judge in his decision stated: \"Whether the building\u00a0 be total which case it would have to be rebuilt, or whether it be partially destroy which event it could be repaired out of the money collected from the fir insurance policy, it is unquestionable that the lessee would be deprived rents, either totally or partially, as the case might be, during the months required to rebuild or repair the building; but, to compensate his loss either of the contingencies\u00a0 mentioned,\u00a0 it is\u00a0 provided that he\u00a0 shall indemnified by the owner of the lot by an extension of the term\u00a0 of the lease for a period\u00a0 of time equal to that during which he should be prevented from obtaining rents.\" Indeed it does not appear that the aforesaid clause of the contract says or can say more than what is meant by its clear and precise language. If the case had not been foreseen of possible occurence of fire, perhaps doubt might have arisen as to whether the lessee, having lost half of\u00a0 his\u00a0 building, should not be obliged to but one-half of the rent for the lot; but that case having been foreseen and stipulation having been made in provision thereof, the occurrence\u00a0 of case provided for can produce no\u00a0 other\u00a0 effect\u00a0 than that stipulated, wit, an extension of the term\u00a0 of the contract for so long a time as the repair or reconstruction should require; and if it required eight months contract has eight months longer to run beyond the eleven years original stipulated. This, and nothing more, can\u00a0 be the meaning of the clause referred to.<\/p><p>The obligation contracted by the appellant to pay P540 per month as rent for the lot, is\u00a0 expressed in absolute terms, is not subject to condition temporary or final.\u00a0 The clause of the contract in which the lessee free voluntarily contracted\u00a0 such obligation, is binding law\u00a0 which the court apply pursuant to the terms of its expression and they have no discretion power to construe it in another sense, for the reason that its wording i and leaves no doubt as to the intention of the contracting parties. Were intended that the payment\u00a0 of the rent for the lot should depend upon the renting of the building, this should have been stipulated in the contract if it was not done, the courts can not supply deficiencies in the contra introducing provisions not expressed therein.\u00a0 In order that the force a effect of the obligation\u00a0 in\u00a0 question may be suspended, it is\u00a0 requisite the courts find on trial conclusive facts which show that the terms of t contract are contrary to the evident intention of the contracting parties herein before stated,\u00a0 no\u00a0 such proof was found\u00a0 in the present case, but rather the contrary was proved, without contradiction or question of any kind.<\/p><p>If the building that was erected had not been occupied, on the supposition that it was not destroyed, for a part or any; of the time, and, consequence if no\u00a0 rent had\u00a0 been collected therefrom,\u00a0 it would neither be just nor reasonable to contend that the\u00a0 owner of the lot should not collect for part or any of the time the rent which the builder had agreed to pay, for to do so,\u00a0 would be to make the owner dependent upon\u00a0 the favorable or unfavorable outcome of the private business\u00a0 of the builder, which it would be absurd to think could have entered into the intention, whether evidence suggested, of the contracting parties.\u00a0 Likewise, if, instead of Pl,068, builder\u00a0 had obtained\u00a0 a rent of P4,000, the owner of the lot would\u00a0 not be entitled to collect a greater rent for the ground.<\/p><p>Nor would\u00a0 it aid\u00a0 toward obliging the owner of the lot to suffer a reduction of the\u00a0 rent\u00a0 which he is entitled to collect in accordance with special law of his contract, if some general rule of law should be\u00a0 established for example (in the Philippines\u00a0 there\u00a0 is\u00a0 none),\u00a0 that the\u00a0 lessor,\u00a0 in the present one, should be\u00a0 from the beginning, and not at the end of eleven years,\u00a0 a joint owner of the building; for though the ownership of the house were divided between the owner of the ground and the owner of the surface right, the latter could not, on such\u00a0 account, in the event of the partial destruction of the building, escape payment to the former of the stipulate rental price, inasmuch as only in the case where the net revenue from the subject to the payment of an annual income, be insufficient to pay the lat could such income be reduced, either by agreement or formal declaration\u00a0 of the\u00a0 courts an exception finally repealed by article 1624 of the Civil Co in the present case, neither\u00a0 was\u00a0 right to the ground\u00a0 established\u00a0 in nature of\u00a0 a perpetual lease, nor may the hypothesis be admitted of the division of the ownership of the constructed building between the owner of ground\u00a0 and the owner of the right to use the\u00a0 ground, inasmuch as the\u00a0 so stipulation which the contracting parties made, and it is the sole law w must be applied by the courts, is\u00a0 that the building in question can pass the\u00a0 ownership of the lessors only after the lapse of eleven years and eight months, counting fr the 10th\u00a0 of April, 1903.\u00a0 So that, notwithstanding any general rule of the only law applicable to the case is the special one imposed upon themselves\u00a0 by the parties in their contract.<\/p><p>Moreover, serious consequences would be brought upon the builder by making the owner of the lot, or presuming him to be, a co-participant in the ownership of the building, were this done or presumed in order to oblige h make a reduction in the rent of the lot, once there was a reduction in the of the building:\u00a0 (1). Because, if the owner must suffer a reduction, he m inversely, obtain\u00a0 an increase, as\u00a0 these\u00a0 terms are\u00a0 correlative in and, (2)\u00a0 because, before compelling him to suffer a reduction in the rent his lot in case of accident, by\u00a0 reason\u00a0 of the joint ownership he is supp to have in another's building, there would have to be, in the ordinary could the contract, attributed to this joint ownership its inherent effects, that is, rights to the owner identical to those of the builder, his presumed joint and thus would the absurdity be reached of having to attribute to the owner a right to the collection of one-half of the rent from the building, which make the contract truly one-sided, not only according to what its terms ex as stated by the\u00a0 appellant,\u00a0 but also according to what they do\u00a0 not express, pursuant to this theory.<\/p><p>No general rule of law is applicable whereby the owner of the ground may be deemed to have a right of ownership in the building from the moment the contract is executed.<\/p><p>As between the litigating parties in this case, their special law provide case of co-partnership in the building, in the clause of the contract which as follows:\u00a0 \"In the event of a fire, such repairs as the building may require its\u00a0 reconstruction, shall be\u00a0 made without loss of time, with the obligation the part of the owners of the land to contribute, pursuant to the preceding clause, the part corresponding to them of the value of the insurance policy the extent of which amount they shall be deemed co-participants in the building but they renounce and disclaim all profits and losses which may fall to the share by reason of such co-participation, and the period of the contract sh be understood to be extended,\u00a0 under the same\u00a0 conditions herein stipulate for such number of months as may be required for the repairs or the rebuilding.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (B. of E., p. 7.)\u00a0\u00a0 So it is clearly seen that the evident the parties was that the owners of the lot should not gain any partnership the building except in the.event of a fire, if they contributed their share fire insurance policy, and that their share of joint ownership sh6uld be proportionate to the amount of their share in such insurance, not-withstanding\u00a0 which amount they should not be entitled to any of the profits nor bear any of the losses derived from the building.\u00a0 No fact nor datum whatever is available to show whether they did or did\u00a0 not gain a partners in the building, for the evidence was not forwarded with the bill of exceptions, nor does the latter contain an\u00a0 insertion of the \"preceding\" clause, mentioned the above\u00a0 quotation, whereby,\u00a0 apparently, it was covenanted what part of the value of the insurance was to pertain to the owners of the land.\u00a0 Be t as it may, what is certain and settled is that this special law of the con parties dispels the idea that they may be joint owners from the beginning, instead of from the time of the occurrence of a fire, and that even in the latter event they would be joint owners only for the purposes of reconstruction or repairs, with no power on the part of the owner of the ground to take away from the owner of\u00a0 the\u00a0 building the slightest amount of his profits. Wherefore, it would be extremely inconsistent, in this same case, to allow owner of the building to reduce, and by so much as one-half, the profits belonging to the owner of the ground.<\/p><p>On the\u00a0 hypothesis that these profits are so\u00a0 great\u00a0 as to render the contract truly\u00a0 one-sided,\u00a0 in the first place, it ought not to have been for it was not imposed upon the lessee, and in the second, the latter is n entitled under color\u00a0 of compensation and on his own authority to make a reduction\u00a0 in the rents,\u00a0 but this is for the courts to do, through due le action, should there be warrant of law, as in the case (if it may be a comparison) of a \"superficiary\" whose income is insufficient, through a pa destruction of the\u00a0 building erected,\u00a0 to pay the\u00a0 annuity.<\/p><p>Neither for the sole error assigned, nor under any of the other points o brought out by the ample discussion accorded\u00a0 this case, can this appeal meet with success.<\/p><p>The judgment appealed from is affirmed,\u00a0 with the costs of this instance against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<\/p><p><em>Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson,<\/em> and <em>Trent, JJ.<\/em>, concur.<\/p><\/div>",

URBANO BORLONGAN, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\"> Appeal by Urbano Borlongan from a judgment rendered by the Honorable Simplicio del Rosario.<br\/><br\/>On October 21, 1909, when the deputy provincial treasurer, Martin Allorde, was in the municipality of Obando, Province of Bulacan, examining the accounts of the municipal treasurer, Urbano Borlongan, he discovered a deficit of P114.42 in the funds in the municipal safe. When asked to explain the whereabouts of this sum, Borlongan submitted two vouchers, one for P16.65, his salary for half a month, and the other for P97.28, which he said he had paid to the municipal president, Sixto Joaquin, although the latter denied having received it. Both vouchers lacked the corresponding warrants of the municipal president, and were therefore rejected, with the result that, after overlooking the irregular application of the sum of P16.65, which he took from the safe as payment for his salary for 15 days in October, 1909, Borlongan was short, as municipal treasurer, the sum of P97.28, which appeared in voucher No. 5 as having been paid to the municipal president, without proof thereof.<br\/><br\/>An information was accordingly filed in the Court of First Instance by the provincial fiscal of said province on January 7, 1910, charging Urbano Borlongan with the crime of malversation of public funds. After trial thereon, the court rendered judgment on October 8 of the same year, sentencing the defendant to the penalty of six months imprisonment and costs, and ordering him to turn over to the then municipal treasurer the sums of P97.28 and P17.42, which form part of the funds of the municipal treasury, without prejudice to payment to the defendant of his unpaid salary for the time he discharged his duties, and to the municipal president the sum called for in vouchers Nos. 4 and 5. From this judgment the defendant appealed.<br\/><br\/>The municipal council by resolution at its meeting of August 4, 1909, authorized the payment to Sixto Joaquin, municipal president, of the sum of P97.28, as reimbursement for expenditures made by him, so the question at bar is reduced to whether the bill of the same date, stating the amount and signed by the creditor, Sixto Joaquin, was or was not paid to him by the defendant, Urbano Borlongan, municipal treasurer of that pueblo.<br\/><br\/>The latter avers that he paid said amount to the president Joaquin, although such payment does not appear on the balance sheet of that treasury made out on August 8, nor does it appear that the corresponding warrant for its payment was issued by said municipal president, who on his part avers that he did not collect said amount, but that he presented the bill to the accused treasurer with the voucher for its payment.<br\/><br\/>It appears from the trial that, according to the president Sixto Joaquin, the accused Borlongan owed him P200, delivered in two installments of P100 each, on different dates. This averment was corrected by the defendant, who said that he only owed the president Joaquin P197.28, of which amount he had received, one day in the month of February, 1909, P100 as a loan on the occasion of his marriage, and that in the latter part of the succeeding July he had asked for another loan, which Joaquin promised to let him have in a few days. So, on August 4, the president Joaquin presented to him the said bill for P97.28 with his vouchers for its payment, and half an hour after he had taken from the safe the amount of the bill and paid it to Joaquin, the latter again came downstairs from the president's office to the treasury, situated on the lower floor of the building, and gave him as a loan the same sum which half an hour before he had collected from the municipal treasury, and therefore with the aforementioned P100 he owed him P197.28.<br\/><br\/>The president, Joaquin, had been getting from him on account by means of signed acknowledgments sums that amounted to P188, as he (Borlongan) remembers, so that he only owed him a balance of P9. In proof of the authenticity of these vales, or acknowledgments, issued by his creditor, the latter executed in his favor a document in Tagalog, which was not impugned by the prosecution and which, translated, reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"I, Sixto Joaquin, married, native and resident of Obando, hereby declare and affirm that I have issued various receipts in my own hand-writing and signed with my name, the total amounts expressed in which I have received from Urbano Borlongan; and whenever he submits to me an itemized statement of said receipts, the total thereof shall be deducted from what he owes me, which is P197.28. \u2014 In witness whereof, I sign herewith, this 15th day of October, 1909. \u2014 (Sgd.) Sixto Joaquin.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In order to establish the crime of malversation of public funds in the present case, it is necessary to prove that the accused Borlongan appropriated to his own use and benefit the sum of P97.28, which was missing from the safe of the municipal treasury in his charge, and that he did not deliver it to the municipal president Sixto Joaquin as payment for said bill, according to resolution of the municipal council. The failure to issue a warrant for the payment was an error in administrative procedure, just as it was an inaeurracy or irregularity to make the application the defendant did of the sum of P16.65 in payment of his own salary for half the month of October, although he had a right to collect his salary.<br\/><br\/>If it is true, as appears from the proceedings, especially from the document in Tagalog written by the creditor Sixto Joaquin, that the accused only owed the latter P197.28 \u2014 that is, P100 received from him in February, 1909, and P97.28 more received from him on August 4 of the same year \u2014 and as long as the case does not disclose sufficient evidence that the defendant received from his creditor Joaquin another P100, instead of P97.28, in such manner that the total of the amounts owed reaches P200, it is imperative to recognize and admit the defendant's allegation that the president Joaquin received said P97.28, which sum he immediately turned over to the defendant as a loan. It is therefore indisputable that the defendant Borlongan withdrew this sum from the treasury in a lawful manner in order to pay the creditor who received it, and accordingly he did not commit the crime of malversation with which he is charged.<br\/><br\/>To show that the defendant Borlongan received from him two sums of P100 each on different dates, the president, Joaquin, avers in his testimony that he received, as payments from his debtor Borlongan on two occasions, the sum of P2.72, without issuing any receipt for so small a sum; but the defendant denies that he received the last P100, or that he paid this or any other sum to his creditor without a receipt, for Joaquin himself one day said to him that, in order to avoid confusion in his debt, it were better that receipts be issued for the sums paid on account, just as has creditor did in fact issue the receipts on pages 64 and 86, for various sums which he had paid on his debt of P197.28, as stated in the document in Tagalog above quoted. It is indeed peculiar that when the defendant took care not to pay any sum on account to his creditor that he should have given the latter P2.72, without taking any receipt, as he had been doing for the various sums received by Sixto Joaquin; from which fact, and others appearing in the case, it is inferred that the debt was not for P200 but for P197.28. It further appears, on page 108 of the record, that the defendant at the beginning of the trial deposited the sums alleged to be misappropriated, without prejudice to his right over them.<br\/><br\/>According to section 57 of General Orders, No. 58, a defendant in a criminal action shall be presumed to be innocent until the contrary is proved, and in case of a reasonable doubt that his guilt is satisfactorily shown he shall be entitled to an acquittal.<br\/><br\/>The case does not furnish satisfactory or conclusive proof beyond all reasonable doubt of the guilt of the defendant, and even were his innocence doubtful, there is still insufficient basis for an adverse judgment, and he is therefore entitled to acquittal of the charge.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, it is our opinion that the judgment should be reversed and Urbano Borlongan be and is hereby acquitted, with the costs in both instances <i>de oficio<\/i>. The sum deposited will be returned to him, without prejudice to Sixto Joaquin's right to collect the amount said Borlongan still owes him.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

that, the work of reconstruction was\u00a0 begun of the house on\u00a0 Calle Escolta,\u00a0 which had been destroyed\u00a0 by an earthquake, which work was not finished until 1903 and required an expenditure on the\u00a0 part of the defendant Ma- tilde Ortiz, of 5,091.52 pesos;

that the plaintiffs\u00a0 were obliged to pay to the administrator\u00a0 of said property the remuneration allowed him by law; that, as the revenues collected by the defendants amounted\u00a0 to no\u00a0 more\u00a0 than P3,654.15,\u00a0\u00a0 and the\u00a0 expenditures\u00a0 incurred\u00a0 by\u00a0 them, to P6,252.32, it followed that the plaintiffs owed\u00a0 the defendants Pl,299.08, that is, one-half of the different between the amount collected from and that expended on the\u00a0 properties, and\u00a0 asked that judgment be therefore rendered in their\u00a0 behalf to enable them to\u00a0 collect\u00a0 this sum from the plaintiffs, Ricardo\u00a0 Pardell and Vice Ortiz,\u00a0 with\u00a0 legal interest thereon from December 7, 1904, the date when accounts were rendered, together with\u00a0 the sums to which the defendant Bartolome was entitled for the administration of the undivided properties question.<\/p><p>By a written motion of August 21, 1905, counsel for the plaintiffs request permission to amend the complaint by inserting immediately after the\u00a0 wor \"or respective\u00a0 appraisal,\" fifth line of paragraph\u00a0 5, the phrase \"in ca accordance with the assessed value,\" and likewise further to amend the sa in paragraph 6 thereof, by substituting the following\u00a0 words in lieu of t petition for the remedy sought:\u00a0 \"By reason of all the foregoing, I beg t court to be\u00a0 pleased to render judgment by sentencing the\u00a0 defendants, Gaspar de Bartolome and Matilde Ortiz Felin de Bartolome, to restore and deliver to the plaintiffs an\u00a0 exact one-half of the total value of\u00a0 the undivided\u00a0 properties described in the complaint, such value to be ascertained by the expert appraisal of two competent persons, one of whom shall be appointed by the\u00a0 plaintiffs and\u00a0 the other by\u00a0 the defendants, and, in c of disagreement between these two appointees such value shall be determine by a third expert appraiser appointed by the court, or, in a proper case, the price offered at public auction;

that the properties retained by the defendants were valued at P9,310, and those retained by t plaintiffs, at P2,885, one-half\u00a0 of which amounts each party had\u00a0 to deli to the other, as they were <em>pro indiviso<\/em> properties; that, therefor defendants had to pay the plaintiffs the sum of P3,212.50, after deducting the amount which\u00a0 the plaintiffs were obliged to deliver to the defendant one- half of the price of the properties retained by the former; that, notwithstanding that the\u00a0 amount of the counterclaim for the expenses incurred in the\u00a0 reconstruction of the <em>pro indiviso <\/em>property should deducted from the sum which the defendants\u00a0 had\u00a0 to pay\u00a0 the plaintiffs, the\u00a0 former, for the purpose of\u00a0 bringing the matter\u00a0 of the partition to close, would deliver to the latter, immediately\u00a0 upon the signing of the instrument of purchase and\u00a0 sale, the sum\u00a0 of P3,212.50, which was\u00a0 one-h the value of the properties alloted to\u00a0 the defendants; such delivery, ho was not to be understood as a renouncement of the said counter-claim, but only as a\u00a0 means for the final termination\u00a0 of the <em>pro indiviso<\/em> is the property.<\/p><p>The case having\u00a0 been\u00a0 heard, the\u00a0 court, on October\u00a0 5, 1907, rendered judgment holding that the revenues and the expenses were compensated by the residence enjoyed by the defendant party, that no\u00a0 losses or damages were either caused or suffered, nor likewise any other expense besides the aforementioned, and absolved the defendants from the complaint and the plaintiffs from the counterclaim, with no special finding as to costs.\u00a0 A exception was taken to this judgment\u00a0 by counsel for\u00a0 the defendants who moved for a new trial on the grounds that the evidence presented did not warrant the judgment rendered and that the latter was contrary to law.\u00a0 T motion\u00a0 was denied, exception whereto was taken by said counsel, who file the proper bill of exceptions,\u00a0 and the same was\u00a0 approved\u00a0 and forwarded to the clerk of this court, with a transcript of the evidence.<\/p><p>Both of the litigating sisters assented to a partition by halves of\u00a0 the property left in her will by their mother at her death; in fact,\u00a0 during course of this suit, proceedings were had, in accordance with the agreements made, for the division between them\u00a0 of the said\u00a0 hereditary property of common ownership, which\u00a0 division\u00a0 was recognized\u00a0 and approved in the findings of the trial court, as shown by the judgment\u00a0 appealed\u00a0 from.<\/p><p>The issues\u00a0 raised by the parties, aside from said division made during t and which have been submitted to this court\u00a0 for decision, concern:\u00a0 (1) indemnity claimed for losses\u00a0 and damages, which the plaintiffs allege am to P8,000, in\u00a0 addition to the rents which should have been derived from house on Calle Escolta, Vigan;\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 the payment by the plaintiffs to the defendants of the sum of Pl,299.08, demanded by way of counterclaim, together with legal\u00a0 interest thereon from\u00a0 December 7,\u00a0 1904;\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 the payment to the husband of the defendant Matilde\u00a0 Ortiz, of a percentage claimed\u00a0 to be\u00a0 due him as the administrator of the property of common ownership; (4) the division of certain jewelry\u00a0 in the possession of the Vicenta Ortiz; and (5)\u00a0 the petition that the amendment be held to have been improperly admitted, which was\u00a0 made by\u00a0 the plaintiffs in their wri motion of August 21,1905, against the opposition of the defendants, through which admission the latter were obliged to pay the former P910.50.<\/p><p>Before entering upon an explanation of the propriety or impropriety of the claims made by both parties, it is indispensable to state that the trial in absolving the defendants from the complaint, held that they had not caused losses and damages to\u00a0 the plaintiffs, and that the revenues and expenses were compensated, in\u00a0 view of the fact that the defendants\u00a0 had been living\u00a0 for several years in the Calle Escolta house, which was\u00a0 <em> indiviso<\/em> property of joint ownership.<\/p><p>By this finding absolving the defendants from the complaint, and which wa acquiesced in by the plaintiffs\u00a0 who made no appeal\u00a0 therefrom, <em>the final issue has been\u00a0 decided<\/em> which was raised by the plaintiffs, concerning indemnity for losses and damages, wherein are\u00a0 comprised the rents which should have been obtained from the upper\u00a0 story of the said house during the time it was occupied by the defendants, Matilde Ortiz and her husband Gaspar de Bartolome.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding the acquiescence on the part of the plaintiffs, assenting the said finding whereby\u00a0 the defendants were absolved from the complaint yet,\u00a0 as such absolution is based on\u00a0 the compensation established in the judgment of the trial\u00a0 court,\u00a0 between\u00a0 the\u00a0 amounts which each party is entitled to claim from the other, it is imperative to determine whether t defendant Matilde Ortiz, as coowner of the house on Calle Escolta, was entitled, with her husband, to reside therein, without paying\u00a0 to her coo Vicenta Ortiz, who,\u00a0 during the greater part of the time, lived with her husband abroad, one-half of\u00a0 the rents which the upper story would have produced, had it been rented to a stranger.<\/p><p>Article 394 of the\u00a0 Civil Code prescribes:<\/p><p>\"Each co-owner may use the things owned in\u00a0 common, provided he uses them in\u00a0 accordance with their object\u00a0 and in such manner\u00a0 as not to injure\u00a0 t interests of the community\u00a0 nor prevent\u00a0 the co-owners from utilizing\u00a0 the according to their rights.\"<\/p><p>Matilde Ortiz and her husband occupied the upper story, designed for use a dwelling, in the house of joint ownership ; but the record shows no pro that, by so doing, the said Matilde occasioned any\u00a0 detriment\u00a0 to the int of the community property, nor that she prevented her sister Vicenta from utilizing the said upper story according to her rights.\u00a0\u00a0 It is to be not the stores of the lower floor were rented and an accounting of the rents duly made to the plaintiffs.<\/p><p>Each\u00a0 co-owner of realty held\u00a0 <em>pro indiviso<\/em>\u00a0 exercises his rights o whole property\u00a0 and may use and enjoy the same with no other limitation than that\u00a0 he\u00a0 shall not injure the interests of his co-owners, for\u00a0 the that, until a division be made, the respective part of each holder can no determined and every one of\u00a0 the co-owners exercises, together with his ot co-participants, joint\u00a0 ownership over the <em>pro indiviso<\/em> property, i to his use and enjoyment of the same.<\/p><p>As the hereditary properties of the joint ownership of the two sisters, V Ortiz, plaintiff, and Matilde Ortiz, defendant, were situated in the Prov Ilocos Sur, and were in the care of the last named, assisted by her husbant while the plaintiff Vicenta with her husband\u00a0 was residing outside\u00a0 of the province the greater part\u00a0 of\u00a0 the time between\u00a0 1885 and 1905,\u00a0 when\u00a0 sh left\u00a0 these Islands\u00a0 for Spain, it\u00a0 is not at all strange that delays and difficulties should have attended the efforts made to collect the rents a proceeds from the property\u00a0 held in common and\u00a0 to obtain\u00a0 a partition\u00a0 o the\u00a0 latter, especially during several years when, owing to the insurrection country was in a turmoil; and for this reason,\u00a0 aside from that founded o the right\u00a0 of co-ownership of the defendants, who took upon themselves the administration and\u00a0 care\u00a0 of the properties of joint tenancy for purposes their\u00a0 preservation and improvement,\u00a0 these latter are\u00a0 not obliged to pa the plaintiff\u00a0 Vicenta one-half of the rents which\u00a0 might have b derived from the upper story of the said house on Calle Escolta and, much less because one of the living rooms and the storeroom thereof were used for the storage of some belongings\u00a0 and effects of common ownership between the litigants.\u00a0\u00a0 The defendant Matilde, therefore, in occupying w husband the upper floor of the said house, did not injure the interests o coowner, her sister Vicenta, nor did she prevent\u00a0 the latter\u00a0 from living but merely exercised a legitimate right pertaining\u00a0 to her as a coowner o property.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding the\u00a0 above statements relative\u00a0 to the joint-ownership\u00a0 r which entitled the defendants to live in the upper story of the said hous in view of the fact that the record\u00a0 shows it to have been proved that th defendant Matilde's husband,\u00a0 Gaspar de Bartolome, occupied for four year a room or a part of the lower floor of the same house on Calle Escolta, using it as an office for the justice of the peace,\u00a0 a position which he the capital of that province, strict justice requires that he pay his sis the plaintiff,\u00a0 one-half of the monthly rent which the said quarters could produced, had they been leased to another person.\u00a0 The amount of such monthly rental is fixed at P16 in accordance with the evidence shown in t record. This conclusion as to Bartolome's liability results from the fact as the husband of the defendant coowner of the property, he had\u00a0 no right to occupy and use gratuitously the said part of the lower\u00a0 floor of the house in question, where he lived with his wife, to the detriment of the Vicenta who did not receive one-half of the rent\u00a0 which those quarters co and should have produced, had they been occupied by a stranger, in the same manner that rent was obtained from the rooms on the lower floor that were used as stores.\u00a0 Therefore,\u00a0 the defendant Bartolome must pay t the plaintiff Vicenta P384, that is, one-half of P768, the total amount o the\u00a0 rents which should have been obtained during four years from the quarters occupied as an office by the justice\u00a0 of the peace of Vigan.<\/p><p>With respect to the second question submitted for decision to this court, relative to the payment of the sum demanded as a counterclaim, it was admitted and proved in the present case that, as a result of a serious earthquake on August 15, 1897, the said house on Calle Escolta was left i and uninhabitable, and that, for its reconstruction or repair, the defend had\u00a0 to expend the sum of P6,252.32.\u00a0 This expenditure, notwithstanding t it was impugned, during the trial, by\u00a0 the plaintiffs,\u00a0 was duly proved,b evidence presented by the defendants.\u00a0\u00a0 Evidence, unsuccessfully rebutted also introduced which proved that the rents produced by all the rural\u00a0 an urban\u00a0 properties of common ownership amounted, up to August 1, 1905, to the,sum of P3,654,15 which, being applied toward the cost of the repair w on the said house, leaves a balance of P2,598.17, the amount actually advanced by the defendants,\u00a0 for the rents collected by them were not sufficient for the termination of all\u00a0 the work undertaken on\u00a0 the said building, necessary for its complete\u00a0 repair and to replace it in a habit condition.\u00a0\u00a0 It is therefore lawful and just that the plaintiff Vicenta O was willing to sell to her sister Matilde for Pl,500, her share in the ho question, when it was in a ruinous state,\u00a0 should\u00a0 pay the defendants\u00a0 on half of the amount expended in the said repair work, since the building a reconstruction\u00a0 was worth P9,000,\u00a0 according to expert appraisal. Consequently, the counterclaim made by the defendants for the payment to them of the sum of P1,299.08, is a proper demand, though from this sum a reduction must be made of P384, the amount of one half of the rents which should have been collected for the use of the quarters occupied by the justice of the peace, the payment of which is incumbent upon the\u00a0 husband of the defendant Matilde, as aforesaid, and the balance remaining, P915.0 the amount which the plaintiff Vicenta must pay to the defendants.<\/p><p>The defendants claim\u00a0 to\u00a0 be entitled to the\u00a0 collection of legal interest the\u00a0 amount of the counterclaim,, from December 7, 1904.\u00a0\u00a0 This contention can not be sustained, in asmuch as, until this suit is finally decided, not be known whether the plaintiffs would or would not be obliged to pay any sum whatever in reimbursement of expenses incurred by the plaintiffs in the repair\u00a0 work on the\u00a0 said house on Calle Escolta, whether not the defendants, in turn, were entitled to collect any such amount, an finally, what the net sum would be which the plaintiffs might have to pay reimbursement for one-half of the expenditure made by the defendants.\u00a0 Until final disposal of the case, no such net sum can be determined, nor until can the debtor be deemed to be in arrears.\u00a0 In order that there be an obligation to pay legal interest in connection\u00a0 with\u00a0 a matter at issue b the parties, it must be declared in a judicial decision from what date the interest will be due on the principal concerned\u00a0 in the suit.\u00a0 This\u00a0 rule established by the decisions of the supreme court of Spain, in reference articles 1108,\u00a0 1109, and\u00a0 1110 of the Civil Code, rendered on April\u00a0 24, November 19, 1869, and February 22, 1901.<\/p><p>With regard to the percentage, as remuneration claimed by the husband\u00a0 of the defendant Matilde for his administration of the property of common ownership, inasmuch as no stipulation whatever\u00a0 was\u00a0 made in the matter b and between him and his sister-in-law, the said defendant, the claimant i entitled to the payment of any remuneration whatsoever.\u00a0 Of his own accordance and as an officious manager, he administered the said <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">pro indiviso<\/span> proper one-half, of which belonged to his wife who held it in joint tenancy, wit sister-in-law, and the law does not allow him any compensation\u00a0 as such voluntary administrator.\u00a0\u00a0 He is merely entitled to\u00a0 a reimbursement for actual and necessary expenditures as he may have made on the undivided properties and an indemnity for the damages he may have\u00a0 suffered while acting in that capacity, since at all events\u00a0 it was\u00a0 his duty to care for preserve the said property, half\u00a0 of which belonged to his wife; and in exchange for the trouble and labor occasioned him by the\u00a0 administration his sister-in-law's half of the said property, he with his wife resided upper story of the house aforementioned, without payment of one-half of the rents said quarters might have produced had they been leased to another person.<\/p><p>With\u00a0 respect to the division of certain jewelry, petitioned for by the defendants and appellants only in their brief in this appeal, the record proceedings in the lower court does\u00a0 not show that\u00a0 the allegation made b the\u00a0 plaintiff Vicenta is not true, to the effect that the deceased mother the litigant sisters disposed of this jewelry during her lifetime,\u00a0 becau not done\u00a0 so, the will made\u00a0 by the said deceased would have been exhibited in which them said jewelry\u00a0 would have been mentioned, at\u00a0 leas would have been proved that the\u00a0 articles in question came into the possession of the plaintiff Vicenta without the expressed desire and the consent of the\u00a0 deceased mother of the said sisters, for the gift of\u00a0 thi jewelry was previously assailed\u00a0 in the courts, without success;\u00a0 therefor in view of\u00a0 its inconsiderable value, there is no\u00a0 reason for holding\u00a0 th said gift was not made.<\/p><p>As regards the collection of\u00a0 the sum of P910.50,\u00a0 which is the difference between the assessed value of the undivided real properties and the price the same as determined by the judicial expert appraiser, it is shown by t record\u00a0 that the ruling of\u00a0 the trial judge admitting the amendment to the original complaint,\u00a0 is in accord\u00a0 with the law and principles of justice reason that any of the coowners of a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">pro indiviso\u00a0<\/span> property, subject to division or sale, is entitled to petition for its valuation by competent appraisers. Such valuation is not prejudicial to any of the joint owners, beneficial to their interests,\u00a0 considering\u00a0 that, as a general rule, the value\u00a0 of a building or a parcel of realty\u00a0 is less than the actual real of the property,\u00a0 and this being understood by the defendants, they appointed an expert appraiser to determine,\u00a0 in conjunction with the\u00a0 one selected by the plaintiffs, the value of the properties of joint ownershi These two\u00a0 experts\u00a0 took part in the later proceedings of\u00a0 the\u00a0 suit unti finally, and during the course of\u00a0 the latter, the litigating parties agr amicable division of the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">pro indiviso<\/span> hereditary property, in accordance the price\u00a0 fixed by the\u00a0 judicial expert\u00a0 appraiser appointed as a third in\u00a0 view of the disagreement between and nonconformity of the appraisers chosen by the litigants.\u00a0 Therefore it is improper now to claim a right t collection\u00a0 of the\u00a0 said\u00a0 sum, the difference between the assessed value that\u00a0 fixed by\u00a0 the\u00a0 judicial\u00a0 expert appraiser, for the reason that the increase in price, as determined by this latter appraisal, redounded to t benefit of both parties.<\/p><p>In\u00a0 consideration of the foregoing,\u00a0 whereby the\u00a0 errors assigned to the court have been duly refuted, it is our opinion that, with a partial reversal the judgment appealed from, in so far as it absolves the plaintiffs from counterclaim presented by the defendants,\u00a0 we should\u00a0 and hereby do sentence the plaintiffs to the payment of the sum of P915.00,\u00a0 the balance of the sum claimed by the defendants as a balance of the one-half of the amount which the defendants advanced for the reconstruction or repair of the Calle Escolta house, after deducting from the total of such sum claim by the latter the amount of P384 which Gaspar de Bartolome,\u00a0 the husband of the defendant Matilde, should have paid as one-half of the rents due f his occupation of the quarters on the lower floor of the said house as an office for the justice of the peace court of Vigan; and we further find; That the defendants are not\u00a0 obliged to pay one-half of the rents\u00a0 which could\u00a0 have been obtained from the upper story of the said house; (2) tha the plaintiffs can not be compelled to pay legal interest from December 7 1904, on the\u00a0 sum expended in the reconstruction\u00a0 of the aforementioned house, but only the interest fixed by law, at the rate\u00a0 of\u00a0 6\u00a0 per cent per annum, from the\u00a0 date\u00a0 of the judgment to be rendered in accordance with this decision; (3) that the husband of the defendant Matilde\u00a0 Ortiz is no entitled to any remuneration for the administration of the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">pro indiviso<\/span> property belonging to both parties;\u00a0 (4) that, neither is he entitled to collect f plaintiffs the sum of P910.50, the difference between the assessed valuation and the price set by the\u00a0 expert appraisal solicited\u00a0 by the plaintiffs amendment\u00a0 to the complaint; and,\u00a0 (5) that\u00a0 no partition shall be made certain jewelry aforementioned now in the possession of the\u00a0 plaintiff Vi Ortiz.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 said\u00a0 judgment,\u00a0 as relates to the\u00a0 points\u00a0 appealed,\u00a0 is affirmed, in so far\u00a0 as its findings agree with those of this decision, a reversed, in so far as they do not.\u00a0 No\u00a0 special\u00a0 finding\u00a0 is made regard the costs of both instances.\u00a0 So ordered.<\/p><p><em> Arellano, C.

that at the request of the plaintiffs an order was issued November 8 of the same year declaring the defendant in default from nonappearance and setting the 12th of the same month for the new hearing still the defendant Smith failed to appear, wherefore the justice of the on November 13 rendered the judgment, nullification whereof is sought, i favor of the defendants, ordering that the defendant Smith vacate the property rented\u00a0 and sentencing him to the payment of P4,000 as rent and damages,\u00a0 and the costs.\u00a0 Since the defendant did not\u00a0 appeal from this judgment, the sheriff, at\u00a0 the request of the plaintiffs, proceeded to l upon his property, which was turned over to the plaintiff Mijares.<\/p><p>In explanation of the reasons why he failed to appear in that suit tried the justice of the peace\u00a0 court and to answer the\u00a0 complaint\u00a0 of the married\u00a0 couple\u00a0 Mijares\u00a0 and Montilla, Mr.\u00a0 Smith, the defendant, state affidavit made in the present suit before the Court of First Instance th when he received in Iloilo, where he resided, notice and summons as a re of said complaint filed in the justice of the peace court of Binalbagan September, 1909, he went one day in the following October to the said to of Occidental Negros to answer it, but he\u00a0 found no one in the\u00a0 justice the peace court of said town, and though he found in the municipal build the municipal secretary, the latter refused to deal with him, and that October 21 he\u00a0 was away from the Islands and was probably in\u00a0 Hongkong or Formosa when the judgment was rendered, having returned to these Islands and his home in Iloilo on the\u00a0 10th or 12th of January, 1910, and about middle of February received notice that the case had been decided against him by default.<\/p><p>In view of these facts and\u00a0 the allegations and evidence adduced by the parties, the Court of First Instance held that the plaintiff Smith through accident, mistake, or excusable negligence could not appeal from the judgment of the\u00a0 said justice of the peace, and therefore came\u00a0 within the purview of section 148 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and exercising the discretion authorized by that section set aside the said judgment and direction that the defendants institute a\u00a0 new suit in the Court of First Instance same points covered by their claim against the lessee Smith, in order that they might be discussed and decided on their genuine merits.<\/p><p>Said claim of the defendants arises from a contract of lease entered int between them and\u00a0 the plaintiff Smith, which was reduced to writing and certified copy thereof exhibited at the trial in the justice of the peace court, forming a part of said defendants Exhibit A.<\/p><p>Said claim of the defendants Mijares and Montilla\u00a0 seeks collection of t sum of P4,000 as rent and damages for non-fulfillment of\u00a0 said contract, and from the nature of the rights of action derived from that claim and complex questions arising from a contract of lease\u00a0 in the terms it was out, the incompetence of a justice of the peace to hear and pass upon them under the law clearly appears.<\/p><p>In the judgment appealed from it is averred that if this judgment be all to stand, as it was rendered by the justice of the peace, it would tolerate injustice because of the large amount of\u00a0 damages awarded, for\u00a0 there was no evidence upon which the justice of the peace could base his judgment P4,000 damages for non-fulfillment of contract.<\/p><p>This judicial finding more fully demonstrates the incompetence of the justice the peace regarding certain points in the complaint\u00a0 filed before him an propriety of the judgment appealed from.<\/p><p>Nevertheless, this judgment is not in itself a matter for appeal, because setting aside the judgment of the justice of the peace the\u00a0 court\u00a0 did n finally\u00a0 decide the case but directed the appellants to institute a new the Court of First Instance, and against the judgment that might then be rendered said\u00a0 appellants might appeal to\u00a0 this court for decision in se instance.\u00a0 Therefore, said appeal was improperly allowed through a bill exceptions because it dealt with a decision that was not in its nature For the\u00a0 foregoing\u00a0 reasons, we hold that\u00a0 the appeal in question\u00a0 was improperly\u00a0 allowed and direct that the case be returned to the Court of First Instance, with a certified copy of this decision, for compliance w rendered in the Court of First Instance on February 11, 1911.<\/p><p><em>Arellano, C.

It is admitted that the business in w Ang Kah Lian was a partner went into bankruptcy about a year before his return.\u00a0\u00a0 (January 6, 1911.)\u00a0 It is not\u00a0 denied that the records of the o the Collector of Customs\u00a0 show that on\u00a0 or\u00a0 about the 7th of\u00a0 February, 1905,\u00a0 the\u00a0 Collector of Customs of the Philippine Islands had indorsed A Kah Lian as a resident Chinese merchant\u00a0 of the Philippine\u00a0 Islands,\u00a0 doing business at 139 Calle\u00a0 Nueva,\u00a0 in the city of Manila.\u00a0 The records of\u00a0 th office of the Collector of Customs also show that Ang Kah Lian returned the\u00a0 Philippine\u00a0 Islands and was admitted\u00a0 as a resident Chinese merchant or about the 3d of October, 1907.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 records of the\u00a0 office of the Collector of Customs further\u00a0 show that after an investigation, a merchants certificate\u00a0 had\u00a0 been issued\u00a0 to Ang Kah Lian\u00a0 on\u00a0 January 22, 1907, and that at that time he was a partner\u00a0 in an importation of silk and dry-goo business, at 139 Calle\u00a0 Nueva, in\u00a0 the city of Manila, under the firm\u00a0 name Ang Ban-Ka, the\u00a0 capital of which was P85,000, and that the interest of Ang Kah\u00a0 Lian in said business was P15,000.<p>Upon the foregoing\u00a0 facts the board\u00a0 of\u00a0 special\u00a0 inquiry denied\u00a0 Ang Kah Lian the\u00a0 right to enter the Philippine Islands\u00a0 as a resident Chinese me upon the\u00a0 ground that the mercantile business\u00a0 in which he had been engage did not exist at the time of\u00a0 his return.<\/p><p>From that decision of the board\u00a0 of special inquiry,\u00a0 an appeal\u00a0 was take to the Collector\u00a0 of\u00a0 Customs, where the same was affirmed.<\/p><p>Later the applicant presented\u00a0 a petition for the\u00a0 writ of habeas\u00a0 corpus the\u00a0 Court of First Instance\u00a0 of\u00a0 the city of Manila.\u00a0 After a due consideration of the facts,\u00a0 the Honorable A.

Rep., 294.)<\/p><p>The <em>pacto de retro,<\/em> the right to repurchase and the obligation to\u00a0 sell back to the vendor, does not accord with the contract of mortgage which is usually made for the purpose of guaranteeing the fulfillment of a principal obligation, nor can it be deemed\u00a0 to be subject to stipulations inherent in a mortgage or connected therewith.\u00a0\u00a0 A creditor\u00a0 can not appropriate to himself the things or real property given in mortgage, nor dispose of them\u00a0 (arts. 1857 and 1859, Civil Code); while a purchaser under a <em>pacto de retro,<\/em>\u00a0 as soon as, rights of dominion are consolidated as prescribed by law, may\u00a0 dispose of the same as their absolute owner and without restriction.<\/p><p>Moreover, aside from\u00a0 the statements Above made with reference to the contents of the document aforementioned, page\u00a0 20 of the record, the\u00a0 said contract appears to have. been drawn up in a private instrument and as such is not susceptible of inscription in the registry of property, while, in order that a mortgage may be deemed to be legally constituted, it is indispensable that the\u00a0 instrument in which it appears be a public document and be\u00a0 recorded\u00a0 in\u00a0 the property register.\u00a0 Therefore, a mortgage in legal form was not constituted by the said private document.<\/p><p>Pursuant to the provisions of article 1278 of the Civil Code, contracts shall be binding, whatever may be the form in\u00a0 which\u00a0 they\u00a0 may\u00a0 have\u00a0 been\u00a0 executed,\u00a0 provided\u00a0 the essential conditions\u00a0 required for their\u00a0 validity exist, as prescribed in article 1261 of the code.<\/p><p>The agreement contained in the said instrument, according\u00a0 to\u00a0 the preinserted translation, is perfectly valid and effective, since it\u00a0 unites all\u00a0 the essential requisites of a legal contract, which are:\u00a0 the consent of the contracting parties, a definite object as the subject of the contract, and a consideration for the obligation; and such an agreement may be made in\u00a0 a private instrument, as the law does not require it to be set forth in a public document.<\/p><p>The said contract with right of repurchase was executed on\u00a0 May 23, 1897, since which date up\u00a0 to May 23,\u00a0 1910, when suit was filed, thirteen years elapsed.\u00a0 Article 1508 of the Civil Code prescribes:<\/p><p>\"The right referred to in the preceding article (1507), in the absence of an express agreement, shall last four years counted from the date of the contract.<\/p><p>\"Should\u00a0 there be\u00a0 an agreement,\u00a0 the period shall not exceed ten\u00a0 years.\"<\/p><p>The contract in question having been made after the said code came into force, since December, 1889, it\u00a0 is undeniable that the right to repurchase the land, On the part of the plaintiffs, has prescribed, inasmuch as the four years fixed by law, in\u00a0 the absence of an express agreement as in the present case, have more than elapsed, and, furthermore, the period of ten years has also elapsed; the maximum time\u00a0 the law allows\u00a0 when a term is stipulated between the contracting parties.\u00a0 The appellants,\u00a0 therefore, are not now entitled to claim, as they do, the right to redeem the land in\u00a0 question.\u00a0\u00a0 (Alano <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>. Babasa, 10 Phi.

Therefore,\u00a0 no legal or just\u00a0 reason exists whereby Ismael Goduco may be compelled to return the land by resale, nor for the annulment of the contract of sale executed by him, and Esteban Goduco,\u00a0 to whom was transmitted by the said Ismael Goduco\u00a0 the latter's lawful right acquired\u00a0 from the preceding owners of the land.<\/p><p>For the\u00a0 foregoing reasons,\u00a0 which\u00a0 refute the errors assigned to\u00a0 the judgment appealed from, it is our opinion that the said judgment should be as it is hereby affirmed, with the costs against the appellants.<\/p><p><em>Arellano,\u00a0 C.

Judgment having been rendered by the  court below, Honorable  Dionisio Chanco  presiding,  denying  the plaintiffs' right to recover for the value  of the  products, but  declaring  that they  are the  owners  and entitled  to the possession of said lands,  both parties appealed and presented separate bills  of exceptions; but  the  plaintiffs  now ask that the judgment appealed from be affirmed in all of its  parts, so it will not  be necessary to examine into the question of  the plaintiffs'  right to a judgment for the products of the  land.<\/p>\n<p>The plaintiffs base their title to the lands in dispute upon a purchase and sale made by their father, Vicente Andres Cam,  on  the 18th day of August, 1886, from Loreano Pimentel, father of the defendant Valeriana Pimentel, while, on the other hand, the defendant claims to have inherited these lands from her mother, Dona Ines Guerrero.  Both parties presented oral and documentary  evidence  for the purpose  of establishing their respective claims.<\/p>\n<p>One of the defenses interposed by the defendant is <em>res judicata<\/em>,  based upon a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Norte, wherein Angelo Andres et al. were plaintiffs and Domingo Caluya was defendant.  The question here presented is whether or not the judgment in that case is an adjudication of the subject-matter  in the  case at bar, so that it  can not be retried.<\/p>\n<p>The plaintiffs  in the former  case were Angelo Andres, Cenona Andres,  Eduvigis  Andres,  Venancio Andres, Alejandro Andres, Maria Reyes, Sotera Fondevilla, and Maria Andres;  and the defendant was Domingo Caluya.<\/p>\n<p>The plaintiffs  in  the present case are Angelo Andres, Cenona Andres,  Eduvigis  Andres,  Venancio Andres, Alejandro Andres, Maria Andres, Juan Andre's, Higino Andres, Margarita Andres, Maria Andres, and Pedro Andres; and the defendant is  Valeriana Pimentel.<\/p>\n<p>The subject-matters of the  actions are exactly the same in both  cases\u2014the  lands  in question.  The same documentary  material'evidence was presented by both  parties in both cases, but the record  does not disclose whether the oral testimony was the same or not.  The plaintiffs  in both cases as  appears from the evidence thus submitted claim ownership of the  lands in dispute by inheritance from their deceased parents, Vicente Andres Cam and Florentina Juan, and  that  their deceased father  acquired these lands  by purchase from  Loreano Pimentel, father of the defendant in the present case.  While on the other hand, the defendant in the former case alleged that said lands belonged to his mother-in-law, the defendant in this case, and  she, in the present case, claims  ownership of  these lands  by inheritance from her deceased mother, Ines Guerrero.   The judgment in the former case is the following:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p> \"LAOAG, <em>August 2, 1905<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>\"The plaintiffs claim the land described  in the complaint, alleging that the same belonged to their deceased parents.<\/p>\n<p>\"The defendant  opposes this claim on  the ground that the land in question  belongs to  his mother-in-law, Valeriana Pimentel.<\/p>\n<p>\"The plaintiffs and  the defendant respectively presented documents to show their alleged title to the lands.  It appears from the documents presented by plaintiffs that the ownership claimed  by  them is derived from an assignment or cession made by Laureano Pimentel in favor of their parents in payment of a debt, and the documents presented by defendant show that the  lands were  inherited by Valeriana Pimentel from her mother,  Ines Guerrero.<\/p>\n<p>\"It is necessary to first establish the title of the assignor, Laureano Pimentel, which is rebutted by the allegation and proof of ownership on the part of Valeriana Pimentel, in order that the assignment may not be considered prejudicial to the latter's  right, she not having been  a party  to  the said assignment or cession.   The  documents presented by the plaintiffs may be sufficient as between  them and Laureano Pimentel and his heirs, but  they are not binding upon a  third person who asserts a different right or title derived from that of the said Laureano.<\/p>\n<p>\"The  title in  the  assignor Laureano Pimentel not having been  duly  established  in this case, the allegations of the complaint are not sufficient, and the court  hereby absolves the defendant therefrom, with the costs  against the  plaintiffs.<\/p>\n<p>\"It is so ordered.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Counsel for the defendant, in discussing the question of <em>res judicata,<\/em> confine themselves to one point.  This point is stated by them in the following language:<\/p>\n<p>\"Both the preponderance of authority in this country, and the  weight of sound legal reason sustain the doctrine that the former judgment, if admissible under the general issue, is just as conclusive when so presented as if it had been specifically set up by a plea at bar.\"<\/p>\n<p>Let it be admitted  that this is the law upon  this point. Yet the question of res judicata is  not, by any means, disposed of, as it will be  seen  that the parties of record  in both actions are not exactly  the same, neither are the defendants the same.  But it  does appear that exactly the same material question was submitted to the court in both cases;  that is,  the ownership of  the  land.  While it  is difficult  to determine with absolute certainty the precise point upon which the  first judgment was based,  let us say, for the purpose of determining the question  of <em>res judicata<\/em> with reference to  the defendant  Valeriana  Pimentel, that the real question presented and determined in the former case was whether or not Laureano Pimentel  was the owner of these lands at the time he ceded them to the father of the plaintiffs, and that this  question was decided in the negative.  Valeriana Pimentel  was  not a party of record in that suit.  Her son-in-law  was the only defendant.   The record fails to disclose whether  or not she was present during the trial or took any part  whatever in  the same. The statement \"which is rebutted  by the allegations and proof of ownership on  the part of Valeriana  Pimentel\" might indicate  that she was present and  furnished  the proof, but this fact is not by any means clear.<\/p>\n<p>In the case of Tanguinlay vs. Quiros (10 Phil. Rep., 360), this court said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The law  of <em>res judicata <\/em>is  well settled  in the United States and is laid down in a series of decisions of the  Supreme Court  to the effect that as between the  parties to the first judgment and their privies it operates as a bar to a second action upon the same  claim, not only as to issues actually in litigation but also as to all matters which might have been litigated therein, whereas in an action between them upon a different  cause it is a bar only as to matters actually litigated.   (Cromwell <em>vs.<\/em> County of  Sac, 94 U. S., 351; Werlein <em>vs.<\/em> New Orleans, 177 U. S., 390; United States <em>vs.<\/em> California  Co., 192 U. S., 355; Fayerweather <em>vs.<\/em> Hitch, 195  U.  S., 276, 299; N, P. Railway Co. <em>vs.<\/em> Slaght,  205 U.S., 122.)\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The phrase  \"between  the parties  to the first judgment and their privies\" is not defined in that case, so we must look  to  other  authorities for the purpose  of  determining the meaning of the words \"parties and their privies\" when used in  this connection.<\/p>\n<p>The general rule is thus stated in  24 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. Law (2ded.), 724:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The  persons between whom the judgment  or decree in a suit is conclusive in a  subsequent suit are the parties to the prior suit  and their privies,  and  as a general rule it is conclusive only between them.  The mere fact that a person had an interest in the subject-matter of the prior suit will not render the  judgment or decree therein conclusive upon him.\"   (Citing in support of this rule a long list of cases.)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>It  is also stated in the same volume,  page 827, that:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Judgments in actions  or suits in personam are inter partes and  binding and  conclusive only upon the parties of record, and, in some instances, persons  who actually participate in  the litigation and their privies.<\/p>\n<p>\"It is a rule that estoppels must be  mutual; and therefore a party  will not be  concluded, against his contention, by a former judgment, unless he could have used it as a protection,  or as the foundation of  a claim had the judgment been the other way; and conversely no person  can claim the benefit of a judgment as an estoppel upon \"his adversary unless he would have been prejudiced by a contrary decision of the case.\"  (23 Cyc,  1238, and a  large number  of cases cited thereunder.)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Valeriana Pimentel, as we have said, the defendant in the present case, was not a defendant of record in the former  case.  This being true, would she have been bound by the judgment of the court had it  been against the contention  of her  son-in-law, Domingo Caluya, the  defendant in that  action?  In other words, if the court had declared in the former case that the lands in question  were the property of those plaintiffs, would Valeriana Pimentel have been bound by that judgment?  If so, then her defense of <em>res judicata<\/em> is well founded; but if not, then she cannot interpose  this  defense against the present plaintiffs.   As she was not a party of record in that case, and as the record in the  present case fails  to show that she was present and took part  in the former trial, we think that that judgment, had it  been in favor of the plaintiffs, would not be binding upon her.  Consequently, the judgment in  that case is not res judicata between  the parties in the present case.   The plaintiffs  appealed from  the judgment in the former case, but said  appeal was dismissed by  this court  for failure to prosecute.  We do not know why the plaintiffs failed to prosecute  their appeal unless  it be said that they knew that a judgment against the  defendant Domingo Caluya could not prejudice the  rights of Valeriana Pimentel,  and they therefore  decided to abandon that case  and institute new proceedings against the real  party, the defendant.   If the record had shown that Valeriana  Pimentel had full notice of the  pendency of the former suit and did in fact advise with the defendant as to the  plan  of the defense, the question might have been different.  Again, the former judgment could not be <em>res  judicata<\/em> against those plaintiffs in the present case who were not parties to the former.<\/p>\n<p>The  other questions raised relate to the probative force of the oral and documentary evidence presented by the parties.<\/p>\n<p>Counsel for the plaintiffs, on page 6 of his printed brief, says:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"We make this  assertion with  such  certainty and confidence that we hereby declare that our clients are agreeable and will  not object to the honorable court declaring the defendant owner of the lands to which the  witnesses of the latter refer, and which  are described in Exhibits AA and BB.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>If the lands in dispute are those described in defendant's documents, then said  lands must be the property  of the defendant, as the plaintiffs  lay no claim to the lands described in those documents.  While on the other hand, if the lands described in the complaint and  in  the  documents  of the plaintiffs are separate and distinct from  those described in the defendant's documents then said lands must necessarily be  the  property  of the plaintiffs,  as the defendant only claims title to the lands described in her documents.  It is necessary to examine the proof in order to determine these questions.<\/p>\n<p>Plaintiffs assert title to five parcels of  land, three within the municipality of Dingras and two within the municipality of  Laoag.  These lands,  according  to the  amended complaint, are described as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\" (<em>a<\/em>)  The first is located in the sitio of Santa Regina in the municipality of Dingras, Province of Ilocos Norte, P.

These three parcels are situated in the municipality of Dingras.  The other two parcels claimed by the plaintiffs are in the municipality of Laoag.  These lands being in different municipalities may  be the reason why they were not all included in the same  petition for a possessory title.<\/p>\n<p>The description of the lands in question  given by the plaintiffs in the case instituted in 1904 is exactly the same as that given  in the present case.  The location of  these lands as given  in these complaints is exactly the same as that given in Exhibit Q, the document of transfer from Loreano Pimentel to  the father  of the plaintiffs, but the descriptions are not exactly the  same, neither  are the perimeters.  The perimeters in the first are  given in meters, while in Exhibit Q they are given in brazas.   The perimeters in brazas reduced to meters show a difference which is not so very great. The names of  the landowners joining these parcels as given in the complaint are not exactly the same as those stated in Exhibit Q.   This discrepancy is necessarily due to changes in ownership of such lands since the year 1886.   Considering the oral testimony, together with the description of the lands given in  the complaint, in Exhibit Q, and in Exhibit R, it  is established by a  preponderance of  evidence  that the lands referred to in these  three documents are the same.<\/p>\n<p>As far as the parcels  in Dingras are concerned, it is impossible to reconcile the descriptions given in defendant's Exhibit AA with any of the descriptions.   There are four parcels described in this Exhibit AA, one in Santa Maria, one in San Agustin,  one in Santa Regina, and one in  San Jose.  The plaintiffs claim no lands in either Santa Maria, San Agustin, or San Jose.  While  some of the boundaries of the land in  Doro given in Exhibit BB coincide with the description of the lands claimed by  the  plaintiffs in that same sitio, nevertheless the record clearly establishes the fact that the plaintiffs and their parents were in possession of all the lands in question for more than ten years, or from the time the same were transferred to them in 1886 until they were  finally ousted about the year 1899 by the son-in-law of the defendant.   This son-in-law  illegally took possession of  these lands in that year in  violation of the judgment of the Court of First Instance in  a case wherein Florentina Juan was plaintiff and  Caluya was defendant. In this judgment, which was rendered August 5, 1895, the court directed Caluya to abstain from molesting Florentina Juan in the possession of these lands.<\/p>\n<p>We think, after a close examination of the entire record, that the judgment appealed from should be  affirmed, with costs against the appellant.   So ordered.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano,  C. J., Torres,  Mapa,  Johnson,  Carson,<\/em> and <em>Moreland,  JJ.,<\/em> concur.<\/p>\n<\/div>",

L, and  while he was president of the municipal board of health of the said pueblo, voluntarily, unlawfully and  criminally collect and receive P0.25 from one Marcos Paulete and P0.50 from one Crispulo  Masaya, as fees for the slaughter of animals in the said pueblo; but, to their prejudice did appropriate the said sums  to nis own use, without delivering the same to the municipal treasurer or returning them to the said Paulete and Masaya; acts in violation of law.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>In view of the evidence adduced at the  trial, the court sentenced the defendant to the penalty of two months and one day of <em>arresto mayor<\/em>, to reimburse each of the offended parties in the sum of twenty-five centavos,  and to the payment  of the  costs of the trial.  From this judgment the defendant appealed.<\/p>\n<p>At the trial the following facts were proved:  first, that on one occasion the defendant received from a person by the name of Crispulo Masaya, some pork, valued at 25 eentavos, under  the express obligation  of paying such sum,  in cash, to the  municipal treasurer of the pueblo as the fee for the slaughter of the  hog; second,  that, on another occasion, one Marcos Paulete delivered to the same defendant the sum of 25 centavos, in coin, with the instruction that he deliver it to the  municipal treasurer in payment of  the fee for the slaughter of a hog which  the said Paulete  had butchered; third, that the defendant did not deliver either  amount to the municipal treasurer, nor  return it to the said  Masaya and Paulete; and, fourth, that when these events occurred the defendant held the office  of president of the municipal board of health of the pueblo.<\/p>\n<p>In view of such facts we find the defendant guilty of the crime of <em>estafa,<\/em> provided for and punished by paragraph 5 of article 535 of the Penal Code, as regards  the twenty-five centavos he received in cash from Marcos  Paulete,  inasmuch as, having received them under the express instruction to  deliver them in the latter's name to the municipal treasurer in payment of the fee which the said Paulete owed for the slaughter of an animal,  he,  instead  of complying with such instruction, appropriated the said sum to his own use, to the manifest prejudice of the said Paulete who, of course,  would have again to expend,  if he has  not already done so, a like sum of 25 centavos to pay the fee referred to.  The title under which the defendant received the aforesaid sum was evidently that of a commission consisting in the before mentioned instruction to deliver the  same to the municipal treasurer; and the fraudulent  appropriation of money received on commission is one of the acts expressly mentioned in the aforecited legal provision as constituting the crime of <em>estafa<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>With respect to the 25 centavos, the value of the pork received from Crispulo Masaya, we are of opinion that the herein defendant did not commit the crime of <em>estafa.<\/em>  In the first place  it is not claimed,  nor certainly  could it be claimed, that he  embezzled the meat itself as  such, since he acquired  it lawfully through Masaya's own free will and consent.  The latter delivered it to  him  in order that  he might own  it and do with  it as  he saw  fit.   The title of acquisition of the meat was, therefore, on the  part  of the defendant,  absolute  and perfect  and excludes  all idea of fraudulent appropriation of the same.  Neither was there any such fraudulent appropriation of the twenty-five centavos stipulated between the defendant  and Masaya  as the price  of the said meat,  because  one can not very well fraudulently appropriate to himself money that is his own, and these 25  centavos  which the defendant assumed the obligation to pay as the value of that meat were  unquestionably his so long as they had not gone  out of his possession. He did not receive from Masaya the said sum nor any other, in cash; what he did receive from the latter, was a small amount of meat, and that, with the understanding perfectly known to and agreed upon between them both that he received it for himself, that is to say, to make it lawfully his own and to convert it to such  uses as might best suit him, and not  for the purpose of keeping it at the disposal of Masaya or of delivering it to a third person.  The 25 centavos which he agreed to deliver to the municipal treasurer, for Masaya, were  never received by him from the latter, nor did they ever belong to the said Masaya, notwithstanding that the latter was entitled to collect them from the defendant as the value of the meat which Masaya delivered or sold to him.<\/p>\n<p>It follows, therefore, that what the defendant bound himself to deliver to the municipal treasurer was something entirely distinct from the thing he received from Masaya, as indeed is an amount of meat from a sum of money in cash.  This being so, there is evidently  lacking one of the essential requisites of the crime  of  estafa, as defined  in paragraph 5 of article 535 of the  Penal  Code.   An oftconsulted author, in commenting on this legal provision, says literally, in part, as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The third element of this crime consists  in  that the things mentioned (money, goods or any other chattel) shall have been received as a deposit, on commission or for administration, or under any other title from which  arises the obligation to deliver them or  return them, that is, to deliver or return the same thing received (not another of the same kind and quality), as occurs in the case of the deposit, commission and administration of which this article particularly treats, and also, for example, in the contract of comodato where the borrower is obliged to make restitution of or to return the very same thing  which, he received for a specific use.\"   (Viada, Penal Code, amended, vol. 3, p.  515.)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Frankly, with regard to this feature of the case, there was simply a sale of meat by Masaya to the defendant, the price of which,  25 centavos, the latter agreed to deliver to the municipal treasurer, instead of to Masaya himself; and it does not appear that there can be any question as to the fact that the mere noncompliance on the part of the purchaser, with his obligation to pay the price of the sale, is, nor can  be in any manner whatsoever, in  accordance with the Penal Code, an essential element of the crime of <em>estafa<\/em> in any of the various forms in which it may be committed. The fact that the payment was to be made, pursuant to the agreement, to a person other than the vendor, and not to the latter himself, has no bearing whatever on the point. The obligation of the purchaser in both cases is exactly the same in  substance, is of a purely civil nature, and noncompliance therewith can, similarly, only give rise to the exercise of a civil action.<\/p>\n<p>The penalty of two months and one day of <em>arresto mayor,<\/em> imposed upon the defendant by the judgment appealed from, is in  accordance with the law, as regards the sum of 25 centavos swindled from Marcos Paulete, even  allowing no weight, as none should be allowed, to the matter of the other sum of 25 centavos,  the value of the  meat delivered to  the defendant by Crfspulo Masaya, for the reason already indicated above,  to wit, that, with respect thereto,  no crime of estafa was committed.  It is  maintained in the Attorney-General's brief that the defendant committed that crime, not as a private  person,  but as  a public official in his capacity of president of the  municipal board of health, and that, therefore, there  should in addition be imposed upon him the penalty prescribed in article 399 of the  Penal Code, as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The public official who,  taking advantage of his office, shall  commit any  of the  crimes  specified  in Chapter IV, Section II, Title XIII of this book, shall incur in addition to the penalties  prescribed therein that of temporary disqualification  in  its maximum degree to perpetual special disqualification.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>This article is not applicable to all the embezzlements and swindles or estafas which a public official might commit, but only to such as he may commit by taking advantage of his office, as the text thereof expressly says.  The office of president of the municipal board of health, which the defendant held, has nothing to do with the collection of license fees for the slaughter of animals, which fees must be paid like all the taxes and other revenues of the municipality, to the provincial or municipal treasurer, pursuant to section 69 of Act No. 82.   Marcos Paulete himself well knew this on delivering the 25  centavos to the defendant  with the explicit direction  that the latter should deliver it to the municipal treasurer of his pueblo as the fee for the slaughter of an  animal.  He,  therefore,  knew that this money was delivered to him, not in his official capacity, but as a private party, in the same manner as might have been done to any other person not a public official, since it did not matter at all whether or not the person who should pay, in Paulete's name,  the  said fees to the municipal treasurer, was such. The defendant, then, not having acted  as president of the municipal  board  of  health,  but as  a  private citizen,  in receiving that sum, evidently did not take advantage of his office, and  therefore,  the provisions  of the said article 399 are not applicable, and the swindle or estafa committed by him must be punished only by the penalty specified in paragraph 5 of article  535, in connection  with article  534, which, in fact, is the one imposed upon him in the judgment appealed from.   (8 Phi], Rep., 589,<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> and 9 Phil. Rep., 84.<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup>)<\/p>\n<p>The defense  alleges that  the  Court  of  First  Instance which  pronounced judgment in this cause lacked  jurisdiction to try the same, and that, consequently, all the proceedings had therein are  null and void, inasmuch as the crime concerned is one for which the law fixes a  penalty of less than six months' imprisonment, the trial  of which  class of crimes pertains solely and  exclusively, in first instance, to the courts of the justice of the peace, according to section    68 of Act No. 136, providing for the organization of courts in the Philippine Islands.<\/p>\n<p>Certain it is that the penalty fixed by law for the crime which was proven in the trial of this case, is less than six months  imprisonment, and that the justices of the peace have  original jurisdiction for the trial of all misdemeanors and offenses in all cases where the sentence might not by law exceed six months' imprisonment or a fine of one hundred dollars; but it is no less certain that the complaint in the case at bar was  filed, not  for the said crime  exactly, but for another more serious one, which is that of estafa committed by a public official,  since, according to  the language thereof, it was  committed by the accused as president of the municipal board of health.   The crime charged under such  form  of  complaint  is  punishable by  law with the penalty of temporary special disqualification  in its maximum degree to perpetual special disqualification,  in addition to  the penalties  prescribed in the section that treats of swindles and other false pretenses  (art. 399, Penal Code). The said penalty of disqualification is considered by the law as  a  punishment, and in itself fixes the measure of its gravity.   It is severer, under such classification, than those of presidio and prisidn correctional, which, as is known, are from six months and one day to six years' duration and, as indicated by their name itself, are classified only as correctional penalties (art. 25).  And,if to this it is added that, pursuant to article 6, crimes are considered \"graves\"  for which the law provides penalties that are in  any  of their degrees punishments, an exact idea is given of the gravity of the crime charged in the complaint against the herein defendant.  That crime, as described in the complaint, falls within  the exclusive  jurisdiction of the Courts  of First Instance, and in no case may be tried by the justices of the peace, for the simple reason that  the latter can not in any case, without exceeding  their  jurisdiction,  impose  the penalty of  disqualification, be it  temporary or perpetual, special or absolute.  Once the Court of First Instance acquired jurisdiction by virtue of the terms of the complaint, for the trial of the crime charged therein, it did not afterwards lose it through the mere circumstance that the crime which in fact was proven at the trial, was of less gravity, and the court could, therefore, continue to try the case and pass final judgment, for the reason that this latter crime is necessarily included in that which was charged in the complaint.  It is rather in substance the same crime, with the sole difference that it was committed by the defendant, according to the evidence, as a private party, and not as the president of the municipal board of health, as alleged in the complaint.  This case is expressly provided for in General Orders No. 58, section 29 of which provides as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The court may find the defendant guilty of any offense, or of any frustrated or attempted offense, the commission of which is necessarily included in the charge in the complaint or information.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>It is not necessary to say that it may occur and does in fact quite frequently  occur, that the lesser offense included iri; that which is  the subject of the complaint,  especially when it is not  of a higher class than that  of frustrated or attempted  offenses, is punished by law with a penalty of less than six months imprisonment, and nevertheless the legal provision just above transcribed expressly empowers the judges of the Courts of First Instance, without distinction of cases  or of penalties, to find the defendant guilty of any such lesser offense: which shows in a conclusive manner that the levity or insignificance of the penalty adequate to the offense such as was  actually proved, does not and can not impair the jurisdiction which they acquired, at the commencement of the trial of the cause, by virtue of the facts alleged in the complaint, when these come prima facie within their legal jurisdiction.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with the exception of that part thereof which sentences the defendant to the reimbursement of the sum of 25 centavos to Crispulo           Masaya, which part is hereby reversed; with the costs of this instance against the appellant.<\/p>\n<em> Torres, Johnson, Carson,<\/em> and <em>Moreland, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<br\/>\n<br\/>\n<br\/>\n<hr align=\"left\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/>\n<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> U.S. <em>vs.<\/em> Casin.\n<p><sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[2]<\/sup>  U.S. <em>vs.<\/em> Dacuycuy<\/p>\n<\/div>",

The justice of the peace held a preliminary investigation as required by law, and after considering the testimony presented, dismissed the complaint and released the two accused. Subsequently thereto and on the 18th of February, 1911, the provincial fiscal examined the record made in that preliminary investigation by the justice of the peace and reached the conclusion that there was sufficient proof to bring the accused parties to trial. Whereupon he filed an information in the Court of First Instance, signed by himself as prosecuting officer, charging the said Romana Quilatan and Simon Santiago with the crime of adultery. Upon the filing of this information, the judge of the Court of First Instance issued an order for the arrest of the accused parties on the 21st of February. Pursuant to the order thus issued, the parties were arrested on October 4, 1911, and confined in the provincial jail of that province. These accused parties, believing their confinement to be illegal, caused to be filed in this court on the 27th of November, 1911, an application for a writ of <i>habeas corpus<\/i> for the purpose of determining the legality of their confinement.<br\/><br\/>The record fails to disclose whether or not Silvino Vitales, husband of the petitioner Romana Quilatan, is now or was at any time a public official or employee.<br\/><br\/>The question whether or not the Court of First Instance had jurisdiction to order the arrest and confinement of the petitioners upon the information of the fiscal is squarely before us.

Hereafter the crimes of <i>adulterio, estupro<\/i>, <i> rapto, violation, calumnia<\/i>, and <i>injuria<\/i>, as defined by the Penal Code of the Philippine Islands, shall be deemed to be public crimes and shall be prosecuted in the same manner as are all other crimes defined by said Penal Code or by the Acts of the Philippine Commission: <i>Provided, however<\/i>, That no prosecution for the crimes of <i>adulterio, estupro<\/i>, or <i>injuria<\/i> committed against persons other than public officials or employees shall be instituted except upon the complaint of the aggrieved person or of the parents, grandparents, or guardian of such person.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It can not be determined from the word \"committed,\" as used in the above section, whether it is singular or plural, as it is spelled the same in both forms. This past participle might refer to all three of the crimes or just the latter only. Grammatically speaking, this can not be definitively and with certainty determined. In the Spanish text, it is used in the plural form (<i>cometidos<\/i>).<br\/><br\/>To determine the question whether or not the crimes of adultery and seduction, when committed against public officers and employees can be instituted and carried forward to a final determination upon the information of the provincial fiscal alone, we must look to the intent of the Legislature.<br\/><br\/>Prior to the passage of Act No. 1773 the crimes of adultery and seduction were purely private offenses and could not be prosecuted except, for the first crime, upon the complaint of the offended husband, and for the second, upon the complaint of the offended party or her parents, grandparents, or guardian. The prosecuting officer had no authority to institute the proceedings in either one of these cases, while, on the other hand, it was not necessary in every instance that there should be a complaint filed by the injured party before a person could be prosecuted for the crime of <i>injuria<\/i>. In other words, there were two classes of insults. Those directed against private parties which could not be prosecuted <i>de oficio<\/i> or on the initiative and through the public prosecutor, and those against the authorities, public officials, or agents of the authorities which were real public crimes and which could be prosecuted by the prosecuting officer the same as other public offenses.<br\/><br\/>There existed sound reasons of public policy which forbade the prosecution of persons charged with the crimes of adultery and seduction except upon the complaint of the aggrieved person or of the parents, grandparents, or guardian of such person. There also existed the same reason which prohibited the institution of criminal proceedings against a person charged with insults except upon the complaint of the aggrieved person when such person was not one of the excepted classes. The Philippine Commission intended that these underlying principles of the Penal Code should remain in force. By Act No. 1773 these offenses were made public crimes and the control of the prosecution of the same was taken out of the hands of the offended parties when the proceedings were once instituted. The Commission realized that when public officials or employees were attacked, the Government was, to some extent, interested, and found it necessary to authorize its prosecuting officers to go forward upon their own initiative in cases of <i>injuria<\/i> without being compelled to await the filing of a complaint by the offended party. And again, if a public official or employee is insulted when he is in the performance of his duty and he fails to come forward with the proper complaint, it might be necessary, in certain cases, to have the whole affair judicially investigated for the benefit of the service. In order to do this, it was thought advisable to confer authority upon the prosecuting officer to institute criminal proceedings. This is not true, however, in reference to the crimes of adultery and seduction, even though the offended parties be public officials or employees. The nature and character of the crimes are distinctly different. In the first class (adultery and seduction) the Government has no special interest, while in the second (<i>injuria<\/i>), the Government is interested to the extent that one of its officials or employees is involved. So it is clear that criminal proceedings can not be instituted against persons charged with the crimes of adultery and seduction, although the offended parties may be public officials or employees, except upon the complaint of the offended party or (in the case of seduction) her parents, grandparents, or guardian. While, on the other hand, the prosecuting officer can institute, upon his own initiative, a criminal action against a person charged with insults when the offended party is a public official or employee and in the performance of his duty when such insults were uttered.<br\/><br\/>The word \"committed\" as used in the first section of Act No. 1773 is singular in form, and the same word in the Spanish text should be changed accordingly.<br\/><br\/>In the case at bar the criminal proceedings were instituted against the petitioner in the court of the justice of the peace upon a complaint of the offended husband. He had a perfect right to commence that action. In fact, he was the only one who could do so. The justice of the peace, after making a preliminary investigation, found that there did not exist reasonable cause to believe that an offense had been committed, and that the accused parties were guilty thereof. He thereupon dismissed the complaint and discharged the defendants. This definitively and finally terminated that case. The offended party could have presented another complaint for the same offense, charging the defendants with the same crime, if he had so desired. He having failed to do this, the case, as we have said, was terminated as far as the whole world was concerned. The fiscal was without authority to institute in the Court of First Instance a new proceeding by filing an information. The filing of this information gave the court no jurisdiction whatever over the persons of the petitioners and the subject matter of the action. In order to give the court jurisdiction over the persons of the petitioners and the subject matter of the action, it was necessary that the complaint defined by section 4 of General Orders, No. 58, be made and executed in writing by the offended party personally; such jurisdiction could be acquired in no other way.

Rep., 233.)<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, we are of the opinion that the petitioners are illegally deprived of their liberty, and it is therefore ordered that they be released from confinement forthwith.<br\/><br\/>Costs <i>de oficio<\/i>.<br\/><br\/><i> Arellano, C.

S. Crossfield judge of the Court of First Instance of Manila, for homicide resulting f reckless negligence. The information charges:\u00a0 <blockquote><p>\"That on or about November\u00a0 2, 1911, in the city of Manila, Philippine the said\u00a0 Segundo Barias\u00a0 was a\u00a0 motorman on street car No.\u00a0 9, run\u00a0 7, the\u00a0 Pasay-Cervantes lines of the Manila Electric Railroad and Light Com a corporation\u00a0 duly\u00a0 organized and doing business in the city of Manila, Philippine Islands; as\u00a0 such motorman he was controlling and operating street car along Rizal Avenue, formerly\u00a0 Calle Cervantes, of this city, such motorman of said street car he was under obligation to run the same with due\u00a0 care and diligence to avoid any accident that might occur to vehicles and pedestrians who were traveling on said Rizal Avenue; said accused, at said time and place, did willfully, with reckless imprudence inexcusable negligence and in violation of the regulations promulgated t effect, control and\u00a0 operate\u00a0 said street car, without heeding the pedes crossing Rizal Avenue from one side to the other, thus knocking down and causing by his carelessness and imprudent negligence that said street ca 9, operated and\u00a0 controlled by said accused,\u00a0 as\u00a0 herein before\u00a0 stated, should knock\u00a0 down\u00a0 and pass over the body and head of one Fermina Jose, a girl 2 years old, who at said time and place was crossing the sa Rizal Avenue,\u00a0 the\u00a0 body\u00a0 of\u00a0 said\u00a0 girl being\u00a0 dragged along the street car\u00a0 track on said\u00a0 Rizal Avenue for a long distance,\u00a0 thus\u00a0 crushing\u00a0 a destroying\u00a0 her head\u00a0 and causing her sudden death as a result of the in received; that if the acts executed by the accused had been done with malice, he would be guilty of the serious crime of homicide.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The\u00a0 defendant was a motorman for\u00a0 the\u00a0 Manila Electric Railroad and Light\u00a0 Company.\u00a0 At about\u00a0 6 o'clock on the morning of November 2, 1911, he was driving his car along Rizal Avenue\u00a0 and\u00a0 stopped\u00a0 it near the intersection of that street with Calle\u00a0 Requesen to take on some passeng When the car stopped, the defendant looked backward, presumably to note whether all the\u00a0 passengers were aboard, and then started his car.\u00a0\u00a0 At that moment Fermina Jose, a child\u00a0 about\u00a0 3 years old, walked or ran in front of the car.\u00a0 She was\u00a0 knocked down and\u00a0 dragged some little distance underneath the car, and was\u00a0 left dead upon the track. The motorman proceeded with his car to\u00a0 the end of the track, some distance from the place of the accident,\u00a0 and apparently knew nothing of it until return, when he was informed of what had happened.<\/p><p>There is no\u00a0 substantial\u00a0 dispute as to the facts.\u00a0 It is true that one testified that the defendant started the car without turning his head, a while he\u00a0 was still looking backwards and that this\u00a0 testimony was\u00a0 dire contradicted by that of another witness.\u00a0\u00a0 But we do not deem it necessary to make an express finding as to the precise direction in which the defendant's head was turned at the\u00a0 moment when he started\u00a0 his car.\u00a0 It is\u00a0 sufficient for the purpose of\u00a0 our\u00a0 decision\u00a0 to\u00a0 hold, as we\u00a0 do, the evidence clearly\u00a0 discloses that\u00a0 he started his car from\u00a0 a standstout without looking over the track immediately in front of the car to satisfy himself that it was clear.\u00a0 He did not see the child until after he had car over it, and\u00a0 after he had returned to the\u00a0 place where it was found dead, and we think we are justified in saying that wherever he was looking at the moment\u00a0 when he started his car,\u00a0 he was not looking at the track immediately in front of the car,\u00a0 and that\u00a0 he had not\u00a0 satisfied himself that this portion of the track was clear immediately before putting the motion.<\/p><p>The trial court found the defendant guilty of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">imprudencia temeraria<\/span> (reckless negligence) as charged in the information, and sentenced him one year and one month of imprisonment in Bilibid Prison, and to pay the costs of the action.<\/p><p>The sole question raised by this appeal is whether the evidence shows su carelessness or want\u00a0 of ordinary care on the\u00a0 part of\u00a0 the defendant\u00a0 a to\u00a0 amount\u00a0 to\u00a0 reckless negligence\u00a0 (<em>imprudencia\u00a0 temeraria<\/em>).<\/p><p>Judge Cooley in\u00a0 his work on Torts (3d ed., 1324) defines negligence to \"The failure to observe, for\u00a0 the protection\u00a0 of the interests of another person, that degree of care, precaution and vigilance which\u00a0 the circumstances justly demand, whereby such other person suffers injury.\"<\/p><p>In the case\u00a0 of U.

Pitt,\u00a0 according to a public instrument executed in Manila\u00a0 on December 8, 1908, before the notary public Florencio\u00a0 Gonzalez\u00a0 Diez; that it was free from all incumbrance, and that there was no one, besides the applicants, who had any right or share therein.<\/p><p>The Attorney-General, in behalf of the Director of Lands, by\u00a0 a\u00a0 writing of July 23, 1909,\u00a0 opposed the registration sought of that portion of\u00a0 the said land comprised\u00a0 between the line marked \"face of retaining wall\" and the water of the bay,\u00a0 as shown in the attached plan\u00a0 which was made an integral part of the opponent's brief, on the ground that such land belonged to\u00a0 the Government of the United States and was under the control of the\u00a0 Philippine Government, and asked that the applicants' petition be denied arid that, should the disputed parcel of land be found to belong to the Insular Government, it be adjudicated thereto\u00a0 and the proper certificate of registration issued in the name of the same.<\/p><p>The case came to trial on the 15th and 24th of September, 1909, and\u00a0 oral and documentary evidence was introduced by\u00a0 the parties thereto.\u00a0 On the 27th of September of the same year, an\u00a0 ocular inspection\u00a0 was made\u00a0 of\u00a0 the land in controversy and\u00a0 in the record thereof\u00a0 an entry was\u00a0 made attesting to the presence\u00a0 on the said property, of the attorney,\u00a0 Francisco Qrtigas, of the honorable judge of the Court of Land Registration, of the assistant\u00a0 attorney, Juan Medina, in representation of the Director of Lands, and of the architect, Arcadio Arellano, in behalf of the applicants, and, further, to the following facts: That Mr. L. C. Knight did not\u00a0 remain on the ground referred to, but left after having seen the situation of the stones, the subject of the inspection, stating that it was\u00a0 not necessary for him to be present at the latter; that, during the said proceedings, Attorney Ortigas requested that\u00a0 the facts hereinafter stated be made of record, to wit, that the two last layers of stone in the lower\u00a0 part of the foundation, as could be seen, were of old stones and formed the\u00a0 base\u00a0 of the old foundation; that the\u00a0 extreme outer line of the building, toward\u00a0 the shore, did not\u00a0 extend beyond\u00a0 the line of\u00a0 the old foundation;\u00a0 that, before the wall such as\u00a0 it appeared to be constructed,\u00a0 there still\u00a0 existed\u00a0 the remains of several\u00a0 piles, as one of them was\u00a0 plainly in sight, which indicated\u00a0 the limit\u00a0 of the\u00a0 old Wall; that,\u00a0 at the\u00a0 end of Gallera Street, in the\u00a0 part\u00a0 thereof adjacent\u00a0 to the\u00a0 sea, there was an area which embraced nearly two-thirds of the space comprised hetween the shore and San Jose Street and on which masonry work\u00a0 had been constructed to prevent the waves from continuing to undermine the ground of Gallera Street, the foundation\u00a0 of the said masonry work coinciding, more or less, with\u00a0 that of\u00a0 the wall of the property in question; that the ramp\u00a0 of the wall mentioned,\u00a0 which was still preserved as formerly,\u00a0 had been\u00a0 partly\u00a0 expropriated by\u00a0 the municipality, ancj formed a united\u00a0 part of the old foundation in sight;\u00a0 and that, at the time of the inspection, if was low-tide.\u00a0 AH of the foregoing facts, stated by\u00a0 Attorney Ortigas, were\u00a0 by order of the court made of record.<\/p><p>On\u00a0 the 16th of March, 1910,\u00a0 the attorneys for the applicants\u00a0 and the Attorney-General presented,\u00a0 with a plan of the land, an\u00a0 agreement of facts couched in the following terms;\u00a0 Whereas L.\u00a0 G.\u00a0 Knight died in\u00a0 November of last year after having stipulated (p. 40 of the record)\u00a0 with\u00a0 the counsel for the applicants that he would\u00a0 appear on\u00a0 the premises\u00a0 and land in question during\u00a0 the time of high\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 tide,\u00a0\u00a0 said counsel and the Attorney-General have agreed, very\u00a0 particularly the former, to compromise\u00a0 and\u00a0 admit, as of a thing decided, that during the high and the mean tides\u00a0 the water of Manila Bay reaches as far as the\u00a0 perpendicular face of the\u00a0 old retaining wall which formerly served as a boundary of the land sought to be registered, which is equivalent to saying that the ramp\u00a0 of the\u00a0 said retaining wall then becomes entirely covered by the water Which reaches\u00a0 the point\u00a0 marked X on the attached\u00a0 plan that\u00a0 forms a part\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 present agreement (p.\u00a0 54 of record).<\/p><p>By a written\u00a0 petition of April 20, 1910, counsel for the applicants set forth that, as one of the latter, Carmen Mestres,\u00a0 had\u00a0 died,, they requested that the name\u00a0 of the\u00a0 said deceased be substituted by that of Gregoria R. Yangco, 63 years of age, a\u00a0 widow\u00a0 of the late Benito Mestres and to whom, as the mother and sole heir of\u00a0 Carmen\u00a0 Mestres, all the latter's estate was awarded, in accordance with the order of partition of January 15, 1910, issued <em>in re<\/em> the intestate estate of the said deceased, Carmen Mestres.<\/p><p>A day having been set for a continuation of\u00a0 the hearing of the case, the parties petitioned that judgment be\u00a0 rendered without further proceedings,\u00a0 and on November 28, 1910, the court pronounced judgment\u00a0 by disallowing the adverse claim filed by the Director of Lands and by decreeing the registration and adjudication of the said property in favor of Amada Mestres y Yangco and Gregoria R. Yangco y Ronquillo, in accordance with Act No. 496, together with other findings.\u00a0\u00a0 From this judgment the acting Attorney-General excepted, moved for a\u00a0 rehearing and announced his intention to file a bill of exceptions.\u00a0 By order of December 24, the said motion was overruled and an exception\u00a0 there to was taken on the part of the Attorney-General with the request\u00a0 that all\u00a0 the evidence adduced by both parties contained in the record be made an\u00a0 integral part\u00a0 of the bill of exceptions which, when\u00a0 presented,\u00a0 was approved\u00a0 and transmitted to the clerk of this court.<\/p><p>The opposition of counsel for the Director of Lands to the inscription in the property registry of the land in question, belonging to the applicants,\u00a0 solely concerns the portion or strip of the latter's lot on the side thereof next to Manila Bay and which is occupied by the containing wall constructed with a ramp by some former owner of the land for the purpose of preventing an encroachment thereon of the water of the\u00a0 sea and\u00a0 a destruction of the property thereby,\u00a0 or,\u00a0 according\u00a0 to\u00a0 the\u00a0 plan\u00a0 that\u00a0 accompanied the opponent's claim and is found on page 23 of the record, the portion of land\u00a0 comprised\u00a0 between\u00a0 the line marked with the words \"face of retaining wall' and the water of Manila Bay.\u00a0\u00a0 Said counsel claims that\u00a0 this strip of land belongs to the Government of\u00a0 the United States and is\u00a0 under the control of the Philippine Government.<\/p><p>The adverse claim\u00a0 is founded on\u00a0 the alleged fact that, as the said portion or strip is shore\u00a0 land, it belongs to the public domain, in proof of which counsel for the opponent and appellant cited article 339 of the Civil Code and article 1 of the Law of Waters of August 3,1886.\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>The said article 339 of the Civil Code provides: \"Property of public ownership is -\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"1.\u00a0 That destined to the public use, such as roads, canals, rivers, torrents, ports, and bridges constructed by the State, and banks, shores, roadsteads,\u00a0 and that of a similar character.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Article 1\u00a0 of the Law of Waters of August 3, 1886,\u00a0 published in the Official Gazette of September\u00a0 24, 1871,\u00a0 with <em>cumplase<\/em> decree of the Governor-General of these Islands, is as follows:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"The following are part of the national domain open to public use:\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"1.\u00a0 The coasts or maritime frontiers of Spanish territory, with their coves, inlets, creeks,\u00a0 roadsteads, bays, and ports.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"2.\u00a0 The coast sea, that is, the maritime zone encircling the coasts, to the full width recognized by international law.

G.\u00a0 Eastwick, an agent of\u00a0 the International Bank, as the attorney-in-fact of Mr.\u00a0 William S. Makenson, of the State of California, in favor of the said Harold M. Pitt, it likewise appears from the description of the metes and bounds of the said land that the same\u00a0 is bounded on the rear, the southeast side, by the shore of the bay, and that three small houses of light material existed on the lot.<\/p><p>In the certificates of the registrar of titles of this city (pp.\u00a0 14 and 25 of the record), it likewise appears,\u00a0 in the descriptive part relative\u00a0 to the said lot, that the same\u00a0 is bounded on\u00a0 the rear, the southeast side, by the shore of the bay, and further that one of the former acquirers of the property had purchased it, on July 15, 1890, from its original owner, Benigna Sinchongco.<\/p><p>So that the containing wall, constructed on the extreme end of the land in question towards the bay, was not erected on the shore,\u00a0 but on\u00a0 the\u00a0 very portion\u00a0 or strip of the lot bounded by the shore, and was built, not by the applicants in 1909, who erected\u00a0 the\u00a0 building that is on the said lot, but, several years before, by some one of the former owners of the land and for the purpose of preventing the encroachment of the water of the bay and preventing the destruction of the land by the natural action of such\u00a0 water.<\/p><p>Through the ocular inspection made by the judge of the Court of\u00a0 Land Registration, in the presence of the\u00a0 applicant's attorney, the assistant attorney and an employee of the Bureau of Lands, all of whom officially visited the said land,\u00a0 it was verified in an unquestionable manner, and, as a\u00a0 result of the inspection,\u00a0 it was\u00a0 made\u00a0 of record, that the two last layers of stone in\u00a0 the lower part of the foundation of the building, which projected\u00a0 out of the\u00a0 water of the sea, were of old and ancient stones; that the extreme outer line of the new building, toward the shore, did not extend beyond the line of the ancient foundation consisting of the said old stones that, in front of the containing wall,\u00a0 there still existed the remains of\u00a0 several\u00a0 piles, one of them plainly in sight, which indicated the limit of the old wall; that, at the end of Gallera Street, in the part thereof immediately adjacent to the sea, there was an area which\u00a0 embraced nearly two-thirds of the space comprised between the shore and San Jose Street and on which masonry work had been constructed to prevent the waves from continuing to undermine the ground of Gallera Street, the\u00a0 foundation of the said masonry\u00a0 work coinciding, more or\u00a0 less,\u00a0 with that of the wall of the applicant's building; that the ramp of the aforementioned containing wall, which had been preserved in its\u00a0 former state,\u00a0 formed, in\u00a0 a part thereof that had been expropriated by\u00a0 the municipality, a\u00a0 united whole with the old foundation in\u00a0 sight; and that, at the time of the inspection, it was\u00a0 low tide.\u00a0\u00a0 All of the foregoing particulars were by the court made of record, as being positive facts.<\/p><p>The\u00a0 contractor, Arcadio Arellano, stated in an\u00a0 affidavit, page 43 of the\u00a0 record, that upon examining for\u00a0 the first time the side of the lot toward the bay,\u00a0 he found that the aforesaid containing wall existed, with its ramp,\u00a0 and was provided with\u00a0 a stone railing; that the new house erected on the lot was constructed on the side toward the sea, on the said containing wall,\u00a0 which was very old and had already existed on\u00a0 the said side of the lot prior to the construction of the house that was standing there, the outer line of which did not exceed the outer line of the said\u00a0 wall on which the uprights of the house stood; and that there was a distance of about 20 meters between the containing wall mentioned and the containing wall of the boulevard then being built.<\/p><p>As a result of the construction of the port of Manila and of the\u00a0 breakwater running\u00a0 toward Malate and Pasay, and owing\u00a0 to the work done on\u00a0 the reclaimed land, the water therefrom\u00a0 has for some little time past been inundating the shores\u00a0 and lots of the districts of Malate and Ermita, which indicates either\u00a0 a slow and gradual sinking\u00a0 of the\u00a0 lands near the bay or that, through other causes, there is a greater rise of the water of\u00a0 the bay in the ebb and flow\u00a0 thereof, thereby bringing about the inundation of the said lots.<\/p><p>Counsel\u00a0 for the applicants, in their brief in this\u00a0 instance, state without\u00a0 contradiction\u00a0 that the shore immediately adjacent\u00a0 to the District of Ermita extended at low tide to a distance of about a hundred brazas from the extreme end of Gallera\u00a0 Street, but that that shore has now disappeared, for the municipality had to construct a containing wall to prevent the destruction, by the encroachment of the water of the sea, of the part of the said street bordering on the bay.<\/p><p>Though the shore next to the lot in question and to Gallera Street should have\u00a0 disappeared, on account of its\u00a0 being covered\u00a0 by the water of the sea,\u00a0 and the building constructed by the applicants on the said old containing wall, which was already in\u00a0 existence before they purchased the lot in question from the last of its previous owners, should now appear to border on the water\u00a0 of the bay, it does not necessarily follow that the containing wall in litigation was constructed on\u00a0 the\u00a0 shore, because the latter\u00a0 was beyond the limits of the lot in question and at the present time is under water.\u00a0 It is undeniable that when the said containing wall was constructed,\u00a0 the water of the sea was\u00a0 already making\u00a0 advances toward the\u00a0 lot mentioned\u00a0 and entirely covered the shore on which it then bordered, and that this wall was erected in anticipation of the damages that might result to the property\u00a0 therefrom.<\/p><p>Moreover,\u00a0 there is no proof in the record that the land sought to be registered has at the present time a greater lineal extension on the side next to\u00a0 the bay than it should have, nor that a part of the building erected\u00a0 on the land projects or extends beyond the outer line of the old. containing wall immediately\u00a0 adjoining the sea,\u00a0 thereby invading property belonging to the state.<\/p><p>In conclusion, it appears, then, to\u00a0 have been\u00a0 duly proved that the said containing wall\u00a0 was erected by one of\u00a0 thfe original\u00a0 owners of the property, on and\u00a0 within the same, and that the opponent has not established that it was constructed\u00a0 on the shore or on public\u00a0 land belonging to\u00a0 the Government.\u00a0 Therefore, the adverse claim filed by counsel for the Director of Lands has no legal foundation\u00a0 and there is no just nor\u00a0 reasonable ground\u00a0 upon\u00a0 which to oppose the registration of the said land as\u00a0 the exclusive property of the applicants.\u00a0 The land herein concerned is in similar circumstances to that referred to in\u00a0 case No. 6019, Aragon vs. The Insular\u00a0 Government (19\u00a0 Phil. Rep., 233).<\/p><p>For the foregoing reasons, whereby the errors assigned to the judgment appealed from are held to have been refuted, it is our opinion that the said judgment should be affirmed, with the costs against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<\/p><p><em>Arellano, C.

Lobingier, and Generoso Polintan before the Honorable Herbert D. Gale. As the facts in both appeals are the same, they will be considered together.<\/p><p>In the month of September, 1910, Severina Gamboa, an unmarried girl, 14 years of age, was living with her parents at No.\u00a0 19 Calle Marina, Pasay, and was\u00a0 employed as a dancing girl in\u00a0 a dance hall at Pasig,\u00a0 where she was in the habit of going each night in\u00a0 company with her mother. Jacinto Borromeo met this young girl in the dance hall and became enamored with her personal beauty and\u00a0 charms. About 10 o'clock on the night of September 10,\u00a0 he called together Raymundo Ramos,\u00a0 Jose Buenaventura, and Generoso and Marcelino Polintan, and they\u00a0 rented a four-passenger automobile and twp calesas in which they went from Manila\u00a0 to Pasig on that night.\u00a0 Borromeo, Buenaventura, and\u00a0 Generoso Polintan occupied the automobile and Ramos and Marcelino Polintan each occupied a ealesa.\u00a0\u00a0 Upon arriving in Pasig they went to the dance hall where they found Severina Gamboa and her mother.\u00a0 They waited there until the hall was closed\u00a0 at about 12\u00a0 o'clock that night.\u00a0 When Severina and her mother came out of the dance hall Borromeo and his companions invited them to return to Manila in the\u00a0 automobile.\u00a0\u00a0 Both the mother and the daughter declined to accept this invitation and proceeded to the station in Pasig for the purpose of coming: to Manila in a street car.\u00a0\u00a0 Borromeo and his companions then returned to Manila. On the\u00a0 return trip one of the <em>calesas<\/em> lost a\u00a0 tire\u00a0 and was put out of commission.\u00a0 The .other ealesa and the automobile came on to Calle Bagumbayan\u00a0 and there waited for the arrival\u00a0 of the Pasig street car.\u00a0 When this cat arrived it was\u00a0 about\u00a0 1 o'clock and the cars had stopped running to Pasay.\u00a0 When the two women arrived they not being able to proceed to their home in a street car,\u00a0 called\u00a0 <em>calesa <\/em>which was passing\u00a0 back and forth at that point and informed\u00a0 the driver, one Tomas de Jesus, that they desired to hire his vehicle for the purpose of taking them to their home in Pasay,\u00a0 they believing that the ealesa driven by De Jesus was a street or public\u00a0 vehicle.\u00a0 This calesa, as well as the one which\u00a0 was put out of commission, was hired from a livery\u00a0 stable by\u00a0 Borromeo\u00a0 and his companions. After the two women had embarked in the calesa\u00a0 they proceeded on their way to Pasay.\u00a0 After going a short distance they noticed an automobile in front\u00a0 of\u00a0 them but they paid no attention to it until their cochero refused\u00a0 to continue on in the direction indicated by them\".\u00a0 The cochero insisted on following the automobile, he being\u00a0 under instructions to follow the automobile.\u00a0\u00a0 The automobile and the calesa proceeded in this manner\u00a0 until they arrived\u00a0 at a lonely spot on Calle Vito Cruz, near a swamp and bridge in that vicinity.\u00a0 At this\u00a0 point the automobile had\u00a0 stopped and\u00a0 was\u00a0 awaiting the arrival\u00a0 of the calesa.\u00a0 When the latter arrived to within a very short distance of the automobile, the\u00a0 cochero\u00a0 stopped\u00a0 it and\u00a0 the four\u00a0 appellants alighted from the automobile\u00a0 and\u00a0 coming up\u00a0 to the ealesq seized the two women.\u00a0 Jacinto Borromeo, Generoso Polintan, and\u00a0 one other seized\u00a0 the girl, and took her from the calesa and placed her in\u00a0 the automobile.\u00a0\u00a0 The other appellant seized the mother\u00a0 and\u00a0 prevented her from going to the rescue of her daughter.\u00a0\u00a0 In the ensuing struggle, the mother's clothes were torn and she was finally thrown into the ditch\u00a0 or swamp adjacent to the road.\u00a0 The four appellants,\u00a0 with the girl, then\u00a0 left the spot in the automobile. As the girl was being carried away from her mother in this manner, both she and\u00a0 her mother began screaming\u00a0 and crying for help.\u00a0 The mother, after getting out of the ditch, started to pursue the automobile\u00a0 on foot,\u00a0 but\u00a0 not being able\u00a0 to overtake it, was compelled\u00a0 to\u00a0 abandon the pursuit. The screams of the two women as they were being separated were heard by one Ellis who was sleeping on the veranda of his house\u00a0 near that place.\u00a0\u00a0 After the\u00a0 automobile had gone a\u00a0 short distance, it passed the witness Algard, who saw the girl struggling\u00a0 and heard her\u00a0 suppressed cries.\u00a0 Borromeo was at that moment attempting to prevent her from screaming by placing his hands over her mouth.\u00a0 This witness also saw the mother pursuing the machine.\u00a0 The four appellants took the girl to the house of the appellant Ramos in Calle Balic-balic, where she remained until the afternoon of the eleventh.\u00a0\u00a0 The mother proceeded on foot to her home in\u00a0 Pasay, changed her clothes, and accompanied by her husband and a neighbor\u00a0 immediately returned to Manila to search for her daughter and the appellants.\u00a0 They went to\u00a0 Calle Azcarraga because the mother remembered having heard some of the appellants say\u00a0 that they were living on that street.\u00a0 Very early that morning, the mother and\u00a0 her\u00a0 companions encountered on that street Marcelind Polintan, Jose Buenaventura, and Generoso Polintan\u00a0 in, company with two other\u00a0 men.\u00a0\u00a0 They\u00a0 seized\u00a0 and\u00a0 held Buenaventura and Marcelino Polintan, called a police officer, and\u00a0 had\u00a0 them arrested.\u00a0 Generoso Polintan and the other two men made their escape.\u00a0 Buenaventura and Marcelino Polintan\u00a0 were conducted to the Meisic police station and after the police officers had heard the account of the abduction of the girl Severina, they immediately took steps to find her, and finally did' succeed in locating her in the house of Raymundo Ramos in company with Jacinto Borromeo and Raymundo Ramos.\u00a0 Early on the morning of September 11, Generoso Polintan returned\u00a0 to the house of Ramos in Balic-balic and advised Borromeo and Ramos of the capture of his companions and that he was going to make his escape.\u00a0 Generoso did in fact make his escape and was not captured until some six months later, when he was finally arrested in the Province of Zambales and brought back to Manila.\u00a0 On being advised by Generoso Polintan that Buenaventura and Marcelino Polintan had been arrested, Borromeo, with the\u00a0 assistance of Ramos, attempted to marry Severina, and for this purpose they called to the house of\u00a0 Ramos two Protestant ministers, Ricardo Luzada and Nicolas Zamora, and Santiago Castalian [Gatchalian], a notary public.\u00a0 But the\u00a0 marriage did not\u00a0 actually take place.\u00a0 The foregoing facts are not only established by the direct and positive testimony of credible witnesses, but they are practically admitted by the appellants.\u00a0 Severina, the offended\u00a0 party, testified that on her arrival at the house of Ramos about 2 o'clock a. m. on that night, she was placed in a room with Borromeo where they remained\u00a0 together until1 after daylight; and that during this time Borromeo had carnal relations with her three times.\u00a0 Two members of the Manila police force further testified that the defendant Borromeo had admitted in their presence that he\u00a0 had had sexual intercourse with the girl\u00a0 during that night.<\/p><p>The\u00a0 appellants\u00a0 in\u00a0 this\u00a0 instance\u00a0 insist\u00a0 (1) that the taking\u00a0 of the girl to the house of Ramos on that night was simply carrying out a prearranged agreement\u00a0 between the offended party and Borromeo;\u00a0 (2) that there\u00a0 were no dishonest designs for the reason that it\u00a0 was the intention of Borromeo and Severinav to marry; and (3) that there were no carnal relations between Borromeo and the\u00a0 offended party in the house of Ramos.<\/p><p>Article 445 of the Penal Code reads:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"The abduction of a woman\u00a0 against her will and with lewd\u00a0 designs shall be punished by <em>reclusion temporal<\/em>.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The essential elements in this crime are two;\u00a0 namely, (1) that the abduction must have been against the will of the woman; and (2) that the abduction must have been for lewd\u00a0 or unchaste designs.\u00a0\u00a0 If either is lacking, a conviction under the above-quoted article can not stand.\u00a0 One is as essential as the other.\u00a0 It takes both to constitute the crime. If unchaste designs are lacking, the taking of the woman against her will might constitute some other crime, but never a violation of this article.<\/p><p>That\u00a0 the appellants took the offended\u00a0 girl to the house of\u00a0 Ramos\u00a0 against\u00a0 her\u00a0 will and against the\u00a0 will\u00a0 of\u00a0 her mother\u00a0 by\u00a0 means\u00a0 of actual\u00a0 force,\u00a0 there\u00a0 cannot\u00a0 be\u00a0 the slightest doubt.\u00a0 The young girl was forcibly separated from\u00a0 her mother,\u00a0 her mother thrown\u00a0 into the ditch or swamp,\u00a0 and she was taken away in the\u00a0 automobile.\u00a0 She attempted to continue her screaming and cries for help, but was prevented from doing so by Borromeo.\u00a0\u00a0 These facts exclude\u00a0 the pretense of the appellants that the girl was taken for the purpose of marrying Borromeo.\u00a0 Had\u00a0 the girl agreed to go with the appellants and marry Borromeo,\u00a0 her conduct would have been quite different\u00a0\u00a0 And again, Borromeo had said nothing, either to the mother or to her daughter, about marriage.\u00a0 The appellants had no\u00a0 other object than that of unchaste designs in taking the girl, and\u00a0 these\u00a0 unchaste designs were carried out.\u00a0 Borromeo had\u00a0 illicit\u00a0 relations with the girl in\u00a0 the house of\u00a0 Ramos. He admitted this fact to two police officers.\u00a0 All that was done and said on the 11th with reference to marrying the girl\u00a0 was an afterthought.\u00a0 This feeble and pretended attempt to marry the girl was made after Borromeo and Ramos had been notified of the capture of their companions and for the sole purpose of escaping criminal responsibility. Borromeo never intended to carry out this feeble attempt of marrying the girl.\u00a0 In the commission of this crime there\u00a0 was present the aggravating circumstance of nocturnity.\u00a0 It is clear that the appellants selected the nighttime for the purpose of committing this crime.\u00a0\u00a0 They knew that\u00a0 they could not accomplish their designs, if at all, in the daytime, not\u00a0 by any means so easily.\u00a0 There\u00a0 were present no extenuating circumstances.<\/p><p>Finally, counsel for the accused pleads that\u00a0 the. sentence imposed by the lower court is cruel and unusual and bases his assertion upon a comparison of the crime of which these appellants\u00a0 have been convicted\u00a0 with the crime of\u00a0 illegal detention when committed under pretense of the exercise of public\u00a0 authority, when serious physical injuries are inflicted upon the person detained, or threats made against his life (art. 482, Penal Code), the penalty being the same for both crimes; i. e., <em>reclusion\u00a0 temporal<\/em> (twelve years\u00a0 and one day to twenty years).<\/p><p>The\u00a0 prohibition in the Philippine Bill against cruel and unusual punishments is an Anglo-Saxon\u00a0 safeguard against governmental oppression of the subject, which made its first appearance in the reign of William and Mary of England in \"An Act declaring the rights and liberties of the subject, and settling the succession of\u00a0 the crown,\" passed in the year 1689.\u00a0\u00a0 It has been incorporated\u00a0 into the\u00a0 Constitution of the\u00a0 United States and into most of the onstitutions of the various States\u00a0 in\u00a0 substantially the same language as that used in the original statute.\u00a0\u00a0 The exact language of the Constitution of\u00a0 the United States is used in the Philippine Bill.\u00a0 It follows that punishments provided in legislation enacted by the\u00a0 former sovereign of these Islands must be considered according to the standard\u00a0 obtaining in the United States in order to determine whether they are cruel and\u00a0 unusual.<\/p><p>According to some authorities, the test to be applied in determining whether a penalty is in violation of this constitutional provision is not the proportion between the offense and\u00a0 the punishment, but the character of the punishment and its mode of infliction, and that \"the legislative discretion in determining the severity of the punishment for crime is not to be interfered with by the courts, so long as all forms of torture are avoided.\"\u00a0\u00a0 Another group of authorities, however, hold that this\u00a0 constitutional provision is broad enough to\u00a0 confer upon the courts the power to review legislative discretion concerning the adequacy of the punishment \"in very extreme cases, where the\u00a0 punishment proposed is so severe and out of proportion to the offense as to shock public sentiment and violate the judgment of reasonable people.\"\u00a0 The\u00a0 authorities\u00a0 pro and con are discussed in Weems<em> vs. <\/em>United States\u00a0 (217 U. S., 349, 54 L. ed., 798), where the court sustained the\u00a0 latter\u00a0 view.\u00a0\u00a0 The supreme court of New York, in treating of this question in People <em>ex rel<\/em>. Kemmler <em>vs.<\/em> Durston\u00a0 (119 N.\u00a0 Y.,\u00a0 569), was undecided whether the provision \"was intended as an admonition to the legislature and the judiciary, or as a restraint upon the legislature in inflicting punishment for criminal offenses,\" stating further\u00a0 that in\u00a0 England\u00a0 the provision \"was not intended\u00a0 as a\u00a0 check upon the powers of Parliament to prescribe\u00a0 such\u00a0 punishment for crime as\u00a0 it considered proper.\"\u00a0\u00a0 But the courts of some of the States have declared unconstitutional\u00a0 statutory\u00a0 punishments\u00a0 which, although not cruel\u00a0 and unusual as to their character and mode of the infliction, were considered so by reason of their severity in proportion to the offense.\u00a0 In Ely <em>vs<\/em>. Thompson\u00a0\u00a0 (3 A. K. Marsh (Reu.), 70), where a person of color was to\u00a0 be punished by\u00a0 corporal punishment for raising \"his or her hand in opposition to any person not being a negro *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *,\" even if in self-defense, the court declared such a\u00a0 punishment to be cruel and unusual within the meaning of the constitutional provision.\u00a0 In Illinois, where the provision reads, \"all penalties shall be\u00a0 proportioned to the nature of the\u00a0 offense,\" the supreme\u00a0 court of that State held\u00a0 (Railroad Co. <em>vs.<\/em>\u00a0 People, <em>Ex rel.<\/em> Koerner, 67 UK, 11, 27, 16 Am. Rep., 599, 611),\u00a0 that a forfeiture of a franchise for unjust discrimination\u00a0 in railroad freights\u00a0 for a first offense, amounting, as it would in some instances, to millions of dollars, was in violation of that clause of the state constitution.\u00a0 The supreme court of\u00a0 Michigan, in Robinson <em>vs<\/em>. Miner and Haug (68 Mich, 549, 563), held that a law which provided for forfeiture of business in addition to fine and imprisonment for violations of the liquor law was cruel and unusual.<\/p><p>In\u00a0 the following cases the question was\u00a0 discussed, but the penalties objected to upheld, the courts, however, insisting that it is\u00a0 possible for the legislature\u00a0 to violate the provision in question by providing a penalty\u00a0 out of all proportion to the offense.<\/p><p>In People <em>vs<\/em>. Oppenheimer (156 Cal., 733), the court said that it is not within the province of the judiciary to declare a penalty fixed by the legislature for a particular crime\u00a0 to be too severe -\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"*\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 unless\u00a0 perhaps it\u00a0 be so disproportionate\u00a0 to the offense for which it is inflicted as to meet the disapproval and condemnation of the\u00a0 conscience\u00a0 and reason\u00a0 of\u00a0 men generally, 'as to shock the moral sense of the people.' \"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>In Thomas <em>vs<\/em>. Kinkead (55 Ark., 502), the court said:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"But the law-making power itself could\u00a0 not, under the constitution,\u00a0 inflict the\u00a0 death penalty as a punishment for a simple misdemeanor.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>In State <em>vs.<\/em> Becker (3 S. D., 29), the\u00a0 court said:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"It is a very noticeable fact that this question has seldom been presented to the courts\u00a0 and we take this fact to signify that\u00a0 it has\u00a0 been the common\u00a0 understanding of all that courts would not be justified in interfering with the discretion and judgment of the legislature, except in very extreme cases, where the punishment proposed is so severe and out of proportion to the offense as to shock public sentiment and violate\u00a0 the judgment of reasonable people.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Even in Massachusetts, where the provision reads: \"No magistrate or court of law shall\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 inflict cruel or unusual punishments,\" it was said in McDonald <em>vs.<\/em> Commonwealth (173\u00a0 Mass., 322):\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"It is for the legislature to determine what acts shall be regarded as\u00a0 criminal, and how they shall be punished. It would be going too far to say that their power is unlimited in these respects.\u00a0 Ordinarily, the terms 'cruel and unusuar imply something inhuman and\u00a0 barbarous in the nature of the punishment.\u00a0\u00a0 (<em>In re<\/em> Kemmler,\u00a0 136\u00a0 U.\u00a0 S., 436.)\u00a0\u00a0 But it is possible that imprisonment in\u00a0 the state\u00a0 prison for a long\u00a0 term of years\u00a0 might\u00a0 be\u00a0 so disproportionate to the offense as to constitute a cruel and unusual punishment.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>On the kindred subject of excessive fines,\u00a0 the supreme court of Vermont, in State\u00a0 <em>vs.<\/em>\u00a0 Constantino (76 Vt, 192), said:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"But the constitutional provision that fines\u00a0 shall be pro-portioned to\u00a0 the offenses is addressed to the Legislature as well as to the courts.\u00a0 The Legislature has\u00a0 the right to prescribe fines, and especially for the punishment of offenses that it creates, and to its judgment and discretion\u00a0 in this behalf a wide latitude must necessarily be accorded.\u00a0 Fines are to be fixed with reference to the object they are designed to accomplish.\u00a0 The degree of criminality of the offense, the illegality or\u00a0 impolicy of the act intended to\u00a0 be punished or prevented, are elements that must be considered.\u00a0\u00a0 The peace of the State and the welfare of the community often require the Legislature\u00a0 to create new offenses and to prescribe fines for their punishment, and to alter fines already prescribed.\u00a0\u00a0 In performing\u00a0 this duty the Legislature has no guide but its judgment and\u00a0 discretion and the wisdom of experience, and the courts cannot properly question its\u00a0 action, unless the minimum fine is so large as to be clearly out of ail just proportion to the offense.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>On this same subject, in McMahon\u00a0 <em>vs<\/em>. State (70 Neb., 722), the court said:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"The fixing of penalties for the violation\u00a0 of statutes\u00a0 is primarily a\u00a0 legislative function, and the courts hesitate to interfere,\u00a0 unless the fine provided for is so\u00a0 far\u00a0 excessive as to shock the sense of mankind.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>In State <em>vs.<\/em> Rodman (58 Minn., 393), the court says:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"While the fines are certainly\u00a0 large, yet we cannot say that they are excessive, in a constitutional sense. A large discretion is necessarily vested in the legislature to impose penalties sufficient to prevent the\u00a0 commission of an offense and it\u00a0 would have to be an extreme case to warrant the courts\u00a0 in\u00a0 holding that the constitutional limit had been transcended,\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>In view of these authorities,\u00a0 and the fact that the legislature invariably\u00a0 endeavors to apportion a penalty\u00a0 commensurate with the offense, and that course, in the exercise of such discretion as is conferred upon them in fixing penalties within minimum and maximum degrees, adhere to the same rule, it seems to\u00a0 us that to assert, when the question assumes the dignity of a constitutional inquiry, that courts should not concern themselves with the relative magnitude of the crime and the penalty, is wrong, both in logic and in\u00a0 fact.\u00a0 A contrary view leads to the astounding result that it is impossible to impose a cruel and unusual\u00a0 punishment so\u00a0 long as none of the old and discarded modes of punishment are used; and that there is no restriction upon the power of the legislative department, for example, to prescribe the death penalty by hanging for a misdemeanor, and that the courts would be compelled to\u00a0 impose the penalty.\u00a0 Yet such a punishment for such a crime would be considered extremely cruel and unusual\u00a0 by all\u00a0 right-minded people. But all courts uniformly express great reluctance to sit in judgment upon the legislative department in a matter where such a large measure of discretion must\u00a0 be exercised, and it appears that in very few cases has this ever been done.<\/p><p>In the case at bar we assume that counsel makes no objection to\u00a0 the\u00a0 mode of punishment.\u00a0 He does, however, attempt to show that the penalty is out\u00a0 of proportion to the crime by comparing the latter with the crime of illegal detention and the\u00a0 infliction of serious, physical injuries. He argues that tfie physical anguish of a\u00a0 woman abducted against her will\u00a0 with unchaste designs cannot compare to the suffering of\u00a0 a person upon whom serious physical injuries are inflicted, or threats made against his life, while illegally detained.\u00a0 There is one common\u00a0 element in these two crimes, the taking without consent.\u00a0\u00a0 But the element of intent is quite different in the two\u00a0 crimes,\u00a0 The intent in illegal detention\u00a0 may\u00a0 be revenge,\u00a0 greed for gain, or caprice; but in abduction the intent is \"with lewd designs.\" This qualification can\u00a0 only mean one thing: a degeneracy on the part of the criminal which strikes at the very foundation of society and calls for severe chastisement, not only to prevent a repetition of the offense on his part, but to serve as a deterrent on others who may also be inclined to lewdness and license.<\/p><p>Pain, physical or mental, should be measured by its permanent effect upon\u00a0 the\u00a0 sufferer.\u00a0 In\u00a0 the\u00a0 case\u00a0 of\u00a0 severe physical\u00a0 injuries, temporary physical pain\u00a0 may be extreme and yet the person may fully recover, after which his injuries become nothing more than a memory, a topic for conversation.\u00a0 The former sufferer may even\u00a0 experience some degree of pride and\u00a0 satisfaction in recalling how he\u00a0 conducted himself at the time they\u00a0 were received.\u00a0 But in the case\u00a0 of a young, innocent girl, ruthlessly torn from\u00a0 the side of her mother\u00a0 in\u00a0 the dead of night,\u00a0 overpowered by superior\u00a0 strength, her cries for help\u00a0 stifled,\u00a0 and rushed to an unknown house and\u00a0 there defiled, there is something more to be endured by her than mere physical pain, although that may not\u00a0 be inconsiderable.\u00a0\u00a0 When such an occurrence ceases\u00a0 to be a reality to her and becomes\u00a0 a memory, if it ever does, she may derive no comfort, no\u00a0 pride, no satisfaction by recalling\u00a0 it.\u00a0 Shame, misery, mortification, are her lot.\u00a0 Nor\u00a0 can she, if\u00a0 she would,\u00a0 banish\u00a0 the dreadful\u00a0 occurrence from her thoughts.\u00a0\u00a0 The story has spread like wildfire.\u00a0\u00a0 Pitying looks, pointing fingers, and morbid stares remind her everywhere she goes of her terrible experience. Temporary physical disability resulting from injuries produce, as a rule, no lasting\u00a0 effects upon the sufferer.\u00a0 In the case of\u00a0 the girl,\u00a0 the effects\u00a0 are permanent and far-reaching.\u00a0 Time may lessen but can never\u00a0 annul her sufferings.\u00a0\u00a0 Nor is she the\u00a0 only sufferer.\u00a0 Her whole family, to a lesser degree, shares in her humiliation.<\/p><p>There are only two modes of\u00a0 punishment in this country by which such a criminal can be effectually prevented from committing a second similar offense;\u00a0 i. e., by imprisonment or death by hanging.\u00a0 To allow the culprit to go free with a fine or civil disqualifications would be no\u00a0 security\u00a0 whatever\u00a0 to society.\u00a0 The legislative\u00a0 department\u00a0 has decided that imprisonment Is adequate for the offense, but that, the crime\u00a0 being of a very aggravated character, in order to attain the twofold end of criminal legislation, i. e., the prevention of a repetition of the\u00a0 offense by the criminal and a warning\u00a0 to others similarly inclined, the imprisonment must extend over a long term\u00a0 of years.\u00a0 Again, it is unnecessary to resort to unusual expedients in order to arrive at a decision as to whether\u00a0 the penalty in this case is too excessive.\u00a0 The crime\u00a0 committed by these appellants has existed since time out of mind\u00a0 and has been dealt with by all nations with the severest penalties, and people have often been so intolerant of the\u00a0 crime that they have been unwilling to await the slow action of the\u00a0 law, but have taken the matter in hand themselves and inflicted death by burning, at the\u00a0 stake,\u00a0 hanging, or any\u00a0 other convenient method.<\/p><p>In view of all these considerations, we are not at all disposed to declare that the penalty\u00a0 fixed by law is cruel and unusual.<\/p><p>Jacinto Borromeo was the moving\u00a0 spirit in the commission of this crime.\u00a0 It was committed for the sole purpose of giving him an opportunity to satisfy his lust\u00a0 and he was the\u00a0 only one who had\u00a0 illicit\u00a0 relations\u00a0 with the girl. The court very properly imposed upon him the maximum of\u00a0 the maximum\u00a0 degree.\u00a0 Under the circumstances,\u00a0 we think\u00a0 the judgment\u00a0 condemning Generoso Polintan\u00a0 to twenty years should\u00a0 be modified\u00a0 by reducing the penalty to seventeen years and four\u00a0 months. With this modification, the judgments appealed\u00a0 from are\u00a0 affirmed, with costs.<\/p><p><em> Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Johnson<\/em>, and <em>Carson, JJ<\/em>., concur.<\/p><\/div>",

CIPRIANO VIDAL ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND  APPELLANTS.\n  <br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>MORELAND, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\"><p>This is  an action  to  recover damages suffered by the plaintiff by reason of injuries sustained  by the steamship <em>Kaifong<\/em> while passing through Iloilo Strait under the control and guidance  of the defendant Cipriano Vidal, as pilot. The court after trial gave judgment against the defendants for P11,316.13, P3,000 property of the Iloilo Pilots' Association to be applied to the payment  thereof, the  balance  to be paid by the defendant Vidal.<\/p>\n<p>The damages herein mentioned were caused to  the steamship <em>Kaifong<\/em> by  striking a rock in Iloilo Strait near the \"Siete Pecados,\" a group of coral islands, by reason of which a  portion of the hull was broken in and other  injuries caused.  At the time the defendant Vidal was a member of the Iloilo Pilots' Association and as such had been named by that  association  to pilot the  <em>Kaifong<\/em> through the Iloilo Strait on the day in question.  The plaintiff had no hand in his selection.<\/p>\n<p>Iloilo  Strait is  a narrow  strip of water lying between Panay and  Guimaras.  It runs northeast and southwest. The main, or northern, channel is about one-third of a mile wide,  with plenty of water in its  center  for  the  largest ships.<\/p>\n<p>From the proofs it appears that, on the day of  the accident, the captain of the ship turned  the  management of the same over to the pilot when she was between one and two miles  east, or, more properly speaking, northeast, of the \"Siete Pecados.\"  At that time the boat was upon the course  usually and ordinarily taken  by  vessels  passing through that strait.  It was  headed directly toward  the lighthouse on one of the \"Siete Pecados.\"  The usual and ordinary course for a vessel passing through the strait is to take what is known as the north channel. In doing this the course, for a  considerable distance after entering the strait, is directly  toward the  light-house.  Arriving at  a point about half a  mile from the light-house, the course is changed to  the northward, from there on describing  a moderate curve which turns again to the southward after passing the \"Siete Pecados.\"<\/p>\n<p>It is the undisputed evidence that this  is  the uniform course for  vessels passing through said  channel.  It is also the undisputed evidence  in  this case that the defendant Vidal did not take this course.  Instead he passed  out of the ordinary course and outside the deeper part of the channel and approached closely the \"Siete Pecados,\" something very  unusual,  if  not  extraordinary, in  vessels passing through  the channel.  So unusual was this  course that the captain spoke to the defendant about it,  saying that he was getting in  too  close to the reefs.  The pilot replied that there was plenty of water there and that there was nothing to fear.  It was less than five minutes after this conversation that the vessel struck.<\/p>\n<p>The obstruction with which the vessel collided  was a pinnacle rock rising alone out of deep water, its summit being at the time about 13 to 14 feet below the surface. This rock, it is conceded, was not charted and did not appear on any hydrographic map of the locality, official or otherwise.  The captain of the ship did not know of the existence of such a rock and the pilot asserts that he did not know of it.  There is uncontradicted evidence, however, of the fact that said rock was known to pilots and local navigators in and about Iloilo as early as 1900 or 1901, a quartermaster's boat having been lost upon that same rock in about  the year 1900.   The name usually given to it was the \"Eighth Sin.\"  It is the undisputed testimony of Captain Hamilton that the existence of that rock was known some years before to the president of the Pilots' Association of Iloilo.<\/p>\n<p>We believe  upon the whole that the case was  properly decided by the court below.  It is a fundamental rule of navigators; especially when traveling through straits, and channels, never  to go outside  of  the usual  and  ordinary course traveled by vessels except for some pressing and substantial reason.   The usual and ordinary course is the safe course.   Any change from that course is more or Jess of an experiment.  This is particularly true in narrow and  uncertain waters.  A ship is not something with which to try experiments.  Too many lives and too much, property are at stake. The usual course of navigators should always be adhered  to under such circumstances as this case  presents unless deviation therefrom is based upon some substantial reason.   Whim or caprice is not enough.  Neither is the desire to experiment or explore.  The pilot in the case at bar having deviated from the usual and ordinary course followed by navigators in  passing through  the strait in question, .without a substantial reason, was guilty of negligence, and that negligence  having been the proximate cause of  the damages, he is liable for such damages as usually  and naturally flow therefrom.   This conclusion is based upon the expert  testimony of the  case presented  by experienced navigators.<\/p>\n<p>There is evidence upon  which we mignt make,a finding of negligence upon the  ground that the defendant should have known of the existence and location of the rock upon which the vessel struck while under his control and management.  We do not, however, find it necessary to do so inasmuch as we may legally and justly base our decision, upon the  proposition that  a navigator passing  through straits and  channels is not permitted to pass  out of the usual and ordinary course followed by navigators without some compelling reason for such change.<\/p>\n<p>All of the other questions in the case are uncontested. The  amount of damages is substantially conceded; the responsibility of  the other defendants  is unquestioned; and the ownership of the vessel by the plaintiffs is conceded of record.   The only question before us is  that of the negligence of the defendant Vidal.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment is hereby  affirmed, without special finding as to costs.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano C.

The justice  of the peace held a preliminary investigation as required by law, and after considering the testimony  presented, dismissed the complaint and released the two accused.   Subsequently thereto and on the 18th of February,  1911, the provincial fiscal examined the record made in that preliminary investigation by the justice of the peace and reached the conclusion that there was sufficient proof to  bring the accused parties to trial.  Whereupon he filed an information in the Court of First Instance, signed by  himself as prosecuting officer,  charging the said Romana Quilatan and  Simon Santiago with the  crime of adultery.   Upon the filing of this information, the judge of the Court  of First Instance issued an order for the arrest of the accused parties on the 21st of February.  Pursuant to the order thus issued, the parties were arrested on October  4, 1911,  and confined  in the provincial  jail of  that province.   These accused parties,  believing their confinement to be illegal,  caused  to be filed in  this court on the 27th of November, 1911, an application for a writ of <em>habeas corpus<\/em> for the purpose of determining the legality of their confinement.<\/p>\n<p>The record fails to disclose whether or not Silvino Vitales, husband of the petitioner Romana Quilatan, is  now or was at any time a  public official  or employee.<\/p>\n<p>The question whether or not the  Court of First Instance had jurisdiction  to order the arrest and confinement of the petitioners upon the information of the  fiscal  is  squarely before us.  If it had no such jurisdiction,  the petitioners are illegally deprived of their liberty  and  are entitled to be released upon <em>habeas corpus<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>The first section of Act No. 1773 provides:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"SECTION 1. Hereafter the crimes of <em>adulterio, estupro, rapto, violacion, calumnia, and injuria,<\/em> as defined by the Penal Code of the Philippine Islands, shall be deemed to be public crimes and shall be prosecuted in the same manner as are all  other  crimes defined by  said Penal Code or by the Acts of the Philippine  Commission: <em>Provided, however,<\/em> That no prosecution for the crimes of <em>adulterio, estupro, or injuria<\/em> committed  against  persons other than  public officials or employees shall  be  instituted except  upon the complaint of the  aggrieved person or of the parents, grandparents, or guardian of such person.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>It can not be determined from the word \"committed,\" as used in the above section,  whether it is singular or plural, as it is spelled the same in  both forms.  This past participle might refer to all three of  the crimes or just the latter only. Grammatically speaking, this  can not be definitively and with certainty  determined.  In the Spanish text, it  is used in the plural form (<em>cometidos<\/em>).<\/p>\n<p>To determine the question whether or not the crimes of adultery and seduction, when committed against public officers and employees can be instituted  and carried forward to a final determination upon  the information of the provincial fiscal alone, we must look  to the intent of the Legislature.<\/p>\n<p>Prior to the passage of Act No. 1773 the  crimes of adulery and seduction were purely private offenses and could not be  prosecuted except, for  the  first crime, upon the complaint of the offended husband, and for the second, upon  the complaint of the offended party or her parents, grandparents, or  guardian.  The prosecuting officer  had no authority to institute the proceedings in either one of these cases, while, on  the  other hand,  it was not  necessary in every instance  that there  should  be a complaint filed by the injured party before a person could be prosecuted for the crime  of injuria.  In other  words, there were two classes of insults.  Those  directed against  private parties which could not be prosecuted <em>de oficio <\/em>or on the initiative and through  the  public prosecutor,  and those against the authorities,  public officials,  or  agents of the  authorities which were real public crimes  and which could be prosecuted  by the  prosecuting officer the same as other public offenses.<\/p>\n<p>There existed sound reasons  of public  policy which forbade the prosecution of persons charged with the crimes of adultery and  seduction except  upon the  complaint of the aggrieved person or of the parents, grandparents, or guardian  of such person.  There also  existed  the same reason which prohibited  the  institution of criminal  proceedings against a person charged with insults except upon the complaint of the  aggrieved person  when such person was not one  of the  excepted classes., The Philippine  Commission intended that  these underlying principles of the Penal Code should remain in  force.   By Act No. 1773  these  offenses were made public crimes and the control of the prosecution of the same was taken out of  the  hands of the offended parties when  the  proceedings  were once  instituted.  The Commission realized that when public officials or employees were attacked, the  Government  was, to some extent, interested, and found it necessary to authorize its  prosecuting officers to go forward upon  their own initiative in cases of injnria without being compelled to await the filing of a complaint by  the offended party.  And again, if a public official or employee is insulted when he is in fche performance of his duty and  he  fails to come forward with the proper complaint,  it might  be necessary,  in  certain cases, to have the whole affair judicially investigated for the benefit of the  service. In  order to do this, it was thought advisable  to confer authority  upon  the  prosecuting  officer to institute criminal proceedings. This is not true, however, in reference to the crimes of adultery and seduction, even though the offended parties be public officials or employees. The  nature and character of the crimes are  distinctly different.  In  the first  class  (adultery  and seduction)  the Government has no special interest, while in  the second (<em>injuria<\/em>), the Government is interested to the  extent that one of  its officials or employees is involved.  So it  is clear that  criminal  proceedings  can not be  instituted  against persons charged with the crimes of adultery and seduction, although  the  offended  parties may be  public officials or employees, except upon the complaint of the offended party or (in the case of seduction) her parents, grandparents, or guardian.  While, on the other hand, the prosecuting officer can  institute, upon his own  initiative,  a criminal action against a  person charged with insults when the  offended party is a public official or employee and in the performance of his duty when such insults were uttered.<\/p>\n<p>The word  \"committed\" as  used in the first section of Act  No.  1773 is  singular in form, and  the same word in the Spanish text  should be changed accordingly.<\/p>\n<p>In the case at bar the criminal proceedings were instituted against the petitioner in the  court of  the justice  of the peace upon a complaint of the offended  husband.   He had a perfect  right to commence that action.  In fact, he was the only one who could do so.  The justice  of the peace, after making a preliminary investigation, found that there did not exist  reasonable  cause to believe that an offense had  been  committed, and that the accused parties were guilty thereof.  He thereupon dismissed the complaint and discharged the defendants.  This definitively and  finally terminated that case.  The  offended party could have presented another complaint for the same offense, charging the defendants with the same crime,  if he had so desired.   He having failed  to  do this, the case, as we have said,  was terminated as far as the whole world was concerned.  The fiscal was without  authority to institute in  the Court of First Instance  a  new proceeding by filing an information. The filing of this  information gave the court no jurisdiction whatever  over  the persons of the petitioners  and  the subject matter of the action.   In order to give the court jurisdiction over the persons of the petitioners and the subject matter of the action, it was necessary that  the complaint defined by section 4 of General Orders, No. 58, be made and executed in writing by the offended party personally; such jurisdiction could be acquired in no other way.

He is the  issue  of the legal marriage of  a  Chinese woman of  the full  blood to a  Eurasian\u2014that is,  a  person of mixed European and Asiatic  blood\u2014with no  admixture of Chinese.   At the time of his  emigration he was a resident of the British concession of Amoy, China.   His father is and has always been a British subject, with no Chinese blood, and the paternal grandparents of the petitioner  were at one time  citizens of the United States born therein.  The father's name is Frank Hugh Edwards and  the mother's name is Lian Niu.  The petitioner was born in  the British concession in Amoy and resided there  at the time of  his emigration.  The board of special inquiry denied him the  right to enter on the ground that he was a person  of Chinese race and descent by reason of the fact that his mother was a Chinese woman of the full blood.<\/p>\n<p>The attorney for the respondent objected to  the jurisdiction of this court, under the facts and  circumstances presented, to inquire  into the correctness  of the decision of the board of special inquiry.  This court  has already many times  held that the decision of the administrative officers upon  the question  of the right of  an alien to  enter the Philippine Islands  is final where  no  abuse of authority of any kind is shown.   (Ngo-Ti <em>vs.<\/em> Shuster, 7 Phil. Rep., 355; Juan Co <em> vs.<\/em> Rafferty,  14 Phil. Rep. 235;  U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Ju Toy, 198 U. S., 253; Pearson <em>vs.<\/em> Williams, 202 U. S,, 281; Chin  Yow <em>vs.<\/em> U. S., 208  U. S., 8.)   It is urged that a  hearing  having been  given  the  alien by the board  of special inquiry, its  decision,   whether  for or against,  is not reviewable  by the  courts  in the absence  of abuse  of discretion.   This, generally speaking, is true, as is clearly stated  and fully held by the cases above  cited.  It is also urged  that no  abuse of authority  or discretion  by the board  in the case before us has been shown.<\/p>\n<p>It is unquestioned that an alien seeking to enter United States  territory is entitled to a hearing before he is denied such entrance.   What is a hearing within the  meaning of the law?  Generally  speaking, it may be said  to  be an opportunity given to  the alien to  present his case; to adduce his evidence tending to establish  the rights which he  asserts.  But, in  reality,  it is  something more.  He is  not  only entitled  to  present his .evidence but he is also entitled to have it considered.   The object of a hearing is  as much to have evidence considered  as it  is to present it.  The right to adduce  evidence, without the corresponding duty on the part of the board  to consider it, is vain.  Such right is conspicuously futile  if the person or  persons to whom the evidence is presented  can thrust it aside without notice or consideration.   The body to which the law permits the presentation of  evidence is undoubtedly  designed by  that law  to  be a deliberative body.   Deliberation is its  chief function.  Withdraw that attribute and it becomes  an aggregation  of individuals, governed  by no evidence, ruled  by no  conditions, dedicated  to no purpose, bound by  no rights, and amenable to no law.  A  body  designed by law to be deliberative which declines  to deliberate  abdicates  its functions and its decisions are entitled  to no  more  consideration than if made with no hearing at all.   While the duty to deliberate  does not  impose the obligation to decide  right, it does imply a necessity which cannot be disregarded, namely, that of  having something  to support its decision.  While the decision  of such a body does not  have to  be right to be effective and final, it.must, nevertheless, have something upon which it is based; there must have been something  upon which. the deliberative function of  the board acted, A. verdict or  decision with absolutely  nothing  to support  it is  a nullity, at least  when  directly attacked, and a body which affirms such a decision does not exercise either deliberative discretion or authority.   The same may be said of a finding which is in plain and open contradiction of the conceded  and  admitted facts of the case.   If all the parties to the  controversy concede that  the  person seeking  admission is  not  a  Chinese person or a  person of Chinese descent but is an English  person of English descent  and that is  the  only evidence before  the  board, a decision that  such  a person is riot entitled to enter is an arbitrary and not a deliberative act, has nothing whatever to  support it, and while it  might fall within what is  called abuse  of discretion or  authority, it  is not  so much an abuse as it is  an entire absence of discretion  of any sort.   It is rather an abdication of functions  than  an abusive use of powers.  If a  board, stating the  facts upon which it proposes to rest  its decision, draws a  conclusion from those facts legally impossible from any point of view, the drawing  of  such  a conclusion is an arbitrary act, an abuse of discretion, and  wholly  without authority.  This means, really and in substance, that there was no hearing. Under such  circumstances this court has jurisdiction to review.<\/p>\n<p>We are of the opinion, however, that this condition does not exist in this  case.   The facts in this case are conceded. The board has  presented them  as hereinabove  detailed as the basis of its decision.  Upon those facts the finding is  made  that the petitioner  herein is a Chinese  person, or a person  of  Chinese descent,  within the meaning of the laws of  Congress  prohibiting the entrance  of such person into the territory of the United States.   We are of the opinion that that  finding must stand.   The  phrase \"Chinese person or person of Chinese descent,\"  as used in  the Act of Congress,  is  very broad; and,  under the rules pertaining  to the finality of the decisions of the immigration authorities  on such  questions  as laid down  by the Federal courts, we do not feel that we are warranted in  disturbing the conclusions reached in this case.  The conclusion that the petitioner is a person of Chinese descent is not devoid  of  foundation.<\/p>\n<p>We  have read with the interest and care  the ably expressed contention of counsel for petitioner that the quantity of  blood  which one has in his veins, if he is less than the  full  blood, has nothing to  do with the determination of  his race; that the  race to  which one belongs depends upon the race of the father and  that that of the mother has no influence  in that determination.  Counsel call our attention to the case of Ex parte Reynolds, Federal Cases, No. 11719,  which they  rely upon as decisive in the case before us.<\/p>\n<p>We can not  bring ourselves to agree with this contention. Quite different rules of  law govern the question in  hand. The rules which the court applied in the case cited spring from different conditions  and  are  formed by principles different  from those which govern  the  case before  us. There the matter dealt with was the jurisdiction of courts over persons within the territory of the United States and subject  to  its  sovereignty.  Here  we  are concerned  with the immigration of aliens into the territory of the United States.  There  the question  was  one  of personal rights. Here it is  one   of international rights.  There  the  question was purely judicial.   Here it is executive and administrative.   The  principles and rules applicable in one case may be  applicable only in small part to the other.<\/p>\n<p>The application for the writ is denied.<\/p>\n<p><em> Arellano, C.

Gale, judge.<p> About 10 o'clock on the night of one of the last days of the month of November,\u00a0 1910, Pedro Cabigting,\u00a0 a <em>curandero,<\/em> who was in a house situated in the barrio of Bagbaguin, pueblo of Caloocan, in which he was attending\u00a0 a patient, heard a voice, which apparently came from\u00a0 the neighboring\u00a0 house of Macario Domingo, utter the words: \"<em>Jesus, Maria y Jose,<\/em> pardon me.\"\u00a0\u00a0 He therefore immediately\u00a0 left the house, with the intention of going to that of the said\u00a0 neighbor,\u00a0 as he was aware that the latter's wife was also\u00a0 sick, and\u00a0 when he was near the yard of Domingo's house\u00a0 he also heard a groan, and upon getting near the yard, he saw, in the <em>zaguan<\/em> or on the ground under the house, a person\u00a0 stretched out and around him the master of the house, Macario Domingo, and the men Pedra Mauricio and\u00a0 Celestino Ramirez, whom he knew previously, even to their voices.\u00a0 At this moment Mauricio, addressing Domingo, said to him: \"Why have you treated him so?\"\u00a0 To which Domingo replied:\u00a0 \"It is because this son\u00a0 of a b_______ would not\u00a0 cease making love to my daughter.\"\u00a0 Then Mauricio replied, saying: \"Since you have done that, it would be better to kill him outright;\" and Celestino Ramirez, joining in the conversation, said:\u00a0 \"Nothing can now\u00a0 be done but to finish him and conceal him in\u00a0 order that it may not get to the public and\u00a0 cause\u00a0 us trouble.\" After the curandero, Pedro Cabigting, had heard these\u00a0 statements, he returned to the house whence he had come.<\/p><p> Several days afterwards, the date not appearing in the record, Julian Cleofas, a brother of Doroteo Cleofas, who had disappeared and was subsequently found to have been killed, found an anonymous\u00a0 letter\u00a0 on his\u00a0 gate, whereby, according to a neighbor who read it, he was informed that his brother had been murdered, as well as who his murderers were\u00a0 and where his corpse was buried.\u00a0 He therefore\u00a0 reported the matter to the police of Caloocan, and, in company with Lieutenant Dominador Aquino,\u00a0 Sergeant Indalecio Tan and some others, proceeded to make investigations to find the body and the perpetrators of the crime. They arrested Pedro Mauricio and Macario Domingo, as the reported perpetrators, and found, under the latter's house, dried blood stains covered with earth arid the strips of\u00a0 bamboo, which\u00a0 formed the floor of the said house, untied directly above the spot in the <em>zaguan<\/em> where the said blood stains were noticed.<\/p><p> After making several investigations, with the guidance of the contents of the aforementioned anonymous letter, they found, in a wood 120 meters\u00a0 away from the house of Macario Domingo, the place where the body of Doroteo Cleofas was buried, which, upon being exhumed in the presence of Julian Cleofas, was identified by the latter as that of his said brother, notwithstanding that it\u00a0 was in an advanced stage\u00a0 of\u00a0 decomposition, though it was observed that the skeleton was that of a male.\u00a0 It had a hemp cord wound around the wrist of the right hand, both thighs had fallen off througKUecomposition, the flesh was gone from the neck, and the legs and arms were doubled up.\u00a0 It was dressed in a white shirt and colored trousers.\u00a0 Such was the result, also, of the examination made by the physician who is the president of the board of health of the pueblo of Caloocan.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 From the facts before related it is concluded that Doroteo Cleofas was violently killed on the night of one of the last days of November, 1910, in the yard or <em>zaguan<\/em> the house of Macario Domingo; that afterwards his body was buried by his slayers in a neighboring wood 120 meters distant from the said house, in which place it was subsequently found by the public officers, about January 23 of the following year, Julian\u00a0 Cleofas,\u00a0 a brother of the deceased; being then and there present; and that the body of the deceased was identified by\u00a0 his said brother,\u00a0 notwithstanding the advanced stage of decomposition a\u00a0 professional examination showed it to be in.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 The acts constituting the crime in question were brought to light through the declarations of the curandero, Pedro Gaibigtingj who on the night of the\u00a0 occurrence saw a man stretched\u00a0 out on the ground, apparently dead, and heard the conversation among the perpetrators thereof, and also by the statements\u00a0 made by the alleged perpetrators thereof to the lieutenant and the sergeant of police pf Calooean, Dominador Aquino and Indalecio Tan. But as Macario Domingo died after judgment had been rendered in the case in first instance,\u00a0 and Pedro Mauricio, who was sentenced to life imprisonment,\u00a0 has not appealed,\u00a0 this decision shall only deal with the other two defendants, the appellants Regina Domingo and Celestino Ramirez, who were also sentenced, in the said judgment appealed from, to the penalty of twenty years of <em>reclusion temporal<\/em>. <br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 It is improper to hold upon the merits of the case that Regina Domingo took part in the\u00a0 violent death of the deceased Doroteb\u00a0 Cleofas, and\u00a0 to consider her guilty\u00a0 as a coprincipal\u00a0 or even as an accomplice in the crime under prosecution, merely from the testimony of the lieutenant of police, Dominador Aquino, to the effect that Regina Domingo revealed to him the fact that, in obedience to the orders; of her father, Macario Domingo, she had sent for and invited Doroteo Cleofas to the zaguan of her house on the night in question, and when he entered the place she had to strike him with a bolo\u00a0 she had ready, and\u00a0 that as soon as\u00a0 the assaulted man Cleofas fell to the ground, her father, who was on watch, and\u00a0 a brother of his, came down out of\u00a0 the house, immediately set upon the\u00a0 victim and\u00a0 finally killed him.\u00a0\u00a0 Such testimony as to statements attributed to\u00a0 the defendant Regina Domingo is insufficient in itself alone to determine her guilt, as it is not supported nor corroborated by any other evidence, or even by any circumstantial fact tending to produce in the mind full conviction of her guilt.<\/p><p> She absolutely\u00a0 denies the charge and the acts attributed to her.\u00a0 The circumstance, that she was\u00a0 the sweetheart of the deceased, or that the latter was courting\u00a0 her,\u00a0 is not a sufficient reason to hpld her to be a coprincipal\u00a0 in the killing of the deceased.\u00a0 Pedro Cabigting, who went to the scene of the crime when it\u00a0 had just\u00a0 been committed\u00a0 and\u00a0 testified that he saw the persons then around\u00a0 the assaulted party, who was apparently dying or dead, has not revealed whether the defendant Regina\u00a0 Domingo\u00a0 was\u00a0 also present there. Besides the\u00a0 testimony\u00a0 of the lieutenant of police,\u00a0 Aquino, who declared that Regina made to him the statements before related, the record\u00a0 furnishes no\u00a0 other fact,\u00a0 even circumstantial,\u00a0 in corroboration of such statements,\u00a0 denied abso- lutely by the\u00a0 defendant, to\u00a0 whom they were attributed. Neither her father,\u00a0 when alive, nor the other defendant, Pedro Mauricio, made\u00a0 the slightest mention of her having taken part in the crime, and had she known of its perpetration, on the\u00a0 supposition that she was in her father's house that night as well as when they buried the victim's body in an adjoining wood,\u00a0 such facts could not serve as\u00a0 grounds for her incrimination\u00a0 or responsibility,\u00a0 for even\u00a0 on that\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 hypothesis she was not obliged to report the occurrence to the authorities, nor was she responsible for her silence, on account of the kinship between\u00a0 herself and the\u00a0 principal alleged perpetrator of the crime.\u00a0\u00a0 (Art. 16, Penal Code.)<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 In view of the fact that Celestino Ramirez denies the charge absolutely, as well jis any participation\u00a0 in the criminal act, the mere testimony of the curandero, Pedro Cabig,- ting, is not sufficient evidence whereupon to find him guilty as a Joprincipal or even\u00a0 as\u00a0 an accomplice, for the reason that the testimony of this sole witness for the prosecution does\u00a0 not appear in the record to be corroborated by\u00a0 any other evidence, even, circumstantial, of the guilt\u00a0 of\u00a0 the defendant Ramirez,\u00a0 against whom,\u00a0 moreover,\u00a0 there is no other incriminating evidence, even from the policemen who searched for him to arrest him.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 Were it permissible for us to take up the matter of the responsibility of Macario Domingo and Pedro Mauricio, we might perhaps\u00a0 be able to show how the testimony of the policemen who arrested them would be admissible and effective against them; but with respect to the defendants Regina and Ramirez, especially the former, it is neither proper nor just to admit such\u00a0 testimony\u00a0 as\u00a0 proof, for the reasons before stated.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 Section 57 of General Orders,\u00a0 No. 58, prescribes that a defendant in a criminal action shall be presumed to be innocent until the contrary is proved, and in case\u00a0 of reasonable doubt that his guilt is satisfactorily shown he shall be entitled to an acquittal. This legal precept, perfectly rational and just, being applied in behalf of the defendants, Regina Domingo and Celestino Ramirez,\u00a0 they must be acquitted, for the want of satisfactory and conclusive proof of their guilt. <\/p><p> In view of the nature of this finding and of the fact that of the two defendants found guilty in\u00a0 the judgment\u00a0 appealed from, one of them, Pedro Mauricio, acquiesced in his sentence and is serving it out at the present time, and the other has died, it would be\u00a0 futile to discuss whether\u00a0 the crime under prosecution should be classified as murder or as simple homicide and whether any circumstance qualifying the crime attended the commission thereof.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 For the foregoing reasons we are of opinion that the judgment appealed from should be reversed with\u00a0 reference- toi the defendants Regina Domingo and Celestino Ramirez, and they should be and are hereby acquitted, with two-fourths of the costs of both instances <em>de oficio<\/em>,\u00a0 and they shall immediately\u00a0 be released through\u00a0 an order to\u00a0 the\u00a0 Director of Prisons, unless held on some other charge.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/><em>Arellano, C.\u00a0 J., Mapa,\u00a0 Johnson, Carson,<\/em> and <em>Trent, JJ<\/em>., concur.<br\/><\/p><\/div>",

Powell, judge of the Court of First Instance at\u00a0 Iloilo, condemning him to one year and one day of <em>presidio\u00a0 correccional<\/em>, to the payment of P1,000 to the heirs\u00a0 of the\u00a0 deceased, Ponciano Leal,\u00a0 to\u00a0 the\u00a0 corresponding subsidiary\u00a0 imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to the payment of the costs of the cause, for the crime of negligent homicide (<em>imprudencia temeraria\u00a0 con homicidio<\/em>).<p>It is admitted that Ponciano Leal was killed on the public highway while going from the town of Pavia to Santa Barbara, Province of Iloilo, at about 4 o'clock on the afternoon of April\u00a0 23, 1911, by\u00a0 being struck by\u00a0 an automobile, of which the appellant was the chauffeur.\u00a0\u00a0 The contention of the prosecution is that the death of the deceased was due to the reckless driving of the appellant, while counsel for the\u00a0 defense\u00a0 insists\u00a0 that the unfortunate occurrence\u00a0 was purely an accident.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 prosecution presented four\u00a0 witnesses and the defense six, including the appellant. <\/p><p>The first witness, Pedro\u00a0 Latoja, 18\u00a0 years of\u00a0 age, an ordinary\u00a0 laborer, a resident of\u00a0 Lambunao, testified that Juan Labrila, Ponciano Leal,\u00a0 and he, were walking abreast along the road toward Santa Barbara on the afternoon in question; that he was in the middle with Leal on his right and Labrila on his left; that while they were going along in this manner\u00a0 carrying on an ordinary conversation,\u00a0 he heard\u00a0 a noise behind him, and on turning around saw\u00a0 an automobile approaching; that\u00a0 he called\u00a0 out\u00a0 immediately that an automobile\u00a0 was coming and jumped to the left, colliding with Labrila; that when he turned around to look for Leal the\u00a0 latter was lying on the ground,\u00a0 having been knocked down by the automobile, and\u00a0 that at that place the road was higher than the adjacent land for a considerable distance each way.\u00a0 The testimony of this witness is corroborated\u00a0 by that of Juan Labrila in every particular. Labrila also\u00a0 testified that\u00a0 he was knocked into the ditch on\u00a0 the left of the road by Latoja\u00a0 and that\u00a0 when he got up he saw Leal lying on the ground, the automobile having passed.\u00a0 Nicolas Agraviado testified that he had just passed the\u00a0 deceased and his companions\u00a0 going in\u00a0 the opposite direction when the automobile passed him; that on account of its\u00a0 speed\u00a0 he started to\u00a0 turn around to watch it, but when he had\u00a0 done so the machine had passed Leal and his companions and he saw Leal lying on the ground.\u00a0 The last witness presented by the prosecution was Petronio Leal, son\u00a0 of the deceased.\u00a0 He\u00a0 was\u00a0 walking a little ahead\u00a0 of his father when the latter was struck by the\u00a0 machine. This witness\u00a0 did not see the machine strike the deceased, neither did either of the\u00a0 other three witnesses see Leal at the\u00a0 precise moment he was struck.<\/p><p>The\u00a0 defense introduced the testimony\u00a0 of the members\u00a0 of the party riding in the automobile, namely, Henry J. Becker, Charles C. Dean, W.\u00a0 H. Rimmer, Garret\u00a0 A. Hardwood, and Joseph Miller, and that of the chauffeur.<\/p><p>Becker testified that he saw some\u00a0 men in the road at a distance of about 300 yards\u00a0 ahead of the automobile; that\u00a0 at that time the\u00a0 chauffeur put on his brakes, used his exhaust, and blew his horn; that when they got up to within about 30 feet of the men - some of them having gone to the right and some to the left\u00a0 the deceased, being\u00a0 on the right, started to run\u00a0 across to the left side of the\u00a0 road\u00a0 to join his companions; that the deceased did not clear the machine and was struck by some part of the left side of the machine, knocked down, and died soon thereafter.\u00a0\u00a0 This witness further testified that at the time of the occurrence the machine was going at a \"pretty fair speed;\" and that the impact of the machine against the deceased raised him (witness)\u00a0 from his seat.\u00a0\u00a0 The following questions and answers appear in the transcript of this\u00a0 witness' testimony:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"Q. You could not see the deceased at the time he was hit from the\u00a0 place where\u00a0 you were sitting, could you? -\u00a0 A. I don't see why I couldn't.\u00a0 I was standing up like this. (Indicating a half-sitting posture.)\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"Q. There were other people in front of you and there is a glass in front of the automobile and yet you say you could see? - A.\u00a0 I could see\u00a0 a clear road ahead except this man in\u00a0 the ditch on the right-hand side.\u00a0\u00a0 I paid particular attention because I was\u00a0 looking that way.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"Q. Do you know how fast\u00a0 the automobile was going at the time the man was hit? - A.

This was the first time that Latoja had been in the\u00a0 city of Iloilo\u00a0 for\u00a0 ten years.\u00a0 Latoja and Labrila told a\u00a0 plain, simple story.\u00a0 They were walking along the road abreast, Latoja heard a\u00a0 noise,\u00a0 looked back, and called out\u00a0 that an automobile was approaching.\u00a0 He then jumped to\u00a0 the\u00a0 left to get out of the way of the machine, colliding with Labrila and knocking him\u00a0 into the\u00a0 ditch on\u00a0 the\u00a0 left-hand side. Becker says\u00a0 that he saw a man in the ditch on the right side.\u00a0 There is nothing else in the record to show that there was any other person\u00a0 in the ditch\u00a0 on either side.\u00a0\u00a0 All\u00a0 the witnesses for the\u00a0 defense testified that the\u00a0 middle of\u00a0 the road was clear at that place\u00a0 and\u00a0 time and that the deceased, as well as all others, were in perfectly safe places and that the deceased\u00a0 would not have been killed if he had\u00a0 not attempted to cross from, the right to the left side of the road. These facts show that Becker, was mistaken when he stated that he saw a man in the ditch on the\u00a0 right side.\u00a0 Labrila was in the ditch on the left side.\u00a0\u00a0 Becker also says that the machine was\u00a0 about 300 yards from the man when the chauffeur put on his brakes, and that putting on the brakes raised him in his seat, meaning that the application of the brakes checked the machine so suddenly that he was thrown forward.\u00a0 Again,\u00a0 he\u00a0 says\u00a0 that he was in\u00a0 a\u00a0 half-sitting posture at the time the deceased made a dash\u00a0 for the left side of\u00a0 the road, and also that the impact of the machine against the deceased raised him from his seat.\u00a0\u00a0 The result is that Becker was raised in his seat when the brakes were put on, some 300 yards away.\u00a0\u00a0 He either remained standing or sat down and got up again, as he was standing when the machine was within about thirty feet of the deceased.\u00a0 He must have sat down before the machine ran the 30 feet, as he was raised from his seat when the collision took place. Again, Becker says that the machine was going about 20 miles an hour when the brakes were first applied with great force, yet it ran about 300 yards with the brakes on, and after going that distance it still had sufficient momentum to strike the deceased with such force as to fatally injure him.<\/p><p>Dean says that the machine was about 300 yards away from the deceased and his companions when the defendant blew his\u00a0 horn, turned\u00a0 on\u00a0 the exhaust and shut\u00a0 off the power; that when they were about 25 feet away the brakes were applied with such force that he and his\u00a0 companions were all thrown forward, and that the machine had been running when it struck the\u00a0 deceased under its own momentum for about 150 or 200 yards.\u00a0\u00a0 The defendant says that when he was about 80\u00a0 or\u00a0 100 yards away he cut off the gasoline, blew his horn, and put his foot on the exhaust, that when he was within about 4 or 6 yards (2 or 3 <em>brazas<\/em>) the deceased made a dash for the other side and he then put on the brakes; that at\u00a0 that time he was going 6 or 8 miles an hour; and that the machine ran about 3 or 4 <em>brazas<\/em> after hitting the. deceased before he could stop it.<\/p><p>According to Becker, the impact of the machine against the,deceased was so hard that he was raised in his\u00a0 seat, notwithstanding the fact that the\u00a0 brakes\u00a0 had been applied with great force 300 yards away.\u00a0\u00a0 According to Dean, the brakes were applied with force\u00a0 25 feet away and the machine had been running under its own momentum for about 150 or 200 yards when the deceased was struck.\u00a0 According to the defendant,\u00a0 the machine had been\u00a0 running without gasoline\u00a0 for about 100 yards and\u00a0 the brakes\u00a0 were applied when he was about 18 feet from the deceased.\u00a0 All agree, however, that the deceased was struck on the left hip by the fender or lamp with such force that he died within a short time thereafter, and that the machine did\u00a0 not pass over his body.<\/p><p>Taking the\u00a0 statement of\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant\u00a0 himself, the machine had been going for 100\u00a0 yards without gasoline, 18 feet of the last part of the hundred yards with the brakes strongly\u00a0 applied,\u00a0 when the deceased was\u00a0 struck, and continued for some 25 feet before he could stop.\u00a0 That so fatal results could have been accomplished by the automobile without passing over the body of the deceased under these circumstances,\u00a0 we think highly\u00a0 improbable,\u00a0 if not impossible.\u00a0\u00a0 In view of all the admitted\u00a0 facts and circumstances, and the\u00a0 unreasonableness of\u00a0 the\u00a0 stories\u00a0 told by the defendant and his witnesses we are fully\u00a0 satisfied\u00a0 that the trial court was justified in accepting the\u00a0 testimony of Latoja, Labrila, and Agraviado as to how the collision took place.\u00a0 This being true, the deceased was killed just a little to the left\u00a0 of\u00a0 the center\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 road.\u00a0\u00a0 Just before the machine struck him he had been walking\u00a0 abreast\u00a0 with his companions.\u00a0 Neither Latoja nor\u00a0 Labrila heard the blowing of the horn orjiny other\u00a0 warning whatever until the machine\u00a0 was so close that Latoja\u00a0 and Labrila barely had time to make their escape, while the deceased, being on the left, did\u00a0 not have sufficient time.\u00a0\u00a0 The road\u00a0 at the place where the collision took place was about 24\u00a0 feet wide,\u00a0 a little higher than\u00a0 the adjacent country, and\u00a0 clear of obstacles which might obstruct the view, for quite a long distance each way.<\/p><p>Now, do these facts constitute a violation of article 568 of the Penal Code?\u00a0 This article reads:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"ART. 568. Any person who by reckless imprudence shall commit any act which, had it been intentional, would constitute a grave felony shall suffer a penalty ranging from <em>arresto mayor<\/em> in its maximum\u00a0 degree\u00a0 to\u00a0 <em>prision correccional<\/em> in its minimum degree; if it would have constituted a\u00a0 less grave felony, the\u00a0 penalty of <em>arresto mayor<\/em> in its minimum and medium degree shall be imposed.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Counsel for the\u00a0 appellant insists that the court erred, first,\u00a0 in taking\u00a0 judicial notice of\u00a0 the power\u00a0 of\u00a0 stopping appliances of automobiles; and second, in its conception of reckless negligence as applied to the rights\u00a0 of vehicles and parties on foot on public highways.<\/p><p>In support of the first assignment of error, counsel cites that part of\u00a0 the decision appealed from\u00a0 wherein the court says:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"Everybody knows that all first-class cars turned out at the shops have appliances that will stop a\u00a0 machine going at 15 miles an hour within 5 feet.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>It is true that there is nothing in the evidence to warrant this statement or deduction.\u00a0\u00a0 But this was\u00a0 a casual observation made by the court, and did not form\u00a0 the basis upon which\u00a0 the judgment rests.\u00a0 If this statement\u00a0 of the trial court were material, it might constitute a reversible error. It has been held, however, that courts\u00a0 will take judicial notice that an automobile makes an unusual noise; that it can be driven at a great velocity at a speed\u00a0 many times greater than that of ordinary vehicles drawn\u00a0 by\u00a0 animals, and that it is highly dangerous when used on country roads.

Watson (216 Mo., 420), the\u00a0 court said:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"Individuals as well as corporations in the use and operation\u00a0 of dangerous machines, should have a due regard to the preservation of the rights of the public in the use of the public streets, as well as the protection of persons using such streets\u00a0 from injury, and\u00a0 if\u00a0 they fail in\u00a0 this,\u00a0 and should in the operation of a vehicle which is always attended with\u00a0 more or less danger, negligently, carelessly and recklessly destroy human life,it is but in keeping with the proper and\u00a0 impartial\u00a0 administration of\u00a0 justice that the penalties should be suffered\u00a0 for the commission of such acts.<\/p><\/blockquote><p>In the case reported in volume 53 of the Criminal Jurisprudence of the\u00a0 supreme court\u00a0 of Spain, p. 157 (decision of October 1, 1894), it appeared that the driver of a public vehicle attempted to pass a street car and for that purpose turned to the right.\u00a0 In doing\u00a0 so he collided with an omnibus moving in the opposite direction, the vehicle striking the omnibus in front.\u00a0 As\u00a0 a result one\u00a0 of the passengers who\u00a0 was on the front platform of the omnibus and who had one of his legs sticking out from the side of the omnibus was injured.\u00a0 It was held that the\u00a0 defendant was guilty of reckless negligence for the reason\u00a0 that the collision\u00a0 was the result of his violation of the\u00a0 municipal\u00a0 ordinance under which he should\u00a0 have turned to the left instead of turning to the right,\u00a0 thereby attempting to pass between the curb\u00a0 of tne street and the omnibus,\u00a0 where there was hardly room enough\u00a0 for both vehicles between the sidewalk and the street car.<\/p><p>In\u00a0 the case reported in volume 22 of the Criminal Jurisprudence\u00a0 of the\u00a0 same court, page 84 (decision of January\u00a0 20, 1880), the crime was homicide committed through \"reckless\u00a0 negligence.\"\u00a0 It appears\u00a0 from the\u00a0 findings of the court that the\u00a0 defendant, together with\u00a0 some friends, was horseback riding; that as\u00a0 soon as\u00a0 they reached the public highway they spurred their horses into a hard gallop; that while going at such speed the defendant's horse struck a pack\u00a0 horse which was proceeding in the opposite direction;\u00a0 that as a result of the collision the packer, who was in the rear, was seriously injured, dying seven days later. The defendant knew that\u00a0 his horse\u00a0 was hardbitted and, therefore, rather difficult to control.\u00a0\u00a0 The supreme court of Spain\u00a0 held\u00a0 that such conduct\u00a0 on the\u00a0 part of the defendant showed \"reckless negligence\" on his part; and the fact that he saw the pack horse approaching and did not change his course, together with the fact that he knew that the horse he was riding was hardbitted and difficult to control, made such negligence all the\u00a0 more apparent The court further held that the fact\u00a0 that the deceased did not get\u00a0 out of the way when he saw the defendant approaching at such\u00a0 an unusual speed did not affect the latter's liability.<\/p><p>In the\u00a0 case\u00a0 reported in volume 73, Criminal Jurisprudence\u00a0 of\u00a0 said\u00a0 court,\u00a0 page 305\u00a0 (November 12, 1905), it appeared\u00a0 that\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant, who was driving a public vehicle at a short trot, ran over a boy six years old, fracturing one of his legs.\u00a0 It was proved that the defendant was not a duly licensed driver and had not had the six months' experience required by the rules relating\u00a0 to the registration of public drivers.\u00a0 It was alleged by the appellant that he did, not notice the boy, who just\u00a0 at\u00a0 that moment had run away from his sister by whom\u00a0 he\u00a0 was\u00a0 being led at the time.\u00a0\u00a0 The court held that appellant's failure to see the child,\u00a0 the fact that he gave no warning of his approach, and the fact that he\u00a0 was not a duly licensed driver with the necessary experience required by the rules, constituted reckless negligence and\u00a0 the\u00a0 judgment of\u00a0 conviction, was accordingly affirmed.<\/p><p>In the\u00a0 case\u00a0 reported in volume 33, Criminal Jurisprudence of the same court, page 545 (December 4, 1884), it appeared\u00a0 that\u00a0 the defendant, who was a tramcar driver, was driving his car apparently at an unusual rate of speed and while thus engaged collided with an\u00a0 omnibus which was moving in the opposite direction.\u00a0 As a result one of the passengers who was on the\u00a0 front platform of the omnibus fell to the ground and was run over by the tramcar, sustaining fracture of one of his legs and several other injuries.\u00a0 The supreme court, in sustaining the judgment of the trial court convicting the defendant of the crime of <em>lesiones graves<\/em> committed through reckless negligence, held that the fact that the defendant failed to stop his car or slacken its speed, so as to allow the omnibus to get off the car track,\u00a0 which the latter was trying to do, constituted reckless negligence.<\/p><p>The negligence of the defendant in the case at bar consisted in his failure to recognize the great injury that would accrue to the deceased from the collision.\u00a0 He had no right, it seems to us, after he saw the deceased and\u00a0 his companions walking in the road ahead\u00a0 of him to\u00a0 continue at so great a speed, at the eminent hazard of colliding with the deceased.\u00a0\u00a0 Great care was\u00a0 due from him by reason of the deadliness of the machine he was propelling along the highway.\u00a0 When one comes through the highways with a machine of such power as an automobile, it is incumbent upon the driver to use\u00a0 great care not to drive against or over pedestrians.\u00a0 An automobile is much more dangerous than a street car or even a railway car.\u00a0 These are propelled along fixed rails and all the traveling public has to\u00a0 do to be safe is to keep off the track.\u00a0\u00a0 But the automobile can be turned as easily as an\u00a0 individual, and for this reason is far more dangerous to the\u00a0 traveling public than either the street car or the railway train.\u00a0 We do not feel at liberty, under the evidence, to say that this defendant was free from reckless\u00a0 negligence.\u00a0 In failing to so\u00a0 check the speed of his machine when he saw the deceased in front of him to give him sufficient control to\u00a0 avert\u00a0 the injury or to stop it entirely, when he knew that if he\u00a0 continued at the same speed at which he was\u00a0 going he would\u00a0 collide with the deceased, not only shows negligence but reckless negligence in a marked degree.<\/p><p>The judgment appealed from being strictly in accordance with the law and merits of the case,\u00a0 the\u00a0 same is\u00a0 hereby affirmed with costs against\u00a0 the appellant.<\/p><p><em> Arellano, C, J., Torres, Mapa, Johnson,<\/em> and <em>Carson, JJ.<\/em>, concur.<\/p><\/div>",

Lobingier, judge, held that the claim based on the document submitted by the plaintiff on July 9, 1910, in administrative proceedings No. 1024\u00a0 and\u00a0 duplicated in case No. 7939,\u00a0 constitutes a\u00a0 legal claim against\u00a0 the\u00a0 estate\u00a0 of the said deceased, thereby admitting said\u00a0 claim and authorizing the administrator to pay it.<p>On\u00a0 October 20, 1910, counsel for the plaintiff, Guillermo F. Bowler, filed in the Court of First Instance of this city an\u00a0 amended complaint against the intestate estate of the deceased Matea Alvarez y\u00a0 Rubio, setting forth that the administration of the estate of said intestate is pending in Sala II of the court of this\u00a0 city under the old No.\u00a0 1025; that at the time\u00a0 of her death, and\u00a0 for many\u00a0 years\u00a0 prior thereto, the said Matea Alvarez y Rubio lived in the\u00a0 town of Capiz, province of the.same name; that she died a widow on\u00a0 May 26, 1897, intestate and leaving no heir by\u00a0 force of law, and therefore the Court of First Instance of Capiz immediately proceeded to provide for her intestate estate in accordance with\u00a0 article\u00a0 942 of the <em>Ley de\u00a0 Enjuiciamiento Civil<\/em> then in force; that the next day, that is, May 27,\u00a0 Marcos Arcenas, legitimate son of Maria Geronimo Rubio, appeared in the case and in the court with a power of attorney executed in his favor on that date by his mother, proving the latter's relationship\u00a0 to the deceased Matea Alvarez y Rubio within the fourth degree, as she was the aunt\u00a0 of\u00a0 the deceased Matea;\u00a0 that\u00a0 the court held\u00a0 such\u00a0 relationship to be proven and, in conformity with\u00a0 article 944 of the said <em>Ley<\/em>, ordered the delivery of all the property and effects, including the business and stock, belonging to the deceased to the said Marcos Arcenas in the character\u00a0 of\u00a0 representative of Maria Geronimo Rubio, all legal intervention ceasing on\u00a0 May\u00a0 31 of that year,\u00a0 1897; that in addition to Marcos Arcenas' mother there survived the deceased Matea Alvarez, Victorina Rubio and\u00a0 Manuel Rubio, uncle and aunt\u00a0 of the deceased and brother and sister\u00a0 of the said\u00a0 Maria\u00a0 Geronimo Rubio,' who then resided\u00a0 in the Island of Cebu, and who, in the month of the\u00a0 death\u00a0 of Matea Alvarez, executed\u00a0 powers of attorney in\u00a0 favor\u00a0 of the said\u00a0 Marcos Arcenas, so that he might represent them and look after their\u00a0 interests as heirs of the deceased; that as such representative of the three sole heirs of the deceased Matea Alvarez, Marcos Arcenas\u00a0 took over the business belonging to her and assumed possession of all the property, real and personal, and the live stock, of the intestate\u00a0 estate, until\u00a0 he\u00a0 was\u00a0 relieved in November,\u00a0 1900,\u00a0 by\u00a0 a judicial administrator appointed by the Court\u00a0 of First Instance\u00a0 of this city; that at 'the death of Matea Alvarez y Rubio her intestate succession had little ready cash and, in consequence of the revolution which a little while after her death spread to the Province of Capiz, Marcos Arcenas as administrator of the property and business of the deceased had to ask for extensions of time for the payment of the\u00a0 debts contracted by the deceased and to borrow various sums, to carry on the business\u00a0 she\u00a0 left, and to avert great damage to the interests of the three heirs he represented;

but\u00a0 the administrator appealed and this court, reversing the judgment of the court below, held that the intestate succession of said deceased was not\u00a0 obligated\u00a0 to pay the interest claimed by\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiff and merely sentenced\u00a0 said\u00a0 administration to pay 10,794.49 pesos Mexican with interest at the rate of 6 per cent a year from the date when the claim was presented to the commissioners.\u00a0 In view of this decision,\u00a0 the\u00a0 question\u00a0 regarding the\u00a0 payment of interest of 10\u00a0 per cent claimed by the plaintiff\u00a0 has already\u00a0 been discussed and definitely decided in a final decision rendered by a competent court and is res adjudicata.\u00a0\u00a0 To carry out that decision of the Supreme Court the defendant on July 9, 1910,\u00a0 deposited with\u00a0 the clerk of the Court of First Instance the sum of P11,384.12 Philippine currency, which represents the amount to which the plaintiff is entitled, with interest at the rate of 6 per cent a year, according to that decision of the Supreme Court, and it was necessary to make said deposit because the plaintiff refused to accept the amount offered by the defendant under that decision, although\u00a0 subsequent to the date of the deposit counsel for the plaintiff took from the clerk, on account of the claim, the sum of P8,000 Philippine currency.\u00a0 In order to\u00a0 base his action for the collection of interest at the rate of 10 per\u00a0 cent\u00a0 a\u00a0 year on the\u00a0 document\u00a0 dated March 5,\u00a0 1899, signed by Marcos Arcenas in his own behalf and as representative\u00a0 of the heirs of Maria Geronimo Rubio, the plaintiff should proceed against the said Marcos Arcenas and the heirs of the said Maria Geronimo Rubio, or against all the heirs of the deceased Matea Alvarez Rubio and not against the latter.\u00a0 On the hypothesis that the extension for the payment of the principal owed by the deceased Matea Alvarez y Rubio has been beneficial to the administration of her property, a fact which the defendant expressly denies, then the plaintiff should present a petition to the Honorable A.

Crossfield, judge,\u00a0 who is familiar with the orders of said\u00a0 administration, requesting that, after investigation of the validity and admissibility of the claim for payment of interest of 10 per cent\u00a0 and for the value of the 252 demijohns, he\u00a0 order the payment of said interest\u00a0 and the value of the demijohns, which should be charged, as expenses of administration.\u00a0 Wherefore his\u00a0 action in the form\u00a0 presented,\u00a0 or\u00a0 a separate\u00a0 suit against the intestate estate of the deceased Matea\u00a0 Alvarez y Rubio,\u00a0 would be improper, and therefore the defendant begs that the administration of the\u00a0 property\u00a0 of\u00a0 this\u00a0 deceased be absolved from the amended complaint presented in this\u00a0 case, with the costs against the plaintiff.<\/p><p>After trial and examination of the evidence submitted by both parties, the court on September 22, 1911, rendered judgment declaring that the claim presented by the plaintiff against the property of the deceased Matea Alvarez y Rubio was\u00a0 legal\u00a0 and therefore allowed and the\u00a0 administrator authorized\u00a0 to pay it, with\u00a0 the costs.<\/p><p>The defendant\u00a0 excepted to this judgment and asked for a new\u00a0 hearing, which motion was denied by\u00a0 the court, whereupon the defendant excepted and\u00a0 filed the corresponding bill of exceptions, which was approved, certified and forwarded with the evidence to the clerk of this court.<\/p><p>The plaintiff sets up as the principal cause of action his claim for the payment\u00a0 of interest at the rate of 10 per cent a year compounded at the end of each year since November, 1900,\u00a0 on the balance of 15,497.36 pesos Mexican, according to the liquidation inserted in paragraph 15 of the complaint.<\/p><p>The defendant objected, averring that said claim for the payment of interest has already been discussed, adjudicated and finally decided by\u00a0 judgment of this court rendered in the suit entered by the same plaintiff, Guillermo F. Bowler, against the\u00a0 defendant\u00a0 Pastor Alcazar,\u00a0 as\u00a0 administrator of the property of the\u00a0 deceased Matea Alvarez Rubio, which judgment appears in 13 Phil. Rep., 282.\u00a0 Therein this court reversed the judgment appealed from and directed the Court of First Instance to render judgment allowing the plaintiff's claim for the sum of 10,794.49 pesos Mexican, reduced to Philippine currency, with interest at the rate of 6 per cent per annum from the date of the presentation of the claim by said plaintiff to the\u00a0 commissioners.<\/p><p>In the judgment reversed, the administration of the property of the\u00a0 deceased Alvarez was held to be liable\u00a0 for the payment of the principal and interest at the rate of 10 per cent a year and was sentenced to pay 27,072.25 pesos and interest thereon at 10 per cent a year from September, 1908.<\/p><p>So the\u00a0 question submitted to the court for decision is this: The contention between the plaintiff and counsel for the intestate succession of the deceased Matea\u00a0 Alvarez concerning interest on a certain sum which she owed at death having already been decided in its previous judgment, can the same question again arise in the present litigation?<\/p><p>In the said decision of this court, the following grounds were assigned as headnotes:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"The inclusion,\u00a0 in the amount for which a promissory note is given, of interest in advance of the maturity of the note, is not of itself sufficient\u00a0 evidence to prove an agreement to pay interest after maturity.<\/p><p>\"Commissioners appointed to\u00a0 hear claims\u00a0 against an estate of a deceased person have no\u00a0 authority to\u00a0 allow a claim which arose after the death\u00a0 of such\u00a0 person, as for example interest due on a promissory note by\u00a0 virtue of an agreement made by the creditor with one of the heirs.<\/p><p>\"When no agreement\u00a0 as to interest is made, the\u00a0 interest does not commence to run\u00a0 on\u00a0 loans\u00a0 not\u00a0 mercantile until some demand for payment is made.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The plea of <em>res adjudicata<\/em> in a subsequent\u00a0 suit may be supported by a judgment of execution in\u00a0 a\u00a0 preceding one, and is admissible, when identity of\u00a0 persons,\u00a0 things, and grounds of action exists in both suits,, requisites that must be present in common between the first suit already terminated by judgment of execution\u00a0 and the subsequent one in which judgment is pending\u00a0 as a result of the\u00a0 presentation in the second litigation of a\u00a0 complaint over the same thing, the allegation upon the same ground and between the same parties.<\/p><p>Every question decided by final\u00a0 judgment\u00a0 in litigation before the courts is held to be <em>res adjudicata<\/em> or, as rule 3&amp;, title 34,<em> partida<\/em> 7, says:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"Furthermore,\u00a0 we hold that a matter\u00a0 which has\u00a0 been adjudicated by a judgment\u00a0 that cannot be\u00a0 appealed from must be accepted as truth.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Therefore, a question which is <em>res adjudicata<\/em>, constitutes a legal truth, and\u00a0 every judgment\u00a0 or\u00a0 judicial decision against which no appeal lies is said to have become <em>res adjudicata,<\/em> as Law 19, title 22, of the seventh partida says:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"A complete judgment, justly rendered by the trial judge, has such great force that thenceforth the parties and their heirs are bound to submit thereto.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Article\u00a0 1252 of the Civil Code,\u00a0 paragraph 1, provides:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"In order that the presumption of the <em>res adjudicata<\/em> may be valid in\u00a0 another suit, it is necessary that, between the case decided by the sentence and that in which the\u00a0 same is invoked, there be the most\u00a0 perfect\u00a0 identity between the things,\u00a0 causes,\u00a0 and\u00a0 persons\u00a0 of the\u00a0 litigants, and their capacity as\u00a0 such.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The effect of a judgment or final order in a suit, outside of the cases enumerated in paragraph 1\u00a0 of section\u00a0 306 of the Code\u00a0 of Civil\u00a0 Procedure, is conclusive, according to paragraph 2, with\u00a0 reference to\u00a0 the subject matter of the litigation\u00a0 between the parties and their\u00a0 successors in interest who may litigate for the same thing, under the same title and in\u00a0 the same capacity.<\/p><p>The claim presented by the plaintiff to the commissioners appointed in the proceedings for administration of the property of the deceased intestate, Matea Alvarez, for the collec- tion not only of the principal owed, which is\u00a0 set forth in the\u00a0 said document\u00a0 of January\u00a0 10, 1896, but\u00a0 also\u00a0 for interest at the rate of 10 per cent a year allowed by\u00a0 said commissioners and affirmed by the Court of First Instance, has nevertheless been corrected\u00a0 by this\u00a0 court in its\u00a0 said decision of\u00a0 March 23, 1909, since it declared that, in addition to the principal, the defendant only owed interest at the rate of\u00a0 6\u00a0 per cent.\u00a0 But, notwithstanding this final judgment, the\u00a0 plaintiff, on October 20,1910, again instituted the present litigation, asking in his complaint that the court render judgment among other matters for the payment of the same\u00a0 interest at\u00a0 the rate of 10 per\u00a0 cent a year compounded at\u00a0 the end of each year from November 30. 1900, on the balance of 15,497.35 pesos Mexican.\u00a0 The suit having been\u00a0 tried and the representative\u00a0 of .the intestate succession of the deceased Matea Alvarez having been heard, the Court of First Instance rendered judgment on September 22, 1911, declaring that the\u00a0 plaintiff's claim is legal\u00a0 and authorizing the administrator to pay the amount thereof.<\/p><p>There can be no doubt that there exists identity of persons, things, and rights of action\u00a0 between the present\u00a0 suit and the previous one which was finally decided by this court. The previous suit, like the present, was instituted\u00a0 by the plaintiff,\u00a0 Guillermo F.\u00a0 Bowler, against the administrator of the property of the intestate\u00a0 Matea Alvarez; and the complaint upon which the\u00a0 present is\u00a0 based\u00a0 is directed against the same intestate\u00a0 succession.\u00a0 In that suit, as well as in this one now submitted to the decision of the\u00a0 court, interest was claimed on the principal the intestate owed at the. rate of 10 per cent a year, and for\u00a0 the\u00a0 same reason, that the payment\u00a0 of such\u00a0 interest at 10 per cent had been stipulated in the note quoted.<\/p><p>It cannot be denied that the right of action exercised in the previous suit is reproduced\u00a0 in the present,\u00a0 for each is based on\u00a0 the same cause and reason, to wit, stipulation for payment\u00a0 of interest at the rate of\u00a0 10\u00a0 per\u00a0 cent a year in the said note, so there\u00a0 can be no\u00a0 question that the\u00a0 requisites of identity of persons, things, and rights of action are present in common between the\u00a0 former\u00a0 suit, already terminated, and the one now pending in this second instance on appeal.\u00a0 Therefore, the question now raised in this suit has already been decided by final judgment in the former\u00a0 one and\u00a0 has acquired\u00a0 the authority of\u00a0 <em>res adjudicata<\/em>,\u00a0 and it would be improper to present a new complaint for collection of the same interest, already definitely decided,\u00a0 in order to be again tried and\u00a0 determined in this suit.<\/p><p>So it cannot be\u00a0 denied that there exists perfect identity of things, the interest claimed, between this case and that decided by the said judgment of this court; the causes, an alleged agreement for the\u00a0 payment of said interest\u00a0 at\u00a0 the rate of 10\u00a0 per cent a year; the litigants are the\u00a0 same parties\u00a0 as creditor and\u00a0 debtor.\u00a0 The apparent difference between the defendant in\u00a0 the said former suit\u00a0 decided by this court on appeal and the defendant in\u00a0 this suit is not an obstacle to sustaining the plea of <em>res adjudicata<\/em> herein; Pastor Alcazar was the defendant in that\u00a0 former suit, as administrator of the intestate\u00a0 succession of the deceased Matea Alvarez, and he represents said intestate\u00a0 succession herein as such administrator, in such wise\u00a0 that,\u00a0 in case of judgment, the only party responsible for the payment of the\u00a0 interest\u00a0 at 10 per cent, claimed\u00a0 by\u00a0 Bowler, would be the same\u00a0 intestate succession of the deceased Alvarez, especially when the principal debt was contracted by her when alive and to\u00a0 her is\u00a0 attributed,\u00a0 after her\u00a0 death, the agreement with the creditor to pay the interest at 10 per cent a year on the\u00a0 principal set forth in the said note, for it was not sustained in that suit terminated\u00a0 by a\u00a0 final judgment of execution; and\u00a0 if\u00a0 in the said former suit Pastor Alcazar was\u00a0 the defendant, he was such in the character of administrator of the intestate estate of the\u00a0 deceased Matea Alvarez, which is the defendant herein and represented by the same Alcazar as such administrator, for collection of the same interest at 10 per cent a year, a point already discussed and decided by this court in\u00a0 final form.<\/p><p>On this hypothesis it is improper to repeat herein the reasons and legal grounds assigned\u00a0 in the former decision of this court, rendered in said case No. 5045 of the General Docket and reported in 13 Phil. Rep., 282.<\/p><p>The question of payment of the\u00a0 sum of\u00a0 311.25\u00a0 pesos Mexican, or its equivalent\u00a0 in current money, for 252 demijohns for wine, which the\u00a0 plaintiffs\u00a0 sold to\u00a0 Pedro Arcenas, one of those who formerly acted as administrator of the property of the deceased Alvarez, lies especially within the jurisdiction\u00a0 of the court which\u00a0 heard the\u00a0 proceedings in said intestate succession and it may determine the nature and\u00a0 conditions of the said debt and\u00a0 the person or\u00a0 party liable for payment thereof.\u00a0 It was improper to add the action for collection thereof to that exercised\u00a0 for collection of the interest with which the value of said demijohns has no connection whatever, for if it constitutes a debt it would be for the administrator\u00a0 who\u00a0 contracted\u00a0 it; so no\u00a0 legal grounds exist whereby, in this suit, said claim may be duly decided with reference to the price of said demijohns against the intestate estate of the deceased Matea Alvarez.<\/p><p>For all the foregoing reasons, we hold that the judgment appealed from should be reversed and that we should absolve from the complaint, as we hereby do, the intestate succession of the deceased Matea Alvarez, represented by its administrator, Pastor\u00a0 Alcazar;\u00a0 without\u00a0 special finding as to costs in either instance.<\/p><p><em>Arellano, C.\u00a0 J.,\u00a0 Mapa<\/em> and <em>Johnson, JJ.<\/em>, concur.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 <\/p><hr align=\"center\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><p align=\"center\"><em><br\/>\u00a0 DISSENTING<\/em><br\/><\/p><p><em><br\/>TRENT, J.,<\/em> with whom concurs <em>Carson, J.<\/em>, <\/p><p>I dissent.\u00a0 This court says:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"So the question submitted to the court for decision\u00a0 is this:\u00a0 The contention between the plaintiff and counsel for the intestate succession of the deceased Matea Alvarez over interest\u00a0 to\u00a0 be\u00a0 paid on a certain sum\u00a0 which she owed at death having already been decided in its previous judgment, can the same question\u00a0 again arise in the present litigation?<\/p><p>\"There can\u00a0 be no doubt that there exists\u00a0 identity of persons, things, and\u00a0 rights of action between the present suit and the previous one which was finally decided by this court.<\/p><\/blockquote><p align=\"center\">*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<\/p><blockquote><p>\"It cannot be denied that the right of action exercised in the previous suit is reproduced\u00a0 in the present,\u00a0 for each is based on the same cause and reason.\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>I assert that this court did not decide in the former suit that the estate is\u00a0 not liable for the interest which the\u00a0 plain- tiff is seeking to recover.\u00a0\u00a0 In that case (13 Phil.

How and in what way? - A. That morning, while I was suckling my infant, my husband went toward the beach, and thereupon\u00a0 I heard the voice of my husband saying to them:\u00a0 'Why are you going to kill me?' and then I\u00a0 saw that my husband was covered with blood and Tomas Cueva was withdrawing a\u00a0 sharp piece of bamboo.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>She added immediately that he was withdrawing it from the left side of t deceased and\u00a0 that Platon Cueva was holding him by the right arm.<\/p><p align=\"center\">*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"Q.

Upon hearing\u00a0 my husband's voice I\u00a0 was at once seized with fear, f6r a day had not passed since the question before the <em>teniente<\/em>, and\u00a0 in fact when I\u00a0 looked out of window I saw Tomas pulling the piece of\u00a0 bamboo out of\u00a0 my\u00a0 husband's body and\u00a0 Platon\u00a0 Cueva\u00a0 just\u00a0 letting go\u00a0 of my husband's hand.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>From the foregoing it clearly appears that the witness did not see the commencement of\u00a0 the affair or the beginning of the assault that resulted the death of the victim, for when she looked out of the window of her house, alarmed by the words she had heard him utter, she saw him already covered with blood and at that instant one of the defendants was releasing his right arm and the other was withdrawing the weapon\u00a0 with which he ha just wounded him in the left side.\u00a0 The witness\u00a0 did\u00a0 not see the whole or the way in which\u00a0 it developed, but only\u00a0 one phase of it, or rather end or conclusion of it.\u00a0 What\u00a0 she saw and averred at the trial does no exclude the possibility that a quarrel or struggle between the deceased the defendants may have immediately preceded, or\u00a0 at least some dispute that would have\u00a0 put him on his guard as a timely precaution against the assault.\u00a0\u00a0 Not only does the\u00a0 contrary not appear positively, but it wou seem to be inferred from the phrase: <em>\"So\u00a0 you're going to, kill me?\"<\/em> heard by the deceased's wife,\u00a0 that some words of defiance or\u00a0 challenge passed between\u00a0 him and the\u00a0 defendants\u00a0 before he was\u00a0 assaulted. However that be,\u00a0 the\u00a0 fact\u00a0 is\u00a0 that\u00a0 the manner, form and circumstance in Which the assault began do not appear to be\u00a0 determined in the present case, and, this being so, ground is evidently lacking to establish with that the victim was\u00a0 wounded by one of the defendants while the other was holding him by the right arm, that\u00a0 it was not\u00a0 a mere accident of the possible struggle among the participants, and it is therefore\u00a0 impossible conclude legitimately, in view of this fact alone, accidental at times, completely destitute in the present case of circumstances and details that might determine its genuine juridical nature,\u00a0 that the defendants acted treachery or with impunity and without risk to their persons arising fro defense the already\u00a0 forewarned\u00a0 deceased might have offered, as he must have done, to judge from his own words quoted above, against their assault, which essentially constitutes\u00a0 and characterizes the circumstance <em>aleviosa<\/em>. It is not legally\u00a0 proper to qualify an\u00a0 act\u00a0 as\u00a0 treacherous the\u00a0 details\u00a0 that\u00a0 constitute\u00a0 it and the circumstances that preceded a concurred in its execution do not appear.<\/p><p>The principle laid down by this court\u00a0 in the case of U, S. <em> vs<\/em>. which\u00a0 is cited in the\u00a0 Attorney-General's brief, is not applicable here facts in that case and in this are not identical.\u00a0\u00a0 Therein it was prove certain and positive manner,\u00a0 and expressly so stated in the decision, t victim was caught and held by one of his assailants <em>unexpectedly and suddenly,<\/em> allowing him, therefore, neither time nor place to prepare defense, which does not happen in the case at\u00a0 bar, wherein the solitary only appears to be proved that one\u00a0 of the defendants was holding the victim by the right arm while he was wounded by the other, without any record, as stated above, either\u00a0 of the circumstances that immediately preceded the exact\u00a0 moment of the affray,\u00a0 or of the\u00a0 manner and conditions where under the affair developed and\u00a0 took place, knowledge whereof would be absolutely necessary and indispensable in order to be a to determine with exactness whether\u00a0 that act was\u00a0 or was not\u00a0 treacherous under the law.\u00a0 The suddenness and unexpectedness of the\u00a0 act of seizing and holding the\u00a0 victim, thereby depriving him of any offensive or defensive action from the first instant, are what characterize the treachery in the case\u00a0 against Feria, this being also what distinguishes that case\u00a0 from the pr wherein it does\u00a0 not appear to be definitely demonstrated that the victi was seized and held suddenly or unexpectedly.<\/p><p>The judgment appealed from is\u00a0 affirmed,\u00a0 with the costs of this instance against the appellant.<\/p><p><em>Arellano,\u00a0 C.

The petition sets out that among other concessions granted to the plaintiff company by Act No.  1510 of the Philippine Commission is the right to construct this branch line from  Calamba  to Santa Cruz.<\/p>\n<p>At the time of the institution of this action there were fifty-two parties defendant, but prior to the rendering  of the judgment herein the claims of many of the defendants were settled, and since the rendering of the judgment all other claims, with the exception of those of the defendant Mauro Prieto, have been satisfactorily adjusted, so that  of the original fifty-two  defendants Prieto is the only remaining party defendant to this  appeal.<\/p>\n<p>Both parties asked for the appointment of commissioners to value the land  and the improvements which  were the subject of the condemnation proceedings; and the trial court, in accordance with the provisions of section 243 of Act No. 190  of  the  Philippine Commission, appointed  as commissioners  W.  A. McVean,  Julian Pifion, and Hermenegildo Aquino.  These commissioners accepted their appointments as such and proceeded to the discharge of their duties. They held sessions in the village of Los Banos, made personal inspections of the lands which were the subject of the condemnation proceedings, heard both parties  as to their respective claims,  examined a large number of witnesses, and in due time rendered to the court a full and complete report of all their proceedings together with the conclusions at which they had arrived.   With some slight modifications the majority  report of the commissioners was  approved by the court and formed the basis of the judgment rendered herein.  Both parties are now before this court as appellants from that judgment.<\/p>\n<p>The valuations fixed for the land involved in this action form no part of the issues on this appeal.  The only question brought up  for consideration here is the value of  certain mejoras (improvements) which are alleged to have been either destroyed or used by the agents and employees of the plaintiff company.  The record shows, and it is not questioned,  that the defendant was a tenant of a large tract of land belonging to the Insular Government an4 known as the Hacienda de los Frailes, and that as such tenant  and by virtue of a waiver by the Government of its claim to compensation in his favor, he is entitled to compensation for the value of the mejoras (improvements) on the land held by him as tenant and condemned  in favor of the plaintiff company.<\/p>\n<p>The <em>mejoras<\/em>  (improvements)  on  the tract of land  in\nquestion consisted  largely  of plants and  trees, such as <em>naranjitos<\/em>, abacas, platanos, and trees of many other varieties.  The damages and injuries complained of were classified under four different heads, as  follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote><table border=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>1.  Damages done by the surveyors and engineers of the\n  plaintiff ..........................................................................<\/td>\n<td>P665.00<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2. Improvements destroyed in making the embankments and\n  fills  of the roadbed......................................................<\/td>\n<td>17,828.00<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3.  Improvements destroyed by Are alleged to have been\n  caused by agents and employees of plaintiff......................... <\/td>\n<td>1,950.00<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4.  Improvements destroyed  along the  side of the roadbed  ................................................................................... <\/td>\n<td>3,283.00<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody><\/table><\/blockquote>\n<p>In  addition to the above  items there was a claim for P400, for money which  defendant claimed he paid out in clearing and preparing for cultivation certain tracts of the land which were thereafter occupied and appropriated by the  plaintiff  company.  The  total   amount  of damages claimed by the defendant was P24,126.50.   The majority report of the commissioners fixed the value of the improvements,  and  awarded  the amount  of damages which the defendant should receive at P19,478.  This amount  was reduced by the lower court to P16,778.<\/p>\n<p>The plaintiff's contention is that the amount of damages awarded is grossly excessive and unjust and that the amount awarded in  the report  of the commissioners should  have been reduced  by at least P17,000.  The defendant urges that the proof showed the damages to have been crreater than those allowed by the commissioners and the court, and that the award of damage should conform to the proof.<\/p>\n<p>The only ground upon which the plaintiff company bases its contention  that the valuations are excessive is the minority report of one of the commissioners. The values assigned to some of the improvements may be  excessive but we are not prepared to say that such is the case.  Certainly there is no evidence  in the record which  would justify us in holding these values to be grossly excessive.  The commissioners in their report go into rather minute detail as to the reasons for the conclusions reached and the valuations fixed for the various items included therein.  There was sufficient evidence before the commissioners to support.the valuations fixed by them except only those later modified by the court below.  The trial court was of opinion that the price of P2 each  which was fixed for  the  orange trees (<em>naranjitos<\/em>) was excessive, and this was reduced to F1.50 for each tree; this on the ground that the evidence discloses that these, trees were comparatively young at the time of the expropriation,  and that the value fixed by  the majority report of  the  commissioners  was that  of full-grown  or nearly full-grown trees.  We are of opinion  that this reduction was just and reasonable.  Aside from the evidence taken into consideration by the trial judge we find no evidence in the record  in support of the contention  of  the railroad  plaintiff that the  valuations fixed in  the majority report of the  commissioners and  by the  trial  court  are .grossly  excessive,  and plaintiff company having  wholly failed to offer evidence in support of its allegations iii this regard when the opportunity so to do was provided in accordance with  law, it  has no  standing in this court  to demand a new  trial based on its unsupported allegations of grossly excessive valuation of the property by the commissioners and the court below.   (Philippine Railway Co. <em>vs.<\/em> Solon, 13 Phil.  Rep., 34.)<\/p>\n<p>The item of damages amounting to P1,950, which relates to the destruction of  improvements on lands adjoining the condemned lands and which is alleged to have been caused by fiire, was not, in our opinion, a proper item for the consideration of the commissioners.  Section  244 of Act No. 190,  which relates to the duties  of the commissioners  in condemnation proceedings, provides among other things  as follows: \"The commissioners shall assess the value of the property taken and used  *   *  *.\"  The  other provisions of this article relate to the question of consequential  damages  and benefits.  The land on  which the  mejoras   (improvements) alleged  to have been destroyed by fire  were located, was not property taken and used  by the plaintiff company for  the construction of  its railway line.  If the plaintiff is  liable for this item of damages  such liability cannot be enforced in these proceedings.  It  was error on the part of the trial court to take this item of damage into consideration in fixing its judgment.  The trial court,  however, reduced the amount of damage caused  by the fire  from P1,950 to P1,500  since  there was included  in this  item 900 orange  trees (<em>naranjitos<\/em>) and the price allowed for these trees was P1.50 for each tree instead of P2.<\/p>\n<p>For the reasons already stated we think  that no part of the damages which are alleged to have resulted from the negligent or willful acts  of the agents of the company in setting fire  to the mejoras (improvements)  on lands adjoining the lands actually condemned should have been considered or allowed in  these proceedings, and the judgment of the lower court awarding P16,778 as the amount of damages to be paid to the defendant should therefore be reduced by Pl,500, this latter  sum being the amount of these damages which  was included in the judgment.   Modified by substituting damages to the amount of P15,278 instead of P16,778, as  allowed by the court below, the judgment entered below is affirmed without costs to either party in this instance.<\/p>\n<p><em>Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Moreland,<\/em> and <em>Trent, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<br\/>\n<\/p>\n<\/div>",

Dionisia rode\u00a0 horseback and the rest\u00a0 followed\u00a0 on\u00a0 foot. During the trip between the two pueblos Dionisia dropped unawares some jewelry which she was carrying in a handkerchief, consisting of a clasp pin of tumbaga and three finger rings of the\u00a0 same metal, two of them set with three diamonds.\u00a0\u00a0 The third was set by means of clasps with four diamonds,\u00a0 all\u00a0 colored\u00a0 and\u00a0 of the size of\u00a0 a\u00a0 mongo\u00a0 seed, and\u00a0 one\u00a0 of the stones, at one end\u00a0 of the clasps, had a flaw easily perceptible, apparently, to the naked eye.\u00a0 With the exception of this last mentioned\u00a0 ring, all the said jewelry was found in the road and returned to its owner, the clasp pin\u00a0 and\u00a0 one of the rings set with three diamonds by the defendant, and the other ring of three stones also by a schoolboy of the barrio of Rizal,\u00a0 municipality of Nagcarlang.\u00a0 The defendant returned the clasp pin and the ring during the\u00a0 trip\u00a0 to San Pablo a few\u00a0 moments\u00a0 after\u00a0 he found them,\u00a0 though it is not clearly shown in the record whether he did so voluntarily or because some of his traveling\u00a0 companions had learned\u00a0 of his find and immediately told\u00a0 Dionisia\u00a0 Castillo.\u00a0\u00a0 Be\u00a0 this\u00a0 as\u00a0 it\u00a0 may,\u00a0 the abovedescribed ring\u00a0 with the four-stone\u00a0 setting was not recovered.<\/p><p> The defendant well knew, as shown by his own testimony, that Dionisia Castillo lost the said ring besides those which were returned to\u00a0 her,\u00a0 and if he really\u00a0 found\u00a0 and\u00a0 appropriated it to himself and\u00a0 did\u00a0 not return it to her, as the\u00a0 prosecution claims,\u00a0 it is evident that he committed the crime of theft described in paragraph\u00a0 2 of article 517 of the Penal Code,\u00a0 according to which \"those who finding something lost, and1 knowing who its owner is, appropriate it with the intent of profit,\"\u00a0 are guilty of theft.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 The defendant roundly denied the charge that he had found the ring in question.\u00a0\u00a0 He testified that he found only the clasp pin and the ring with the three diamonds, which he returned at\u00a0 once\u00a0 to Dionisia Castillo.\u00a0 There is indeed no direct evidence of that fact.\u00a0 The defendant's traveling companions saw him pick up\u00a0 something from the ground, whereupon he told them that he had found some diamonds, but none\u00a0 of them saw at\u00a0 the\u00a0 time\u00a0 how\u00a0 many\u00a0 or what kind of jewels\u00a0 were found\u00a0 by him.\u00a0 There are, however, two witnesses who saw the ring\u00a0 referred to in. the possession of the defendant two or three days after the date mentioned\u00a0 in the\u00a0 complaint.\u00a0 One of them\u00a0 testified that on the second day of the fiesta of San Pablo he and the defendant met\u00a0 in\u00a0 the cockpit\u00a0 of the said\u00a0 pueblo and that the latter offered to\u00a0 sell him,\u00a0 for the price of sixty pesos, a <em>tumbaga<\/em>\u00a0 ring with\u00a0 four colored diamonds of the size of a <em>mongo<\/em> seed,\u00a0 set therein\u00a0 by means of clasps,\u00a0 one of which stones, at one end of\u00a0 the\u00a0 clasps, had a flaw, for which reason and also because he had no money\u00a0 he did not wish to buy it.\u00a0 The other witness stated that on January\u00a0 16, 1911,\u00a0 in\u00a0 the pueblo of San Pablo, the defendant tried\u00a0 to pawn to him for P25 a <em>tumbaga<\/em> ring which had four colored diamonds of\u00a0 the\u00a0 size of\u00a0 a\u00a0 <em>mongo<\/em> seed set in it by\u00a0 means of clasps,\u00a0 and that he did not accept it as he did not then have any money.\u00a0 This witness\u00a0 also declared that one of the stones\u00a0 at one end of the clasps had a flaw in it.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 testimony of these two witnesses was not disproved nor\u00a0 contradicted in\u00a0 any manner by the defendant while on the stand, and we hold it to be true.<\/p><p> Now, the description which those witnesses give of the ring which\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant\u00a0 tried to sell or pawn to them coincides exactly in\u00a0 all its\u00a0 details with that of\u00a0 the\u00a0 ring lost by Dionisia Castillo the same kind of metal, the same number and size of diamonds, the same kind with respect to color, the same defect in one of the\u00a0 stones and,\u00a0 finally, the same form\u00a0 of\u00a0 setting as had the ring of\u00a0 the said Dionisia.\u00a0 It would be difficult to imagine more perfect and conclusive proof of the identity of these\u00a0 two rings.\u00a0 We are\u00a0 fully\u00a0 convinced\u00a0 that the\u00a0 ring seen\u00a0 by\u00a0 the witnesses mentioned in the possession of the defendant\u00a0 is the\u00a0 same one\u00a0 concerned in this\u00a0 case.\u00a0\u00a0 In view of\u00a0 the evidence\u00a0 it appears to us\u00a0 unquestionable that\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant\u00a0 found it together with the other jewelry which with good or bad grace he returned to Dionisia\u00a0 Castillo.\u00a0 As\u00a0 he appropriated it, knowing that it belonged to her, he is clearly guilty of the crime of theft with which he is charged in\u00a0 the complaint.<\/p><p> The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with the\u00a0 costs of this instance against the defendant.\u00a0\u00a0 So\u00a0 ordered.<\/p><p><em>Arellano, C.

U S. <em>vs<\/em>. Ortiz, 8 Phil. Rep., 752.)\u00a0 We think, therefore, that the connection of the defendants with the publication complained of is sufficiently charged.<\/p> <p> \"(2) It is also claimed\u00a0 that\u00a0 the facts alleged are\u00a0 not sufficient to state a cause of action and it is urged in support of\u00a0 this that\u00a0 the article\u00a0 complained of and which is copied in the. complaint, fails to mention the plaintiff or to show on its face that it refers to him.\u00a0 It is, however, specifically alleged in paragraph\u00a0 4 that the article was intended to refer to the plaintiff and was so understood by the public, and this allegation is admitted by the demurrer. Under the rule announced in Causin <em>vs<\/em>. Jakosalem (5 Phil. Rep., 155), where the words complained of do refer to\u00a0 the plaintiff 'an action for libel may be maintained even though the defamatory publication does not refer to the plaintiff by name.'<\/p> <p> \"(3) It is\u00a0 further\u00a0 urged that there is\u00a0 another\u00a0 action pending between the\u00a0 parties for the\u00a0 same cause.\u00a0\u00a0 This, it is true, is made a ground for\u00a0 demurrer by the Code of Civil Procedure, sec.\u00a0 91 (3),\u00a0 but like all grounds therein mentioned, it must 'appear upon the face' of the pleading objected to, and where it does not so appear 'the objection can only be\u00a0 taken by answer.\u00a0\u00a0 (Code C. P., sec. 92.) There\u00a0 is no averment in the complaint which indicates that there is another action pending.<\/p> <p> \"The fourth ground of the demurrer is\u00a0 not one\u00a0 recognised by law (Code C. P., sec. 91) nor do we find anything in Sanidad <em>vs<\/em>. Cabotaje (5 Phil. Rep., 204) Which\u00a0 would necessitate any change in the\u00a0 views already expressed.<\/p> <p> \"The demurrer is,\u00a0 therefore, overruled and defendants are given the usual five days to answer.\"<br\/> <br\/> On the 15th day of November,\u00a0 1909, the defendants presented their amended answer, which was as follows:<\/p> <p align=\"center\"> \"ANSWER;<\/p> <p> \"The defendants in\u00a0 the\u00a0 above-entitled cause, through their undersigned\u00a0 attorney, by their answer to the complaint,state:<\/p> <p> \"That the defendants deny generally the allegations of the complaint.<br\/> <br\/> \"As a special defense, the defendants allege:<br\/> <br\/> \"First.

Kalaw and Lope K. Santos were the editors in chief or directors of this paper on the 30th of October, 1908, and that said nine defendants named were the owners, editors, proprietors, managers,\u00a0 and publishers of said\u00a0 newspaper on\u00a0 said 30th of October,\u00a0 1908, for a long time prior thereto, and during all the time mentioned in the\u00a0 complaint.<\/p> <p> \"As to the\u00a0 defendants, Reyes, Aguilar, and Liquete, they appear from the evidence to have been editors of said paper, but in a subordinate position to the chief editors or directors, Kalaw and Santos,\u00a0 and to have acted\u00a0 under the direction\u00a0 of the latter two defendants.<\/p> <p> \"The\u00a0 court further finds that every essential or material allegation of\u00a0 the complaint is true substantially as therein stated, with the exception noted as to Fidel A.

It is as clear to the court from\u00a0 the evidence adduced as the noonday\u00a0 sun, that the plaintiff\u00a0 is the identical and only person meant and referred to in said article 'Birds of Prey;'\u00a0 and it requires\u00a0 no argument to prove that it does\u00a0 mean\u00a0 and refer to him and was so intended by\u00a0 the writer, and therefore by said\u00a0 nine defendants,\u00a0 and could not have been otherwise understood\u00a0 by any intelligent\u00a0 reader or subscriber of said paper, in view of the reasons assigned in the complaint, which reasons are clearly disclosed and fully established by the evidence.\u00a0 And it may be added that\u00a0 much\u00a0 valuable time was needlessly consumed by the defense at\u00a0 the trial in an effort to establish the contrary.<\/p> <p> \"It seems to the court\u00a0 a reflection\u00a0 upon the intelligence of the subscribers and readers of\u00a0 'El Renacimiento' to contend that this editorial was not well understood by them as referring to\u00a0 the plaintiff,\u00a0 and as fully as\u00a0 if his name had been mentioned in every paragraph thereof.\u00a0 And assuredly the omission of his name from the editorial has made the libel none the less hurtful and disastrous in its results to the reputation and feelings of the plaintiff.<\/p> <p> \"Much time was consumed also in adducing evidence to show\u00a0 that\u00a0 none\u00a0 of the twelve defendants were the owners of 'El Renacimiento' and\u00a0 'Muling Pagsilang' but that six of them had originally contributed their money as a patriotic donation to the\u00a0 Filipino people, and that Martin Ocampo simply held the money and property of the paper as trustees for this people, and that the paper was being devoted exclusively to philanthropic and patriotic ends, and that Galo Lichauco had agreed to contribute to the same ends, but had not done so.<\/p> <p> \"This proposition in the light of the evidence is so preposterous as to entitle it to little, if any, serious consideration.\u00a0 To ask the court to believe it is tantamount to asking the court to stultify reason and common sense.\u00a0 That those seyen defendants named contributed their respective sums of money, as shown by the evidence, to the foundation of said newspaper\u00a0 in 1901 for their own personal benefit and profit, is fully and unmistakably established.\u00a0\u00a0 It is equally well established that Martin Oeampo is and was, not only a part owner, but that he has been and is still the administrator or business manager of said newspaper, and that the other six persons named are shareholders, part owners and proprietors thereof,\u00a0 and\u00a0 were such on\u00a0 said\u00a0 30th\u00a0 of October, 1908.<br\/> <br\/> \"Arcadio Arellano testified positively that Galo Lichauco was one of the seven founders, and that Lichauco\u00a0 contributed P1,000. Martin Ocampo testified that Galo Lichauco promised to contribute an amount which he (the witness) did not\u00a0 remember but that Lichauco did not keep his promise.\u00a0 (See pp. 107, 108, and 231 of the evidence.)<br\/> <br\/> \"The\u00a0 other evidence and circumstances strongly\u00a0 corroborate\u00a0 Arcadio Arellano, and the\u00a0 court\u00a0 is constrained\u00a0 to believe that Arellano told the truth and Oeampo did not. See Exhibit B-J, a copy of 'El Renacimiento' containing the article 'Infamy Among Comrades' page 87 of\u00a0 the evidence, in which there was published that these seven persons named are the shareholders\u00a0 of the paper.<\/p> <p> \"Furthermore, Galo Lichauco failed to appear and testify, so as\u00a0 to enlighten the court as\u00a0 to\u00a0 which witness, Arellano or Oeampo, told the truth, or whether chief editor Kalaw had his authority to publish in said\u00a0 paper, as he\u00a0 did on November 22, 1907, that he, Galo Lichauco,\u00a0 was\u00a0 one\u00a0 of\u00a0 the shareholders.\u00a0 The presumptions are therefore against Galo\u00a0 Lichauco.\u00a0\u00a0 See S.

Worcester, was born on the surface of the\u00a0 globe to\u00a0 eat and devour, like a bird of prey, and that others, born\u00a0 to be\u00a0 eaten\u00a0 and devoured, are the prey and food of the insatiable voracity of the\u00a0 plaintiff; that the plaintiff has a\u00a0 desire to copy and imitate the most rapacious bird, the eagle, in order to triumph in plundering his fellowman; that the plaintiff besides being an eagle, has the characteristics of the vulture, the owl, and the vampire.<\/p> <p> \"That the\u00a0 plaintiff ascended the\u00a0 mountains of Benguet to classify and measure the skulls of the Igorots, and study and civilize them and to espy in his flight with the eye of the bird of prey the large deposits\u00a0 of gold - the prey concealed amidst\u00a0 the\u00a0 lonely mountains - and to\u00a0 appropriate them to himself afterwards, and that to this end the plaintiff had\u00a0 the legal facilities, <em>made and unmade at his own will, and that this is always done\u00a0 for his own benefit.<\/em><\/p> <p> \"That the plaintiff authorized, in\u00a0 spite of laws and ordinances, the illegal slaughtering of diseased cattle in order to derive benefit from the infected and putrid meat which he himself was obliged\u00a0 to condemn <em>by virtue of his official position<\/em>; that\u00a0 while the plaintiff presents himself on all occasions with\u00a0 the wrinkled brow of the scientist who consumes his life in the mysteries of the laboratory of science, his whole\u00a0 scientific labor is confined to\u00a0 dissecting insects and importing fish eggs.<\/p> <p> \"That although the plaintiff gave an\u00a0 admirable impulse to the discovery of wealthy lodes in Mindanao and Mindoro, and in other virgin regions of the\u00a0 Archipelago, with\u00a0 the money of the people, under the pretext of the public good, as a\u00a0 strict matter\u00a0 of truth his object was to possess all the data and the key to the national wealth <em>for\u00a0 his essentially personal benefit,<\/em> and that this\u00a0 is shown by his acquisition of immense properties registered\u00a0 under\u00a0 the names , of others.<\/p> <p> \"That the plaintiff promoted, through secret agents and partners, the sale to the city of Manila of worthless land at fabulous prices, which the city fathers dared not refuse from fear of displeasing the plaintiff, who was behind the project, and which they did\u00a0 not refuse for their own good; that the plaintiff favored concessions for hotels in Manila on filled-in land; with the prospect of enormous profits, at the expense of the blood of\u00a0 the people.<\/p> <p> \"That such are the characteristics of the plaintiff, who is at the same time an eagle that surprises and\u00a0 devours, a vulture\u00a0 that gorges himself on\u00a0 dead and rotten meats, an owl that aifects a petulant omniscience, and a\u00a0 vampire that sucks the blood of the victim until he leaves it bloodless. And this libelous article concludes with the asseveration in substance that the plaintiff has been 'weighed in the balance and found wanting' - 'Mane, Tecel, Phares.'<\/p> <p> \"That this editorial is malicious and injurious goes without saying.\u00a0 Almost every line thereof teems with malevolence, ill\u00a0 will, and\u00a0 wanton\u00a0 and reckless\u00a0 disregard of the rights and feelings of\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiff; and from the very nature and number of the\u00a0 charges therein contained the editorial is necessarily very damaging to the plaintiff.<\/p> <p> \"That this editorial,\u00a0 published\u00a0 as it was by the nine defendants, tends to impeach\u00a0 the\u00a0 honesty and reputation of the plaintiff and publishes his alleged defects, and thereby exposes him to public hatred,\u00a0 contempt, and!\u00a0 ridicule, is clearly seen by a bare reading of the editorial.<\/p> <p> \"It suffices to say that not a line is to be found in all the evidence in support\u00a0 of these\u00a0 malicious,\u00a0\u00a0 defamatory, and injurious\u00a0 charges against the plaintiff; and there was at the trial no pretense whatever by the defendants that any of them are true, nor the slightest evidence introduced to show the truth of a solitary charge; nor is there any plea of justification or\u00a0 that t{ie charges are\u00a0 true, much less evidence to sustain such a plea.<\/p> <p> \"In the\u00a0 opinion of the court 'Birds of\u00a0 Prey,' when read and\u00a0 considered in its relation to\u00a0 and connection with the other articles libelous and defamatory in nature, published of and concerning the plaintiff by these nine defendants anterior\u00a0 and subsequent to the publication of this article, and having reference to the same subject matter as shown by the evidence, is one of the worst libels of record.\u00a0\u00a0 It is safe to say that in all the\u00a0 court reports of the Philippine Islands,\u00a0 or of Spain, of England,\u00a0 or the\u00a0 United States, there is not to be found a libel case in which there is a more striking\u00a0 exemplification of the spirit of hatred, bad faith, evil motive,\u00a0 mischievous intent, actual malice, nefarious purpose,\u00a0 base malignity, or gross malevolence.<\/p> <p> \"It is proper to observe' also that since the beginning of this attack on\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiff in the year\u00a0 1906 down almost to the present\u00a0 time, so far from there being any apology, retraction, or effort to repair the injury already done\u00a0 as far as lay in the power of the defendants, the persecution, wrong, and tortious injury to the plaintiff have been steadily kept up and persisted in, without the slightest abatement of the malevolent spirit.<br\/> <br\/> \"There has been neither retraction, apology, nor reparation ; per contra, the libel has been repeated, reiterated, and accentuated, and\u00a0 widely and extensively\u00a0 propagated by these nine defendants through\u00a0 the\u00a0 columns of\u00a0 their said paper and otherwise; and it appears\u00a0 from the evidence that especial effort has been made by these same defendants to give as much publicity as possible to the libeloiis and defamatory words used of and concerning the plaintiff in said editorial.<\/p> <p> \"Through their instrumentality and persistency in asserting and reasserting its\u00a0 truth, this diabolical libel has been spread broadcast over the Philippine Islands and to\u00a0 other parts of the world.\u00a0 In said criminal case No. 4295 some of these nine defendants pleaded the truth of the charges; and in Exhibit A-Q is to\u00a0 be found this language: 'The defense\u00a0 will\u00a0 adduce its evidence demonstrating the\u00a0 truth of every one of the facts published.<\/p> <p> \"In their said paper of the 11th of January, 1909,\u00a0 there is published this statement:<\/p> <p> \" 'The\u00a0 brief period of time allowed us by the court, at the request of\u00a0 pur counsel, to gather evidence which we are to adduce\u00a0 in our\u00a0 effort to\u00a0 demonstrate the truth of\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the accusations that we have formulated in the article which is the subject\u00a0 of the agitation against us, having expired, the trial of the case against our director has been resumed.' (See pp. 63\u00a0 and 67 of the evidence.)<br\/> <br\/> \"And about the same time they also declared ia their said paper thai 'there is more graft than fish in the rivers of Benguet'\u00a0 And this\u00a0 in the year of our Lord 1909! the persecution\u00a0 having begun\u00a0 in 1905;\u00a0 thus indicating that there is to be no 'let-up' or cessation of the hostile attitude toward the\u00a0 plaintiff or the\u00a0 vilification of\u00a0 his\u00a0 name and assaults upon his character, much less a\u00a0 retraction or an apology, unless drastic means and measures are made use of to the end\u00a0 that there may be\u00a0 no further propagation of the libel, or asseveration,\u00a0 or reiteration of its truth.<\/p> <p> \"This article 'Birds of Prey' charges the plaintiff with malfeasance\u00a0 in office and criminal acts, and is\u00a0 therefore lifoelous per se.\u00a0 It in substance charges the plaintiff with the prostitution of his office as a member of\u00a0 the Civil Commission of\u00a0 the Philippine\u00a0 Islands and Secretary of the Interior of said Islands for personal ends.\u00a0\u00a0 It'is charged also substantially that plaintiff in his official capacity wasted the public funds for the purpose of promoting his own personal welfare, and that he violated the laws of the Philippine Islands and the ordinances of the city of Manila.<\/p> <p> \"In its essence he is charged with taking part in illegal combinations for the purpose of robbing\u00a0 the people with the object of gain\u00a0 for himself and for others; with being a bird of prey, a vulture (buzzard), an owl,\u00a0 and a vampire that sucks the blood of the victim (meaning the people) until he leaves it bloodless; that is to say, robs the people, until he leaves them wretched and poverty-stricken, deprived of all worldly possessions; and lastly, that he, the plaintiff, like Belshazzar, has been weighed in the balance and found wanting as a high Government functionary; all of which charges are false and malicious and without any foundation whatever in fact, as the evidence fully demonstrates.<\/p> <p> \"It is alsa a matter of fact, and the court so finds, that said defamation was written and published that it might be understood, and it was understood, by the public officials of the Government and the people of the Philippine Islands in general, and\u00a0 wherever\u00a0 else said newspaper may have circulated and been read, as charging the plaintiff with the tortious and\u00a0 criminal\u00a0 acts and conduct charged\u00a0 in\u00a0 said editorial as hereinbefore specified and interpreted.<\/p> <p> \"The court finds it also\u00a0 true that, besides assailing the integrity and reviling the reputation of the\u00a0 plaintiff,\u00a0 said nine defendants, in publishing said libel, did so with the malicious intention of inciting the Filipino people to believe that the plaintiff was despotic and corrupt and\u00a0 unworthy of the position which he held, and for this reason to oppose his\u00a0 administration of the office in\u00a0 his charge as\u00a0 Secretary of the Interior, and in this way they endeavored to create enormous\u00a0 difficulties for him in the performance of his official duties, and to make him so unpopular that he would have to resign his office as\u00a0 a member of the Civil Commission of the Philippines and\u00a0 Secretary of the Interior.<br\/> <br\/> \"It is also true that the said nine defendants, by means of said libel, and other\u00a0 like false statements in their\u00a0 said newspaper, have been\u00a0 deliberately trying to destroy the confidence of\u00a0 the public in the plaintiff\u00a0 and to incite the people to\u00a0 place obstacles in his way in the performance of his official duties, in consequence of which the plaintiff has met with many\u00a0 difficulties which\u00a0 have\u00a0 greatly\u00a0 increased his labors as a public official.<br\/> <br\/> \"It further\u00a0 appears from the evidence\u00a0 that not only has. an effort been made by these nine defendants to give as much publicity as possible to the charges, but in order that said defamation should attract the attention of the public, they published the\u00a0 same under\u00a0 a\u00a0 heading in\u00a0 large, bold and\u00a0 showy type,\u00a0 so that it might be easily seen\u00a0 and read by all the subscribers and readers of said paper.<\/p> <p> \"In full view of all the evidence, therefore, it is clearly seen that every essential allegation\u00a0 of the complaint is true substantially as therein claimed, and that the whole of the said editorial relating to the misconduct and bad character\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 of the plaintiff is false and without the slightest foundation in fact.\u00a0\u00a0 Not a scintilla of evidence was introduced in support\u00a0 of any\u00a0 injurious\u00a0 charge made therein\u00a0 against the plaintiff, to. say nothing, of the plaintiff's evidence that each and every charge of malfeasance therein contained is false, and without reference to whether\u00a0 a failure to plead the truth admits the falsity of the charge.<br\/> <br\/> \"The\u00a0 evidence shows no\u00a0 'special' or 'actual\u00a0 pecuniary damage and none is alleged in the complaint.\u00a0 Two other kinds\u00a0 of damages, however,\u00a0 are claimed, to wit, general damages for injuries to the feelings and reputation of the plaintiff and additional work to which he\u00a0 has\u00a0 been put by the conduct of the defendants,\u00a0 which are laid in the sum of P50,000, and\u00a0 'punitive,' exemplary,\u00a0 or vindictive damages, 'as a warning to the defendants,' or as expressed in Act 277\u00a0 of the\u00a0 Philippine Commission,\u00a0 'as a just punishment to the libelers and an example to others,' which are laid in the same sum of P50,000.<br\/> <br\/> \"The\u00a0 nine\u00a0 defendants being liable to the plaintiff for damages, the\u00a0 next\u00a0 question to be decided\u00a0 is what amount of damages should\u00a0 be awarded the plaintiff\u00a0 for the injury to his\u00a0 reputation and feelings and this being a proper ease for punitive damages, the further\u00a0 question is, what\u00a0 sum shall be awarded as a just punishment to these nine libelers and as an example to others.\u00a0\u00a0 In neither of these cases is there any precise measure of damages.<\/p> <p> \"In\u00a0 determining\u00a0 the\u00a0 amount to be awarded in the\u00a0 first instance it\u00a0 is proper to consider the previous character, influence, reputation, standing, official position,\u00a0 hope of advancement,\u00a0 prospect of promotion, and\u00a0 social status of the plaintiff and his family, and all\u00a0 the circumstances\u00a0 connected with the\u00a0 case.<\/p> <p> \"The plaintiff is a man in the\u00a0 prime of\u00a0 life, holding, as he has held for the last ten years\u00a0 an important, responsible, lucrative, high and exalted position of trust and honor in the service\u00a0 of the\u00a0 Government\u00a0 of the United States, in the Philippine Islands, without a blotch\u00a0 on his family escutcheon, so far as the evidence shows, and with an untarnished reputation as a man, as a citizen, and as a Government official.<\/p> <p> \"He is a man of honesty, integrity, and high social position ; a man of learning, famous as a scientist, and scientific achievements\u00a0 and scholarly attainments, a man of industrious habits, genuine\u00a0 worth,\u00a0 and intellectual force.\u00a0\u00a0 He has\u00a0 read, studied, traveled, and\u00a0 learned much, and is an author of merit and distinction.\u00a0 He was for a long while a\u00a0 professor in one of the largest and\u00a0 most renowned institutions of learning in\u00a0 the world; he is\u00a0 a man\u00a0 of\u00a0 vast experience, broad\u00a0 and liberal views,\u00a0 and an\u00a0 extensive acquaintanceship, not only in the Philippine Islands, but in the United States and other countries of the world.\u00a0\u00a0 He was well\u00a0 and\u00a0 favorably received by the people\u00a0 wherever he journeyed previous to this atrocious libel upon his integrity and reputation.<\/p> <p> \"He has discharged the\u00a0 duties of his lofty official position in a manner that reflects credit upon himself as well as the Government which he represents, and apparently with entire satisfaction to all of\u00a0 his superiors in office and the people generally;\u00a0 and\u00a0 but for this\u00a0 pernicious, outrageous,\u00a0 and highly reprehensible assault upon his good name, fame and reputation, there were prospects of promotion to higher honors.\u00a0\u00a0 And so far as his personal and private record is concerned\u00a0 it was without a blemish anterior to the time when these unfounded and dastardly aspersions were\u00a0 cast upon it\u00a0 by these nine defendants.<\/p> <p> \"Indeed, it is\u00a0 only necessary to advert to the testimony of the defense itself to ascertain that the plaintiff is an honorable man,\u00a0 and without a stain upon his character, officially or otherwise.\u00a0 It\u00a0 would be interesting to note here in parallel columns and compare the charges made in 'Birds of Prey' and the testimony of one of the witnesses\u00a0 for the defendants.<\/p> <p> \"Felipe Buencamino,\u00a0 an intelligent witness for the de- feftse, in his\u00a0 testimony\u00a0 (p. 240) when asked the question, Do you know Mr. Worcester?'\u00a0 he\u00a0 answers, 'Yes,\u00a0 sir; I know him as an honorable man.\u00a0 I also know him as an honest,\u00a0 honorable public\u00a0 official.'\u00a0 In answer to another question he says, 'As I have said,\u00a0 I\u00a0 know Mr. Worcester as a private citizen and as a public\u00a0 official, and my opinion of him is that of an honorable man\u00a0 and an upright official.' And no other witness testified anything to the contrary. \".

They seemed to be proud of the fact that\u00a0 they were, the owners.\u00a0 The editors, publishers, and managers of \"El Renacimiento,\" at the time the reply to \"El\u00a0 Comercio\" was published, seemed to be anxious to\u00a0 announce to the public who its\u00a0 owners were.\u00a0 It (\"El\u00a0 Renacimiento\") had not then realized that it belonged\u00a0 to no one; that it had\u00a0 been born into the community without parentage ;.that it had been created a terrible machine for the purpose of destroying the good character and reputation of men\u00a0 without\u00a0 having any one to respond for its malicious damage occasioned to honorable men; that it was a castsoff, without a past or the hope of a future; that it was liable to be kicked and buffetted about and persecuted and destroyed without any one to protect it; that its former friends\u00a0 and creators had scattered hither and thither and had disappeared like feathers before\u00a0 a cyclone, declaring,\u00a0 under oath, that they\u00a0 did not know their offspring and were not willing to recognize it in public.\u00a0 It seems to have been a Moses found in\u00a0 the bulrushes, destined by its creators to be a great good among the Filipino people, in teaching them to respect the rights of persons\u00a0 and property; but, unlike its Biblical prototype, it became, by reason of its lack of parentage, an engine of destruction let loose in the State, to enter the private abode of lawabiding citizens and to take from them their honor and reputation, which neither it nor the State could restore. To rob a man of his wealth is to rob him of trash, but to take from him his good name and reputation is to rob him of that which does not make the robber richer and leaves the person\u00a0 robbed poor indeed.<\/p> <p> The appellants tried to make\u00a0 it appear that the money which the gave for the establishment of \"El Renacimiento\" was a pure donation.\u00a0 They claim that it was a donation to the Filipino\u00a0 people.\u00a0 They do not\u00a0 state, however,\u00a0 or attempt to\u00a0 show what particular persons\u00a0 were to manage, control, and direct the enterprise for which the donation was made.\u00a0\u00a0 A donation must be made to definite persons or associations.\u00a0 A donation to an indefinite person or association is an anomaly in law, and we do not believe, in view of all\u00a0 of the facts, that it was in fact made.\u00a0 A donation must be made to some definite person or association and the donee must be some\u00a0 ascertained or ascertainable person or association.<br\/> <br\/> A donation may be made for the benefit of the public, but it must be made, in\u00a0 the\u00a0 very nature of things, to\u00a0 some definite person or association.\u00a0 A donation made to\u00a0 no person or association could not be regarded as a donation in law.\u00a0 <em>It could not be more\u00a0 than an\u00a0 abandonment\u00a0 of\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 property.<\/em>\u00a0 Of course where a donation is in fact\u00a0 made, without reservation\u00a0 to a particular person or association, the donor is no longer the owner of the thing donated nor responsible, in any way, for its use, provided that the object, for which the donation was made, was legal.\u00a0 A person does not become an\u00a0 owner or part owner of a church, for example, to the construction of which he has made a donation; neither is\u00a0 he responsible for the use to which said edifice may be applied.\u00a0\u00a0 No one disputes the fact that donations may be made for the public use, but they must be made to definite persons or associations,\u00a0 to be\u00a0 administered in accordance with\u00a0 the purpose of the gift.<\/p> <p> <em>We can not believe<\/em>, in the light of the whole record, <em>that the defendants and appellants, at the time they presented the defense that they were donors simply and not owners, had a reasonable\u00a0 hope that their declarations as to said donation, given in the manner alleged, would be believed by the court<\/em>.<\/p> <p> After a careful examination of the evidence brought to this court and taking into consideration the failure of the other defendants to testify, we are of the opinion that a preponderance of such evidence shows that the defendants, Martin\u00a0 Ocampo,\u00a0 Manuel Palma,\u00a0 Arcadio Arellano,\u00a0 Angel Jose, Galo Lichauco, Felipe Barretto, and Gregorio M.

Derby, 3 Ill., 126.)<\/p> <p> This same principle is recognized\u00a0 by Act\u00a0 277 of the Philippine Commission.\u00a0 Section 6 provides that:<\/p> <blockquote> <p> \"Every author, editor or proprietor\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 is chargeable with the publication of any words in any part\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 * or number of each newspaper,\u00a0 as fully as\u00a0 if he were the author of the same.\"<\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>\u00a0 In our opinion the lower court committed no error in rendering a joint and several judgment against the defendants and allowing an\u00a0 execution\u00a0 against their individual property.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 provisions\u00a0 of\u00a0 the Civil\u00a0 and Commercial Codes cited by the defendants and\u00a0 appellants have no application\u00a0 whatever to the question presented\u00a0 in the present case.<\/p> <p>The tenth assignment of error above noted relates solely to the amount of damages suffered on account of wounded feelings, mental suffering and injury to the good name and reputation of Mr. Worcester, by reason of the alleged libelous publication.\u00a0 The lower court found that the damages thus suffered by Mr. Worcester amounted to P35,000.\u00a0 This assignment of error presents a most difficult\u00a0 question.\u00a0 The amount of\u00a0 damages resulting from a libelous publication to a man's good name and reputation is difficult of ascertainment.\u00a0 It is not difficult to\u00a0 realize that the damage thus done is great\u00a0 and\u00a0 almost immeasurable.\u00a0 The\u00a0 specific amount of damages to be\u00a0 awarded must depend upon\u00a0 the facts in each case\u00a0 and the sound discretion of\u00a0 the\u00a0 court. No fixed or precise rules can be laid down governing the amount of damages in cases of libel. It is difficult to include all of the facts and\u00a0 conditions which enter into the measure of such damages.\u00a0 <em>A\u00a0 man's good name and reputation\u00a0 are\u00a0 worth more to him than all the wealth which he can accumulate during a lifetime of industrious labor.\u00a0 To have them destroyed may be eminently of more damage to him personally than the destruction of\u00a0 his physical wealth.<\/em>\u00a0 The loss is immeasurable.\u00a0 No amount of money can compensate him for his loss.\u00a0 Notwithstanding the great loss which he, from his standpoint, sustains, the courts must have some tangible\u00a0 basis upon which to estimate such damages.<\/p> <p> In discussing the element of damages in a case of libel, the Honorable James C. Jenkins, who tried the present case in the court below, correctly said that, <em>\"The enjoyment of a private reputation is as much a constitutional right as the possession of life, liberty or property.<\/em> It is one of\u00a0 those rights\u00a0 necessary to human society, that underlie the whole scheme of human civilization.\u00a0 The\u00a0 respect and esteem of his fellows are among the highest rewards of a\u00a0 wellspent life vouchsafed to man in this existence.\u00a0\u00a0 The hope of it is the inspiration of youth and its possession\u00a0 is a solace in later years. A man of affairs, a business man, who has been seen and known by his f ellowmen in the active pursuits of life for many years, and who has developed a great\u00a0 character and an unblemished reputation, has\u00a0 secured a possession more useful and more valuable than lands or houses or silver or gold.\u00a0 The law recognizes the value of such a reputation and constantly\u00a0 strives to give redress for\u00a0 its injury.\u00a0\u00a0 It imposes upon him who attacks it by slanderous words\u00a0 or libelous publications,\u00a0 the\u00a0 liability to make full compensation\u00a0 for the damage to\u00a0 the reputation, for the shame, obloquy and for\u00a0 the injury\u00a0 to the feelings\u00a0 of\u00a0 its owner, which are caused by the publication of the slander or libel.\u00a0\u00a0 The law goes further.\u00a0 If the words are spoken or the publication is made with the intent\u00a0 to injure the victim\u00a0 or with criminal\u00a0 indifference to civil obligation, it imposes such damages as the jury, in view\u00a0 of all the circumstances of the particular case, adjudge that the wrongdoer ought to pay as an example to the public and to deter others from doing likewise, and for punishment\u00a0 for the infliction of the injury.\"<\/p> <p> As was said above, the\u00a0 damages suffered\u00a0 by Mr.\u00a0 Worcester to\u00a0 his good name\u00a0 and\u00a0 reputation\u00a0 are most difficult of ascertainment.\u00a0 The attorney for the appellants, in his brief, lends the court\u00a0 but little assistance in reaching a\u00a0\u00a0 conclusion upon\u00a0 this question.\u00a0\u00a0 The appellants\u00a0 leave\u00a0 the whole question to the discretion\u00a0 of the court, without any argument whatever.<\/p> <p> After a careful examination, we are of the opinion that that part\u00a0 of the judgment of the lower court relating to the damages\u00a0 suffered by the\u00a0 Honorable Dean C. Worcester, should be\u00a0 modified, and that a judgment should be rendered in favor of Mr, Dean C, Worcester and against the defendants, jointly and severally, for the\u00a0 sum of P15,000, with interest at 6 per cent from the 23d of January, 1909.<\/p> <p> With reference to the eleventh assignment of error above noted, to\u00a0 wit:\u00a0 That the court erred in imposing punitive damages upon the defendants, we are of the opinion, after a careful examination of the evidence, and in view of all of the facts and circumstances and the malice connected with the publication of said editorial and the subsequent publications with relation to said editorial, that the lower court, by virtue of the provisions of Act No. 277 of the Philippine Commission,\u00a0 was justified in imposing punitive damages upon the defendants. <\/p> <p> Section\u00a0 11 of Act No. 277 allows the court, in\u00a0 an action for libel,\u00a0 to render a judgment for\u00a0 punitive\u00a0 damages, in an amount which the court may think will be a just punishment to the libeler and an example to others.<\/p> <p> Exemplary damages in civil actions for libel may always be recovered if the defendant or defendants are actuated by malice.\u00a0 In the present case there was not the slightest effort on the part of\u00a0 the defendants to show the existence of probable cause or foundation whatever for the facts contained in said editorial.\u00a0 Malice, hatred, and ill will against the\u00a0 plaintiff are seen throughout the\u00a0 record. The said editorial not only attempted to paint the plaintiff as a villain, but upon\u00a0 every occasion, the defendants resorted to ridicule of the severest kind.<\/p> <p> Here again we find difficulty in arriving at a conclusion relating to the damages which should be imposed upon the defendants for the purpose of punishment.\u00a0 Upon this question the courts must be governed in each case by the evidence, the circumstances and their sound discretion.\u00a0 Taking into consideration the fact that some of the defendants have been prosecuted criminally and have\u00a0 been sentenced, and considering that fact as a part of the punitive damages, we have arrived at the conclusion that the judgment\u00a0 of the lower court should be Modified, and that a judgment should be rendered against the defendants, jointly and severally, and in favor of the plaintiff, the Honorable Dean C. Worcester, in the sum of P10,000, as punitive damages, with interest at 6 per cent from the 23d day of January, 1909.<br\/> <br\/> Therefore, after a full consideration of all of the facts contained\u00a0 in the\u00a0 record\u00a0 and the errors assigned by the appellants in this court, we are of the opinion\u00a0 that the judgment of the lower court should\u00a0 be modified and that a judgment should be rendered in favor of Dean C. Worcester and against the defendants\u00a0 Martin Ocampo, Teodoro\u00a0 M. Kalaw, Manuel Palma,\u00a0 Arcadio Arellano, Angel Jose, Galo Lichauco, Felipe Barretto, and Gregorio M. Cansipit, jointly and severally, for the sum of P25,000 with interest at 6 per cent from the 23d day of January, 1909, with costs, and that a judgment should be entered absolving Lope K. Santos from any liability under said complaint.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<\/p> <em>Carson, Moreland,<\/em> and <em>Trent, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<br\/> <br\/> <br\/> <hr align=\"center\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/> <div align=\"center\"><br\/> <em>CONCURRING<\/em><\/div> <p> <strong>ARELLANO, C.

He could not be held to be\u00a0 in the situation of the other so-called founders of \"El Renacimiento,\" under article 117 of the Code of Commerce, according to which:<\/p> <blockquote> <p>\"Articles of association, executed with the essential requisites\u00a0 of law, shall be valid and binding between the parties thereto, no matter what form,\u00a0 conditions, and combinations, legal and honest, are embraced therein, provided they are not expressly prohibited by this code.\"<\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>There operates in favor of these other so-called founders of \"El Renacimiento\" the testimony of the real founder and manager thereof, Martin Ocampo, who at the trial admitted that they had\u00a0 subscribed and\u00a0 paid sums of money to aid him in the business he had projected.<\/p> <p> But with\u00a0 reference to Galo Uchauco,\u00a0 Martin Ocampo explicitly stated that he offered to contribute, but did not carry out his offer and in fact paid nothing. It is\u00a0 incomprehensible\u00a0 how one could claim the right or title to share the earnings or profits of a company\u00a0 when\u00a0 he had\u00a0 put no capital into it, neither is it comprehensible how one could share\u00a0 in\u00a0 the losses\u00a0 thereof, and still less\u00a0 incur liability for damages on account of some act of the said\u00a0 company - an unrestricted liability to\u00a0 the extent of all his property, as though he were a\u00a0 regular general partner when he was not such.<\/p> <p> If there could\u00a0 be\u00a0 one law for and\u00a0 another against, or, in other words, one for rights and another for obligations, emanating from the same source, as in a contract of partnership, then it\u00a0 might well happen\u00a0 that\u00a0 one could be a partner for assuming obligations, losses and liabilities, and not a partner in the sense of exercising rights and of participation in the earnings and profits of partnership.\u00a0 But the contrary is a legal axiom, and it is impossible to\u00a0 set aside the principle of reciprocity that pervades and regulates in equal manner rights and obligations.\u00a0 Hence it is impossible to reach\u00a0 as a conclusion derived from the evidence set. forth that Galo\u00a0 Lichauco is a partner in the Renacimiento\u00a0 company\u00a0 and coowner of the newspaper of that name.<\/p> <p> Judgment so rendered\u00a0 would not clothe Galo Lichauco, after he had been sentenced to pay\u00a0 damages for acts of \"El\u00a0 Renacimiento,\"\u00a0 with any\u00a0 title,\u00a0 right,\u00a0 or reason for calling himself a\u00a0 coowner of said business\u00a0 and entitle him to claim a share of any earnings and profits which might be realized in the meantime or in\u00a0 the future.\u00a0 He would not be entitled to register\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 mercantile registry\u00a0 on such ground, nor would or could any court oblige the Renacimiento company or Martin Ocampo to\u00a0 regard Galo Lichauco as a partner or coowner.<\/p> <p> From the testimony of a single witness, corroborated by a newspaper article, wherein it is asserted that a certain person is a partner or coowner of the Y. M. C. A., the witness believing for a certain amount and the newspaper merely saying that he was a. stockholder in that association, offset by the assertion of its\u00a0 president that he\u00a0 was not such, no court is\u00a0 capable\u00a0 of rendering judgment declaring that such person is\u00a0 actually a partner or\u00a0 coSwner of the Y. M. C. A., and must pay damages for a culpable action of said association and must in exchange be recognized and admitted as a partner and co5wher\u00a0 of the Y. M. C. A. and as a sharer in the. earnings, profits and advantages thereof.<\/p> <p> Neither could a person\u00a0 be recognized and held out to be the owner of one or\u00a0 more parcels of real estate on the testimony of one witness, the evidence of a newspaper article and the strength of a judgment based upon such testimony and newspaper article, in order that he might be required to pay the land tax and in exchange collect the rents from such property; it is no argument, either pro or con, to say that such person has neither impugned that testimony nor corrected or denied the article published.\u00a0 Should a newspaper publish a list of millionaires and include therein one who is not such, or if a millionaire should figure in a list of paupers, there is no law imposing upon the\u00a0 pauper or the millionaire the duty of denying or correcting the inaccurate report.\u00a0\u00a0 Neither is there any law that creates the presumption that failure to make such correction implies the truth of what\u00a0 is so asserted.\u00a0 It is not a rational and acceptable rule to\u00a0 infer\u00a0 consequences\u00a0 from the failure to correct (whether proper or not) newspaper statements,\u00a0 and still less when in a judicial action such assertion is not substantiated, as has resulted\u00a0 in the case at bar.<\/p> Although Arcadio Arellano may say during a trial, as he has said, once, twice or a hundred times that\u00a0 Galo Lichauco is the proprietor or founder of \"El Renacimiento;\"\u00a0 although \"El Renacimiento\" may have asserted extrajudicially, in an article in reply to another newspaper, that Galo Lichauco is one of the\u00a0 stockholders of the business it conducts;\u00a0 yet when its editor on trial testifies that such report had been secured\u00a0 from mere hearsay among his associates in the newspaper office and not from the organizer,\u00a0 manager or administrator of the newspaper, Martin Ocampo, it can not in justice be concluded that Galo Lichauco is a partner in the business or coowner of\u00a0 the\u00a0 newspaper \"El\u00a0 Renacimiento.\"<br\/> <br\/> <br\/> <hr align=\"center\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/> <div align=\"center\"><br\/> DISSENTING IN PART <\/div> <p> <strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong> <\/p><p> I concur\u00a0 in the\u00a0 foregoing\u00a0 decision of the majority in regard to the defendants Martin Ocampo and Teodoro Kalaw, but dissent from it with reference to the\u00a0 others - Manuel Palma, Arcadio Arellano, Angel Jose, Galo Lichauco, Felipe\u00a0 Barretto, and\u00a0\u00a0 Gregorio\u00a0 Cansipit - for they\u00a0 had neither direct nor indirect participation in the act that gave rise to the present suit for damages, nor were they owners or proprietors\u00a0 of the newspaper \"El\u00a0 Renacimiento,\"\u00a0 its press or other equipment.\u00a0\u00a0 Consequently they are not liable for the damages claimed and should be absolved from the complaint.<\/p> <p> With the exception of Galo Lichauco, who did not pay up the sum he\u00a0 subscribed toward the founding of said newspaper, it is undeniable and clearly proven that the other five - Palma, Arellano, Jose, Barretto, and Cansipit - contributed different\u00a0 sums\u00a0 for\u00a0 the object stated.\u00a0 Martin Ocampo was placed at the head of the business and from the funds he took charge of purchased the press and other necessary equipment for printing and publishing said newspaper.<\/p> <p> It is not conclusively shown in the record that a company was\u00a0 formed to found and publish \"El Renacimiento,\"\u00a0 and divide the earnings\u00a0 and profits among the partners, through a contract entered\u00a0 into, among them,\u00a0 nor that there was established a community of ownership over the said newspaper, its press and the other equipment indispensable for its publication.<\/p> <p> From the fact that the said five individuals contributed, each turning over to Ocampo a certain sum for the purpose of founding, editing and issuing the said newspaper,\u00a0 it is improper to deduce\u00a0 that the contributors formed a company of either a civil or commercial nature, just as it is inadmissible to presume the existence of a company unless it appears that the formation thereof was\u00a0 agreed upon\u00a0 among\u00a0 the partners. Aside from the fact of the contribution, it is not shown in the record that said six contributors had anything to do with acquiring the press, type and other equipment indispensable for getting out the newspaper; that any contract, either verbal or written, as to\u00a0 how and\u00a0 in what manner the\u00a0 publication with its receipts and expenditures should be managed, and in what manner profits should be divided or deficit made up in case of loss; or that at any time meetings\u00a0 were held\u00a0 for discussing\u00a0 the\u00a0 business and dividing the profits, as though they were\u00a0 really in partnership.\u00a0 Up to the time\u00a0 when said newspaper\u00a0 ceased publication, its sole manager, Martin Ocampo, acted freely, just as\u00a0 if he\u00a0 were the absolute owner of the publication,\u00a0 nor does it appear that he ever rendered any report of his acts to\u00a0 those\u00a0 who contributed\u00a0 their money to the founding of \"El Renacimiento.\"<\/p> <p>The six contributors mentioned believed in\u00a0 all good faith that it was necessary, expedient and useful for the rights and interests of the inhabitants of the Philippines to found a newspaper and that out of love and duty to\u00a0 their country they ought to contribute from their private fortunes toward the expenses indispensable thereto, and in so\u00a0 doing unconditionally\u00a0 and with liberality they made a\u00a0 genuine gift, each one freely turning over to Martin Ocampo the amount he could spare.<\/p> <p>The case comes under article 618 of the Civil Code, which says:<\/p> <blockquote> <p>\"A gift is an act of liberality by which a person disposes gratuitously of a thing in favor of another, who accepts it.\"<\/p><\/blockquote> <p> It is true that Martin Ocampo is not the real donee, but considering that such acts\u00a0 of\u00a0 liberality were\u00a0 executed by said six contributors for the common good of\u00a0 the Filipino people and that it\u00a0 was Martin\u00a0 Ocampo\u00a0 who voluntarily undertook\u00a0 to realize and carry out the perfectly legitimate purpose of the\u00a0 contributors,\u00a0 his acceptance of\u00a0 the sums donated, not having been actually repudiated or disapproved by\u00a0 the community, must be understood to\u00a0 have been made in\u00a0 their name, and thus is fulfilled the requirement of acceptance established by the article\u00a0 of the code\u00a0 cited.<br\/> <br\/> According to this theory the donors, after they had freely and spontaneously parted with\u00a0 the sums donated, could not retain any right over the objects\u00a0 to which these sums were applied, because the donor by\u00a0 his gift voluntarily conveys to the donee his rights of ownership over the thing donated. Therefore the said donors can not in strict logic be regarded as the proprietors of the newspaper \"El Renacimiento,\" its press and equipment, because after having\u00a0 turned over the money to Martin Ocampo, who accepted the commission of carrying out the wishes and purposes of the contributors, they retained no right over the newspaper or the press, fixtures and equipment thereof.<br\/> <br\/> Persons who contribute to the erection\u00a0 of a church or a hospital, in spite of the fact that they freely\u00a0 and liberally give money to\u00a0 parties charged\u00a0 with collecting it, do not therefore retain any right, nor can they be called coowners or coproprietors of the church or hospital constructed, and the receipt or\u00a0 acknowledgment\u00a0 of the sums\u00a0 paid to the parties at the head of the\u00a0 enterprise fulfills\u00a0 the requirement of the law, perfects and brings within the legal pale the donation\u00a0 voluntarily made from motives of piety or benevolence.<br\/> <br\/> Such is the case of the said six contributors, who were animated by love of this country in which they were born. Five gave different sums to Martin Ocampo,\u00a0 and a\u00a0 sixth promised to give something,\u00a0 for the founding of \"El Renacimiento,\" believing in good faith that by their acts they, were rendering\u00a0 a meritorious service to their country, but, notwithstanding the internal moral\u00a0 satisfaction they\u00a0 got, as\u00a0 in the case of the benefactors of a church or hospital, they can never be called coSwners or coproprietors of said newspaper.<br\/> <br\/> If, after\u00a0 the\u00a0 establishment of the newspaper, its staff, editor or manager made bad use of the publication and issued a libelous article, the donors who contributed to the funds necessary for\u00a0 the founding of \"El Renacimiento,\" from the very fact that they are not\u00a0 proprietors of the newspaper or of the press\u00a0 from which it is issued, are not liable for the publication of said article, because they did not participate therein\u00a0 either directly Or indirectly, just\u00a0 as in the criminal case\u00a0 they\u00a0 were not indicted\u00a0 even on\u00a0 the ground that they are members of the company that is alleged to have been formed for the establishment of the said newspaper, \"El Renacimiento.\"\u00a0 But this is a theory which, as we\u00a0 hjave already said, we do not admit, because proof is entirely lacking of\u00a0 the\u00a0 existence of that company wherefrom it is attempted to derive the character of owner attrib- uted to\u00a0 the\u00a0 said\u00a0 donees and the consequent obligation\u00a0 to indemnify the plaintiff for the damages claimed.<br\/> <br\/> After Martin Ocampo had accepted the various amounts proffered by the said Palma, Jose, Arellano, Barretto, and Cansipit, these latter ceased\u00a0 to be the owners\u00a0 of and surrendered all\u00a0 right to the money donated and to the objects that were, acquired therewith for the purpose of establishing the newspaper \"El Renacimiento,\" from which business said five individuals, as also Galo Lichauco, are entirely separated.\u00a0 Therefore they can not incur, jointly and severally with the director and manager of \"El Renacimiento,\" the liability\u00a0 to indemnify the plaintiff\u00a0 for the publication therein of an article constituting\u00a0 libel.<br\/> <br\/> Section\u00a0 11 of Act No. 277, applicable to the case,\u00a0 prescribes :<br\/> <br\/> \"In addition to the criminal action\u00a0 hereby prescribed, a\u00a0 right of civil action is also hereby given to\u00a0 any person libeled as hereinbefore set forth against the person libeling him for damages sustained\u00a0 by such libel,\u00a0 and the person so libeled shall be entitled to recover in such\u00a0 civil action not only the actual pecuniary\u00a0 damages sustained by\u00a0 him but also\u00a0 damages for injury to his feelings and reputation, and in addition to such punitive damages as the court may think.will\u00a0 be a just\u00a0 punishment to the libeler\u00a0 and an example to others.\u00a0 Suit\u00a0 may\u00a0 be brought in any\u00a0 Court of First Instance having jurisdiction of the parties.\u00a0 The presumptions, rules\u00a0 of evidence, and special defenses herein provided for criminal prosecutions shall be equally applicable in civil\u00a0 actions under this section.\"<br\/> <br\/> It is certain that lachauco, who merely promised a\u00a0 certain sum, and each of the other five mentioned, who gave the amounts\u00a0 they could\u00a0 spare, did\u00a0 not write, edit, or publish the libelous article that gave rise to\u00a0 this action, neither did they take part\u00a0 directly or indirectly in writing\u00a0 and publishing said article for the purpose\u00a0 of discrediting the plaintiff, and for this reason there does not in our opinion exist any just or legal ground for bringing against them the corresponding civil action for damages, since the mere fact of having contributed from their\u00a0 respective\u00a0 fortunes to the establishment of the newspaper\u00a0 \"El\u00a0 Renacimiento,\" a contribution made in the nature of a gift,\u00a0 and not for the purpose of forming a\u00a0 company for\u00a0 the sake\u00a0 of\u00a0 dividing among themselves earnings and profits,\u00a0 can\u00a0 not in\u00a0 any way have given rise to or produced the obligation to indemnify the plaintiff and\u00a0 place them on a par with those who have injured him by means of a defamatory article, because in making the gifts of money which they did the said six contributing defendants\u00a0 did\u00a0 not acquire, nor do they retain, any right of property or of participation in the said newspaper, its press\u00a0 and equipment.\u00a0 As it does\u00a0 not appear from the record\u00a0 to have\u00a0 been\u00a0 ascertained or proven\u00a0 that they contributed\u00a0 with bad faith and\u00a0 criminal intension to the founding of a newspaper expressly\u00a0 intended to publish libelous articles,\u00a0 or\u00a0 in so doing that they executed\u00a0 acts prohibited by law or contrary to public morality, those who gave money nine years ago for its establishment are certainly not responsible for the bad use that those who wrote and managed\u00a0 said newspaper\u00a0 made of it, especially when the penal action from which the obligation arises was committed many years later, unless it appears that said original donors had knowledge of or participation in the defamatory\u00a0 acts performed.<br\/> <br\/> For\u00a0 these reasons it follows\u00a0 in our opinion that justice requires\u00a0 that the judgment appealed\u00a0 from with regard to the defendants

M. Ibanez de Aldecoa,\u00a0 against Aldecoa &amp;\u00a0 Co., in liquidation, and Isabel Palet y Gabarr6, the said company of\u00a0 Aldecoa &amp; Co., in liquidation, were sentenced to pay to the aforenamed three plaintiffs the sum of P155,127.31 Philippine currency, in the proportion that pertained to each of them in accordance with the investment made in the said company by Isabel Palet y Gabarro, in February, 1897,\u00a0 of P204,184.74, in addition to 6 per cent interest per annum from May 16, 1908, until its complete payment, and to pay the costs, and the defendant Isabel\u00a0 Palet y Gabarro was absolved from the complaint, (Exhibit A.)<\/p><p> On November 30,\u00a0 1909, counsel for the plaintiffs, the said Joaquin, Zoilo, and Cecilia Ibanez de Aldecoa, filed a written complaint, amended on January 4,\u00a0 1910, against the company, The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, Aldecoa &amp; Co., in liquidation, and\u00a0 William\u00a0 Urquhart,\u00a0 the liquidator of the said company, Aldecoa &amp;\u00a0 Co'., in liquidation, wherein he alleged\u00a0 that, by the judgment aforementioned of September 30, 1908, the said sum of P155,127.31, with interest and costs, was\u00a0 awarded to the said plaintiffs, a copy of which judgment was\u00a0 exhibited under letter \"A\" and\u00a0 its contents were made an integral part\u00a0 of the complaint; that, there having been issued the required writ of execution, by reason of the said final judgment, proceedings were had for the attachment of all\u00a0 the property owned by Aldecoa &amp; Co., and that, as a\u00a0 result of the processes of execution counsel for the plaintiffs\u00a0 succeeded in collecting only the sum of P17,022.28, there still remaining a judgment debt in the latter's favor\u00a0 of P149,492.77, in addition to\u00a0 the 6 per cent interest per annum on this sum from August 10, 1909, the date of the last execution; that, on August 14, 1907, the defendant Aldecoa &amp; Co., in liquidation, acquired, through\u00a0 its liquidator Urquhart, the ownership of certain shares or certificates of stock of the company \"Pasay Estate Co., Ltd.,\" numbered 65 to 97, inclusive, in payment or satisfaction of a credit which Aldecoa &amp; Co., had against Alejandro Macleod, the previous owner of the said certificates, all according to the public instrument executed by the parties on the said date of August 14, 1907, a\u00a0 copy of which, marked as Exhibit B, was attached to the record and its contents made an integral part of this allegation; that, according to the plaintiffs' information, the said certificates\u00a0 of\u00a0 shares of \"The\u00a0 Pasay Estate Co., Ltd.\" the property of Aldecoa &amp; Co., were then in the possession and custody of\u00a0 the defendant,\u00a0 The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, which claimed a right of\u00a0 retention over the\u00a0 said certificates by virtue of a certain agreement between\u00a0 its director and manager\u00a0 and the liquidator of Aldecoa &amp; Co., an agreement recorded\u00a0 in\u00a0 a public instrument,\u00a0 a\u00a0 copy of which, exhibited under\u00a0 letter \"C,\"\u00a0 was attached to\u00a0 the record and its contents formed an integral part of\u00a0 this allegation; that the power or authority by virtue of which the liquidator Urquhart apparently\u00a0 had the capacity\u00a0 to execute\u00a0 the said agreement,\u00a0 is\u00a0 specified in a record of proceedings containing the resolutions adopted by the company aforementioned, a copy of which record, exhibited under the letter \"D,\" is attached to the papers in this case and its contents formed an integral part of the complaint; that the\u00a0 defendant,\u00a0 William Urquhart, lacked the express authorization of the members of the company and of the law, as well as the power\u00a0 and authority as liquidator to\u00a0 execute the said agreement, Exhibit C, which, on the contrary, was explicitly\u00a0 prohibited\u00a0 by the law, was a violation of the provisions thereof, and, consequently,\u00a0 was a contract null and void in itself,\u00a0 inoperative and without value or\u00a0 effect, because it tended to\u00a0 convert the defendant bank into an exceptionally privileged creditor with prejudice and fraud toward the other creditors of Aldecoa &amp; Co., among\u00a0 whom were the plaintiffs.\u00a0 The\u00a0 latter,\u00a0 on these grounds, petitioned the\u00a0 court,\u00a0 in the\u00a0 supplementary proceedings of execution of that final judgment,\u00a0 to order the company, The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, to\u00a0 deposit the said certificates with the court\u00a0 and that the same be sold at public auction in order to apply the product of the sale to the said judgment; but The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank opposed the\u00a0 said petition on the ground that, by reason of the contract, Exhibit C,\u00a0 the said certificates had been delivered by the liquidator of Aldecoa &amp; Co. to the bank as an additional security to that previously given in behalf of the same by Aldecoa &amp; Co. to guarantee the payment of a credit which the former, the defendant bank, held against the latter.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 The court denied the\u00a0 plaintiffs'\u00a0 petition, but authorized them to bring the proper action\u00a0 for the\u00a0 recovery of the said certificates.\u00a0 Counsel for the plaintiffs,\u00a0 therefore, asked for a judgment in behalf of his clients, against the defendants, by finding: (<em>a<\/em>) That the agreement contained\u00a0 in the document, Exhibit\u00a0 C,\u00a0 executed by\u00a0 the liquidator Urquhart in favor of The Hongkong and Shanghai\u00a0 Bank, was in itself null and\u00a0 void; (<em>b<\/em>) that the\u00a0 certificates, Nos. 65 to 97, of The Pasay Estate Co., Ltd., belonged\u00a0 to Aldecoa &amp; Co., and that the said bank did not acquire and did not have any title, right or interest whatever in the said certificates; and\u00a0 (<em>c<\/em>) that the sheriff of Manila should take\u00a0 possession of the said certificates and sell them in execution of the judgment rendered in the civil case No. 6087 of the\u00a0 Court of First\u00a0 Instance.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>The demurrer interposed by\u00a0 counsel\u00a0 for The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank against the complaint having been overruled by an order of February 10, and an exception\u00a0 thereto taken by the said bank, <em>counsel for Aldecoa &amp; Co.<\/em>, in liquidation, <em>in its answer to the previous complaint<\/em>, denied each and all of the allegations therein contained.<\/p><p> Counsel for The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, answering the previous amended complaint by a writing of February 17, 1910, set forth a general and special denial of each and all of the allegations contained in the said amended complaint and, by a second distinct and separate answer, stated and alleged that he admitted the allegations\u00a0 contained in paragraphs 1,\u00a0 2, 3, and 4 of the amended complaint and denied each and all of the other allegations of the same; that, on\u00a0 January 24, 1907, a meeting was held of the members of the firm of Aldecoa &amp; Co. for the purpose of deciding upon the ways and means of effecting the liquidation of the said company, in which meeting the members decided upon the matter of the liquidation, as shown by the minutes and the registration of the same in the mercantile registry book of the firm, a copy of the said minutes being attached, containing the\u00a0 resolution referred to, which, as Exhibit A, was made an integral part of the answer; that, subsequent to <em>June 13,1907,<\/em> on which date the said firm was in course of liquidation,; <em>a certain agreement was made and executed<\/em> by and between Joaquin and Zoilo Ibanez de Aldecoa y Palet, and Isabel Palet y Gabarro, the widow of\u00a0 Aldecoa,\u00a0 all parties of the first part, the firm of Aldecoa &amp;\u00a0 Co., in liquidation, parties of the second part, and the firm of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, party of the third part, by which agreement the parties of the first and second parts stipulated that\u00a0 they would apply, in their totality to the payment <em>pro tanto<\/em> of the credit which Aldecoa &amp; Co., in liquidation, was owing to the\u00a0 party\u00a0 of the third part, all\u00a0 the products of a certain suit which was about to be brought by\u00a0 Aldecoa &amp; Co., in liquidation, against Alejandro S. Macleod re several shares of the company, \"The Pasay Estate Co., Ltd.,\" which shares were those numbered 65 to 97, referred to in the complaint, <em>a copy of the said agreement, marked as Exhibit B,<\/em> being attached to and made a part of the answer; that, on August 14, 1907, after suit had been filed by Aldecoa &amp; Co., in liquidation,\u00a0 against Alejandro S. Macleod re the said shares of \"The Pasay Estate Co.,\u00a0 Ltd.,\"<em>a compromise<\/em>\u00a0 was had, shown in\u00a0 a document executed between the parties on the said 14th day of August; that, on the same date, Aldecoa &amp; Co. executed jointly with The\u00a0 Hongkong and Shanghai Bank a written agreement whereby it was expressly stipulated that nothing contained in the instrument of compromise\u00a0 should be considered or construed as a modification, novation, rescission or revocation of a contract duly executed on <em>June 13, 1907,<\/em> a copy of which, marked <em>Exhibit B,<\/em> was\u00a0 attached to the answer, by which contract or agreement Aldecoa &amp; Co. recognized and confirmed its obligation to deliver the shares aforementioned, together with their dividends, to The Hongkong and Shanghai\u00a0 Bank in accordance with the terms of the said\u00a0 agreement, there being attached\u00a0 the instrument of agreement of August 14,1904, marked Exhibit C, and which was made an integral part of the said separate answer; that, on\u00a0 August\u00a0 30,\u00a0 1907, by virtue of\u00a0 the said\u00a0 agreements, Aldecoa &amp;\u00a0 Co.,\u00a0 in\u00a0 liquidation, executed\u00a0 an instrument whereby it pledged the said shares of the company\u00a0 \"The Pasay Estate Co., Ltd.,\"\u00a0 numbered 65 to 97, to The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, a copy of the said instrument being attached, under Exhibit D, and\u00a0 made an integral part of the answer; and that, at the date of the answer and\u00a0 at all times since August 30, 1907, The Hongkong\u00a0 and Shanghai Bank was holding and keeping, and had held and kept, in its possession the said shares,\u00a0 for the purposes of the mortgage contained in the instrument marked Exhibit D, which mortgage had never been formally cancelled, rescinded or revoked and was still valid and\u00a0 in force. Counsel for the defendant bank therefore prayed that judgment\u00a0 be rendered by absolving his client from the amended complaint and sentencing the plaintiffs to\u00a0 the\u00a0 payment of the costs of the suit.<\/p><p> On\u00a0 Apirl 11,\u00a0 1910, counsel for the plaintiffs presented a written motion for\u00a0 an amendment to the\u00a0 complaint,\u00a0 previously amended on the 4th\u00a0 of January of the same year, by adding to paragraph 1 thereof the following statement: The plaintiff <em>Zoilo Ibanez de Aldecoa<\/em> was during the entire year 1907 a minor <em>23 years of age<\/em> and had no guardian for\u00a0\u00a0 his property nor was provided with any legal representation for the administration, alienation or disposal of his property and interests.<\/p><p> The defendant, The\u00a0 Hongkong and\u00a0 Shanghai Banking Corporation, interposed a demurrer to the second amended complaint, alleging that the facts set forth therein did not. constitute a right of action against it, and therefore prayed that it be\u00a0 absolved from the complaint, with the\u00a0 costs against the adverse party.\u00a0 This demurrer was overruled by an order of April 18 of the same year and an exception was entered by the defendant bank.<\/p><p> Counsel for the latter, in answer to the second amended complaint, set forth in a writing of April 18, 1910: that he generally and specifically denied each and all of the allegations contained in the said second amended complaint, and the latter in its entirety, and that, by a second separate and distinct answer, he denied each and all of the allegations contained in the first paragraph of the second amended complaint; and, answering particularly\u00a0 with respect to the subject matter of the said first paragraph, he alleged:\u00a0 that, prior to June 13, 1907, to wit, in 1903, the plaintiff\u00a0 Zoilo Ibanez de\u00a0 Aldecoa was\u00a0 duly and legally emancipated\u00a0 by his mother and was, by virtue of such emancipation, on the date aforesaid of\u00a0 June 13, 1907, qualified to manage his property,\u00a0 as if he were of age;\u00a0 that the defendant\u00a0 bank admitted the allegations contained in the second, third and fourth paragraphs\u00a0 of the said second amended complaint and denied all the other allegations of the latter; that,\u00a0 on January 24,1907, a meeting was held of the members of the firm of Aldecoa and Company for the purpose of determining upon the ways and means of effecting its liquidation,\u00a0 in which meeting such members passed various resolutions,\u00a0 as shown\u00a0 by the minutes of the meeting\u00a0 and the registered record\u00a0 of the same in the mercantile register of this\u00a0 city, a copy of which was attached to the original answer, marked as Exhibit A and made an integral part of this answer;\u00a0 that, subsequent to the date aforecited of June 13,\u00a0 on which the firm of Aldecoa &amp; Co. was in the course of liquidation, a certain agreement was made and executed between Joaquin Ibanez de Aldecoa y Palet, Zoilo Ibanez de Aldecoa y Palet, and Isabel Palet y Gabarro, the widow of Aldecoa, all parties of the first part, Aldecoa &amp; Co., in liquidation, party of the second part and The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, party of the third part, by which agreement it was stipulated\u00a0 by the interested parties of\u00a0 the\u00a0 first and the second parts that they would devote in their entirety to the payment <em>pro tanto<\/em> of\u00a0 the credit which Aldecoa &amp;\u00a0 Co., in liquidation, was owing to the entity, the party of the third part, all the products\u00a0 of\u00a0 the suit which was about to\u00a0 be brought by Aldecoa &amp; Co. against Alejandro S. Macleod re several shares of the company known as \"The Pasay Estate Co.\u00a0 Ltd.,\" which were referred to in the complaint and marked as Exhibits Nos. 65 to 97, inclusive, a copy of the said agreement being\u00a0 attached, under\u00a0 Exhibit\u00a0 B,\u00a0 to the original answer and made an integral part of this answer to the\u00a0 second amended complaint; that, on August 14, 1907, after Aldecoa &amp; Co. had instituted suit against\u00a0 Alejandro S. Macleod\u00a0 in\u00a0 re the\u00a0 said\u00a0 shares of \"The Pasay\u00a0 Estate Co. Ltd.,\" a compromise therein was reached, according to an agreement made on the same date between the litigating parties; that, on the same\u00a0 date of August 14, 1907, Aldecoa &amp; Co., in liquidation, made a written agreement with The Hongkong and\u00a0 Shanghai Banking Corporation, whereby it was expressly stipulated that nothing contained in the said instrument of compromise should be considered or construed as a modification, novation, rescission or revocation of the contract duly executed\u00a0 on June 13, 1907, a copy of\u00a0 which, as Exhibit B, was attached to this answer, in which contract Aldecoa &amp; Co.,\u00a0 in liquidation, recognized and\u00a0 confirmed its obligation to deliver the shares referred to and their corresponding dividends, to The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, a copy of the said agreement of August 14, 1904, marked Exhibit C, being attached to the original answer and made an integral part of this\u00a0 one; and that, on August 30, 1907, by virtue of the aforementioned agreements, Aldecoa &amp; Co., in liquidation, executed\u00a0 an instrument whereby it pledged\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the said shares of \"The Pasay Estate Co. Ltd.,\" designated as Exhibits Nos. 65 to 97, inclusive, to the entity, The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, a copy of the said instrument of August 30,1907, being annexed, as Exhibit D, to the original answer and made an integral part of this one.\u00a0 Counsel for the bank therefore asked that judgment be rendered by absolving his client from the second amended complaint and sentencing the\u00a0 plaintiffs to the payment of the costs of the suit.<\/p><p> The case having come to trial, the documents, papers and records of proceedings presented in\u00a0 evidence by the parties being attached to the record, the court, on August 31, 1910, pronounced judgment wherein he found that the agreement was null and\u00a0 void which on June 30 (it should be August), 1907, was executed by William Urquhart, as the\u00a0 liquidator of Aldecoa &amp; Co., and by which a pledge, or mortgage as termed in the judgment, was, as an additional security for the credit of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation against Aldecoa &amp; Co., constituted upon the said shares of \"The Pasay Estate Co. Ltd.;\" declared and\u00a0 recognized to belong to the latter company by virtue of the instrument of compromise e'xecuted by Alejandro S. Macleod on August 14, 1907, which certificates or shares were delivered over to the said\u00a0 bank for their keeping and\u00a0 preservation.\u00a0 The judgment further ordered that the said bank should deliver the said certificates to the sheriff of Manila, as assets of Aldecoa &amp; Co., in liquidation, susceptible of judgment execution, without prejudice to any right of preferred\u00a0 claim thereto which might be raised between the parties upon different and distinct grounds from those argued in the present suit.\u00a0 No\u00a0 special assessment was made of the\u00a0 costs.\u00a0 To this judgment an exception was entered by the defendant, The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, which, by written motion,' prayed for the\u00a0 annulment of the said judgment and a\u00a0 new trial, on the ground that the former was not supported by the\u00a0 evidence, was contrary to law, and the findings\u00a0 of fact therein contained were openly and manifestly at variance with the evidence.\u00a0 This motion was overruled by an order of December 1st of the same year, and an exception thereto was saved by the defendant party who duly filed the proper\u00a0 bill\u00a0 of exceptions\u00a0 which was certified\u00a0 and forwarded, with a transcript of the evidence, to the clerk of this court.<\/p><p> Various are the\u00a0 questions of fact and of law\u00a0 which have been the subject matter of argument in this\u00a0 litigation, but, restricting ourselves to the terms of the complaint and of the judgment appealed from, the main issue\u00a0 which this court is called upon to decide in this instance is that as to whether\u00a0 or not the agreement contained in the instrument designated as Exhibit\u00a0 C by\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiiff\u00a0 party and\u00a0 as Exhibit D by the defendant party, executed\u00a0 on August 30, 1907, by and between the liquidator of the firm of Aldecoa &amp; Co. and the maiiager of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, should be annulled.<\/p><p> The\u00a0 said\u00a0 instrument sets forth as the reasons\u00a0 for\u00a0 its execution that on\u00a0 February 23,\u00a0 1906, The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and Aldecoa &amp; Co. entered into a contractual agreement whereby the said bank bound itself to\u00a0 open and maintain in behalf of Aldecoa &amp; Co. a credit in account current up to the sum of P475,000,\u00a0 in accordance with the conditions and securities detailed in\u00a0 an instrument of the said date; that,\u00a0 subsequently, the contracting\u00a0 parties also agreed that, should certain shares\u00a0 of the concern,\u00a0 \"The\u00a0 Pasay Estate Co.

Ltd.,\" should be delivered to it in payment or partial satisfaction of its considerable credit of P475,000, was satisfied, in the said subsequent instrument of August 30, to\u00a0 receive the said shares in pledge, for their custody and preservation\u00a0 as\u00a0 an\u00a0 additional\u00a0 security\u00a0 for\u00a0 the\u00a0 aforementioned credit and an amplification of the security given\u00a0 in\u00a0 the mortgage of February 23, 1906, executed by Aldecoa &amp; Co. and by these very plaintiffs.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 The latter have not impugned the agreement of June 13, 1907, into which they entered and became interested parties obligated to comply with the stipulations thereof, although the said agreement contains more positive advantages\u00a0 in behalf of The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, and had it been carried out the plaintiffs would perhaps not have had so much as a hope of collecting their credit against Aldecoa &amp; Co.\u00a0 out of the value of those shares, because then this firm would\u00a0 have ceased absolutely to be the owner of the said shares\u00a0 of \"The Pasay Estate Co. Ltd.\"\u00a0 The plaintiffs seek the nullification of the subsequent contract of August 30, whereby the\u00a0 creditor bank was\u00a0 satisfied to keep as a pledge the said shares, and allege incalculable injury which has no reason for existence, for, though the right they have to collect the sum of P149,422.77 out of the assets of Aldecoa &amp;\u00a0 Co. is\u00a0 founded on the final judgment\u00a0 rendered on September 30, 1908, in case No.\u00a0 6087 prosecuted\u00a0 by them against Aldecoa &amp; Co., in liquidation,\u00a0 and Isabel Palet y Gabarro, yet it must be taken into account that in the case just cited the representative of The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank was not a party and did not intervene, and that the mortgage credit\u00a0 of this\u00a0 latter concern against\u00a0 Aldecoa &amp; Co.\u00a0 and the plaintiffs is set forth in an instrument of February 23, 1906 - a prior date to that of the\u00a0 said judgment; aside from the fact that the credit held by the plaintiffs is not recorded in any instrument whatever of a public character. <br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 The\u00a0 circumstance that the plaintiffs now hold a\u00a0 final judgment for the collection of their credit out of the assets of Aldecoa &amp; Co., they having no duly executed mortgage or pledge on any determinate property of the debtor\u00a0 firm, can not\u00a0 give them a preferred right over The\u00a0 Hongkong and Shanghai Bank which has in its possession the shares in question, and holds them as a pledge and enlargement of security\u00a0 for\u00a0 its\u00a0 considerable\u00a0 mortgage\u00a0 credit\u00a0 of\u00a0 more preferred right than the said credit\u00a0 of the plaintiffs who, as aforesaid, had a recognition of this fact inscribed in the contract drawn up in the instrument of June 13, 1907, in which they intervened as one of the three contracting parties thereof.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 In\u00a0 order that the plaintiffs may allege\u00a0 that they have been prejudiced by the contract contained in the instrument executed on August 30, 1907, it is indispensable for them to show that they had a preferred right especially to the said shares of \"The Pasay Estate Co. Ltd.,\" and which was trampled under foot and defrauded by the contract of August 80, wherein they had no interest and were not parties obligated principally or subsidiarily; but since this latter contract or agreement is much less advantageous to The Hongkong and Shanghai\u00a0 Bank than the previous one of June 13, in which the plaintiffs intervened as one of the parties to the contract, conviction is acquired of the groundlessness and unreasonableness of the said plaintiffs' claim, precisely because they were unable to allege or to show that they had a better right than The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank and that, by the execution of the contract of August 30 between Aldecoa &amp; Co. and the bank, they were prejudiced in their rights and interests.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 In order that once for all it may appear what is and in what consists the right\u00a0 acquired by The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank to the said shares of \"The Pasay Estate Co. Ltd.,\"\u00a0 it is necessary to consider that Aldecoa &amp; Co., in liquidation, would not\u00a0 have succeeded in recovering these shares were it hot for the intervention of, and the P50,000 bond\u00a0 given by, The Hongkong and Shanhai Banking Corporation, as related in full in the instrument of August 14, 1907, found on page 9 of\u00a0 the bill of exceptions, from Which it appears that, through a compromise agreement made and entered into by and between\u00a0 the defendant Alejandro S. Macleod, the holder\u00a0 of the said shares, the party of the first part and the firm of Aldecoa &amp; Co. and The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, the parties of the second part, and for\u00a0 the purpose of compliance therewith, the condition had to be fulfilled that was required by the defendant\u00a0 Macleod,\u00a0 to wit, that both Aldecoa\u00a0 &amp;\u00a0 Co.\u00a0 and The\u00a0 Hongkong\u00a0 and Shanghai Bank\u00a0 should desist from their claims and\u00a0 the latter\u00a0 should\u00a0 effect a dissolution of. the injunction which prevented Macleod and his wife from disposing of certain promissory notes referred to in\u00a0 the said compromise agreement.<\/p><p> As may be seen by the terms of the latter, all the property surrendered by Alejandro S. Macleod and his wife, such as the shares in question, the pro indiviso parcel of real estate, the credits against the widow and children of the deceased Escano and the balance owing Macleod, was transferred to Aldecoa &amp; Co., without The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank having obtained either property or credits in compensation for the renunciation and surrender\u00a0 that it had made, and only in the instrument of the same date, August 14, executed by\u00a0 and between the liquidator\u00a0 of Aldecoa &amp; Co. and\u00a0 the agent\u00a0 of the said banking corporation,\u00a0 was\u00a0 it covenanted that the stipulation of the\u00a0 contract set forth in the instrument of June 13th should be carried out, to the effect that the said shares with their corresponding dividend should be delivered to the bank aforementioned,\u00a0 without prejudice to the contract which the interested parties might subsequently make for the purpose of crediting their value in the balance, leaving the shares in question as an\u00a0 additional security\u00a0 for the debt of Aldecoa &amp; Co.\u00a0 Such is the sole positive benefit obtained by The Hongkong and\u00a0 Shanghai Bank in the said transaction\u00a0 with\u00a0 Alejandro\u00a0 S. Macleod and his\u00a0 wife, according to the instrument\u00a0 of August\u00a0 14,\u00a0 1907, and\u00a0 in exchange therefor it had to give a bond of 50,000 pesos to guarantee the liability of\u00a0 Aldecoa\u00a0 &amp; Co., in liquidation, before the courts.<\/p><p> With regard to whether the\u00a0 liquidator, William\u00a0 Urquhart, had or did not have the power to execute the contract drawn up on August 30, 1907 - the plaintiffs deny that he had it\u00a0 and founded their petition for nullity on the alleged absence of such power - it is of the highest interest, for the elucidation of this\u00a0 point,\u00a0 first to proceed to examine the authority and power conferred upon the liquidator Urquhart by the\u00a0 members of the firm of Aldecoa &amp; Co., in liquidation, as shown by the minutes of\u00a0 the meeting held by them in this city on January 24, 1907, and which as Exhibit A, are of record on page 39 of the bill of exceptions.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 It appears in the said minutes that the liquidator Urquhart was authorized:\u00a0 (<em>b<\/em>) To treat with The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation in order that it might assist him in the liquidation by his obtaining the sum he might need for the payment of debts and the maintenance of the proceedings of liquidation, he being vested with the power to execute whatever public or private documents might be necessary or advantageous for the purpose of carrying out any agreement between Aldecoa &amp; Co. and the said bank; (<em>c<\/em>) to sue the debtors of the firm to enforce immediate payment; (<em>f<\/em>) to\u00a0 compromise questions and\u00a0 suits, whenever\u00a0 thereby some advantage might accrue to the members and\u00a0 their creditors; (<em>g<\/em>)\u00a0 to\u00a0 award, in payment of\u00a0 debts, property, rights\u00a0 and shares of the firm of Aldecoa &amp; Co.; (<em>h<\/em>) to sell real and chattel property belonging to the company, at the most suitable prices payable\u00a0 in cash or on time and secured by mortgages or by pledges;\u00a0 (<em>i<\/em>) to represent the liquidation before\u00a0 the courts by exercising all the proper actions and by\u00a0 performing and carrying out every\u00a0 necessary act and proceeding until the\u00a0 final determination of the litigation, it being understood that the authority and power conferred upon the said liquidator by resolution adopted by the members of the firm aforementioned, shall not be interpreted as limiting or restricting in any manner the\u00a0 power vested in him by the Code of Commerce.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>The\u00a0 liquidator, availing himself of the authority granted him in\u00a0 clause (<em>b<\/em>) above cited, applied to The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank for a bond of fifty thousand pesos in order to recover from Alejandro S.\u00a0 Macleod the shares in question, by virtue of the powers (<em>c<\/em>), (d)\u00a0 and (<em>f<\/em>), aforementioned, find the bank,\u00a0 upon giving\u00a0 the\u00a0 said\u00a0 bond, required\u00a0 as a condition, at first,\u00a0 that set forth in the instrument of June 13,\u00a0 and afterward, the less\u00a0 onerous\u00a0 one stipulated\u00a0 in the instrument of August 30.\u00a0 It is therefore neither reasonable nor just to assert that the said liquidator in his acts overstepped his power\u00a0 and authority and\u00a0 was wholly unauthorized to mortgage the shares concerned to the bank, because he\u00a0 obliged\u00a0 himself in\u00a0 a\u00a0 lesser manner\u00a0 than\u00a0 he was authorized by clause\u00a0 (<em>g<\/em>),\u00a0 above, mentioned, and it is indisputable that he who may sell is\u00a0 authorized to give in pledge property of the firm for which he is the liquidator.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>Is it possible to believe,\u00a0 in the natural course of things, that The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank would have been willing to an increase\u00a0 of the debt of Aldecoa &amp; Co. or to have contracted in behalf of the latter, liabilities,\u00a0 without the safeguard of\u00a0 any\u00a0 security whatever?\u00a0\u00a0 The plaintiffs know, of course, that it is not, as they were one of the three parties who executed the aforesaid instrument of June 13, 1907, in the second clause of which provision is made for the liability that might be incurred by the said banking corporation on account of the bond it had given.<\/p><p> If the liquidator had not employed due diligence to recover the said shares, the same would\u00a0 not\u00a0 have entered into the assets of Aldecoa &amp; Co. and then, assuredly, he would have contracted liability through a failure to comply with his duty.\u00a0 However, all the efforts exerted by the liquidator to recover those shares would\u00a0 have been useless if The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank had not given the P50,000 bond.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>Just as\u00a0 the judgment appealed from uselessly took up the nature and conditions of the contract ratified on June 13, 1907, between\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiffs Aldecoa &amp; Co. and\u00a0 The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, for the simple\u00a0 reason that said plaintiffs did not claim nullity thereof but of the contract of August\u00a0 30 following, so this decision must not touch upon that contract of June 13; and if mention has necessarily been made thereof in the foregoing discussion it is due to the close relation that exists among the contracts\u00a0 recorded in the instrument of June 13,\u00a0 the\u00a0 two of August 14, one of which latter\u00a0 contains the\u00a0 transaction whereby the shares of \"The Pasay Estate Co., Ltd.\" were recovered,\u00a0 and\u00a0 that of August 30, the only\u00a0 one impugned by the plaintiffs.<\/p><p> No just reason nor legal ground is offered whereby it may be affirmed that the contract duly executed on August 30, 1907, is, on account of its being a rectification of the prior ppe of June 13th of the same year, null and void in itself and of no legal value, since such rectification solely concerns the rights of The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank and in no wise affects the obligation contracted by the plaintiffs in the before mentioned instrument of June 13.\u00a0 On the contrary, the\u00a0 renunciation made by the creditor\u00a0 bank to collect, by the surrender of the said shares, a part of its credit, is favorable to Aldecoa &amp; Co., which\u00a0 firm succeeded in reserving to itself the right to sell those shares and to apply their price, without dividends\u00a0 and\u00a0 profits, toward paying off\u00a0 its mortgage debt to the\u00a0 said\u00a0 bank,\u00a0 and this benefit stood\u00a0 likewise\u00a0 in\u00a0 behalf\u00a0 of the plaintiffs, as\u00a0 the mortgage bondsmen of the said firm in securing the debt to the bank, and also as creditors of the former, for, had not the bank made the said renunciation contained in the instrument of August 30 and had it collected a part of its credit, keeping the shares that had been surrendered to it by the contract of June 13, there would have been no dividends nor profits from the shares in litigation, alloted to the amortization and reduction of the debt of which the plaintiffs are sureties, and no hope of selling such shares at a price perhaps in excess of their present value.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>Even on the hypothesis that the contract\u00a0 of August 30, 1907, the only\u00a0 one impugned by the plaintiff party, were held to be null and void, the other prior contract of June 13 of the same year would still subsist in full force\u00a0 and effect and whereby Aldecoa &amp; Co. and the\u00a0 plaintiffs covenanted and agreed that The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank should collect a part of its credit by applying to the amortization of the same the shares in question, an operation which the plaintiffs, who took part and\u00a0 obligated themselves in the said contract, can not repudiate or deny; therefore, once it is proved\u00a0 that the\u00a0 liquidator, in executing the\u00a0 contract of August 80, acted within and in accordance with the powers which were conferred upon him by the members of the firm\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 of Aldecoa &amp; Co., and it is not shown that the plaintiffs had a better right than the bank to the shares in litigation, or that they suffered detriment and damage as a result of the contract of August 30, it is not lawful nor can\u00a0 it be countenanced that there be a successful issue to the plaintiffs' demand, to wit, that, after a declaration of nullity of the said contract of August 30, the shares of \"The Pasay Estate Co. Ltd.,\" be\u00a0 sold by the sheriff and the proceeds of the sale applied to the payment of the sum which Aldecoa &amp; Co. owe the plaintiffs, because this, were it done, would be a complete violation of the\u00a0 prior contract of June 13, which was not broken\u00a0 by the bank, and of the renunciation made by the latter corporation to collect a part\u00a0 of its credit out of the Value of the\u00a0 said shares surrendered to it.\u00a0\u00a0 If any injury was occasioned, it would not be to the plaintiffs, but to the creditor bank itself.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 In the course of our reasoning in\u00a0 previous paragraphs\u00a0 of this decision,\u00a0 we maintained that the contract of August 30 shows no defect\u00a0 whatever of those which, according to the law, invalidate contracts executed pursuant to the requisites specified in article 1261 of the Civil Code, and that the plaintiffs had not the rights and the personality to\u00a0 have enabled them to prosecute the action for the nullity of the said\u00a0 contract of August 30. Let us see whether this contract\u00a0 is susceptible of recission and whether it may\u00a0 be\u00a0 comprised within any of the cases specified in\u00a0 the law, though it\u00a0 does not appear that\u00a0 an action for rescission was exercised in this suit.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>Article 1291 of the Civil\u00a0 Code prescribes:<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>\"The following may be rescinded:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"1.

Any other contracts specially determined by law.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>A mere perusal of the five paragraphs of the preinserted article shows that the contract of August 30, executed by and between Aldecoa &amp; Co. and The Hongkong and Sanghai Bank, is not comprised within any of the cases of rescission specified in the code, nor does it appear to be specially determined by law as susceptible of rescission, inasmuch as the bank's having been satisfied to hold and keep in\u00a0 its possession the shares in question,\u00a0 as a\u00a0 pledge, instead of having applied them to the\u00a0 payment of a part of its credit, as\u00a0 it was allowed to do in the beginning, does not bring the case within the\u00a0 scope of those enumerated in the said article 1291 and which require\u00a0 rescission, and much less does\u00a0 it establish that that contract\u00a0 of August 30 was executed in fraud of the plaintiffs as creditors of Aldecoa &amp; Co. because it must be taken into account that their credit, prior to the judgment of September 30,\u00a0 1908, whereby Aldecoa &amp; Co., in liquidation, were\u00a0 sentenced to pay the same, was of\u00a0 a common and simple character and was not recorded in any document of a public nature, while the credit of The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank against the aforesaid firm reaches an amount more than three times greater\u00a0 than that of the plaintiffs' credit and is recorded in a public instrument of the date of February 23,\u00a0 1906, long prior to the\u00a0 said judgment of the Court of First Instance, and\u00a0 is secured by mortgage upon several improved properties belonging to the plaintiffs and to their mother, Isabel Palet.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 With\u00a0 respect to\u00a0 the nature and effects of the judgment before mentioned of\u00a0 September 30, 1908,\u00a0 in behalf of\u00a0 the\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 plaintiffs and against Aldecoa &amp; Co., we quote section 277 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which provides:<\/p><p> \"The\u00a0 rights of a party\u00a0 can\u00a0 not be prejudiced by the declaration, act or omission of another,\u00a0 except by virtue of a particular relation between them, as hereinafter stated; therefore proceedings against one can not affect another.\"<\/p><p> It has not been shown that there exists any special relation such as constitutes the exception provided for in the above section, between the plaintiffs, Aldecoa &amp; Co. and The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, in respect to the debt of Aldecoa &amp; Co. to the plaintiffs; therefore,\u00a0 whatever may be the nature and effects of the judgment obtained by the latter against the former, that judgment can not affect The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, nor produce, with respect thereto, the results derived from <em>res adjudicata<\/em>.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 As to the lapse of the term fixed for the payment of the amount\u00a0 referred to in\u00a0 the mortgage instrument\u00a0 of February 23, 1906, although it is indifferent whether\u00a0 the said term has or has not expired and the credit were not demandable before the 24th of February, 1911, with respect to the contract of August 30, in view of the terms and conditions stipulated in this instrument, since it does not concern the surrender, as a payment, of the said shares of \"The Pasay Estate Co., Ltd.,\" but merely their delivery in pledge as an additional security for the said credit of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank; yet, withal, it is pertinent for the purposes of this decision to state that Aldecoa &amp;\u00a0 Co., according to paragraph 7 of the said instrument of February 23, 1906, was obligated to amortize its debit\u00a0 balance by the payment of a minimum sum of P50,000 per annum on or before December 31, 1906, until\u00a0 its debt should be reduced on January 1, 1911, to P225,000, it being understood that the annuities for the amortization at the rate of P50,000 a year should begin to run from January 1, 1906, and\u00a0 be paid successively until December 31,1910, in such manner that on January 1, 1911, the debt should\u00a0 not exceed P225,000; the payments, therefore, as has been seen, were to be partial and were to fall due on successive dates, it having been stipulated , however, in clause 13, that in case of failure of payment the creditor bank should not demand the sale of the mortgaged properties until after the lapse of five years from the date of the contract.\u00a0 So that the term for the gradual payment of the credit\u00a0 of P475,000 is one of. successive installments and is distinct from the term fixed within which, for failure of payment, the sale of the mortgaged properties might be demanded; and, finally, upon the petition of the bank - the only party interested, as\u00a0 is logical, in having its interests safeguarded and secured - and not at the request of the liquidator, the plaintiffs intervened in the contract drawn up in the instrument of June 13, 1907, for the reason set forth in clause 2 thereof, to wit,\u00a0 that in case that the creditor bank\u00a0 should incur liability\u00a0 on account of the said P50,000 bond, the obligation assumed by Aldecoa &amp; Co. to indemnify it, should be\u00a0 aggregated to the amount of the said credit\u00a0 and its payment to the bank secured by the same mortgages stipulated in the instrument of February\u00a0 23, 1906;\u00a0 and as\u00a0 the mortgage sureties\u00a0 were, among others, the plaintiffs themselves, the representative of The Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank rightly required that the defendants should take part,\u00a0 as they did, in the said instrument of June 13, whereby it was\u00a0 stipulated that the latter's bond should likewise respond for the liability\u00a0 which might be incurred by The Hongkong &amp; Shanghai\u00a0 Bank on account of the bond given for\u00a0 the recovery of the said\u00a0 shares of \"The Pasay Estate Co., Ltd.\"<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 For the foregoing reasons, it is proper, in our opinion, to decide,\u00a0 as we\u00a0 hereby do, with a reversal of the judgment appealed\u00a0 from of August 31, 1910,\u00a0 that there\u00a0 are\u00a0 no grounds upon\u00a0 which to hold that the contract contained in the instrument of August 30th is null and void, and the defendants, The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation\u00a0 and Aldecoa\u00a0 &amp;

It was error to admit as evidence for the prosecution the\u00a0 exhibits presented by the fiscal.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"2. It was error\u00a0 to overrule the motion of the\u00a0 defense that the\u00a0 official record of the justice of the peace regarding the declarations made by the\u00a0 witnesses in the preliminary investigation of this case be annexed to the papers in this cause.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"3. It\u00a0 was error to sentence the accused to pay the excessive fine of P300 each.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"4. It was error\u00a0 to find that the accused played <em>monte<\/em> with\u00a0 bets of money in\u00a0 the house of\u00a0 Cayetano Rafael, and that they are guilty\u00a0 of the crime charged.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>With reference to\u00a0 the first assignment of error, the policeman who arrested the defendants at or about the time when they were found gambling in the house of Cayetano Rafael, took possession of tally-sheets, lead pencils, and other things which they believed had been used in connection with\u00a0 the game of monte, which the defendants had been playing.\u00a0\u00a0 If it is true that these objects had been used in connection with the gambling game, they would be admissible in evidence, after having been properly identified.\u00a0\u00a0 A careful reading of the decision of the lower court, however, indicates\u00a0 that he based his conclusion that the defendants were guilty of\u00a0 the crime charged upon the fact that the defendants had actually been caught in the\u00a0 act of gambling\u00a0 and that he gave no credit whatever to the exhibits in question.\u00a0 In other words, the lower court found that there was sufficient evidence to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendants were playing at a prohibited game at the time in question without any reference to these\u00a0 exhibits.\u00a0 The mere fact that\u00a0 the tally-sheets, lead pencils and other things had been found at the time the defendants were seen gambling, could in no way furnish additional\u00a0 proof that two or three\u00a0 witnesses presented by the\u00a0 prosecution had actually seen the defendants engaged\u00a0 in\u00a0 playing the prohibited game\u00a0 of\u00a0 monte. Generally there is certain paraphernalia used in playing the prohibited game of monte.\u00a0\u00a0 This\u00a0 paraphernalia, however,\u00a0 is not a necessary part of the game.\u00a0\u00a0 It is\u00a0 only a convenience.\u00a0 When the particular paraphernalia is found, however, it of itself may furnish some evidence, although not conclusive, that\u00a0 the parties using it had been playing the prohibited game.\u00a0 But when there were\u00a0 eyewitnesses to the playing of\u00a0 the prohibited game, the existence of the paraphernalia could only be corroborative.\u00a0 It was not shown\u00a0 during\u00a0 the\u00a0 trial of the cause that the\u00a0 tally-sheets, lead pencils, etc., which were found at the time and place\u00a0 where the\u00a0 defendants\u00a0 were gambling, had actually been used\u00a0 in connection with the prohibited game.\u00a0 The fiscal evidently presented them as evidence, simply for the purpose of corroborating the statements of the witnesses who swore positively that they\u00a0 had\u00a0 seen the defendants\u00a0 gambling.\u00a0 All of said exhibits might well\u00a0 be eliminated from the record without affecting the positive and direct proof presented at the trial, showing that the defendants had,\u00a0 beyond a reasonable do.ubt, been engaged in playing the prohibited game of monte.\u00a0 We are of the opinion that, even\u00a0 though it be admitted that said exhibits were inadmissible in evidence, the fact that they were\u00a0 admitted\u00a0 in no way prejudiced the defendants.<\/p><p>With reference to the second assignment of error, it will be noted by reference to section 13 of General\u00a0 Orders, No. 58, and section 2 of Act No. 194, that in\u00a0 every\u00a0 preliminary examination conducted by a justice of the peace,\u00a0 the declarations of the witnesses shall be reduced to writing and\u00a0 signed by the witnesses.\u00a0 Neither General Orders, No.\u00a0 58, nor\u00a0 said Act No.\u00a0 194 requires the justice of the peace, in any case, to forward these declarations to the Court of First Instance. Section 13 of Act No. 1627\u00a0 amends section 2 of\u00a0 Act No 194 and relieves\u00a0 the justice of the peace who conducts\u00a0 a\u00a0 preliminary examination from the necessity of taking down\u00a0 in writing the testimony of the witnesses, except the declaration of the accused himself.\u00a0\u00a0 Said section 13\u00a0 of Act\u00a0 No. 1627\u00a0 provides that in a criminal case appealed to the Court of First Instance, as well\u00a0 as\u00a0 in\u00a0 preliminary investigations where the accused is bound over to the Court of First Instance, the justice of the peace shall forward to the provincial fiscal a brief statement of the substance of the testimony. The purpose of requiring the justice of the peace to forward to the provincial fiscal\u00a0 a brief statement of the substance of the testimony, evidently is to enable the provincial fiscal to decide, in\u00a0 the first instance, whether he shall present a complaint against the defendant, and in the second, to\u00a0 enable him, in case he decides\u00a0 to prosecute,\u00a0 to properly formulate said complaint.\u00a0\u00a0 It is practically impossible, in the thickly populated provinces of\u00a0 the Philippine Islands, for the provincial fiscal\u00a0 to personally attend all\u00a0 of the trials and preliminary investigations held before the justices of the peace. The purpose of the provisions of said\u00a0 section 13\u00a0 is evidently to enable the provincial fiscal to have sufficient information to enable him to decide whether or not the defendant, in the trial before the justice of the peace or\u00a0 in a preliminary investigation, shall be further prosecuted\u00a0 in the Court of First Instance.<\/p><p>In the present case if the\u00a0 memoranda or brief statement of the substance of the testimony taken before the justice of the\u00a0 peace\u00a0 and later forwarded to the\u00a0 provincial fiscal contained any fact or\u00a0 information which the\u00a0 defendants desired to have presented to the Court of First Instance, the law\u00a0 afforded them a remedy by a\u00a0 <em>subpoena\u00a0 duces tecum<\/em>. (See sec. 402, Act No. 190.)\u00a0 We have decided in numerous cases that the\u00a0 record of a preliminary examination constitutes no part, necessarily, of the proceedings in the Court of First Instance; that\u00a0 it\u00a0 does not constitute a part of the record of the Court of First Instance, unless it\u00a0 is properly presented as evidence.\u00a0 The trial in the Court of First Instance is a trial de novo.\u00a0\u00a0 The record of the justice of the peace made in\u00a0 a preliminary investigation, can not be used as the basis of the sentence of the Court of First Instance. The only\u00a0 purpose of presenting the record of the\u00a0 preliminary examination in the Court of First Instance is\u00a0 perhaps for the purpose of testing the credibility of the\u00a0 witnesses. The\u00a0 record\u00a0 in\u00a0 the preliminary\u00a0 examination may\u00a0 be presented for the purpose\u00a0 of showing\u00a0 that certain witnesses testified to\u00a0 certain facts in the\u00a0 preliminary examination which were contrary to their declarations\u00a0 in\u00a0 the Court of First Instance.\u00a0\u00a0 (U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Capisonda, 1 PhiL Rep., 575.)<\/p><p>With reference to the 3d assignment of errors\u00a0 to wit: that the lower\u00a0 court imposed an excessive\u00a0 fine in imposing a fine of P300, it may be said that\u00a0 said fine is\u00a0 within the provisions of the law and in our opinion is not excessive. Section 3\u00a0 of said Act No. 1757\u00a0 provides that any person violating this section, shall be punished by a fine of\u00a0 not less than P10 nor more than P500, or by imprisonment for not more than one\u00a0 year, or by both such fine and imprisonment m the\u00a0 discretion\u00a0 of the court.\u00a0 We find no reason in\u00a0 the record for modifying the sentence of the lower court with reference to the fine imposed.<\/p><p>With reference to the 4th assignment of error, it will be noted that the appellants claim that the lower court committed an error in deciding that the defendants were guilty of playing the prohibited game\u00a0 of <em>monte<\/em>\u00a0 \"con apuestas de dinero.\"\u00a0 The appellant has evidently overlooked section 7 of Act No. 1757, which provides, among other things, that -\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"The playing at and conducting of any game of\u00a0 <em>monte<\/em> *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 is hereby prohibited, and any person taking any part therein\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 shall be punished as provided in section\u00a0 3 hereof.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>While it may be true, generally, that persons who play the game of monte play for money,\u00a0 yet, nevertheless, the use of money in the game is not a necessary element in the crime described or defined by the law.\u00a0 It seems that the purpose of the law was to prohibit absolutely the game of monte in the Philippine Islands.\u00a0\u00a0 The mere fact that money was or was not used in no way constitutes an element of the crime.<\/p><p>In our opinion the evidence shows, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the appellants did, on or about the 1st day of August, 1911, play, in the house of\u00a0 one Cayetano Rafael, at the prohibited\u00a0 game of monte,\u00a0 together with their co-defendants.<\/p><p>After a careful examination of the evidence contained in the record, and of the assignments\u00a0 of error, we\u00a0 find\u00a0 no reason for modifying the sentence of the lower court. The same is, therefore, hereby affirmed, with costs.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<\/p><p><em> Arellano, C. J., Mapa<\/em> and\u00a0 <em>Trent, JJ.<\/em>, concur.<\/p><\/div>",

In support of this allegation he presented as sole proof the testimony of a physician who stated that, by direction and request of the defendant, he made four visits at the house of the offended party for the purpose of examining and observing the latter, and that, although he always found him abed and complaining of pains in his chest, he had no external or internal injury and the pains of which he complained were merely feigned. This witness added that he made the first examination on the fourth or sixth day after the occurrence of the alleged crime, and the subsequent ones at intervals of two days each. On the contrary, the offended party testified that he was slapped and kicked by the accused, and received injuries upon different parts which produced the pains in his chest, and that as a result of which he spat blood and was bedridden for a period of ten days, during which time he was incapacitated for performing his customary labors. These facts were fully corroborated by the wife and a son of the offended party and in part by the president of the board of health of the pueblo, who was a medical practitioner and who examined the offended party on the day after the assault; this witness testified that the latter had a black and blue bruise in the breast and another in the jaw, and felt pains in his chest and had difficulty in breathing.<br\/><br\/>The defense maintains that the testimony of their witness, a physician, should prevail over that of a mere <i>cirujano ministrante<\/i> like the president of the municipal board of health who testified for the prosecution. Theoretically, it is true that a physician is presumed to possess greater scientific knowledge than a <i>cirujano ministrante<\/i>, and for this reason, in circumstances affecting the veracity and impartiality of each and his opportunity for observing the facts submitted to his expert examination, greater consideration should, as a general rule, be given to the opinion of the former than to that of the latter, in matters which come within their technical knowledge. But in the present case it is not a question of a strictly expert opinion, or of facts which require, for their proper and exact appreciation, technical of scientific knowledge. The fact with respect to which the testimony of the president of the board of health may be held to be worthy of consideration, consists in the existence, as asserted by him, of several <i>discolored contusions<\/i> on the person of the offended party, and it is evident that this is a fact which can be perceived and testified to by any person who has a clear sense of sight, without the necessity of his possessing any notion whatever of either medicine or surgery. In regard to this point there is no reason at all for claiming that greater credibility should be given to the statements of the witness for the defense. merely because he is a physician, especially as this witness did not examine the offended party until the fourth or sixth day after the occurrence of the alleged crime, while the president of the municipal board of health made his examination two days after the assault. It being a matter of superficial bruises of an unimportant nature, such as were certified to by the said president of the board of health, it would not be at all strange that they had completely disappeared before the physician made his first examination some days afterwards. What is certain is that the existence of the injuries was asserted at the trial, not only by the president of the municipal board of health, but also by the wife and a son of the offended party, all of whom fully corroborate the testimony given by the latter on this point.<br\/><br\/>The injuries having been proven, there remains to be determined the period of time required for their cure and disappearance. In the judgment appealed from it is held to have been proven that Permin Castillo, the complaining witness, was incapacitated from engaging in his customary labors for a period of ten days as a result of the said injuries, and certainly this conclusion of fact is sufficiently supported by the testimony of the offended party himself, of his wife and son, a3 hereinabove stated; the testimony on this point is conclusive. It is averred, in the brief presented by counsel for the defense, that this last witness testified in clear and categorical terms that his father's injuries were cured seven days after the assault. It would really seem that this witness did so state in his testimony, but, upon a perusal of that testimony in its entirety it clearly appears that the witness referred to the external injuries, that is, to the contusions certified to by the president of the municipal board of health, and not to the effects produced by such injuries and by the blows received by the offended party on his chest, inasmuch as this very witness in his same testimony asserted that his father was spitting blood every day for a period of ten consecutive days. The bruises might very well have disappeared after a lapse of seven days or sooner, and yet he still might have continued to spit blood and suffer from pains in his chest, both caused by the blows which prevented him from working, 3ince he was unable to make any exertion without spitting blood, as this witness affirmed in his testimony. Contusions are not necessary indications of such pains and the spitting of blood, both of which may exist without the former.<br\/><br\/>In contrast to the evidence of the prosecution relative to this feature, there is the physician's testimony presented by the defense, reference to which has been made above. This witness, in testifying that he did not observe any internal injury on the person of the victim, although he carefully examined him two or three times, tends to prove that there were no pains in the chest and no spitting of blood, as related by the witnesses for the prosecution. But in weighing the evidence the trial judge found the testimony of these latter more worthy of credibility than that of the said witness for the defense, and indeed we see no reason for not holding his opinion to be correct. The question of the greater or less credibility of the witnesses, is one for consideration by the judge of the Court of First Instance who has personal opportunity to observe their behavior and manner of testifying; for which reason his opinion in this matter must be upheld, unless it be shown that it is manifestly erroneous, which has not been done in the present case.<br\/><br\/>The defense alleges that there is no proof in the record with regard to the amount of the damage suffered by the offended party and that, consequently, the fine of twenty pesos imposed upon the defendant, as an indemnity for such injuries, is entirely unjustifiable and therefore illegal. It is true that no direct and positive proof was presented. It was shown, however, that the offended party is by Occupation a laborer and that he was incapacitated from working for a period of ten days. That incapacity for work constitutes a real and actual damage to him and consequently the fact of the damage suffered by the herein defendant on account of such incapacity is unquestionable. Upon this premise, we believe that, in the absence of proof, the judge could legally exercise a prudent and sound discretion for the determination of the amount of the damages. The law leaves much to the power and discretion of the courts, as may be readily seen from the provisions of the statutes. The Penal Code, after prescribing, in article 119, that civil liability springing from crimes comprises first, restitution, second, reparation of the damage caused, and third, indemnification for consequential damages, provides as follows:<br\/><br\/>\"Art. 122. Indemnification for losses shall include not only those caused the injured party, but also those suffered by his family or by a third person by reason of the crime.<br\/><blockquote> \"The courts <i>shall determine<\/i> the amount of this indemnification in the manner prescribed for the reparation of damages in the next preceding article.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The preceding article reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"Art. 121. <i>The court shall determine<\/i> the amount of damage, taking into consideration the price of the thing whenever possible, and its special value to the injured party, and reparation shall be made accordingly.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Words of practically the same meaning as <i>the court shall determine<\/i> are also used in article 120, which is of the following tenor:<br\/><blockquote> \"The restitution of the thing itself must be made whenever possible, with allowance for any deterioration or diminution of value, <i>as determined by the court<\/i>.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>This last phrase clearly shows that the determination of the amount of the deterioration or of the diminution of value, as well as of the damages and losses, in the respective cases, has been commended by the law entirely to the discretion of the courts. By this, we do not wish to say that proofs are unnecessary and useless; on the contrary, they should, whenever possible, be produced to enlighten the discernment of the judge. The meaning we wish to convey is merely that, with proofs or without them, the determination of the question always depends finally upon judicial discretion. So true and patent is this that sometimes it is not even possible to present concrete and positive proof, as, for example, when it is a question of the special value mentioned in the aforecited article 121. The impossibility of establishing, in many cases, precise and exact bases for indemnification is doubtless the reason taken into account by the law, according to the express language of the statute, for submitting the same to the determination of the courts.<br\/><br\/>\"This determination is in some cases materially easy to be made,\" says Pacheco in his work, commenting on the said provisions of the Penal Code, \"as, for example, in the matter of expenses for medical attendance and for wages lost. In nearly all other matters, there necessarily must be arbitrary appraisal, in the calculation of which consideration must be had, not only of what is just, but also of what is suitable and possible. When it is a question of a rich criminal, it goes without saying that the courts have greater amplitude for the exercise of discretionary power than in the case of a culprit who is poor. * * * Therefore the law must rely so much on judicial discretion, for there can be no hard and fast rules in this matter such that they will not be subject to the influence of circumstances * * *. To the prudence and to the discretion of the courts,\" he adds, \"much must necessarily be left in order that such liabilities may be adequate.\"<br\/><br\/>It is but the application of this principle which justifies the constant practice in the decisions of this court of sentencing those convicted of the crimes of homicide or murder to pay a fixed sum as indemnity, without necessarily requiring any concrete proof of the exact amount of the damage. In such cases this court simply avails itself of the power conferred upon it by law to determine, in its discretion, the amount of the damage, pursuant to the provisions above quoted.<br\/><br\/>In the present case, it has not been shown that the trial judge abused his discretionary power in fixing the amount of the damages suffered by the offended party at twenty pesos; indeed, we do not consider the said sum to be excessive, in view of the fact that the person injured was a laborer who was prevented from engaging in his work for a period of ten days, taking into account, at the same time, the position of the defendant, who, as clearly shown by the record, was a rich man.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with the addition that, in default of the payment of the indemnity of twenty pesos imposed upon the defendant, the latter shall suffer the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment at the rate of one day for each twelve and a half pesetas that remain unpaid. The costs of this instance are assessed against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

TEOFILO OSORIO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">Appeal by Teofilo Osorio from a judgment rendered by the Honorable Adolph Wislizenus.<br\/><br\/>On February 14, 1910, in the town of Dalaguete, Cebu, Teofilo Osorio, clerk of the Cebu police force, entered into a scheme with Mateo Navarro, municipal policeman of Cebu, and Bartolome Dicdiquin, municipal policeman of Dalaguete, for the purpose of getting money by intimidation from a Chinaman, Yap Buyco or Yap Buya. To do this, the defendant arranged that his younger brother, Simplicio Osorio, should put a can, with some opium in it, in the said Chinaman's store.\u00a0 After this had been done, Teofilo Osorio at once repaired to said store with the two policemen, Navarro and Dicdiquin, pretending that he was the chief of police. Navarro was at the time carrying a revolver.\u00a0 They proceeded immediately to search said store, without being provided with the necessary search warrant or warrant of arrest. After having moved and examined various articles and boxes in said store, they found the can of opium, previously placed therein, and Teofilo Osorio, aided by Navarro, began to intimidate the Chinaman who owned the store by telling him that he would be arrested, charged with illegal possession of opium and taken to jail, unless he produced the sum of P1,000. But later, through the mediation or intercession of other Chinamen, friends of Yap Buyco, Osorio finally consented to reduce the sum demanded to P300, and it was forthwith paid by the Chinaman to the sham officers, Osorio and Navarro. Osorio then told Yap Buyco not to worry about the opium found in his store, because he himself would be responsible, and they went away. Osorio kept the P300, merely giving P10 to the other policeman, Bartolome Dicdiquin, who had stood guard at the door of the store during the search.<br\/><br\/>An information was accordingly filed by the provincial fiscal against Teofilo Osorio and Mateo Navarro, charging them with the crime of robbery; but later, at the fiscal's request, the court dismissed the case against Mateo Navarro and tried only the case against Teofilo Osorio. Judgment therein was rendered on September 2, 1910, sentencing the defendant to the penalty of three years, eight months and one day of <i>prision correccional<\/i>, with costs. From this judgment the defendant appealed.<br\/><br\/>The facts stated, and duly proven in this case, point to the crime of robbery, committed by means of intimidation of the person of the Chinaman Yap Buyco, which is provided for and punished by articles 502 and 503, No. 5, of the Penal Code; for by threatening the person of the injured party the thief succeeded in securing the sum of P300, delivered through the former's fear that if he did not do so, he would be arrested and turned over to tho courts as a smuggler and possessor of opium, which the defendant claimed to have found in his store.<br\/><br\/>The crime prosecuted is not <i>estafa<\/i>, but, as has been said, robbery with intimidation of the person of the injured party. The facts are analogous to those which led to a case wherein judgment was rendered on appeal, dated June 24, 1875, as follows: An individual presented himself in the houses of various residents and demanded money on the pretext that it was for a gang of outlaws in the neighboring hills, for which he had been commissioned by the gang; and he accordingly received various sums of money from those people. The supreme court of Spain declared that the facts related constitute the crime of robbery with intimidation of the persons, and stated that: The essential element in the crime of <i>estafa<\/i> is the artful cunning employed by a person who is endeavoring thereby to deceive his intended victim, and accordingly such astuteness or cunning excludes all idea of intimidation, violence or other means of like nature which restricts or hinders the exercise of the will, as it remains free and independent, however it may be unsettled and confused by suggestions, circumstances which also concur in the frauds provided for by the Penal Code.<br\/><br\/>\"The defendant, in demanding the sums he succeeded in securing from different parties, whether or not the existence of such a gang was a fact, accomplished his purpose by means of threats of the injury the outlaws might cause the persons to whom he applied if they did not contribute what he asked.\"<br\/><br\/>Intimidation was present, and the acts he performed can not legally be held to constitute <i>estafa<\/i> or fraud.<br\/><br\/>In another judgment, November 3, 1882, the same supreme court held that: According to article 515 of the Penal Code of Spain, identical with 502 for the Philippines, robbery is committed by persons who, for the sake of gain, take possession of the personal property of others with violence or intimidation of the persons. Intimidation, which characterizes as robbery the seizure of the personal property of another, is present whenever to obtain the same acts are performed which, either in their own nature or by reason of the circumstances under which they are executed, inspire fear in the persons against whom they are directed.<br\/><br\/>The Chinaman Yap Buyco or Yap Buya was startled by the finding of a quantity of opium in his store, when he knew that he did not have any such article therein, and it is natural that he was overcome with fright, foreseeing that as a prisoner charged with smuggling he would, after the trouble incident to a trial of greater or less length, incur the personal and pecuniary penalties provided by law. So it is not strange that he was seized with dread that he would be tried, sent to prison, ruined in his business and finally punished as a smuggler, in spite of the fact that the opium found by the individuals, who appeared in his store and searched it with the character and appearance of officers of the law, was not his; and so he felt obliged to accede to their demands by delivering to them the sum which would induce them to agree that he should not be arrested and that the mock arrest for possession of opium be not reported to the proper authorities. The Chinaman was therefore placed in the same position as the persons who had to give money through fear of the injury that might be done them by outlaws, in whose name the demand for the money was made.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the influence exerted upon and the intense fear produced in the mind of the victim, no great distinction can be made between the procedure of sham officers of the law and outlaws who commit a robbery; the latter jeopardize life by their attempt, while the former by their acts deprive the injured parties of their property and commit the crime through the respect inspired by the belief that they represent the law.<br\/><br\/>Neither can the crime in question be characterized as threats, because such crime depends upon the moral pressure which threat of future injury exerts upon a person to obtain, at some future time, the end sought. When the crime consists in materially taking possession of or securing, on the spot, the delivery of the money or other personal property, through the effect of fear or fright which imminence of the injury threatened produces in the mind of the person intimidated, the nature of the penal act is altered and constitutes, not threats but the crime of robbery with intimidation defined by article 515 of the Penal Code of Spain, identical with 502 for the Philippines; and the facts should be so characterized. Such is the principle established by the supreme court of Spain in a judgment of June 16, 1900.<br\/><br\/>Robbery then is unquestionably the proper classification for the crime\u00a0 committed against said Chinaman, from whom sham officers of the law succeeded in securing the sum of P300, under pressure and menace of arrest, indictment and trial for violation of the opium law, for such procedure constitutes intimidation.<br\/><br\/>In spite of the defendant's denial and his plea of not guilty, the case affords decisive and conclusive evidence of his guilt as principal, and he is fully convicted of the crime of robbery under consideration. He was unable to refute such conclusive and satisfactory evidence as appears in the case, and his statements in his own defense are absolutely groundless. He confesses to have gone with others into the injured party's store in order to make a search for opium. Although he imputes the whole operation to Mateo Navarro, with the admission that they all pretended that they were policemen, yet none of them was authorized to make a search of said store, and he took the part of leader in performing the penal act.\u00a0 Mateo Navarro avers that upon going with another person to said store the defendant Osorio represented himself to be the chief of police; that it was Osorio who took charge of the P300 delivered by the Chinaman and that he gave P10 to the policeman of Dalaguete, Bartolome Dicdiquin, who had stood guard at the door of the store during the search, and adds that, after committing the deed, Osorio told him in the road that he would give him a part of said sum in Cebu, as it was dangerous to do so in that town, and that he also had to give another share to his brother Simplicio. From all this it appears that the principal part which the defendant Osorio took in the crime of robbery at bar is beyond all doubt.<br\/><br\/>The presence of the aggravating circumstance, that the crime was committed in the dwelling of the injured party, must be admitted, without any mitigating circumstance to counteract its effect, and the penalty prescribed by No. 5 of article 503 of the Penal Code must be imposed in its maximum degree.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, whereby the errors assigned are refuted, it is our opinion that the judgment should be modified so as to sentence and we hereby sentence Teofilo Osorio to the penalty of seven years of presidio mayor, with the accessories prescribed by article 57 of the code, to restitution of the sum of P300 to the injured Chinaman, Yap Buyco or Yap Buya, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, owing to the nature of the penalty, and to the costs in both instances.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Duffy, 117 Wis.,\u00a0 480.)<\/p><p>In\u00a0 order to justify the allowance of\u00a0 extra compensation in accordance the provisions of section 680, supra, the estate must have been large, the settlement attended with great difficulty, and\u00a0 a high degree of capacity required on the part of the administrator.\u00a0\u00a0 All three of these requirements must\u00a0 have been\u00a0 present.\u00a0 If the administrator\u00a0 is required to use only ordinary business ability, the case does not fall within the rule.\u00a0\u00a0 It of\u00a0 executors and administrators to use their best\u00a0 efforts to discover collect outstanding claims and unless some peculiar circumstances or\u00a0 co render their discovery and collection unusually difficult and require a degree of capacity, the compensation provided of\u00a0 P4 per\u00a0 day for the time employed and the commissions\u00a0 on the\u00a0 amounts disbursed, together with actual expenses, must be considered sufficient remuneration.<\/p><p>One thousand\u00a0 pesos was allowed the administrator for the prosecution of an action for the recovery of money supposed to be due the estate. Wit reference to this item the administrator says that that suit\u00a0 \"was\u00a0 brought and prosecuted\u00a0 to a\u00a0 conclusion in\u00a0 the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands, but was unsuccessful.\u00a0 The total expense of maintaining said suit amounted to the sum of Pl,172.30.\" The court said that the\u00a0 P1,000 was allowed\u00a0 the administrator for the prosecution of that suit,\u00a0 while the administrator says that\u00a0 that amount was a part of the expense. If this Pl,000 was actually paid\u00a0 out of the funds of the estate by the administrator as\u00a0 a\u00a0 part of the expenses of that\u00a0 suit, the\u00a0 administrator would no doubt have\u00a0 been authorized to charge that amount in his final account, as the court\u00a0 authorized\u00a0 the bringing of the suit. On examine the administrator's\u00a0 accounts we find\u00a0 that there was paid the clerk of court\u00a0 and the sheriff P22.36; costs paid the clerk of the Supreme\u00a0 Court P58; the translator P50; another\u00a0 item of costs paid the clerk of the co P41.94; making\u00a0 a total of\u00a0 Pl72.30.\u00a0\u00a0 According: to\u00a0 the account, no o expenses were paid\u00a0 on account of this suit, and in view\u00a0 of the fact that the\u00a0 court says the Pl,006 was allowed\u00a0 the administrator, we\u00a0 must conclude\u00a0 that this amount was allowed him for\u00a0 the work performed by him in connection with this suit.\u00a0 There is nothing in the record to show services were rendered by the administrator for which he was allowed the Pl,000, except, it is stated, that he was allowed this amount in connect with the prosecution of that\u00a0 suit. If this amount were allowed for the actually employed by him in the prosecution of that suit, that time has already been paid for by the per diem allowance.\u00a0 If\u00a0 it were\u00a0 allowed a an\u00a0 attorney's fee (and the administrator in this case\u00a0 is an attorney a law) this was\u00a0 in conflict\u00a0 with the express provision of\u00a0 section 680, which prohibits such an allowance.\u00a0 When the services of a\u00a0 lawyer are necessary in the settlement of an estate, it is to the\u00a0 interest of the that the\u00a0 administrator secure the best talent possible on the most favorable terms. If he be an attorney\u00a0 and allowed to undertake such services, it his own interest\u00a0 to perform the services himself and to secure an allow for his fees.\u00a0 This, in effect, allows the administrator to make contract himself, and violates the familiar principle that one acting in a fiduciary capacity\u00a0 must not place himself in such a position that his own\u00a0 interest become antagonistic with those of his principal.\u00a0 If the only service performed by the administrator was\u00a0 the\u00a0 employment of counsel for\u00a0 the purposes of the suit,\u00a0 such a service cannot be considered as above the ability of an ordinary\u00a0 business man.\u00a0\u00a0 This\u00a0 item, in\u00a0 either case, mus disallowed.<\/p><p>As to the sale of the\u00a0 oil store, the administrator states;\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"A great deal of trouble was taken and time consumed by your administrator in investigating this matter.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Again he says: -\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p> \"That in addition to the services above mentioned your administrator performed\u00a0 special and\u00a0 difficult\u00a0 services\u00a0 in realizing u interest which the\u00a0 deceased had in\u00a0 an oil store conducted by one\u00a0 Uy To Qua on Calle Jaboneros. That there was nothing in the inventory made by previous administrators regarding\u00a0 this oil store and no information regarding it\u00a0 was furnished your\u00a0 administrator\u00a0 by any parties\u00a0 interested.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>It is\u00a0 difficult\u00a0 to determine, in fact it\u00a0 is\u00a0 impossible\u00a0 to point out, two claims the\u00a0 court\u00a0 had in mind when it allowed the administrator P250 for their settlement. Neither does\u00a0 the\u00a0 administrator nor the\u00a0 court state just what two claims were under consideration.\u00a0\u00a0 The only information\u00a0 before upon this point is the statement of the court that it was aware that unusual services had been performed\u00a0 in connection with the settlement\u00a0 of two cl of the estate.\u00a0\u00a0 The court does not specifically state that the P500 allowed the administrator for his work\u00a0 in connection with the oil store and the allowed for his services\u00a0 in connection\u00a0 with the settlement of the two c were additional compensation over and above the per diem allowance. But taking into consideration the\u00a0 fact that\u00a0 the administrator\u00a0 was allowed the first\u00a0 eleven\u00a0 months\u00a0 P4 for every day during that time (exclusive o Sundays and holidays) and\u00a0 for the next twenty-five months was. allowed P per\u00a0 day for one-half\u00a0 of that time' (exclusive of Sundays and holidays), logical conclusion\u00a0 is that the items of P500 and P250 were additional allowances; or, in other words,\u00a0 the\u00a0 administrator was\u00a0 allowed P4\u00a0 per for every day\u00a0 he was engaged\u00a0 in\u00a0 investigating the\u00a0 interest that\u00a0 the estate had in the oil store and in the settlement of the two\u00a0 claims, and the extra amounts of P500 and\u00a0 P250.\u00a0\u00a0 There is nothing in the record to show that a high\u00a0 degree of capacity was required in the settlement of the two matters.\u00a0 On the contrary,\u00a0 it appears from an examination of the affairs of the whole estate as shown in the administrator's report, that estate was\u00a0 one\u00a0 of the ordinary kind.\u00a0 The administrator carried on no business\u00a0 for\u00a0 the estate which\u00a0 required\u00a0 skill or\u00a0 capacity to meet competition.\u00a0\u00a0 In fact\u00a0 he carried on no\u00a0 business at all except to dispose the property belonging to the estate. We think it\u00a0 is clear that the court erred in allowing these two items.<\/p><p>For\u00a0 the foregoing reasons,\u00a0 the order appealed from is modified by disallowing\u00a0 the administrator the P1,000 for his services in connection prosecution of the civil suit; the additional amounts of P500, allowed for services in connection with the oil store; and of P250,\u00a0 allowed in connect with the settlement of the two claims.\u00a0 In all other respects, the order affirmed without costs.<\/p><p><em>Arellano, C.

The trial court found that the plaintiff and her minor brothers and sisters  (whom she represents) are the owners pro indiviso of this plantation, and entitled to the possession of the same, together  with a reasonable amount, which was fixed at P100, for its use and occupation.<\/p>\n<p>There is no question about the  location and description of the land in dispute.  Both parties claim to have derived their title from the same person, Agata Botocave.   The plaintiffs claim that this land was  purchased from the said Agata Botocave on January 15,  1895, by  their deceased father.  The  defendant, Marciana Dirilo, claims that she bought this property from the same person in the year 1894. The plaintiffs presented a  private document  evidencing the purchase made by their father.  The defendant Marciana presented no document of  her alleged purchase, but claims that her contract was  a verbal one only.   The private  document is attacked  by  the  defendants as false in that the signature of Felis Dirilo, one of the subscribing witnesses, is not genuine.  In support of this  proposition, one Stevers was called as a handwriting expert and  testified that he had been district auditor in the Government service since April 1,  1908; that during that time it had been necessary for him  at various times to identify signatures on  money orders and registered mails; that he  had not made  any special study of the science of chirography;  and that he is not skilled in this art.   He testified to certain peculiarities in the signatures to the document presented by the plaintiffs as compared with the body of the document, and especially with regard to the signature of Felis Dirilo, and stated tjiat in his opinion the signature of Felis Dirilo was signed by the same person who wrote the body of the  document.  It is admitted that the document is not in the handwriting of Felis  Dirilo, but it does not follow that the signature of the said Felis  Dirilo is a forgery.  Apparently, Mr. Stevers did not note that the first  name of Dirilo  is spelled in the body of the document F-e-l-i-x, while in the signature it is spelled F-e-l-i-s.  It is hardly  probable that if the  same person wrote the document and signed  this name thereto he would have made this mistake in the spelling of \"Felis.\" And furthermore, the  sons of the  vendor, who signed the document at the time  it was executed,  testified positively that the said document was executed in due form and 'that all  the signatures thereto  are  genuine.<\/p>\n<p>Mr. Stevers did not qualify as a handwriting expert.  He admitted that he had made no special study as such and that he was not skilled in this  art.  In order to render one a competent  witness as an expert to the genuineness of a signature, he must have been educated in the business about which he testifies or he must have acquired actual skill and knowledge  of the subject.   It  is not enough that  he has sometimes compared signatures of other persons when disagreements as to their genuineness had arisen in the course of business.  (Goldstein <em>vs.<\/em> Black et al., 50 Cal., 462; Heacock <em>vs.<\/em> State, 13 Tex. Court of App., 97; State <em>vs.<\/em> Tompkins, 71 Mo., 618.)<\/p>\n<p>Jose Dirilo, father of the  plaintiffs, purchased the  land in question in 1895 and immediately entered into the possession. He  remained in possession  until the year 1902, when  he mortgaged this land to one Pablo Roses and left Pagbilao, where the land is located,  and never returned.  About 1909, sometimes after the death of Jose\"  Dirilo, his children, the plaintiffs, returned to Pagbilao and found the defendants in possession of the land.  They immediately demanded the return of this land, but the defendants  refused to comply with this demand.  Pablo Roses had had possession of the land about a year when he mortgaged it  to one Jose  Dirilo, a cousin of the deceased father of the plaintiffs.   This Jose Dirilo remained in possession until about 1905,  when the defendant Marciana Dirilo,  who is a sister of the deceased father of the plaintiffs, claimed that this land belonged to the undivided estate of their (Marciana  and Jose Dirilo's) parents, and upon this claim secured possession of the same; but on the trial of this case in the court below she claimed to have purchased this property, as we have said, from Agata Botocave.   The defendants well knew that this  land belonged to  the heirs  of the deceased Jose Dirilo and  that they had no  interest whatever in said land.  They also knew that the products from this  small hacienda had long  before 1909 fully paid the amount for which  it was originally mortgaged.   So it cannot be said that they have been possessors in good faith since demand was made upon them for the return of the land.   They must, therefore, account for the products since that year.  The amount fixed by the court at P100 is fully supported by the evidence.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment appealed from is therefore affirmed in all of its parts,  with costs against the appellants.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

The accused was sentenced to twenty-five days of <i>arresto<\/i> in the municipal jail, but, instead of serving his sentence therein, he passed the time in the house of the municipal president. The said president disregarded the protest made to him by So Priengco, who objected to the said Agapito Lasada serving his sentence in this manner, so the Chinaman endeavored to bring his case before the provincial officials.<br\/><br\/>At a late hour of the evening of March 80, 1908, as Espiridion Moldes was emerging from a wood in the barrio of Tarragona, pueblo of Abuyog, Leyte, at a point near the Balocaue River, for the purpose of gathering coconuts, he met one Benito Resardo who was there cutting bamboo. After conversing a while, the two agreed to return together to the inhabited portion of the barrio, which they did. Upon reaching the Cantaguigui Creek they stopped to wash their feet, whereupon Pedro So Priengco came up, exchanged a few words with them and, without stopping, continued on his way across the creek. After a little while, they too went on and crossed the said Balocaue River by a footbridge, and upon reaching the opposite bank they heard a noise as if blows were being struck upon a human body and, immediately thereafter, the screams of a Chinaman: \"Don't kill me.\" Moldes and Resardo thereupon immediately hid among some cogon grass near-by and from their hiding place saw, at a distance of about 12 feet from them, Agapito Lasada holding the Chinaman, Pedro So Priengco, by the hair which he had wrapped around his hands. Santiago Lasada and Macario Lasada were striking the said Chinaman with their sticks, and soon afterwards Pannlo Closa struck him in the side with a cutting weapon. At this moment the Chinaman was stretched face-down on the ground and Agapito from time to time jerked the Chinaman's hair, saying: \"Now you won't complain again, you quarrelsome Chinaman.\" Thereafter the witnesses heard Macario Lasada tell Santiago and Panfilo to make sure that nobody was in the neighborhood so that they might kill the Chinaman and thus prevent his denouncing the crime they had committed. Thereupon the witnesses became afraid and concealed themselves in a dense part of the wood until nightfall, when they came out on to the trail and continued their journey. Both agreed not to mention the occurrence, for fear of the vengeance of the accused, although five days afterwards Moldes, being affected by the tears of the deceased's daughter Julia, related to her what he had seen.<br\/><br\/>A short while after the commission of the crime, at nighttime, and not far from the place where it occurred, Lope Margate, who was traveling along the highway in the direction of the barrio of Tarragona, saw four persons at a distance of about 15 feet ahead of him. Among them he recognized Agapito Lasada, Santiago Lasada, and Panfilo Closa, and he heard Santiago Lasada say to one of his companions: \"Where did you put the bolo?\" to which the person questioned replied: \"I put the point of the blade into the ground and made the hand grasp the hilt of the bolo.\" After this, the four men, one of whom was not recognized by the witness, went on and entered a house.<br\/><br\/>By reason of the foregoing facts, the provincial fiscal, on December 9, 1908, filed a complaint with the Court of First Instance of Leyte, charging Agapito Lasada, Santiago Lasada, and Panfilo Closa with the crime of murder. Agapito Lasada was tried separately and was sentenced by final judgment to the penalty of seventeen years four months and one day of <i>reclusion temporal<\/i>, to the accessory penalties, to indemnify the family of the deceased in the sum of P1,000, and to the payment of one-fourth of the costs, which judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court.<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> Panfilo Closa escaped, and therefore this case was only prosecuted against Macario Lasada and Santiago Lasada. As a result of the trial, the court rendered judgment on January 6th of this year, sentencing each of them to the penalty of seventeen years four months and one day of <i>reclusion temporal<\/i>, to the accessory penalties, to the joint payment of an indemnity of P1,000 to the heirs of the deceased, and to pay one-half of the costs of the trial. From this judgment the defendants appealed.<br\/><br\/>The evidence fully proves that at dusk on March 30, 1908, while the Chinaman, Pedro So Priengco, was traveling along an old road or trail from the Balocaue River toward the barrio of Tarragona, in the pueblo of Abuyog, Leyte, he was met by the brothers Agapito, Santiago, and Macario Lasada, and one Panfilo Closa, the first three of whom were provided with clubs or sticks, and the latter with a bolo or knife, and that he was immediately assaulted by these four men who inflicted upon him several severe bruises or injuries in different parts of his body, especially on his forehead, and a wound in his right side. The Chinaman's forehead was crushed in by a heavy blow and the <i>curandero<\/i> or <i>mediquillo<\/i> who made a post-mortem examination of the body of the deceased on the day following the assault, stated that the injured man had died from the effects of this injury on his forehead and not from the wound inflicted in his right side, so that the violent death of the Chinaman, So Priengco, not partaking of the nature of the crime of murder, only constitutes that of homicide, provided for and punished by article 404 of the Penal Code, inasmuch as none of the qualifying circumstances, which require the imposition of the severer penalty prescribed in article 403, were present.<br\/><br\/>The two eyewitnesses, Espiridion Moldes and Benito Resardo, attracted from the bank of the Balocaue River by the cries of the victim and the sound of the blows inflicted upon him by his assailants, approached the scene of the occurrence. While hidden in the tall brush on the side of the said trail, at a distance of about 4 <i>brazas<\/i>, they saw the last blows struck, and also saw Panfilo Closa strike the victim in the right side with a knife or bolo while he lay stretched upon the ground; but they were unable to see how the assault commenced, for, as we have said, they approached only when they heard the cries of the deceased and the sound of the blows; and although one of the assailants caught the Chinaman by the hair while he lay upon the ground, and from time to time, by pulling his hair, jerked up the victim's head, saying: \"Now you won't complain again, you quarrelsome Chinaman,\" and notwithstanding that the assailants were four in number, it was not shown, even with all these details, that the crime was committed with <i>alevosia<\/i>, as there is no proof that the deed was perpetrated with treachery by the guilty parties employing ways and means which might have directly and particularly insured the consummation of the crime without any risk to themselves such as could have arisen from any defense that the victim might have offered; but there was attendant the aggravating circumstance of superiority, derived from the number of the assailants and the simultaneousness of the attack, and while this circumstance of course increases the responsibility contracted and requires the imposition of a severer penalty, it does not raise the crime to murder.<br\/><br\/>Neither would it be proper to hold that the circumstance of premeditation attended the killing of So Priengco, for it was not proved at the trial that his assailants had planned the crime after due reflection and with the deliberate intention of carrying it into effect in the manner in which they did. It is unquestionable that all the accused, by common accord, took part in the perpetration of the crime and cooperated therein with unity of purpose and criminal intention, but this circumstance does not constitute that premeditation which is manifested by ostensible and preparatory acts and which qualifies the crime of murder, because their determination or resolution, made upon mature reflection prior to the commission of the crime, was not manifested by outward acts; consequently, for the reasons just stated, the criminal act in question only constitutes the crime of homicide.<br\/><br\/>The two defendants, Macario and Santiago Lasada, pleaded not guilty, but notwithstanding their denial and exculpatory allegations, which were not duly substantiated at the trial, the record furnishes decisive and conclusive proof of their guilt as coprincipals with others, by direct participation, and they are fully convicted of the crime under prosecution, for, taking into consideration the value and weight of the testimony of the two eyewitnesses to the crime, corroborated as it is by that of the witness Lope Margate, the guilt of the said accused, jointly with the others before mentioned, is completely established.<br\/><br\/>The witness Lope Margate testified that he saw the defendants, Agapito and Santiago Lasada, Panfilo Closa, and another person, unknown to him, who must have been Macario Lasada, at about 8 o'clock on the evening of the crime, some hours after its commission; that said persons were gathered together and engaged in conversation on one side of the road, not far from the scene of the assault; that he heard Santiago Lasada ask one of his companions where he had put the bolo (evidently the one used by Closa in wounding the Chinaman in the right side); that the person interrogated, who must have been the said Closa, replied that he had stuck the blade of the bolo into the ground and caused the hand to appear to be holding the hilt of the weapon. This detail was corroborated on the finding of the body among some young coconut trees, for the right hand was apparently holding a bolo, the blade of which was stuck in the ground. This was testified to by Julia So Priengco, a daughter of the deceased, who said that she saw the weapon in that position when she went with the local authorities to the place where the body was found. The answer given by the above-mentioned accused undoubtedly refers to the body of the Chinaman which his slayers had left lying among the coconut trees; and it is unquestionable that the conversation overheard by Lope Margate, on his approaching them on the road in the evening of March 30, a short while after the crime, referred to the death of the deceased Chinaman. This witness added that when the four men started to go away he noticed that their trousers made a noise as if they were wet, and that, on his arrival at Santiago's house, he saw by the light inside that their trousers were actually wet.<br\/><br\/>It seems strange that, some hours after the murder, as Lope Margate followed the road traveled.by the Chinaman and on which he was killed, this witness did not see So Priengco's body in the middle of the trail, when at a short distance from the place he found the victim's four assailants assembled and engaged in conversation. But the disappearance of the Chinaman's body from the place where he was assaulted and killed is explained elsewhere in the record by the testimony of the daughter of the deceased, Julia, from which it is concluded that the perpetrators of the crime dragged the corpse to the other side of the Sisibaran <i>estero<\/i>, a tributary of the Balocaue River. This witness testified that her father was not killed at the place where his body was found, because the corpse, even to the hair of the head, was completely wet; that the shirt and trousers worn by the deceased were covered with mud, and that in the place where it was found by the authorities no blood was seen on the ground, while many blood stains and several human footprints were found on the bank of the said <i>estero<\/i>. It is therefore to be presumed that the body was removed from the trail where the assault Occurred to the place among the coconut trees where it was found, by dragging it across the aforementioned Sisibaran <i>estero<\/i>, and this explains why the trousers of the four men seen by Margate that night were wet.<br\/><br\/>After due consideration of the evidence adduced by the defense, together with the errors assigned to the judgment appealed from, the record is found to disclose no reasonable and just grounds for finding that the trial judge decided the case unjustly and without due regard for the evidence, or that he erred in finding that the material facts constituted the crime of homicide or, that the defendants Santiago and Macario Lasada, were two of the four men who assaulted and killed the Chinaman, So Priengco; or that the evidence introduced by the defense did not outweigh that adduced by the prosecution with respect to the defendants' guilt.<br\/><br\/>In fact, the divergent, when not contradictory and indefinite, testimony of the witnesses for the defense was unable positively to establish the alibi set up by the defendants, for the record shows it to have been fully proven that they were present with two other men, and participated in the crime.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding the exertions of the defense to prove that the two eyewitnesses to the crime could not have been present at the place of its perpetration, for the reason that they were elsewhere at the time, and that the said two witnesses, as also the third who heard the conversation of the criminals near the place where the Chinaman was assaulted, were adroitly coached, prepared with instructions and paid P200, yet the testimony of several others, offered in an attempt to prove these allegations, failed to establish the same or to invalidate the proofs that support the charge, reenforced as they are by the circumstantial evidence that corroborates the testimony offered by the prosecution. Such was the opinion of the trial judge, who held that the alleged facts related by certain witnesses of the defense were unreasonable and incredible, and no legal or just reason has been presented that would warrant a conclusion other than that arrived at in the judgment appealed from.<br\/><br\/>The circumstantial evidence derived from the perfectly proven facts that the body of the deceased, including the hair of his head, was found entirely wet, and the clothes he wore were covered with mud, is conclusive and indisputable. These details coincide with the circumstance that the trousers which were worn by the defendants and their two companions on the evening of the crime when Lope Margate met them on the road were wet, that the right hand of the dead man was apparently holding the hilt of the bolo, the blade of which was stuck in the ground\u2014a detail related by the said Margate\u2014and that at the place where the body was discovered no drops nor stains of blood were found, but that such traces were found on the bank of the Sisibiran <i>estero<\/i>, a branch of the Balocaue River, where, besides drops of blood, several human footprints were observed. From these circumstances it is concluded that the Chinaman was killed near the Balocaue River and on the trail leading to the barrio of Tarragona, and that his body was afterwards removed therefrom by being dragged across to and above the opposite bank of the Sisibaran <i>estero<\/i>, where it was afterwards found.<br\/><br\/>These details and circumstantial data and the fact that upon the discovery of the body it presented various contusions, one of them upon the forehead, which was crushed in by the blow, and a wound in the right side, corroborate the truth of the facts seen and related by the witnesses for the prosecution and prove the veracity of their testimony while at the same time they completely destroy the evidence of the defense, which was unsuccessful in shaking that of the prosecution.<br\/><br\/>From a careful study of this case, we infer that the sole determining motive of the crime was the revenge which the Lasada brothers, aided by Closa, and actuated by hatred and resentment, wreaked upon the Chinaman, So Priengco. The said brothers, especially Agapito Lasada, were at enmity with the Chinaman, the latter because he was sentenced to twenty-five days' imprisonment as the result of a quarrel which he and his brother Santiago had had with the said Chinaman, and in which the latter was wounded. As the aggrieved party saw that the prisoner was not serving his sentence in the municipal jail, but was living in the house of the <i>presidente<\/i>, he complained to the latter about it, but as this official paid no attention to him, he resolved to appeal to the provincial authorities and was endeavoring to have the matter brought up before them on one of the days following the 30th of March, in the evening of which he was killed. These occurrences furnish a logical explanation as to why the defendants attempted the life of the Chinaman, for the wounding of whom Agapito Lasada was sentenced; and they killed him not only through hatred and revenge, but also perhaps in order to prevent So Priengco from laying a complaint before the provincial authorities to the effect that Agapito Lasada served his sentence in the house of the <i>presidente<\/i> instead of in the jail.<br\/><br\/>From the foregoing relation of facts, the credibility of the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution becomes more evident and unquestionable, and with all the more reason because the witness for the prosecution, Esperidion Moldes, denied that at the hour of the crime he was fishing in the sea, or was in the habit of doing so, or that he was at the house of Mamerto Mundala for the purpose of borrowing a <i>banca<\/i>, the latter having no house in Tarragona. The other witness, Benito Resardo, also denied having been in the house of Gaudencio Belleza on the afternoon of the crime. Moreover, these two witnesses for the prosecution, Moldes and Resardo, and the third witness, Lope Margate, likewise denied that they had been, the first two, in the house of Julia So Priengco to receive instructions, for reward of P200, as to how they should testify against the defendants, and Margate denied being in the store of a Chinaman, Ong Guico, for the same purpose. Both the latter and Julia So Priengco, as well as the other Chinese said to have been present at the interview and conversation, denied that they were so present, and they contradicted the witnesses for the defense and testified that one of the latter, Tan Quico, was unfriendly to them because he had been sued for a certain sum of money by Dy Ohgco, one of those said to have been present at the said interview, and because the said Tan Quico had been rejected by Felisa So Priengco, a sister of Julia and a daughter of the deceased. Finally, the said Dy Ongco testified that he did not even know the witness Lope Margate, who was alleged to have been tampered with.<br\/><br\/>The system of defense adopted by the counsel for the defendants is clever and ingenious, for, besides attempting to prove an alibi, he also endeavored to prove that the eyewitnesses to the assault were likewise elsewhere at the time and therefore could not have seen what occurred. This defense failed, since the testimony and the circumstantial evidence, taken together as a whole and duly weighed in accordance with the rules of sound judgment, produce the completest conviction of the defendants' guilt.<br\/><br\/>In the perpetration of the homicide under prosecution, consideration must be given to the presence of the aggravating circumstances 9 and 15 of article 10 of the Penal Code, as the crime was committed in an uninhabited place and with abuse of superiority. There being no extenuating circumstance to offset them, the penalty of <i>reclusion temporal<\/i> provided by article 404 of the said code, must be imposed upon the defendants in the maximum degree, as was done in the judgment appealed from.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, whereby the errors attributed to the trial judge have been refuted, it is our opinion that the judgment appealed from should be, and is hereby, affirmed; provided, however, that Santiago and Macario Lasada shall be sentenced, jointly and severally with their accomplice, Agapito Lasada, to pay an indemnity of P1,000 to the heirs of the deceased, without subsidiary imprisonment, in accordance with article 51 of the Penal Code. Each of the defendants shall pay one-half of the costs of both instances. So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

(2)  \"In favor of the plaintiff and  against the defendants, for the sum of P7,650, with interest thereon at the  rate of 6 per cent per annum since  the  16th day of September, 1908.\" (This being the amount of two  items of the  damages as estimated by the trial court which were \"suffered by the plaintiff\" and \"caused by his ejectment from  the land in controversy\"  and  the  execution  of  the judgment of the justice of the  peace, less the sum of P540 which  the court allowed to the defendants on a  counterclaim  based upon certain advances made to the plaintiff.   As shown by the findings  of fact by the trial judge, these items of damage amounted to P7,200 on account of improvements made upon the land by the plaintiff while in possession, and P990 on account of certain personal  property of the plaintiff which was  sold at sheriff's sale in  execution of the m6ney part of the judgment  of the justice of the peace.)   (3)  In favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants for  the further sum  of P800 for each and every month, beginning with the 5th day of October, 1908, the date of the ejectment of the plaintiff under the judgment against him in the court of the justice of the peace; until the land is restored to the plaintiff, \"on account of damages arising from the plaintiff's loss in. being deprived of the proceeds .of said land,\" against which the defendants are entitled to set off the rent due from the plaintiff  since the month of October, 1907  (the time when he entered into possession), at the rate of P360 per month, less  P2,625.25, the  amount of rent  which the trial court found had already been paid at the date of the institution of this action.<\/p>\n<p align=\"center\">*       *        *       *       *       *      *<\/p>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of First Instance in this action rests upon its finding as to the existence of the relation of landlord and tenant between the parties, arising from the partial performance of the verbal rental contract; the trial judge being  of  opinion that plaintiff is entitled to specific performance of this rental contract, and damages resulting from the execution of the judgment  against  him in the summary action in the court of the justice of the peace of the city of Manila, by virtue of which he was ejected from possession of the land in question.<\/p>\n<p>But as appears from the complaint,  as well as from the evidence and the findings of the trial judge, this question as to the existence of the relation of landlord and tenant between the  parties to  this action had already been adjudicated in the summary action in the court;of the justice of the peace of  the city of Manila.  In that action, the justice of the peace  found that while this relation  did  at one time exist, the defendant in that  action, who is the plaintiff in this action, had  violated the terms of his rental contract, by his failure to pay the stipulated rent; and judgment was entered in the former  action  against the plaintiff in this action, for the recovery  of possession of the land in question and for the rent which was found to be due and unpaid.<\/p>\n<p>There can  be no doubt that if the judgment of the justice of the peace  and the facts as  found by him be deemed conclusive  in this  action,  plaintiff's prayer for specific performance of  the rental contract and for damages for the breach of this contract by the defendants must be dismissed, since the justice of the peace found that the  plaintiff in this action had neglected and  failed  to  comply with  the terms of his  rental contract in that he did not pay the rent as stipulated; that as  a  consequence the  rental  contract had been  rescinded; that  the tenant had lost his  right to possession under the  contract; and that as a result of his breach of the contract judgment should be rendered against him for possession and for the amount of the unpaid rents and damages which were shown  to have arisen under the contract and as a result of its breach by the plaintiff.<\/p>\n<p>But the trial judge was of opinion and counsel for plaintiff contend that under  the express terms of section 87 of the Code of Civil Procedure the judgment in the summary action in the  court  of the justice of the peace is not a bar to  this action in the Court of First Instance; and counsel insist that the trial judge properly disregarded the findings of  fact by the justice of the peace and rendered judgment correctly upon the facts  as developed by the evidence submitted to him.<\/p>\n<p>We do not  think that such  an application of the provisions of that section can be maintained, and as our holding on  this point  necessitates the reversal  of the  judgment of the court  below,  it becomes  important to ascertain the precise meaning and scope of the provisions of section  87 of the Code of Civil Procedure upon which appellee relies.<\/p>\n<p>Section 87 of the  Code of Civil  Procedure is as follows: <\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"Such judgment  not  conclusive in  another action.<\/em>\u2014A judgment rendered in a suit of unlawful entry and detainer, either for the  plaintiff or defendant, shall not bar an action in  the Court  of First Instance between  the  same  parties respecting title to the land or building; nor shall any judgment given therein  be held conclusive of the facts found in another action between the same parties.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Counsel  for appellee relies  on the express provisions  of the last clause of this section.<\/p>\n<p>The important question to be  determined,  then, is the meaning of the phrase \"another action between the same parties\" as used in the last clause of this section.  Does it mean every other  action  of every kind between the same parties, or is it limited to a certain  class of actions, and if  so to what actions?   It must be  admitted that read by itself, without regard to the context it would seem to include every other action of every kind between the same parties.  But such a construction would lead to the monstrous conclusion that the legislator intended that the summary proceedings authorized and provided under section 80  of the Code of Civil Procedure and its amendments should be mere expensive and vexatious farces, determining nothing, and binding no one by the adjudication.  It would permit either of the parties to one of these actions, when judgment is rendered against him by the justice of the peace or by the judge of the Court of First Instance on appeal, to institute forthwith a new action, based upon precisely the same cause of action, relating to the  identical subject matter, and  supported  by the same evidence; and to have a second adjudication in the same or in another  court, of the identical  issues solemnly adjudicated in  the former action.<\/p>\n<p>We  do not believe that it could have been  the intention of  the Code of Civil Procedure thus to set at naught those basic principles of the doctrines of <em>res judicata<\/em> which are recognized elsewhere in  that code;  for it is a general rule common to all  civilized systems of jurisprudence that \"the solemn and deliberate sentence of the law, pronounced by  its appointed organs, upon  a disputed  fact or state  of facts, should be regarded as\" a final and conclusive determination of the  question litigated, and should forever set the controversy  at rest.\"  Indeed it has  been  well  said  that this maxim is more than a mere rule of law; more even than  an important principle of public policy; and that it  is not too much to say that it is a fundamental  concept  in the organization of every jural society.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"For unless any judgment should at some point become final, and have the quality of establishing  its contents  as irrefragable truth, litigation would become interminable, the rights  of parties would be involved in endless confusion, the courts, stripped of their most efficient powers, would become little more than advisory bodies, and thus the most important function of government\u2014that of ascertaining and enforcing rights\u2014would go unfulfilled.\"   (Black on Judgments, par. 500.)<br\/>\n<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>That it was the intention of the legislator to modify, limit, and restrict the general rules based on the doctrine of res judicata in their  application to summary actions  of this nature must be admitted; and, indeed, in a former decision (Ty Laco Cioco vs. Muro, 9 Phil. Rep., 100) we pointed out the reasons which forbid the application of the general rules based on the  doctrine of res judicata in reliance upon  a judgment  in  one  of these  actions in another  action \"respecting title to real estate.\"  But no sound reason has been suggested or can be suggested for setting aside the doctrine in its entirety in relation to these actions.   On the contrary, broad principles of sound public policy, the maintenance of public order, and the rights of society, all demand that the general  rules  governing the subject of estoppel by judgment should be applied with reference to judgments in these actions as well as to all other judgments, save only in so far as their peculiar  nature as special statutory proceedings necessitates modifications or restrictions in the application of these rules.<\/p>\n<p>We think that the true meaning and effect  of the last clause of the section in question will  become apparent if it be examined in  connection with the context, and with the general principles governing the subject of res judicata as recognized and  applied in Anglo-American jurisprudence, keeping in mind the fact that the code of which it constitutes a part was enacted by a commission a majority of whose members were American lawyers,  and that its provisions were borrowed with but slight modifications from similar provisions to be found in the codes of one or other of the States of the  Union.<\/p>\n<p>The subject of <em>res judicata<\/em> or estoppel by judgment as known to Anglo-American jurisprudence is governed by two main rules uniformly recognized by the  authorities, which are very distinctly laid down and  defined by  Mr. Justice Field in the following citation from his opinion  in the case of Cromwell <b>vs.<\/b> Sac County (94 U.  S., 351):<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"In considering the operation of this judgment, it should be borne in mind, as stated by counsel, that there is a difference between the effect of a judgment as a bar or estoppel against the prosecution  of a  second  action upon  the same claim or demand, and its effect as an  estoppel in another action  between  the same parties upon a different claim or cause of action.  In the former case, the judgment,  if rendered upon the merits, constitutes an absolute bar to a subsequent action.  It is a finality as to the  claim or demand in controversy, concluding  parties and  those in privity with them, not only  as to every matter which  was offered and received to sustain or defeat the claim or demand,  but as to any other admissible  matter which might have been offered for that purpose.  Thus for example; a judgment  rendered upon a promissory note is conclusive as to the validity of the instrument and the amount due upon it, although it be subsequently alleged that perfect defenses  actually existed, of which no proof was  offered, such as forgery,  want of consideration, or payment.  If such defenses were not presented in the action, and established by competent evidence, the subsequent allegation of their existence is of  no legal consequence.  The  judgment  is as conclusive,  so far as future  proceedings at law are concerned, as though the defenses never existed.   The language,  therefore,  which is so often used, that a  judgment estops not only as  to every ground of recovery or defense actually presented  in the action, but also as to  every ground which might have been presented, is strictly accurate, when applied to the demand or claim  in controversy.   Such demand or claim, having passed into judgment, cannot  again be brought into  litigation  between the parties  in proceedings at law upon any ground whatever.<\/p>\n<p>\"But where the second action between the same parties is upon a different claim or demand, the judgment in the prior action operates  as an estoppel only as to those matters in issue or points controverted upon the determination of which the finding or verdict was rendered.  In all  cases, therefore, where it is sought to apply the estoppel of a judgment rendered upon  one cause of action to  matters arising in a suit upon a different cause of action, the inquiry must always be as to the point or question actually litigated and determined in the original action; not what might have been thus litigated and determined.  Only upon such matters is the judgment conclusive in another action.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The rules thus referred to in the opinion  of Mr. Justice Field may be summarily stated as follows :<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li> A judgment  rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction on  the merits is a bar to any future suit between the  same parties or their privies upon the  same cause of action so long as it remains unreversed.<br\/>\n<br\/>\n<\/li>\n<li> A point which was actually and directly in  issue in a former suit and was there judicially passed upon and determined by a domestic  court  of competent jurisdiction cannot be  again  drawn in question  in any future action between the  same parties or their privies, even  when the causes of action in the two suits are wholly different.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>These two main rules mark a sharp distinction between the principles governing the two typical cases in which a judgment may operate as evidence.   No intelligent discussion of the subject of <em>res judicata<\/em> or of the multitude of authorities and varying statutes touching that subject can be maintained without keeping clearly in mind the distinction between the  principles  governing these two typical cases. Indeed, in speaking of these cases the term \"bar by former judgment\" is uniformly employed to indicate the case governed  by the first general rule  above laid down; and the phrase \"conclusiveness of the judgment\" in referring to the second.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The differences between the two cases are found chiefly in two regards, viz: as  respects  the identity  of the subject matter in the successive suits, and as respects the scope of the estoppel,  as to the matters determined by it.\"  (Black on Judgments, par. 506.)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>With these two  rules in mind a critical examination  of the provisions of the section under consideration (87 of the Code of Civil Procedure) will leave but little room for doubt as to their true meaning  and  effect.  Manifestly, the  first provision of  the section treats of cases falling under the first rule, and the second treats  of cases falling under the second  rule.  The first provision sets  out the  case where the first of the above mentioned rules, that is,  the rule as to a <em>\"bar by former judgment,\"<\/em> shall not be applicable in relation to these  summary actions.  In the language of the section  itself, \"a judgment rendered in a suit of unlawful entry and  detainer\u2014<em>shall not bar an action<\/em>\u2014between the same parties <em>respecting title to the land in question.<\/em>\" While the second provision which is contained in the last clause of the section, quite  as clearly has for its object the forbidding in toto of the application with reference to these actions of the second of  the above-mentioned rules, that is to say, the rule touching the \"collusiveness of the judgment.\"  To quote the provision  itself: \"Nor shall any judgment given therein be held  conclusive of the facts found  in another action between the same parties.\"<\/p>\n<p>The two provisions refer to wholly separate and distinct cases, and are to  be  construed by reference to the two main rules of the doctrine of <em>res judicata<\/em> or estoppel by judgment to which they refer.  We conclude, therefore, that the prohibition of the application of the rule  touching a \"bar by judgment\" in an action  respecting the title to the land or buildings which  is  contained in  the  first provision of the section, leaves this rule intact in all other cases; so that as to the actions of unlawful entry and  detainer it may be said that, <em>except  as to actions respecting title to the land or buildings in question,<\/em> the first general rule remains in  full force and effect, and \"a'judgment rendered (in an action of unlawful entry and detainer) by a court of competent jurisdiction  on  the merits, is, a bar to any future suit  between the same parties or their privies upon the same cause of action so long as  it remains unreversed;\" or in the language of Mr. Justice Field in the opinion just cited:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"It is a finality as  to the claim  or demand in controversy, concluding parties and those in privity  with them, not only as to every matter which was offered and received to sustain^. or defeat the claim or demand, but as to any other admissible\" matter which might have been dffered for that purpose.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>And we conclude that the language of the last clause of the section has for its object the prohibition of the application, with reference to judgments in these summary actions, of the rule touching \"collusiveness of judgments,\" which prescribes that points at issue in a former suit, once judicially passed upon and determined, may not again be drawn in question  in a future action between the same  parties, even when the  cause of action is different.   So  that the clause used therein \"another action between the same parties\" must be understood to refer <em>to other actions based upon another claim or demand, that is to say, upon a  different cause of action.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>That this  is the correct construction of the section under consideration  will also  be made apparent if we  consider the scope and object of these  statutory actions of unlawful entry and detainer, and the reasons  which require certain limitations and restrictions, in  the application to them of the general rules based upon the doctrine of <em>res judicata.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>In this connection a recurrence to the history and nature of these actions as known to Anglo-American jurisprudence will be of some service.   In the earliest days of the English common law any person disseized of his lands who had not lost his right of entry thereto was authorized with force and arms to enter upon such lands and by force and arms to retain its possession.  Possibly, however, this rule, even at that early  time, was subject to some qualification such as that the entry must not be by a breach of the public peace.  In any event this, licentious course of procedure by giving an opportunity to powerful men under  the pretense of feigned title io eject their weaker neighbors, or by force to retain a  wrongful possession, made it  necessary to  restrain such men from the use of all violent methods of doing themselves justice.. As far back as 2 Edward III, the statute  of Northampton,  and again in the 5 and 10 Richard II,  additional statutes were enacted, controlling the subject.   And a general revision of the law on this subject was made in 8 Henry VI, which is substantially the origin of existing  law and of  the prohibitory statutes in England and the United States upon  the subject of forcible entry and detainer  as known to  Anglo-American jurisprudence. (2 Edw. Ill,  c. 3; 5 Ric. II,  c. 8; 15 Ric.  II, c. 2; 8 Hen. VI, c. 9.  See remarks of Chief Justice Bigelow in Presbrey vs. Presbrey, 13 Alien, 281, 284.)<\/p>\n<p>The proceedings under  this statute were originally  by indictment and purely criminal  in nature, though at the complaint of the injured party; but by the statute of Henry VI, the court before whom the cause was tried, although by indictment,  had authority to  order the restitution of the detained estate to the party  entitled to it; and it is said that perhaps generally, now,  in those States in which the statute of Henry  VI has been followed, the  prosecution under the statute is ordinarily a public prosecution by indictment.   Indeed it will be found that <em>forcible entry<\/em> and detainer is  perhaps more commonly treated by  textbook writers as a crime to be punished by indictment, than as a mere civil wrong to be redressed in civil action.<\/p>\n<p>The statutes of the several  States of the United States are substantially based on these prohibitory English statutes, and, speaking generally, they declare that no entry shall be made into land or other possessions  but in cases where an entry is given by law; and in such cases only in a peaceable manner, and not with a strong hand, nor with multitude of people.  Many of these statutes then proceed to punish any violation of the law by imprisonment as a public offense; and at the same time restore  to the aggrieved person the possession of the premises from which he had been forcibly ejected or detained.  Although the proceedings were originally in the form of a criminal prosecution, by  gradual addition to the early prohibitory statutes or provisions looking to the restitution of the property to the party dispossessed, the remedy has, in general, become  a private rather than a public one, although the form of the proceeding, the rules of law which govern it, and the jurisdiction of the court wherein it may be maintained remain to a great degree unchanged.<\/p>\n<p>This course of legislation, however, can be explained only upon  the theory that  these statutory summary actions of unlawful entry and detainer are not processes to determine the actual title to an estate, nor to determine the right of entry to an estate, but simply quieting processes by virtue of which a party in possession  of  an estate  may not be dispossessed of that estate by force; the law preserving his possession to him in a summary  manner until the right of ownership or of possession can be tried in due course of law and by due process of law rather  than left to be determined by the relative strength of the parties.<\/p>\n<p>In the course of time ft was seen  that public policy and the convenience of land owners would be subserved by extending the scope of the original action of  unlawful entry and detainer (which, formerly, was only allowed to one who had been deprived of possession of land or buildings by force and violence)  to landlords against whom tenants unlawfully held property rented by  them,  and in general, to persons detaining lands  or buildings despite the existence of contract obligations to surrender possession thereof.   Thus the right to a summary action of this nature, which had long been extended generally in the United States to persons deprived of the physical possession of real  estate by force and arms, has been further extended by statute in many jurisdictions so as to include all cases wherein a person \"against whom the possession of land or a building is unlawfully withheld by his tenant, vendee, vendor, or other person after the expiration of his right by contract, express or implied, to hold possession\" is deprived of, possession.  This is substantially the form  of  the statute  as adopted in the Code  of  Civil Procedure for the Philippine Islands,  These aptions, even as modified by statute, being in their essence mere  quieting processes, original jurisdiction therein was and is continued in the courts of the justices of the peace, wherein criminal prosecutions were had  in  the early history  of proceedings of this nature;  and this notwithstanding the fact that the right to the immediate possession of real estate is summarily adjudicated therein, and  notwithstanding the further fact that the value of the property in  question and  the amount of damages which may be allowed far, exceed the limit of the jurisdiction of these courts in ordinary actions.<\/p>\n<p>Manifestly, then, the peculiar nature of these actions, as mere quieting processes, and not processes to determine the actual title to an  estate; and as summary actions in a court not of record wherein questions affecting real estate are often incidentally adjudicated,  without regard  to the value of the real estate or the amount of damages involved; necessitated and necessitates the modification of the general rules based on the doctrine of <em>res judicata<\/em> when applied with reference to them; or more correctly stated, the principles on which the doctrine of <em>res judicata<\/em> is based, when applied with relation to these actions, results in various modifications of the general rules derived from these principles as applied to ordinary actions.<\/p>\n<p>We have already shown in the case of Ty Laco Cioco <em>vs.<\/em> Muro (9 Phil. Rep., 100)  that the issue in an action of this nature being in general the mere naked possession in fact, a judgment in such an action should not, on principle, be deemed a bar to another action between the same parties \"respecting title to real estate;\"  and having in mind the summary nature of these actions, the fact that they are tried originally in a  court not of  record, and  the further  fact that although tried in the courts of the justices of the peace, no limitation is set upon the  value of the property affected thereby, it will  readily  be understood  that the legislator might well  deem it unwise and unsafe to permit the facts found in such actions to be held conclusive in other actions between the same parties <em>\"upon a different  claim or cause of action.\"<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Section 87 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as we hold, expressly  provides for these  two cases wherein  as  we have seen, the history and nature of these actions  seem to render it necessary or expedient that the general rules derived from the doctrine  of <em>res judicata<\/em>  should  be modified.  But no sufficient  reason has  been or can be advanced (either on principle or adduced from an examination of the language of this section itself) for holding that a judgment rendered in an action of this nature should not constitute an absolute bar to a subsequent action (not an action respecting title to real estate) between the same parties upon the same claim or  demand:  and a finality as to the claim or demand in controversy,  \"concluding the parties  and those in  privity with them, not only as to every  matter which was  offered and received to sustain or defeat the claim or demand, but as to  any other admissible matter which  might have  been offered for that purpose.\"   (Quotation from decision Cromwell <em>vs.<\/em> Sac County, <em>supra<\/em>; Hurley <em>vs.<\/em> Lamoreaux, 29 Minn., 138; Cobb <em>vs<\/em>. Arnold, 12 Met., 39; Jones <em>vs.<\/em> Reynolds, 7 Car. &amp; P. 335; Riverside Co. <em>vs.<\/em> Townsend, 120 Ill., 9; Fish <em>vs.<\/em> Benson,  71 Cal.,  428; Mattox  <em>vs.<\/em> Helm,  15 Am. Dec, 64; Mitchell <em>vs.<\/em> Davis, 23 Cal, 381; Norwood <em>vs.<\/em> Kirfcy, 70 Ala., 397; Black on Judgments, par. 506, also par. 663.)<\/p>\n<p>What  has been said  heretofore in this opinion has had reference more especially to ordinary actions, anciently and technically known as actions of  \"Forcible  Entry and Detainer;\" but a little  reflection will show that with  some slight modifications, our conclusions are equally applicable to that special class of statutory actions, which are called by  this name, and whereby \"a landlord, vendor, vendee, or other person against whom the possession of land  or  a building  is unlawfully  withheld by  his tenant,  vendee, vendor, or other person, after the expiration of his right by contract, express or implied, to hold possession\" may recover possession.  It may be admitted, perhaps,  that there is  some anomaly in treating these actions as on precisely the same footing as the ancient action of forcible entry  and detainer, but the legislator has not seen fit  to make any  practical distinction.   Our statute, in express terms, places them in the same category and, in  experience, no great inconvenience has been found to result therefrom.<\/p>\n<p>It necessarily results, therefore, that a judgment in an action instituted under section 80 of the Code  of Civil  Procedure and its amendments, wherein recovery is sought of the possession of leased premises  from an alleged tenant by one claiming to be his  landlord,  is a  bar to a  subsequent action between  the  same parties upon the same claim or demand, and a finality as to the claim or demand  in controversy, concluding parties and those in privity with them, not only as to every matter which was offered and received to sustain or defeat the claim or demand, but as to  any other admissible matter which  might have been offered for that purpose\u2014that is to say, it is conclusive in such cases as to the facts upon which the justice of the peace must have rested or might have  rested his  decision.  It is conclusive therefore of the fact of  the existence of the  relation, of landlord and tenant between the parties, of the  execution of a rental contract, of the right of possession thereunder, and  that the contract as  executed had  or had not expired or had or had not been violated; and it is conclusive further as to the terms of the contract, where a judgment for rent or damages is based on  the construction placed  on those terms by the justice of the peace.<\/p>\n<p>Before closing the general discussion it may be  well to direct attention to the reasoning  of our decision in the case of Tanguinlay vs. Quiros  (10 Phil. Rep., 360) wherein we held that sections 306 and  307 of the Code of Civil Procedure are not to be construed as changing1 the \"general American rule\" based on the doctrine of res judicata therein laid down. Similar reasoning, ree'nforced by the fact that .as to actions of unlawful entry and detainer the subject is  largely controlled by the special provisions of the code relating thereto, justify us in holding,  without further  argument, that  the rules hereinbefore laid down are not in  conflict  with  the provisions  of  sections 306  and  307 of the  Code of Civil Procedure.<\/p>\n<p>Having arrived at our  conclusion that the provisions of section 87 of the Code of Civil Procedure do not limit or restrict the application of the general  rules based  on  the doctrine  of <em>res  judicata <\/em> as  developed in Anglo-American jurisprudence in reliance on judgments  in forcible entry and  detainer actions, <em>save only so far  as  that  sectidn  expressly  provides  that  such  actions  shall not be  a  bar to another action respecting title to real estate, and so far as it provides further that the facts found in a judgment in such an action shall not be conclusive in another action between the parties upon ,a different claim or cause of action; it only remains to apply these rules in the case at bar.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>It is contended that, even under these rules, the judgment in the action of unlawful detainer cannot be held as  a bar to the present action, because this is an action for specific performance and  for damages for nonfulfillment of a contract, and therefore wholly different in form and not within the  jurisdiction of the justice of the peace  who tried the former action; and further because Demetrio Tuason appears to  have been the sole plaintiff in the former action, while in  the present action he is joined as defendant with the  coowners of the land in question.<\/p>\n<p>The first contention is in direct conflict with the doctrine laid down  in  our decision in the case of Tanguinlay <em>vs.<\/em> Quiros  (10 Phil.  Rep., 360), wherein we pointed  out that \"courts of the present day are not concerned so much with the form of actions as with their substance\/' and held that despite a difference in the form  of the action, nevertheless the doctrine of <em>res judicata <\/em>would be applied where it appeared that the parties in the two suits were in truth \"litigating for the same thing.\"<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"It is a well-settled rule, and one that is supported by a multitude of authorities, that a party cannot, by varying the form of action, or  adopting a different method of presenting his case, escape the operation of  the principle that one and the same cause of action shall not be twice litigated between the same  parties or their privies.\"  (Black on Judgments, par.  729,  and many cases cited.)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>As stated in Hardin <em>vs.<\/em> Palmerlee (28 Minn., 450), the rule  is\u2014<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"That the remedy sought, or  the mere form  of action, may be different, does not prevent the estoppel of the former adjudication.  If,  upon  the facts in issue in the former action, the plaintiff was entitled in that action to a remedy such as the law awards as compensation or redress for the alleged wrong, or if, upon those facts, he was entitled to no remedy, adjudication of his right to recover in that action bars his right to  afterwards seek a different remedy upon the same facts or  cause of action.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>In the case at  bar, the claim of the plaintiff that he  is entitled to possession of the land in  question, by virtue of his oral contract  and the due performance by him  of the conditions of that contract,  would have  been a complete defense in the action for unlawful detainer if it had been duly alleged and established by competent evidence; hence the adverse  adjudication of plaintiff's claim  of  a right to possession in the former action is a complete bar  to his right now to seek  to enforce this claim in an action different in  form, but based on the same facts.  For the purpose of ascertaining the identity of the causes of action the authorities  generally agree in accepting the following test  as sufficient:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Would the same evidence support  and establish both the present and the former cause of action ?  If so, the former recovery is a bar; if otherwise, it does not  stand in the way of  the former action.\"   (See many cases cited in note 262, Black on Judgments, par. 726.)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>It  is very clear, that the  facts  on which  the cause  of action in the case at bar is predicated, had they been pleaded and proven  in the former action in the court of the justice of  the peace, would have been a complete defense to that action.  It follows, that under the rule just laid  down, the cause of action in the  present case  must be held  to be identical with the cause of action in the former case.<\/p>\n<p>The contention that the former action is not a bar  to the present action because  the  parties to the  two actions are not absolutely identical, is not supported either by reason or  authority.   While it  is true that  in general, upon the principle that estoppels must be mutual, no person is entitled to take advantage of a  former judgment or decree, as decisive in his favor of a matter in controversy, unless,  being a party or a privy thereto, he would  have  been prejudiced by it had the decision been the other way; and that judgments and decrees are conclusive evidence of facts only as between parties and privies to the litigation; nevertheless\u2014<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"It is not always a  conclusive objection to the  admissibility of a record as an estoppel or as a bar that the parties to the former action included some who are not joined in the second action, or <em>vice versa.<\/em> \"The fact that parties in the first suit are not identically the same as  those in the second, when the first case was decided  on the merits, and not upon an exception to joinder or nonjoinder of parties, is certainly no  answer to the plea  (of  former recovery), otherwise, no matter how often a  case  be  decided, the parties might renew the litigation by simply joining with them a new party.'  'The objection that the first action was between other parties is not well grounded, and has no basis in fact to  rest it upon the principle of <em>res inter altos acta.<\/em>   That principle applies where the party against whom the record is offered was not himself a party to it.  In such case, the general rule is that the  record is not admissible. But here this defendant was a party to that record, and the objection  in fact is that other persons  were  also parties thereto.  As we understand the rule, that single fact alone constitutes no  valid objection  to the  admission of the record.\"   (Black on Judgments, par. 543, and cases  cited in support of the text.)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The complaint alleges that the oral rental  contract by virtue of which  plaintiff was in possession of the land from which he was ejected under the judgment of the justice of the peace was entered into with Mariano Tuason, and subsequently ratified  by Demetrio  Tuason acting for himself and the other defendants. Demetrio Tuason was the plaintiff in the action in the court of  the justice of the peace, whether acting for himself alone or acting for himself and the other defendants is not satisfactorily disclosed, by the pleadings.  The complaint  in  the present action alleges that  he was acting for himself and his codefendants, but this allegation is put in doubt by the record itself, wherein Demetrio Tuason appears as sole plaintiff.   But in either event, it is very clear that the facts alleged in the complaint in this action had they been proven in the former action would have been  a complete defense in that action.  The justice of the peace found that the oral contract on which plaintiff relies was a rental  contract between the plaintiff and Demetrio Tuason, and held that it had been violated by the  plaintiff by his nonpayment of rent.   Manifestly the defendant Demetrio Tuason is entitled to rely on the judgment of the justice of the peace as a bar to this action for specific performance of that contract in so far, at least, as he is concerned.  But, in the very nature of things, and under the allegations of  the complaint, specific performance could not be  decreed against  the other defendants in this action unless judgment were rendered at the same time against this defendant.  It is very clear,  therefore, that as to the principal relief sought, that is to say, the specific performance of the contract, the plaintiff  cannot be allowed to resort to the transparent device of joining with  this defendant new parties defendant in order to object to the  admissibility of the record in the former case on the ground that the parties are not identical.   As to the damages claimed for plaintiff's ejectment, it  is very clear under the allegations of the complaint, that unless the parties defendant to this action other than Demetrio  Tuason, were  privies  to him as party plaintiff in  the former action, the plaintiff has no cause of action  against them for damages  resulting from his ejection under the judgment entered by the justice of the peace.  For if they  were not privies, Demetrio  Tuason was alone responsible for the institution and maintenance of that action.  But if they were privies, the objection based on a lack of identity of parties has no foundation, and the former judgment must be held  to be a complete bar to this action on the  principle that both the parties and their privies were bound by the judgment in the former action.<\/p>\n<p>We conclude that the  trial  judge  erred in overruling the plea of <em>res judicata<\/em> filed in the court below, and that judgment should therefore be entered reversing the judgment entered therein,  and dismissing  the  complaint,  without special condemnation of costs in this instance.   So ordered.<\/p>\n<p><em>Torres<\/em> and <em>Trent, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<\/p>\n<p><em> Mapa, Johnson,<\/em> and <em>Moreland, JJ.,<\/em> concur as to the dispositive part.<br\/>\n<\/p>\n<\/div>",

The\u00a0 officers pursued him and, when they were about to catch up with him, called upon him to recognize\u00a0 the authority of the law; the defendant\u00a0 faced them and said: \"Please do not approach, lest you bring misfortune upon yourselves, for the dagger I have is stained with blood.\"\u00a0\u00a0 They in fact noticed that Ramos\u00a0 held a bloody dagger in his hand and that his right hand was also\u00a0 stained with blood.\u00a0 After saying these words, the defendant continued\u00a0 to run along\u00a0 Calle Paz and headed toward some land planted with nipa-palms, among which he entered.\u00a0 As the policemen were unarmed, for they were not on duty at\u00a0 the time, they called some other officers, by means of their whistles, and started for\u00a0 the municipal building to get their arms.\u00a0\u00a0 While on their way they advised three policemen, who had responded to their call, to watch the place where\u00a0 Numeriano Ramos had entered, but, upon their return thereto, were unable to find the defendant.<\/p><p>As soon as the wounded man, Severino de Chaves, arrived at the municipal\u00a0 building, the justice\u00a0 of the peace, Julian Calzado, in view of Chaves' serious\u00a0 condition\u00a0 and the statement that he was dying, took his sworn declaration in the form of written questions and answers, in which the patient declared that he had been wounded in the abdomen and the left hand by Numeriano Ramos.\u00a0 This statement was made by Chaves\u00a0 to those in the municipal\u00a0 building\u00a0 who were present, and was heard by the said policemen, Aesquivel and Javier, when they went to and were in this building for the purpose of getting their arms.<\/p><p>The examination of the wounded man by the\u00a0 physician, Vicente Ramos, disclosed that he bore\u00a0 an\u00a0 angular-shaped wound, two centimeters in length by\u00a0 two\u00a0 and\u00a0 a half in depth, from left\u00a0 to right, in the upper part of\u00a0 the hypogastric region, produced by a sharp-pointed,\u00a0 cutting instrument and of undeterminable diagnosis, owing to the complications which might ensue on account of its\u00a0 proximity to important organs; a wound of about\u00a0 three centimeters in length in the palm of the left hand, affecting the skin and the soft parts, curable in seven days; and other wounds in the under side of the last phalanges of the fingers of the left hand, produced by a cutting instrument and, likewise, curable in seven days. On the night of the\u00a0 following day, the 17th, Severino de Chaves died, as a result of the wound in the abdomen.<\/p><p>For the foregoing reasons, and in view of the preliminary investigation made, the provincial fiscal filed an information in the Court of First Instance of the province, on October 23, 1910, charging Numeriano Ramos with the crime of murder, and, upon the institution of this case, the judgment appealed from was rendered.<\/p><p>There was\u00a0 no\u00a0 eyewitness to\u00a0 the deadly assault\u00a0 upon Severino de Chaves in Calle Fe,\u00a0 of the <em>pueblo<\/em>\u00a0 of Balayan, between 8 and 9 o'clock of the night of the 16th of June; 1910, the only neighbor, Pedro Ramirez, who responded to the cry of a person who was calling for help, saying that he was going to be killed, upon arrival at the place whence the cry had come, found Chaves stretched out on the ground and dangerously wounded, and he died on the following day. Ramirez did not\u00a0 witness the assault which Chaves said Numeriano\u00a0 Ramos had made upon him a\u00a0 few\u00a0 moments before, and did not see the latter at the place of the crime. These\u00a0 facts, perfectly proven\u00a0 in the present\u00a0 case,\u00a0 are characteristic of the crime of homicide, provided for and punished by article 404 of the Penal Code, as the\u00a0 record does not show the presence of any of the qualifying circumstances enumerated in article 403 of the said code.<\/p><p>The evidence furnishes full and conclusive proof\u00a0 of\u00a0 the guilt of the defendant, Numeriano Ramos, as the sole perpetrator by direct participation, fully convicted, of the homicide in\u00a0 question.\u00a0\u00a0 From the first moment that the wounded Chaves had Pedro Ramirez at his side, who had\u00a0 come in response to his cries for help, he freely stated to the latter that he had been\u00a0 assaulted and\u00a0 wounded\u00a0 by Numeriano Ramos, and, fearing that the wound he had received in\u00a0 the hypogastric region was dangerous and that he should\u00a0 die of it, he begged Ramirez to take him to the municipal building, where he repeated the same statements to his wife, Gliceria Caliope,\u00a0 to the physician, and to the justice\u00a0 of\u00a0 the peace, Julian Calzado, who took his sworn declaration, saying repeatedly to all these parties, as well as\u00a0 to the corporal, Mauricio Aesquivel, and to the policeman,\u00a0 Teofllo Javier, that he felt badly and\u00a0 was going\u00a0 to die as\u00a0 a result\u00a0 of the wound inflicted in his abdomen by the defendant, and that he had given up all hope of living. At the very time that Pedro Ramirez came up to\u00a0 help the unfortunate Severino Chaves,\u00a0 who was lying at full length in the street aforementioned, the defendant was seen\u00a0 in the same street by the police officers, Mauricio Aesquivel and Teofilo Javier, who chanced to be walking along there; his right hand was stained with blood\u00a0 and grasped a dagger or pocketknife, which was likewise bloody; he\u00a0 would not halt on being commanded to do so, and, after threatening the said officers, ran\u00a0 toward the inner part of a piece of land planted\u00a0 to\u00a0 nipa-palms; all of which conduct\u00a0 on the part of the defendant, Numeriano\u00a0 Ramos, as well as the\u00a0 circumstances of having blood on his right hand and his carrying at the time a weapon also\u00a0 stained with blood, constitute grave and\u00a0 conclusive\u00a0 circumstantial evidence of his\u00a0 guilt, as derived from facts duly proven.<\/p><p>And if, to the testimony of several trustworthy witnesses who heard the ante-mortem statements of the deceased, and to the aforementioned\u00a0 circumstantial evidence, there be added the corroborative evidence derived from the defendant's disappearance from the place of his residence, without his being found from the night of the crime, June, 16, 1910, until he was arrested by the Constabulary, on the 7th of the following month of October, whic\"h is also circumstantial evidence\u00a0 of guilt\u00a0 all these data combined\u00a0 and weighed together in connection with the other merits of the case, in accordance with the rules of\u00a0 sane judgment and good common sense, produce in the mind a full\u00a0 conviction of the guilt of the defendant, beyond all reasonable doubt, as the sole proved perpetrator\u00a0 of the mortal\u00a0 wound inflicted upon the deceased, Severino de Chaves.<\/p><p>The defendant pleaded not guilty, but,\u00a0 notwithstanding his denial and his exculpatory allegations, absolutely devoid of proof and shown at trial to be completely false,\u00a0 the record discloses full\u00a0 and irrefutable proof that, on account of resentment\u00a0 and trouble with\u00a0 the\u00a0 deceased\u00a0 and the latter's wife, and without\u00a0 just or legitimate motive, he assaulted and\u00a0 inflicted the mortal wound upon\u00a0 the hapless\u00a0 Chaves.<br\/><\/p><p>Thus it is not true that the defendant, on the\u00a0 night and hour of the crime, was, as he\u00a0 alleged, at his\u00a0 brother Teofilo's house in company with Melecio Daola and\u00a0 Candida Ramos, at a\u00a0 considerable distance from\u00a0 the place of the\u00a0 crime, because, besides this brother, who corroborated his allegation, his other relatives, Daola and Candida, were not presented as witnesses in his defense; and it is undeniable that, a few moments after the crime, the policemen,\u00a0 Aesquivel and\u00a0 Javier, saw him walking fast\u00a0 with\u00a0 his right hand covered with\u00a0 blood and\u00a0 carrying a bladed weapon, also bloody, in the\u00a0 same street where the deceased was assaulted and found stretched upon the ground. <\/p><p>Ramos alleged, in justification of his conduct, that he had accompanied the deceased to Sablayan, Mindoro, to do some business in connection with stock, under the promise made to him that he should receive one-third of the profits; but that afterwards, notwithstanding that the\u00a0 business produced\u00a0 a profit of P1,200, the deceased refused to give him even so much as two pesos, and would give him no money at all\u00a0 in spite of his requests and the fact that his family had nothing to\u00a0 eat, wherefore he was obliged to borrow some money from Domingo de Jesus, who corroborated this latter\u00a0 statement.\u00a0 The wife of the deceased, however, contradicted the defendant.\u00a0 She testified that it was not true that her husband owed him\u00a0 any sum whatever, for the reason that she paid him P20 for his services\u00a0 in accompanying her husband to Mindoro, in accordance with the agreement made, and ?10 more\u00a0 for\u00a0 getting\u00a0 four head of stock,\u00a0 left\u00a0 on that island; so that the defendant, when\u00a0 he with his family left the deceased's residence, was able to buy a\u00a0 house for P30.\u00a0\u00a0 This testimony was corroborated\u00a0 by Julian Caliope.<\/p><p>Judging, from the testimony of the deceased's\u00a0 wife, the motive of the attempt against the life of her deceased husband appears to have been the following: One week after the return of her husband and the defendant from Mindoro the former received a letter from Rufino Papa,\u00a0 in whose house in Sablayan, Mindoro, they had\u00a0 lodged, informing the deceased and witness\u00a0 that the defendant\u00a0 had abstracted or stolen money from his house; therefore witness and her husband\u00a0 begged Ramos to tell the truth, and in fact\u00a0 he confessed\u00a0 to\u00a0 them that he did take the\u00a0 money,\u00a0 but\u00a0 when Chaves was about to write to Papa, Ramos told these spouses that he could not admit the charge,\u00a0 as he had\u00a0 not\u00a0 been caught in the act; then witness and her husband both reproached the defendant, asking him\u00a0 how he could\u00a0 act\u00a0 in such wise, since\u00a0 they\u00a0 were willing to pay for what had been stolen; at this the defendant\u00a0 took offense and with his family left Chaves' house.\u00a0 One week after this occurrence, the deceased was assaulted and mortally wounded in the street.<\/p><p>In the commission of the crime, there\u00a0 is no extenuating or aggravating circumstance to be considered, since it does not\u00a0 appear that the\u00a0 defendant chose\u00a0 and took advantage of the\u00a0 darkness of the night for the purpose of killing Severino de Chaves.<\/p><p>With respect to the\u00a0 errors\u00a0 assigned by\u00a0 the\u00a0 defense to the judgment appealed from, it is sufficient for the purposes of this\u00a0 decision to state that,\u00a0 in view of the fact that a person\u00a0 had been seriously wounded and\u00a0 repeatedly designated his assailant, the\u00a0 justice of the peace\u00a0 proceeded properly, in accordance with law, by conducting the required preliminary investigation and ordering the\u00a0 capture of the designated author of the crime, since he was not found and had disappeared from the place of his residence.\u00a0 The provisions of section 41 of Act No. 1627 were complied with,<\/p><p>An information having been filed by the provincial fiscal, the judge acted according to law in confirming the imprisonment of the defendant and refusing to\u00a0 release him; and no error was committed by permitting the fiscal to amend the date of the year of the complaint, inasmuch as the said amendment, made by\u00a0 striking out the last word and substituting in lieu thereof \"1910,\"\u00a0 impaired none of the rights of the defendant, who well knew that he committed the crime on the night of June 16th, 1910, and not in June, 1911.<\/p><p>As regards the declaration made by the deceased several hours prior to his death, and which was taken into account in the judgment appealed from,\u00a0 it must be observed that his repeated statements made before various persons, and, under oath, to the justice of the peace, relative to his dangerous wound, his approaching death without hope of living, the identity of his aggressor, and to the\u00a0 circumstances of the assault made upon\u00a0 him, are admissible in a criminal action with the testimony of the witnesses who heard such statements, according to off-expressed opinions in the decisions of this court, which have already become well-settled legal doctrine.\u00a0\u00a0 (U. S. <em>vs<\/em>. Montes, 6 Phil. Rep.,\u00a0 443;\u00a0 U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Gil,\u00a0 13 Phil. Rep.,\u00a0 530; and\u00a0 U. S. <em>vs<\/em>. Castellon, 12 Phil. Rep., 160.)<\/p><p>Even granting the truth of the supposition\u00a0 advanced\u00a0 by the defense, that the\u00a0 fear and\u00a0 nervousness felt by the deceased were more the cause of his death than the gravity of his wound, it must nevertheless be borne in mind that' he who inflicted the serious wound which caused the death of Severino de Chaves is responsible\u00a0 for the consequences that ensued, and\u00a0 that the physical condition and\u00a0 temperament of the wounded man\u00a0 can be no reason for lessening or reducing the extent of such harm, because the gravity of the injury caused is measured by the results it produces; therefore,\u00a0 if the\u00a0 wound\u00a0 inflicted\u00a0 upon the\u00a0 offended party was a determinative cause of his death, it is unquestionable that the crime should\u00a0 be classified\u00a0 as homicide.<\/p><p>For all\u00a0 the\u00a0 foregoing\u00a0 reasons,\u00a0 and since the judgment appealed\u00a0 from, the errors\u00a0 assigned\u00a0 to\u00a0 which\u00a0 have\u00a0 been refuted, is in accordance with the law, it is, proper, in our opinion, to affirm\u00a0 and we hereby affirm the said judgment, with\u00a0 the costs against the appellant.<\/p><p><em> Arellano, C.

Articles 532 and 950 of the Code of Commerce have not, therefore, been violated, for they are not applicable to\u00a0 the case at bar.<\/p><p>Neither are articles\u00a0 309\u00a0 of the Code\u00a0 of Commerce and 1955 and 1962 of the Civil\u00a0 Code applicable.\u00a0 The first of these articles reads thus:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"Whenever, with the consent of the depositor, the depositary disposes of the articles on deposit\u00a0 either for himself or for his business,\u00a0 or for\u00a0 transactions intrusted to him by the former, the rjghts and obligations of the depositary. and of the depositor shall cease, and the rules and provisions applicable to the commercial loans, commission, or contract which took the place\u00a0 of the deposit shall\u00a0 be observed.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The appellants\u00a0 say that,\u00a0 in\u00a0 accordance\u00a0 with this legal provision, the paddy\u00a0 received on deposit ceased to\u00a0 continue under such character in order to remain in their possession under the contract of hire of services, in virtue whereof they could change\u00a0 it by returning rice instead of paddy and a half less than the quantity received.\u00a0 They further say that the ownership of personal property, according to article 1955 of the Civil Code,\u00a0 prescribes by uninterrupted possession for six years, without the necessity\u00a0 of any other condition, and in accordance with article 1962 of the same Code real\u00a0 actions, with regard tp personal property, prescribe after the lapse of six years from the loss of possession.<\/p><p>Two questions are presented\u00a0 in these allegations: One regarding the nature of the obligation contracted by the appellants; and the. other regarding prescription, not for a period of three years, but\u00a0\u00a0 of six years.<\/p><p>With reference to the first, it is acknowledged that the obligation of the appellants arose primarily out of the contract of deposit, but this deposit was later converted into\u00a0 a contract of hire of services and this is true.\u00a0\u00a0 But it is also true that, after the object of\u00a0 the hire of services had been fulfilled, the rice, in every way remained as a deposit in the possession of the appellants for them to return to the depositor at any time\u00a0 they might be required to do so, and nothing has relieved them of this obligation; neither the dissolution of the partnership that united them, nor the revolutionary movement of a political character\u00a0 that seems to have occurred in 1898, nor the fact that they may at some time have lost possession of the rice.<\/p><p>With reference to the second question, or\u00a0 under title of deposit or hire of services, the possession of the appellants can in no way amount to prescription, for the thing received on deposit or for hire\u00a0 of services could not prescribe, since for every prescription of ownership the possession must be in the\u00a0 capacity of an\u00a0 owner, public, peaceful,\u00a0 and uninterrupted (Civil Code, 1941) ; and\u00a0 the Appellants\u00a0 could not possess the rice in the capacity of owners, taking for granted that the depositor or lessor never could have believed that he had transferred to them ownership of the thing deposited or leased, but merely the care of the thing on deposit and the use or profit thereof; which is expressed in legal terms by saying that the possession of the depositary or of the lessee is not adverse to that of the depositor or lessor,\u00a0 who continues to\u00a0 be the owner of the thing\u00a0 which is merely held in trust by the depositary or lessee.<\/p><p>In\u00a0 strict law, the deposit, when it is of fungible goods received by weight, number,\u00a0 or measurement, becomes a mutual\u00a0 loan, by reason of the\u00a0 authorization'\u00a0 which the depositary may\u00a0 have from the depositor to make use of the goods deposited.\u00a0 (Civil Code, 1768, and Code of Commerce, 309.)<\/p><p>But in the present case neither was there authorization of the depositor nor did the depositaries intend to make use of the rice for their own consumption of profit; they were merely released from\u00a0 the obligation oi returning the same thing and contracted in lieu thereof the obligation of delivering something similar to the half of it, being bound by no fixed terms, the opposite of what happens in a mutual loan, to make the delivery or return when and how it might please the depositor.<\/p><p>In fact, it has happened that the\u00a0 depositaries have, with the consent of the depositor, as provided in article 309 of the Code of Commerce,\u00a0 disposed\u00a0 of the paddy \"for transactions he intrusted to them,\" and that in lieu of the deposit there has been a hire\u00a0 of\u00a0 services, which is the one entered into between the parties\u00a0 to the end that one should return in rice half of the quantity of paddy delivered by the other, with the obligation on the latter's part of paying 10 cen`11times for each\u00a0 cavan\u00a0 of hulled rice.\u00a0\u00a0 The consequence of this is\u00a0 that the rules\u00a0 and regulations for contract of hire of services\u00a0 must\u00a0 be applied to the case,\u00a0 one of which is that the thing\u00a0 must be\u00a0 returned after the operation entrusted and payment of compensation, and the other that the action for claiming the thing leased, being personal, does not prescribe for fifteen years under article 1964 of the Civil Code.<\/p><p>If the action\u00a0 arising from the\u00a0 receipts in question does not prescribe in three years, as does that from bills of exchange, because they are not drafts\u00a0 payable\u00a0 to order or anything but receipts that any warehouseman would sign if the\u00a0 possession of the\u00a0 paddy on the part of those who received it for threshing is not in\u00a0 the capacity of owner but only in that\u00a0 of depositary or\u00a0 lessor of services and under such character ownership thereof could not prescribe in six years, or at any\u00a0 time, because\u00a0\u00a0 lease for recovery of possession that has not been lost but maintained in the lessee in the name of the lessor; if prescription of any kind can\u00a0 in no way be held, only because there could not have been either beginning or end of a fixed period for the prescription, it is useless to talk of interruption of the period for the\u00a0 prescription, to which tends the third assignment of error,\u00a0 wherein it is said that the court violated article 296 of the Code of Civil, Procedure in admitting as\u00a0 proven facts\u00a0 not alleged in\u00a0 the\u00a0 complaint, just as if by admitting them there would have\u00a0 been a finding with\u00a0 regard to the computation of the period for timely exercise of the action, taking into consideration the legal interruptions of the running of the period of prescription. The court has made no finding in the sense that this or that period of time during which these or those facts\u00a0 occurred must be counted out, and therefore the action has not prescribed, because by eliminating such period\u00a0 of time and comparing such and such date the action has been brought in due time.\u00a0 Prescription\u00a0 of three or six years cannot be presupposed in the terms alleged, but only of fifteen years, which is what is proper to oppose to the exercise of a right of action arising from hire of services,and even of deposit or mutual loan, whether common\u00a0 or mercantile; and such is the prescription considered possible by the trial court, in conformity with articles 943 of the Code of\u00a0 Commerce and 1964 of the Civil Code.<\/p><p>The trial judge confined himself to sentencing the defendants to payment of the\u00a0 price of the paddy, ignoring the thing itself, return whereof ought to have been the subject of judgment in the\u00a0 first place, because the thing itself appears\u00a0 to have been extinguished and its price has taken its place.\u00a0 But the assigning of legal\u00a0 interest from November 21, 1905, can have no other ground than the demand made by plaintiff's\u00a0 counsel\u00a0 upon the\u00a0 defendants\u00a0 to settle this matter.\u00a0 Legal interest\u00a0 on\u00a0 delinquent debts can\u00a0 only\u00a0 be owed from the time the principal amount constitutes a clear and certain debt, and in the present case the\u00a0 principal debt has only been clear and certain since the date of the judgment of the lower court; so the\u00a0 legal\u00a0 interest can be owed only since then.<\/p><p>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, except that the legal interest shall be understood to be owed from the date thereof; with the costs\u00a0 of this instance against the appellants.<\/p><p><em>Torres, Mapa, Johnson,<\/em> and\u00a0 <em>Carson, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<\/p><\/div>",

EMILIA RAFOLS ET AL., OPPONENTS AND APPELLEES.\n  <br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>ARELLANO, C.J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\"><p>Agustina  Rafols, of the city of  Cebu,  Island  of  Cebu, applied  for  the entry in  the new land registry, and for the ownership title, of an improved urban property consisting of a lot,  a house of masonry,  a warehouse,  and another house of strong materials, whose possession thereof is recorded in the books of the old registry.<\/p>\n<p>Emilia  Rafols,  Arcadia Rafols, and Angela Rafols, as heirs  designated  in  her  will by  their collateral  relative, Luisa Rafols,  who was the original owner of the said property,  opposed the application for the registration of the same, made by Agustina  Rafols.<\/p>\n<p>The following facts were proved:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li> That Luisa Rafols was  the owner of the said property.<br\/>\n<br\/>\n<\/li>\n<li> That, on June 25, 1869, by a public instrument, Luisa Rafols sold the said land and its  improvements, under a paeto de retracto, or agreement of sale with right to repurchase, to the commercial  firm of Koch &amp; Brunner  (Otto Koch and George Brunner), doing business  in the city of Cebu, for the price of 4,600  pesos, it being stipulated, to quote literally:<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"That the said Dona Luisa may redeem the house and the other buildings sold, with their lots, after the lapse of four years counted from this date, that is, June  24, 1893, and for the same sum of 4,600 pesos, and if,  on  the said date, she does not redeem the  said property, by this mere fact the sale shall be converted into an actual and  perpetual sale, without the need of a new instrument.\"   (Applicant's Exhibit I, 188.)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li> That, by another public instrument of June 12,  1893, the term for the maturity of the said <em>pacto de retracto<\/em> was extended, in the following language:<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"And the term being about to expire during which Dona Luisa may redeem the property sold by virtue of the stipulated agreement, and  as  she has  not the necessary sum wherewith so to do, she states that from the 24th of the present month the said property shall be considered as sold to Messrs. Koch and Brunner,  until the 24th of June, 1897, under the same  conditions and agreement  as  it Is now sold,  and she  adds that, for the purpose of enabling her to carry the instrument of sale and repurchase into effect before the last date above mentioned, she as the redeemer shall  return,  in addition to the price of  4,600 pesos, the expenses of the present instrument; and  if she  should let the said  term elapse without redeeming the  property, the sale shall be  definitely consummated in favor of the purchasers, in which case it shall be sufficient  merely to record this fact in the registry  by means of a  marginal note.\" (Applicant's Exhibit I,196.)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li> That, on July 22,  1894, the said Dona Luisa Rafols solemnly executed her will before the notary public of the district  of  Cebu, wherein she declared that she had  no forced heirs and she named as  her heirs various  collateral relatives (who apparently are seventeen in number at the present time), among them the three opponents, and she appointed  as  her  testamentary  executors  Ignacio  Neis, Francisco Medalle, and Marcos  Alo, whom she vested with the powers of expert partitioners of her  estate and the extensions of time granted  by  law, for  the  fulfillment of the duties  of their office; that,  as guardian for her minor heirs, if any, she appointed Martin Medalle, to serve without bond, and as <em>protutor<\/em>, Gregorio Cabrera; and she forbade all judicial intervention in the matter  of her said will. (Applicant's Exhibit D, 184.)<br\/>\n<br\/>\n<\/li>\n<li> That, at the death of the testatrix, there was no other minor heir than Felix Rafols,  for whose guardianship  a famjly council was held before  the justice of the peace of Cebu, on November 20,  1894, whereby the  following resolutions were  adopted:  (a) To  grant  to the  guardian the authorization he solicited  by motion  of the  testamentary executors of  the deceased  Dona Luisa,  to enable him to proceed to the sale \"of the right which belonged to the said Dona  Luisa to recover  a house built of strong  materials with a tile roof, together with a masonry warehouse, sold under <em>pacto de retro<\/em>  to Messrs. Koch and Brunner;\" the council, upon granting the authorization requested, provided that the sale should be by public auction, after appraisal by  experts, and  the  latter appraised  the  property at 10,000 pesos.  The auction was announced by the Court of First Instance,  on February 15,  1895, on  a  basis  of 10,000 pesos.   (B,  of e., pp. 10, 11);  (b) to grant a new authorization  to  the guardian  in order  that, in  view  of the failure of the auction, he might proceed  to a new appraisal of the property, which  was valued anew  at  5,000 pesos; (c)  to grant a more  ample authorization to enable the selling, jointly  with the said property,  of other  properties of  the estate, such as a house of strong  materials for 300 pesos, another with a nipa roof for 50 pesos, several parcels  of  agricultural  land,  and a mill  for about 800 pesos\u2014all of which in no wise concerns the present case. This authorization was given on March 30, 1895.<br\/>\n<br\/>\n<\/li>\n<li> That neither could this auction be held, on  account of the opposition offered  by the administrator of the convent of  the Santo Nino  of Cebu, to whom the  land  belonged, an  ownership proved  both by the  documents he exhibited and by the recognition and payment of a canon or fee, sometimes by Dona Luisa, sometimes by  Messrs. Koch and Brunner, for the use of  the land; and it was for this reason that the testamentary executors  came to an agreement with the said administrator of the Santo Nino Convent, for the purchase of the lot for the price of 1,100 pesos and for the execution of the instrument of sale by the aforementioned proprietor in behalf  of the  estate  at such time as the repurchase of the property in question should be  effected.  By virtue  of  these stipulations, there  was adopted, as in the previous cases, another resolution by the family council, on June 25, 1895;  (d) granting special authorization to the  protutor  to  enable him  to  give his consent to the  aforesaid contract  (pp. 143 to 146; applicant's  Exhibit  L, 99 to 146); and<br\/>\n<br\/>\n<\/li>\n<li> That, by virtue of this authorization and of the agreement had with  the owner  of the lot, the auction was newly announced for  July 9, 1895, in conformity with the order of the Court of First Instance directing  the announcement of the same, issued on the 2d of the said month and, as therein stated, upon the written motion,  made the day before, the  1st, by the testamentary executors.   (Applicant's Exhibit F.  B. of e., pp. 12 and 13.)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>That this  third auction  took place,  is also  a  fact proven by the testimony of the applicant's two witnesses, Ignacio Neis, the testamentary executor, and Lazaro Osmena, the highest bidder  for  the property at the  said auction,  and by that of the three witnesses for the opponents, Eduardo Lopez,  Emilia Rafols, and Arcadia Rafols.<\/p>\n<p>Neis and Osmena both testified that a third auction was held and,  more positively, Osmena,  who was the  bidder thereat; the latter stated that he had bid in the property, so sold,  at the price of 6,482 pesos\u20146,100 pesos for the larger and 322  pesos  for the  smaller  house\u2014and that delivery was made of 4,640 pesos to Koch &amp; Brunner, who delivered to Osmena the instruments relative to the sale under  <em>pacto de retro.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Of the opponents' witnesses, Eduardo Lopez  positively testified that there was a first, a second and a third auction, the first two  of  which were  ineffective and  the last was protested as null and void because of an excessive  reduction of the price, which is  equivalent  to saying that  it was actually  held.  This witness added that one of the auction sales, he believed it was the third, must  have taken place in March or April,  1895, and that the second of the auction notices (Applicant's Exhibit  F) was that of the second auction.<\/p>\n<p>Emilia Rafols, opponent, testified  that the property in question was  owned by Agustina Rafols, \"because they redeemed it from Koch &amp; Brunner,\" this witness learned from Brunner, and that the only claim which she had made was that which was apparently still pending relative to the executor's accounts, \"accounts of what has taken place, whether  they have  sold the property,  whether there  is any surplus, and whether more property remains, for they have not made any report to us.\"<\/p>\n<p>Arcadia Rafols, opponent, testified that when she arrived at Cebu she was informed that there had been an auction and the property had been transferred to Tomas Osmena, the husband of Agustina  Rafols.  The  only person who stated  that there had  been an auction with bidding and award, was Jose Felix Martinez, justice of the peace, then acting  as a judge of the Court of First Instance.<\/p>\n<p>In the Court of  First Instance of  Cebu there  is at the present time pending a special action, instituted by Emilia Rafols, one of the opponents, in re the estate of Dona Luisa                  Rafols, registered under No. 183, from which the following documentary evidence was taken:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Temporary receipt\u2014For pfs 4640\u2014Cebu, July 22, 1895. Received from Don Tomas Osmena the  sum of four thousand six hundred and  forty  pesos.\u2014(Signed.)  Koch &amp; Brunner.\"   (Applicant's Exhibit  H, 187.)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>From these facts the  following considerations arise:<\/p>\n<p>First. That  if, six years prior to her  decease, Luisa Rafols  sold the property in question to Koch &amp; Brunner, then at the time of her death the house was no longer hers and could not figure among her hereditary assets or in the estate she left  when she  died; such  property  was not a part of her estate, but only the right to repurchase it, valid until June 24, 1897, $nd,  also, this only it was that her heirs could  inherit; from which it is concluded that it may in no  wise be affirmed that the building or the  land belonged to the heirs of Luisa Rafols, for that very reason, to wit, that at  the  latter's death neither of them longer belonged  to  her, nor is  there any  provision whatever in Luisa Rafols' will, with  respect to such  building or to the land, neither of which is  even mentioned  therein.<\/p>\n<p>Second. That the  4,600  pesos received by Luisa Rafols from Koch  &amp; Brunner were '^he price of the sale of the property, and,  at the former's death represented no  debt of any kind of which mention should be made in the will; Luisa  Rafols did not receive them as  a  loan  under the security of a mortgage on her property; had she done so, it might rightly have been said that they were a debt  that she left to her heirs.  After the consummation of that sale, there remained no debt owing by the vendor to the vendees and  nothing that might be construed as  an obligation  was transmitted  to her heirs; what remained  to the vendor and was transmitted to her heirs,  was a right: that of repurchasing the property.<\/p>\n<p>Third. That the title to the said  property, whereby it was  transferred  from Koch &amp; Brunner to Agustina Rafols, was  one acquired by purchase at a judicial public sale for 6,432 pesos;  and although the  record no longer  exists of such transaction, owing to the loss by fire of the records of the Court of First Instance of Cebu, documentary and parol evidence was presented  at the trial to the effect that there were three auctions held for the.sale of the said property, and that evidence is amply sufficient.   The proofs of the first and the second auctions are the minutes of the family council which dealt with the minor Felix Rafols and which is referred to  in  paragraph 5 of this decision, and the applicant's Exhibit E, consisting of the judicial decree of February, 1895, giving notice of the first auction,  as documentary evidence, and the testimony of the opponents' witness, Eduardo Lopez; but the judicial decree, applicant's Exhibit F, is not, as  the latter witness  declared,  proof of the second  auction, for the  guardian could hardly have reported to the family council, on June  22, 1895, that the second auction could not be carried out  on account of the opposition offered by the Santo Nifio Convent of Cebu and the council  have  authorized a third auction, according to its minutes  of June 25 of the  same year, if only on July 2, 1895, the date of  that judicial decree, a second auction was announced,  which was the subject of the  applicant's said Exhibit F.   The truth is that the judicial decree contained in this Exhibit  F was published  to announce a  third auction, which, as stated in the decree, was to take place on the 9th of  the said month  and year.<\/p>\n<p>Fourth. That if, as  positively stated by  Eduardo Lopez, a witness for the opponents, there was a third auction; if, as the opponent Arcadia Rafols testified, she was informed when she arrived at Cebu  that there had been  an auction held and that the property had  been conveyed to Tomas Osmena, the husband  of Agustina Rafols; if,  as testified by Emilia Rafols, the principal opponent, Brunner, of the firm of Koch and Brunner, had told her that the said  spouses Osmena had redeemed the property, and there  appears in the special  proceedings,  initiated by her, a temporary receipt given by Koch and Brunner for the 4,640 pesos involved in the repurchase, said witness adding that the object  of the special proceedings was to have \"the testamentary executors render accounts of what had taken place, whether they had sold the property, whether there was any surplus, and, besides, whether more property remained,\" then, it is evident that Agustina Rafols acquired the property in question  at  a  public  sale by auction, and  this is what it  is endeavored to prove.<\/p>\n<p>Fifth. That it is not admissible to affirm that the requisites of the auction sale were not complied with, when it is not stated which of them is lacking, especially when the presumption \"that the law has been obeyed\" is a presumption  of law  (Code of Civ. Pro., subsec.  31, sec. 334);  it must, therefore, be presumed that approval was had of the auction,  if such be the requisite that appears to be lacking; moreover, under the  Civil Code,  which was in full force in 1895 (without having been  suspended in this respect,  as erroneously believed  by a witness),  it was not necessary that either the auction sale or its approval should be judicial acts, inasmuch as it devolved upon the family council to authorize and approve the sale, in accordance with articles 269, cases 5 and  7, and 272 of the said code; so that, there being no reason for the  Court  of First  Instance now to approve that sale held in  1895, it would not be just to subject to such a requisite, not prescribed by law, the exercise of an absolute and unconditional right,  now a vested one, which the  applicant  has  to regard herself as  the selling-owner of the property since  1895, when she  acquired  it, and since which  time she has been holding it without the least  opposition or difficulty, until October 11, 1907, the date of her application whereby alone these questions have been raised; nor would it likewise be just to make dependent on the rendition  and approval of the accounts of the testamentary executor, Ignacio Neis, nor on any other liability of the executorship of the estate of Luisa Rafols, the registration of the property in  question, which latter, in no case and for no reason whatever may be  affected by liabilities of any kind of the said estate, because,  even prior to the testamentary execution, and by an act inter vivos not impugned nor attempted to  be impugned,  the said property ceased  to  belong to the  predecessor  in interest  of  the estate.<\/p>\n<p>Sixth. That, even  supposing for a  moment that there had been no third auction, and that the applicant had not acquired the property by means of this title of acquisition, yet there would always remain the fact, hereinabove stated, shown by the record to have been fully proved, to wit, that on July 22, 1895, Koch &amp; Brunner, the owners of the property at that time, had received from Tomas Osmena, the husband of Agustina Rafols, the 4,640 pesos, the price of the sale of the said property to these spouses, or the price for which  the latter \"had  redeemed it,\" according to a phrase used by Emilia Rafols; by reason of this fact, all the rights of Koch &amp; Brunner were transferred to the said spouses,  and one of the rights  of Koch  &amp; Brunner was that if, on the  24th  of June, 1897,  the right of repurchase stipulated in the instrument of June 12, 1893, had not been exercised, the sale should  be finally consummated; wherefore,  as the property was  not  repurchased, the sale  to the Osmena spouses became finally consummated on June 25, 1897.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"If the vendor should  not  comply with the provisions of article 1518 (concerning  redemption), the  vendee shall irrevocably acquire  the ownership  of the  thing  sold.\" (Civil Code, art. 1509.)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>It is a conclusion of the judgment appealed from \"that she (the applicant) repurchased the property from Messrs. Koch &amp; Brunner and has an interest therein.\"  (B. of e., p. 20.)<\/p>\n<p>And, finally,  just as Koch &amp; Brunner might have, since July 25, 1897, applied for1  the registration of their title of absolute and full ownership to the property in question and for the issuance to them of an owner's title, pursuant to the new Land  Registration  Act,  so  also could  Agustina Rafols, from the said date,  obtain, and she can now obtain, the same rights, for identical reasons,  to  wit: because of the consolidation of the ownership and because the title of sale under right of  redemption  is converted into one of definite  and final sale, which is a perfectly adequate title for the transfer of ownership and all other real rights in the thing sold.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, the judgment appealed from is reversed, and the Court of Land Registration shall order the registration and issuance of title applied for by Agustina Rafols, as well as the cancellation of the instruments of sale under right of redemption, executed by Luisa Rafols and mentioned in the record, especially of that  of June 25, 1889.  No special assessment of costs is made  in this instance.   So ordered.<\/p>\n<p><em>Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson, Moreland,<\/em> and <em>Trent, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<br\/>\n<\/p>\n<\/div>",

Pending the proceedings in this court, Reogiion withdrew his appeal and the only question now presented for our consideration is the appeal of Paulino Dingle.<\/p>\n<p>We are of opinion that the evidence of record fully sustains the  contention of the prosecution in this case and the findings of the  lower court as to the facts.  The learned trial judge went very minutely into the evidence  and we are in entire accord with his findings of fact; we shall not, therefore, review the evidence in detail.<\/p>\n<p>It appears that on the night of October 5, 1910, the two defendants in this case went to the house of one Gregorio Ballesteros, a resident of the village of  Natividad, district of San Jose de Barangobong, of the Province of Pangasinan, and  that Luis Reogiion entered the house, cut the throat of Gregorio  Ballesteros with a bolo, almost severing the head from the body at one stroke, whilst his codefendant Paulino Dingle  remained outside on  guard at the window with  a drawn <em>bolo<\/em>; and that their victim  died soon thereafter and was  unable to speak or show any material sign  of  consciousness.<\/p>\n<p>The trial judge, upon proof of these facts, held the defendant Paulino  Dingle guilty as  an accomplice.  We  are of opinion,  however, that  he should have  been convicted as a  principal.<\/p>\n<p>Principals, under the  definition of article 13 of the Penal Code, are those (1) who take a direct part in  the commission of the act; (2) those who directly force or induce others to commit it; and (3)  those who cooperate in the commission of the act by another, and without which it would not have been accomplished.   We have frequently held that under this definition  one who aids and abets in the commission of  a crime by  standing guard while others actually  commit it, is guilty as a principal.<\/p>\n<p>In standing guard to keep others away, or to warn  his companion and fellow-conspirator  of danger of discovery, the  accused took \"a direct part in the commission of the       crime.\"  The fact that he was standing at the window, outside the house, rather than inside, does not change his essential relation  to the commission of the crime, and to his codefendant who  was guilty of the specific material act which resulted in the death of their victim.  He was in fact present, aiding and abetting in the commission of the crime.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"One who shares the guilty purpose and encourages and abets the crime by his presence at the time of its perpetration is guilty as principal even though  he may have  taken no part in its material execution.\"   (U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Santos et al, 2 Phil. Rep., 453.)<\/p>\n<p>\"Where it appears that the defendants, after conspiring together to kill the deceased, went to his house for the purpose of carrying out their common intent and prepared to cooperate to that end,  and some of them actually killed the deceased,  while  the others posted themselves around  the building ready to prevent  his  escape  or render any assistance which might be necessary, all will be held equalljr guilty as principals, irrespective of the individual participation of each in the material act of the murder.\"  (U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Bundal et al, 3 Phil. Rep., 89.)<\/p>\n<p>\"When the object of the crime is robbery, for the execution of which the defendants prepared themselves and began with the killing  of the victim, all are principals and  liable for the consequence of the unlawful  acts committed by any one of them, even though some of them have  not actually participated in the execution thereof,  where  it is shown that they have agreed upon and planned the crime of robbery,  were present intentionally when the overt acts were committed,  accompanied the actual  executor of the crime to the place where said crime was  to  be carried out, cooperated in  the consummation of the crime, and, finally, participated in the distribution of the effects robbed.\"  (U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Santos et al, 4 Phil. Rep., 189.)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>We are of opinion, therefore, that the judgment of conviction  of the defendant Paulino Dingle as an accomplice, and the penalty imposed upon him should be reversed, and we find the said Paulino  Dingle guilty as principal  of the crime of assassination with which he was charged, with the aggravating circumstances that  the crime was  committed at night, and in the house of the offended person, and the extenuating circumstance  set  forth in article  11  of the Penal Code.  We, therefore,  impose upon the said Paulino Dingle the penalty of <em>cadena  perpetua<\/em>  (life imprisonment), together with the accessory penalties prescribed by article 54 of the Penal Code, the payment of  one-half of the costs of these proceedings, and jointly and severally with his codefendant Luis Reogilon the  indemnification of the heirs of the deceased, Gregorio Ballesteros, in the sum of P1,000.

This precise question was definitely settled in the case of the Compaiiia General  de Tabacos <em>vs.<\/em> Martinez, reported  in  17 Phil. Rep.,  160.  Following the doctrine  laid down in that case we hold that the judgment in the case at bar having been  entered before the new Code of Civil Procedure (Act No. 190) went into effect (Oct. 1, 1901), and more than five years having elapsed from that date until the date of the issuance of the writ of execution, the court below had no jurisdiction in the premises, and the writ was therefore invalid ab initio, having been issued improvidently and without lawful authority.   (Sees. 38, 443, and 447,  Code of Civil Procedure.)<\/p>\n<p>The proceedings had  in this court in bringing the questions involved to an issue were somewhat irregular.  We have heretofore directed that  the proceedings respectively entered under register numbers  6599 and 7089 be consolidated and heard together, since they are in fact a single case; that is to say, the appeal brought here on a bill of exceptions bearing register number 7089, of which the application for a preliminary injunction bearing register number 6599 is  a mere incident.  They ought to have been treated originally as a single case and registered under the same title and number,  paying but a single filing fee in the clerk's office of this court.  The confusion seems to have arisen as a result of the fact that although the application for a preliminary injunction was submitted to this court after the appeal in the case of which it is an incident had been perfected in the court below, it was filed in the clerk's  office of this court pending the proceedings in the court below for the preparation, approval  and transmission of the bill of exceptions to this court.<\/p>\n<p>Notwithstanding resultant irregularities in the proceedings had in this court, we think that both parties have had full  opportunity  to be  heard upon the real questions at issue, and that the whole  case may fairly  be taken as at issue and submitted for final adjudication.<\/p>\n<p>Twenty days hereafter let judgment be entered reversing the decree of the Court of First Instance of Manila dated November 19, 1910, whereby that court declined to suspend the proceedings then pending upon the invalid and  improvidently issued writ of execution, without special condemnation of costs in this instance; and ten days thereafter let the record be returned to the court wherein it originated, where a new order will issue having due  regard to the rules laid down in the case of Compania General de Tabacos <em>vs.<\/em> Martinez (17 Phil.

EDUARDO DE ROTAECHE, ATTORNEY IN FACT OF ANGEL ORTIZ, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>JOHNSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">On the 4th of August, 1909, the plaintiff commenced the present action in the Court of First Instance of the Province of Sorsogon, for the purpose of recovering the sum of P9,687.86, as damages occasioned by the defendant to\", the plaintiff, caused by an illegal execution and sale of the property of the plaintiff by the defendant.<br\/><br\/>On the 24th of August, 1909, the defendant filed a demurrer to said complaint, alleging that the facts therein stated were insufficient to constitute a cause of action and were vague and unintelligible, which demurrer was, on the 6th of November, 1909, overruled; whereupon the defendant filed a general denial.<br\/><br\/>After hearing the evidence, the Honorable Jose C. Abreu, judge, on the 22d of April, 1910, rendered a judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant, for the sum of P3,707.26, with legal interest from the date of the commencement of the present action. From that judgment the defendant appealed and made the following assignments of error:<br\/><blockquote>\"I. The court erred in declaring that the agreement of November 29, 1904, entered into between Andres Zapanta as one party and Ramon Echevarria, attorney in fact for F. Suarez, as the other party, which is attached hereto as Exhibit A of the complaint, has rendered null and void the judgment pronounced in civil case No. 56 of the Court of First Instance of Sorsogon, wherein the commercial firm 'Viuda e Hijos de F. Suarez' was the plaintiff and Andres Zapanta the defendant, and that by virtue of said agreement the said firm renounced execution by legal means of the judgment rendered in its favor, stipulating that in case of nonfulfillment of said agreement on the part of Andres Zapanta, said commercial firm would have to proceed again to a new civil trial in order to enforce payment of the said judgment.<br\/><br\/>\"II. The court erred in rendering judgment against Don Angel Ortiz.<br\/><br\/>\"III. The court erred in not granting the new trial requested by the attorney for Angel Ortiz, in accordance with law, and especially for the reason that the facts held in the judgment were not sufficiently justified by the evidence.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>With reference to the first assignment of error above noted, the following facts appear to be undisputed:<br\/><br\/>First. That on the 22d of August, 1904, Ramon Echevarria, as legal representative of the firm, \"Viuda e Hijos de F. Suarez,\" commenced an action in the Court of First Instance of the Province of Sorsogon, against the plaintiff herein (Andres Zapanta) for the purpose of recovering the sum of 7,179.48 pesos Mexican currency.<br\/><br\/>Second. That on the 25th of October, 1904, after the trial of said cause, the said court rendered a judgment in favor of\u00a0 the plaintiff and against the said defendant (Andres Zapanta), for the said sum of 7,179.48 pesos Mexican currency; that said sum of 7,179.48 pesos Mexican currency reduced to Conant equaled the sum of P6,353.52.<br\/><br\/>Third. That on the 29th of November, 1904, the plaintiff herein and the defendant entered into the following agreement or contract with reference to the said judgment for the sum of 7,179.48 pesos Mexican currency (P6,353.52):<br\/><blockquote>\"I, Andres Zapanta, married, of legal age, and resident of Sorsogon, capital of the Province of Sorsogon, Philip-pine Islands, make known by these presents:<br\/><br\/>\"First. That I am indebted, and so acknowledge, to the commercial firm 'Viuda e Hijos de F. Suarez,' in the sum of six thousand three hundred fifty-three pesos and fifty-two centavos (P6,353.52), as declared in the judgment rendered in civil suit No. 56, filed in the Court of First Instance of this province by the representative of said firm.<br\/><br\/>\"Second. That as I am unable to pay said amount now in a lump sum, I promise to pay at the end of each month to the said commercial firm 'Viuda e Hijos de F. Suarez,' the sum of one hundred fifty pesos (P150), which payment shall be made for the first time at the end of the present month.<br\/><br\/>\"Third. That the sum owed and acknowledged shall bear interest at the rate of three per centum per annum, which shall diminish in relative proportion with the amount that will each month be paid by me on account.<br\/><br\/>\"I, Ramon Echevarria, as representative of the firm called 'Viuda e Hijos de F. Suarez,' of Sorsogon, accept the propositions above set forth by Andres Zapanta, with the proviso that in case of nonfulfillment of his promise, said commercial firm shall be at liberty to enter suit against him.<br\/><br\/>\"In witness whereof, we sign the present instrument in Sorsogon, this 29th of November, 1904.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: right;\">\"VIUDA E HIJOS DE F. SUAREZ.<br\/>(Sgd.\u00a0 by power of attorney.) <br\/>\"R. ECHEVARRIA. <br\/>(Sgd.)\u00a0 \"ANDRES ZAPANTA.\"<br\/><\/div><\/blockquote>Fourth. That under and by virtue of said agreement mentioned in the foregoing paragraph, the plaintiff (Zapanta), continued to make payments until he had paid the sum of P3,699.37, leaving a balance due on the 31st of March, 1909, of the sum of P2,939.79. (See Exhibit No. 1.)<br\/><br\/>Fifth. That by reason of the failure of the plaintiff to punctually comply with the provisions of said agreement, the defendant herein, on the 31st of March, 1909, sued out a writ of execution for the purpose of recovering the balance due upon said judgment of 7,179.48 pesos Mexican currency; that by virtue of said execution, the sheriff of the Province of Sorsogon attached and sold practically all of the property which the plaintiff had in said province, amounting in value to P3,707.26.<br\/><br\/>Under these facts, in relation with the said first assignment of error, we have the questions presented:<br\/><br\/>(a) What was the effect of said agreement mentioned in said paragraph 3, upon the judgment of the court rendered on the 25th of October, 1904, for the sum of 7,179.48 pesos Mexican currency?<br\/><br\/>(b) Did said agreement have the effect of merging the said judgment? and<br\/><br\/>(c) Did the defendant, for a failure to comply with the said agreement, have a right to an execution under said judgment?<br\/><br\/>The contention of the plaintiff, which was sustained by the lower court is, that that provision of the agreement quoted in paragraph 3 above, \"said commercial firm shall be at liberty to enter suit against him,\" had the effect of extinguishing the rights of the defendant in the said judgment of the 25th of October, 1904; in other words, that by virtue of said agreement, all of the rights and obligations of the respective parties to said judgment had been merged in said agreement; that if the plaintiff should fail to comply with the conditions of said agreement, the only remedy of the defendant was to commence an action against him upon said contract; that the defendant, by virtue of said agreement, had lost his right to a writ of execution under said judgment (October 25, 1904).<br\/><br\/>A final judgment is one of the most solemn obligations incurred by parties known to the law. The Civil Code, in article 1156, provides the method by which all civil obligations may be extinguished. One of the methods recognized by said code for the extinguishment of obligations is that by novation. (Civil Code, arts. 1156, 1203 to 1213.) In order, however, that an obligation shall be extinguished by another obligation (by novation) which substitutes it, the law requires that the novation or extinguishment shall be expressly declared or that the old and new obligations shall be absolutely incompatible. (Civil Code, art. 1204.) In the present case, the contract referred to does not expressly extinguish the obligations existing in said judgment. Upon the contrary it expressly recognizes the obligations existing between the parties in said judgment and expressly provides a method by which the same shall be extinguished, which method is, as is expressly indicated in said contract, by monthly payments. The contract, instead of containing provisions \"absolutely incompatible\" with the obligations of the judgment, expressly ratifies such obligations and contains provisions for satisfying them. The said agreement simply gave the plaintiff <i>a method and more time<\/i> for the satisfaction of said judgment. It did not extinguish the obligations contained in the judgment, until Hie terms of said contract had been fully complied with. Had the plaintiff continued to comply with the conditions of said contract, he might have successfully invoked its provisions against the issuance of an execution upon the said judgment. The contract and the punctual compliance with its terms only delayed the right of the defendant to an execution upon the judgment. The judgment was not satisfied and the obligations existing thereunder still subsisted until the terms of the agreement had been fully complied with. The Plaintiff was bound to perform the conditions mentioned in contract punctually and fully, in default of which the defendant was remitted to the original rights under his judgment.<br\/><br\/>The contract was not a new and independent obligation expressly extinguishing the judgment; neither were its terms incompatible with the obligations of the judgment. It was simply another method of satisfying the judgment. The judgment was not extinguished. Its enforcement by the methods provided for by law was only delayed during a strict compliance with the terms of the contract. (Ives vs. Phelps, 16 Minn., 407; Brown vs. Feeter, 7 Wendell (N. Y.), 301; Plunkett vs. Block, 117 Ind., 14; Terrett vs. Brooklyn Improvement Co., 87 N. Y., 92; Maute vs. Gross, 56 Pa. St., 250; 94 Am. Dec, 62.)<br\/><br\/>Between the civil and common law, with reference to the extinguishment of one obligation by the creation of another, there seems to be no difference. Under both systems of jurisprudence, in order to extinguish one obligation by the creation of another, the extinguishment must be made to clearly appear. In our opinion, in the present case the new contract did not expressly extinguish the obligations of the judgment, neither are the terms of said contract \"absolutely incompatible\" with the obligations of said judgment.<br\/><br\/>Under the view which we have taken of the first assignment of error, we deem it unnecessary to discuss the second and third assignments of error.<br\/><br\/>Our conclusion is, therefore, that when the plaintiff failed to comply with the conditions of said contract, the defendant had a right to resort to the methods provided by law for the satisfaction of the obligations created by said judgment.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the lower court is therefore hereby reversed, and the defendant is hereby released from any obligation under the complaint, and without any finding as to costs, it is so ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Moreland<\/i>, and <i>Trent, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<\/div>",

The State\u00a0 (96 Miss., 377), the court that:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"In vagrancy,\u00a0 the offense consists in general worthlessness ; that i in being idle, and, though able to work, refusing to do so, and living without labor, <em>or on the charity of others<\/em>.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>This\u00a0 definition of the offense substantially\u00a0 corresponds with the d of that class of vagrancy\u00a0 set forth in the first part\u00a0 of\u00a0 section 1 the Philippine\u00a0 Vagrancy Act (Act No. 519), which provides that:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"Every person having no apparent means of subsistence, who has the physical ability to work, and who neglects to apply himself or herself some lawful calling\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 * is a vagrant.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>We do not think that the claim by this able-bodied man, 33 years of age, that\u00a0 he was living on the charity of his mother, can be said to rebut the other\u00a0 evidence\u00a0 in the record which\u00a0 tended to disclose\u00a0 that he\u00a0 had no apparent means of support. He had no legal or moral claim upon his mother for support, and indeed, from the indications i record as to the scanty means possessed by the mother, it would appeal that it was his\u00a0 filial\u00a0 duty\u00a0 to aid her rather than to call upon he aid.<\/p><p>In the case of People <em>vs.<\/em> Herrick\u00a0 (59\u00a0 Mich., 563), the court construing the words \"visible means\u00a0 of support\" held that the\u00a0 use o word indicates that\u00a0 appearances must to some extent be relied upon; and that the words \"visible\" and\u00a0 \"apparent\" were words\u00a0 of similar purport and meaning.\u00a0\u00a0 Anderson's Law Dictionary defines the word \"apparent\" as follows: \"Readily seen; evident; self-evident; manifest<\/p><p>We are of opinion that one who makes no\u00a0 pretense\u00a0 to follow any lawful calling or\u00a0 occupation, who makes no effort to support himself whose\u00a0 time is spent\u00a0 in\u00a0 loitering and wandering about the streets a frequenting cockpits and other places where gambling is carried on, c be said to have any apparent,\u00a0 visible, self-evident or manifest mean support, despite his\u00a0 claim\u00a0 that\u00a0 he is living upon the charity\u00a0 of mother, when it\u00a0 appears that\u00a0 he has no claim either legal\u00a0 or moral upon her. for support, and that his mother's\u00a0 limited means would just the expectation that she would receive assistance from her son rather than\u00a0 render assistance to him.<\/p><p>The judgment of conviction\u00a0 and the sentence imposed by the trial\u00a0 co should be and are hereby affirmed, with the costs of this instance against\u00a0 the appellant.<\/p><p><em>Arellano, C.

Damasa Laforga was not the legal representative of the said minors at the time of the execution of that agreement and she evidently acted merely as their grandmother.  Even supposing that she might then have been acting as the guardian ad litem of  said minors, which is  the most that could be admitted from the  evidence adduced  at the trial,  such capacity  could  not authorize her  validly to execute  the agreement  concerned,  which,  therefore,  lacks  the  legal force requisite to make it binding upon  the  minors.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment appealed from is reversed, in so far as it declares that the plaintiff minors must pay the sum of P203 to the  defendant, and the latter is ordered  to deliver immediately to them the  disputed Lubec land, but the right is reserved to the defendant to prosecute his  claim for said payment against Damasa Laforga in the manner and form provided by  law.

It was claimed that the purpose of the building was to  serve as a  guard house in which watchmen might be stationed in  order  to prevent the carrying away of <em>zacate<\/em> from the premises.   The permit was denied by the city authorities on the grouncj that the site of the  proposed building did not  conform to the requirements  of  section 107  of the Revised Ordinances  of the city of Manila, as amended by Ordinance No. 124,  which provides:  \"That  the building shall  abut  or face upon  a public street or alley or on a private street or alley  which has been officially approved.\"   It is the contention of the appellees herein that this provision  is unconstitutional and in violation of the fundamental rights of the property owners of the city of Manila as guaranteed by the established laws of these Islands and by the Constitution of the United States, in that it constitutes an invasion  of their property rights without due process of law.  The lower court found in favor of appellees and  declared the ordinance null and void, at least to the extent of the above-cited provision.   From this judgment this  appeal has been duly perfected.  The only question submitted for adjudication  on this appeal is the constitutionality of the ordinance, and to this question alone we direct our attention in this opinion.<\/p>\n<p>The appellant,  the city of  Manila, is a duly  organized municipal corporation having full power and authority to enact lawful ordinances for the protection and security of the lives, health and property of its citizens.   Counsel for appellant insists that the ordinance in question  is a valid    exercise of the police power  of  the  city, in  that its sole purpose and aim is to effect these ends by affording better sanitary regulations as well as increased facilities for protection to property from loss by fire.<\/p>\n<p>It  is undoubtedly one of the fundamental duties of the city of Manila to make all reasonable regulations looking to the preservation .and  security  of  the general health of the community, and the protection  of life and property from loss or destruction by fire.   All such regulations have their sanction in what is termed the police power.  Much difficulty has been  experienced by the courts and text  writers in the attempt to define the police power of the state, and to set forth its precise limitations. In fact it has been said to be, from its very nature  incapable of any exact definition or limitation.   Mr. Thompson in his exhaustive treatise on Corporations summarizes as follows the conclusions of the leading adjudicated cases and authorities touching this subject.  He says:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Its business is to  regulate  and protect the security  of social order, the life and health of the citizen, the comfort of an existence in thickly populated communities, the enjoyment of private and  social life, and  the  beneficial use  of property.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>And again the same author says:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"However courts may differ as to the extent and boundaries of this power, and however difficult it may be of precise definition, there is a general agreement that it extends.to the protection of the lives, health and property of the citizens, and to the preservation of good order and  the public morals. In the absence of any constitutional prohibition a legislature may  lawfully prevent all things hurtful to the  comfort, safety, and welfare of society though the prohibition invades the right of liberty or property  of an individual.\"   (Thompson on Corporations, 2d ed., vol. 1, sec. 421.)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>In the case of U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Toribio (15 Phil. Rep., 92) we had occasion to discuss at length the  police powers of the State, and in the opinion in that case will be found a number of quotations from textbook and judicial authority, developing and exemplifying the principles on which the exercise of the police powers of the State have been recognized and applied.  But for the purposes of this opinion the foregoing citations from  Thompson's treatise on Corporations sets forth the doctrine quite  satisfactorily,  and relying on  the reasoning of the opinion in the case of U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Toribio  (15 Phil. Rep., 92),  it is not necessary to enter at this time into an extended discussion of the principles on which the doctrine rests.<\/p>\n<p>In accord with the rule laid down in  the case of Lawton <em>vs.<\/em>  Steele  (152  U. S., 132-134), quoted at  some length in the opinion in the case of U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Toribio, to justify  the State in the exercise of its police powers on behalf of  the public, it must appear:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"First, that the interests of the public generally, as distinguished from those of a particular  class,  require such interference;  and, second,  that the  means  are reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of the purpose, and not unduly  oppressive upon individuals.  The  legislature may not,  under  the  guise of  protecting the  public interests, arbitrarily interfere with private business, or impose unusual and unnecessary restrictions upon  lawful occupations. In other words, its determination as to what is a proper exercise of its police  powers is not final or conclusive, but is subject to the supervision of the courts.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>It is  very clear that the ordinance, if it be  held to be reasonable, prescribes a rule in the interest of the public of the city of Manila  generally,  as  distinguished from the interests of individuals or of a particular class.  In determining its validity, therefore, the only questions which need be considered, are whether its provisions  are or are not reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of its purposes, and  whether they are or  are not unduly oppressive  upon individuals.<\/p>\n<p>The purpose and object of the ordinance is avowedly and manifestly to protect and secure the health, lives and property of the citizens of Manila against the ravages of fire and disease.   The provision  that denies  permits for the construction of buildings within the city  limits unless they \"abut or face upon a public street or alley or on a private street or alley which has been officially approved,\" is in our opinion reasonably necessary to secure the end in view.<\/p>\n<p>In  the first place it prevents the huddling and crowding of buildings in irregular masses on single or adjoining tracts of land, and secures an air space on at least one side of each new residence or other building constructed in the city.  The menace to the health and safety of the residents of Manila resulting from the crowding of nipa shacks, and even more substantial buildings upon small tracts of land is a matter of common knowledge; and in a community,  exposed as this city is to destructive conflagrations and epidemic diseases, a legislative measure which tends to prevent the repetition of such unfortunate conditions should not be judicially declared to be  unreasonable, in the absence of the most compelling reasons.<\/p>\n<p>In  the  second place, the provisions of the ordinance in question manifestly promote the safety and security of the citizens of Manila and of their property  against fire and disease, especially epidemic disease, by securing the easy and unimpeded approach to  all  new  buildings: First, of  fire engines, and other apparatus  for fighting  fire; second, of ambulances, refuse wagons, and apparatus used by the san- itary  department in caring for the sanitation of the city; third, of fire and health  inspectors generally; of employees of the fire department and others engaged  in fighting fire; and of employees of the  Bureau of Health engaged in their duty  as guardians of  the  sanitary conditions and general health of the city.<\/p>\n<p>There can  be  no question as to  the intent and purpose of the provision of the ordinance under  discussion.  It is manifestly intended to subserve the public health and safety of the citizens of Manila generally, and  was not conceived in favor of any class  or of  particular individuals.  Those charged  with the public welfare and  safety of  the city deemed the enactment of the ordinance necessary to secure these purposes, and it cannot be doubted that if its enactment was reasonably necessary to that end it was and is a due and proper exercise of the police power.   We are  of opinion that the enforcement of its provisions cannot fail to redound to the public good, and that it should be sustained on the principle  that \"the welfare of the  people is the highest law\" (<em>salus populi suprema est lex<\/em>).  Indeed having in mind the controlling public necessity which demands the adoption of proper measures to secure the ends sought to be attained by the enactment of this provision of the ordinance; and the large discretion necessarily vested in the legislative authority to determine not only what the interests of the public require, but  what measures are necessary for the protection of such interests; we are satisfied that we would not  be justified, in  an  attempt to restrict or  control the exercise of that discretion even if the \"reasonable necessity\" for  its exercise in  the  particular  form actually adopted were much less apparent than it  is in this case.<\/p>\n<p>That the ordinance  is  not \"unduly oppressive upon individuals\" becomes very clear when the nature and extent of the limitations imposed  by its  provisions upon  the use of private property are considered with relation to the public interests, the public health and safety, which  the ordinance seeks to secure. Discussing this question in his opinion to the Municipal Board relative to the validity  and constitutionality of this ordinance, the Attorney-General well said: \"Under the ordinance before us rights in private property are not arbitrarily regulated. No person desiring to erect a building is prohibited from doing so.   He can, if necessary, lay out a private street or the city can extend the public street system.  The property may thus be substantially increased in value  rather  than the  reverse.   In brief, the owner's right to the enjoyment of his property is only interfered with in so far as it is necessary to protect the rights of others.\"<\/p>\n<p>To this  we  may  add  the following citation from  the opinion in the case of Commonwealth vs. Alger (7 Cush., 53, 84) which to our minds well states the principle in this regard on which the validity of the ordinance in question must be sustained:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"We think it is a settled  principle, growing out of the nature of well ordered civil society, that every holder of property, however absolute and unqualified may be his title, holds it under the implied liability that his use of it may be so regulated that it shall not be injurious to the equal enjoyment of others haying an  equal right to the enjoyment of their property, nor injurious to the rights of the community. *   *  *  Rights of property, like all other social and conventional rights, are subject  to such reasonable limitations in their enjoyment as shall  prevent them from being injurious,  and to such reasonable restraints and regulations established by law, as the legislature, under the governing and controlling  power vested in them by the constitution, may think necessary and expedient.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>We conclude that the proviso of the ordinance in question directing: \"That  the  building shall abut or face upon a public street or alley or on a private street or alley which has  been officially approved,\" is valid,  and that the judgment of the lower court should be  reversed, without special condemnation of costs.  So ordered.<\/p>\n<p><em>Torres, Johnson, Moreland,<\/em> and <em>Trent, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<\/p>\n<\/div>",

Notwithstanding the opposition made by the spouses, Lorenza Sombillo and Hipolito de Jesus\", the judge, on July 30, 1908, overruled, their objections and decreed that the said will be admitted, with the costs against the opponents, and\u00a0 appointed the\u00a0 said Florentino Adriano as the administrator of the estate of the deceased testatrix, holding that there were\u00a0 no legal grounds\u00a0 to order his removal\u00a0 as the special\u00a0 administrator of the said estate appointed by the court.\u00a0\u00a0 A copy of\u00a0 this judgment appears on pages\u00a0 15 to 23 of the record of the said proceedings.<\/p><p>Subsequently, on February 27, 1909, counsel for Lorenza Sombillo filed a written motion with that court, and in the same probate proceedings in the matter of the will of the deceased Carreon, praying that\u00a0 his client be held to be an heiress, by forge of law, of the said deceased and entitled to two-thirds of the estate left by her at her\u00a0 death, as his client's\u00a0 legal portion, in\u00a0 accordance\u00a0 with article 808 of the Civil\u00a0 Code.\u00a0\u00a0 Said\u00a0 counsel alleged that Lorenza Sombillo, married\u00a0 to\u00a0 Hipolito\u00a0 de Jesus,\u00a0 was the\u00a0 legitimate daughter of Magdalena Carreon and that the latter was not survived by\u00a0 any other daughter than the petitioner, Lorenza Sombillo.<\/p><p>By order of March 31\u00a0 of the same year, the motion presented by counsel for Lorenza Sombillo was granted and the beginning of the next term of court was set for the hearing thereon, in order that the parties might bring forward their evidence in those proceedings to prove whether or not Lorenza Sombillo was in fact the\u00a0 legitimate daughter, and consequently the heiress by\u00a0 force of law, of\u00a0 Magdalena Carreon.\u00a0\u00a0 An\u00a0 exception to this\u00a0 order was\u00a0 taken\u00a0 by the administrator,\u00a0 Adriano.<\/p><p>Evidence having been adduced by both parties, the judge, by order of March 26,1910, ruled that there weremo grounds for declaring Lorenza Sombillo to be the legitimate daughter of Magdalena Carreon, and that the petitioner, therefore, was not entitled to any of the estate left by the said deceased. An appeal from this ruling was taken by counsel for Lorenza Sombillo.\u00a0 A certified copy of such of the proceedings and exhibits as was deemed necessary for the purposes of the appeal having been forwarded, the case was,\u00a0 in accordance with law, brought up before this court.<\/p><p>This suit concerns the.'filiation of the appellant, Lorenza Sombillo Ignacio, a woman about forty years old, the wife of Hipolito de Jesus.\u00a0\u00a0 She seeks to be declared the legal heir of the deceased Magdalena Carreon and'entitled to two-thirds of the estate left by the latter at her\u00a0 death, on the ground that she is the deceased's legitimate daughter.\u00a0 In proof of. this .allegation\u00a0 she exhibited a certified copy of her certificate of baptism, issued on March 11, 1906, which document sets forth that the appellant, born the day before, was\u00a0 baptized in the parish\u00a0 of the pueblo of Paombong, Bulacan, on August 10, 1870, that she was the legitimate daughter, born\u00a0 in lawful wedlock, of Tranquilino Sombillo Ignacio\u00a0 and Magdalena Carreon,\u00a0 and that her godmother was Eugenia\u00a0 Carreon.<\/p><p>In order to obtain a successful issue of the claim made by the appellant, Lorenza\u00a0 Sombillo, it\u00a0 is necessary\u00a0 that there should\u00a0 have\u00a0 been\u00a0 presented at trial\u00a0 some of the several kinds of proof of\u00a0 her filiation\u00a0 as the\u00a0 legitimate daughter of the said spouses,\u00a0 Tranquilino and Magdalena, whose names appear in the aforementioned baptismal certificate, in accordance with the provisions of the following articles of the Civil Code:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"Art. 115.\u00a0 The filiation of legitimate children is proven by the record of the birth,\u00a0 entered in the civil registry, or by an authentic instrument, or a final judgment in the cases referred to in articles 110 to 113 of the preceding chapter.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"Art. 116.\u00a0 In the\u00a0 absence of\u00a0 the documents mentioned in the preceding article, filiation shall be proven by the uninterrupted enjoyment of the status of a legitimate child.<\/p><p>\"Art. 117. In the absence of the record of birth, authentic document, final sentence, or enjoyment of status legitimate filiation\u00a0 may be proven by\u00a0 any means, provided there is a foundation of proof in writing coming from\u00a0 both\u00a0 parents, either jointly or severally.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>As civil registry was\u00a0 never established in these Islands during the former sovereignty, a certified copy of a canonical certificate of baptism constitutes, as a public document, proof of the\u00a0 facts that originated\u00a0 its issue or execution by the parish priest, though it can be impugned and assailed by contrary proof.<\/p><p>The\u00a0 certified copy,\u00a0 Exhibit A, which\u00a0 contains\u00a0 the baptismal\u00a0 certificate of\u00a0 Lorenza Sombillo Ignacio,\u00a0 does\u00a0 not constitute the\u00a0 authentic document specified\u00a0 in the aforesaid articles 115 and 117 wherewith to prove the legitimate filiation\u00a0 of a\u00a0 person.\u00a0 The said\u00a0 sacramental certificate is merely\u00a0 proof\u00a0 of the special\u00a0 act, the only one which\u00a0 the parish priest\u00a0 or the party\u00a0 in charge of the\u00a0 civil\u00a0 registry may attest from personal knowledge as having been performed\u00a0 by himself or\u00a0 in his presence, and no value can be attributed to the mere statements contained in such certificate in\u00a0 their relation\u00a0 to prior and different facts, for the proof of which other separate and specific evidence is indispensable.\u00a0 (Decisions\u00a0 of the supreme court of Spain,\u00a0 of November 25, 1875, and March 28,\u00a0 1896.)<\/p><p>In another\u00a0 decision of the\u00a0 13th of\u00a0 July, 1899, the same high tribunal established the following legal doctrine:<\/p><p>A baptismal certificate, like all\u00a0 documents\u00a0 in\u00a0 general,\u00a0 attests the fact that originated its execution, and\u00a0 the date of the same, to writ, the administration of the sacrament on the day specified, but not to the veracity\u00a0 of the statements made therein respecting the kinsfolk of the person baptized. Though the filiation\u00a0 of legitimate children be proven, as established by article 115 of the Civil Code, by the record of birth entered in the civil registry and which is analogous to the certificates of baptism issued prior to the creation of that civil service,such record is presumptive evidence only, and is susceptible of proof to the contrary, and when,\u00a0 by virtue of that proof, the presumption is overcome, the said article of the Code is not violated.\"<\/p><p>Of the several means of proof authorized by\u00a0 the Code, Lorenza\u00a0 Sombillo chose to\u00a0 rely\u00a0 upon one conducive\u00a0 to prove that she had\u00a0 uninterruptedly enjoyed the status\u00a0 of a legitimate daughter of the said spouses\u00a0 who appear as her legitimate father and mother in the aforementioned baptismal certificate, Exhibit A.<\/p><p>The uninterrupted possession of the status of a legitimate daughter is equivalent to the enjoyment of the consideration, on the part of the public, of a legitimate\u00a0 daughter\u00a0 of the said spouses, by the use of the father's surname and by the treatment which, as a legitimate daughter, she received from her father and mother and\u00a0 from her parents' family, and also by her parents having constantly attended to her support and education; these facts she did not succeed in proving, as held by the\u00a0 trial court in the judgment appealed from.<\/p><p>The results obtained as a whole, the preponderance and weight of the evidence adduced by both parties, evidently and conclusively\u00a0 demonstrate that\u00a0 Lorenza Sombillo,\u00a0 notwithstanding the text of the sacramental certificate, Exhibit A, and the testimony of her witnesses,\u00a0 is not the legitimate daughter of Magdajena Carreon by her husband\u00a0 Tranquilino Sombillo,\u00a0 but the daughter of Toribia\u00a0 Carreon, an unmarried woman\u00a0 and\u00a0 sister\u00a0 of Magdalena,\u00a0 and an\u00a0 unknown father.\u00a0 The trial court so held in the judgment appealed from, after duly weighing the merits of the case\u00a0 as disclosed by the evidence and in accordance with the\u00a0 law.<\/p><p>The\u00a0 aforementioned canonical certificate is conclusive proof only of the baptism administered, in conformity with the rites of the Catholic Church, by the priest who baptized the child, Lorenza Sombillo, but it does not prove the veracity of the declarations and statements contained in the said certificaterthat concern the relationship of the person baptized.\u00a0\u00a0 Such declarations and statements, in order that their truth may be admitted, must indispensably be shown by some of the kinds of proof recognized by law.<\/p><p>The statement contained in the aforementioned certificate, Exhibit A, relative to the parents and to the paternal and maternal grandparents of the baptized child, appears to be negatived by similar statements found in the certified copies of the marriage certificate of the same party, Lorenza Sombillo, and the baptismal certificates of her children, Matias and Guillerma, Exhibits\u00a0 2, 3, and 4.\u00a0 It is stated in the certificate A that the baptized child, Lorenza Sombillo, is the legitimate daughter of Magdalena Carreon and Tranquilino Sombillo, while in the certificates designated as Nos. 2, 3, and 4 it appears that the said Lorenza bears the surname Carreon and not that of Sombillo, and is the natural child of the unmarried woman, Toribia Carreon, and an unknown father.\u00a0\u00a0 So that if some value might be ascribed to the statements contained in the baptismal certificate of Lorenza Sombillo, they are vitiated by other similar ones repeatedly made in\u00a0 other documents of the same\u00a0 kind,\u00a0 executed in different years.<\/p><p>If the\u00a0 statement\u00a0 of relationship,\u00a0 contained\u00a0 in the\u00a0 certificate of marriage of Lorenza Carreon to Hipolito de Jesus, or the statements found in the certificates\u00a0 of baptism of her two children, Matias and Guillerma, were not true, for those of the latter contradict that of the former, the said Lorenza and\u00a0 her husband could have\u00a0 sought the amendment of the text of any of those certificates during the lifetime of Magdalena Carreon and thus established the truth; but they did not do so and waited until the death of the testatrix, Magdalena Carreon, and then\u00a0 claimed the estate on the\u00a0 ground that Lorenza Carreon was her legitimate daughter, as set forth in the latter's baptismal certificate which, according to well-settled juridical\u00a0 principles, is not sufficient proof of the legitimate filiation alleged.<\/p><p>The will, Exhibit 1, inserted on page 4 of the bill of exceptions and executed by Magdalena Carreon on November 5, 1895, before the notary Aguedo Velarde and in the presence of three witnesses, corroborates the result derived from the evidence adduced at trial, to wit, that the claimant, Lorenza Sombillo, was not the daughter of the\u00a0 testatrix, Magdalena Carreon, for the latter stated in the third clause of her will\u00a0 that she had\u00a0 only been married once\u00a0 and with Tranquilino\u00a0 Sombillo e Ygnacio, then deceased, by whom she had had eleven children, all likewise deceased, and that she had no living descendant. If Lorenza Sombillo\u00a0 were really the legitimate daughter of the said testatrix, she would\u00a0 have been\u00a0 mentioned in the\u00a0 will\u00a0 as one\u00a0 of the daughters who was living at the time of its execution, and the testatrix, Magdalena Carreon, would not have expressly declared that she had eleven children by her husband and that all were dead on the\u00a0 date when she made her\u00a0 will.<\/p><p>As\u00a0 Magdalena Carreon in\u00a0 her will devised three rural properties as a legacy to her four sisters, Toribia, Engracia, Eugenia, and Simona, and to her five nephews and nieces, the children of her other\u00a0 sister, Maria, then deceased, it is not-explained how, without moral or legal reason she omitted . from her said will, and not so much as mentioned therein, Lorenza Sombillo, who claims to be her legitimate daughter. If the testatrix did not name her as an heir, as she did her son-in-law, the widower of one of her deceased daughters, it was because it was unquestionably\u00a0 true that all her eleven children were then deceased, that none of them were alive on the date she executed her last will and testament, and that\u00a0 Lorenza Sombillo was not, and is not, a daughter\u00a0 of hers, notwithstanding what is set\u00a0 forth\u00a0 in her baptismal certificate, Exhibit A.<\/p><p>With regard to natural children, article 136 of the Civil Code prescribes that the mother is obliged to recognize the natural child:\u00a0 \"2.\u00a0\u00a0 When, the fact of the birth and the identity of the child are duly proven.\"<\/p><p>The contention of Lorenza Sombillo is\u00a0 that she should be recognized as the legitimate daughter of Magdalena, yet she could have proved that the latter gave birth to her in the house where the latter's husband was living.\u00a0 Lorenza furnished no such proof.\u00a0 Lucio Pahati, on the other hand, a witness for the appellee, testified that he had seen Toribia Carreon in a pregnant state and afterwards give birth to a child who was subsequently called Lorenza.\u00a0\u00a0 This witness swore that the latter's mother was Toribia Carreon, a sister of the testatrix, Magdalena Carreon.<\/p><p>The document, Exhibit B, drawn up\u00a0 in Tagalog\u00a0 and which is alleged to be the will of the deceased Magdalena Carreon, is not shown to have been\u00a0 probated, nor does\u00a0 it appear to have been admitted as proof of the arguments advanced\u00a0 in the opposition made by Lorenza Sombillo to the probate of the aforementioned previous will of the said deceased; and,\u00a0 therefore, not being an authentic document, it could not be legally admitted as proof of the filiation in question.<\/p><p>The appellant Lorenza Sombillo, being convinced that she lacked the requisites\u00a0 specified in\u00a0 article\u00a0 115 of the Civil\u00a0 Code, endeavored to prove\u00a0 her\u00a0 filiation by the uninterrupted enjoyment of the status of a legitimate child of the testatrix.\u00a0\u00a0 In this attempt she was unsuccessful, as so held by the lower court, the judge basing his conclusion on the evidence presented at trial, which\u00a0 conclusively\u00a0 shows the impropriety of the appellant's claim.<\/p><p>For the foregoing reasons,\u00a0 whereby the errors assigned to the judgment appealed from have been refuted, we are of opinion that the said judgment should be and it is hereby affirmed, as it\u00a0 is in accordance with the\u00a0 law and the evidence.\u00a0 The costs\u00a0 of\u00a0 this\u00a0 instance\u00a0 shall be against the appellant.\u00a0 So\u00a0 ordered.<\/p><p><em>Arellano, C.\u00a0 J., Mapa, Johnson, Carson,<\/em> and <em>Trent, JJ.<\/em>.concur.<\/p><\/div>",

S. Powell presiding, and sentenced to seventeen years four months and one  day of <em>reclusion temporal<\/em>,  to pay the heirs of the deceased P1,000, and to pay the costs, for the crime of homicide, appealed to this court.<\/p>\n<p>From the record it appears that the  appellant,  who  is the son of a man named  Apolinar, and  four or five companions went to the house of one Candoy on the night of November 8, 1910; that sometime after these men arrived at this house on that night, they, together with the people living in  said house, began singing  and drinking; that a quarrel and  fight ensued which resulted in the death  of Candoy and  Ando.   Subsequently  thereto,  criminal complaints were filed in  the  Court of First Instance  against this appellant and one Iyon, charging them  with the crime of homicide.   Iyon was tried first.  When the case against the appellant was called, a certain agreement with reference to admitting the testimony taken in the case against Iyon was entered into by  counsel for the  defendant and the provincial  fiscal.  This agreement, as stated by the trial court, was as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<em>Counsel de oficio<\/em>, Mr. Lozano, stated that with the sworn statement of the defendant in addition to the evidence taken in the case No.  1889,  that he would submit the case.   He said, and it was within the knowledge  of the court, that  he had been present all during the trial assisting the fiscal  in the case against Iyon and that Calixto had been  present and heard all the testimony in  the case against Iyon, and that he was willing for the record in the case against Iyon to be used in  the trial of this case.  The fiscal agreed to this, and the defendant, after being sworn, went upon  the stand.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The case was  submitted upon  the testimony of the appellant and that taken in the case against Iyon.<\/p>\n<p>Counsel  for the defendant now insists  that the trial court erred in allowing, to the prejudice of the  defendant. a stipulation between  the fiscal and the defendant's counsel, or, in other  words, that the court erred in admitting the testimony taken in the Iyon  case, and cites in  support  of this alleged error the case of the United States <em>vs.<\/em> Pobre (11 Phil.  Rep., 51).   On the other  hand, the Attorney-General insists that no such error was  committed for the reason, as  he says, that the defendant waived his right  to be confronted with  and  to  cross-examine the witnesses against him, and in support of his position cites the following cases: U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Donato (9 Phil, Rep., 701), U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Castaneda (10 Phil.  Rep., 761), U. S.  <em>vs.<\/em> Manlimos (11 Phil. Rep., 547). <\/p>\n<p>In the case relied upon by  counsel <em>de oficio<\/em> for the defendant, the fiscal and counsel for the accused in that case agreed that the internal-revenue agent and his companions would testify confirming the complaint in all of its parts; that the witnesses for the defense would declare that the alleged opium referred to in the complaint was ashes of the said drug, and that if the said article  was found in the house  of the accused,  it  was because the Chinaman Quin-quio,  who was authorized to have it in his possession, had  left it there and that the neighbors of the  accused would declare that he was not  in  the  habit of smoking opium.  Upon this  agreement the case  was  submitted to the court  and  the accused found  guilty  and  sentenced accordingly. <\/p>\n<p>Upon appeal, this court said: <\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The agreement entered into between the fiscal of Ilocos Norte and  counsel for the defendant refers to facts which favor the defense and to others connected  with the prosecution ;  no evidence whatever was adduced, nor was the testimony of the witnesses mentioned in  the  agreement taken. This is a practice which is not authorized and defeats the purpose of the criminal law, being an open violation of the rules  of criminal  procedure, and particularly of the  provisions of section 32 of General Orders, No. 58.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The judgment was set aside and a new trial ordered. In the first case cited by the Attorney-General, only one witness was  examined, but several agreements were made between  the representative of the  Government  and  the attorneys for the  defense, to the effect  that certain  witnesses would testify affirming the declaration of the witness for the prosecution, and other witnesses would testify to certain facts which would be material to the defense.   The declarations of the witness and of the accused were received verbally.  The accused  were  all  convicted  and  appealed. The Supreme Court said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"This  court, however, upon attempting to review the evidence, has found it impossible to  do so because of the reprehensible abuse committed  in resorting to such unlawful agreements, thereby frustrating the purposes of the law, which has been openly violated.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The judgment appealed from was declared null and void and a new trial ordered.<\/p>\n<p>In the second  case; the defendant Castaneda, as post-master, was short in his accounts.   He stated in defense that the shortage  was caused by the theft of funds by one Valleros.   Certain witnesses for the defense failed to appear and counsel agreed as to the  nature of the testimony which they  would have  given.  As the  accused knew the thief but made no complaint or effort to recover the money, his testimony  was considered  unworthy  of belief,  and as all the defaulting witnesses were  favorable  to the defendant and counsel for the Government accepted his statements as to the nature of the proposed  evidence as true, such non-appearance was held insufficient for granting a new trial, and the judgment was affirmed.<\/p>\n<p>In the third case, the defendant Manlimos was convicted of  the crime of  <em>estafa<\/em> and  sentenced accordingly.  Five witnesses testified, two  for  the prosecution  and three\u2014including the defendant\u2014for  the defense.  A certain agreement was  entered into  between the fiscal and counsel for the accused.  With reference to this agreement,  this Supreme Court said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"We can not accept as the full equivalent of proof on oath the agreement of counsel that, if certain additional  witnesses were produced and sworn on behalf of the prosecution as well as of the defense, they  would testify as the actual witnesses had done as to the very substance  of the issue.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The defendant  was acquitted of the crime charged, not upon the ground that this agreement was entered into, but upon a review of the record the court found that the offense, if one had been committed, did not  constitute <em>estafa<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>It is clear that  the doctrine  set forth in these cases is not applicable to the case at bar.  In the case cited by the counsel for the appellant, no testimony whatever was taken while in the case at bar we have before us not only the testimony of the appellant himself, but also all of the eviadence taken in the case against Iyon.  In the first case cited by  the  Attorney-General, this court  could  not review the testimony taken because such testimony, with the exception of one witness, was not before it.  In the  second case, some of the witnesses were examined and other witnesses for the accused failed to appear, but he expressly waived his right to present these witnesses,  and the Government, having accepted the statements as to the nature of the proposed evidence as true, thereby waived its right to cross-examine the absent witnesses.  This case might  be applicable  to the case at bar if no other question presented itself except that raised by the Attorney-General.  In the last  case, while it is true that this court said that  it could  not  accept as the full  equivalent of proof on oath that if  certain witnesses were produced they would testify as the actual witnesses had done as to the very substance of the issue, yet the decision did not rest upon this ground, but upon the ground that if a crime had been committed  at all it was not that of <em>estafa<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>In the case under consideration we not only have before us,  as we have said,  the testimony of the defendant himself but also all of the evidence taken in the case against Iyon, and furthermore, there is  in this record, as above quoted, an  express waive? on the part of the defendant  through his  attorney of his constitutional right to be confronted with and to cross-examine the witnesses against him.<\/p>\n<p>That a defendant in a criminal prosecution may waive the benefit of the constitutional privilege of  being confronted with the witnesses against him  is, we think, well settled. (12 Cyc, 545, and a long array of cases cited therein.)<\/p>\n<p>Again, the evidence complained of was admitted by the court on the express stipulation and agreement of the parties  made in open court.   Its admission thereupon became an established fact.   Its admissibility ceased  to be a question.  It could not be raised here any more than it could in the court below.  The only question  remaining relative to such evidence is its probative force and value.   By reason of the stipulation and agreement of the  attorney de oficio for  the defendant and the fiscal, the court made no ruling or decision on the admissibility of the evidence.  There being no ruling or decision of the court, there could be nothing in reference  to  this question  to  review.   Judge Cooley, speaking for a majority of the court in the case of the People <em>vs.<\/em> Murray (52 Mich., 290, 291), said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The respondent stands convicted  of the murder of one Emery  at Chesaning.  The homicide took place  while a circus was on exhibition at that place.  I shall notice in this  case only such errors assigned as, after the full presentation of the facts by Mr. Justice Sherwood, seem essential.<\/p>\n<p>\"A chief ground of error relied upon is that  the prosecution was allowed to put  in evidence certain depositions taken out of court of witnesses not present at the trial. The  facts seem to be that the attorneys for the  respective parties stipulated to put in certain depositions on  both sides, and  they were put in accordingly.  This, it is said, was in violation of the respondent's constitutional right  to be confronted with his witnesses.   But the court made no ruling in the matter; what was done was voluntarily done by the parties;  the  defendant  had the benefit of  the stipulation, and, for aught we can know, it may have been made chiefly in his interest.  But however that may be,  when the court has  made no ruling we can have nothing to review.  This court can not  relieve a party from  a criminal  conviction because of his own voluntary action on the trial.<\/p>\n<p>\"It is said the counsel for respondent was counsel assigned to him by the court and may not have been counsel of his choice.  We do not know how the  fact was, but we know it is  customary to allow the respondent to choose for himself.   But however that may be, the  counsel acted for  the respondent without objection, and  without complaint that he did not do the best he could for him.<\/p>\n<p>\"The  defendant undoubtedly  had a constitutional right to be confronted with his witnesses.   He waived  that right in this case, apparently for his own supposed advantage and to obtain evidence on his behalf.   It would  have been  a mere impertinence for the court  to have interfered and precluded this stipulation being acted upon.  But it would have been more than an impertinence;  it would have  been gross error.  And it would be palpable usurpation of power for us now to set  aside a judgment for a neglect of the court not at the time complained of, but in respect to something where any other course would have been plain error.<\/p>\n<p>\"Under the view taken by the respondent it would seem that, when the evidence had been obtained under this stipulation, the court was put in position  where it was impossible to avoid error; for if  the evidence was received, he might complain, as he  does now, that his  constitutional right was violated, and if the court refused to receive it  when he was consenting, the  respondent would  be entitled to have the conviction set aside for that error.<\/p>\n<p>\"I shall always be ready to preserve in its integrity every constitutional right; but I do not understand that the  Constitution is an instrument to play fast  and loose with  in criminal cases any more  than  in  any other,  or that  it is the business of courts to be astute in the discovery of technical  difficulties in  the  punishment of parties for their criminal conduct.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The record in the Iyon case was  admitted as evidence on the express stipulation of the parties. The court below had no discretion.   To hold that that evidence was inadmissible puts the trial court in the position described by  Judge Cooley in the quotation above.  If the  court admitted the evidence it was subject, according to the theory of  counsel for the appellant, to be charged with violating the defendant's constitutional right to be confronted with the witnesses against him and of admitting  incompetent evidence.  If the court had excluded such evidence, the defendant would have been entitled to have  the conviction  set aside for error involved in excluding from  the case evidence  whose  admissibility was agreed upon by all, and which the defendant himself, through his counsel, expressly asked to have admitted as essential to his proper defense.  In other words, the court would be reversed if it did and reversed if it did not.<\/p>\n<p>If the judgment appealed from is to be reversed and the case remanded for a new trial, it must be upon the ground of the disqualification of the attorney <em>de oficio<\/em> who represented the appellant in the court below.  If the attorney was in fact disqualified, this disqualification would not affect the legality  of any particular  step  in the  proceedings alone, but would touch equally every part  of the case from its inception to its close.  If an attorney is disqualified, it is presumed  that he can  not  properly advise the accused as to his rights; or as to how he should plead; or present testimony  of  his own; or sum up the  case finally to the court; or do anything in the conduct of the case from beginning to  end.  To determine this question it is necessary to inquire whether or not the  attorney changed  or had an opportunity to change  his position; that is, was his  position  when he  was  assisting the prosecution  in the case against Iyon  inconsistent or could it have been made so with that of his being attorney for this defendant?  It must be borne in mind that the attorney was appointed by the  court to represent the  appellant, and  we understand that it is customary in this  country for  the court, through its clerk,  to appoint attorneys to defend paupers charged with criminal offenses from a roster kept by  the  clerk. This method is followed in order to divide the work equally among the attorneys,  and  we see no  objection  to  such a  method.  But generally,  the attorney appointed is not selected by the  defendant,  who is given no choice in the matter.   The  defendant must  accept  whosoever is designated.<\/p>\n<p>These are the facts with reference to the question under consideration in the case at bar: Iyon killed Ando.   Calixto, the appellant, killed Candoy.  Candoy,  who was killed first, was the  father  of  Iyon.  Ando  was  a  brother-in-law of Calixto.  The trouble which resulted in  the death of these two men arose  in  the house  of  Candoy.  Ando  and his brother-in-law and their companions were in Candoy's house on the night of the trouble by invitation.  The attorney's position in assisting  the  prosecution in the  case against Iyon was that of showing that Iyon was the guilty party and that the killing of Ando was not justifiable.  In defending Calixto (the defendant), it was the duty of the attorney to show, if it could be done, that Candoy was the aggressor and not Calixto.  The testimony which was used to convict Iyon was incorporated by stipulation of the parties bodily into the case against this appellant.   In addition, the defendant himself testified.  This constitutes the evidence in the present case.  An analysis of the testimony taken in the Iyon case  shows  that  there was in fact nothing in that testimony presented by the prosecution  upon which a conviction of this appellant could be based.  It was the testimony of the defense in that case which convicted this appellant.   The record  in the Iyon case shows that there was no attempt on the part of Attorney Lozano to cross-examine the witnesses presented by the defendant in that case from the viewpoint of the defense in the case at bar.  The first time  that the theory of the appellant was  squarely before the court was when he himself took the stand.   The record does not disclose whether Mr. Lozano was appointed to rep- resent this appellant before or after the trial  of Iyon.  If he was appointed  before that trial, he did not, as we have said,  develop by cross-examination of the defendant's witnesses in that case against Iyon  the theory of self-defense which was the plea of this defendant.  Had the attorney attempted to .develop the theory of self-defense of Calixto, the court might have  held that that would have  been  improper in the case against  Iyon.  Again, if the lawyer had been appointed before the  trial of Iyon, he  could have consulted (and we do not  know whether he did or not) with Calixto and obtained from him all the facts about how the killing occurred, and the defense of this appellant.  This knowledge  probably could  have been used to advantage in the prosecution of Iyon and to the prejudice of the appellant. At least, there was an opportunity to do so.  If the attorney was appointed after the Iyon case was closed, he would have had no reason, of course, for developing the testimony in the case against Iyon which would have aided the defense of the appellant.  Viewed from any standpoint,  there was an  opportunity for the attorney to have acted in a double capacity.  The appearance of such injustice to clients must be avoided.  Courts will give approval in no degree to the conduct of Mr. Lozano.   He should have called the attention of the trial court to these facts, and the court would  then no  doubt have relieved  him as attorney  <em>de oficio<\/em> for the appellant.  Public policy prohibits him from defending tlie appellant under these circumstances; the reason for this prohibition is found in the relation of attorney and client, which  is one  of confidence and trust in  the very highest degree.  An attorney  becomes familiar with all  the facts connected with his client's cause.   He learns from his client the weak points of  the case as  well  as  the strong ones. Such  knowledge must  be  considered  sacred  and guarded with great care.  No opportunity  must be given attorneys to take advantage of the secrets of clients obtained while the confidential relation of attorney and client exists.  The members of the profession must have the fullest confidence of their  clients.  If it may be abused, the profession will suffer  by the loss  of  the confidence  of the  people.  The good of  the profession  as well as  the  safety of the clients demands a strict recognition and enforcement  of  the rules governing the relation of attorney and client.  We believe there are sufficient reasons in this  case under the facts and circumstances as presented to  hold  that  Mr. Lozano  was disqualified and could not legally represent the defendant in the court below.<\/p>\n<p>The  judgment appealed from must be set aside and a new trial ordered.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

PIO GUMIRAN, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>JOHNSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\"> On the 18th of February, 1909, the plaintiffs commenced an action in the Court of First Instance of the Province of Isabela, relating to the possession of a certain parcel of land, described in paragraph 2 of said complaint. The plaintiffs alleged that they were the absolute owners and entitled to the possession of said land; that upon the 6th day of May, 1908, they were in possession of said land and had been from time immemorial, and that, without any right or title, the defendant deprived them of the possession of the same, that the defendant was still in possession of said land and that the plaintiffs, by reason of such wrongful dispossession, had suffered damages in the sum of P500. The prayer of the petition of the plaintiffs was as follows:<br\/><blockquote> \"Therefore, the plaintiffs through their counsel pray the court to render judgment:<br\/><br\/>\"(1) Sentencing the defendant to restore the property described in paragraph 3 of this complaint;<br\/><br\/>\"(2) Declaring that the plaintiffs are entitled to possession and ownership of the said property and imposing perpetual silence upon the defendant with reference to his claims of ownership of said property;<br\/><br\/>\"(3) To payment of P500 damages;<br\/><br\/>\"(4) To pay the costs of this case; and<br\/><br\/>\"(5) Any other relief and compensation that the court may consider just and equitable.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>To the foregoing complaint the defendant presented a demurrer, based upon the ground that the Court of First Instance did not have jurisdiction of said cause\u2014that the action was one over which the courts of justices of the peace had exclusive jurisdiction.<br\/><br\/>After hearing the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause, the Honorable Richard Campbell, judge, rendered the following decision:<br\/><blockquote>\"On March 20, 1909, the defendant filed in this case a demurrer to the complaint on the ground that the allegations of the plaintiff, as set forth in said complaint, brought this matter within the purview of the provisions of section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure; and that therefore the action is for illegal detainer; that this court accordingly lacks jurisdiction to try this case, for the reason that the facts set forth in the complaint demonstrate that the detainer alleged by the plaintiff occurred within a year from the date when the cause of action arose, and that therefore it should have been instituted in the justice of the peace court.<br\/><br\/>\"The case was called for trial on January 12, 1910, the attorneys Messrs. MacDougall and Concepcion appearing for the plaintiff and Messrs. Hawkins and Harvey for the defendant.<br\/><br\/>\"After hearing the arguments of counsel for both parties and having carefully considered the law applicable to the questions raised by the defendant in his demurrer, as well as the legal precedents cited by both parties, the court is of the opinion that the demurrer should be sustained.<br\/><br\/>\"The allegation of the plaintiff's counsel that this is an action for recovery, and not an action for forcible entry, seems to be based solely on the fact that in drawing up the complaint the phraseology of section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure was not used; but this court believes that the complaint very clearly brings this matter under the provisions of section 80, and, according to the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Ledesma vs. Marcos (9 Phil. Rep., 618), which is one of the precedents cited by the plaintiff's counsel in support of his contention, an action for recovery based on any of the provisions of section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure can not be instituted in the Court of First Instance within one year from the time when the cause of action arose. Even though it is possible to conceive that an action for recovery may be outside the provisions of section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure, if such is the case, the plaintiff should have adduced in his complaint facts sufficient to demonstrate thereby that this action is outside the legal provisions governing an action for illegal detainer.<br\/><br\/>\"Since the plaintiff preferred to exercise together in a single complaint of action for recovery the action for possession and the action for recovering title, he should have waited for the period of one year to elapse from the date when the cause of action arose before filing his complaint in this court, because the Court of First Instance has no jurisdiction over an action for recovery until after the expiration of the time prescribed by section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure. (Archbishop of Manila vs. Municipality of Rosario, 14 Phil. Rep., 176; Bishop of Cebu vs. Mangaron, 6 Phil. Rep., 286; Ledesma vs. Marcos, 9 Phil. Rep., 618.)<br\/><br\/>\"Therefore, the court sustains the demurrer and declares this cause dismissed.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>From that decision the plaintiffs appealed and made the following assignments of error:<br\/><blockquote>\"I. The court erred in declaring that the complaint filed in this case constitutes a summary action for possession included within the provisions of section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure in force in the Philippine Islands, Act No. 190, wherefore the Court of First Instance lacks original jurisdiction over the matter in litigation.<br\/><br\/>\"II. The court erred in declaring that the action for recovery as well as the action for restitution of possession of a parcel of real estate can not be instituted in the Court of First Instance within one year from the time when the cause of action arose.<br\/><br\/>\"III. The court erred in sustaining the defendant's demurrer and in dismissing the plaintiffs' complaint.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>By reference to the complaint, it will be noted that the present action was commenced on the 18th of February, 1909, and that the alleged dispossession of the plaintiffs took place on the 6th of May, 1908. The action, therefore, was commenced within one year from the time of the alleged dispossession. We are of the opinion that the only question presented in this appeal is whether or not the present action can be maintained in the Court of First Instance, in view of the provisions of section 80 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions, as amended by Act No. 1778. Said section 80 provides for a special remedy for the purpose of recovering the possession of land under special facts and gives justices of the peace original jurisdiction in such cases. The facts upon which said action (forcible entry and detainer) can be brought, are specially mentioned in said section. They are: \"That the person has been deprived of the possession of his lands by force, intimidation, threat, strategy, or stealth,\" etc. Of course we do not mean to decide that the complaint must allege, in the language of the statute, that the person has been deprived of his possession by force, intimidation, threat, strategy, or stealth. The plaintiff in an action of <i>desahucio<\/i> must set up in his complaint facts which show that the dispossession took place by reason of force, intimidation, etc.<br\/><br\/>In the present case the allegation in the complaint is simply that the plaintiff has been \"deprived\" of the land of which he is and has been the legal owner for a long period. This allegation is not sufficient to show that the action is based upon the provisions of said section 80. Moreover, upon an examination of the prayer of the complaint, it is seen that the plaintiff is not only seeking to be repossessed of the land but desires also a declaration that he is the owner of the same. It is quite clear, from an examination of the complaint, that, had the same been presented in the court of the justice of the peace, it would have been demurrable, for the reason that the facts alleged fact to show that the plaintiff had been dispossessed by any of the methods mentioned in said section 80.<br\/><br\/>It is a general rule of pleading and practice that in ah pleadings filed in courts of special jurisdiction, the special facts giving the court jurisdiction must be specially alleged and set out. Unless these special jurisdictional facts are alleged, the complaint is demurrable. The complaint in the present case not containing allegations showing the special jurisdiction of the justice of the peace, the same would have been demurrable had it been filed in the court of a justice of the peace.<br\/><br\/>Said section 80 does not cover all of the cases of dispossession of lands. Whenever the owner is dispossessed by any other means than those mentioned in said section, he may maintain his action in a Court of First Instance, and it is not necessary for him to wait until the expiration of twelve months before commencing an action to be repossessed and to be declared to be the owner of said land. The summary action before a justice of the peace is given only for the special circumstances mentioned in said section (80). In all other cases Courts of First Instance have jurisdiction, even though the twelve months have not elapsed. (Alonso vs. Municipality of Placer, 5 Phil. Rep., 71; Roman Catholic Church vs. Familiar, 11 Phil. Rep., 310; Gutierrez vs. Rosario, 15 Phil. Rep., 116.)<br\/><br\/>Prior to the existence of Act No. 2041, justices of the. peace could not try questions of title to land. In an action of forcible entry, and detainer, therefore, the question of ownership can not be tried. (Bishop of Cebu vs. Mangaron, 6 Phil. Rep., 286; Barlin vs. Ramirez, 7 Phil. Rep., 41; Evangelista vs. Tabayuyong, 7 Phil. Rep., 607; Ty Laco Cioco vs. Muro et al. 9 Phil. Rep., 100.)<br\/><br\/>It is not believed that it was the intention of the Legislature in giving justices of the peace original, exclusive jurisdiction in the cases mentioned in said section 80, to thereby deprive the Courts of First Instance of original jurisdiction in other cases of dispossession, where the plaintiff desired to have the question of his title determined at the same time, even though the action should be commenced in the Court of First Instance within the year. For all of the foregoing reasons, we are of the opinion and so decide that, under the facts alleged in the complaint in the present case, the Court of First Instance had jurisdiction and therefore the demurrer presented by the defendant should have been overruled.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the lower court, sustaining the demurrer, is hereby reversed, and the case is hereby remanded to the lower court, with direction that the defendant be permitted to file his answer within the time specified by law; and without any finding as to costs, it is so ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa<\/i>, and <i>Moreland, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<\/div>",

The defendants, after denying each and all of the allegations of  the complaint alleged that they were  the owners and entitled to the possession of the lands in question. After  hearing the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause, the Honorable Dionisio  Chanco found that the evidence did not show that the plaintiff was the owner of the lands in question and also that the lands had not been sufficiently identified.  The decision was filed on the 13th day of December, 1909.<\/p>\n<p>It appears  from the  record that after the  plaintiff had closed his case, none of the witnesses for the defendants were present in the court room and the attorney for the defendants asked that he be given a few moments for the purpose of finding his witnesses.  This request on the part of the attorney for the defendants was denied.  There was, therefore, no proof adduced during the trial of the cause to support the contentions of the defendants.<\/p>\n<p>On the  27th of December, 1909, the attorney for the plaintiff  presented a motion for a new trial, supported by an  affidavit, based upon the ground that he had discovered two documents, Exhibits B and C, which he alleged showed that the lands in question belonged to him,  and that he had used due diligence in attempting to find  said documents. This motion was  denied by the lower court.  These documents (Exhibits B and C) were united  with the record brought to this court.  The defendants, however, had no opportunity in  the court below to  present  objections to their admissibility nor to present  evidence to overcome their legal effect as proof.  If may be that these documents will supply the very defect of title  upon which the lower court decided that the plaintiff  was not the owner of the lands in question.<\/p>\n<p>In practically every case relating to lands which comes to this court by appeal from the Ilocos provinces, there seems to be difficulty about the identification of the lands in question.   It would seem to be a wise course to adopt by the lower court in case of deficiency of evidence relating to the identity of land, to make an ocular inspection himself or to appoint a commission for that purpose in order that the court may know just what lands are in litigation.   In  actions for the recovery  of the possession  of  land, the  description should be  so definite that an officer of the court whose duty it is to carry out the order of the court, might go into the locality where the land,is situated and definitely locate it.  There ought not to be any difficulty in identifying lands, for example as in the present case, where the parties claim to have been in possession for a long period of time.<\/p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons the  judgment  of  the lower court is set aside and a new trial is hereby ordered, to the end that the plaintiff may have an opportunity to present the newly discovered evidence and that the defendants be given an opportunity to adduce such additional evidence as they may deem necessary, and without any finding as to costs.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

I., the accused, having formed a band of  more than three malefactors,  provided  with <em>talibones,<\/em> did, unlawfully, willfully and criminally, assault the house of Francisco Tolosa and, after having seized, Violently and with intent of gain, money and other effects  belonging to Francisco Tolosa and his family, which amounted in value to P908,35, did treacherously kill the said Tolosa; in violation of law.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The case having been prosecuted against Nicolas Matinong and Francisca Magsipoc only, for the  reason that the other accused had not been apprehended, the court acquitted the latter and sentenced the former, Nicolas Matinong, to the  penalty of life imprisonment, with the accessories of the law, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the  sum of P1,000, and to pay an additional  sum of P908.35, as an indemnity for the effects robbed, and one-half of the costs of the trial.<\/p>\n<p>The  case has come before this court through an appeal by Nicolas Matinong from the foregoing judgment.<\/p>\n<p>The  evidence fully  demonstrates the appellant's guilt. As  the Attorney-General  says  in  his brief,  it  has  been satisfactorily proven  that  it  was the said appellant  who proposed to his companions the assault upon the house of Francisco Tolosa; that,  armed with a <em>talibon,<\/em>  he accompanied them during the assault; that, while the assault was being made, he stood watch at the foot of the stairs of the said house so that his companions would not be caught, and that, finally, he accompanied them to the place  where  the deceased was killed.   These  facts  evidently  render  him responsible as  a principal by direct participation in the crime with which he is charged  in  the information.<\/p>\n<p>There is to be considered, in the commission of the crime, the attendance of the aggravating circumstance of treachery embracing that of the criminal act having been perpetrated at night in an  uninhabited place (as was the place where the deceased was killed) and by a band,  as an integral part of  the plan formed by the accused for the commission of the crime with security to themselves and without risk.<\/p>\n<p>The  Attorney-General suggests  that  the  aggravating circumstance of premeditation should also  be taken into account.  It is unquestionable that there was premeditation with respect to the robbery, but, as it  is inherent in this latter crime, it should not be considered as an aggravating circumstance.  There is not sufficient  proof that the death of the deceased was premeditated by the accused.  It may very well have happened  that the resolution  to  kill Francisco Tolosa arose in the minds of the accused at the last minute as a result of some unforeseen incident which may have occurred  during the course  of events.  We may cite, as an example, the occurrence related in the following words by Luis Dagono,  a witness for the prosecution:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"When they  (the malefactors) arrived, that man who was holding me asked Asis  (the deceased)  the question: 'Do you know me?\"  Asis answered: 'Yes.'  When Asis answered that he knew him, that man, this party Cornelio, unsheathed his talibon and gave Asis a cut with it  on the head.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>This appears to indicate that the malefactors commenced to wound the deceased as soon as the latter showed that he knew some  of them, and that,  had not  this  incident occurred, possibly they might not have taken his life.  Be this as it may, the fact remains that, aside  from the fact itself of the death of the deceased, there is  no conclusive proof in the record that the accused premeditated the taking of their victim's life, in the  legal and technical  sense  of the word <em>premeditation<\/em> as a term of law.<\/p>\n<p>After due examination of all the circumstances  of the case, we are of the  opinion that the trial judge was right ,  in giving the appellant the benefit of the extenuating circumstance of article 11 of the Penal Code, and which must be set off against the aggravating circumstance of <em>alevosia<\/em> found in this decision to have existed.  It  is, therefore, proper to impose upon the said appellant the  penalty of <em> cadena perpetua<\/em>, which was done in the judgment appealed from.<\/p>\n<p>The said judgment is affirmed,  with the  costs  of this instance against the appellant.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

(2)\u00a0 the fact that his\u00a0 right\u00a0 hand was disabled; and (3) the medical certificate issued by a physician as a result of the autopsy. <br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>The defendant's daughter averred that it was she who struck Marciano Magno\u00a0 the\u00a0 blow\u00a0 with the fist, for the reason that the deceased had\u00a0 caught hold of her hand with unchaste designs, and testified that her father arrived after Magno had fallen to the ground, which testimony was supported,by two witnesses.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>This defense was not sustained by the trial judge.\u00a0 But on the contrary, he accepted the preponderance of evidence for the prosecution, sustained by three witnesses, of whom two were eyewitnesses to the crime, and the other, of the confession alleged to have been made to him by the defendant when\u00a0 arrested by this witness, to the effect that the victim's death was an unlooked-for misfortune.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>Nor\u00a0 was the defense advanced by the defendant to the effect that his\u00a0 right hand was crippled and he was unable to\u00a0 work with it sustained by the trial court, and rightly, since,\u00a0 as the defendant testified, he worked with his left hand and\u00a0 sometimes used a\u00a0 spoon\u00a0 with his\u00a0 right; moreover, it was not proved that\u00a0 it was impossible for him to strike blows with either hand.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>The defense\u00a0 founded on the medical examination of the corpse consists in that the physician who made the autopsy declared that he had\u00a0 observed\u00a0 hypertrophy of\u00a0 the heart, a discharge in\u00a0 the spleen,\u00a0 an\u00a0 increase of this latter organ to four times its ordinary\u00a0 size,\u00a0 and abdominal peritonitis; and in\u00a0 that, according to\u00a0 this\u00a0 examination, the\u00a0 cause\u00a0 of death can\u00a0 not be determined\u00a0 for the blows which he\u00a0 may have received could have coincided with the traumatism, and \"the\u00a0 traumatisms which\u00a0 that body received\u00a0 hastened the death of the said individual;\" and, finally, this witness being questioned by the defense as to whether the cause of death was a traumatism or a shock, replied that he was unable to determine which it was.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>As was\u00a0 proper, neither was\u00a0 this\u00a0 defense sustained by the trial judge.\u00a0\u00a0 The defendant was, therefore, found guilty of the crime of homicide and sentenced to twelve years and one\u00a0 day of <em>reclusion temporal<\/em>,\u00a0 to the accessory\u00a0 penalties and an\u00a0 indemnity of M.,000 to\u00a0 the\u00a0 heirs of the\u00a0 deceased, and to the payment of the\u00a0 costs; from which judgment he appealed.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>This appeal, forwarded from the Court of First\u00a0 Instance of Nueva Ecija, having been heard, together with the allegations and arguments therein made by the parties, whereby\u00a0 it appears\u00a0 to have been well proven that\u00a0 the defendant did strike Marciano Magno in the abdomen and in the back two blows with his hand, as a result of which the latter fell to the ground, and scarcely had he gotten up and started to walk when\u00a0 he\u00a0 fell down\u00a0 dead, we hold\u00a0 that the crime is properly classified as\u00a0 homicide\u00a0 and that Rosalino Rodriguez is responsible therefor,<p><\/p><p> A blow with the fist or a kick, though causing no external wound, may very\u00a0 well produce inflammation of the spleen and peritonitis and cause death; and although the assaulted party was previously affected by some internal\u00a0 malady,\u00a0 if, because of a blow given with the hand or the foot, his death was hastened, beyond peradventure he is responsible therefor who produced the cause\u00a0 for such acceleration as the result of a voluntary and unlawfully inflicted injury.<\/p><p> But in the complaint itself it is\u00a0 alleged\u00a0 that the cause of the assault was\u00a0 the fact\u00a0 that the defendant saw the deceased catch hold of his daughter Roberta's\u00a0 hand, for the purpose of making love to her, and the provincial fiscal stated at the trial that this assertion was the result of a careful investigation\u00a0 made by him, which was indeed confirmed by the facts proven.<\/p><p> It therefore appears that the defendant's act was preceded by an immediate provocation on the part of the deceased, and,\u00a0 evidently, the defendant did not intend to cause\u00a0 so grave an injury as he produced.<\/p><p> With the existence of these two well-defined extenuating circumstances and without any\u00a0 aggravating circumstance, rule 5 of article 81 of the Penal Code must\u00a0 be applied and the penalty\u00a0 immediately inferior to that fixed by law imposed.\u00a0 Consequently, modifying the penalty imposed by the lower court to eight years and one day of prision mayor, the judgment appealed from is affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<\/p><p><em>Mapa, Johnson, Carson<\/em>, and <em>Trent, JJ<\/em>., concur.<br\/><\/p><\/div>",

This evidence  of  the defendant himself and not  of any witness for the plaintiff furnishes the secondary evidence of the contests of a document authorized by section 321 of the Code of Civil  Procedure, in case of loss, that is, \"the recollection of a witness:\" a relevant  witness in this case for he is the very party prejudiced by the document, whose contents it was unnecessary for the plaintiff to remember, as it was the defendant himself who offered at the trial complete recollection both of the form in which  it  was executed and of its context.  By the defendant's own confession the court learns of the title whereby the plaintiff seeks to recover the land and  it is proof so plain that no other is needed.<\/p>\n<p>As for the third assignment, since it appears that the land was sold twice to two different persons, to Maximiano Seguf  on January 4,  1908, and to Esteban Sabellano and others on August 20,1910, the matter comes directly under article 1473, according to which:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Should there be no entry, the property shall belong to the person who first took  possession of it in good faith, and, in the absence thereof, to  the person who presents  the oldest title, provided there is good faith.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The judgment of the  trial court in favor of the plaintiff, who exhibits the oldest title, is. not improper, since it is not shown who is actually  in  possession,  although  it may be presumed that the defendant is. since he is such defendant in a suit for recovery, but this possession of his is only that incident to his going upon the land and taking the crop growing thereon.<\/p>\n<p>As for the last assignment, the findings of the judgment are strictly in accordance with law, for Maximiano SeguI first bought the land and so at his death it must pass to his widow and heirs, whose personalities are established by the documentary evidence brought into this higher court with the bill of exceptions without objection, and even, though it is only a declaration in their favor of legal title of ownership in the land,  the judgment could conclude in no other way than by making  such  declaration.  With reference to restitution of the crop, the appellants say that \"there is no proof in the case that  the defendants  took possession of any crop belonging to the  plaintiff,\" but on page 8 of his testimony the defendant Sabellano says that  he took the last crop: \"while I was harvesting on the land by means of my people,\" as he says, \"and at about nine or ten o'clock m the morning the plaintiff Eugenia Savella appeared there on the land to object to  our ordering the crops on said land to be harvested, alleging that Mariano Segui had bought it in April, 1908, and, being unable to stop us, she took down our names and laid an information against us in the justice of the peace court for robbery.\"<\/p>\n<p>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with the understanding that the declaration of ownership in the plaintiff's favor extends to her children had by her deceased husband, Maximiano Segui; with the costs of this instance against the appellants.<\/p>\n<p><em>Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson, Moreland,<\/em> and <em>Trent, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<\/p>\n<\/div>",

The trial  court  found the plaintiff to be the  owner  of a part of the land described in his complaint and entitled to receive the products therefrom, amounting to P175.  The defendant appealed.<\/p>\n<p>For the  purpose of  establishing his title,  the plaintiff presented a  certified  copy  of  a  possessory information obtained  in 1897 and  duly registered  the following year, and also the testimony of himself and one other witness to the effect that the plaintiff had been  for more than twenty years prior to 1904 in  possession of the land in question. On the other hand, three witnesses, including the defendant, testified that the defendant  is now and  has been  in  possession of a part of the  land described  in the complaint since  the  year 1890, and  that the other  part is  possessed by one Epifanio  Blancaflor.  The  defendant also presented a notarial document in which it appears that he purchased from  Tiburcio, Felipe,  Placido, and Paulino  Cirera the land claimed by him.<\/p>\n<p>While it  cannot be said that a possessory information, although  duly  registered, which was  obtained  in  1897, is conclusive either as to ownership or possession,  yet, in this case, the possessory information presented by the plaintiff, taken  in connection with the oral testimony presented by him, shows  clearly that he is the real owner of that part of the land sought to be recovered which is now in possession of the defendant.  It is  true  that  the defendant claimed that he purchased this land in 1890 from the above-named parties and that in support of this claim he presented the notarial document which was  executed on April  30,  1910 (some ten days before the institution of this action).  The defendant testified that this notarial document was executed at the time  he  made the purchase in 1890 and that this is the same identical document which he received at that time, while the  document shows upon its face and also from the notary's certificate that it was executed on April 30, 1910. So the defendant's testimony in reference to having received this document in 1890 cannot possibly be true.  The defense attempted to explain this point by trying to show  that this notarial document is a copy of the private document executed in favor of the  defendant in that year.  The old document, if it existed, was  not  presented, neither was  there any attempt made to present the same.   The record  shows conclusively that the  execution of this notarial document was made for the sole  purpose of trying  to defeat the  plaintiff, and that the defendant never purchased any part of this land.<\/p>\n<p>CounseI for the  defendant,  in his printed brief,  insists that the trial court erred in admitting the certified copy of the possessory  information presented by the plaintiff, and bases this contention upon the provisions of section 284 of the Code of Civil Procedure.   This section treats of original writings and provides that there can be no evidence of the contents of a writing other than the writing itself, except in certain cases, one of these cases being when the original is a  record or  other document in the custody of a public official.  The  document presented by the plaintiff is a copy of the possessory information  taken from  the property registry and duly certified by the registrar of deeds.  And furthermore,  his objection, which was raised for the first time on appeal, comes too late.<\/p>\n<p>It  was also contended that the trial court  erred in rendering judgment against the defendant for the products of that portion of  the land which he has occupied since 1904. We  think  this  contention  is well founded.   The plaintiff, prior to 1904, had been in possession of this land cultivating it almost every year for a period of more than  twenty years. But it appears that  about the latter part of 1903 he ceased to cultivate this land and  that the defendant entered into possession of part of the same and has continued in the use and occupation  of that part up to the present time.  The plaintiff has paid very little attention to this land since that year.  So little  that he did not know at the time this case was tried that one Blancaflor was in possession of a part of the land sought  to be recovered by him.  All of this land is occupied by the defendant and Blancaflor,  but it does not appear how much is occupied by each one.  The plaintiff testified that when he cultivated all of the land he produced some 80 to 100 <em>cavanes<\/em> of <em>palay<\/em> annually.  Another witness testified that palay since 1904 has sold for from two pesos to two and one-half pesos per cavan.  There is nothing in the record to show what portion of the crop should belong to the landlord and what portion to the  occupant, neither does the record show with any degree of certainty how much of the 2.2625 hectares  in the entire piece is in possession  of the defendant.  The testimony presented by the plaintiff is so indefinite and uncertain that a money judgment for the unlawful use and occupation of the land by the defendant cannot be sustained.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, the judgment appealed from  should be  and hereby is modified by disallowing  recovery for the products of the land.  As thus modified, the same is affirmed without costs.<\/p>\n<p><em>Torres, Mapa, Johnson,<\/em> and <em>Carson, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<br\/>\n<\/p>\n<\/div>",

Said protest was overruled by the Collector of Customs and the plaintiff appealed to the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila.<br\/><br\/>In the Court of First Instance the parties, by stipulation, entered into the following agreement:<br\/><blockquote> \"That of the coffee referred to in the proceedings in the above-entitled case, 350 kilos (net dutiable weight) of V. P. coffee were imported into the United States roasted and there ground and packed for shipment to the Philippine Islands; that of the coffee referred to in the proceedings in the above-entitled case, 330 kilos (net dutiable weight) of V. P. ground coffee were imported into the United States both roasted and ground, and there packed in small retail packages for shipment to the Philippine Islands; that the remainder of the coffee referred to in the proceedings in the above-entitled case was imported into the United States as green coffee in the whole grain, and was roasted and ground and packed for shipment in the United States; that the nutmeg, cloves, mace, thyme and the coriander seeds referred to in the proceedings in the above-entitled case were all imported into the United States as whole seeds, flowers, or leaves, and were in the United States ground into the powder known as ground nutmeg, ground cloves, ground mace, ground thyme and ground coriander seed, respectively.<br\/><br\/>\"2.

That the above-entitled matter may be decided forthwith by the Court of First Instance upon the foregoing stipulation of facts, and upon the record transmitted to and now on file in that court by the Bureau of Customs; that appellant shall file his argument in writing within ten days from the date of this stipulation, and that the Insular Collector of Customs shall file his written argument in reply thereto within ten days after receipt of copy of the written argument of plaintiff, as hereinbefore provided.<br\/><br\/>\"Dated at Manila, P. I., this 27th day of June, 1911.<br\/><br\/>(Signed) \"Bruce, Lawrence, Ross &amp; Block,<br\/><br\/>\"<i>Attorneys for plaintiff<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>(Signed) \"J. W. Ferrier, <i>Attorney for defendant<\/i>.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Upon the foregoing agreed facts, the Honorable A. S. Crossfield, judge, sustained the Collector of Customs in a decision, the dispositive part of which is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"The roasting, grinding, and packing for shipment does not, in my opinion, make the coffee which was imported into the United States an article of the manufacture of the United States for the reason that it is coffee still and the labor which has been placed upon it has been only one of the steps taken in preparing it for use. The grinding of nutmeg, cloves, mace, thyme, and coriander seed does not change the character of the article, but the labor used is only preparing the article for use and does not change its character in any way.<br\/><br\/>\"The conclusions are that the appeal should be dismissed.\" From that decision the plaintiff appealed to this court and made the following assignment of error:<br\/><br\/>\"And now comes the appellant, by its undersigned counsel, and avers that in the trial of the above-entitled cause in the Court of First Instance of Manila, there was error to the prejudice of the appellant, in that said Court of First Instance, by its decision, affirmed the ruling of the Collector of Customs.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The question presented for decision by said assignment of error is more concretely stated by appellant in his brief, as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"The sole question presented in this case is whether roasting and grinding, as to coffee, and grinding as to several enumerated spices, constitute 'manufacture,' within the meaning of the Tariff Revision Law of 1909; for, although the question of roasted but unground coffee is presented, it is rather for the purpose of getting a judicial ruling than in the spirit of protest against the decision of the Collector.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Section 12 of the Tariff Law of 1909, entitled \"An Act to raise revenue for the Philippine Islands, and for other purposes,\" Public Laws of the Philippine Islands, volume 7, pages 367 to 416, at page 412, provides:<br\/><blockquote> \"That all articles, except rice, the growth, product, or <i>manufacture of the United States and its possessions<\/i> to which the customs tariff in force in the United States is applied and upon which no drawback customs duty has been allowed therein, going into the Philippine Islands shall hereafter be admitted therein free of customs duty when the same are shipped directly from the country of origin to the country of destination: Provided, That direct shipmeat shall include shipment in bond through foreign territory contiguous to the United States. Said articles shall be as originally packed without having been opened or in any manner changed in condition: Provided, however, That if such articles shall become unpacked while en route, by accident, wreck or other casualty, or so damaged as to necessitate their repacking, the same shall be admitted free of duty upon satisfactory proof that the unpacking occurred through accident or necessity, and that the merchandise involved is the identical merchandise originally shipped from the United States or its possessions as hereinbefore provided, and that its condition has not been changed except for such damage as may have been sustained.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It is admitted that the merchandise in question had been originally imported into the United States, and that it had been imported into the Philippine Islands from the United States \"directly;\" that is, shipped in one bottom and not transshipped en route.<br\/><br\/>The sole question presented then is, whether roasting and grinding coffee and grinding the enumerated spices, constitute \"manufacture,\" within the meaning of the Tariff Law. If the grinding and roasting of the coffee and the grinding of the spices constitute a manufacture, then the said merchandise should be admitted free of duty and the amount collected by the Collector of Customs should be returned to the appellant.<br\/><br\/>The term \"manufacture\" has been defined many, many times, not only by writers of dictionaries but by the courts. The definition given by the writers of dictionaries has not always been followed by the courts. Courts, in their definitions, have been governed by the general provisions and the ultimate object of particular statutes. An examination of the decisions of the courts in which the term \"manufacture\" has been defined, shows that different and conflicting definitions have been given. These different definitions have been the result of an effort on the part of the courts to give to a particular statute the effect and operation intended by the legislature. For example, under a statute in the interest of protecting life, requiring all manufactories carried on in large buildings, to place fire escapes thereon, one for every fifteen persons employed in such establishment, the courts might give the word \"manufacture\" a definition which would require the owners of such establishments to place fire escapes in buildings where a large number of people are actually employed, even though the articles produced by such employees would not themselves be regarded as manufactured articles. (Landgraf vs. Kuh, 188 Ill., 484, 488.) To illustrate\u2014a large building is erected for the sole purpose of refining sugar. The crude sugar is purchased in large quantities. A thousand men are employed in the building for the sole purpose of assisting in the refining of the sugar. The courts have held that refining sugar is not a process of manufacture (State vs. American Sugar Refining Co., 51 La. Ann., 562; 25 Southern Reporter, 447, 453), and yet for the courts to hold, under a law requiring fire escapes to be placed on buildings used for manufacture, that fire escapes are not required under the law in the case supposed would shock the common sense of justice and defeat the purposes of such a law. In many cities large bakeries are established, for the purpose of furnishing bread at wholesale and retail, in which are employed hundreds of men and women. Baking bread has been held not to be a manufacture. (State vs. Eckendorf, 46 La. Ann., 131; 14 Southern Reporter, 518), yet courts would be justified, under the example above given, in holding, under such a law, that fire escapes would have to be placed in buildings so used. (See also Harttranft vs. Wiegman, 121 U. S., 609; Tide Water Oil Company vs. U. S., 171 U. S., 210.) Thus it will be seen that lexicographers and courts in their definition of terms, the former attempting to base their definition upon the etymology of the terms used, and the latter attempting to give force and effect to legislative enactments, may differ in their conclusions as to the meaning, signification, and application of terms used.<br\/><br\/>Mr. Bouvier, in his law dictionary, defines the word \"manufacture\" as follows:<br\/><br\/>\"It includes any new combination of old material, constituting a new result or production in any vendible article, not being machinery,\" and cites the cases of Murphy vs. Aronson (96 U. S., 134) and City of New Orleans vs. LeBlanc (34 La. Ann., 596).<br\/><br\/>Without doubt the original meaning given the word \"manufacture\" was \"to make by hand,\" being a definition based upon the etymology of the term, but this original meaning, by the introduction of scientific methods and machinery, has long since lost its significance. (14 American and English Encyclopedia of Law, 257-259.)<br\/><br\/>Laws exempting property from taxation and from the payment of revenue are always strictly construed, the general rule being that every citizen must bear his share of the expenses of the Government. Exemptions are repugnant. Favoritism under the law, in whatever form, is not justified. (City vs. Coffee Company, 46 La. Ann., 87; North Mo. R. Co. vs. Maguire, 20 Wall. (U. S.), 46; Bank of Commerce vs. Tennessee, 161 U. S., 134; People vs. Commissioners of Texas, 76 N. Y., 64; People vs. Peck, 157 N. Y. 51; State vs. Board of Assessors, 47 La. Ann., 1498.)<br\/><br\/>With this principle in mind, it is the duty of the court to give the tariff law above quoted a strict interpretation, which will give force and effect to such law. The primary purpose of the law is to produce revenue.<br\/><br\/>We are not without precedents upon the question presented by the appellant. In the case of People ex rel. Union Pacific Tea Company vs. Roberts (145 N. Y., 375), the supreme court of New York held, that \"the combination of teas, the roasting, grinding and mixing of coffee, are processes which result in no new article, as it is still coffee and tea that is placed upon the market,\" and that such process is not \"manufacture\" in the legal sense.<br\/><br\/>In the case of City vs. Coffee Company (46 La. Ann., 87) the supreme court of Louisiana held that roasting coffee was not a manufacture of coffee, citing in support of such decision Harttranft vs. Wiegman (121 U. S., 609), where the Supreme Court of the United States held that where the outer layer of shells was cleaned off by acid and the second layer then ground off by an emery wheel so as to expose the brilliant inner layer, the result was not a manufactured article. The shells in question are not manufactured and are not manufactures of shells. They are still shells; they had not been manufactured into new and different articles having distinctive name, character or use from that of a shell.<br\/><br\/>The application of labor to an article, either by hand or by mechanism, does not make the article necessarily a manufactured article, within the meaning of the term as used in said Tariff Law. The washing and scouring of wool, for example, does not make the result a \"manufacture'' of wool. The cleaning and ginning of cotton does not make the result a manufacture of cotton. The cleaning or threshing of rice does not make the cleaner or thresher a manufacturer.<br\/><br\/>It is not every employment of labor which will make the thing upon which it is employed a manufacture. A maker of ice cream, even on a large scale, for sale at wholesale and retail, is not a manufacturer. (New Orleans vs. Mannessier, 32 La. Ann., 1075.)<br\/><br\/>In the case of City vs. Coffee Company, <i>supra<\/i>, the court observed that the mammoth kitchen of a large hotel is not a manufactory, even though the kitchen yields products in which the identity of the articles from which they are made is almost entirely lost. The result is a product entirely different from its original.<br\/><br\/>The Treasurer of the United States, whose duty it is to give meaning to the tariff laws, has held in two cases that roasted coffee was not a \"manufacture.\" (Treasury Decision No. 15404.) Also that the roasting and grinding of coffee is not \"manufacture.\" (Treasury Decision No. 17579.)<br\/><br\/>Upon a full consideration of the facts and the law in the present case, and bearing in mind the purpose and objects of the provisions of the tariff law in question, we are of the opinion and so hold that roasting and grinding as to coffee, and grinding as to the spices involved in the present case, does not constitute \"manufacture,\" within the meaning of section 12 of the Tariff Law of 1909.<br\/><br\/>Therefore the judgment of the lower court is hereby affirmed, with costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Carson, Moreland<\/i>, and <i>Trent, JJ.,<\/i> concur.<\/div>",

As a result of these wounds, Santos was incapacitated for the performance of his ordinary  duties as  a laborer  for the period of twelve days.  The witnesses for the prosecution, including the complaining party, testified to the effect that on the night in question Antonio Santos was seated near a tienda when Dorotea Ramos came near and stated to him that she desired to talk with him about certain matters.  Santos declined to accede to this request on the ground, as he stated, that Dorotea's husband might be jealous of him and he did not want to be  caught talking with her in the streets at  night;  that on his refusal to comply with her request, Dorotea approached him and suddenly drew a bolo from under her apparel where it was concealed and inflicted the wounds.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, the appellant and her witnesses testify that as the appellant was going from her house to a certain Menda for the purpose of  making  a  small  purchase, she was met by Antonio Santos in a  dark place, somewhat isolated  from any buildings, and that Santos  immediately caught her by the arm and began to drag her off the street into an uninhabited place for the purpose of forcibly having illicit relations with her.

The trial court, after a careful examination of the testimony,made the following finding of facts:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The testimony of the woman  herself is  the  more acceptable, which is to the effect that the accused  Antonio Santos, upon  seeing her near an isolated place,  caught her  by the arm, tried to drag her to an obscure spot there to take advantage of her,  and that, in  order to  defend herself, it was necessary to wound  the said Santos  with the bolo that she carried.\" <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>We think the trial court reached a proper conclusion  as to how the trouble occurred; but we  cannot agree with his application of the law to these facts.<\/p>\n<p>Article 8 of the Penal Code reads:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The following are exempt from criminal liability:<\/p>\n<p align=\"center\">*       *      *       *       **      *<\/p>\n<p>\"4.  Anyone who acts in defense of his person or rights, provided that the following circumstances concur:<\/p>\n<p>\"(1)  Unlawful aggression;<\/p>\n<p>\"(2)  Reasonable necessity for the means employed  to prevent or repel it;<\/p>\n<p>\"(3)  Lack of sufficient provocation  on the part of the person defending himself.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>In the judgment appealed from,  the first and third  of these  circumstances were found in favor of the appellant, but the court said that  under the  testimony, and taking into consideration the  fact that the appellant, who is one of the most vigorous Filipinas, and Santos not being physically one of  the  strongest of  men,  it was  not reasonably necessary for the appellant to have used her bolo to repel the attack which was made upon her by Santos; that she could have escaped the consequences of this act by calling for help.<\/p>\n<p>Both the appellant and the offended party were married. The appellant was going along the street attending  to her own business, when  she was attacked by Santos.  He caught her by the arm and was forcibly taking her to a dark  place, off  the street, for the purpose, as we haye said, of having illicit relations with her.   She most seriously objected and  sought, by means of her own physical strength, to release herself, but  Santos persisted in his attempt.  It was then  that the appellant used her bolo.  She used it for the protection of her honor, and to repel this brutal attack which was made  upon  her.  Santos knew that the appellant  was a  married woman and living happily  with her husband. He also knew  that  if he ever could have carnal relations  with  her,  it  must be  by  force.  So  he deliberately planned to  commit one of the most heinous crimes known to our criminal law; and when he received the blows inflicted by the appellant with  her  bolo  which she carried, he was  then  carrying out his fiendish design  or plan.   Such injuries are  not by any means greater than  he deserved, and  the appellant was perfectly  justified, under the facts and circumstances, in using any kind of a weapon at  her command which was necessary to repel this attack, and to continue using it until she was able to free herself from Santos' clutches.   When a man becomes so debased as to  lose every instinct of manhood and  engages himself in the commission of so serious a crime, he  certainly stakes his life and liberty in his own hands, and  if he loses the latter or receives serious personal injuries, his loss is no greater than he deserves.   The  appellant is  therefore entitled to an  absolute acquittal upon  the ground  of  selfdefense.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment appealed from  is therefore  reversed and the appellant  ordered  released  from custody forthwith, with costs <em>de oficio.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em> Arellano, C.

It is alleged in the petition for probate that Maria Salomon died on the 7th day of November, 1908, in the pueblo  of Sinait,  Ilocos Sur, leaving a  last will and testament bearing date March 2, 1907.   Severo Agayan, Timotea Inoselda, Catalino Ragasa, and A. M.  Jimenez are alleged  to  have  been witnesses  to the  execution thereof. By the terms  of said will Pedro Barut received the larger part of decedent's property.<\/p>\n<p>The original will appears on page 3 of the record and is in the  Ilocano dialect.  Its  translation  into  Spanish appears at page 11.  After  disposing of her property the testatrix revoked all former wills by her made.  She also stated in said will that being unable to read or write, the same had been read to her by Ciriaco Concepcion and Timotea Inoselda and that she had instructed Severo Agayan to sign her name to it as testatrix.<\/p>\n<p>The probate of the will was contested  and opposed by a number of the relatives of the deceased on various grounds, among  them that  a  later will had been executed by the deceased.  The will referred to as being a later will is the one involved in case No. 6284 already referred to.  Proceedings for the probate of this later will were pending at the time.  The evidence of the proponents and of the opponents was taken by the court in  both cases  for the  purpose of considering them together.<\/p>\n<p>In  the case before us the learned probate court found that the will was not  entitled to probate upon  the  sole ground  that the handwriting  of the person who it is alleged signed the  name of the testatrix to the will for and on her behalf looked more like the handwriting of one of the other witnesses  to the will than that of the person whose handwriting it was alleged to be.   We  do  not believe  that the mere dissimilarity  in writing thus mentioned by the court is sufficient to overcome the uncontradicted testimony of all the  witnesses to  the will that the signature of the testatrix was written by Severo  Agayan at her request and in her presence and in the presence of all of the  witnesses to the will.  It is immaterial who writes the name of the testatrix  provided it is written  at her request  and in her presence and in the presence of all the witnesses to the execution of the will.<\/p>\n<p>The court seems, by  inference at least,  to have had in mind  that  under the law relating to  the execution of a will it is necessary  that the person who signs the name of the testatrix must afterwards sign his own name;  and that, in  view of the fact that, in the case at bar, the name signed below that of the testatrix as the person who signed her name, being,  from its appearance, not the same handwriting as that constituting the name of the testatrix, the will is accordingly invalid,  such fact indicating  that the person who signed the name  of the testatrix failed to sign his own.   We do  not believe that this  contention can be sustained.  Section 618 of the Code of Civil Procedure reads as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"No will,  except as provided in the  preceding section, shall be valid to pass any estate, real or personal, nor charge or affect the same,  unless it be in writing and signed by the testator,  or by the testator's name written  by some other person in his presence,  and  by his express direction, and attested and subscribed by three or more credible witnesses in the  presence of the testator and of each other.  *  *  *\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>This is  the important part of the section under the terms of which  the court holds that the person  who signs the name of the testator for him  must also sign  his own name. The remainder of the section reads:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The attestation  shall state the fact  that the testator signed the will,  or caused  it to be signed  by some  other person, at his express direction,  in  the  presence  of  three witnesses, and that they attested and subscribed  it in his presence  and  in  the presence of each other.  But the absence of such form of attestation shall not render the will invalid if it is proven that the will was in fact signed and attested as in this section provided.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>From these provisions  it  is entirely clear that,  with respect to the <em>validity<\/em> of the will, it is unimportant whether the person who writes the name of the testatrix signs his own or not.  The important thing is that it clearly appears that the name of the  testatrix was signed at her express direction  in the presence of three  witnesses and that they attested and subscribed it in her presence and in the presence of each  other.  That is all  the statute requires.  It may be wise as a practical matter that the  one who signs the testator's name signs also his own; but that is not essential to the <em>validity <\/em> of the will.   Whether one person or another signed  the name  of the  testatrix in this case is absolutely unimportant so far as the validity of her will is concerned.  The plain wording of the statute shows that the requirement laid down by the trial  court,  if it did lay it down, is absolutely unnecessary under the law; and the reasons underlying  the provisions of the statute relating to the execution of wills do not in any sense require such a provision.   From the standpoint  of language  it is an  impossibility to draw from the words of the law the  inference that the person who signs the name of the testator must sign his own name also.  The law requires only three witnesses to a will, not four.<\/p>\n<p>Nor is such requirement found in any other branch of the law.  The name of  a person who is unable to write may be signed by another by express direction to any instrument known  to the law.   There is no necessity whatever, so  far as  the  validity of the instrument  is concerned, for  the person who writes the name of the principal in the document to sign  his own name also.  As a matter  of policy it may be wise that he do so inasmuch as it would give such intimation as would enable a person proving the document to demonstrate more readily the execution by the  principal.  But as a matter of essential validity of the document, it is unnecessary.   The main thing to be established in the execution of the will is the signature of the testator.   If that signature is proved, whether it be written by himself or by another at his request, it is none the  less valid, and the fact of such signature can be proved as perfectly and as  completely when the person signing for the  principal omits to sign his own name as it  can when  he  actually signs.  To hold a will invalid for the  lack of the  signature of the person signing the name of the principal is, in the particular case, a complete abrogation  of the law of wills, as it  rejects and destroys a will which the statute expressly declares is valid.<\/p>\n<p>There have been cited three cases which it is  alleged are in opposition to the doctrine which we have herein laid down. They are <em>Ex parte<\/em> Santiago (4 Phil. Rep., 692), Ex parte Arcenas (4 Phil. Rep., 700), and Guison <em>vs.<\/em>  Concepcion (5 Phil. Rep., 551).  Not  one of  these  cases is in point. The headnote in the case last  above stated gives an indication of what all of the cases are and the question involved in each one of them.  It says:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The testatrix was not able to sign her name to the will, and she requested another person to sign it for her.  Instead of writing her name he wrote his own upon the will.  Held, That the will was not duly executed.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>All of the above  cases are  precisely  of  this  character. Every one of them  was a  case in which the  person who signed the will for the testator wrote his own  name to  the will instead  of 'writing that of the testator,  so that  the testator's name  nowhere appeared attached to the will as the one who executed it.  The case of  <em>Ex parte<\/em> Arcenas contains the  following paragraph:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Where  a testator does not  know how, or is unable  for any reason, to sign the will himself, it shall be signed in  the following manner: 'John Doe, by the testator, Richard Roe;' or in this form: 'By the testator.  John  Doe, Richard Roe.' All this must be written by the witness  signing  at the  request of the testator.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The only question for decision in that case,  as we have before stated, was presented by the fact that the person who was authorized  to sign the name of  the testator to  the will actually failed to sign such name but instead signed his own thereto.  The decision in  that case related only to that question.<\/p>\n<p>Aside from the presentation of an alleged  subsequent will the contestants in this case have set forth no reason whatever why the will involved  in the  present litigation should not be probated.  The  due  and legal execution of the will by the testatrix is clearly established by the proofs in this case.  Upon the facts, therefore, the will must  be probated. As to the defense of a subsequent will, that is resolved in case No. 6284 of which we have already spoken.  We there held that said later will was not  the will of the deceased.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment of the probate court must be and is hereby reversed and that court is directed to enter  an  order in  the usual form probating the will involved in this litigation and to proceed with such probate in accordance with law.<\/p>\n<em>Arellano, C.

Code of Civil Procedure does not expressly require that, when the testator or testatrix  is unable or does not know how to sign, the person who, in the presence and under the express direction  of either of them, writes in the  name  of the said testator or testatrix must also sign his own name thereto, it being sufficient for the validity of  the will that the said person so requested  to sign for the testator  or testatrix write the name of either in  his own  handwriting.<\/p>\n<p>Since this court began to decide cases with regard to the form, conditions and validity of wills executed in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, never has the specific point  just above mentioned been brought into question.  Now for the first time it is  affirmed in the majority opinion, written by the learned and distinguished Hon. Justice Moreland, that, not being required by the said code, the  signature of  the name of the person who, at the request of the testator or testatrix, writes the name of either of the latter to the will executed, is not necessary.<\/p>\n<p>Various and considerable in number have been the decisions rendered by this court in which, as will be seen further on, upon applying the said section 618 of the Code of Civil Procedure and requiring its  observance in  cases  where the testator or testatrix is unable or does not know how  to sign his or her  name, expressly prescribe the practical method of complying with the provisions of the law on the subject.   Among  these decisions several were written by various justices of this court, some of whom are no longer on this bench, as they have ceased  to hold such position.<\/p>\n<p>Paragraph 2  of the  syllabus  of case No. 2002, <em>Ex parte<\/em> Delfin Santiago,<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> concerning the probate  of a will,  reads  as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<em>Wills, authentication of<\/em>.

And  this fully complies with the  provisions of section  618 of the Act.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>It  is true that in none of the decisions above quoted was the rule established that the person who, at the request of the testator or testatrix,  signed the latter's or the former's name and surname to the will must affix his own signature; but it is no less true that, in prescribing the method in which the provisions of the said section 618 were  to be complied with, it was stated that, in order that a will so executed might be admitted to probate, it was  an indispensable requisite that  the  person  requested  to  sign in  place of the testator or testatrix, should write the latter's or the former's name and surname at the foot of the will in the presence and under the  direction of  either, as the case  might be, and should afterwards sign the instrument with his own  name and surname.<\/p>\n<p>The statement that the person who writes the name and surname of the testator or testatrix at the foot of the will should likewise affix his  own signature thereto, name and surname, though it be considered to be neither a rule nor a requisite necessary to follow for the  admission of the will to probate, yet it is unquestionable that, in inserting this last  above-mentioned detail in the aforesaid decisions,  it was  deemed to be a complement and integral part of the required conditions for the fulfillment of the provisions of the law.<\/p>\n<p>It is indisputable that the latter does not require the said subscription and signature of the person requested to affix to the will the name of the testator or testatrix who is not able to sign; but by stating  in the decisions  hereinabove quoted that the name and surname of the said person should be affixed by him, no act prohibited by law was recommended or  suggested, nor may such a detail  be  understood  to be contrary or opposed to the plain provisions thereof.<\/p>\n<p>In the preceding decision itself, it is recognized to be convenient and even prudent to require that the person requested to write the name of  the testator or  testatrix in the will also sign the instrument with his  own name and surname. This statement induces us to believe that, in behalf of the inhabitants of this country and for the sake of an upright administration  of justice, it should be maintained that such a signature must appear  in the will, since  no harm could accrue to anyone thereby and, on the contrary, it would serve as a guarantee of the certainty of the act performed and also might eliminate some possible  cause of controversy between  the  interested parties.<\/p>\n<p>The undersigned feels it his duty to admit that, though convinced of the complete repeal of article 695 of the Civil Code and,  while  he concedes that, in the examination and qualification of a will  for the purpose of its probate, one has but to abide by the provisions of  the said section 618 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the sole  law applicable in the matter, yet, perhaps imbued with and strongly impelled by a traditional conception of the laws  which he has known since his youth, relative to the form of execution of testaments, he believed it to be a very natural and common sense requisite that the signature, with his  own name and surname, of the person requested to write  in the will the name and surname of the testator or  testatrix should form a part of the provisions  of the aforementioned  section  618. He undoubtedly thought, perhaps mistakenly, that such a requisite of the signature of the person  before referred to\u2014a requisite deemed to be convenient and prudent in the majority opinion\u2014formed a part of the provisions of the law, since the latter contains nothing  that  prohibits it.  The aforementioned different decisions were drawn  up  in  the form in which they appear, and signed without dissent by all the justices of the court on various dates.  None of them hesitated to sign the decisions, notwithstanding that it was expressly held  therein that the person above mentioned should, besides  writing in the will the name and surname of  the testator  or testatrix, also sign the  said instrument with his own name and surname.<\/p>\n<p>Without being understood to criticise  the provision contained in the said section 618 of the Code of Civil Procedure, it will not be superfluous to mention that the system adopted in this section is the same as was in vogue under the former laws  that governed in  these  Islands, with  respect to witnesses who were not able or did not  know how to sign their  testimony given  in  criminal or civil  cases, in  which event any person at all might write the name and surname of the witness who was unable or did not  know how to sign, at the foot of his deposition, where a cross was then drawn, and, this done,  it was considered that the instrument had been signed by the witness, though it is true that all these formalities were performed before the judge and the clerk or  secretary of the court, which  thereupon certified that such procedure was had in accordance with the law.<\/p>\n<p>The difference is that in the will, pursuant to section 618 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the person who writes the name and surname of the testator or testatrix does so by the order and express direction of the one  or of the other, and this fact must be recorded in the will; but in the matter of the signature of a deposition, the witness, who could not or  did not know how to sign, did not need to  designate anyone to write the  deponent's name and surname,  and in practice the witness merely made a cross beside his name and surname, written by whomever it be.<\/p>\n<p>With regard to the execution of wills in accordance with the provisions of previous statutes, among them those of the Civil Code, the person or witness requested by the testator or testatrix who was not able or did not know how to sign, authenticated  the will by signing it with his own name and surname, preceded by the words \"at the request of the testator or testatrix.\"  Paragraph 2 of article 6\u00a75 of the Civil  Code contains the following  provisions bearing on the subject:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Should the testator declare that he does  not know how, or is  not able  to sign, one of the attesting witnesses or another person shall do so for him at his request, the notary certifying thereto.  This shall also be done if any one of the witnesses can not sign.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>So that, prior to the  enforcement in this country in 1901 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the procedure prescribed by the old laws with  respect  to the signing of  a will  by  a testator or testatrix who did not know how or  who could not sign, consisted in that  the person  appointed  and requested by the testator or testatrix to sign in  his or her stead, such fact being recorded in the will,  merely affixed at the bottom of the  will and after the words \"at the request of the testator,\" his own name, surname and paraph.<\/p>\n<p>It is not at all strange that the attorneys of this country, imbued with and inspired by these legal provisions, which, it may be said, are traditional to them in the ideas they have formed of the existing  laws in the matter of procedure in compliance therewith as regards the execution  and signing of a will,  should have  believed that, after the name and surname of the testator or testatrix had been written at the foot of the will, the person  who signed the  instrument in the manner mentioned should likewise sign the same with his own name and surname.<\/p>\n<p>If in various decisions, it has been  indicated that the person who, under the express direction of the testator or testatrix,  wrote  the latter's or the former's name  and surname, should also sign the will with his own name and surname,  and  since this suggestion  is  not opposed  or contrary to the law, the undersigned is of opinion that it      ought  not  to be modified or amended, but that, on  the contrary, it should be maintained as a requisite established by the jurisprudence  of  this court, inasmuch as such a requisite is not.contrary to law, to public order, or to good custom, is in consonance with a tradition of this country, does not prejudice the testator  nor  those interested in an inheritance,  and,  on  the  contrary,  constitutes another guarantee of the truth and authenticity of the  letters with which  the name and surname of the testator  or testatrix are written,  in  accordance  with his or  her desire as  expressed in the will.<\/p>\n<p>Even though the requisites referred to were not recognized in jurisprudence and were unsupported by any legal doctrine whatever, yet, since it is in harmony with the juridical usages  and customs observed in this country, it  ought, in the humble opinion of the writer, to be maintained for the benefit  of the inhabitants of the Islands and for the sake of a good administration of justice, because it is not a question of a dangerous innovation or of one prejudicial to the public good, but a matter of the observance  of a convenient, if not a necessary detail, introduced by the jurisprudence of the courts and which in the present case has filled a vacancy left by  the positive written law.<\/p>\nThe foregoing considerations, which perhaps have not the support of better premises, but, in the opinion of the undersigned,  are conducive to the realization of the purposes of justice, have impelled him to believe that the  proposition should be enforced that the witness requested or invited by the testator or testatrix to write his or her name to the will, should also subscribe the instrument by signing thereto his own name and surname; and therefore, with  the proper finding  in this sense, and a  reversal of the  judgment appealed from,  that the  court below should be  ordered  to proceed with the  probate of the will of the decedent, Maria Salomon, in  accordance with the law.<br\/>\n<br\/>\n<br\/>\n<hr align=\"left\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/>\n<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> Not published.\n<p><sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> 4 Phil.

THE MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.\n  <br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\"><p>This case is before us on appeal by the counsel for The Manila Railroad Company from a judgment  rendered by the Honorable Isidro Paredes, judge.<\/p>\n<p>In a written complaint filed with the  Court of First Instance of Pangasinan, on June 23, 1909, the plaintiff Manuela Rosario set forth: That  she was the widow of Joaquin Fontanilla, who died in the pueblo of Alava, Pangasinan, on the 8th of January of the year aforesaid, and the guardian <em>ad  litem<\/em>  of  the other plaintiffs, who were  the legitimate children of herself and the said Fontanilla, upon whose work and pay, prior to his death, the plaintiffs all depended for their support; that the deceased Fontanilla, prior to  January 8, 1909, was  in the service of the defendant company and was foreman  over  a number of laborers who  were working on the construction of a railroad and were engaged in loading and unloading stone and gravel upon and from cars and trains under the control of the said company, its engine driver, train dispatcher, and superintendent; that on said date the cars and trains upon and from which stone and gravel were being loaded and unloaded by the workmen directed by Fontanilla, were, by order of the train dispatchers,  agents, and superintendent of the said company, removed to other points of the railroad line, and although the foreman Fontanilla discharged his duties with diligence and care, the car on  which  he was riding collided, during the movement of the  cars and trains, with another car on the track; that, as a result of the heavy shock and violent collision between the two  cars, Fontanilla fell from the car and the wheels thereof passed over his body, crushing some of his bones and causing his instant death; that said accident occurred through the negligence and  carelessness of the engine driver, superintendent, and  train dispatcher of the company, since the  car and  train in which Fontanilla was riding, in the performance of his duties, were being drawn by  a locomotive belonging to the defendant  company and on arrival at a grade where the rails were not on a level, the engineer who was driving the locomotive stopped the same, letting loose the car  and train in which Fontanilla, was riding, and, as a result thereof, the said car  ran down the incline with great rapidity and collided with another loaded car; that this would not have occurred if the rails had been on a level, or if the car had  remained coupled  to the locomotive, or if the engineer of the  latter  had stopped the locomotive at a place where there was no declivity or grade; that the engineer acted negligently and carelessly by his failure to couple the said  car to the locomotive which was drawing it, when he  knew that the car, being uncoupled from the  locomotive,  would  start to run down the slope, whereby he failed to perform his duty,  as likewise did the other employees of the company by permitting the locomotive to stop in the said place, thus causing the car to run by its own momentum and cause the collision with the other loaded car, when they should have foreseen that, by the cars running down the grade, the said collision would occur; that it was to be believed that the company's engine driver and train  dispatcher did not know their duties and had neither the ability nor the experience required for the service to which they were assigned and for directing the movements and superintendence of cars, trains, and  locomotives; and that;  as a result of what occurred, the defendants suffered damages in the amount of P2,500, by the  death of Joaquin Fontanilla.  The plaintiffs  therefore prayed  the court to render judgment in their behalf for the said sum, and for the costs. The demurrer to the complaint having been overruled by an order of August 12, 1909, and exception thereto taken by the defendant party, the latter, by a writing  of the 21st of the same month, set forth that it admitted the truth of the allegation contained in the  second paragraph of the complaint, but made a general and specific denial of each and all of the allegations of each and  all the other paragraphs of the complaint, and, as  a  special defense, alleged that the defendant company, at  all times and places,  had employed all  due diligence in its operations and labors, both  as regarded its personnel and its' material, and had endeavored to avoid accidents such as might injure any of its employees or laborers; that the accident suffered by Fontanilla and which occasioned his death,  was due to his own negligence, carelessness, and imprudence, and that the defendant company  was not culpable.  The latter, therefore, asked that judgment be pronounced in  its favor, by absolving it from the, complaint and sentencing the plaintiffs to the payment  of the costs.<\/p>\n<p>On  February 17,  1910, the plaintiff Manuela Rosario filed a motion for the withdrawal of her action, in so far as  it concerned herself.<\/p>\n<p>Upon a motion presented by the  defendant on the  same date, and with the authorization of the court,  the defendant company filed  an additional  answer in which it alleged that the plaintiff Rosario could in no wise maintain an action for damages on account of the  death of her  husband, for the reason that she herself had admitted, under oath and in a public document, that the accident was due to the deceased's own imprudence; and that the defendant was in no way to blame for what had occurred.<\/p>\n<p>On March 17, 1910,  counsel for  the defendant presented a new motion  wherein it  alleged  that, since  the  plaintiff Rosario had withdrawn her action, in so far as it concerned her\u2014which implied an admission of the allegation relative to the argument advanced that she could not maintain any action whatever for damages against the railroad company on account of her having admitted  that the accident, to wit, the death of her husband, was  due to the deceased's  imprudence\u2014it was proper to dismiss this action, following the decision in the case of Naval <em>vs.<\/em> Enriquez (3 Phil. Rep., 669)  counsel prayed that, as a preliminary  matter,  his motion be granted, and the court, by an order of March 22, dismissed the suit, with the costs in favor of the defendant company.<\/p>\n<p>On March 29, counsel for the  plaintiffs moved the court to reconsider the case  dismissed by a previous order, and, on the same date,  made written motion that an  exception be entered for his clients  against the said  order of dismissal; and  by another writing of the  30th of the same monthv requested a reopening of the case and a reconsideration of the motion praying for the annulment of the said order of dismissal.  Both these motions were overruled by the court, in an order issued on April 9, to which ruling counsel for the plaintiffs excepted.<\/p>\n<p>By a writing of May  10, presented to the court and subscribed by both parties, the latter stated that they had agreed to a rehearing of this case and that all  the relevant evidence which the  parties might present should  be  admitted.   This agreement  was approved by an order  of August 10, 1910.<\/p>\n<p>After a hearing of the case and the  introduction of testimony by both parties, the court, on the 24th of August of the same year, rendered judgment  by sentencing the defendant, The Manila Railroad Company, to pay to the plaintiffs the sum of P2,500 and the costs.  To this judgment counsel for the defendant took  exception and, in writing, moved for its annulment and the holding of a new  trial, which motion was overruled by an order of September 1, to which an exception was taken and the proper bill of exceptions  filed, certified, approved, and forwarded to the  clerk of this court.<\/p>\n<p>The action  in this case was brought for the purpose of obtaining damages, in behalf of the six children of Joaquin Fontanilla,  a foreman  in  the service of the corporation known  as  The Manila Railroad  Company,  who died on January 8, 1909, as a result of falling from and being run over by one of the open cars belonging to the defendant and used for hauling stone and gravel.  The accident was caused by the car colliding with another loaded car, after the said open cars had run, on their own momentum, down a grade at a place called Cabaoanan, of  the  pueblo of Alava,  Pangasinan, due to their having been, by order of the engineer who was driving the locomotive, uncoupled from the said engine.   The  lumbar vertebrae  and  floating  ribs of the deceased were broken.<\/p>\n<p>At  the beginning, suit was brought by Manuela Rosario, the widow  of the  unfortunate Fontanilla and guardian <em>ad litem<\/em>  of their children, but, seven months and some  days afterwards,  while  the litigation  was still  pending, counsel for the said plaintiff presented  a written motion for the withdrawal  of the action in so far as his client was concerned, and the defendant, on being informed thereof, prayed for the dismissal of the complaint in view of the fact jbhat the plaintiff had admitted, in a  public document, that the accident  which caused her husband's death was occasioned by the deceased's own imprudence, as she herself declared under oath, and therefore withdrew her action.  This  petition was granted by an order of March 22,1910; but, through an  agreement reached between both parties,  the trial was reopened with respect to the minor children of the deceased Fontanilla.<\/p>\n<p>The document above cited, executed by Manuela Rosario, reads as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I, Manuela Rosario y Urbano, widow of the deceased Joaquin Fontanilla, 39 years of age and a resident of the municipality of Alava, Province of Pangasinan, P. I., after taking oath in legal form, declare:  (1) That  on the eighth day of the present month, at the hour of 10 minutes to 4 o'clock in the afternoon, my deceased husband, Joaquin Fontanilla, who was in the employ of the Manila Railroad Company in the capacity of foreman, jumped from one of the cars of the construction train, on the Camp One line of the said company, lost his balance on striking the ground, and rolled under the wheels of another car which passed over him and caused his immediate death, as shown by the official report made by the Cabaoanan station master; (2) That the Manila Railroad Company, in consideration of the services rendered by the deceased and the neediness of his  widow and children, brought about by the deceased's carelessness and negligence, the said  company being  in no manner responsible for this misfortune, decided to  pay  us a gratuity of P100 (one hundred pesos) Philippine currency, which I, Manuela Rosario y Urbano, his widow, accept in my name and in that of my minor children, in the nature, as aforesaid, of a gratuity, and not as an indemnity,  since there is  no reason for the latter,  as the deceased met hie death solely by  his own fault; and (3) That, in accordance with  the foregoing, we deem this matter to be closed and promise the Manila Railroad Company that we shall make no other claim nor present any judicial complaint in any form  whatever, with reference thereto, the affair being hereby terminated. In witness whereof, I sign this affidavit, in San Fabian, this 22d  day  of January, 1909\u2014Manuela  Rosario.\u2014Signed. Signed and sworn to before me, this 22d day of January, 1909.  The affiant did  not  exhibit  to me  her  certificate oi registration, on account of her being exempt from this tax by reason of her sex.\u2014Before me: Mariano Legaspi, notary public.\u2014My appointment expires on January 1, 1910.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>From the facts which are held in the judgment to have been proven, it is concluded that, on the aforesaid date of January 8,  1909, when the accident occurred which caused the death of Joaquin Fontanilla, he  was  occupying the position.of  foreman of laborers, in the service of the said railroad company, at a semimonthly salary of P8.50; that, on the date  mentioned, he arrived with a gang of workmen, all being aboard four  cars  which had come from a place north of Calasiao and which were loaded with gravel to be used in  the company's work; that when the loaded cars stopped on the track at a place where there is a grade running from north to south, they were, by order of the engineer, uncoupled from the locomotive  which  had been drawing them, this maneuver not being noticed  by the foreman and workmen; that by reason of this stop  and  uncoupling, the four cars, in the next to the last of which were seated the foreman and workmen, suddenly moved rapidly backwards down the grade until they met  and  collided with another car, loaded with stone,  which was standing at a point below the incline; that, as a  result of  the shock,  Fontanilla was thrown out  and fell to  the ground, and the car from which he fell passed over his body; that the post-mortem  examination disclosed that four of  the lumbar vertebrae  and two floating ribs were broken, wherefore the injured man must have died immediately; that Fontanilla, at his death, left a widow, Manuela Rosario, and six minor children, the eldest of which was 19 years old,  all of whom subsisted and depended on the deceased's meager  salary; and that when the cars were running backwards, it was not possible to stop them by applying the brakes, because the latter were in bad condition and would not work,  and  notwithstanding that Fontanilla, on the morning of that day, reported that such a defect existed, the notice was  disregarded and the cars were coupled to the locomotive for the service aforementioned.<\/p>\n<p>The trial judge, in consideration of the facts duly proved by the testimony of witnesses, held that the accident, whereby Joaquin Fontanilla lost his life, was due to a defect in the condition of the machinery employed by the defendant company in its business, and also to the fault, carelessness and  negligence of the said company and of its employees.<\/p>\n<p>The Act applicable to the case, and on the provisions of which the judgment was based, is No. 1874,  section 2 of which reads:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"If, as the result of the negligence of the  employer or that of a person for whose negligence the employer is liable under the provisions of section  one, an employee  is killed or dies by reason  of injuries received, his widow, or legal heirs,  or next of kin who at the  time of his death  were dependent upon his wages for support, shall have a right of action for damages against the employer.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The third paragraph  of  section 3  of the same  Act precribes:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The amount of damages which  may be awarded in such action, if damages for his death  are  awarded under the provisions of section two, shall  not be less than five hundred pesos nor more than two thousand five hundred pesos for both the injury and the  death.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Immediately after the accident the company was informed thereof;  and the  plaintiff's complaint or claim was filed in the court of Pangasinan on June 23 of the same year, 1909;  so all the provisions of  section 4 of the  said Act were complied with.<\/p>\n<p>Manuela Rosario, the  widow of the  deceased  Joaquin Fontanilla, having withdrawn her action, her rights  and personality have been  set aside.   The plaintiff  has continued this suit in the name and in representation of her minor children, as the successors and heirs of her deceased husband, in the exercise of the right conferred upon them by the aforecited  Act No. 1874, because of the  death of their father,  due to the negligence of the defendant corporation  and of its employees.  It is unnecessary to  discuss the question of the validity and force of the affidavit apparently  made  by  the  said widow and  contained in the  above-quoted notarial  instrument, inasmuch as the statements made by her in the said document can not affect the rights and interests of her minor children.  These were expressly recognized in the judgment appealed from.<\/p>\n<p>Even  though it were  conceded that the above-quoted notarial  instrument was of the nature  of a public document, as it  was  authenticated by  a notary,  yet merely because this officer attested that Manuela Rosario made before him the statements contained in the said  affidavit, the said instrument is of but slight juridical value; such documents are always of less probatory value than the testimony of witnesses.  The said affidavit could  operate as proof, according to article  1218 of the  Civil Code, even against third parties with respect to the facts giving rise to and the date of its execution, but such notarial instrument can hot operate as conclusive proof against the minor children  represented in this  litigation by the maker of that instrument, because the children had not acquired the right to demand the indemnity in their character as successors of their  mother Rosario, who is still living,  but as the children and heirs of the deceased Joaquin Fontanilla, killed as the result of an accident.  If Manuela Rosario had not been alive on the date of said accident, the orphans, the children  of the  deceased,  would unquestionably have been entitled to demand the indemnity in  question,  through a guardian.<\/p>\n<p>Section 348 of the Code of Civil Procedure, defining affidavits and depositions, says that an affidavit is a written declaration under oath, made without notice to the adverse party and the  section  enumerates the instances in  which such documents may properly be used.   The law only concedes them the character of  prima facie  evidence of the facts stated  therein, but such evidence  is susceptible of impeachment, since, according to the' doctrine established in the decision of the supreme court of  Spain, of July 13, 1899, as  a general rule, all documents attest the facts that are the origin of and the date of their execution, but do not attest the veracity of the statements therein made.<\/p>\n<p>Even though the  statements made in the said notarial instrument  expressed a  contract entered  into  between Manuela Rosario and the defendant corporation, the children had  by the said Rosario and the deceased Fontanilla were  not  bound with respect to the damages claimed in this suit,  inasmuch  as the former, as the latter's  widow, could have waived her right to be indemnified on account of the accidental death of her husband,  but she did not have the authority, either as the  mother or as the natural guardian  of  her minor children,  to waive, in the  latter's name, their right to claim the said indemnity.  Once such right  was acquired by the death of the children's father, caused by the negligence of the defendant  corporation and some  of its employees, it became incorporated within the property and interests of the said minors which must be cared for and preserved by their parents  or guardians.<\/p>\n<p>Article  164 of the  Civil  Code prescribes:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The father,  or the mother in a proper case,  can riot alienate the  real property of the child,  the usufruct or administration of which belongs to them, nor encumber the same, except for sufficient reasons of utility or necessity, and after authorization from the judge  of the domicile, hearing the  department  of public prosecution, etc.\"<\/p>\n<p>Article  269 of the same code provides:<\/p>\n<p>\"The guardian  requires the  authority of  the  family council:<\/p>\n<p align=\"center\">*       *       *       *      *       *      *<\/p>\n<p>\"5.  To  alienate  or encumber the  property constituting the capital of minors or incapacitated persons, or to make contracts or execute  instruments subject to record.<\/p>\n<p align=\"center\">*       *       *       *       *      *\t  *<\/p>\n<p>\"12. To compromise and submit to arbitration the questions in which the minor or  incapacitated person may be interested.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Article  275 of the said code provides:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Guardians are forbidden\u2014<\/p>\n<p>\"1. To give or renounce things or rights belonging to the minor or incapacitated person.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Even  with the modifications produced  by the Code of Civil Procedure  in  some articles of the  Civil Code,  and Manuela Rosario's having declared in her sworn statement that she did  not renounce any right pertaining to her children, it is not proper to conclude that, by reason of the statements made by her in  the said notarial instrument, the right to the indemnity claimed in the present suit may be deemed to have been renounced by the plaintift minors. The character of natural guardian, with which Manuela Rosario, the  mother of the plaintiff minors, is vested, does not confer upon her a right to dispose of  her children's property or to renounce in their name the right to indemnity accorded them by law, for section 553 of the Code of Civil Procedure, although it  prescribes  that  the father, or, in case of his death or legal disability, the  mother, of a minor chiTd, is to be deemed  the natural  guardian,  and as such is entitled to the custody,  and charged  with the care and education of the minor,  yet this right  is  not extended to include the latter's property, unless so ordered by the court; and the record does not show that Manuela Rosario  was authorized freely to dispose  of the property and rights of her minor children.   Meanwhile parents and guardians of minors are expressly forbidden  to sell  the property, transfer the rights or compromise the interests of their children or wards, without previous judicial authorization, a prohibition introduced  into the  law for  the benefit  of minors who might be defrauded  even by their parents and  guardians;   Therefore, the statements  made by Manuela Rosario, in the off-mentioned  notarial instrument, can In no wise affect the rights of her minor children in the present suit.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover,  the  said statements of Manuela Rosario  can in no manner prejudice  the rights and  interests of  her minor children, and the close relationship between her and her  children, does  not constitute  the  particular relation referred to by section 277 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which declares that the rights of a,party can not be prejudiced by the declaration, act or omission of another.<\/p>\n<p>If the only evidence which the defendant party was  unable  to  produce  (as the court refused to suspend  the hearing  of  this case and postpone the suit until another date), was  the testimony of the notary who drew up and authenticated the said notarial instrument, which evidence the defense wished to produce  because Maiiuela Rosario did not assert that she executed  or signed the  said instrument,  inasmuch  as  the said Rosario withdrew  her complaint, and  it having been shown that  neither the  sworn statements  contained in  the notarial instrument, nor  the latter  itself&gt; can in any wise  affect the  rights  of  the plaintiff  minors,  in  whose  name their  mother was not authorized to renounce any of such rights, it is clear that the trial judge  did  not incur the errors assigned to the judgment appealed from.<\/p>\n<p>For the  reasons aforestated,  and tjie  plaintiff minors having an unquestionable right to the indemnity claimed, it is,  in  our opinion, proper to affirm, and we do hereby affirm, the  said  judgment,  with  the costs against  the appellant.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

Evangelista, was convicted in the Court of First Instance of Manila of the crime of arson and was sentenced, under article 557, paragraph 4, of the Penal Code, to three years and seven months of <i>presidio correccional<\/i>, and to pay the costs of the action.<br\/><br\/>Ramona R. Evangelista was the tenant of a portion of a building situated on Garriedo Street, Manila, and used the ground floor for a store where were sold hats and various other articles, while the\u00a0 upper floor was used as living quarters for herself and a number of student boarders.\u00a0 On June 2, 1912, at 7.01 p. m., the fire department answered an alarm of fire which proved to be in that part of the building occupied by the appellant.\u00a0 At the time the firemen arrived, dense black smoke\u00a0 was issuing from under the eaves of the\u00a0 building, and the fumes of burning coal oil were plainly\u00a0 discernible.\u00a0 The fire originated in the second floor of the building in the appellant's living quarters.\u00a0 Before the fire was finally extinguished, the building was damaged, according to the testimony of record, in the amount of P10,562.<br\/><br\/>The acting chief of the fire department testified that the fire could not have been burning more than three or four minutes when he arrived.\u00a0 He declared positively that the fire could not have gained the headway it had or caused the damage it did if coal oil had not been used, and that the whole place appeared to have been saturated with coal oil.<br\/><br\/>Three insurance policies taken out by the appellant were introduced by the prosecution.\u00a0 One for P1,000'was simply a renewal of a former policy, the renewal dating from December 20, 1911.\u00a0 Another, written by the same company, in the amount of P5,000, was dated May 22, 1912.\u00a0 The third, in another company, was dated May 21, 1912, and was also for P5,000.\u00a0 Although the policy issued May 22 contained a condition that policies with other companies must be declared and inserted on its face, no mention appears of the one issued the preceding day.<br\/><br\/>An agent of the company which issued the insurance policy for P5,000 dated the 21st of May testified that he went to the store and made an inspection of the contents, and at that time there was not over P2,000 or P3,000 worth of goods, including the wardrobes; but as the appellant stated that there were more goods coming to the store very soon, he agreed to make the policy for P5,000.<br\/><br\/>At the date of the fire the appellant was moving her store and personal effects to No. 329 Ronquillo.\u00a0 The administrator of the Tuason estate, of which the burned building was a part, testified that the appellant owed the estate Pl,392 for\u00a0 rent; that he had given her notice a month or two before the fire occurred to move about June; that no date was fixed by him but the appellant informed him that she would leave the house about June.<br\/><br\/>Jose Bello testified that he had been\u00a0 employed by the appellant as a clerk in the store up to the time of the fire.\u00a0 He testified that he was working in the store on the morning of June 2; that the appellant instructed him to put a number of valuable hats in a box, as she was going to send them to a friend to sell; that he did as he was instructed, and that the box was removed by a servant to the house at 329 Ronquillo.\u00a0 Witness stated that these were the only valuable hats left in the store; that the trunks of the students who were boarding with the appellant had been removed to the new place previous to June 2, as well as furniture and cooking utensils; and that on Sunday some more trunks and other things were taken to the new place.\u00a0 He testified that no new stock of goods had been brought to the store after the insurance policies dated May 21 and 22 had been issued.<br\/><br\/>Detective Perceival stated that on the morning after the fire he found in the living quarters upstairs an iron bed, a wardrobe, a box, and an old bed, all practically burned up; an old leather box containing some papers of no importance; and one or two pieces of clothing.\u00a0 The inside of the wardrobe was not burned and there was nothing in it.<br\/><br\/>The defendant testified that the goods she had removed from the house were those which she sold to Americans at the end of every month; that she kept her insurance policies at her aunt's house.<br\/><br\/>Juan Evangelista, son of the appellant, testified that he was a resident of 825 (329) Ronquillo; that formerly he resided at 325 Carriedo; that he moved from the latter place just previous to the fire on June 2; that all the boarders and the servants had also moved, leaving only his father and mother at the place on Carriedo.<br\/><br\/>The acting chief of the fire department testified that on May 31, at 6.81 a. m. an alarm was turned in for a fire which proved to be in the rear of a piano store adjacent to that part of the building occupied by the appellant.\u00a0 The fire burned a hole through a door which opened into a court or passageway to which access could also be had through a similar door on the premises of the appellant.\u00a0 The fire chief directed his assistant to look for evidences of incendiarism, and shortly after his assistant came back saying:\u00a0 \"Chief, here are four bottles with some coal oil in them yet.\"\u00a0 The four bottles were placed upon a piano and the case turned over to the Secret Service Bureau.\u00a0 Exception was taken to the remark made to the fire chief by his assistant as being hearsay.\u00a0 This exception was overruled and counsel for the appellant assigns this as error.\u00a0 As the chief's assistant also testified in this case, and stated that he found four pint bottles with a few drops of kerosene in them just back of the door which was burned by the fire, the remark in question was unnecessary to establish the fact that the assistant chief, acting upon the instructions received from his superior, found four pint bottles with kerosene in them, and that he brought these bottles to the fire chief, who placed them on a piano and turned the case over to the police department.\u00a0\u00a0 The error in admitting the remark, if error at all, was harmless and did not prejudice the rights of the defendant.<br\/><br\/>Teodorico Fungo, who was the servant of the appellant at the time\u00a0 of this first fire, testified that early on that morning, while boiling some milk, the appellant ordered him to go downstairs\u00a0 and light some papers in a box standing in the court just between the appellant's door and the door to the piano store.\u00a0 Witness refused to do so, and then saw the appellant go downstairs with a bottle of petroleum and saturate the papers in the box with the petroleum, after which she came back upstairs and sent him out to purchase four centavos worth of petroleum.\u00a0 Upon his return she took the petroleum from him and went downstairs.\u00a0 Pretty soon he heard people downstairs crying, \"Fire, fire,\" and then he heard the appellant saying the same thing to her son.\u00a0 Witness then wrapped up his things and left the house, The testimony of this witness was objected to on the ground that at the time of the trial he was living at the house of a member of the city secret-service force who assisted in the investigation of the origin of the fire occurring on June 2, without paying for his accommodations.\u00a0 This witness, however, testified that he was washing dishes at this house, and evidently he was acting as a servant.\u00a0 In any event, this fact would not affect his competency as a witness.\u00a0 It was established by indisputable evidence that a fire occurred as\u00a0 stated above on May 31, and that unmistakable evidences of incendiarism were found by the fire department.<br\/><br\/>The defense objected to the introduction of all evidence relative to the fire of May 31 as incompetent and\u00a0 not the fire charged in the information.\u00a0 While it was not the fire charged in the information, and does not by any means amount to direct evidence against the accused, it was competent to prove the intent of the accused in setting the fire which was charged in the information.<br\/><br\/>In People <i>vs<\/i>. Shainwold (51 Cal., 468), the court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"On a trial for arson, the prosecution may prove that the prisoner had attempted to set fire to the house on a day previous to the burning alleged in the indictment, for the purpose of showing the intent of the prisoner in subsequently setting fire to the house.\"<\/blockquote>In Knights <i>vs<\/i>. State (58 Neb., 225; 78 N. W., 508), the court said:\u00a0 \"Where a person is charged with the commission of a specific crime, testimony may be received of other similar acts, committed about the same time, for the purpose only of establishing the criminal intent of the accused.\"<br\/><br\/>And in People <i>vs<\/i>. Lattimore (86 Cal., 403; 24 Pac, 1091), a similar ruling was made, when the court said that \"evidence tending to show that defendant started the former fire was admissible to prove intent.\"\u00a0 This principle has been applied by the courts of many jurisdictions.\u00a0 (3 Cyc, 1007; 1 Wigmore on Evidence, \u00a7\u00a7 303, 354.)\u00a0 There was no error in receiving the evidence as to the fire occurring on May 31 to show intent.<br\/><br\/>The accused\u00a0 appeared at the scene of the fire on the morning of June 3, and Detective Perceival, who had been detailed to make an investigation of the fire, after a few minutes conversation with her, sent her to the police station in company with the witness Jose Bello.\u00a0 She remained at the police station all day until about 8 o'clock that evening, when she confessed to having started the fire, assigning as her reason that she was heavily in debt and the only way she could see to get out of debt was to raise her insurance and then set fire to the place, Perceival testified that the appellant gave her confession in detail.\u00a0 It is not denied that this confession was made.\u00a0 But counsel assigns as error on this appeal that it should not have been admitted because it was involuntary by reason of force, intimidation, etc., used in extorting it.<br\/><br\/>It is admitted that the accused was detained at the police station from about 10 o'clock in the morning until 3 o'clock at night; that from the time she arrived until after office hours at 5.30 in the evening she was held in the waiting room, which was furnished with \"hard-seated chairs;\" that she was then taken into the office of the chief of the secret service and remained there until 8 o'clock, when she made her confession; that during the day she was not allowed to talk to any member of her family; and that the detective told her she \"had better tell the truth.\"\u00a0 The defendant herself further testified that Perceival and Dizon (another detective) were the only persons who talked to her during the afternoon; that they both told her to admit that she had started the fire, and said if she would do so she would only have to pay a fine and would then be set free; that if she did not admit having started the fire, she would have to go to jail for twenty years; that she did not have anything to eat; and that about 8 o'clock that evening she could hardly remember anything as she was shaking and trembling and did not know what she was doing.\u00a0 On cross-examination she admitted that she was offered food at noon and the evening also, but said that she did not eat any of it.\u00a0 She further stated that Perceival was sitting by her side a considerable portion of the afternoon and nudging her and saying: \"Tell the truth; tell the truth.\"\u00a0 Perceival and Dizon\u00a0 testified in rebuttal that the defendant did eat while she was detained at the police station; that Perceival did not nudge her or mistreat her in any way, and that no promises of leniency or threats of imprisonment were made to her.\u00a0 The trial court, who could observe the witnesses and their demeanor and bearing on the stand, was in a much better position to estimate the value of this contradictory testimony than are we.\u00a0 But another circumstance is before us which greatly weakens the testimony of the defendant on this point.\u00a0 Perceival testified that immediately upon her confession of guilt he sent for the chief of the secret service; that while the chief was there the then attorney of the defendant also came in; that he asked her in the presence of these two gentlemen if anything had been done to her and, if so, to tell them about it; and finally that her attorney himself asked her this question and she replied, \"no; that he (the detective) had treated her as though he was her son.\"\u00a0 Under these circumstances, the lower court did not credit her statements in these respects, and we cannot say that there was error in so doing.<br\/><br\/>Counsel on this\u00a0 appeal, however, strongly insists that the facts that she was sitting on a \"hard-seated chair\" all day and that at several times during the day Perceival came to her and talked to her about the evidence he had\u00a0 against her and told her \"she had better tell the truth\" should be considered as sufficient to render the confession involuntary.\u00a0 So far as her being detained in the waiting room which was furnished with \"hardseated chairs\" is concerned, we fail to perceive any degree of torture or mistreatment.\u00a0 It is true that she was deprived of her liberty and was held as a suspicious person, which was not at all a pleasant experience.\u00a0 But her treatment in this respect was certainly not more rigorous than that to\u00a0 which all prisoners must submit.\u00a0 The positive statement is accredited to the defendant that she was well treated by the detective.\u00a0 It is not denied that she made this statement, nor that it was made in the presence of her then attorney.\u00a0 The latter could certainly have testified to the truth or falsity of this statement, and as to her physical condition at the time it was made.\u00a0 But he was not called as a witness.\u00a0 Detective Perceival testified on this point that she knew what she was saying in making her confession, but that she appeared to be ashamed and broken up, and that she cried and begged for mercy from her lawyer after he arrived.<br\/><br\/>Nor was the admonition of Perceival that she had better tell the truth in the nature of a threat.\u00a0 In Huffman <i>vs<\/i>. State (130 Ala., 89;\u00a0 30 So., 394), it was held that the facts that the\u00a0 accused was urged to tell the truth and the statement was made to him that it would be better for him to do so, did not render the confession involuntary.\u00a0 In State <i>vs<\/i>. Leuth (5 Ohio C. C, 94), it was held that the bare exhortation by the police captain to the accused that he had better tell the truth did not render a confession involuntary, since this was not an influence exerted toward an untruth.\u00a0 The confession of a prisoner, charged with receiving stolen goods, to a private person was held voluntary although made after the statement to the latter that it would be better for the accused to tell the truth.\u00a0 (Lucasey <i>vs<\/i>. U.\u00a0 S., Fed. Cas., 8588a.)\u00a0 In Roszczyniala <i>vs<\/i>. State (125 Wis., 414; 104 N. W., 113), it was held that statements made by an officer\u00a0 to the accused, \"Why don't you tell the truth?\" and \"You better tell the truth about this matter.\u00a0 They have all identified you,\" were not enough to render inculpatory statements\u00a0 involuntary.\u00a0 The great weight of authority is to the same effect.\u00a0\u00a0 (Kelly <i>vs<\/i>. State, 72 Ala., 244; Hardy <i>vs<\/i>. U. SM 3 App. D. C, 35; State <i>vs<\/i>. Kornstett, 62 Kan., 221; 61 Pac, 805; State <i>vs<\/i>. Staley, 14 Minn., 75; State <i>vs<\/i>. Anderson, 96 Mo., 241; 9 S. W., 636.)\u00a0 We think that under all the circumstances, the confession was properly admitted.<br\/><br\/>There\u00a0 was some attempt made to establish an alibi for the defendant.\u00a0 The defendant gave a detailed statement of her whereabouts from the time she left\" her house at 4 o'clock on the afternoon of the fire until the fire occurred.\u00a0 According to her statement she went to see a friend in Calle G. Tuason, where she stayed about an\u00a0 hour; from there she went to buy some cloth at a store on Calle San Pedro, where she stayed a little more than half an hour; and from there she went to her son's house where She stayed a little more than half an hour, and was on her way home when she saw the fire engines at work at the scene of the fire. To corroborate these statements, Dimas Lampano was called as a witness and testified that he lived on Calle G. Tuason; that he had\u00a0 known the defendant for about fourteen years; that he did not remember the Sunday her house was burned; that the defendant called on him the second day of the month about half past 4 or 5 o'clock; that he did not know what day of the week it was, but later he stated that it was Sunday; that he remembered this visit because on Monday he received a letter from Vitas for some work to be done there.\u00a0 Felisa del Rosario testified that she lived on Calle San Pedro; that she had known the defendant about four years; that she did not remember the day the defendant's house was burned; that she remembered that the defendant had visited her on a Sunday afternoon, that she could not remember how long ago that was, but that she came to the house about 5 or 5.30\u00a0 in the afternoon to buy some cloth; that\u00a0 it was on the 2d of June that defendant came to see her; that she never came there again; that she could not say when the defendant came to her house before that; and that she remembered the defendant came that day because her children fell down the staircase.\u00a0 Juan Evangelista testified that his mother came to his house between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening; and that about three or four minutes after his mother left he heard the fire engines passing by.<br\/><br\/>It will be noted that although both Lampano and Felisa del Rosario first stated that they did not remember the day on which the defendant visited them, they\u00a0 concluded by not only fixing the day but the hour when she called on them; that the hour fixed\u00a0 by them when the defendant paid her respective visits almost exactly dovetailed into the testimony of the defendant herself in these respects; and that both of these witnesses were enabled to fix the day and the hour of the defendant's visits to them, not by any significance attached to the visit itself but by incidents, entirely unconnected with the defendant, and apparently very insignificant in themselves.\u00a0 Such testimony would be subject to\u00a0 great suspicion\u00a0 under any circumstances.\u00a0 In considering the testimony of Juan Evangelista it must be remembered that he was the son of the defendant and was very much interested in establishing the innocence of his mother.\u00a0 It is the only evidence in the record counteracting the case made by the prosecution.\u00a0 As opposed to it we have the formidable array of circumstantial evidence tending strongly to show intent and motive of the defendant for setting fire to the house; the fact that the fire originated in the living\u00a0 quarters of the accused; that it was, by the testimony of the acting chief of the fire department and his assistant, of incendiary origin; and finally, the extrajudicial confession of the accused herself that she started the fire.\u00a0 This circumstantial evidence, supported by the confession of the accused, is, we think, conclusive of her guilt.<br\/><br\/>Upon the, evidence presented it does not appear that the house was\u00a0 inhabited at the time the fire occurred, or that there were persons on the premises as charged in the information; for it appears that all the persons living there had left the place for another residence although the defendant says she was going back to the place to sleep that night.\u00a0 Under these circumstances the lower\u00a0 court found the appellant guilty under article 557 of the Penal Code, which reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"Art. 557.\u00a0 Any person who shall set fire to anything not falling\u00a0 within the terms of the preceding articles shall suffer:<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"4. The penalty of <i>presidio correccional<\/i> in its medium and\u00a0 maximum degrees, if the damage shall exceed 6,250 pesetas,\"<\/blockquote>In commenting upon this article of the code, Viada (vol. 3, p. 607) says that this article must be considered as supplementary to and\u00a0 the\u00a0 complement of the preceding articles, the provisions of which are applicable to those cases of arson which are not <i>specially<\/i> included or\u00a0 provided for in them.\u00a0 This is the only function it can have, as it specifically states that it is applicable to cases \"not falling within the terms of the preceding articles.\"\u00a0 Its provisions are general and are not designed to take the place of specific penalties provided in the chapter of\u00a0 which it forms a part.<br\/><br\/>The building in this case, although not inhabited, was standing in a populated place, and the damage to it exceeded 6,250 pesetas.\u00a0 These two circumstances are exactly the requirements of article 551, paragraph 2, and the penalty provided is <i>presidio mayor<\/i>.\u00a0 The aggravating circumstance or nocturnity being present in the commission of this crime, the penalty should be imposed in its maximum degree.\u00a0 The appellant in this case being a woman, however, the\u00a0 punishment should be changed to <i>prision mayor<\/i> in accordance with article 95 of the Code.\u00a0 The penalty imposed by the trial court is therefore set aside, and the appellant is hereby sentenced to ten years and one day of <i>prision mayor<\/i>, together with the accessory penalties provided by\u00a0 law; to indemnify the owner of the building in the sum of P10,562; and to the payment of the costs of the cause.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

I., did willfully and criminally, without legitimate authority therefor, and by means of violence or force employed upon the person of Claro Mercado, prevent the latter from rendering aid to Maria R. Mateo in order that Santiago Mercado might at his pleasure maltreat the said Maria R. Mateo, in violation of law.\"<\/blockquote>After hearing the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause, the Honorable Alberto Barretto, judge, found the defendants guilty of the crime charged in the complaint, without any aggravating or extenuating circumstances, and sentenced each of them to be imprisoned for a period of two months and one day of <i>arresto mayor<\/i>, with the accessory penalties of the law, to pay a fine of 325 <i>pesetas<\/i> and in case of insolvency to suffer subsidiary imprisonment, allowing to the defendants one-half\u00a0 of the time they had already suffered in\u00a0 prison, and each to pay one-third part of the costs.\u00a0 From that sentence each of the defendants appealed to this court and made the following assignments of error:<br\/><blockquote>\"I. The trial court erred\u00a0 in overruling the objection of the accused to the private prosecutor's question referring to the character of the witness.<br\/><br\/>\"II. The trial court erred in reaching the conclusion that the crime prosecuted was committed and that the accused are responsible therefor.<br\/><br\/>\"III. The trial court erred in sentencing the accused.<br\/><br\/>\"IV. The trial court erred in not having the accused testify in their own behalf, as they offered to do, allowing them to testify in the same way as he did the sole witness for the defense.\"<\/blockquote>With reference to the first assignment of error, we find by referring to page 75 of the record, that Mr. Ricardo Gonzalez Lloret, attorney for the private prosecutor, asked the witness for the defense, the said Santiago Mercado, who is mentioned in the complaint presented in said cause, the following question;<br\/><blockquote>\"How\u00a0 many times have you been\u00a0 convicted of assault upon other persons?\"<\/blockquote>To this question, the defendant Tomas Mercado objected on the ground that the question was impertinent.\u00a0 Mr. Lloret explained the purpose of his question by saying:<br\/><blockquote>\"I wish to demonstrate that he has a pugnacious disposition.\u00a0 I have had occasion to defend him in various causes for assault\"<\/blockquote>Upon the question and the objection Judge Barretto ruled that \"the character of the witness has an intimate relation or may have a strong relation with the facts being investigated in the present cause.\u00a0 The objection is overruled.\"<br\/><br\/>To that ruling of the court the\u00a0 defendant duly excepted.\u00a0 Said exception is assigned here as the first assignment of error.\u00a0 The only argument which the appellant presents in support of his assignment of error is that the question had no relation to the question which was being discussed by the court and did not tend to show that the defendants were either guilty or not guilty of the crime charged; that questions tending to disclose the character of a witness are immaterial.\u00a0 In reply to the argument of the appellant, the Attorney-General contends that the question was a proper question, because, it tended to impugn the credibility of the witness and that such questions were for that purpose material and pertinent.\u00a0 It will be remembered that the complaint charged that on the occasion when the alleged crime was committed Santiago Mercado was attempting to and did assault and illtreat one Maria R. Mateo.\u00a0 In answer to said question, the witness admitted that complaint had been presented against him\u00a0 for the offense of assault and battery.<br\/><br\/>The prosecution, in order to show the circumstances under which the crime charged here was actually committed, showed that this witness,\u00a0 Santiago Mercado, had assaulted and illtreated Maria R. Mateo, under the circumstances described in the complaint.\u00a0 That was an important fact.\u00a0 If the said assault did not actually take place, then the theory of the prosecution must fail.\u00a0 If there was no assault or attempted assault, there was no occasion for the alleged interference on the part of the said Claro Mercado to prevent it, and the probability of the guilt of the defendants is greatly lessened.\u00a0 If the witness who had committed the alleged assault, had assaulted other persons and had been prosecuted therefor, may that fact be considered by the court in weighing the proof and in testing the credibility of the witness?\u00a0 It was an important fact to prove that Santiago Mercado, at the time and place mentioned in the complaint, had assaulted or attempted to assault or illtreat Maria R. Mateo, in order to show that there was occasion for the interference of Claro Mercado.<br\/><br\/>Generally speaking, a witness cannot be impeached by the party against whom he has been called, except by showing (<i>a<\/i>) that he has made contradictory statements; or (<i>b<\/i>) by showing that <i>his general reputation for truth, honesty, or integrity is bad<\/i>.\u00a0 (Sec. 342, Act No.\u00a0 190.)\u00a0 The question to which the defendant objected neither attempted to show that the witness had made contradictory statements nor that his general reputation for truth, honesty, or integrity was bad.\u00a0 While you cannot impeach the credibility of a witness, except\u00a0 by showing that he has made contradictory statements or that his general reputation for truth, honesty, or integrity is bad, yet, nevertheless, you may show by an examination of the witness himself or from the record of the judgment,\u00a0 that he has been convicted of a high crime.\u00a0 (Sec. 342, Act No. 190.)\u00a0 In the present case, the other offense to which the question above related was not a high crime, as that term is generally used, and we assume that the phrase \"high crime,\" as used in section 342, is used in its ordinary signification.\u00a0 High crimes are generally defined as such immoral and unlawful acts as are nearly allied and equal in guilt to felonies.\u00a0 We believe that the objection to the above question was properly interposed and should have been sustained.\u00a0 The question now arises, did the admission of the question prejudice the rights of the defendants?\u00a0\u00a0 If there was proof\u00a0 enough adduced during\u00a0 the trial of the cause, excluding the particular proof brought out by this question to show that the defendants are guilty of the crime, then the question and answer and the ruling of the court upon the same did not affect prejudicially the interests of the defendants.\u00a0 Errors committed by the trial court, which are not prejudicial to the rights of the parties, should be disregarded by the court.\u00a0 In our\u00a0 opinion the evidence clearly shows that the witness committed the assault to which reference is made in the complaint in the present cause.\u00a0 Whether he had committed other assaults or not was a matter of no importance in the present action.\u00a0 The admission or rejection, therefore, of the proof to which such question related could in no way prejudice the rights of the defendants.<br\/><br\/>The second and third assignments of error relate to the sufficiency of the proof adduced during the trial of the cause to show\u00a0 that the defendants were guilty of the crime charged.\u00a0 A question of fact only is raised by these assignments of error. After a careful examination of the proof, we are convinced that the same shows, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendants are each guilty in the manner and form charged in the complaint.\u00a0 We find no reason for modifying the conclusions of fact reached by the lower court.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the fourth assignment of error, an examination of the record shows that but one witness was examined for the defense: that was the said Santiago Mercado.\u00a0 At the close of the examination of said witness, we find the following statement by the accused:<br\/><blockquote>\"The accused state that should they testify they would testify in the same way as the witness Santiago R. Mercado, with whose testimony they close their\u00a0 evidence.<br\/><br\/>\"Both parties close\u00a0 their evidence.\"<\/blockquote>Even admitting that the accused, had they testified, would have made the same declarations as those made by the only witness, Santiago Mercado, we are of the opinion that such declarations would not\u00a0 have been sufficient, inasmuch as they would have added nothing to the record, except an accumulation of proof, to have shown that the defendants were not guilty of the crime charged.\u00a0 We find no reason in the fourth assignment of error for modifying the conclusions of the lower court.<br\/><br\/>After a careful examination of the record, we are persuaded that the same shows, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendants were guilty of the crime charged and that the sentence of the lower court should be affirmed, with costs.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

ALBERTO BARRETTO, JUDGE OF FIRST INSTANCE OF RIZAL, AND CONSTANCIO JOAQUIN, RESPONDENTS.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>MORELAND, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">A decision having been rendered in this case dismissing the application for a writ of certiorari, the respondents or defendants in that application now come asking for an assessment by this court of the damages occasioned by reason of the issuance in that proceeding of an injunction by one of the members of this court restraining the defendant from operating his cockpit until this court should have passed finally upon the application for the writ.<br\/><br\/>It is provided by the Code of Civil Procedure that an injunction may be granted upon the demonstration to the court of certain facts and the presentation of an undertaking with sufficient sureties, conditioned \"that the plaintiff will pay to the party enjoined all such damages as such party may sustain by reason of the injunction, if the court should finally decide that the plaintiff was not entitled thereto.\"<br\/><br\/>Section 170 of the Code (Act No.\u00a0 190) provides that:<br\/><blockquote>\"Upon final trial the amount of damages to be awarded to the plaintiff or to the defendant upon the obligations provided in the last four preceding sections shall be ascertained by the court trying the action, and judgment for the same shall be included in the final judgment and the judgment shall be both against the plaintiff and against the sureties upon any obligation given under the provisions of any of the last four sections.\" <\/blockquote>We do not believe that this court should take cognizance of the proceeding for damages as proposed.\u00a0 Certiorari is not an action within the sense in which that word is used in the sections of the Code of Civil Procedure relating to injunctions.\u00a0 Certiorari being limited in its issuance to cases involving jurisdictional defects can never be a proceeding in which the\u00a0 merits of a cause are ventilated.\u00a0 If an application for the writ be made before the action or proceeding in the inferior court is terminated, and such application is well founded, the only result will be, in a case where the court has exceeded its jurisdiction, the correction of the error and the continuation of the cause in the trial court in accordance with law.\u00a0 If the action or proceeding in the inferior court is terminated, this court in certiorari will either affirm,\u00a0 annul, or modify.\u00a0 In either case, it will be presumed that the party interested will take or has taken such proceedings in the court below as will protect him in the prosecution of the proceeding to obtain the damages sustained by reason of the injunction, if any.\u00a0 In certiorari this court touches no question but one of law and makes no adjudication which in any sense affects the merits of the action or proceeding in the inferior court.\u00a0 In that sense, therefore, it is not an action.<br\/><br\/>Under such circumstances, this court is not warranted in taking cognizance of the proceeding presented to it.\u00a0 If we may assume for the moment that the court could find any basis for such a proceeding before it, or there could be presented any facts which would warrant its action, we can readily see what embarrassment might arise.\u00a0 If this court should determine that the party restrained by the injunction had suffered damages and should award him a sum sufficient to compensate him, the Court of First Instance subsequently, after a trial on the merits of the cause, might find that the party restrained was not entitled to a judgment upon the merits and had no basis whatever for his action.\u00a0 This very case is an illustration of that possible condition.\u00a0 Plaintiff in the action in the court below asked for a mandamus to compel the issuance to him of a cockpit license.\u00a0 In that action he obtained a mandatory injunction compelling the issuance of one to continue during the pendency of the action.\u00a0 A member of this court, upon a proceeding in certiorari, issued an injunction against the plaintiff in the court below restraining him from exploiting his cockpit under that license until \"the\u00a0 Supreme Court should finally pass upon the certiorari proceeding.\u00a0 This court, acting upon the application, dismissed it, at the same time\u00a0 dissolving the injunction against the plaintiff in the court below.\u00a0 If, now, upon the proceeding presented for the assessment of damages, this court should find that the plaintiff in the court\u00a0 below was entitled to the sum asked, namely, P33,000, we might possibly be met in the future with a judgment of the Court of First Instance upon the merits of the cause, declaring that the plaintiff in that action was not entitled to a cockpit license and therefore suffered no damage by reason of not having been permitted to use it while the injunction was in force.\u00a0 If that judgment were well founded, then the plaintiff in that action could have suffered no damage by reason of the restraining order issued by the member of this court.\u00a0 It is apparent, therefore, that, before this court can determine intelligently and properly the question of damages resulting from an injunction, it must have before it for adjudication the merits of the cause.\u00a0 The merits never being before the court in a proceeding for the issuance of a writ of certiorari, no damages can be assessed by this court in that proceeding.\u00a0 This court is not, in certiorari proceedings, \"the court trying the action\" which has cognizance of the \"final trial.\"<br\/><br\/>As we have already said, certiorari is not an action within the meaning\u00a0 of section 170 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u00a0 While the\u00a0 decisions of this court frequently refer to the proceeding as \"an ordinary action,\" such language, although correct in the sense used, is not intended to convey the idea that the proceeding is such in all that the term implies, especially in the sense in which the word is used in the section just referred to.<br\/><br\/>In the case of Blanco<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> vs.<\/span> Ambler (3 Phil. Rep., 358), the court said at page 360: \"The court has adopted a different practice in case of certiorari from that adopted in cases of mandate and prohibition.\u00a0 The latter take the form of an ordinary action.\u00a0 In the former an order to show cause is issued and upon its return, if no sufficient cause is shown, the order provided for by section 217 is issued.\"<br\/><br\/>In the case of Beech <i>vs<\/i>. Crossfield (12 Phil. Rep., 555), the court said:\u00a0 \"It\u00a0 was\u00a0 suggested at the argument that some of the\u00a0 defendants in this case had made no proper answer to the order to show cause.\u00a0 We had directed that the defendants should appear\u00a0 and state their reasons why a writ of certiorari should not be granted.\u00a0 Some of them appeared and presented what they called a demurrer to the complaint and the plaintiff says that a demurrer in such cases is improper.\u00a0 That is true, but the document they presented was improperly called by them a demurrer.\u00a0 If they saw fit to answer the order to show cause by saying that they admitted all the facts stated in the complaint, but that even on such admission the plaintiff was not entitled to relief, they had a right to do so.\u00a0 That is, in effect, what they did.\u00a0 The document which they called a demurrer was, in effect, their answer to the order to show cause.\"<br\/><br\/>From these decisions it is clear that certiorari is not considered by this court an action in all senses.\u00a0 While it may take somewhat the form of an action, being begun perhaps by a complaint, or something similar\u00a0 thereto, followed by what may be termed an answer, or what may be, in substance, a demurrer, it lacks many of the essential features of an action.\u00a0 It never touches the merits of the cause and deals almost exclusively with questions of law based upon the record of the case.\u00a0 A proceeding which, in its final judgment, does not touch the merits of the cause can hardly be called an action in all senses.<br\/><br\/>The motion to assess damages is denied and the parties are remanded to the Court of First Instance for the vindication of their rights, if any they have, in that particular.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres<\/i> and <i>Mapa, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><i>Carson<\/i>, J., concurs in the result.<br\/><br\/><br\/><hr align=\"CENTER\" noshade=\"NOSHADE\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">DISSENTING<\/span><br\/><\/div><br\/><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">TRENT, J.,<\/span><br\/><br\/>I dissent.<br\/><br\/>I cannot concur with my brethren in the disposition of this case, first, because the court, notwithstanding that it has decreed that\u00a0 the injunction\u00a0 was wrongfully issued against the defendant, refuses to now entertain his claim for damages for such wrongful issuance; and, second, because the majority opinion is directly in\u00a0 the teeth of the decisions of this court in Somes <i>vs<\/i>. Crossfield (9 Phil. Rep., 13) and Macatangay <i>vs<\/i>. Municipality of San Juan de Bocboc (9 Phil. Rep., 19).\u00a0 The court does not attempt to say that the defendant has not suffered damages.\u00a0 It simply refuses to hear him on this point.<br\/><br\/>The court finds a distinction between the action in certiorari and other actions which relieves it from the duty of assessing damages in such an action.\u00a0 Section 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides in part as follows:\u00a0 \"An 'action' means an ordinary suit in a court of justice, by which one party prosecutes another for the enforcement or protection of a\u00a0 right, or the <i>redress<\/i> or prevention of a wrong; every other remedy furnished by law is a special proceeding.\"<br\/><br\/>Part II of the\u00a0 Code is devoted to special proceedings but certiorari is not included therein.\u00a0 Certiorari is found in part I of the Code under the heading \"Special Remedies.\"\u00a0 Section 217 distinctly requires that the initial pleading in certiorari shall be a complaint, notwithstanding that it is often familiarly called by\u00a0 the court and bar a petition, the latter being reserved as the name of the initial pleading in special proceedings.\u00a0 If certiorari is an action and must be commenced by a complaint, the proceedings are subject and amenable to the rules governing the progress of any other action through courts of justice, subject only to the special provisions of sections 217-221, which give it its special character as a proceeding in certiorari.\u00a0 If there be anything in these sections which prohibits the courts from assessing damages for the wrongful issuance of an injunction during the progress of the certiorari proceedings, my brethren have failed to point it out.\u00a0 And, notwithstanding that section 170, which is quoted in the majority opinion, provides that damages for the issuance of an injunction, shall be assessed upon the final trial of an <i>action<\/i>, the court has refused to follow these directions on the ground that certiorari is different from other actions.\u00a0 It is true that it is different from and has other\u00a0 functions than an action for the appointment of a receiver, for the partition of real estate, for the usurpation of an office or franchise, for mandate, prohibition, contempt, eminent domain, foreclosure, and manual delivery of personal property.\u00a0 So also are each of those named different from the others.\u00a0 They are all special remedies as is also certiorari.\u00a0 Circumstances can be conceived when an injunction would be a proper accompaniment of a complaint asking for any one of these special remedies.<br\/><br\/>The court refers to Blanco <i>vs<\/i>. Ambler (3 Phil. Rep., 358), as making a distinction between certiorari, and mandate and prohibition.\u00a0 Mandate and prohibition, like certiorari, are special remedies.\u00a0 If it be conceded that they are ordinary actions as that term is used in the Code of Civil Procedure, there is no reason for saying that certiorari is not, since it also is a special remedy and is provided for in the same chapter of the code as mandate and prohibition.\u00a0 But conceding that it is the practice of this court to issue an order to show cause in certiorari, does this fact have the effect of so far changing an action in certiorari that damages for the wrongful issuance of an injunction could be assessed in mandate and prohibition while in certiorari they could not be assessed?\u00a0 Moreover, any effect that decision might have toward denying the right of a defendant to file a demurrer to the complaint in an action of certiorari appears to have been overruled in Artacho <i>vs<\/i>. Tan\u00a0 Chu Chay (11 Phil. Rep., 47), in\u00a0 which the opinion of the court was written by the same member who wrote\u00a0 the opinion in Blanco <i>vs<\/i>. Ambler.\u00a0 In the Artacho case it is said:\u00a0 \"This is an original action in certiorari in this court.\u00a0 The defendants demurred to the complaint and\u00a0 the case is now before us for resolution of this demurrer.\"<br\/><br\/>It was held that the complaint did not state a cause of action, and the demurrer was sustained, with leave to the plaintiff to amend.\u00a0 By reference to the decisions of this court, it may be found that the parties in certiorari are called respectively, plaintiffs and defendants; that the initial pleading is termed a complaint; that the complaint may be demurred to; that it may be amended; that final judgment is rendered; and that the whole procedure is termed an <i>action<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>No. 34 of the Rules of this court provides:\u00a0 \"When the original jurisdiction of this court is invoked in cases of certiorari, mandamus, prohibition, and quo warranto, like procedure as to process and pleading shall be observed as is provided in the Code of Civil Procedure and the Rules of court for ordinary actions.\"<br\/><br\/>The terms used by this court to describe\u00a0 an action of certiorari and its parts are all technical terms, defined with great care in the Code of Civil Procedure, and have certain functions, also carefully defined, in that legal procedure defined as an \"action\" in section 1 (<i>supra<\/i>).\u00a0 If, with these attributes, damages for the wrongful issuance of an injunction cannot be assessed in certiorari, when it is admitted that they may, in a proper case, exist, it is difficult to see how such damages can be assessed as an incident of the final judgment in any other ordinary action.<br\/><br\/>By distinguishing between certiorari on the one hand, and prohibition and mandate on the other, it is assumed that the court would allow, in a proper case,\u00a0 damages for the wrongful issuance of an injunction in\u00a0 either of the last two named proceedings.\u00a0 It is quite evident, however, that neither an application for mandamus\u00a0 nor one for prohibition goes to the merits of the controversy out of which arose the action or the threatened\u00a0 action of the court to which objection is made by the mandamus or prohibition plaintiff.\u00a0 In prohibition, the whole question to be determined is whether there was jurisdiction to perform the act complained of.\u00a0 If such an act is within the jurisdiction of the court, the writ is denied, regardless of whether the act complained of may be\u00a0 subject to reversal by an ordinary appeal.\u00a0 In\u00a0 mandamus, the whole question is, was the act complained of within the legitimate bounds of judicial discretion?\u00a0 If it was, whether the court\u00a0 acted wisely or committed an error of judgrrient avails the mandamus plaintiff nothing.\u00a0 If the merits of the controversy are not reached by either of the three writs, I am unable to see why this fact should be made the ground for denying the certiorari defendant relief for the wrongful issuance of an injunction, while it has no such effect in mandamus and prohibition.<br\/><br\/>Suppose we consider a few hypothetical cases such as are liable to come up any day.\u00a0 The Board of Rate Regulation is a board which exercises judicial functions.\u00a0 (Act No. 1791.)\u00a0 It therefore falls within the provisions of section 217 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u00a0 In an original action or proceeding of certiorari in this Court the plaintiff alleges that the said Board has exceeded its jurisdiction or acted without jurisdiction in fixing the rates to be charged by a certain public service corporation, or in promulgating rules and regulations for the government of such a corporation; and also alleges the other necessary facts.\u00a0 In conformance with the prayer a preliminary injunction is granted.\u00a0 Upon final hearing the court finds that the regulations are not well founded and renders judgment against the plaintiff dissolving the injunction and dismissing the complaint with costs.\u00a0 When and where and by what court or tribunal must the damages for which the bond is given be determined and fixed?\u00a0 The Board cannot do so because the law does not authorize it to determine such questions.\u00a0 In original actions of mandamus and prohibition in this court against the Board of Kate Regulation the same question might be asked, but this court has indirectly held that the damages in these two cases would be determined by this court in the same action.\u00a0 A justice of the peace tries a case which involves, as the plaintiff claims, the right to the possession of a large <i>hacienda<\/i>.\u00a0 The defendant contends that the title is necessarily involved.\u00a0 Judgment for the plaintiff for possession. The defendant by reason of the amount of the bond required is unable to appeal.\u00a0 He institutes in this court certiorari proceedings and upon the presentation of a bond which he is now able to give obtains a preliminary injunction against the execution of the judgment of the justice of the peace.\u00a0 The basis of his action is that the\u00a0 justice of the\u00a0 peace was without jurisdiction.\u00a0 Upon trial this court finds that the justice of the peace did have jurisdiction and renders judgment dissolving the injunction and dismissing the complaint.\u00a0 The damages to the certiorari defendant for which the bond was given amount to several thousand pesos.\u00a0 The justice of the peace has long since terminated the original trial.\u00a0 What tribunal must determine the damages caused by the wrongful issuance of the preliminary injunction?\u00a0 Has the justice of the peace jurisdiction to decide this question in view of the fact that unliquidated damages in a large amount are involved?\u00a0 Under the holding, this court will not determine these damages.\u00a0 If the justice of the peace cannot, then an original action must be instituted, I suppose, in the Court of First Instance.\u00a0 From the judgment of that court an appeal will lie to this court where the damages must finally be settled.\u00a0 If the justice of the peace has jurisdiction an appeal will lie to the Court of First Instance and finally come here.\u00a0 Innumerable cases of the character of these can be mentioned.\u00a0 I think this court is wrong and it will have again to reverse itself and go back to the old rule established six years ago.<br\/><br\/>I do not believe there is a single clause in our Practice Act which can be seized upon as indicating the intention of the legislature that damages for the issuance of an injunction in certiorari proceedings are not to be assessed in the final, certiorari judgment.\u00a0 Yet this court has so laid the rule, and in explaining its operation says:\u00a0 \"If an application for the writ be made before the action or proceeding in the inferior court is terminated, and such application is well founded, the only result will be, in a case where the court has exceeded its jurisdiction, the correction of the error and the continuation of the case in the trial court in accordance with law.\"<br\/><br\/>The court then goes on to say that in such cases the defendant in certiorari will be presumed to take such proceedings in the court below as will save him harmless from the wrongful issuance of an injunction staying the proceedings in\u00a0 the lower court.\u00a0\u00a0 In one breath the court says that if the certiorari is well founded the only result is the correction of the error of the lower court and the continuation of the cause in the trial court.\u00a0 In the next it admits as a <i>possible<\/i> result of such a disposition of the certiorari action, damage to the certiorari defendant.\u00a0 The <i>injunction bond<\/i> is designed to save the one enjoined from injury.\u00a0 What further steps are necessary?<br\/><br\/>The other proposition advanced in the majority opinion is as follows:\u00a0 \"If the action or proceeding in the inferior court is terminated, this court in certiorari will either affirm, annul, or modify.\"<br\/><br\/>And it is then laid down that the certiorari defendant will also be presumed to guard his interests by some proceeding in the lower court.\u00a0 Evidently he can take no further proceeding in an action which has been concluded by a final judgment.\u00a0 He might, it is true, ask the inferior court to require the certiorari plaintiff to execute a bond securing him for the\u00a0 damages he might suffer while the execution of the final judgment was stayed by the writs of certiorari and injunction sued out by his adversary.\u00a0 But could such inferior court, even were it inclined to do so, require the certiorari plaintiff to do this?\u00a0 The only effective method of compelling the certiorari plaintiff to execute such a bond would be to require it as a condition precedent to further proceedings in the certiorari action.\u00a0 But that would be mere effrontery on the part of the inferior court, and, needless to say, this court would not permit such trifling with cases pending before it.\u00a0 This method of saving himself from damages by reason of such writs of certiorari and injunction being denied the certiorari defendant imposes upon him the necessity of instituting a separate and distinct action from either the one concluded by the final judgment in the original case or the one forming the basis for the final judgment in certiorari.\u00a0 And consequently, he is deprived of his right to have included in the final judgment an award for damages.<br\/><br\/>It is urged in the majority opinion that if we allow the defendant in the case at bar to recover on the injunction bond, we might be met with a future judgment declaring that the defendant had no rights in the controversy.\u00a0 Yet this court, in an elaborate opinion, has already declared that he has the right, and has expressly conferred\u00a0 it upon him, of operating his business\u00a0 under a mandatory injunction in that cause.\u00a0 The court fails to distinguish between his rights as finally determined in that cause and his rights under the mandatory injunction.\u00a0 He is at this time, and by virtue of the authority of this court, in the full exercise and enjoyment of his rights under the mandatory injunction in question.\u00a0 It must be remembered that in order to exercise these rights he was compelled to execute a bond saving the herein plaintiffs from all damages by his exploitation of the cockpit privileges.\u00a0 It was not, therefore, necessary for the herein plaintiffs to resort to the extraordinary legal remedies of certiorari and injunction in order to vindicate all their rights and secure indemnity for all damages suffered by them during the pendency of that cause in the courts up to its final termination.\u00a0\u00a0 It is no answer to this proposition that the herein defendant may eventually be thrown out of court.\u00a0 His right to operate his business in the mean time has been determined and it is not clear why an interference with it by his adversaries in the original litigation is any the less reprehensible or makes them any the less liable for damages arising from such interference than if the\u00a0 injunction which caused the interruption of that business had been issued by some stranger to the controversy.\u00a0 \"Every possessor,\" says the Civil Code, \"has a right to be respected in his possession.\"\u00a0 (Art.\u00a0 446.)\u00a0 \"The\u00a0 fruits collected in good faith by a possessor during the time the possession is not legally interrupted become his own.\"\u00a0 (Art. 451.)\u00a0 Let us suppose that an entire stranger to the present controversy sued out an injunction from some wrongful motive interrupting the herein defendant in the operation of his business.\u00a0 Would this court hesitate to afford him redress on the ground that his ultimate rights in the present controversy were undetermined ?\u00a0 It is clear that if defendant's right to operate his business under the mandatory injunction which has been confirmed by a nonappealable judgment of this high court is not a mere delusion, if it has any substance at all, damages may result from its infringement,\u00a0 which cannot by any means be made to depend upon defendant's ultimate rights in some other legal controversy.\u00a0 This being true, there can be no reason for a strained and hair-splitting distinction between the action of certiorari and other actions, in order to deny the defendant the privilege of having his damages assessed in that action in accordance with section 170 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br\/><br\/>Not only has the court departed from the express provisions of law as to the assessment of damages for the wrongful issuance of an injunction, but it has also directly reversed itself on the point at issue.\u00a0 The case of Macatangay <i>vs<\/i>. San Juan de Boctoc (<i>supra<\/i>) was an original action in this court wherein the plaintiff prayed for a writ of <i>certiorari and a preliminary injunction<\/i> against the defendant municipality.\u00a0 Before this court had attempted to adjudicate the question plaintiff asked that his action be dismissed.\u00a0 The defendant municipality appeared and asked that the damages sustained by it by reason of the <i>injunction<\/i> be assessed.\u00a0 This court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"Upon a consideration of the motion of the plaintiff to dismiss his action, the same is granted, without prejudice to the right of the defendant to present in this court specifications, in the nature of a complaint, setting forth the grounds relied upon for the purpose of recovering damages against the plaintiff, before final judgment is entered dismissing the said cause, in accordance with the ruling of this court in the case of Somes <i>vs<\/i>. Crossfield et al.\u00a0 (8 Phil. Rep., 284.)<br\/><br\/>\"The Attorney-General in his motion asks that this court order the said cause to be referred to the Court of First Instance of the Province of Batangas for the purpose of ascertaining and reporting to this court the amount of damages which the defendant has sustained by reason of the granting of the said injunction.\u00a0 The defendant is entitled to have the amount of his damages ascertained and to have them included in the final judgment in said cause, but section 170 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions provides that said damages <i>shall be ascertained by the court in which the action is pending<\/i>.\u00a0 The present was an original action in this court; therefore it is the order of this court that the defendant file, in this court, within a period of ten days after the receipt of notice of this order, specifications, in the nature of a complaint, setting forth the grounds relied upon for the purpose of recovering damages against the plaintiff and his bondsmen, by reason of the granting of the said injunction, and to serve a copy of these specifications upon the plaintiff and the said bondsmen.\"<\/blockquote>In accordance with this decision the clerk of this court was appointed a referee to receive evidence as to the damages sustained by the certiorari defendant and <i>this Supreme Court<\/i>, after a review of the evidence thus taken, assessed the damages sustained at approximately P200.\u00a0 It is clear that had this procedure not been followed the defendant municipality would have been compelled to institute a new and entirely separate action in the <i>Court of First Instance<\/i> to recover the damages it sustained.<br\/><br\/>In that case the question as to where and how the damages must be determined was directly raised.\u00a0 It was the only question presented and decided.\u00a0 The Attorney-General asked that the matter be referred to the Court of First Instance for determination but this motion was denied without a dissenting vote.<br\/><br\/>But the case which completely supports my position on the question under consideration is Somes <i>vs<\/i>. Grossfield (9 Phil. Rep., 13).\u00a0 In that case Somes had secured a judgment against one De la Riva.\u00a0 Various other judgment creditors of De la Riva were proceeding to advertise an execution sale of his property when Somes instituted an action in the Court of First Instance against them in which he sought to have his own judgment take preference over the others by reason of its antedating them, and, at the same\u00a0 time, asked for an injunction\u00a0 prohibiting further steps toward the sale of De la Riva's property.\u00a0 The Court of First Instance refused to grant the preliminary injunction, and ordered that the sale be made as advertised, with the proviso that if Somes executed a bond indemnifying the various judgment creditors, who had instigated the execution sale, the proceeds thereof would be deposited in court pending the determination of the alleged priority of his claim.\u00a0 Instead of executing this bond, Somes filed <i>a petition of certiorari in this court and secured a preliminary injunction which stopped the preparations for the sale<\/i>.\u00a0 These facts, which\u00a0 do not clearly appear in the printed report, are apparent from an inspection of the record.\u00a0 The judgment creditors who had been made defendants in this certiorari action, <i>demurred to the complaint<\/i>, the preliminary injunction in the meantime having been dissolved, and the demurrer was sustained, with leave to amend.\u00a0 Somes not having elected to amend, the judgment became final and the certiorari defendants appeared before this court asking for damages by reason of the sale\u00a0 as originally planned having been prevented because of the preliminary injunction issued at the request of the certiorari plaintiff, Somes.\u00a0 This court quoted section 170 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and then said:<br\/><blockquote>\"In view of these provisions requiring that the damages shall be ascertained upon the final judgment, we are of the opinion, and so hold, that it is the duty of the parties seeking damages by reason of the granting of the injunction to file in the court in which the action is pending, specifications, in the nature of a complaint, setting forth the grounds upon which damages are claimed, serving copies of such specifications upon the parties against whom the damages are claimed, and asking that the court shall take such steps as may be advisable and necessary, by hearing the parties itself, or by appointing a commission for that purpose.<br\/><br\/>\"Therefore it is the judgment of this court that, if the defendants herein desire to recover damages against the plaintiff\"\u00a0 and his bondsmen, by reason of the said injunction, they must within ten days after receipt of this order file in this court specifications, setting forth the grounds upon which they expect to claim damages.\"<\/blockquote>It is very clear that the action in certiorari did not touch the merits of the litigation.\u00a0 Whether Somes's judgment, as a matter of fact, was entitled to priority over those of the other judgment creditors, was a question raised by the action instituted by him in the Court of First Instance, and which was pending at the time he instituted his original action of certiorari and secured the issuance of the preliminary injunction in this court.\u00a0 Nor had that question been determined at the time this court ordered the judgment creditors, who had been made defendants in the certiorari action, to\u00a0 file specifications of their damages resulting from the issuance of the preliminary injunction in the said certiorari action.\u00a0 A set of facts more nearly analogous to the case at bar could hardly be hoped for.\u00a0 An ordinary civil action pending in the Court of First Instance, an original action of certiorari instituted in this court accompanied by preliminary injunction, the dissolution of the preliminary injunction and a judgment of this court dismissing the complaint in the certiorari action, followed by the wrongful issuance of a preliminary injunction, was followed, <i>in the Somes case,<\/i> by an order of this court granting the said certiorari defendants the privilege of proving such damages; <i>in the case at bar<\/i>, under the same circumstances, the same request is denied and the defendants are \"<i>remanded to the Court of First Instance for the vindication of their rights, if any they have.\"<\/i><br\/><br\/>The result is that the court has completely reversed itself on the meaning to be given section 170 of the Code of Civil Procedure when applied to original actions in certiorari instituted in this court.\u00a0 Actions in certiorari have, moreover, been distinguished from <i>ordinary civil actions<\/i>, a difference heretofore unobserved, and, in my opinion, only possible by a positive disregard of the law providing for original actions in certiorari in the Supreme Court.<br\/><br\/>Where a question of property, or a rule by which the right to property shall be determined has been definitely decided by adjudicated cases, the court should feel bound to follow it.\u00a0 (Propeller Genessee Chief <i>vs<\/i>. Fitzhugh,\u00a0 12 How., 443.)\u00a0 In questions which affect the rights of property it is better to adhere to principles once fixed, though, originally they might not have been perfectly free from all objections, than to unsettle the law in order to render it more consistent with the dictates of sound reason.\u00a0 (Marine Ins. Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Tucker, 3 Cranch, 357; National Bank <i>vs<\/i>. Whitney, 103 U. S., 99.)\u00a0 While the general authority of adjudication is not denied, the court is not, however, precluded from the right or exempted from the necessity of examining into the correctness or consistency of its own decisions.\u00a0 Moreover, the court should not hesitate to overrule an erroneous decision.\u00a0 (<i>Ex parte<\/i> Bollman, 4 Cranch, 75; Wood <i>vs<\/i>. Brady, 150 U. S., 18; Pollock <i>vs<\/i>. Farmer's Loan, etc., Co., 157 U. S., 429, 575.)\u00a0 But courts should be slow to overrule their decisions especially where they have stood undisturbed for more than six years as the law upon the subject.\u00a0 This court decided in 1907 in the cases of Somes <i>vs<\/i>. Crossfield and Macatangay <i>vs<\/i>. Municipality of San Juan de Bocboc (<i>supra<\/i>), that a person damaged by the wrongful issuing of an injunction in an original action of certiorari instituted in this court may have his damages determined by this court in the same action.<br\/><br\/>The certiorari defendant in the case at bar had, under the ruling of this court, a right to operate his cockpit under the license issued to him.\u00a0 It was a right pertaining to his property.\u00a0 He was deprived of this right by the act of his adversary.\u00a0 The rule laid down by this court in the cases above cited being based upon the law, justice, and sound reason, is therefore perfectly applicable and should prevail. <\/div>",

MILLER, AND SERVILIANO NATIVIDAD, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TRENT, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">The appellants, Hart, Miller, and Natividad, were arraigned in the Court of First Instance of Pampanga on a charge of vagrancy under the provisions of Act No. 519, found guilty, and were each sentenced\u00a0 to six months' imprisonment.\u00a0 Hart and Miller were further sentenced to a fine of P200, and Natividad to a fine of P100.\u00a0 All appealed.<br\/><br\/>The evidence of the prosecution as to\u00a0 the defendant Hart shows that he pleaded guilty and was convicted on a gambling charge about two or three weeks before his arrest on the vagrancy charge; that he had been conducting two gambling games, one in his saloon and the other in another house, for a considerable length of time, the games running every night.\u00a0 The defense showed that Hart and one Dunn operated a hotel and saloon at Angeles which did a business, according to the bookkeeper, of P96,000 during the nineteen months preceding the trial; that Hart was also the sole proprietor of a saloon in the barrio of Tacondo; that he raised imported hogs which he sold to the Army garrison at Gamp Stotsenberg, which business netted him during the preceding year about P4,000; that he was authorized to sell several hundred hectares of land owned by one Carrillo in Tacondo; that he administered, under power of attorney, the same property; and that he furnished a building for and paid the teacher of the first public school in Tacondo, said school being under Government supervision.<br\/><br\/>The evidence of the prosecution as to Miller was that he had the reputation of being a gambler; that he pleaded guilty and was fined for participating in a gambling game about two weeks before his arrest on the present charge of vagrancy; and that he was seen in houses of prostitution and in a public dance hall in Tacondo on various occasions.\u00a0 The defense showed without contradiction that Miller had been discharged from the Army about a year previously; that during his term of enlistment he had been made a sergeant; that he received rating as \"excellent\" on being discharged;'that since his discharge he had been engaged in the tailoring business near Camp Stotsenberg under articles of partneiship with one Burckerd, Miller having contributed Pl,000 to the partnership; that the business netted each partner about P300 per month; that Miller attended to business in an efficient manner every day; and that his work was first class.<br\/><br\/>The evidence of the prosecution as to Natividad was that he had gambled nearly every night for a considerable time prior to his arrest on the charge of vagrancy, in the saloon of one Raymundo, as well as in Hart's saloon; that Natividad sometimes acted as banker; and that he had pleaded guilty to a charge of gambling and had been sentenced to pay a fine therefor about two weeks before his arrest on the vagrancy charge.\u00a0 The defense showed that Natividad was a tailor, married, and had a house of his own; that he made good clothes, and earned from P80 to P100 per month, which was sufficient to support his family.<br\/><br\/>From this evidence it will be noted that each of the defendants was earning a living at a lawful trade or business, quite sufficient to support himself in comfort, and that the evidence which the prosecution must rely upon for a conviction consists of their having spent their evenings in regularly licensed saloons, participating in gambling games which are expressly made unlawful by the Gambling Act, No. 1757, and that Miller frequented a dance hall and houses of prostitution.<br\/><br\/>Section 1 of Act No. 519 is divided into seven clauses, separated by semicolons.\u00a0 Each clause enumerates a certain class of persons who, within the meaning of this statute, are to be considered as vagrants.\u00a0 For the purposes of this discussion, we quote this section below, and number each of these seven clauses.<br\/><blockquote>\"(1) Every person having no apparent\u00a0 means of subsistence, who has the physical ability to work, and who neglects to apply himself or herself to some lawful calling; (2) every person found loitering about\u00a0 saloons or dram shops or gambling houses, or tramping or straying through the country without visible means of support; (3) every person known to be a pickpocket, thief, burglar, ladrone, either by his own confession or by his having been convicted of either of said offenses, and having no visible or lawful means of support when found loitering about any gambling house, cockpit, or in any outlying barrio\u00a0 of a pueblo; (4) every idle or dissolute person or associate of known thieves or ladrones who wanders about the country at unusual hours of the night; (5) every idle person who lodges in any barn, shed, outhouse, vessel, or place other than such as is kept for lodging purposes, without the permission of the owner or person entitled to the possession thereof; (6) every lewd or dissolute person who lives in and about houses of ill fame; (7) every common prostitute and common drunkard, is a vagrant.\" <\/blockquote>It is insisted by the Attorney-General that as visible means of support would not be a bar to a conviction under any one of the last four clauses of this act, it was not the intention of the Legislature to limit the crime of vagrancy to those having no visible means of support.\u00a0 Relying upon the second clause to sustain the guilt of the defendants, the Attorney-General then proceeds to argue that \"visible means of support\" as used in that\u00a0 clause does not apply to \"every person found loitering about saloons or dram shops or gambling houses' but is confined entirely to \"or tramping or straying through the country.\"\u00a0 It is insisted that had it been intended for \"without visible means of support\" to qualify the first part of the clause, either the comma after <i>gambling houses<\/i> would have been omitted, or else a comma after <i>country<\/i> would have been inserted.<br\/><br\/>When the meaning of a legislative enactment is in question, it is the duty of the courts to ascertain, if possible, the true legislative intention, and adopt that construction of the statute which will give\u00a0 it effect.\u00a0 The construction finally adopted should be based upon something more substantial than the mere punctuation found in the printed Act.\u00a0 If the punctuation of the statute gives it a meaning which is reasonable and in apparent accord with the legislative will, it may be used as an additional argument for adopting the literal meaning of the words of the statute as thus punctuated.\u00a0 But an argument based upon punctuation alone is not conclusive, and the courts will not hesitate to change the punctuation when necessary, to give to the Act the effect intended by the Legislature, disregarding superfluous or incorrect punctuation marks, and inserting others where necessary.<br\/><br\/>The Attorney-General has based his argument upon the proposition that neither visible means of support nor a lawful calling is a sufficient defense under the last four paragraphs of the section; hence, not being universally a defense to a charge of vagrancy, they should not be allowed except where the Legislature has so provided.\u00a0 He then proceeds to show, by a \"mere grammatical criticism\" of the second paragraph, that the Legislature did not intend to allow visible means of support or a lawful calling to block a prosecution for vagrancy founded on the charge that the defendant was found loitering around saloons, dram shops, and gambling houses.<br\/><br\/>A most important step in this reasoning, necessary to make it sound, is to ascertain the consequences flowing from such a construction of the law.\u00a0 What is loitering?\u00a0 The dictionaries say it is idling or wasting one's time.\u00a0 The time spent in saloons, dram shops, and gambling houses is seldom anything but that.\u00a0 So that under the proposed construction, practically all who frequent\u00a0 such places commit a crime in so doing, for which they are liable to punishment under the Vagrancy Law.\u00a0 We cannot believe that it was the intention of the Legislature to penalize what, in the case of saloons and dram shops, is under the law's protection.\u00a0 If it be urged that what is true of saloons and dram shops is not true of gambling houses in this respect, we encounter the wording of the law, which makes no distinction whatever between loitering around saloons and dram shops, and loitering around gambling houses,<br\/><br\/>The offense of vagrancy as defined in Act No. 519 is the Anglo-Saxon\u00a0 method of dealing with the habitually idle and harmful parasites of society.\u00a0 While the statutes of the various States of the American Union differ greatly as to the <i>classification<\/i> of such persons, their <i>scope<\/i> is substantially the same.\u00a0 Of those statutes we have had an opportunity to examine, but two or three contain a provision similar to the second paragraph of Act No. 519.\u00a0 (Mo. Ann. Stat, sec. 2228; N. D. Rev. Codes, sec. 8952; N. M. Comp. Laws 1897, sec. 1314.)\u00a0 That the absence of visible means of support\u00a0 or a lawful calling is necessary under these statutes to a conviction for loitering around saloons, dram shops, and gambling houses is not even negatived by the punctuation employed.\u00a0 In the State of Tennessee, however, we find an exact \"counterpart for paragraph 2 of section 1 of our own Act (Code of Tenn., sec. 3023), with the same punctuation:<br\/><blockquote>\"*\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 or for any person to be found loitering about saloons or dram shops, gambling houses, or houses of ill fame, or tramping or strolling through the country without any visible means of support.\" <\/blockquote>A further thought suggests itself in connection with the punctuation of the paragraph in question.\u00a0 The section, as stated above, is divided into seven clauses, separated by semicolons.\u00a0 To say that two classes of vagrants are defined in\u00a0 paragraph 2, as to one of which visible means of support or a lawful calling is not a good defense, and as to the other of which such a defense is sufficient, would imply a lack of logical classification on the part of the legislature of the various classes of vagrants.\u00a0 This we are not inclined to do.<br\/><br\/>In the case at bar, all three of the defendants were earning a living by legitimate methods in a degree of comfort higher than the average.\u00a0 Their sole offense was gambling, which the legislature deemed advisable to make the subject of a penal law.\u00a0 The games in which they participated were apparently played openly, in a licensed public saloon, where the officers of the law could have entered as easily as did the patrons.\u00a0 It is believed that Act No. 1757 is adequate, if enforced, to suppress the gambling proclivities of any person making a good living at a lawful trade or business.<br\/><br\/>For these reasons, the defendants are acquitted, with the costs <i>de oficio<\/i>.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres<\/i> and <i>Carson, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><i>Johnson and Moreland, JJ<\/i>., concur in the result.<br\/><\/div>",

but holding, as we do, that the trial court erred in rejecting 235 ballots which were cast in the precint of Dumarab and counted by the canvassing board in favor of Altavas, we have not found it necessary to make specific rulings on the various contentions of counsel, except only in so far as they relate to votes cast in that precinct.\u00a0 Counsel for appellee practically concedes that the case necessarily turns on our ruling as to the 235 marked ballots found in the ballot box from Dumarao, and we have examined the contested ballots cast in the other precincts of the province sufficiently to satisfy ourselves that no changes which we might make in the findings of the trial judge as to them, upon a full review and recount, would affect the final result so as to deprive Altavas of a majority of the total number of the votes cast at the election, after crediting him with the 235 ballots from the Dumarao precinct which were rejected by the court below.<br\/><br\/>Four\u00a0 hundred and two votes were cast at Dumarao, of which 235 were counted by the board of canvassers in favor of Altavas and 167 in favor of Hontiveros.\u00a0 When the ballot boxes were opened in the court below every ballot cast in favor of Altavas was found to be marked, while not a single ballot cast in favor of Hontiveros bore any mark of any kind.\u00a0 The principal contention throughout these proceedings is as to whether the marks on the votes cast in favor of Altavas were placed on the ballots by the voters themselves or with their authority, and before they were placed in the ballot box, as contended by Hontiveros; or whether as contended by Altavas, the marks were placed on these ballots without the knowledge or consent of the voters, by some person or persons who sought to invalidate them, and thus secure their rejection on a recount.<br\/><br\/>After an exhaustive and painstaking review of all the evidence of record, we are of opinion and so hold: <ol> <li>That the evidence of record conclusively establishes that the great majority of the <i>marks<\/i> found on the ballots cast in the precinct of Dumarao were placed on these ballots by some person or persons without the knowledge or consent of the voters who cast them.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>That by a clear preponderance of the weight of the evidence it appears that <i>all of these marks<\/i> were placed on these ballots by some person or persons without the knowledge or consent of the voters who cast them; that they were placed on the ballots after they had been cast and counted by the election judges; that they were placed on the ballots maliciously, for the purpose of invalidating then on a recount; and that they were not intended to serve any purpose as marks of identification of the voters who cast them.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>That by a clear preponderance of the weight of the evidence it appears that the 235 ballots from the precinct of Dumarao which were rejected on the recount by the court below as marked ballots were lawfully cast in favor of Altavas, the appellant in these proceedings, and were properly counted in his favor by the board of canvassers.<\/li><\/ol>Reserving the right to any member of the court to file hereafter an extended\u00a0 opinion discussing at greater length the grounds on which our judgment is based, the judgment of the lower court should be reversed without costs in this instance to either party,\u00a0 and the court below should be directed to enter a new judgment in accordance with the above rulings.<br\/><br\/>Let judgment be entered reversing the judgment of the court below and directing that court to enter a new judgment wherein the result announced in the former judgment will be changed by counting 235 votes from the Dumarao precinct in favor of Altavas, and wherein provision will be made for the issuance of the appropriate\u00a0 mandate in conformity with the changed result in the count of vote3.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

The second, third, and fourth alleged errors may be considered together.\u00a0 The facts are these:\u00a0 The ballots were deposited on June 4, and the counting of the same commenced on the night of the 4th and continued until terminated.\u00a0 The first protest was filed on June 18.\u00a0 In this protest it was alleged that up to that time the provincial board of canvassers had not <i>determined<\/i> who had been elected provincial governor.\u00a0 No proceedings pertinent to the questions here involved were taken in the Court of First Instance until August 10.\u00a0 The provincial board of canvassers met on July 12 and proceeded with a canvass of the returns from the various voting precincts.\u00a0 On that date they completed the canvass of the returns in so far as the offices of delegates to the Assembly and the provincial governor were concerned, and stated that owing to the lateness of the hour they would adjourn until the following day, the 13th, without having canvassed the returns for third member.\u00a0 On the 27th of that\u00a0 month the\u00a0 appellee presented what he called an \"amended protest\" and asked permission of the court to substitute this \"amended protest\" for the one filed on June 18.\u00a0 This permission was granted.\u00a0 The \"amended protest\" is complete in every particular, and it is not necessary to take into consideration for any purpose the protest filed on the 18th of June.\u00a0 In fact, this latter protest was never drawn in question thereafter, or referred to\u00a0 for any material purpose during the trial of the cause in the court below or in this court, except for the purpose of determining from what date the two weeks within which the protest might be filed, as provided in section 27 of Act\u00a0 No. 1582 as amended, should begin\u00a0 to run.\u00a0 Copies of the\u00a0 \"amended protest\" were served upon all the candidates voted for on June 4.\u00a0 The word \"candidates\" as here used is restricted to those persons who had filed certificates of candidacy with the authorities and who had not on June 4 withdrawn their candidacy.<br\/><br\/>Upon the foregoing facts, the question to be decided is (<i>a<\/i>) whether the time within which the motion which introduces an election contest for a provincial governorship expires two weeks after the day upon which the ballots are cast or two weeks after the day upon which the provincial board of canvassers determines who has been elected; and (<i>b<\/i>) in computing the time, should the first or the last day be excluded from the computation?<br\/><br\/>This is not the first time that this question has been under consideration by this court.\u00a0 It was directly involved and after a thorough investigation and extended, discussions, it was answered in two cases. (Navarro <i>vs<\/i>. Veloso, 23 Phil. Rep., 625; Manala <i>vs<\/i>. Sevilla, <i>ante<\/i>, 609.)\u00a0 In these cases we held that the two weeks begin to run <i>from<\/i> the date of the proclamation of the provincial board of canvassers and not from the day the ballots were cast.\u00a0 This question is no longer an open one in this jurisdiction, and if our attention had not been called to a number of adjudicated cases in the United States which it is claimed hold differently, we would say no more upon the question.\u00a0 But in view of these citations, we deem it advisable to somewhat further discuss the matter.\u00a0 Our further remarks, however, will be confined to an attempt to distinguish between the cases relied upon and the law and the conditions in our own jurisdiction.<br\/><br\/>It is believed that no one will disagree with the statement that the Legislature is presumed to have used words in their natural and commonly accepted meaning unless that meaning would contravene the manifest intent of the enactment.\u00a0 In State <i>vs<\/i>. McCoy (2 Marv,, 576; 43 Atl., 270,\u00a0 273) it is said:<br\/><blockquote>\"An election, under the Constitution, involves every element necessary to the complete ascertainment of the expression of the popular will, embracing the entire range, from the deposit of the ballot by the elector up to the final ascertainment and certification of the result.\u00a0 An election by the people means and includes the perfect ascertainment of such result.\"<\/blockquote>In Norman <i>vs<\/i>. Thompson (73 S. W., 62-64; 96 Tex., 250) and in <i>Ex parte<\/i> Conley (Tex.) (75 S. W:, 301,\u00a0 302) it was held that the word \"election,\" as used in Revised Statutes, section 3397, providing that, after the result of an election under the local option law has been declared, the election may be tested, and that if it appear that it was illegal or fraudulently conducted, or such a number of voters were denied the privilege of voting as might have changed the result, or the true result of the election cannot be ascertained, \"another election shall be ordered,\" means the act of casting and receiving the ballots from the voters, counting the ballots, and making the returns thereon.\u00a0 (State <i>vs<\/i>. Tucker 54 Ala., 205, 210.)\u00a0 That is the meaning of the word \"election\" in the ordinary usage, and it must be so construed, there being nothing in the law to suggest that the Legislature intended to use it in a different sense.\u00a0 (3 Words and Phrases, p. 2334.)<br\/><br\/>The treatise on the subject of \"Elections\" in 15 Cyc, 279 <i>et seq<\/i>., defines the word as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"An election is the embodiment of the popular will, the expression of the sovereign power of the people.\u00a0 In common parlance an election is the act of casting\" and receiving the ballots, counting them, and making the return.\"<\/blockquote>If this be the only meaning of the word, there is little room for doubt as to the meaning of the term \"after the election\" as used in section 27.\u00a0 But it is insisted that the word is used in numerous places throughout the Act to designate only the day and the operation of casting the ballots by the duly qualified voters.\u00a0 From this source is derived the chief if not the sole reliance of the advocates of the contrary construction.\u00a0 In view of the speciousness of this argument and the tenacity with which it is maintained, we are not disposed to set it aside upon the mere strength of a lexicographer's definition of the word \"election.\"\u00a0\u00a0 We shall endeavor to show that it is also inappropriate to the\u00a0 manifest intention of the Legislature.<br\/><br\/>Section 3 probably gives more color to the argument in question than any other.\u00a0 In it we find (quoting from the original act) such expressions as the following:<br\/><blockquote>\"An <i>election<\/i> to elect such delegates <i>shall be held<\/i> upon the thirtieth day of July, 1907.<br\/><br\/>\"Subsequent <i>elections<\/i> for such delegates <i>shall be held<\/i> on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November of 1909, and of each odd-numbered year thereafter.<br\/><br\/>\"An election for provincial governor and\u00a0 third member of the provincial board <i>shall be held<\/i> on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November of\u00a0 1907, and upon the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November of each odd-numbered year thereafter.<br\/><br\/>\"An <i>election shall be<\/i> held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday\u00a0 of November of 1907, to elect municipal presidents\u00a0 and vice-presidents.\"<\/blockquote>At first blush it would appear that the word \"election\" as used in these excerpts is confined to the day upon which those enjoying the right of suffrage are called to the polls to express their choice of candidates; or, in other words, that it is equivalent to the\u00a0 expression \"election day\" as used in section 10.\u00a0 But although the statute requires that an election be held upon that day, it does not require that it be concluded upon that day.\u00a0 Subsequent sections of the act show this most clearly.\u00a0 Section 21 is the section which, as a matter of fact, provides for the actual operation of depositing the votes.\u00a0 It is there provided that the duly qualified electors shall have access to the polls \"from seven o'clock in the morning until live in the afternoon.\"\u00a0 It also provides the method by which the ballots shall be deposited.\u00a0 If this is the only meaning of the word \"election\" as used throughout the act, what relation to an election must be attributed to the operation described in a subsequent section (No. 25) entitled\u00a0 \"counting the votes; announcement of the results?\"\u00a0 We started with a definition which contained the statement:<br\/><blockquote>\"An election is the embodiment of the popular will, the expression of the sovereign power of the people.\"<\/blockquote>In 3 Words and Phrases (p. 2329 <i>et seq<\/i>.)t under the title Elect-Elected-Election, a large number of definitions, pivoting upon the words \"a choosing or selection of one from among others\" may also be found.\u00a0 It is difficult to conceive of any of the essential subdivisions of this act of choosing being excluded from the operation of the term which concretely expresses this act of the\u00a0 people, i. e., \"election.\"\u00a0 We apprehend that no one would have the temerity to say that the counting of the votes is unnecessary to an election.\u00a0 Yet that it is not indispensable to a valid election to conclude this operation during the day upon which the\u00a0 election is \"held\" is evident by section 24 itself, wherein it states that \"if, by reason of the length of time required for the count\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 it shall be impracticable to return the same before midnight\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.\"\u00a0 Again, who will say that the formal announcement by the board of canvassers is not essential to an expression of the popular will?\u00a0 If the count may be concluded upon a subsequent day, <i>a fortiori<\/i> may the announcement of the result.<br\/><br\/>Section 25 provides that the provincial board shall sit as a board of canvassers to tabulate the statements prepared by the municipalities in accordance with section 24.\u00a0 Yet, that this canvass is indispensable to the election of a delegate to the Assembly or a provincial officer cannot be denied.\u00a0 The counting of the votes and the announcement of the results by the municipal officers, and the canvass by the provincial board are integral parts of the election, and the word cannot, therefore, be confined to the day upon which the ballots were cast.\u00a0 We think it too clear for argument that the Legislature in saying that an election should be held on a specified date intended only to convey the idea that the initial operation of selecting the candidate should start upon that day.\u00a0 The expression is thus used so frequently and with this certain meaning in all election statutes as to practically amount to an idiom of language, \"the meaning of which as a whole cannot be derived from the conjoined meanings of its elements.\"<br\/><br\/>Keeping in mind the meaning of the word \"election\" as above set forth, let us examine some of the authorities called to our attention.\u00a0 At the outset it is well to quote the following from\u00a0 Topacio <i>vs<\/i>. Paredes (23 Phil. Rep., 238):<br\/><blockquote>\"The utmost care must be exercised in the citation of authorities in support of any particular contention in the interpretation of election laws.\u00a0 They are universally statutory and seldom similar\u00a0 in\u00a0 the matter of election controversies.\u00a0 A single statutory or constitutional provision may render worthless as an authority the best considered case coming from some other jurisdiction on the point under discussion.\"<\/blockquote>The period within which a statutory contest by a defeated candidate may be instituted differs in the\u00a0 various States, not only as to the length of time allowed, but also as to the designated date that it shall start to run.\u00a0 The latter is the only point with which we are herein concerned.\u00a0 It is submitted that a provision of law requiring that the period shall commence to run \"after the official counting of the votes\" (Montgomery <i>vs<\/i>. Dormer, 181 Mo., 5; 79 S. W., 913), \"after return day\" (Carbis <i>vs<\/i>. Dale, 23 Utah, 463; 65 P., 204), and other similar expressions which clearly designate a time included within the term \"election\" and precede the final steps necessary to the election of a candidate are not equivalent to the phrase \"after the election\" as used in our own statute; for, as we have seen, the scope of the term \"election\" includes every step necessary to the choice of a representative by the people, from the casting of the ballots to the certificate of election.\u00a0 However correctly these phrases were construed in the cases, and there are a number of them in the books, it is submitted that the tribunals which\u00a0 prepared them were not considering the phrase \"after the election.\"\u00a0 These cases are not, therefore, in point.<br\/><br\/>It is claimed that the case of Carlson <i>vs<\/i>. Burt (111 Cal., 129, 131) is in conflict with our holding.\u00a0 The law under discussion in that case read as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"When an elector contests the right of any person declared elected to such office, he must, within forty days <i>after the return day<\/i> of such election, file with the county clerk a written statement, etc.\"<\/blockquote>In the course of the decision it was expressly decided that \"return day\" was prior to the determination by the board of canvassers of who was elected.\u00a0 It is therefore not understood how the requirement that a protest be filed \"after return day\" can be equivalent to the requirement that it be filed \"after the election.\"\u00a0 If it can, then any intermediate step necessary to a valid election, such as the casting of the ballots, the counting of the ballots, or the official declaration by the local authorities\u00a0 of the number of votes cast in a precinct may be deemed equivalent to the election of a person to office; in other words, a part is equal to the whole.\u00a0 We conclude that this case is not in point.<br\/><br\/>The case of Belden <i>vs<\/i>. Sherburne (27 La. Ann., 305), also cited, is, however, exactly in point.\u00a0 The phrase used in the law\u00a0 which the court construed\u00a0 in that case was <i>totidem verbis<\/i> the one found in our own statute.\u00a0 The court in that case dismissed a protest filed more than ten days subsequent to the day the ballots were deposited, but within ten days of the announcement of the results.\u00a0 But it must be remembered that this was a contest for a municipal office, and that the returns were doubtless known within a day or two at the most after the ballots were cast.\u00a0 The positive injustice of not allowing the candidate time to ascertain the result of the election before filing his contest was not, therefore, before the court.\u00a0 It is also a fact that this case is some forty years old, and further that the law in that State has now been changed to read \"after the promulgation of the result of said election,\" thereby indicating that the legislature arrived at the conclusion that it was not advisable to date the period from the day the ballots were cast.\u00a0 (Revised Laws of La., \u00a7 1419.)\u00a0 Nor does the case appear to have been thoroughly considered by the court.<br\/><br\/>An investigation\u00a0 of the statutes of the various States shows that in most of them where a statutory proceeding for contesting elections is provided, the time within which such a proceeding may be instituted commences to run \"after' the result of the election\u00a0 has been\u00a0 determined;\" \"after the person whose election is contested is declared elected;\" \"within thirty days after the official promulgation of the result of said election;\" \"within twenty days after the day the incumbent was declared elected,\" etc.\u00a0 In those few States where the wording is \"after the election\" it is most probable that the question has seldom if ever arisen under the\u00a0 conditions of the case at bar, <i>i e<\/i>., where the official returns were not public\u00a0 property\u00a0 within the time allowed.\u00a0 The facilities for communication in all parts of the United States are such that the result of an election is known most often by daylight of the day following the election day, and the candidate, therefore, has at least unofficial knowledge as to whether he has been elected or not.\u00a0 Furthermore, the time allowed for the filing of a protest is generally sufficient to\u00a0 extend far beyond the time the official returns are made known.\u00a0 For these reasons, the proposition that a candidate may be deprived of his right to institute a contest from lack of information, either official or unofficial, of the result of the election, has probably never been actually presented to the courts of the United States.\u00a0 Probably no better illustration of this fact can be found than the following from the California case of Carlson <i>vs<\/i>. Burt (111 Cal., 129, 133), which we have discussed above:<br\/><blockquote>\"To the suggestion that the board may take more than forty days to canvass the votes, it may be said that it may be possible, but it is quite improbable.\u00a0 If it should take much more than forty days the vote would not be canvassed until the term for which officers are to be elected will begin.\u00a0 Such a contingency was not anticipated, and can rarely happen, except through a criminal\u00a0 intent.\u00a0 The presumption is that in fixing the election at a certain period before the commencement of the terms of office, and\u00a0 in limiting the period for the commencement of a contest, <i>the legislature has taken all these things into consideration, and has concluded that the period fixed will always prove sufficient, and I believe that in practice it always has.\"<\/i><\/blockquote>In this jurisdiction the contingency which the California court terms as possible but quite improbable is a reality.<br\/><br\/>It is a well-known fact that all the returns from the various municipalities in some of the provinces of this Archipelago could not reach the capital within two weeks time, with the consequence that no one can know, either officially or unofficially, which candidate was successful in those provinces within two weeks after the day upon which the ballots are cast.\u00a0 Nor was it ever the expectation of the legislature that such a result could be accomplished.<br\/><br\/>Even the authorities in the United States agree with our holding that there cannot be a contest until it is known who has been elected.\u00a0 (Bowler <i>vs<\/i>. Eisenhood (S. D.), 12 L. R. A., 705; Hill <i>vs<\/i>. Holdam, 120\u00a0 Ky., 660,)\u00a0 If this be true, it is simply depriving a candidate of his right to a hearing to hold that the two weeks commence to run immediately after the day upon which\u00a0 the ballots are cast.\u00a0 Did the Legislature intend any such consequences ?\u00a0 The term \"after the election,\" as we have shown, may be construed in a manner which will best conform to the literal and common meaning of the words used and at the same time really allow the candidate two weeks within which to file his protest.\u00a0 The construction we have rejected not only assigns to the word \"election\" a significance not warranted by any available definition of the term, but makes of the two weeks period within which a protest may be filed a mere catch word; an illusion which disappears before the candidate can use it, and which deprives him of a hearing.\u00a0 Which of the two constructions should a court adopt?\u00a0 The one is practical, just, and adequate for the purpose in view.\u00a0 The other has nothing to recommend it.\u00a0 We are of the opinion that the phrase \"after the election\" can only mean after the last step necessary to a valid election, which is the proclamation or certificater of the provincial board of canvassers.<br\/><br\/>The extract of the minutes of the provincial board appearing in the record gives a tabulated statement of the votes cast for the offices of delegate to the Assembly for the first, second, and third Assembly districts, respectively, and for the office of provincial governor, and then concludes with a resolution to the effect that the candidates receiving the highest number of votes for each office (naming the candidate and office in each case) are declared elected.\u00a0 In other words, the board did not, on July 12, as provided by law, (1) make a canvass of all the votes cast in the province, (2) make one statement of all votes cast for each candidate for the Assembly in each Assembly district, (3) make one statement of all the votes cast for provincial officers, and (4) <i>upon the completion of this work<\/i> determine who was\u00a0 elected to each office.\u00a0 What the board actually did do on July 12 was (1) make a canvass of all the votes for members of the Assembly and for provincial governor, (2) make one statement of all the votes cast for each candidate for the Assembly in each Assembly district, (3) make a statement of all the votes cast for <i>provincial governor<\/i>, and (4) upon the completion of this work determine who was elected as delegate to the Assembly from each Assembly district, and who was elected provincial governor.\u00a0 It had not terminated its duty as a board of canvassers.\u00a0 The task of compiling the votes cast for the office of third member of the provincial board and announcing the result was still to be undertaken.\u00a0 In announcing the\u00a0 returns for some of the offices before the two statements required of it were made, the board departed from the letter and the spirit of the law.\u00a0 It being a plain\u00a0 provision of section 25 that the two statements in question must be prepared prior to the announcement of the results, it would seem unnecessary for this court to discuss the intention of the legislature in requiring this particular procedure.\u00a0 All the information necessary for a canvass of the votes for each of the offices being shown on the statements furnished by the different municipalities, the most logical procedure would seem to be that indicated by section 25, <i>i. e<\/i>., a tabulation at one time of all the returns for\u00a0 each office\u00a0 from each municipality.\u00a0 However, it is evident that the provincial board of canvassers had not completed its canvass on July 12.\u00a0 As we have held that the canvass is an integral part of the election, the election was\u00a0 not completed on July 12.\u00a0 The extract from the minutes of the board indicates that it was the intention of the board to take up the work of completing the canvass the following day, July 13.\u00a0 Whether this was the day upon which the election duties of the board were actually completed, the record does not show; but for the purposes of this case we shall assume that it was.\u00a0 This date, then, July 13, was the date upon which the election terminated.\u00a0 The law provides that a protest must be filed within two weeks after the election.\u00a0 (Sec. 27.)\u00a0 The two weeks period in this case,\u00a0 therefore, dates from July 13.\u00a0 The second protest in the present case was filed on July 27.\u00a0 It is insisted that in computing the two weeks the \"first day must be included and the last day excluded.\u00a0 Under this theory\u00a0 it is claimed that the protest came too\u00a0 late, having been made on July 27 instead of July 26 as required by law.\u00a0 The word \"after\" as here used must be understood to mean subsequent to the time of the announcement of the official returns; that is, none of the two weeks period precedes or is coetaneous with the announcement of the results.<br\/><blockquote>\"In computing time from or after a certain day, or a given date, or the day on which an act is done, the general rule is to exclude the day of the date, unless a different method of computation is clearly intended,\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 * \"\u00a0 (38 Cyc. 318.)<br\/><br\/>\"<i>Judicial proceedings generally<\/i>.-It has been stated generally that when any matter of practice or procedure is required by statute or order of court to be done within a certain number of days, the first day is excluded.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\"\u00a0 (Id., 321.)<\/blockquote>In view of these quotations and the long array of authorities cited in their support, and holding, as we do, that there are no facts in the present case to justify excluding it from the operation of the well-established maxim of law that there is no fraction of a day, we are of the opinion that the second protest of the appellee was filed within the two weeks allowed by law.<br\/><br\/>3. The fifth assignment of error raises the question as to whether the motion of protest filed on July 27 should date back to June 18, the date of the first motion, as being an amendment of the latter.\u00a0 It is urged that it does, and that the original protest being premature and conferring no jurisdiction on the court to consider the issues sought to be thereby raised, neither does the one filed on July 27.\u00a0 The proposition that a pleading performing the office of an amendment dates back to the date of the filing of the original plea is conceded.\u00a0 But that the name given to a pleading by counsel must govern its effect upon the cause before the court has not been demonstrated and, we think, is not capable of proof.<br\/><blockquote>\"The name given to a pleading is not controlling, but its character is always to be determined by its allegations.\" (31 Cyc, 46, and a long array of authorities.)<\/blockquote>The facts, as we have said, concerning the two motions in question are\u00a0 these:\u00a0 The election was held on June 4.\u00a0 The first motion of protest was filed on June 18, nearly a month before the announcement of the official returns by the provincial board of canvassers.\u00a0 It was admitted in paragraph 3 of this motion that the results of the election were not known; and in paragraph 4 it was stated that notwithstanding the lack of this information, if the official returns showed that the protestant had secured a less number of votes than his opponent Altavas, he desired to contest the election by means of this motion (of June 18).\u00a0 On July 27, after the board of canvassers had announced the results of the election, another motion was filed by the appellee which he termed an amendment to the motion filed on June 18.\u00a0 This second motion was accompanied by a formal request that it be admitted in\u00a0 substitution of the motion of June 18.\u00a0 An examination of the second motion shows that it is as a matter of fact a complete motion in itself.\u00a0 It alleges all the necessary jurisdictional facts for the institution\u00a0 of the contest in accordance with section 27; and, in much greater detail than the former motion, indicates the irregularities the contestant relies upon.\u00a0 It has not been contended that the pleading filed on July 27 is not complete in itself.\u00a0 Now, what was the reason of the appellee for filing the two motions?\u00a0 Simply this:\u00a0 He was uncertain whether the court would construe the requirement of section 27 that a protest must be filed within two weeks after the election would be construed by the court to mean two weeks after <i>election day<\/i>, or two weeks\u00a0 after the official announcement of the returns.\u00a0 As he did not wish to incur the risk of being deprived of his right to protest the election by attempting to determine which way the court would decide this question, he very wisely decided to be prepared.\u00a0 To this end he filed two motions, one of which would be within the two weeks period\u00a0 provided by law for the filing of a protest, no matter which way the court decided the question.\u00a0 We have said that this Supreme Court has definitely settled this question in the cases of Navarro <i>vs<\/i>. Veloso (23 Phil. Rep., 625) \"and Manalo <i>vs<\/i>. Sevilla (<i>ante<\/i>, 609).\u00a0 But neither of these cases had been decided when the case at bar arose; and prior to Navarro <i>vs<\/i>. Veloso the question had not been raised in this court.\u00a0 The dilemma in which the appellee found himself was, therefore, certainly not of his own making.\u00a0 The lower court evidently reached the conclusion that the two weeks period commenced to run from the day the ballots were cast, since it took cognizance of the motion and issued orders in the cause prior to the filing of the motion of July 27.\u00a0 The court was clearly in error in so doing.\u00a0 The court should have considered the motion of June 18 as premature and as conferring no jurisdiction whatever upon the court to try the issues sought to be raised.\u00a0 By so doing the appellee would have been advised of the steps necessary to be taken if he desired to contest the election, and would not have been led into the inadvertence of terming his motion of July 27 an \"amendment\" of his motion of June 18.\u00a0 Under these circumstances, and the motion of protest filed on July 27 being complete in itself and wholly sufficient to confer jurisdiction upon the court to hear the cause without reference to the one filed on June 18, we are clearly of the opinion that it should be considered not as an amendment to the one of June 18, but as an original protest.<br\/><br\/>4.\u00a0 In support of the sixth alleged error, it is insisted that the court committed a reversible error by directing the commissioners to open the ballots boxes and examine and recount the ballots without first requiring the protestant to make a <i>prima facie<\/i> showing of fraud or gross irregularities.\u00a0 This contention is based upon the proposition that there exists a presumption in favor of the legality of the election and the correctness of the returns.<br\/><br\/>The law provides that upon the institution of the contest the court \"shall forthwith cause the registry lists and all ballots used at such election to be brought before it and examined\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *.\"\u00a0 (Sec. 27.)\u00a0 The filing of the protest and the service of the same upon ail candidates voted for gives the court jurisdiction to proceed to a final determination of the case, and having once acquired such jurisdiction the court is expressly empowered to examine all the ballots.\u00a0 The ballots cannot be examined without opening the boxes.\u00a0 The law does not require a <i>prima facie<\/i> showing other than the allegations in the protest of\u00a0 fraud or\u00a0 irregularities in order to authorize the opening of the boxes.\u00a0 If the parties by agreement accept the returns from any precinct or precincts however, the necessity for the opening of the\u00a0 boxes would cease to exist as to them.\u00a0 In view of the plain provisions of section 27, it is not difficult to reach the conclusion that this alleged error is not\u00a0 well founded.<br\/><br\/>5. The seventh, eighth, and ninth alleged errors may also be considered together.\u00a0 The facts here pertinent are as follows:\u00a0 The trial of the contest began in the court below on August 10, when the court appointed W. M. Gracey, Sinforoso Salgado, and Jose M. Albar to examine and recount the ballots.\u00a0 These gentlemen were designated \"commissioners.\"\u00a0 Such designation, of course, added nothing to their powers, but there can be no serious objection to calling them by this name.\u00a0 Some time after the commissioners were appointed, the appellant asked the court to relieve Salgado and appoint one of his own selection.\u00a0 This the court declined to do.\u00a0 On this same day, August 10, the ballot boxes of Dumarao were brought into court and identified, but not opened.\u00a0 There appears to have been no session of the court on the 11th.\u00a0 On the 12th, during the examination of witnesses in reference to the identification of the ballot boxes from another town, counsel for the appellant asked the court if the boxes from Dumarao had been opened and the ballots examined and recounted.\u00a0 The court replied that he had ordered the ballot boxes opened and their contents examined and counted.\u00a0 The same counsel requested the court to permit him or an associate or the appellant and a representative\u00a0 from the other side to be present when the boxes were opened and the ballots examined and recounted by the commissioners.\u00a0 The court denied this request.\u00a0 Counsel insisted upon being granted this privilege and stated his reasons therefor, but the court would not change its ruling.\u00a0 Again, on September 7, the appellant asked the court that, in view of the fact that the appellee had concluded the taking of his testimony, the case be held open for the purpose of allowing him to introduce additional evidence in reference to the rejected ballots, claiming that the court had granted him authority to examine such ballots.\u00a0 The court then stated that it had not authorized the appellee to examine the ballots, saying that the authority to examine the ballots was granted to the commissioners, but that\u00a0 the attorneys in presenting their arguments might examine the ballots for the purpose of aiding them in such arguments.\u00a0 If the parties or either of them ever at any time saw and examined the rejected\u00a0 ballots or any other ballots, the record fails to disclose this fact.\u00a0 The commissioners\u00a0 performed their duties behind closed doors and permitted\u00a0 neither party to be present when the boxes were opened and the ballots recounted.<br\/><br\/>The correctness of this procedure is vigorously attacked by the appellant.<br\/><br\/>Section 27 provides in part as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Such court shall have exclusive and final jurisdiction, except as hereinafter provided, and shall forthwith cause the registry lists and all ballots used at such election to be brought before it and examined, and to appoint the necessary officers therefor and to fix their compensation\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 and to issue its mandamus directed to the board of canvassers to correct its canvass in accordance with the facts as found.\"<\/blockquote>It seems that to refuse to permit the parties to witness the examination and recount of the ballots is purely arbitrary.\u00a0 It is directly opposed to the fundamental principles which govern the introduction of evidence in the courts, and denies <i>pro tanto<\/i> the right of the parties to a hearing before judgment.\u00a0 How.ever unimpeachable the integrity of the commissioners in this case, we cannot sanction such a practice.<br\/><br\/>It also seems necessary to disapprove of the scope of the power delegated to the commissioners in this case.\u00a0 Section 27 plainly requires that the court \"shall forthwith cause the registration lists and all ballots used at such election to be brought before it and examined.\"\u00a0 We apprehend that this must be done in open court in the presence of the presiding judge and the interested parties.\u00a0 We do not conceive that there is any grant of judicial discretion here to the officers appointed by the court to determine whether or not a ballot is invalid because improperly executed or because it is marked.\u00a0 These officers have none of the powers of a referee (sec. 138 of the Code\u00a0 of Civil Procedure) or of commissioners\u00a0 in eminent domain proceedings.\u00a0 (Sec. 244, id.)\u00a0 As a matter of fact, there is no reason for terming the persons charged with the duty of opening and counting the ballots \"commissioners.\"\u00a0 The word used\u00a0 in the law is \"officers\" and the extent of their duties as set forth therein appears to be confined to the mechanical operation of opening the ballots and tabulating the count under the direct supervision of the court.\u00a0 In other words, their\u00a0 duties are merely clerical.\u00a0 If it be urged that an examination and recount of the ballots in the presence of the court would unduly\u00a0 prolong the hearing, especially in a contest over a provincial office where a large number of votes must be counted, we answer that that is an argument to be addressed to the Legislature and not to the courts.\u00a0 It would seem, however, that this objection might easily be overcome by an agreement between the parties to dispense with the attendance of the presiding judge at the actual counting of the\u00a0 ballots.\u00a0 The count could then proceed before the officers appointed by the court and all ballots the validity of which was not disputed by either party could be properly tabulated and disposed of by the officers of the court without the intervention of the court.\u00a0 This would reduce the actual labor of the court to an examination of the relatively small number of the ballots which were objected to by the parties.<br\/><br\/>The ruling made by the court denying the parties the right to witness the examination and recount of the ballots and to present evidence with reference to the legality of the questioned ballots\u00a0 constitutes reversible error.\u00a0 The record will therefore be returned for a reexamination and recount of the ballots by the court in the presence of the interested parties, or by an officer or officers appointed by the court, also in the presence of the interested parties.\u00a0 If this latter method is pursued, all ballots\u00a0 questioned by either party must be submitted to the court, who will determine the validity of such ballots after the evidence has all been presented.\u00a0 In any case the questioned ballots should be segregated from the valid ballots by precincts and marked exhibits of the\u00a0 respective parties objecting thereto.\u00a0 The evidence presented on the rehearing will be strictly confined to the subject of the legality or validity of the questioned ballots.\u00a0 On the termination of the recount and the presentation of such evidence and\u00a0 the arguments of counsel, the court will, after an examination of the whole record-the old as well as the new testimony-render such judgment as in its opinion the law arid the merits of the case warrant.\u00a0 Upon this new hearing, however, the court will not take into consideration the election held in the first precinct of the town of Libacao for the reason that that part of the judgment\u00a0 appealed from rejecting or annulling the election in this precinct is hereby affirmed upon the reasons stated in said judgment.<br\/><br\/>Judgment will be entered forthwith and the record returned to the court below for the purposes set forth in this decision.\u00a0 No costs will be allowed in this instance.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Gaz., 139), prescribed the months of\u00a0 March, April, and May, 1911, as the period within which land taxes were payable in the Province of Misamis.\u00a0 No executive order was issued in 1911 with reference to the payment of taxes in that province in 1912, hence under the provisions of section 15 of Act No, 1791 and of the above mentioned executive order issued in 1910 the months of March, April, and May constituted the period during which the taxes were payable in that province in 1912.<br\/><br\/>It is further provided by section 15 of Act No. 1791 that:\u00a0 \"After such term is so fixed the provincial treasurer shall select a period of not less than one nor more than three weeks during such term, within which said taxes shall be payable at the office of the provincial treasurer in the municipality,\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *:\u00a0 <i>Provided<\/i>, That in municipalities in which the municipal treasurer is a deputy of the provincial treasurer the collection period for each year shall cover the entire three months ending the day before the tax becomes delinquent.\"<br\/><br\/>It does not appear from the record in this case whether the municipal treasurer of Mambajao, Province of Misamis, was a deputy of the provincial treasurer or whether the provincial treasurer selected a period of \"not less than one nor more than three weeks\" during which taxes were to be paid in that municipality.\u00a0 If the municipal treasurer of Mambajao was in fact the deputy of the provincial treasurer, then the period or term within which taxes were payable in that municipality in the year 1912 consisted of the months of March, April, and May.\u00a0 If the municipal treasurer was not the deputy of the provincial treasurer, then in the absence of proof of the selection or designation of\u00a0 a period of \"not less than one nor more than three weeks' by the provincial treasurer as provided above, it is clear that the taxpayers in that municipality could not be penalized for a failure to pay their taxes before the end of the month of May, 1912, and that they could not be held to be delinquents if they\u00a0 paid their taxes to the provincial treasurer at any time during the months of March, April, and May.<br\/><br\/>The evidence of record in this case discloses that the accused did not pay his taxes for the year 1911 until June 3, 1912, the day before the election, which would seem to indicate that at the time when he paid these taxes he had been delinquent for at least three\u00a0 days, But the charge against him is not that he was delinquent at the time when he actually paid his taxes, but that he was delinquent on the 4th day of May, when he subscribed his registration oath; and from what has been said, it is clear that the evidence does not sustain a finding that on that day he was a delinquent.\u00a0 True, he had not yet paid\u00a0 his taxes, but the mere failure to pay one's taxes does not render one delinquent until and\u00a0 unless the entire period has elapsed within which the taxpayer is authorized by law to make such payments without being subjected to the payment of penalties for failure to pay his taxes within the prescribed period. (U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Estavillo, 19 Phil. Rep., 478.)<br\/><br\/>The record contains a certificate of the municipal treasurer to the effect that the accused was delinquent (<i>en mora<\/i>) on the day when he subscribed his registration oath.\u00a0 But so far as the record\u00a0 discloses, the municipal treasurer did not testify before the trial judge and no opportunity was given either the court or the accused to ascertain the grounds upon which he based his opinion in this regard.\u00a0 The mere certificate of the treasurer, even if it be considered as evidence admitted without objection at the trial, is not sufficient to establish the allegation as to the delinquency of the accused.\u00a0 In order to establish this allegation\u00a0 it was incumbent on the prosecution to offer proof of all the necessary facts upon which a finding of the delinquency of the accused could be predicated\u00a0 beyond a reasonable doubt.\u00a0 As we have shown, the mere fact that the accused had not paid his taxes for the year 1911 when he took his registration oath is not conclusive proof of\u00a0 his delinquency on that date, and as we have indicated so far as can be gathered from the other evidence of record, it affirmatively appears that the failure to pay his taxes for the year 1911 could not have rendered him delinquent until the 1st day of June.<br\/><blockquote>\"To constitute a legal 'delinquent tax' on land, three things are necessary; (1) That the land is subject to taxation; (2) that a tax authorized by law has been levied on it in a manner provided by law; (3) that the tax remains unpaid after the time appointed for its\u00a0 payment.\u00a0 To make a tax delinquent each of these things must be shown; each is as essential as either of the others.\u00a0 (Chauncey <i>vs<\/i>.

It may be stated as a general rule that the decision\u00a0 by a court of one of the fundamental\u00a0 questions before it does not, except perhaps in cases involving a constitutional question,\u00a0 deprive\u00a0 it of\u00a0 jurisdiction\u00a0 whichever way it\u00a0 may decide. . Jurisdiction is the authority to hear and determine a cause, the right to act in a case.\u00a0 Since it is\u00a0 the power to hear and determine, it does not depend either upon the regularity of the exercise of that power or upon the rightfulness of the decision made.\u00a0 Jurisdiction\u00a0 should be distinguished from the exercise of jurisdiction.\u00a0 The authority to decide a case at all.and not the decision rendered therein is what makes up jurisdiction.\u00a0 Where there is jurisdiction of the person and the subject matter, the\u00a0 decision of all other questions arising\u00a0 in\u00a0 the case is but\u00a0 an exercise of that jurisdiction.\u00a0 (Herrera <i>vs.<\/i> Barretto,\u00a0 25 Phil. Rep., 245; Gala <i>vs.<\/i> Cm, 25 Phil. Rep., 522; De Fiesta <i>vs.<\/i> Llorente, 25 Phil. Rep., 554.)<br\/><br\/>The writ of certiorari in so far as it was a method by which mere errors of an inferior court could be corrected no longer exists.\u00a0 Its place\u00a0 is now taken by the appeal.\u00a0 So long as the inferior court maintains jurisdiction, its errors can be corrected only by that method.\u00a0 The writ in this country\u00a0 has been\u00a0 confined\u00a0 to the correction of defects of jurisdiction solely and cannot be legally used for any other purpose. (Id.)<br\/><br\/>The fact that the complaint in the justice's\u00a0 court appeared in its phraseology somewhat like a complaint in\u00a0 ejectment, and\u00a0 that the judgment of the justice's court took on\u00a0 also something of the color of a judgment in such an action; and the fact that such judgment contains some provisions which\u00a0 a justice's court is perhaps\u00a0 without authority to insert in its judgments is of no particular consequence in the proceeding before us.\u00a0 If the judgment of the justice's court\u00a0 was void,\u00a0 it was nevertheless appealable, although the losing party might have\u00a0 been able to rid\u00a0 himself of it by other means.\u00a0 Having been appealed, it stands upon substantially the same footing in the appellate court, so far as the appeal itself is concerned, as any other judgment of a justice's court and the jurisdiction of the appellate court in that appeal\u00a0 is as full and complete as it is in any other.<br\/><br\/>It having\u00a0 been found that the contention of the respondents is correct, the petition is dismissed.

of the Court of Land Registration dismissing the opposition of the Roman Catholic Bishop of Nueva Caceres and declaring the State (Insular Government) to be the owner of the property described in the petition.<br\/><br\/>On the 22d of December, 1908, the municipality of Nueva Caceres, through its president, filed an application in the Court of Land\u00a0 Registration for the inscription under the Torrens Law of a parcel of land situated in that municipality, bounded on the north by a\u00a0 lane, on the east by the land of the cathedral church, on the south by the land of Basilio Cleto, and on the west by Calle Santa Cruz, containing an area of 376 square meters.\u00a0 Upon this lot a schoolhouse of strong materials was constructed between 1875 and 1878.<br\/><br\/>On the 25th of January, 1909, the Roman Catholic Church, represented by the, bishop of the diocese of Nueva Caceres, presented its opposition to the inscription of the above described lot on the ground that the schoolhouse and the land occupied by it were the exclusive property of the\u00a0 church.\u00a0 The Director of Lands, represented by the Attorney-General, also opposed the inscription of this property and alleged that the same belonged to the Insular Government.<br\/><br\/>The Insular Government and the municipality arrived at a compromise in regard to their conflicting claims, and it appears that the Insular Government notified the court of its intention to cede all its rights in the property to the municipality.<br\/><br\/>The church being the only appellant, now insists that the lower court erred in dismissing its opposition and in holding that the property sought to be inscribed belonged to the State.<br\/><br\/>The court having held that the property, both house and lot, belonged to the State, and the municipality not having appealed from this decision, is bound by it.\u00a0 The only question, therefore, to be determined is whether or not the house and lot are the\u00a0 property of the church or of the Insular Government.<br\/><br\/>Maria de la Cruz was the first known proprietor of the land in question, and her son Basilio Cleto and his wife, Paula Hernandez, about the year 1875, gratuitously ceded this lot to Francisco Gainza, bishop of the diocese of Nueva Caceres.\u00a0 Bishop Gainza founded the school in 1875, making it a school for boys exclusively, supervised its construction, and paid for all of the work performed on it.\u00a0 Until its completion in 1878 neither the municipality nor the Government took any part in its erection.\u00a0 A part of the material which was used in the construction of the school building was that left over after the completion of admittedly church buildings.\u00a0 After the foundation of the school, the bishop managed and directed it until his death, which occurred in the same year the building was completed.\u00a0 After his death Padres Mariano Villafuerte, Tomas Cari\u00f1o, Manuel Nabea, and other priests intervened in the management of the school as teachers and inspectors at different times.\u00a0 Carlos Sabio, who was a graduate\u00a0 of the Catholic seminary of Nueva Caceres, was in charge of this school as teacher in 1889 and 1890.\u00a0 The doctrine of the Roman Catholic faith was taught in the school from its foundation until the time of American occupation.\u00a0 At the time this building was constructed, and for several years thereafter, it was the only boys' school within the <i>poblacion<\/i> of Nueva Caceres, and the Colegio de Santa Isabel was the only girls' school there.\u00a0 This boys' school was familiarly known as the \"Escuela Publica\" by\u00a0 some, and as the.\u00a0 \"Escuela Pia\" by others.\u00a0 From the death of Bishop Gainza until the time of American occupation, this boys\u00a0 school was managed and directed by the Government (Insular, provincial, and municipal) and the church jointly, the former paying the teachers' salaries out of the local budget the greater part of the time.\u00a0 Since shortly after American occupation, this school has been in the exclusive possession and under the exclusive control of the Government, and has been known since that time as a public municipal school.\u00a0 The above facts are not contradicted.<br\/><br\/>The trial court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The opposition of the Apostolic Roman Catholic Church appears to be based on the fact that the bishop of Nueva Caceres had intervened in the construction of the said schoolhouse and according to the proofs, documentary and oral, there is no doubt of this fact.\u00a0 But as may be seen in the document Exhibit 2 of the opposition, there is no doubt but that the said bishop had intervened in the construction from the desire to help because of the interest on his part in public education.\"<\/blockquote>The court then quoted from Exhibit 2, which reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Pursuant to the program arranged with the worthy governor of this\u00a0 province for the celebration of the popular and traditional feast of Our Lady of the Pe\u00f1a de Francia, yesterday morning, after the close of the religious services in the beautiful and renovated sanctuary, accompanied by the\u00a0 alcalde himself, the civil and military officials, employees, and other Spaniards, not only of\u00a0 this city and the towns of this province but of many others in\u00a0 Albay, the secular clergy and some friars, curates of neighboring towns, the leading citizens and a great throng of people from neighboring towns, I had the satisfaction of dedicating and inaugurating the fine large municipal school for boys\u00a0 which your excellency saw quite well advanced on your visit to this city; on this occasion I thought\u00a0 proper to address the select audience in a short and rambling speech, a copy whereof I have the honor to remit herewith, should your excellency see fit to report this event to the Government of his Majesty the King, so that it may again\u00a0 be informed how the bishop of Nueva Caceres employs his time, energy, and the means at his disposal, without at the same time neglecting the duties of his high and holy ministry, final proof whereof is the profitable diocesan mission inspection he has just completed with the satisfactory result of over 40,000 confessions and communions in the towns visited and over 30,000 confirmations made in the three and a half months the inspection lasted.\"<\/blockquote>After which the court continued:<br\/><blockquote>\"It is clear, therefore, that the work done by the bishop was work apart and separate from his duties and obligations of his 'high and holy ministry.'\u00a0 Moreover, in the same document it is said that the\u00a0 schoolhouse is a municipal school for boys.'<br\/><br\/>\"In the report of buildings set apart for the public service in the capital of the Province of Ambos Camarines the schoolhouse in question is designated as being property of the Government, and that it is a school for boys; and the court has no doubt that said schoolhouse and the lot in question belong to the State and not to the opposing entity.\"<\/blockquote>From the foregoing it appears, although riot clearly, that the court was of the opinion that Bishop Gainza, in receiving the lot as a gift and constructing thereon the building, did so not as bishop of the diocese but in his private capacity, and that in his\u00a0 inaugural address ceded, donated, and dedicated the property in question to the municipality; and by reason of this cession or donation, the church parted with its title.\u00a0 The court reasons that this is true as is shown by the continued use and occupation of the premises by the municipality forever thereafter.<br\/><br\/>That the lot was gratuitously ceded to the Catholic bishop and that he built the schoolhouse thereon, is not disputed by anyone.\u00a0 Then,\u00a0 up to the time of the inauguration or dedication, either the bishop or the church was the owner in fee of both the lot and the building.\u00a0 Was it a part of the bishop's religious duty, as representative of the church, to assist in educating the young people of his diocese.?<br\/><br\/>According to Andres, the functions of a bishop were divided into two classes:\u00a0 (1) Rights and authority; and (2) duties and obligations.\u00a0 In his work (Diccionario de Derecho Can6nico, vol. 4, p. 70) he says:<br\/><blockquote>\"In order to reduce this extensive subject to a formula that may embrace everything without our falling into repetitions, we shall with some authors by way of recapitulation distinguish between what refers to the duties and obligations of the bishops and that which relates to their rights and authority.\u00a0 The duties of the bishops may easily be confused with their rights, for many things that were originally imposed as duties have come to be functions, the exercise whereof has been sought by many; such are the greater part of the functions relating to worship and the guidance of souls.\u00a0 Nevertheless, we think that we can and must make two separate articles; we treat here of <i>the rights<\/i> of the bishops in the general sense, and in the following paragraph we shall treat of <i>their obligations.<\/i><br\/><br\/>\"In the first place, we shall reduce the authority, rights, and functions of the bishops to three distinct divisions of the episcopal office, to wit, regulation, jurisdiction, and dignity.\"<\/blockquote>He then goes on to enumerate the rights and functions of the bishops, among which are those of <i>bendicion<\/i> and <i>consagracion,<\/i> and in discussing the jurisdiction of the bishop states that he must preside over the government of his church, and that he is in charge of all the ecclesiastical property of his diocese.<br\/><br\/>He then proceeds:<br\/><blockquote>\"Let us now see what their duties and obligations are:<br\/><br\/>\"They may be reduced\u00a0 to two principal objects, worship and the guidance of souls.\u00a0 Divine worship refers (1) to the faith and the respect due to God and his Saints; (2) to the celebration of divine services; (3) to the administration of the sacraments; and (4) to the ecclesiastical ministers, things, and places.\" (Andres,\u00a0 Diccionario de Derecho Canonico, vol. 3, p. 75.)<\/blockquote>The duty or obligation which the bishop of Nueva Caceres speaks of in the letter referred to was a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">visita<\/span> to the different parts of his diocese engaged in converting the people to the Catholic faith, thus falling under number one of the above subdivision.<br\/><br\/>And Andres, in referring to a <i>visita<\/i> (Diccionario de Derecho Candnico, vol. 4, p. 351)\u00a0 refers to it as an indispensable duty or obligation of the bishop, and states that the object of all <i>visitas<\/i> is to introduce the holy and Catholic doctrine.<br\/><br\/>Among the decrees of the Council of Trent we find the following mandate:<br\/><blockquote>\"If the patriarchs, primates, archbishops, and bishops cannot every year visit the whole of their dioceses because of the latter's great extent, either in person or through their vicar-general or their inspector, in case these are legitimately hindered from so doing, they should at least travel over the greater portion, in such manner that the whole inspection be completed either in person or through their inspectors in two years.\"\u00a0 (Andres, Diccionario de Derecho Canonico, vol. 4, p. 351.)<\/blockquote>The instruction of boys has been from the beginning of its organization one of the greatest cares of the Roman Catholic Church.\u00a0 Perujo, in his Diccionario de las Ciencias Eclesiasticas\u00a0 (vol. 4, page 230), tells us that such schools have existed since the first century when the evangelist, St. John, founded one in Ephesus.\u00a0 He also informs us that there were schools for all ages and that not only the doctrine of the Catholic faith was taught, but also all branches of knowledge; and that any person who desired might attend them, as they were not limited to any particular creed of faith and that each episcopal chair ordinarily had a school and a library adjoining.<br\/><br\/>And in Andres (idem, vol. 2, p. 287) in referring to the importance of schools, it is said:<br\/><blockquote>\"In spite of this, schools were always necessary for the instruction of youth; and even in Paris itself they were necessary for the poor and for those who did not aspire to the courses of the university; and therefore, the councils of those and subsequent times have provided for this need; such has always been the conviction of the\u00a0 advantages the instruction of youth produces.\u00a0 In this connection, the councils of Rouen, Narbonne, Aix, and Bordeaux may be consulted; the last-named, which was held in 1358, expressed itself in article 27 thus;<br\/><br\/>\" 'De scholis in proemio, recte quodam hujus soeculi sapiente literis mandatum est, nihil esse de quo concilium divinus iniri possit, quam de recta puerorum institutione: juventus enim est spes ac soboles republicae quae si dum adhuc tenera diligenter\u00a0 excolatur, maxime at merae suavitatis fructus feret; contra vero si negligenter, aut nullos, aut amarissimos.'<br\/><br\/>\"These councils charge the bishops to establish schools and to watch over the conduct and customs of the teachers.\u00a0 Nothing is more important than to prevent youth from imbibing evil doctrine, from being perverted by bad examples.\u00a0 It is well understood that these public schools, the establishment and control of which the councils entrusted\u00a0 to the bishops, were not so magnificent as those of which we have just been speaking, if we except the seminaries, which form a separate establishment, as we shall state in its proper place, and that they were looked down upon in spite of their necessity.<br\/><br\/>\"The schools for boys must be conducted by men and those for girls by women, without the boys and girls going to the same school at the same time; and the orders in this respect have done nothing more\u00a0 than confirm the decrees of the provincial and diocesan councils.\"<\/blockquote>Thus it will be seen that the founding of schools was not only one of the functions and duties of the bishop, but was as important as any of the other obligations which his ministry carried with it.\u00a0 It is therefore clear that the lot in question was ceded to the church, and that the schoolhouse was built for the church, and that neither was the private property of the bishop.\u00a0 Both belonged to the church at the time of the dedication.\u00a0 Has the church parted with the ownership of this property since that time, by donation, cession, prescription, or in any other manner?<br\/><br\/>That the school in question was administered by the Insular Spanish Government and the teachers' salaries paid out of the local budgets, is no argument that the church parted with the fee or possession of this property, nor is there anything strange about\u00a0 such a dual state of affairs when we read the orders and regulations relating to schools and see the cooperation of church and state in educational matters.\u00a0 As far as instruction and the interior running of the schools were concerned, the church had almost entire control.<br\/><br\/>Article 31 of the royal decree of December 20, 1863, provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"The chiefs of the province shall be provincial inspectors and they shall exercise their trust with the aid of a commission, presided over by the same, and composed further of the prelate of the diocese, or, in his absence, of the parish priest of the capital and of the alcalde mayor or the collector of revenue.\u00a0 The parish priests will be the\u00a0 local inspectors of primary instruction in their respective districts.\"\u00a0 (Quoted in Berriz' Dictionary of the Administration of the Philippines, vol. 3, p. 325.)<\/blockquote>Article 3 of the royal order of the 20th of December, 1863, in regard to the rules for the running of the interior part of the school provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"Before the fifth day of each month the teacher will send to the chief of the province a list of all the children in the school who were there on the day preceding, with an account of who pay for instruction, also those who have entered and left\u00a0 during\" the month, according to\u00a0 the form given, and a copy of the <i>daily register of attendance<\/i> for the same time.\u00a0 These documents must be\u00a0 countersigned by the parish priest, and to the said end the teacher will submit to him the books referred to.\"<\/blockquote>Article 6 of the same order says, in part;<br\/><blockquote>\"When any child frequently fails to attend the school without its parents giving notice of the reason therefor, the teacher shall so inform them, and if after this it continues to be absent in the same way, he shall notify the parish priest.\"<\/blockquote>Article 10 of the same order provides that at the hour assigned by the parish priest inspector, the men and women teachers shall come together with their pupils in the church and hear mass, during which they shall repeat a part of the rosary; that at seven the children shall go to their schools and repeat the prayers which the bishop of the diocese assigns; that in the afternoon the children shall again assemble in the church and do the same as they did on arriving in the morning, and that on leaving the school in the evening they shall take the cross to the church and from there retire to their respective homes; that on Sundays and feast days the boys shall go to mass, and afterwards they shall visit the parish priest.\u00a0 Conferences over the Christian doctrine and ethics shall be at the hour which he assigns.\u00a0 Every three months, on a day which the parish priest assigns, the teacher shall take the boys to confession and to receive the sacrament.<br\/><br\/>Article 12 of the same order provides in part:<br\/><blockquote>\"Chastisements shall be proportioned to the nature of the offenses, and shall be; (1) To stand or kneel for not over an hour; (2) to review the reading or writing lesson; (3) to stay in after school up to an hour,.writing or studying; and (4) any other moderate correction suited in the parish priest inspector's judgment to the nature of the offense.<br\/><br\/>\"In no case shall any chastisement not included in the foregoing article be imposed, and the teacher who violates this regulation shall be twice reprimanded by the parish priest, and if he does not\u00a0 correct himself he shall be suspended.\"<\/blockquote>Article 13 provides that the examinations in the schools in the different towns shall be presided over by the parish priest in union with the <i>gobernadorcillo<\/i> and two other persons named by the parish priest.<br\/><br\/>Article 14 provides that the regulations of this decree may be modified by the superior civil government, upon the recommendation of the superior commission of primary instruction.\u00a0 The parish priest shall inform that authority of the result and reforms necessary and especially in so far as it concerns the time spent in class work and the distribution of the classes.\u00a0 (Berriz, Dictionary of the Administration of the Philippines, vol. 3, p. 328, <i>et seq<\/i>.)<br\/><br\/>The circular of the superior civil government, dated August 30, 1867, says:<br\/><blockquote>\"Sufficient is a very brief statement of the duties of inspectors so that their seriousness may be understood.\u00a0 Principally, the local inspectors, who in the towns are the reverend and learned parish curates, look after the advancement of education.\u00a0 They are (1) to visit the schools as frequently as possible and see that the regulations are observed; (2) to reprimand the teachers who may commit any offense and suspend them when in his judgment they have erred to such an extent that they should no longer be permitted to manage the school, making report thereof to the provincial inspector; (3) to encourage the attendance of children at the school; (4) to give written orders regarding admission therein, stating whether the instruction should be free or paid for; (5) to propose through the provincial inspector whatever he may esteem suitable for fostering and improving primary instruction; and (6) to exercise over the teaching of Christian doctrine and ethics the supervision set forth in article 4.\"\u00a0 (Berriz, Diet. Admr. Phil., vol. 3, p. 338.)<\/blockquote>And we find in rule 2, contained in the above circular order of the civil government in regard to corrections and suspensions of teachers:<br\/><blockquote>\"This is the most delicate power which the <i>Reglamento<\/i> gives to inspectors.\"\u00a0 (Berriz, id., p. 342.)<\/blockquote>Rule 5 in regard to the betterment of the schools says:<br\/><blockquote>\"One error alone is sufficient to ruin a generation.\u00a0 Fortunately, as has already been said, the circumstance that the duties of inspectors are confided to the reverend and learned parish priests is a guaranty for the state and the parents that in religion and in morality, the cardinal bases of all solid instruction, no reforms of principle or of method will be arbitrarily introduced.\"\u00a0 (Berriz, id., p. 345.)<\/blockquote>All schools, both\u00a0 public and private, were under the direction and supervision of the Government, which provided rules and regulations for their administration, as in the case of the school of Santa Isabel, the only girls' school in Nueva Caceres, the ownership of which has never been questioned by the Government.\u00a0 The royal decree of 1875 provided especially for the administration of this school an in article 49 says:<br\/><blockquote>\"The expenses of the personnel and\u00a0 material for the normal school shall be met:\u00a0 (1) With the\u00a0 sums designated now in the provincial budgets for the personnel of the sisters of charity in charge of the teaching in the College of Santa Isabel and with those that are\u00a0 included for the increase of two women teachers; (2) with those which shall be designated in the municipal budgets for the maintenance of girl pupils and for the\u00a0 keeping up of the establishment; (3) with those which are included in the municipal budgets of Nueva Caceres for the practical school as the public school for girls.\"\u00a0 (Berriz, id., vol. 3, p. 317.)<\/blockquote>It will be\u00a0 seen that the above royal decree referred to the <i>Colegio<\/i> of Santa Isabel as a girls' public school.\u00a0 No one has ever questioned the ownership of the Catholic Church in this school, and the record shows that it is still in possession thereof.\u00a0 As in the case of that school, so in the case of the one under discussion, the salaries of the teachers and the expense of\u00a0 keeping up the school were provided for by the local budgets.<br\/><br\/>That the Crown of Spain always codperated with the Roman Catholic Church in educational as well as religious matters and assisted the church in every way possible is clearly set forth in the case of the Roman Catholic Church <i>vs<\/i>. Municipalites of Rizal (12 Phil. Rep., 639, 646), which says:<br\/><blockquote>\"Scarcely had the Indies been discovered when the Pope and the Crown of Spain began to manifest a deep interest in the religious and educational welfare of the people of the Indies.\u00a0 (Bull of Alexander VI of the 4th of May, 1493; also the bull of the 16th of December, 1501; Ordinance 5 (<i>a<\/i>) by the Council of the Indies, 1575, Law 10, title 1, book 1, of the Laws of the Indies, of the 1st of June, 1574;\u00a0 Law 14,\u00a0 title 2, book 1, of the Laws\u00a0 of the\u00a0 Indies, and many others, the collection of which may be found in volume 7 of the <i>Legislacion Ultramarina<\/i>, p. 476.)<br\/><br\/>\"From the reading of these various bulls and royal decrees and ordinances, it will be seen that the Government and the church\u00a0 were constantly working together for the advancement of\u00a0 the religious and educational welfare of the <i>Indios<\/i>.\u00a0 The Government lent its most enthusiastic support to the efforts that were made by the church in\u00a0 this regard, even to the extent of\u00a0 paying funds out of the public exchequer, together with funds contributed by the <i>encomenderos<\/i> and the people of the towns, for the purpose of erecting the magnificent Catholic churches existing\u00a0 everywhere throughout, the\u00a0 Spanish island possessions.\u00a0 While the Crown of Spain always reserved a certain control over the operations of the Catholic Church, yet no one can doubt that, when these <i>lands<\/i> were donated or designated and the edifices were erected thereon, it was the intention of the Crown that such lands and such edifices should be devoted absolutely to the use of the church.\u00a0 It is a well-known fact that, when a church\u00a0 edifice of\u00a0 the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church was once accepted, and dedicated for religious purposes, it thereafter could never be used for any other purpose.\"<\/blockquote>Not only were all schools under the supervision and regulation of the Government, public or private, but the churches themselves could not be built without the consent of the Spanish Government, and the expenses for their construction and maintenance, as well as the salaries of their pastors, were paid out of the royal exchequer.<br\/><br\/>\"Whereas it is our intention to erect, institute, found, and maintain all cathedrals, parish churches, monasteries, votive hospitals and churches, and religious and pious establishments\u00a0 where they may be necessary for the teaching, propagation, and preaching of the doctrine of our holy Roman Catholic faith, and to aid to this effect with our royal treasury in so far as possible, and to receive information of such places where they should be founded and are necessary, and the ecclesiastical patronage of all our Indies pertaining to Us:<br\/><blockquote>\"We command that there shall not be erected, instituted, founded, or maintained any cathedral or parish church, monastery, hospital\u00a0 or votive church, or other pious or religious establishment without our express permission, as provided in Law 1, title 2, and Law 1, title 3, of this book, notwithstanding any permission heretofore given to our viceroys or other ministers, which in this respect we revoke and make null, Void, and of no effect.\u00a0 Law 2, title 6,\u00a0 book 1.\"\u00a0 (Quoted in Barlin <i>vs<\/i>. Ramirez, 7 Phil. Rep., 41.)<\/blockquote>See also Ponce <i>vs<\/i>. Roman Catholic Church (210 U. S., 296, 62 L. ed., 1068).<br\/><br\/>Thus it will be seen that all institutions founded by the church, convents, seminaries, churches, hospitals, and schools, were under the supervision of the Government and easily came to be confused\u00a0 with and known as public institutions of the State.<br\/><br\/>Dean Milman, in his History of Latin Christianity (vol. 1, p. 507) says:<br\/><blockquote>\"The Christian churches succeeded to that sanctity which the ancient law has attributed to the temples; as soon as they were consecrated they became public property, and could not be alienated to any other use.\u00a0 The ground itself was hallowed, and remained so even after the temple had been destroyed.\u00a0 This was an axiom of the heathen Papinian.\"<\/blockquote>And Andres, in speaking of religious schools (vol. 2, p. 285), defines a school in his treatment of church schools as \"a public establishment where knowledge is taught.\"\u00a0 (Vol. 2, p. 286.)<br\/><br\/>Morales tells us in his Derecho Canonico (vol. 2, p. 245):<br\/><blockquote>\"The word 'church' has in this work a special meaning, for we take it only in a material sense, that is, as the spot or place devoted to divine services and to sacred objects.\u00a0 Therefore, it may be defined as the <i>public building<\/i> devoted to divine worship.\"<\/blockquote>And even the bishops and all the priests of the Roman Catholic Church were appointed by the Government of Spain.\u00a0 We take the following from Gomez Zamora, <i>Patronato Regio Espa\u00f1ol e Indiano<\/i>, p. 322:<br\/><blockquote>\"For convenience' sake, the patronage in the Indies enjoys very important privileges, such as the tithes, stipends and vacancies, indulgence money, etc., which will be\u00a0 discussed in Chapter XXII.<br\/><br\/>\"These imposts lay upon the patron the duty of defending the church (Law 4, Tit.\u00a0 XV, part 1), and moreover in the Indies of contributing\u00a0 to it, as is expressly provided in the bull of Alexander VI, November 16, 1501.<br\/><br\/>\"The presentation, which is the designation of clergy suitable for the vacant benefice or church, is made by the patron, in the case of\u00a0 the larger or canonical benefices; the others are made in the colonies by the vice-patron.\u00a0 (Laws 3 and 24, book 1, Tit. VI, Recop. de Ind.)\"<\/blockquote>And at pages 330 and 331 of the same author the following:<br\/><blockquote>\"By royal cedula of July 14, 1765, as the result of an appeal filed against the archbishop\u00a0 of Hispaniola\u00a0 by his chapter to the apostolic judge of Puerto Rico, and the appeal by force of law carried by the same chapter to the royal audiencia of the same\u00a0 island against the apostolic judge of Puerto Rico because he had refused to admit the appeal, the royal audiencia was informed:\u00a0 'It would have been surprising had you admitted said appeal, for you must remember, as that prelate did, the provisions of the laws, and that in no way did he act in this matter on his own authority but as my delegate, on the strength of the special character the bull of Alexander VI confers upon me as vicar and delegate of the Holy See; and by virtue Whereof my royal authority extends to intervention into whatever concerns the spiritual government of the Indies, so extensively that the Holy See confers upon me not only his representation in the economic concerns of the ecclesiastical branches and affairs but also in the litigious and jurisdictional, reserving to itself only the power of regulation, for which laymen are incompetent.'<br\/><br\/>\"By royal order of 1835,\u00a0 addressed to the Governor-General of the\u00a0 Philippines, it is provided that to allow resignation from\u00a0 ecclesiastical benefices pertains, under the laws of the royal patronage, solely to the vice-patron, and in no way to the prelates.\"<\/blockquote>Therefore, it will be seen from a reading of the above royal decrees and regulations governing the primary instruction of the boys, that boys' schools were under the direction and control\u00a0 of both the church and the state.\u00a0 It was only natural that the schools of the church should be governed by the general laws regulating primary instruction inasmuch as all the schools were under its supervision; and as by throwing open the school to the public, boys generally would be instructed in the faith, it was to\u00a0 the advantage of the church to make its schools as public as possible.<br\/><br\/>So, the fact that the Government intervened in the administration of the school in no way tends to show or prove that the church had ceded the building or the lot in question to either the local or\u00a0 central government of Spain in the Philippines.\u00a0 On the contrary, it would have been highly unreasonable that such should have been\u00a0 the case, for the\u00a0 church is very jealous of its property and especially of its educational institutions for the instruction of the young, and especially of a lot and building which faced its cathedral in Nueva Caceres and adjoined the same lot on which its seminary for the instruction of aspirants to the priesthood was built.\u00a0 In fact, there is no doubt that until the revolution and separation of church and state, brought about by the advent of American sovereignty, the church was in possession of the school in question, considering it as its own exclusive property.<br\/><br\/>It appears that there was a great scarcity of buildings for the use of public schools, as the instructions given the various parish priests in the above quoted circular letter of the central government of the 30th of August, 1867, (Berriz, Die. Admin. Phil., vol. 3, p. 346) call the attention of the parish\u00a0 priests to the fertile field offered by the lamentable conditions of the schools of primary instruction and the scarcity of public buildings for their use.<br\/><br\/>The town of Nueva Caceres wae, in all probability, unable to gather funds for instruction for either boys or girls; therefore, Bishop Francisco Gainza took it upon himself to provide for both of these schools and opened them to the public.\u00a0 This act of liberality on the part of the bishop in no way inferred, nor was it intended to infer, that he thereby ceded the fee of the lot and building of either the boys' or girls' school to the State.\u00a0 There is no donation or dedication to the State of any sort shown by the record.<br\/><br\/>That he referred to the school\u00a0 as \"La Escuela Municipal de Ni\u00f1os\" in the letter which has been introduced in evidence, shows in no way a cession or dedication to the municipality or to the state, nor can we infer from this phrase that the bishop intended that the municipality should have complete control or authority over the school, for the record shows that no one ever considered it as a municipal school.\u00a0 The only possible thing the bishop could have intended, as the evidence shows, was that the school\u00a0 founded by him should be open to the whole community, to every boy in the municipality, for those who could not pay, as well as for those who were able to pay.\u00a0 The record shows that the school was called \"La Escuela Pia,\" and it is remarkable to note that the only witness who really knew anything about the inside running of the school and its administration, Carlos Sabio, who was a teacher there in 1889, after taking a course in the seminary of Nueva Caceres, refers to the school throughout his testimony as \"La Escuela Pia,\" showing that this was really the designation applied to it by those more intimately acquainted with its curriculum.\u00a0 Sabio was the only witness in a position to know the character of the school in question.\u00a0 His testimony, shows that it was a religious school.\u00a0 No schools of the property of the Insular Government were known-by\u00a0 the name of \"Escuelas Pias,\" while on the other hand many of the primary schools belonging to the church were termed by laymen \"Escuelas publicas.\"\u00a0 It certainly cannot be contended that the church has lost its right to the property in question through prescription.<br\/><br\/>The evidence discloses that the church was commonly recognized in Nueva Caceres as the owner of the property in question, although it was being used for school purposes and was under the supervision of the Government.<br\/><br\/>Article 1942 of the Civil Code reads: \"Acts of a possessory character, performed by virtue of a license, or by mere tolerance on the part of the owner, are of no effect for establishing possession.\"<br\/><br\/>Article 444 provides that acts which are merely tolerated do not affect possession.<br\/><br\/>And again, at the time the lot was ceded to the Catholic Church it was in the possession of Basilio Cleto and his wife Paula Hernandez, who utilized it, as well as did Maria de la Cruz before them, for their own 'use and enjoyment.\u00a0 That there was a donation of the land to the church and that the school was built on the land at the expense and with the funds belonging to the bishop for the church, who exercised all the rights in regard to the land which an owner might exercise, there can be no question.\u00a0 The lower court apparently laid great stress on the fact that the schoolhouse in question was\u00a0 classified as a public school in the list of buildings devoted to the public service in the capital of Ambos Camarines.\u00a0 But this is not by any means conclusive evidence that the same was the\u00a0 property of the State.\u00a0 This list of buildings is dated October 27, 1885, in Nueva Caceres, is signed by the alcalde mayor of Camarines Sur and is entitled, \"Buildings devoted to the public service.\"\u00a0 It is not signed by any representative of the Catholic Church, and cannot be construed in any way as an admission of the church.\u00a0 The church never has denied that this school was open to the public and that like the other church institutions it was devoted to the interests of the public, but with the reservation that this public was a Catholic public.and that the school should remain under the control and be directed by the priests of the Roman Catholic\u00a0 Church; and that-the Catholic\u00a0 faith be taught therein.\u00a0 This school would not have been thrown open to the public in general but for the fact that the Roman Catholic faith was at that time the\u00a0 religion of the state, the only religious denomination in the country.\u00a0 Therefore, the only\u00a0 religion of the public.\u00a0 It was a Catholic public to whom the\u00a0 portals of this school were thrown open, and the regulations of the central government specifically ordered that the Catholic faith and only the Catholic faith should be taught in every such school.\u00a0 For this reason only, Bishop Gainza permitted all boys to enter, and, for the same reason, were all establishments belonging to the church, such as seminaries, hospitals, and schools, termed public\u00a0\u00a0 institutions.\u00a0 The very purpose and aim of the Catholic schools was to educate the young in the Catholic faith.\u00a0 Had a state of affairs\u00a0 existed which has been brought about by the advent of the American Government, with its tolerance of all religious doctrines, this school would not have been looked upon as a public institution; the Government would not have had the slightest voice in its administration.\u00a0 This whole question must be viewed from the standpoint of a dual government when the church and state were both supreme, and not from the standpoint of the relation of the church to the state at the present time.<br\/><br\/>We therefore conclude that the Church was in fact and in law in possession of the schoolhouse and the land occupied thereby until the advent of the American Government, and that it has never parted with the fee to the property in question.\u00a0 The judgment is reversed and the petition dismissed, without costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

S. Crossfield, judge, in favor of the plaintiff, Agustin J. Montilla, and against the Augustinian Religious Corporation of the Philippines, sued for the sum of P9,389, with interest thereon at the rate of 6 per cent a year from November 14, 1898, and the costs of the action.<br\/><br\/>On December\u00a0 15, 1911, counsel for the plaintiff filed a written complaint in the Court of First Instance of this city, alleging:<br\/><br\/>That on or about August 1, 1891, plaintiff and defendant executed a lease whereby the defendant ceded to the plaintiff the use and usufruct of the Pasay estate at an annual rent of P5,000, and at the same time authorized the lessee to collect from the tenants on said estate the arrears in rents previous to the lease, which defendant averred to be over P25,000, at a commission of 50 per cent thereof;<br\/><br\/>That on February 15, 1896, when the plaintiff was in lawful possession of said estate by virtue of the foregoing contract, he was arbitrarily and illegally dispossessed by the defendant, thereby suffering losses and damages;<br\/><br\/>That the plaintiff resorted to the courts of justice, and the defendant was sentenced by the Court of First Instance of Binondo, on May 12, 1896, to restore the plaintiff to possession of said Pasay estate, to pay the costs and damages, and to return the products and rents it had received;<br\/><br\/>That the defendant corporation appealed from that judgment, which was affirmed by the <i>Audiencia Territorial<\/i> of Manila on November 14, 1898, but as the plaintiff was absent from these Islands it was announced in open court, and up to the date of the filing of this complaint it has not been returned to the lower court for execution;<br\/><br\/>That on or about April 1, 1903, the plaintiff demanded extra judicially of the defendant corporation performance of the obligations to pay damages and to restore the products as declared\u00a0 in that judgment of the Audiencia of Manila, and he had to repeat his extrajudicial demands on September 24, 1903, and September 24, 1904, but although the defendant always promised to comply in a friendly way with its obligations, imposed by a final judgment, the truth is that to date it has not complied therewith, nor will it do so without a judicial decree;<br\/><br\/>That the plaintiff was entitled to possess said estate as lessee until April 12, 1897; and the losses and damages caused by the dispossession effected by the defendant corporation are herewith itemized:<br\/><blockquote><table border=\"0\" width=\"100%\"> <tbody><tr valign=\"top\"> <td width=\"5%\">(<em>a<\/em>)<\/td> <td

furniture and carriages at a great\u00a0 sacrifice and\u00a0 doing great injury to his credit, besides the consequences of a temporary and precarious situation in seeking new means of livelihood;<br\/><br\/>Wherefore, judgment is prayed in his favor and against the defendant corporation for the sum of P24,149.34, as losses and damages and products received, to which the defendant was sentenced by the judgment of May 12, 1896, affirmed by the Audiencia of Manila on November 14, 1898, with legal interest on said sum at the rate of 6 per cent a year from the date of said judgment, May 12, 1896, until payment and the costs.<br\/><br\/>The demurrer interposed by the defendant was overruled, whereupon it entered an exception and in reply to the foregoing complaint set forth that it generally and specifically denied each and all of the facts stated in the complaint and each and all of the paragraphs contained therein, with the sole exception of those that it expressly and with the necessary corrections admitted in special defense.<br\/><br\/>As its first special defense it alleges prescription, for the reason that long before the year 1891 and constantly since that time, without interruption, the defendant corporation has been and is a collective organization of religious character domiciled in the Philippine Islands and\u00a0 dedicated to the purposes of its establishment and not to commercial pursuits of any kind, as is falsely alleged in the complaint; that in order to further the purposes of its establishment the defendant possessed certain property which it managed and used therefor, among such a rural estate called the Pineda, or Pasay, estate, of its exclusive and lawful ownership; that on August 1, 1891, the plaintiff and the defendant corporation executed a contract for leasing said property for a period that should expire on December 31, 1895, and be extendible for two years more, if both parties so agreed, at the annual rent stipulated, with certain conditions, in the public instrument wherein said lease was recorded; that on the same date another contract was executed in a public instrument whereby the plaintiff undertook to attempt the collection of sums due the defendant as arrears in rents unpaid by the tenants an the estate, with a commission of so much per cent, which the plaintiff would receive from what he collected, and with the conditions stipulated\u00a0 in that instrument; that on December 31, 1895, the defendant considered the lease terminated and directed that in virtue thereof proclamations be issued so informing the tenants of the estate on January 16, 17, and 18, 1896, without protest or objection on plaintiff's part; that on March 23 of the same year, over two months after the publication of the proclamations, the plaintiff filed a complaint for recovery and retention of possession in the Court of First Instance of Binondo, alleging that by the publication of those proclamations the defendant had disturbed him in the possession he had enjoyed as lessee of the Pasay\u00a0 estate, which suit was decided on May 12, 1896, by directing that the plaintiff be immediately restored to the possession of the estate and sentencing the defendant to payment of the losses and damages caused by the dispossession; that eight days after that judgment the plaintiff was restored\u00a0 and protected in his possession, while the appeal entered by the defendant from that judgment was pending, and on November 14, 1898, the <i>Audiencia Territorial<\/i> of the Philippines\u00a0 affirmed the judgment appealed from, without special finding as to costs; that since the same was published until date it has remained final, with the force of <i>res adjudicata<\/i>, without fulfillment or execution of the finding as to losses and damages, because the plaintiff has made no effort nor urged the fulfillment and execution of that sentence; that during the time\u00a0 elapsed since said judgment became final up to this date the plaintiff has suffered no physical or mental incapacity that would hinder urging\u00a0 execution thereof or demanding the losses and damages that he alleges were caused him in 1896, and the defendant on its part has during that lapse of time made no payment on account of said losses and damages, nor has it acknowledged in writing the existence thereof or of its obligation to pay them, nor has it entered into any agreement looking toward that end.<br\/><br\/>As second special defense, lack of right of action, for during the whole time that has elapsed since said proclamations were published the plaintiff has been able freely to urge judicially before the courts and extrajudicially outside of them the collection of the revenues or rents that he believed he ought to receive as lessee, as-well as the arrears due him for previous rents, and he has made many and large collections as a result of his efforts, without let or hindrance on any occasion by the defendant in his judicial and extra-judicial efforts for collection of such arrears in rents; that in a judgment of execution secured in July, 1896, in the Court of First Instance of\u00a0 Binondo, by the defendant against the plaintiff for rents collected and not delivered to the defendant, after deduction of his commission, all the share that might pertain to the plaintiff of the rents and credits was attached and the plaintiff thereby lost whatever right he might have exercised for securing to himself said rents and credits; that in an action of ejectment instituted in the same year in the Court of First Instance of Intramuros by the defendant against the plaintiff for nonfulfillment of the conditions of said contract the court decided in favor of the defendant, ordering the ejectment of the plaintiff from the estate, a judgment rendered on January 15, 1897, and executed on April 22 next thereafter, the lessee being ejected from the estate with the consequent annulment of all his rights; that the house and furniture\u00a0 which, according to the plaintiff, were left on the estate do not have the value or price he ascribes to them, and this property never passed into possession or ownership of the\u00a0 defendant corporation but was judicially attached at the instigation of the plaintiff himself to cover his debts and in that situation it was burned in 1896 by the revolutionists without intervention or possibility of hindrance on the part of the defendant; and that the costs and expenses claimed by the plaintiff as losses and damages have arisen in various suits decided before 1899, one of which has been mentioned in the special defense and its expiration already alleged, while the rest are a large number of suits for ejectment instituted by the plaintiff against tenants of the estate, whereto the defendant corporation was not a party and wherein no judgment was rendered against it.<br\/><br\/>As third special defense, <i>res adjudicata<\/i>, for the reason that in the said suit for detainer and recovery of possession the plaintiff secured judgment for the losses and damages which he now again claims, and there is pending solely execution of the liquidation and payment of the indemnity under consideration, and that they were not liquidated and paid is due exclusively to the fact that the plaintiff did not urge the execution of that judgment he had secured and which he in fact renounced through abandonment and neglect of his rights.<br\/><br\/>As a counterclaim the defendant corporation alleges that in said judgment of execution the plaintiff was sentenced to pay it the sum of P2,386.67 and the costs, which amounted to about P500, of which sums it only received P1,389, so there remained a balance in its favor of Pl,497.67, which the plaintiff still owes and which the defendant has been unable to demand because the plaintiff left the Philippines in 1898 and did not return until two or three months ago; that in said judgment of ejectment the plaintiff was sentenced to pay to the defendant all the costs, amounting to about P1,000, nor was it possible to make demand upon him for the reason set forth; and that as the plaintiff has not complied with the terms and conditions of the said contract, mentioned in No. 4 of the special defense, he has caused the defendant losses and damages amounting to P24,000, wherefore the defendant prays that it be absolved from the foregoing complaint and that the plaintiff be sentenced to pay the sums set forth in the counterclaim, with all the costs.<br\/><br\/>In reply to the special defenses alleged by the defendant and to the counterclaim, counsel for the plaintiff denies all the facts alleged by the defendant, with the exception of what is expressly admitted in the complaint, and as a special defense against the counterclaim alleges that the rights of action, which the defendant claims to have against the plaintiff and which it exercises in its counterclaim, has prescribed, and therefore he requests that the counterclaim be dismissed and judgment rendered in accordance with the prayer in the complaint.<br\/><br\/>After due trial and examination of the evidence submitted by the parties, the court on September 19, 1912, rendered the judgment mentioned, whereto both parties excepted and asked for a new hearing.\u00a0 This motion was denied by orders of the 1st and 5th of October of last year, and each party filed his respective bill of exceptions, which was approved and forwarded to the clerk of this court.<br\/><br\/>The subject matter of the action in this suit is a demand for fulfillment of an obligation declared in a final judgment.<br\/><br\/>The defendant, who was sentenced in a judgment of the Court of First Instance under date of May 12,1896, affirmed by the Audiencia of Manila on November 14, 1898, to the payment of losses and damages and of products and rents to the plaintiff, as well as the costs, alleged as his principal exceptions to the complaint the\u00a0 lack of right of action and the fact that the action exercised by said plaintiff has now prescribed.<br\/><br\/>On the dates when those judgments, both of the Court of First Instance and of the Audiencia of Manila, were rendered, the <i>Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil<\/i> was still in force.\u00a0 In the condition of execution of the sentence, in which the course of the case for dispossession remained arrested, the provisions of articles 394-398 of that <i>Ley<\/i> were not applicable, with reference to expiration of action by abandonment of the parties in the prosecution of the trial in the part thereof relating to the execution of a final judgment.<br\/><br\/>Article 401 of said <i>Ley<\/i> provides as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"The provisions\u00a0 of the preceding articles shall not be applicable\u00a0 to the proceedings for the execution of final judgments.\u00a0 Such proceedings may be carried\u00a0 on until fulfillment of the judgment has been secured, even though it has remained arrested during the periods set forth in article 394.\"<\/blockquote>These are the periods fixed for expiration of the right of action.<br\/><br\/>It is an established fact, admitted by the parties, that the plaintiff left these Islands for Spain and that the decision of the Audiencia of Manila of November 14, 1898, was announced and read in open court for and on behalf of the then absent plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>In order that this form of notification produce effects and the absentee be considered notified, it is necessary to comply with the provisions of article 267 of said procedural law, which reads thus:<br\/><blockquote>\"The orders and judgments announced in open court and the summonses and postponements thereof\u00a0 shall also be published by edicts which must be affixed to the doorways of the courtrooms where the hearings take place, such actions also being certified in the proceedings.<br\/><br\/>\"The result of final judgments shall also be inserted in the official newspapers in the cases and in the manner the law prescribes.\u00a0 In such case a copy of the newspaper in which publication was effected shall be attached to the record.\"<\/blockquote>It does not appear in the record from any certification made by the clerk of the court that the requirement of publication by edicts and in the Official Gazette of the result of said judgment was fulfilled, in order that it might have produced its effects for the absent plaintiff so as to hold him notified in due form and to make the judgment final.<br\/><br\/>In accordance with the provisions of the <i>Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil<\/i>, which was\u00a0 still in force when the Audiencia of Manila in November, 1898, affirmed the judgment allotting losses and damages, the procedure\u00a0 indicated thereby must be followed in its execution, both for fixing the amount of the losses and damages and of the products as well as for effecting payment thereof by levy and attachment under the following articles of said <i>Ley<\/i>, which was repealed only on October 1, 1901, by Act No. 190, entitled \"Code of Civil Procedure.\"<br\/><br\/>Article 1643 of said <i>Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil<\/i> says:<br\/><blockquote>\"The amount of the losses and damages and of the products shall be fixed by the court, without further right of appeal, by the procedure provided in article 1631.<br\/><br\/>\"To make these judgments effective, after liquidation of the amount thereof, recourse\u00a0 shall be had to\u00a0 the levy and attachment established for judgments of execution.\"<\/blockquote>Article 1631, cited therein, is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"If there be judgment for products or losses and damages, the value thereof shall be determined in another hearing, wherein, from the allegations of the parties and the evidence adduced, the court will determine what should be paid.\"<\/blockquote>Thus, the judgment of the Court of First Instance, affirmed by the Audiencia of Manila, was not susceptible of fulfillment and execution for the reason that to be so it was necessary for the court through certain legal procedure to fix the amount of the products and the damages and losses set forth in the sentence, without which indispensable finding execution of said affirmed judgment by levy and attachment would be absolutely impossible.<br\/><br\/>True it is that the interested party, Montilla, did nothing from November 14, 1898, when the judgment of affirmation was rendered, until December 15, 1911, when he filed his complaint in the Court of First Instance; but neither did the defendant party responsible for said losses and damages do anything, although it remained in this city, while Montilla was away in Spain even before November 14, 1898, and up to a short time before he filed his complaint on December 15, 1911.<br\/><br\/>It does not appear that the notification in open court, which was made in his name and for him in the former court, was effected in due\u00a0 form and in accordance with the provisions of article 267 of the only code of civil procedure then in force, and consequently there is no legal reason for holding that he was notified and informed of said affirmative judgment until December 15, 1911.<br\/><br\/>In the above-quoted article 401 of the <i>Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil<\/i> it is established that proceedings for the execution of final judgments may be carried on until their fulfillment is secured, even though they may have remained arrested during the periods fixed in article 394 with reference to expiration of the action through abandonment and lack of effort, because the provisions of the preceding articles on expiration thereof are not applicable.\u00a0 It is to be noted that the three terms or periods fixed in article 394 are reckoned, according to a positive provision of the law, from the last notification, and this procedure was not effected with the plaintiff in the manner prescribed by the law, and therefore he is held not to have been notified.<br\/><br\/>Aside from the foregoing, the said judgment of execution cannot be fulfilled or executed from the date when it was rendered by the Audiencia of Manila in November, 1898, until December, 1911, because it was not communicated, nor was a certified copy of it transmitted, nor was the record returned to the Court of First Instance until the 22d of the said month of December, 1911, as a result of action by the appellant Montilla, who came to this city\u00a0 from Spain for the purpose.<br\/><br\/>The final judgment determining the obligation of the defendant to pay the amount of the losses and damages and of the products and rents to the plaintiff was only registered in the Court of First Instance on said date, December 22, 1911, and since then the plaintiff could exercise his right to demand fulfillment of the obligation, for he was unable to do so even when present in this city while the record with the final judgment was in the files of this Supreme Court.<br\/><br\/>Upon these assumptions and in order to elucidate whether the claim or action exercised by the plaintiff Montilla in order to secure payment of the amount of the products or rents and of the losses and damages, to which the defendant corporation was sentenced, has or has not prescribed, we will begin by quoting herewith the following articles of the Civil Code:<br\/><blockquote>\"ART. 1969.\u00a0 The time for the prescription of all\u00a0 kinds of actions, when there is no special provision to the contrary, shall\u00a0 be counted from the day on which they could have been instituted.\"<br\/><br\/>\"ART. 1971.\u00a0 The period for the prescription of actions to demand the fulfillment of obligations declared in a judgment shall begin from the day the judgment became final.\"<\/blockquote>In prescription of actions the only point of transcendental importance that first presents itself in proceeding to examine the character, conditions, and consequence thereof is this;\u00a0 Given the nature of the obligation in question, and since in all cases where the code makes no special provision for computing the periods for extinguishment by prescription, the above-quoted article 1969 of the Civil Code must be followed, and according to it the time for the prescription of all kinds of actions must be counted, in the absence of any special provision to the contrary, from the day on which they could have been instituted, this being a supplementary provision in the lack of a fixed rule for each case, from what moment must computation be made of the period fixed by law for regarding the potential right of action as extinguished?<br\/><br\/>In applying the provisions of that article for the resolution of a suit on appeal the supreme court has in its decision of May 8, 1903, laid down the following principle:\u00a0 \"It cannot be doubted that the corresponding action for securing rights which may be immediately asserted arises from the instant when an act is performed or any contract executed that violates those rights; and this moment must be taken for beginning to count in each case the period of the prescription, when the law does not specifically provide otherwise, for the phrase employed by the legislator in said article 1969 that prescription shall be counted from the day on which such actions could have been exercised plainly refers to the legal possibility, for which purpose the situation of the individual and other circumstances alone must be taken into account, when the law so determines and designates it as an exception, which is in accordance with the scope and purpose of the prescription.\"<br\/><br\/>In accordance with the provision contained in said article 1969 of the Civil Code and with the principle laid down by the supreme court, from what date must computation be made of the period of prescription for the right of action accruing to Agustin Montilla for seeking fulfillment of the positive sentence for damages and losses and for restitution of rents set forth in the judgment affirmed by the Audiencia of Manila on November 14, 1898?\u00a0 There is no doubt that it must be counted from the time when it could\u00a0 have been demanded.<br\/><br\/>Agustin Montilla was at that time away from the Islands and in Spain, and the record with the judgment of affirmation remained filed in the office of the clerk of this court from the date of its promulgation up to the month of December, 1911, without any effort on the part of the parties interested to have it returned to the Court of First Instance.\u00a0 Such return was only effected at Montilla's request on the 22d of the said month of December, 1911, wherefore only then did the judgment of affirmation of the Audiencia of Manila become final and liable to fulfillment and execution.\u00a0 It was not so before, for the record was on file in the office of the clerk of the Supreme Court and the principal party interested was absent.\u00a0 Although it appears from the record that Montilla was notified in open court in November, 1898, still this proceeding could produce no effect at all, because the requisites established in article 267 of the <i>Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil<\/i> had not been complied with, and it is improper to hold that such notification in open court, effected in Montilla's absence, can produce the effects of a personal notification made to him and over his signature.<br\/><br\/>For this reason, if Montilla was not informed in proper manner of the said judgment of affirmation rendered by the Audiencia of Manila and only learned of it upon arriving in this city in December, 1911, and upon seeking, on the 15th of that month, its fulfillment by demanding payment of the amount of the losses and damages and of the products received, to which the\u00a0 judgment of November 14, 1898, refers, only from that time can computation be made of the period of prescription for extinguishing his right of action to demand fulfillment of said judgment and sentence, for only since his return to this city and since he acknowledged notification of said sentence of the Audiencia of Manila could he exercise his right of action for demanding payment of said damages and products owed to him.\u00a0 He could not make his demand in due form before said month of December, because he was absent and was ignorant of the judgment of affirmation rendered in his favor, since he had not been notified in legal form, according to the only law applicable to the case in November, 1898.<br\/><br\/>The supreme court declared in the decision cited of May 8, 1903, that the phrase employed by the legislator in article 1969 of the code for the time of prescription for extinguishment of rights of action refers plainly to the legal possibility of their being exercised, and even though the principle was laid down in connection with an action for rescission, still, in view of the terms in which it is stated, it is unquestionably applicable to the other cases that may occur.<br\/><br\/>Prescription for extinguishment of the action accruing to Montilla could not run while he was ignorant of the sentence from which his right emanated, and even though after being informed thereof he could exercise his right of action, still so long as the record was in the Supreme Court and had not been returned to the Court of First Instance, to which pertained exclusively the right to fix the amount of losses and damages and of the rents that the plaintiff ought to receive, it was also impossible\u00a0 for him to institute any claim, and therefore there was no day from which he must exercise his right of action to demand fulfillment of the judgment of execution.<br\/><br\/>The obligation of the defendant corporation to pay to the plaintiff Montilla the amount of the products or rents he should have received, but did not, and of the losses and damages caused him, was determined by a judgment of the court affirmed by the Audiencia of Manila on November 14, 1898, and consequently the time for prescription of the right of action begins to run after the judgment became final, according to the provisions of the above-quoted article 1971 of the code, and the sentence of the Audiencia de Manila became final in December, 1911, and not after the notification in open court effected because of the absence of the plaintiff Montilla, for the reason that said notification was not effected in accordance with the law and was a deficient and ineffective proceeding, as has been demonstrated.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the Audiencia of Manila acquired a final character\u00a0 and the force of <i>res adjudicata<\/i> after the record was returned with a copy of that superior resolution to the Court of First Instance, with knowledge of the parties and especially of the absent Montilla, who procured its return.\u00a0 Since then the judgment of such higher court has become final and enforceable, and the time for prescription began to run for requiring fulfillment of the obligation therein declared, for up to that time the sentence could produce no effect, as it was not yet final; and for this reason it cannot be the basis and starting-point for prescription of the action that can be exercised until the time has come for requiring fulfillment of the obligation determined in the judgment, according to the above-quoted article 1971, which is perfectly in accord with the general rule laid down in the foregoing article 1969 of the Civil Code.<br\/><br\/>The provisions of the Civil Code, and not of the Code of Civil Procedure, have been held applicable to this case, because it is a suit instituted and terminated under the old <i>Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil<\/i>, the present litigation having sprung from a claim made for fulfillment and execution of the judgment rendered in that suit for recovery of possession.<br\/><br\/>Section 38 of Act No. 190, entitled \"Code of Civil Procedure,\" says:\u00a0 \"This chapter (III) shall not apply to actions already commenced.\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\"<br\/><br\/>Said suit having been commenced and terminated under the rules laid\u00a0 down by the former <i>Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil<\/i>, the new procedural law cannot be applied thereto with retroactive effect; and even though the said Code of Civil Procedure went into effect on October 1, 1901, still it must be kept in mind that the decision affirming the judgment rendered in said suit did not become final until the plaintiff Montilla had been duly notified and the record with the decision had been returned to the Court of First Instance on December 22, 1911, since which date alone could its fulfillment and execution be demanded and the time for prescription of the corresponding action be computed.<br\/><br\/>An action that has for its object restitution of rents improperly received and indemnity for damages and losses declared in a final judgment partakes of the nature of a personal action, and as such prescribes by the lapse of fifteen<br\/><br\/>years counted from the day when said judgment acquired a final character and the force of <i>res adjudicata<\/i>, through due notification to the parties litigant.\u00a0 (Article 1964, in connection with articles 1969 and 1971, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>Even granting the force and effect of the notification of the said judgment of the Audiencia, effected in open court for and on behalf of the then absent Montilla on November 17, 1898, and regarding it as final since the 18th day of that month, and holding Montilla to be entitled since then to seek its fulfillment and execution, it is certain that when he presented his complaint or claim therefor on December 16, 1911, only thirteen years and twenty-seven days had elapsed, counting from November 18, 1898.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, even admitting that it was possible for Montilla to present his claim after November 18, 1898, despite the fact that said judgment of the Audiencia was not yet final, because he had not been notified in open court in accordance with the law, then in doing so on December 16, 1911, he exercised his right of action within the fifteen years fixed in said article 1964 of the Civil Code, and therefore the right of action\u00a0 exercised had not yet prescribed or expired through lapse of time.<br\/><br\/>Although it is impossible to decide exactly from the advances Montilla made in Spain to Padres Jose Lobo and Jose R. Cabeza, for the purpose of getting his claims attended to by those members of the Augustinian Corporation, that said Montilla admitted knowledge of the Audiencia's judgment of affirmation after 1902, when he began to make those advances, and even supposing that he might thus be held to have been notified of that judgment, still it cannot be denied that his claim or complaint was presented within the period of fifteen years and that the right of action he exercised on December 16, 1911, had not yet prescribed.<br\/><br\/>From the foregoing it appears that there was ground for action and that the plaintiff was entitled to demand fulfillment of the obligations declared in the said judgment rendered in the suit for dispossession and affirmed by the Audiencia of Manila.<br\/><br\/>In order to determine the amount of the annual rent which the defendant corporation received and the portion thereof that the plaintiff left uncollected, it becomes proper to state that, according to the evidence taken in the case, the rent which the tenants ought to have paid for the year 1895 amounts to 9,975.90 pesos, under contracts executed with said tenants.\u00a0 If the defendant corporation received 5,000 pesos of the rent of the Pasay estate for said year 1895, as proven in the case, the plaintiff failed to collect on account of rent for that year the sum of 4,975.90 pesos; which sum said plaintiff was unable to collect as a consequence of the dispossession and molestation he suffered through the defendant's fault.<br\/><br\/>Nor does it appear that the lessee Montilla received an equal amount remaining from the total revenue of the estate for the year 1896, collectible only at the beginning of or during the first quarter of the year 1897, after deduction of the 5,000 pesos, which, according to the lease, the plaintiff-lessee ought to have covered into the treasury of the lessor corporation, for by virtue of an order issued in the summary action prosecuted by said corporation the revenues or rents\u00a0 the lessee should have received from the tenants on the estate were attached and their collection thus prohibited; and while his restitution to possession of the leased estate in the latter part of May, 1896, was ordered by the judgment of the court, his unquestionable right as lessee being thus acknowledged, still, all the proceedings of notification to the tenants of the estate were not terminated until September of the next year, 1897, and he had been unable to collect the rents for the year 1896 during the said first quarter of 1897 because they were under attachment and affected by that summary action.\u00a0 It is to be noted that the action of ejectment instituted by the corporation\u00a0 against Montilla in August, 1896, was not decided until January 15, 1897, and he was not ejected from the estate until April 22, 1897.<br\/><br\/>It has been demonstrated by conclusive proof that the defendant corporation collected important sums paid by tenants of the estate for the year 1895 and it is just that of the\u00a0 amount so collected the lessee be paid the part due him, after deduction of the sum of 5,000 pesos, which belonged to the lessor corporation under the contract executed between the parties.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the revenues or rents for the year 1896, collectible only from January to March, 1897, even though the lessee Montilla could not get them\u00a0 because of judicial intervention and the attachment levied\u00a0 upon\u00a0 them at the instance\u00a0 of the complaining lessor, notwithstanding the right accruing to the plaintiff Montilla to receive said rents, still it is improper to make any determination in this litigation, but in\u00a0 another suit, or in the summary action wherein they were attached and wherein the interested party may present the proper claims for their collection, after removal of the attachment levied upon them.<br\/><br\/>The claimant is also entitled to collect as costs and expenses of the suit the sum of 290 pesos, acknowledged by the defendant's counsel.\u00a0 As for the losses and damages caused the plaintiff by said ejectment, the finding of the court is accepted to the effect that such losses and damages were especially caused by his having been hindered in collecting not only the usual rents but also the arrears contracted during the period of the lease in the months when he was deprived of the leasehood until his authority was revoked and he was removed from the property.<br\/><br\/>Taking all together the amount of the rents not received by Montilla and of the losses and damages caused him, in accordance with the declaration in the judgment of the court, affirmed by the Audiencia, with costs, it appears to reach the sum of 8,765 pesos,\u00a0 and this the plaintiff is entitled to receive from the defendant.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the right alleged by Montilla to collect the whole amount of\u00a0 the arrears from tenants during the period of the lease, which he estimates at 4,000\u00a0 pesos, a right not impugned or denied by the lessor, it has not been satisfactorily proven what was the number of debtor tenants and the sums owed from 1891 to 1894, for if the sums the tenants failed to pay as rents for those four years must be discounted from the respective amounts said tenants were under obligation to pay yearly to the lessee, it still does not appear what were the amounts in which the annual rent fixed in the contract was reduced.\u00a0 The only definite fact resulting from\u00a0 the proceedings is that it was impossible for Montilla to collect them because of the ejectment described, whereby he undoubtedly suffered damage.\u00a0 As for the sum of 5,000 pesos for the year 1895, it appears from the record that said corporation received it entire, wherefore the plaintiff is to be credited\u00a0 with the remainder of the total rent, which amounts to 4,975 pesos and 90 <i>centimos<\/i>, a sum not received by said plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>In the case of the commission for collection of the arrears previous to the time of the lease, a double question with contrary claims has been raised by the parties.\u00a0 Plaintiff claims that the defendant corporation must pay him the sum of 6,892.70 pesos, as the commission of 50 per cent due him and not received, because he was unable to collect such arrears at the time of the leasehold on account of illegal acts of the defendant.\u00a0 The latter in turn asks as a counter-claim that the plaintiff be sentenced to pay the sum of 24,000 pesos, because he did\u00a0 not fulfill the terms and conditions of the contract whereby the plaintiff obligated himself\u00a0 to attempt the collection of said arrears unpaid by the tenants of the estate before the execution of the lease, having caused the defendant losses and damages amounting to 24,000 pesos.\u00a0 Defendant could not at the proper time file claim for this, because the plaintiff left these Islands and did not return to them until a little while before he presented his claim for losses and damages.<br\/><br\/>After the latter part of the month of February, 1896, the collector Montilla could not have succeeded in collecting any amount of the arrears from the tenants on the Pasay estate, not only on account of the molestation and dispossession to which he was subjected in that month, but also because of the natural difficulties he necessarily encountered in collecting1 old debts, for the payment whereof there was no fixed time or the prospect of a suit for ejectment, for such very old debts are different from\u00a0 the ordinary annual revenues or rents which the tenants must pay at stated periods under an obligation whose performance is guaranteed by a suit for ejectment with the payment of\u00a0 the consequent costs and expenses of an action in the courts, while the collection of arrears would have to be made from debtors who, when not insolvent, were rather stubborn in making payment.\u00a0 For these reasons it is improper and unjust to declare that the plaintiff is entitled to receive a commission at the rate of 50 per cent for collecting the sum of 25,000 pesos, which he asserts the sum total of the arrears reaches, because it is unlikely and improbable that from February to September of 1896 he could have collected all that amount.<br\/><br\/>The defendant corporation in its turn claims an indemnity for losses and damages, fixed at 24,000 pesos, for abandonment on the part of Montilla of his\u00a0 obligation to collect those arrears.\u00a0 If on the one hand the defendant saw fit expressly to revoke the authority it had conferred upon the plaintiff, according to an instrument of August 7, 1896, and on the other hand to file a suit on the 21st of the same month for ejectment of the plaintiff, who was charged with the collection of said arrears until he was removed from the estate on April 22, 1897, and also at its instance in a summary action the property and revenues the lessee Montilla was to have received from the tenants on the estate were attached, a proceeding effected on September 30, 1896, there can be no doubt that by all these proceedings the plaintiff was left in the situation of being unable to fulfill his agreement after February, 1896, when he was disturbed and removed from possession and enjoyment of the lease of the estate and of the right to collect the arrears and ordinary rents the tenants owed.<br\/><br\/>If it is wholly impossible to accept the plaintiff's theory that he was hindered from making collection of either of these revenues through illegal acts of the defendant after February, 1896, and thus is entitled to the commission which he ought to have received\u00a0 on collecting all the arrears in question, the defendant's theory is also inadmissible in law that as the plaintiff had abandoned his attempts at collection he owed it 24,000 pesos\u00a0 as losses and damages, because the collector could not discharge his duty for the reasons stated.\u00a0 Both claims are improper and illegal.<br\/><br\/>Furthermore, it appears that the action instituted by the defendant in counterclaim for the payment of said 24,000 pesos against the plaintiff for the reasons above set forth, prescribed on February 10, 1912, for when the authority the defendant corporation conferred on Montilla on August 7, 1896, was revoked on the\u00a0 next day, the 8th of the same month, or at the very latest the 22d of the same month wherein the suit for ejectment was filed against Montilla, said corporation could and ought to have instituted the corresponding action claiming payment of the said sum of 24,000 pesos which it claims as indemnity for losses and damages caused by abandonment on Montilla's part of the obligation to collect arrears from the tenants of the estate.<br\/><br\/>So, to claim that indemnity, recourse has been had for the first time through a counterclaim to a personal action emanating from an agreement or contract in writing, which is clearly subject to the Code of Civil Procedure in force since October 1, 1901; nor can article 1964 of the Civil Code be invoked, since it is not a question of an action exercised in a suit already commenced before the promulgation of that code of procedure.'\u00a0 The counterclaim was\u00a0 only filed on February 10, 1912, when the right of action for claiming such indemnity had already expired on October 2, 1911, according to the provisions of section 43, No. 1, in\u00a0 connection with section 38 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as the period of ten years had elapsed from the promulgation of that code on October 1, 1901.<br\/><br\/>It is likewise demanded in a counterclaim that the plaintiff be sentenced to payment of the sum of a thousand pesos, the approximate amount of all the costs of the suit for ejectment.\u00a0 The defendant corporation instituted this suit against Montilla on August 21, 1896, for violation of the lease in the part referring to the gradual increase of the bond for guaranteeing: it, and this suit was finally decided on January 15, 1897, and he was ejected from the property on April 22 of the same year.<br\/><br\/>From January 16, 1897, to February 10, 1912, when the counterclaim was presented for said sum\u00a0 of a thousand pesos, the period of fifteen years, within which the right of action to demand it could and ought to have been exercised, had more than elapsed.\u00a0 This right of action is of a personal nature and prescribed in accordance with article 1964 of the code, when the judgment became final on January 15, 1897, according to the provisions of article 1971 of that code, which says:\u00a0 \"The\u00a0 period for the prescription of actions to demand the fulfillment of obligations declared in a judgment shall begin from the day the judgment became final.\"<br\/><br\/>It is, therefore, for the causes and reasons set forth, improper in law to sentence Montilla under a counterclaim for payment of the sums of 24,000 and 1,000 pesos, claimed respectively by the defendant in its second and\u00a0 third grounds of action exercised therein.<br\/><br\/>The correctness or incorrectness of the attachment of the house and furniture of the plaintiff as a result of the suit for ejectment, judgment wherein became final, cannot be discussed in this litigation.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the first cause of action relating to the amount which, as principal, interest, and costs, Agustin Montilla has been sentenced in a final judgment rendered in the summary action instituted\u00a0 by the Augustinian Corporation, it must be stated here that on February 10, 1912, when the right of\u00a0 action was exercised through a counter-claim for payment of the sums the defeated Montilla owed to the winning party, said right of action had not yet prescribed, for final judgment was rendered on November 23, 1896, and affirmed on October 4, 1897, by a judgment rendered by the Audiencia of Manila, in virtue of an appeal raised by the defeated Montilla.\u00a0 Wherefore, in accordance with articles 1969 and 1971 of the Civil Code the right of action exercised in a counterclaim by the winning defendant could have been exercised from February 5,1897, and it was done on February 10, 1912, when only fourteen years four months and four days had elapsed, and therefore the said counterclaim based on the first of the causes of action alleged in its reply was filed in time and within the period of fifteen years fixed by article 1964 of the Civil Code.<br\/><br\/>In the final judgment dated November 23, 1896, rendered in the executory actions instituted by the Augustinians against Montilla, exhibited at the hearing in this case, execution was ordered to proceed for the sum of 2,386 pesos 67 <i>centimos<\/i> and 3 <i>octavos<\/i>, and legal interest at 6 per cent a\u00a0 year from May 16, 1894 (pp. 154 to\u00a0 170).\u00a0 On page 182 of the orders of execution there is certified a note for the sum of 1,389 pesos, placed in the safe on November 4, 1895, which would have\u00a0 fallen due on the same day and month in 1896.\u00a0 This sum was deposited voluntarily in coin with interest at 5 per cent a year and was indorsed to the order of the procurator of the convent of the Augustinian Order on August 13, 1896.<br\/><br\/>By order of July 28, 1898, at the petition of the\u00a0 winning party, the attachment granted therein on the sum of 1,389 pesos, entered in said note with interest due, was extended (p. 204 of said orders).<br\/><br\/>At the petition of the same winning party, by order of December 26,1898, the sum of 1,389 pesos with interest due on the capital stated in said note, attached as a result of the said summary action in payment of a part of the debt that was the subject matter of the suit, was adjudicated to the Augustinian Order (p. 212).<br\/><br\/>For the purpose of determining exactly the amount of the counterclaim based on said first cause of action, an amount owed by the defeated Mbntilla, it is indispensable to show the responsibility alleged, as follows:<br\/><blockquote><table border=\"0\" width=\"100%\"> <tbody><tr valign=\"top\"> <td width=\"85%\">Principal subject to execution...........................<\/td> <td width=\"15%\"><div align=\"right\">P2,886.67<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>Interest at 6 per cent from May 16, 1894, to December 26, 1898 ....................................<\/td> <td><div

....................................................<\/td> <td><div align=\"right\">3,046.98<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <\/tbody><\/table> <\/blockquote>Computation of interest at 6 per cent on the principal due is made up to December 26, 1898, for the reason that on such date the value of the note, P1,389, was adjudicated to the prevailing creditor.<br\/><br\/>In adjudicating this sum with interest thereon to the Augustinian Corporation no statement was made of the amount of interest at 5 per cent that had been duly computed, under the fifteenth section of the lease, that is, whether in the annual renewal of the deposit the interest due for each year would be added to the principal and compounded interest, which was to be placed or again deposited in the general treasury.<br\/><br\/>So, after computation of the interest accrued at the rate of 5 per cent a year on the principal represented by said note for 1,389 pesos Mexican, from November 4, 1895, to December 26,1898\u2014that is, three years one month and nineteen\u00a0 days\u2014with interest compounded each year, according to agreement, it appears that said principal produced P229,84 7\/8; wherefore the computation of the principal stated in said note and interest thereon gives a total sum of 1,618 pesos 84 <i>centimos<\/i> and 7 <i>octavos<\/i>, in payment of 3,046 pesos and 98 <i>centimos<\/i>, the amount of the debt and interest that were the subject matter of that summary action.<br\/><br\/>This latter sum of 3,046 pesos and 98 <i>centimos<\/i> of debt was partly covered by the 1,618 pesos 84 <i>centimos<\/i> and 7 <i>octavos<\/i> of principal and interest in said note, so there still remained as debt the balance of 1,428 pesos 13 <i>centimos<\/i> and 1 <i>octavo<\/i>, which appears to have been more than paid by the sum of 3,881 pesos and 52 <i>centimos<\/i> collected by the depositary as rents for the year 1896, in the months of June, September, and December, 1897, and May, 1898, which all admit was the result of the summary action, without express statement of the amount of the costs, because they were not duly computed and assessed.<br\/><br\/>Article 1196 of the Civil Code prescribes:<br\/><blockquote>\"In order that compensation may be proper, it is required:<br\/><br\/>\"1. That each of the persons bound shall be so principally, and that he be at the same time the principal creditor of the other.<br\/><br\/>\"2.

That both debts be due.<br\/><br\/>\"4. That\u00a0 they be determined and determinable.\"<\/blockquote>Having thus demonstrated in a conclusive manner that the whole debt of the summary action and of the counter-claim, based on the first cause of action, was more than paid in 1898, even before the adjudication of the amount in said note and the interest due thereon, for of the amount collected as rents and attached in 1898 the sum of 2,453 pesos and 38 <i>centimos<\/i> and 7 <i>octavos<\/i> still remained, it is improper to oblige the losing party to pay the same or to declare \"compensation\" [offset] therefor proper, because no debt exists on the part of the loser Montilla that can\u00a0 be \"compensated\" by the sum owed and due him from the defendant corporation.<br\/><br\/>With\u00a0 respect to interest on the sum of 8,765 pesos declared in plaintiff's favor, in our opinion payment only of legal interest at 6 per cent is proper, from the date of the judgment appealed from on September 19, 1912, because it is not a question of a sum computed and owed by virtue of a sentence rendered in the suit for recovery, for if the same\u00a0 had been executed in accordance with the former <i>Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil<\/i> it would have been necessary to take evidence on the importance and amount of the rents and of the losses and damages caused and it would have been necessary to render a final decision, the court fixing, without further right of appeal, the definite sums that the party sentenced must pay.\u00a0 (Articles 1631 and 1643, <i>Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil<\/i>.)<br\/><br\/>What was not then done, was done in the judgment on appeal fixing the amounts for which the defendant was responsible, for until they are computed and so declared in a final judgment, the defendant cannot be regarded\u00a0 as delinquent in the fulfillment of his obligation to pay the debt with interest.\u00a0 (Decisions of November 19, 1869; February 27, 1901; and July 13, 1904; rendered by the supreme court of Spain on appeal with reference to the construction and application of article 1108 of the civil code of that country, almost identical with the one in force in these Islands.)<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, whereby the errors assigned by both parties to the judgment appealed from are deemed refuted, and affirming that judgment in 30 far as it is in accord herewith, the defendant corporation is sentenced to pay to the plaintiff Montilla the sum of P8,765, with legal interest at 6 per cent a year from September 19, 1912, the date of the judgment of the court, and\u00a0 the costs, without prejudice to the plaintiff's right to claim from defendant the portion of rents for the year 1896 that belong to him and were attached at the latter's request in said summary action.\u00a0 Said plaintiff is absolved from the\u00a0 counterclaim filed by defendant on the second and third grounds of action; and it is declared to be improper to decree in this judgment \"compensation\" [offset] for the sums the plaintiff Montilla is alleged to owe the defendant Augustinian Corporation, and that which the latter must make to him under this decision, for the reason that, as stated above, it has already been\u00a0 paid, the counterclaim\u00a0 being thus dismissed on the first ground of action.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Mapa<\/i> and <i>Johnson, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><i>Carson, J<\/i>., concurs in the result. <i><br\/>Moreland<\/i> and <i>Trent, JJ<\/i>., dissent. <\/div>",

TOMAS SUNICO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE,<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TRENT, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">This is an action to set a sheriff's sale of three parcels of land which had been mortgaged by the appelant, Valeriana Raymundo, to the appellee and bought in by the appellee at the public sale was irregularly confirmed by the court.\u00a0 The defendant's demurrer was sustained ad the action dismissed upon the ground that the allegations in the complaint do not constitute a cause of action.\u00a0 From this judgment the plaintiffs appealed.<br\/><br\/>The demurrer admits all of the allegations in the complaint which are well pleaded.\u00a0 The facts as alleged in the complaint are these: Valeriana Raymundo was the owner of three parcels of land situated in the municipality of Bay, Province of Laguna.\u00a0 She mortgaged this land to a company or society known as \"Chuidian, Buenaventura y Compa\u00f1ia\" to secure the payment of P5,915.56.\u00a0 On April 6, 1908, an action was commenced to foreclose this mortgage.\u00a0 On November 20 of that year a judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiff in that action for the amount of the mortgage together with interest and costs, and an order was entered directing the defendants (plaintiffs here) to pay the amount of that judgment within the time prescribed by law and in case of their failure to do so, directed that the property be sold in accordance with the provisions\u00a0 of sections 256 and 457 of Act No. 190.\u00a0 An appeal was taken to the Supreme Court where the judgment was affirmed and the\u00a0 record returned to the court below on January 9,1911.<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> On February 3 of that year the court issued an order in which it directed that the three parcels of land be sold to satisfy the judgment.\u00a0 In compliance with this order the sheriff sold the land at public auction on March 24, 1911, to the mortgagee for the sum of P7,468.48, being the total amount then due.\u00a0 On June 5, 1011, the sale was approved by the court without any notice whatever to the plaintiffs in this action.\u00a0 The plaintiffs remained entirely ignorant of the confirmation of the sale by the court until July 5, 1911, when Valeriana offered to pay the defendant the entire amount of the judgment against her with interest and costs, which offer was refused.\u00a0 Thereupon this action was instituted to set aside the sale.<br\/><br\/>The question whether or not a mortgagor is entitled as a matter of right to notice of the hearing for the approval of the sheriff's sale is directly raised, or, in other words, if the sale of mortgaged property is approved without giving the mortgagor an opportunity to be heard, is such approval valid and sufficient to pass title?<br\/><br\/>Section 257 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"When the defendant, after being directed to do so, as provided in the last preceding section, failed to pay the principal, interest and costs at the time directed in the order, the court shall order the property to be sold in the manner and under the regulations that govern sales of real estate under execution; but such sale shall not affect the rights of persons holding prior incumbrances upon the same estate, or a part thereof.\u00a0 The sale, <i>when confirmed by decree of the court, shall operate to divest the rights of all the parties to the action, and to vest their rights in the purchaser<\/i>.\u00a0 Should the court decline to confirm the sale, for good cause shown, and should set it aside, it shall order a resale in accordance with law.\"<\/blockquote>That no title passes under a\u00a0 sheriff's sale of mortgaged real property until the sale is confirmed by the court having jurisdiction, appears to be clear from the reading of the above section.\u00a0 Jones, in his treatise on mortgages, section 1637, says: \"Until confirmed by the court the sale is incomplete.\u00a0 The acceptance of the bid confers no title upon the purchaser, and not even any absolute right, to have the purchase completed.\u00a0 He is nothing more than a preferred bidder, or proposer for the purchase, subject to the sanction of the court afterwards.\"<br\/><br\/>As the title to mortgaged real property does not vest in the purchaser until after the confirmation of the sale, he has, prior to that time, no right to the possession of such property, and no legal cause of complaint against the defendants, who remain in possession, exercising the rights of ownership.\u00a0 On the other hand, the mortgagors have no means, until after the confirmation, of compelling the purchaser to comply with the terms of the sale.\u00a0 Should the mortgagors attempt to compel a purchaser to pay in his money an answer on the part of the purchaser to the effect that the sale had not been confirmed would be sufficient.\u00a0 The confirmation operates to divest the title out of the former owner and to vest it in the purchaser.\u00a0 It is at this time when the rights or title passes, and not before.\u00a0 Sales of mortgaged real estate should be more strictly scrutinized than ordinary sales under execution.\u00a0 In the former the title, as we have said, passes to the purchaser upon confirmation by the court, and the defendant or debtor has no right to redeem within the statutory period granted in cases of ordinary execution sales.\u00a0 In some of the States of the American Union there are statutes permitting the mortgagor to redeem after the foreclosure sale, has been confirmed.\u00a0 There is no such privilege extended to him by statute in the Philippine Islands.\u00a0 The right of the mortgagor and those claiming under him to redeem from the mortgage is extinguished by the foreclosure when the same has been properly made.\u00a0 But, up to the time of confirmation the title remains in the mortgagor.<br\/><br\/>The last part of section 257, <i>supra<\/i>, reads: \"Should the court decline to confirm the sale, <i>for good cause shown<\/i>, and should set it aside, it shall order a resale in accordance with law.\"<br\/><br\/>This part of the section clearly shows that there must be a hearing for the confirmation of the sale.\u00a0 If there is no hearing the parties would have no\u00a0 opportunity to show that the sale should be set aside.\u00a0 The court cannot set aside the sale except for good cause which must be shown.\u00a0 This good cause cannot be shown unless the interested parties be given an opportunity, and they cannot be given an opportunity unless a hearing is had upon the question whether or not the sale should be confirmed.\u00a0 It is quite true that it is not required that this hearing shall be a separate\u00a0 action.\u00a0 It is a part of the foreclosure proceedings.\u00a0 It is a very essential part of those proceedings because the hearing gives the interested parties an opportunity to lay before the court their reasons why the sale should or should not be confirmed, and it is the result of this hearing which divests the title if the sale is confirmed.\u00a0 That the hearing for the confirmation of the sale must be upon motion and all parties interested be notified, including the plaintiff, defendant, and the purchaser at the sale, in order that they may show cause, if there is any, why the sale should not be confirmed, appears, we think, very clear from the reading of section 257, <i>supra<\/i>, and the nature and character of the sale and the results which flow from the confirmation.<br\/><br\/>Valeriana Raymundo was not only a party to the foreclosure proceedings, but she was the party most interested in the confirmation of the sale.\u00a0 She was the owner of the land and remains owner until the sale is regularly confirmed.\u00a0 She loses all of her right, title, and interest in the property upon the confirmation, but not before.\u00a0 If the property had been sold under an ordinary execution she would not have been so vitally interested because she would have had one year from the sale in which to redeem the property, but in this action she could not redeem after the sale had been regularly confirmed.\u00a0 To deprive her of her property by confirming the sale without giving her an opportunity to be heard would be contrary to the plain principles of justice.\u00a0 She may have good reasons why the sale should not have been confirmed; such as irregularities in the conduct of the sale, misconduct on the part of the sheriff or any of the parties, misrepresentations, etc., but whatever\u00a0 may be her reasons, and however well founded they may be, she has been given no opportunity to present them to the court.\u00a0 She must certainly be given this opportunity before it can be held that she has lost all her interest in the property by virtue of the foreclosure proceedings.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons we are of the opinion that the allegations in the amended complaint state a cause of action.\u00a0 The orders appealed from are therefore reversed\u00a0 and the case will be returned to the court below with instructions to require the defendant to answer.\u00a0 The case will then proceed to final determination.\u00a0 Without costs in this instance.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

The 5th day of June, 1911, said sale was approved by this court without notice of any\u00a0 kind to the plaintiff who was and remained in complete ignorance of said confirmation until the_____day of July, 1911, when, believing that she had a perfect right to do so, she offered to pay and satisfy completely the mortgage debt and the judgment based thereon, together with costs and\u00a0 interest; that the said defendant refused to accept it, at the same time informing the plaintiff of the fact that the sale had been confirmed by the court.<br\/><br\/>\"8. The provincial sheriff of Laguna, in conformity with the said order of confirmation, upon a date unknown to this plaintiff, executed\u00a0 in favor of the defendant a\u00a0 conveyance transferring the absolute property in said lands.<br\/><br\/>\"9. The lands in question are worth P15,000 and in the said foreclosure sale were sold for less than half their value, to the great injury of the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>\"10. That, if the plaintiff had been informed of the intention of the court to confirm the sale, she would have satisfied the mortgage debt completely, with costs and interest, and would thereby have obtained the\u00a0 disapprobation instead of the confirmation of said sale.<br\/><br\/>\"11. For these reasons the sale of the said premises to the defendant is null and the plaintiff has the right to redeem them, paying the judgment with costs and interest, leaving the lands in question free from lien of said mortgage.<br\/><br\/>\"12. That the amount of said judgment, with interest and costs to date, is seven thousand six hundred and seventy pesos and forty seven centavos (P7,670.47), which sum this plaintiff offers to pay to the defendant to redeem said lands, and for that purpose deposits the same with the clerk of this court subject to the disposition of the defendant, the plaintiff at the\u00a0 same time\u00a0 offering to pay any other sum which the court regards equitable and just for the redemption of said property in question.<br\/><br\/>\"<i>Wherefore<\/i>, the plaintiff prays that, after service of process upon the defendant, the court dictate a judgment anulling the sale and permitting the plaintiff to redeem the land in question from the lien of said mortgage, together with any other remedy which is just and equitable, together with costs.\"<\/blockquote>The prevailing opinion says that \"this is an action to set aside a sheriff's sale of three parcels of land, which had been mortgaged by the appellant, Valeriana Raymundo, to the appellee and bought in by the appellee at the public sale, on the ground that the sale was irregularly confirmed by the court;\" and \"the plaintiff remained entirely ignorant of the confirmation of the sale by the court until July 5,1911, when Valeriana offered to pay the defendant the entire amount of the judgment against her with interest and costs, which offer was refused.\u00a0 Thereupon this action was instituted <i>to set aside the sale.<\/i>\"<br\/><br\/>If these statements of the nature of the action are correct,they in themselves demonstrate, to my mind, the correctness of the judgment of the court below.<br\/><br\/>First, as to the correctness of these statements.<br\/><br\/>Upon the whole case as it is presented to this court it would appear, upon ordinary principles, that the statement is substantially correct.\u00a0 While, in my opinion, under the allegations of the complaint and the prayer for relief, the action is intended in legal effect to be one to redeem, the setting aside of the sale being merely\u00a0 an incident thereto, it would be, generally speaking and under all the circumstances, but natural for the court to feel itself bound by the construction put upon the complaint and, consequently, the nature of the action, by the plaintiff herself both here and in the court below.\u00a0 The opening paragraph of appellant's brief reads as follows:\u00a0 \"This is an action to set aside a sheriff's sale of three parcels of land which have\u00a0 been mortgaged by appellant to appellee and bought in by the appellee (who was also the mortgagee) at the public sale, on the ground that the sale was irregularly confirmed by the court\u00a0 and appellant has been deprived of her property without due process of law.\"\u00a0 One of the errors assigned is that, \"the lower court erred in not holding that the sheriff's sale in question should have been set aside, inasmuch as the sale had been confirmed <i>ex parte<\/i> without notifying appellant of the hearing to confirm the same.\"\u00a0 The argument of counsel throughout the brief confirms, in the strongest way, this theory of the action.\u00a0 There is nothing therein which in any way establishes or tends to establish the theory that the action is one to redeem, but, on the contrary, every line of the brief tends to support the position taken by the majority of the court when it holds that the action is one to set aside a sale, said\u00a0 action being based upon the sole ground that plaintiff was not notified of the hearing on the motion to confirm.<br\/><br\/>While there is an allegation in the complaint upon which there might possibly have been based, originally, the claim that the sale was irregular for the reason that the decree of foreclosure was made during the same term of court at which the judgment of the Supreme Court affirming the judgment declaring the amount due and ordering the same paid was received, whereas, under section 256 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as construed by a recent decision of this court, the decree of foreclosure and sale should not have been made until the \"first day of the next term of the court immediately succeeding the one at which\" the judgment of the court was returned; and while this objection seems to have been presented to and argued in the court below upon the hearing\u00a0 of the demurrer, inasmuch as that court, in its decision sustaining the demurrer, refers to that objection and discusses it at some length, nevertheless, this objection seems to have been abandoned in this court, as no error is assigned in regard to it, no mention is made of it anywhere in the brief, and there has been no argument in any wise touching it.\u00a0 Moreover, the manner in which this objection, if it be one, is set out in the complaint gives every evidence that it was not intended to be relied upon as an objection, the facts relating to it being given in a narrative form and for the apparent purpose merely of giving a connected history of the case.\u00a0 It is not, as a matter of pleading, put in the form of an objection and there are lacking the other allegations which should have accompanied it if the pleader had intended to make it one of the bases of his cause of action.<br\/><br\/>For the reason stated one might naturally feel constrained to accept this theory of the case in spite of the inconsistency involved in the idea that <i>sale<\/i> may be set aside for errors of procedure in the <i>confirmation<\/i> and even though, for that reason, the bare statement of the theory demonstrates, of necessity, that the complaint states no cause of action whatever and that the action is unsustainable.<br\/><br\/>The difficulty I meet, however, in considering the case from the view taken of it by the court is the impossibility, as I view it, of dicussing it logically and rationally.\u00a0 How is one to discuss the proposition that a sale in foreclosure should be set aside for causes that have not the remotest connection with the validity or regularity of the sale?\u00a0 Is the thesis that a sale should be set aside for the sole reason that a party did not get notice of the hearing on its confirmation discussable at all?\u00a0 How can we logically and rationally deal with a case when we start out with, to my mind, an impossible assumption, with a theory the elements of which are contradictory?\u00a0 And upon what principles shall we proceed when we begin with the hypothesis that one thing is the cause of another when the two things, the cause and the effect, bear no legal or rational relation to each other?\u00a0 Under such circumstances the complaint should be dismissed out of hand.\u00a0 No discussion, it seems to me, is necessary to demonstrate that an action to set aside a sale in foreclosure upon the sole ground that the plaintiff had no notice of the confirmation is\u00a0 inherently and necessarily unsustainable.\u00a0 However, in view of all the circumstances, I shall present my views on the various phases of the case as presented by the appellant and the court.<br\/><br\/>Second, as to the impossibility of maintaining the action.<br\/><br\/>(1) This is not the proper remedy.<br\/><br\/>The proceeding should have been by motion.<br\/><br\/>It should be noted that, according to the allegations of the complaint,\u00a0 as construed by the plaintiff herself, the action is not one to set aside the sale for fraud, misconduct or irregularity\u00a0 in the\u00a0 sale\u00a0 itself.\u00a0 The alleged\u00a0 irregularity, namely, failure of notice, relates solely to the <i>confirmation<\/i> of the sale.\u00a0 The complaint, therefore, shows upon its face that there is no reason for setting aside the sale.\u00a0 It is conceded, of course, that an action or motion to set aside a sale must be based upon irregularity, fraud or misconduct <i>in the sale itself<\/i>.\u00a0 The only purpose for which an order confirming the sale can be vacated is to give the party an opportunity to be present at the hearing on the motion to confirm and to take such action in opposition thereto as seems advisable.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, the fact\u00a0 that plaintiff's action is based solely upon the failure of notice of the hearing on the action to confirm is a concession\u00a0 that the action cannot be one\u00a0 to set aside the sale, or that, if it was intended to be such an action, it cannot in any manner be maintained.\u00a0 The only purpose in attacking the confirmation is to get rid of it in order that the moving party may ultimately attack the sale itself.\u00a0 The sole purpose of the plaintiff, in spite of her reiterated desire to set aside the sale and\u00a0 her insistence in the presentation to this court of that question alone, is to set aside the order of confirmation.\u00a0 This is clearly demonstrated by the allegations of the complaint itself, they clearly disclosing that there is absolutely no reason to set aside the sale itself.<br\/><br\/>This being the case, it is clear that the plaintiff has mistaken her remedy.\u00a0 An attempt to set aside an order of confirmation by action is an attempt to create a procedure heretofore unheard of.\u00a0\u00a0 The failure of the plaintiff to be present at the hearing, even though through no fault of her town, partakes of the nature of a default; and a proceeding to obtain the opportunity of being present is governed very largely by the rules\u00a0 applicable to defaults.\u00a0 The moving party must show not only that there was no\u00a0 notice but also that she was prejudiced by the fact that she was not heard.\u00a0 These matters are always presented to the court by motion, and whether or not the order is set aside and the moving party heard rests in the sound discretion of the\u00a0 court.\u00a0 It is a proceeding in the foreclosure action and not independent thereof.\u00a0 It is a quick, simple, and inexpensive proceeding that requires no trial and none of the delays or expenses incident to a separate and independent action.<br\/><br\/>Furthermore, the procedure by action robs the\u00a0 court below of the discretion which it would exercise in the decision of a motion.\u00a0 As was just intimated, the court, in deciding a motion to vacate an order confirming\" a sale in foreclosure should exercise sound discretion; and its action will not be disturbed unless there clearly appears an abuse of that discretion.\u00a0 In an action a court cannot exercise discretion.\u00a0 An action is governed by and decided upon legal principles and the court can exercise no discretion in the decision of the case.\u00a0 If it makes a mistake in the decision, that mistake is an error which will reverse the judgment if it be prejudicial of a substantial right.\u00a0 In resolving a motion the court may exercise its sound discretion, and its action will not be reversed except when there clearly appears to have been an abuse of discretion.\u00a0 An action will not lie to set aside a default whether it occur with or without fault or negligence of the plaintiff.\u00a0 A motion is the proper proceeding.<br\/><br\/>(2) The complaint is not sufficient, even though the action be the proper proceeding.\u00a0 It does not allege a single fact against the regularity or validity of the sale.\u00a0 It should be noted that, according to the allegations of the complaint as construed by the\u00a0 plaintiff herself, the action is not one to set aside the sale for fraud, misconduct, or irregularity in the sale itself.\u00a0 The only irregularity alleged, namely, the failure of notice of the hearing to confirm, relates solely to the <i>confirmation<\/i> of the sale.\u00a0 The complaint therefore, shows no reason for setting it aside.<br\/><br\/>As I have already said, it is perfectly clear,\u00a0 of course, that an action to set aside a sale must be based upon irregularity, fraud or misconduct in the sale itself.\u00a0 The complaint in this case alleges no irregularity, fraud or misconduct, and therefore in no way attacks the validity of the sale.\u00a0 The isolated statement that \"the lands in question are worth P15,000 and in the said foreclosure sale were sold for less than half their value, to the great injury of the plaintiff,\" is not sufficient.\u00a0 In the\u00a0 case of Warner, Barnes &amp; Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Santos (14 Phil.\u00a0 Rep., 446), the court said at page\u00a0 449:<br\/><blockquote>\"The basis of the objection of the defendant in the lower court was that he was able to obtain from another person about P800 more than the sheriff received from the person to whom he sold said property.\u00a0 This person was not discovered by the defendant until ten or twelve days after the sale took place, No objection is made by the defendant that the sale was not duly advertised or that there was any collusion on the part of the sheriff or the other parties interested in the sale.\u00a0 It is the duty of the court, of course, in the sale of property under the conditions of the present case, to obtain as much money for the judgment debtor out of his property as it is possible.\u00a0 This duty on the part of the court, however, does not justify negligent delay in an attempt to protect his rights on the part of the said judgment debtor.<br\/><br\/>\"In the present case the defendant made no attempt to defend his rights until some days after judgment, execution, and sale.\u00a0 The Supreme Court of the United States has held in numerous decisions,\u00a0 that a sale under foreclosure proceedings would not be set aside upon the ground that the sheriff did not receive as much money as he might have received, providing all of the proceedings were valid and regular, unless the sale was made for a sum grossly inadequate in comparison with the real value of the property.<br\/><br\/>\"A judicial sale of real estate will not be set aside for inadequacy of price unless the inadequacy be so great as to shock the conscience or unless there be additional circumstances against its fairness.\u00a0 (Graffam et al. <i>vs<\/i>. Burgess, 117 U. S., 180; Schroeder <i>vs<\/i>. Young, 161 U. S., 334; Livingston <i>vs<\/i>. Byrne, 11 Johnson (N. Y.), 555; Eberhardt <i>vs<\/i>. Gilchrist, 11\u00a0 N. J, Equity, 167; Montague <i>vs<\/i>. Dawes, 14 Allen (Mass.), 369;\u00a0 Drinan <i>vs<\/i>. Nichols, 115 Mass., 353.)<br\/><br\/>\"While mere inadequacy of price under judicial sales has rarely been held sufficient to justify the setting aside of a judicial sale of property, courts will not be slow to seize upon this or other circumstances impeaching the fairness of the transaction as cause for vacating such judicial sales, especially if the inadequacy be so gross as to shock the conscience.\u00a0 (Schroeder <i>vs<\/i>. Young, 161 U. S., 334; Byers <i>vs<\/i>. Surget, 19 Howard, 303; Pacific Railroad Company <i>vs<\/i>. Ketchum, 101 U. S., 289.)\"<\/blockquote>Wiltsie in his work on Mortgage Foreclosure says, volume 2, page 1338: \"The general rule is that mere inadequacy of price brought by\u00a0 mortgaged premises on sale under a decree of foreclosure, is not sufficient ground for setting aside the sale and ordering a resale, in the absence of any showing of fraud, collusion, unfairness, or oppression, unless so gross as necessarily to raise the inference of fraud or imposition; or in the absence of evidence tending to show bad faith, unfairness in the conduct of the sale, the deterring of bidders, an undue advantage taken of the ignorance or weakness of the persons whose property rights are affected by the sale, or other circumstances tainting the transaction with fraud, and entitling the parties injuriously affected to equitable relief.<br\/><blockquote>\"Nor will a sale be set aside and a resale ordered upon the mere expression of opinion that the property on a resale would bring a much higher price; it must be shown affirmatively that it will sell for a larger price.\u00a0 A resale will not be ordered upon a mere guaranty of an advance price; or upon a mere statement founded only upon information that some of the bondholders deterred other proposed buyers, not named, from bidding, by creating an impression that they were going to bid a much larger sum for the property, where in fact they only clothed their committee with a discretion to buy the property at any price limited only by such sum.\u00a0 Neither will a resale be ordered upon a mere conjecture or\u00a0 surmise that if\u00a0 the property had been offered for sale at another season it would have brought a better price, when it is not shown that any person with capital or means was prevented from attending.\"<\/blockquote>From these authorities it is clear that the allegation of the complaint relative to inadequacy of price is not, standing alone, always sufficient to put the defendant to answer.<br\/><br\/>Moreover, that objection, if plaintiff meant it to be an objection, was\u00a0 abandoned on appeal.\u00a0 The only error assigned touching the validity of the sale is that numbered 3, alleging that \"the lower court erred in not holding that the sheriff's sale in question should have been set aside, inasmuch as the sale had been confirmed <i>ex parte<\/i> without notifying the appellant of the hearing to confirm the same.\"\u00a0 The only reference in appellant's brief to this particular objection was made in his \"statement of facts\" in which appears the following paragraph:<br\/><blockquote>\"In accordance with the order of confirmation the provincial sheriff of Laguna executed a deed of sale of the land in question to the appellee, which land was actually worth, at the time of the sale, the sum of P15,000, whereupon the appellant filed this action in the Court of First Instance against the defendant, asking that the sale above referred to be annulled and that plaintiff be permitted to redeem the said land in question, satisfying the mortgage in its entirety, and asking any other remedy which, in accordance with the facts, the court may deem just and expedient.\"<\/blockquote>The argument of counsel is wholly taken up in discussing, first, the alleged error of the court in refusing to accept the amended complaint; second, in confirming the\u00a0 sale without notice to the plaintiff, and third, in holding that plaintiff had not offered to repurchase.\u00a0 There is not a word in all the argument referring to the inadequacy of price or predicating any right to relief thereon.<br\/><br\/>It is apparent, therefore, that there is not an allegation in the\u00a0 complaint which in the remotest way touches the validity of the sale itself.\u00a0 The whole attack of plaintiff is clearly\u00a0 directed against the <i>order confirming the sale<\/i>.\u00a0 Her only objection against the foreclosure proceeding from beginning to end is that she received no notice of the hearing upon the motion to confirm.\u00a0 That is the only basis upon which 'the action is brought.\u00a0 This, as I have said before, in no way touches the validity of the sale.\u00a0 The setting aside of the order confirming the sale has no effect whatever upon the sale itself.\u00a0 The only purpose which can underlie a proceeding to vacate an order confirming the sale is to give the party an\u00a0 opportunity to be present at the hearing and to\u00a0 take such action in opposition to the confirmation as she has.\u00a0 Such purpose cannot be subserved by an action to set aside the sale.\u00a0 The procedure should have been by motion.\u00a0 But on such a motion, the plaintiff, to be within the rule, would have been obliged to allege and prove that the sale was irregular or that there was fraud or misconduct therein and that she was prejudiced by reason thereof.\u00a0 Without such allegations and sufficient proof thereof, the order of confirmation would not have been disturbed even though she admittedly had no notice of the hearing.\u00a0 This is clear, for, if the moving party has no legal objection to make to the sale, why set aside the confirmation ?\u00a0 Courts do not spend their time and vacate their proceedings to give persons an apportunity to present objections when they admittedly have no objections to present.\u00a0 The order is not void; the court had jurisdiction to make it; the failure to give notice was a mere irregularity, a false step in a proceeding over which the court had complete jurisdiction. It cannot, therefore, be set aside for nought.<br\/><br\/>Although the court, as we have seen from the decision,states that \"this is\u00a0 an action to set aside a sheriff's sale\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 on the ground that the sale was irregularly confirmed by the court,\" nevertheless, later in the opinion the court puts this as a question before\u00a0 it:\u00a0 \"The question whether or not a mortgagor is entitled as a matter or right to notice of the hearing for the approval of the sheriff's sale is directly raised, or, in other words, if the sale of mortgaged property is approved without giving the mortgagor an opportunity to be heard, is such approval valid and sufficient to pass title?\"<br\/><br\/>Referring to the first part of the question, or rather the first question, as there are two questions presented by the quotation instead of one, I do not see that the question stated by the court is raised in any way.\u00a0 What has the irregularity of a <i confirmation=\"\"><\/i> to do with setting aside the <i>sale<\/i>!\u00a0 A motion to vacate an,order confirming a sale is based upon grounds entirely different\u00a0 from those urged in a motion to set aside a sale.\u00a0 In this very case the reason alleged as a ground for setting aside the order of confirmation, namely, the failure of notice, is no ground whatever for setting aside the sale itself.<br\/><br\/>Relative to the second part of the quotation, what relevancy has the question whether or not the confirmation passes the title to the mortgaged premises in an action to set aside a sale?\u00a0 If the plaintiff has a right to set aside the sale, it is of no\u00a0 consequence how the title passes or when it passes.\u00a0 The right to set aside a sale depends on the validity and regularity of the sale and these matters have no connection with the passing of the title.\u00a0 In the same way, the right to set aside an order confirming a sale has no possible relation or connection with the title, how it passes, or when it passes.\u00a0 As the right to set aside a sale depends upon events which occurred during the conduct of the sale and has no relation to its legal effects, so the right to set aside an order of confirmation rests upon events which occurred during the process of such confirmation and does not depend at all upon the legal effects which follow such confirmation.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, the finding by the court \"that no title passes under a sheriff's sale of mortgaged real property until the sale is confirmed by the court having jurisdiction appears to be clear from the reading of the above section,\" and that \"the confirmation operates to divest the title out of the former owner and to vest it in the purchaser,\" and that \"it is at this time when the rights of title pass, and not before,\" are findings which, in my humble\u00a0 opinion, are quite disconnected with any question legitimately arising in an action to set aside a sale, or to vacate an order confirming the sale.\u00a0 Those would, perhaps, be pertinent in an action to redeem, as they might have some influence on the time when the right to redeem expired; but, in an action to set aside a\u00a0 sale, or an order confirming a sale, those questions are wholly immaterial.\u00a0 The error, if I may call it such, into which the court fell in defining the question before it as set out hereinabove and in making the findings just referred to arose, in my judgment, from the fact that, while the court and the parties have treated this action as one to set aside a sale, there has, nevertheless, remained the inherent and almost insurmountable difficulty arising from the fact, as I have above stated, that the object of the action is really and essentially to redeem.\u00a0 Both the parties and the court if I may be permitted to say so, have mistaken the nature of the action, and confusion as to the real question raised necessarily results.<br\/><br\/>For the same reasons, the discussion of the court relative to the moment when the right to redeem is destroyed is, in my humble opinion, immaterial in this action.\u00a0 As much may be said, I think, in regard to its discussion of whether or not the mortgagee has a statutory right to redeem beyond the time when the sale is confirmed and deed delivered to the purchaser.\u00a0 As a necessary result the finding of the court with respect to the existence of that statutory right that \"there is no such privilege extended to him by statute in the Philippine Islands' and that \"the right of the mortgagor and those claiming under him to redeem from the mortgage is extinguished by the foreclosure when same has been properly made,\" are findings and decisions upon questions not involved in the action as defined by the parties and the court.<br\/><br\/>As I have before intimated, the mere fact that the plaintiff had no\u00a0 notice of the motion to confirm the sale is not sufficient of itself to set the\u00a0 order of confirmation aside.\u00a0 She must have been prejudiced in her substantial rights by reason of some defect\u00a0 in the <i>sale<\/i>; otherwise she has, no standing on the motion.\u00a0 What is the object of setting the order of confirmation aside if the plaintiff has no complaint to make against the sale itself?\u00a0 It would be nonsense for the court to set aside its order and allow the plaintiff to be heard on the motion to confirm if the plaintiff had no complaint to make against the regularity or validity of the sale.\u00a0 A court will not set aside an order already made\u00a0 unless that action will benefit some one.\u00a0 So far as appears in this case not the slightest benefit would be conferred upon the plaintiff by setting aside the order of confirmation.\u00a0 She has no complaint to make against the sale or against the confirmation of the sale.\u00a0 The only possible purpose of a hearing on a confirmation is to give the mortgagor an opportunity to allege something\u00a0 against the regularity or validity of the sale.\u00a0 That is the only thing the mortgagor can do upon a hearing to confirm.\u00a0 She could not be heard to say that the sale ought not to be confirmed because it would cut off\u00a0 the equity of redemption.\u00a0 That is the legal and necessary effect of a sale.\u00a0 Therefore, the mortgagor cannot be heard to say in this action that the confirmation of the sale prejudiced her because it cut off her right of redemption, nor can she urge that as a reason why she should have the order of confirmation set aside.\u00a0 The allegation of plaintiff that, if she had been notified of the motion to confirm and the hearing thereon, she would have redeemed the premises before the confirmation took place, can have no bearing.<br\/><br\/>The prejudice suffered by the failure to receive notice of the motion to confirm must, to warrant the vacating of the decree of confirmation, result from the decree directly.\u00a0 It cannot be a mere incident to the decree nor result remotely therefrom.\u00a0 The prejudice must be the necessary and immediate result of the decree.\u00a0 The fact, if it is a fact, that the order of confirmation is the act which divests the interests of the mortgagor and invests those interests in the purchaser is no reason in itself for setting aside that order.\u00a0 Unless the moving party can show that he could have attacked the sale on legal grounds and was prevented from so doing by the fact that he received no notice of the hearing on the motion to confirm, he has no standing on the motion.\u00a0 The fact that the order of confirmation was the last step in the foreclosure proceeding and was, therefore, the final act destroying forever the plaintiff's right to redeem has no significance in a motion to vacate that order.\u00a0 As a matter of fact, it is not really the order of confirmation that does the mischief; it is the sale.\u00a0 If there is a valid sale, the order of confirmation follows of necessity; and the court has no right to withhold it.\u00a0 It is the absolute right of the mortgagee to have a valid sale confirmed; no one can prevent it.\u00a0 The fact, if it is a fact, that the confirmation destroys the right to redeem has no significance.\u00a0 If the mortgagor can offer no objections to the sale, the confirmation was not only proper-it was necessary; and a refusal to confirm would have been error.<br\/><br\/>It is clear, therefore, that the only possible basis for opening the order of confirmation is to give a laintiff an opportunity to object to the sale.\u00a0 This she does not desire to do.\u00a0 Her purpose seems to be simply to redeem.\u00a0 Believing that the confirmation of the sale was the final act in a proceeding to destroy her equity\u00a0 of redemption she seeks to have that confirmation set aside that she may redeem.\u00a0 She is not entitled to that relief.<br\/><br\/>Finally, it should be noted what\u00a0 effect this\u00a0 decision will have upon the court below when the cause is returned for trial.\u00a0 The majority holds that the failure to notify the mortgagor of the hearing on the motion to confirm is sufficient to set aside not the order of confirmation\u00a0 but the sale itself.\u00a0 Therefore, when this case goes back to the Court of First Instance, all that the plaintiff has to do to set aside the sale, against the validity of which absolutely nothing has been alleged, is to prove that he did not receive notice of the hearing to confirm.\u00a0 This presents a situation which, in judgment, is unique.<br\/><br\/>The judgment below is correct and should be affirmed.<br\/><br\/><br\/><hr align=\"LEFT\" noshade=\"NOSHADE\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/> <sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> 17 Phil.

ALBERTO BARRETTO, JUDGE OF FIRST INSTANCE OF RIZAL, AND CONSTANCIO JOAQUIN, RESPONDENTS.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>MORELAND, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">This is an application for a writ of certiorari to the Court of First Instance of the Province of Rizal.<br\/><br\/>It appears that on or about the 1st of March, 1913, Constancio Joaquin, believing himself entitled to a license to open and exploit a cockpit in the municipality of Caloocan, and the authorities thereof refusing to issue it to him, began an action against Godofredo B. Herrera as municipal president of said municipality, the officer whose duty he claimed it was to issue cockpit licenses, to obtain a mandamus compelling said official to issue such license.<br\/><br\/>On the presentation of the verified complaint and upon the facts stated therein and the exhibits annexed thereto, the plaintiff asked that the court issue a mandatory injunction directed to the defendant requiring him to issue a provisional license under which the\u00a0 plaintiff might conduct his cockpit during the pendency of the action.\u00a0 The court, in pursuance of such request and upon the facts stated in the complaint and exhibits annexed thereto, issued such order <i>ex parte<\/i> without notice to the defendant.<br\/><br\/>Thereupon the defendant in that action began a proceeding in this court against the judge of the Court of First Instance who had issued the mandatory injunction relative to the provisional license referred to, Honorable Alberto Barretto, and Constancio Joaquin, plaintiff therein, for a writ of certiorari, alleging that the court below had acted without jurisdiction in the following particulars:<br\/><blockquote>\"1. That the said Honorable Alberto Barretto exceeded his jurisdiction in issuing a mandatory injunction, because, according to paragraph (<i>j<\/i>), section 40, of the Municipal Code and article 4 of municipal ordinance No. 8 of Caloocan (Exhibit 1 <i>a<\/i>), the issuance, of cockpit licenses in Loma and Maypajo does not pertain to the municipal president of Caloocan but to the municipal council thereof.<br\/><br\/>\"2. That the\u00a0 said Honorable Alberto Barretto exceeded his jurisdiction in issuing the mandatory injunction <i>ex parte<\/i> without giving the municipal president opportunity to show cause why such injunction should not be issued as required by section 202 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br\/><br\/>\"3. That the said Alberto Barretto exceeded his jurisdiction in issuing such mandatory injunction for the reason that the cockpit license which the president of Caloocan had erroneously issued in favor of Constancio Joaquin, on the_______day of_______,1913, has been annulled and canceled by virtue of ordinance No._______of the municipal council of Caloocan, which ordinance has been duly approved by the provincial board of Rizal.<br\/><br\/>\"4. That there being another action pending between the same parties, founded upon the same facts and reasons, the Court of First Instance of Rizal had no jurisdiction to issue the mandatory injunction of the 1st of March, 1913 (Exhibit 4), for the reason that such injunction tends to render inefficacious and null the final decision which this honorable court will render in civil cause No. 8673.\"<\/blockquote>The action referred to in this paragraph is one begun by Antonio Bertol and Tranquilina T., widow of Angeles, against Godofredo B. Herrera and others relating to the validity of a certain ordinance.<br\/><blockquote>\"5. That there being pending civil cause No. 986 mentioned in the previous\u00a0 paragraphs, the Court of First Instance of Rizal lacked jurisdiction to issue the\u00a0 mandatory injunction which he issued on the 1st of March, 1913, for the reason that it tends to render inefficacious and null the decision which the Honorable Richard Campbell will render in civil cause No. 986.\"<\/blockquote>This objection is based upon an action previously begun by Antonio\u00a0 Bertol and Tranquilina T., widow of Angeles, against the municipality or the officials thereof for the purpose of having declared null and void municipal ordinance No. 8 of Caloocan, which is the same ordinance upon which was based the complaint of Constancio Joaquin and in which the mandatory injunction was issued.<br\/><blockquote>\"6. That the said Constancio Joaquin at the present time does not possess a license to maintain and run the said cockpits of Loma and Maypajo, nor does he have the right to exploit the same.\"<\/blockquote>It has been repeatedly held by this court that a writ of certiorari will not be issued unless it clearly appears that the court to which it is to be directed acted without or in excess of jurisdiction.\u00a0 It will not be issued to cure errors in the proceedings or to correct erroneous conclusions of law or of fact.\u00a0 If the court has jurisdiction of the subject matter and of the person, decisions upon all questions pertaining to the cause are decisions within its jurisdiction and, however irregular or erroneous they may be, cannot be corrected by certiorari.\u00a0 The Code of Civil Procedue giving Courts of First Instance general jurisdiction in actions for mandamus, it goes without saying that the Court of First Instance had jurisdiction in the present case to\u00a0 resolve every question arising in such an action and to decide every question presented to it which pertained to the cause.\u00a0 It has already been held by this\u00a0 court that, while it is a power to be exercised only in extreme cases, a Court of First Instance has power to issue a mandatory injunction to stand until the final determination of the action in which it is issued.\u00a0 While the issuance of the mandatory injunction in this particular case may have been irregular and erroneous, a question concerning which we express no opinion, nevertheless its issuance was within the jurisdiction of the court and its action is not reviewable on certiorari.\u00a0 It is not sufficient to say that it was issued wrongfully and without sufficient grounds and in the absence of the other party.\u00a0 The question is, did the court act with jurisdiction?<br\/><br\/>It has been urged that the court exceeded its jurisdiction in requiring the municipal president to issue the license, for the reason that he was not the proper person to issue it and that, if he was the proper person, he had the right to exercise a discretion as to whom the license should be issued.\u00a0 We do not believe that either of these, questions goes to the jurisdiction of the court to act.\u00a0 One of the fundamental questions in a mandamus against a public officer is whether or not that officer has the right to exercise discretion in the performance of the act which the plaintiff asks him to perform.\u00a0 It is one of the essential determinations of the cause.\u00a0 To claim that the resolution of that question may deprive the court of jurisdiction is to assert a novel proposition.\u00a0 It is equivalent to the contention that a court has jurisdiction if he decides right but no jurisdiction if he decides wrong.\u00a0 It may be stated generally that it is never necessary to decide the fundamental questions of a cause to determine whether the court has jurisdiction.\u00a0 The question of jurisdiction is preliminary and never touches the merits of the case.\u00a0 The determination of the fundamental questions of a cause are merely the exercise of a jurisdiction already conceded.\u00a0 In the case at bar no\u00a0 one denies the\u00a0 power,\u00a0 authority, or jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance to take cognizance of an action for mandamus and to decide every question which arises in that cause and pertains thereto.\u00a0 The contention that the decision of one of those questions, if wrong, destroys jurisdiction involves an evident contradiction.<br\/><br\/>Jurisdiction is the authority to hear and determine cause\u2014the right to act in a case.\u00a0 Since it is the power to hear and determine, it does not depend either upon the regularity of the exercise of that power or upon the rightfulness of the decisions made.\u00a0 Jurisdiction should therefore be distinguished from the exercise of jurisdiction.\u00a0 The authority to decide a cause at all, and not the decision rendered therein, is\u00a0 what makes up jurisdiction.\u00a0 Where there is jurisdiction of the person and subject matter, as we have said before, the decision of all other questions arising in the case is but an exercise of that jurisdiction.<br\/><br\/>In the case of Chase vs. Christianson (41 Cal., 253), the court said:\u00a0 \"Here, then, was jurisdiction of the\u00a0 subject matter and of the person, and, these conditions conceded, the decision of all other questions arising in the case is but the exercise of that jurisdiction, and an erroneous decision of any of these other questions could not impair the validity and binding force of the judgment when brought in question collaterally.<br\/><blockquote>\"It is not the particular decision given which makes up jurisdiction, but it is the authority to decide the question at all.\u00a0 Otherwise all distinction between erroneous exercise of jurisdiction upon the one hand, and a total want of it upon the other, must be obliterated.\"<\/blockquote>In the case of Freeman <i>vs<\/i>. Thompson (53 Mo., 183), the following is quoted with approval from Paine <i>vs<\/i>. Mooreland (15 Ohio, 435):\u00a0 \"The court once having, by its process, acquired the power to adjudicate upon a person or thing, it has what is called jurisdiction.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 The distinction is between a lack of power or want of jurisdiction in the court, and a wrongful or defective execution of the power.\u00a0 In the first instance, all acts of a court, not having jurisdiction or power, are void; in the latter, voidable only.\u00a0 A court, then, may act, first, without power or jurisdiction; second, having power or jurisdiction, may exercise it wrongfully; or third, irregularly.\u00a0 In the first instance the act or judgment of the court is wholly void, and is as though it had not been done; the second is wrong and must be reversed upon error;\u00a0 the third is irregular and must be corrected by motion.\"<br\/><br\/>In Hardin <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs.<\/span> Lee (51 Mo., 241), the court said:\u00a0 \"The judgment though grossly erroneous was not void, the court having acquired jurisdiction of the subject matter.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 In a word, error and nullity are not legal equivalents or synonyms.\"<br\/><br\/>In Hagerman <i>vs<\/i>. Sutton (91 Mo., 519), the court said:\u00a0 \"The power to decide correctly and to enforce a decision when correctly\u00a0 made necessarily implies the same power to decide incorrectly and to enforce a decision when incorrectly made.\u00a0 (Devis vs. Packard, 10 Wend., 71.)\"<br\/><br\/>In Paine <i>vs<\/i>. Mooreland (15\u00a0 Ohio, 435), the court said:\u00a0 \"The distinction is between a lack of power or want of jurisdiction in the court, and a wrongful or defective execution\u00a0 of the power.\u00a0 In the first instance all acts of the court, not having jurisdiction or power, are\u00a0 void; in the latter voidable only.\"<br\/><br\/>In the case of Colton <i>vs<\/i>. Beardsly (38 Barb., 51), the court said:\u00a0 \"The test of jurisdiction is, whether the court has power to enter on the inquiry, and not whether its decision is right or wrong.\"<br\/><br\/>In Wertheimer <i>vs<\/i>. Boonville (29 Mo., 254), the court said:\u00a0 \"It is hard to conceive how the question of jurisdiction can be made to depend on the fact whether the judgment was right or wrong.\u00a0 The mayor unquestionably has authority to decide whether the ordinance had\u00a0 been violated, and after he has determined it, how can it be said he had no jurisdiction?\"<br\/><br\/>In O'Reilly <i>vs<\/i>. Nicholson (45 Mo., 160), the court said:\u00a0 \"A judgment, though informal, even to the extent of granting a relief\u00a0 not contemplated in the petition, when the parties are before the court and the relief is within its jurisdiction, is not a void proceeding.\u00a0 The doctrine laid down in Fithian <i>vs<\/i>. Monks (43 Mo., 502), in that it fails to make the readily observable distinction between jurisdiction to act in a given cause, and erroneous exercise of such jurisdiction,\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 should no longer be followed.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 Jurisdiction being acquired error could not oust it, although that error consisted in granting relief not warranted by law.' \"<br\/><br\/>In the case of Gray <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs.<\/span> Bowles (74 Mo., 419), the court said:\u00a0 \"When a court has jurisdiction of the subject matter of the action and the parties to it, a judgment rendered by it, although it may be an erroneous, irregular, or wrong judgment, cannot be said to be void, but remains valid and binding until reversed or set aside on the ground of such error or irregularity.\"<br\/><br\/>In State <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs.<\/span> Second Judicial District (24 Mont, 238), the court said:\u00a0 \"A judgment was rendered against Baker, who appealed but could not furnish the necessary bonds or security on appeal.\u00a0 The purpose of this application is to set aside the judgment, the relator asserting that the district court was without jurisdiction.\u00a0 The right to hear and determine necessarily carries with it the power to decide wrong as well as right.\u00a0 It did not exceed its jurisdiction although the court may have erred, yet it regularly pursued its authority.\u00a0 Certiorari may not be used to correct errors committed within the jurisdiction of the court.\"<br\/><br\/>In Central Pac. <i>vs<\/i>. Board (43\u00a0 Cal., 365), the court said:\u00a0 \"Mere irregularity intervening in the exercise of an admitted jurisdiction\u2014mere mistakes of law committed in conducting the proceedings in an inquiry which the Board had authority to entertain,\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 are not to be considered here upon certiorari, otherwise that writ would be turned into a writ of error.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 Jurisdiction over a question presented being conceded, carries with it necessarily the authority\u2014the mere power\u2014to decide the question either way.\"<br\/><br\/>In Lewis <i>vs<\/i>. Larson (45 Wis., 353), the court said:\u00a0 \"The judgment of a justice of the peace will not be reversed on a common-law certiorari, if the justice had jurisdiction to render it, no matter how irregular or erroneous it may be.\"<br\/><br\/>In the case of Utah Association <i>vs<\/i>. Budge (16 Idaho, 751), the court said:\u00a0 \"If the court had jurisdiction of the person and the subject matter, then it is clear that whatever mistake has been made has been only an error committed on the part of the trial court in exercising his judgment and applying the law to the case, rather than\u00a0 an excess of jurisdiction in acting in a matter wherein he had not acquired jurisdiction to act or wherein his court has no jurisdiction of the subject in litigation.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 The court had the jurisdiction, power, and authority to hear and determine that question.\u00a0 It accordingly did so.\u00a0 If the court committed an error in deciding the question thus presented, we answer that the court had jurisdiction to commit the error.\"<br\/><br\/>Although certiorari may be considered a direct attack upon a judgment as distinguished from a collateral attack, nevertheless, under the laws of these Islands the only ground for the issuance of certiorari being the failure of jurisdiction of the inferior tribunal, the basis of the direct attack upon the judgment becomes in this jurisdiction the same as for collateral attack, inasmuch as, generally speaking, a collateral\u00a0 attack against a judgment is sustainable only when the judgment is void for lack of jurisdiction in the court to pronounce it.\u00a0 Therefore the authorities relative to the ground necessary for a successful collateral attack upon a judgment are authorities in a large sense, pertinent to a discussion as to when a court may be held to have acted without or in excess of jurisdiction.<br\/><br\/>In the case of Cooper <i>vs<\/i>. Reynolds (10 Wall., 308), the court said:\u00a0 \"It is of no avail, therefore, to show that there are errors in the record, unless they be such as prove that the court had no jurisdiction of the case, or that the judgment rendered was beyond its power.\u00a0 This principle has been often held by this court and by all courts, and it takes rank as an axiom of the law.\"<br\/><br\/>In the case of Cornett <i>vs<\/i>. Williams (20 Wall., 226), it was declared that \"the settled rule of law is, that jurisdiction having attached in the original case, everything done within the power of that jurisdiction, when collaterally questioned, is to be held conclusive of the rights of the parties, unless impeached for fraud.\"<br\/><br\/>These two cases were cited and approved in the case of Manson vs. Duncanson (166 U. S., 533), wherein the court said:\u00a0 \"When a court has jurisdiction it has a right to decide every question that may\u00a0 arise in the cause; and whether its decisions be correct or not, its judgment, until reversed, is regarded as binding in every other court.\u00a0 These principles apply in all respects and with special force in this case.\u00a0 It was for the court whose decree is attempted to be impeached, not only to decide on the facts before it, but upon the construction and legal effect of all deeds and muniments of title upon which the proceeding was based.\u00a0 The court having\u00a0 general jurisdiction over the subject matter of decreeing the sale of real estate of a deceased debtor for the payment of debts, it had the right and was required to determine the question as to the liability of the property for the debts, and whether the case was within its jurisdiction; and though its decision may have been erroneous, it could only be reversed upon a direct appeal.\"<br\/><br\/>See Shepard <i>vs<\/i>.

Rowan (251 111., 344), the court said:\u00a0 \"A judgment or decree is not binding upon anyone unless the court rendering the same had jurisdiction\u00a0 of the parties and the subject matter of the cause.\u00a0 The court did have jurisdiction of the parties, and the appellant, who is disputing the binding effect of the decree, was one of the complainants.\u00a0 Jurisdiction of the subject matter is the power to adjudge concerning the general question involved, and if a bill states a case belonging to a general class over which the authority of\u00a0 the court extends, the jurisdiction attaches and no error committed by the court can render the judgment void.\u00a0 It the court has jurisdiction, it is altogether immaterial, when the judgment is collaterally called in question, how grossly irregular or manifestly\u00a0 erroneous its proceedings may have been.\u00a0 The judgment cannot be regarded as a nullity, and cannot, therefore, be collaterally impeached.\u00a0 Such a judgment is binding on the parties and on every other court unless reversed or annulled in a direct proceeding and is not open to collateral attack.\u00a0 If there is a total want of jurisdiction in a court its proceedings are an absolute nullity and confer no right and afford no protection but will be pronounced void when collaterally drawn in question.\u00a0 (Buckmaster <i>vs<\/i>.

Rep., 132), the court said:\u00a0 \"Under the provisions of the code in certiorari proceedings, it is necessary that it should appear both that the inferior court has exceeded its jurisdiction and that there is no appeal from such court.\"<br\/><br\/>In his concurring opinion Judge Willard says: \"Considering the existence of facts which may confer jurisdiction, the question of whether those facts are presented in such a manner in the affidavit as to invoke the exercise of this jurisdiction is one\u00a0 which the court has the same right to determine as it would have in the decision of any other questions which might arise in a matter within its recognizance.\u00a0 In the exercise of this power it may issue an erroneous order, but such an order is not absolutely void; unless it is remedied during the same action by means of an appeal or otherwise, it will have the effect of a valid order.\u00a0 The Court of First Instance should not give a judgment upon a complaint on a promissory note which does not state a cause of action, but if it does so its judgment is valid unless it is reversed by means of appeal.\u00a0 We cannot defer to any decision of the supreme court of California which sustains a contrary doctrine.\u00a0 Article 528, already cited, establishes the law of these Islands, and we must submit to that.\u00a0 To accept the other rule would be to convert the writ of habeas corpus into a writ of error, a thing which is in no wise permissible.\u00a0 It would make it possible for any defendant by means of such writ to interpose an appeal to this court in all those cases in which an order of arrest should be issued and would oblige us to review the errors of law which are alleged to have been committed by the court in investigating the sufficiency of the affidavit, and this is, in our opinion, the very practice which article 528 seeks to avoid.\"<br\/><br\/>In the case of Reyes <i>vs<\/i>. Roxas (1 Phil. Rep., 625), the court held that the refusal to hear witnesses offered by the defense in a criminal action might constitute error, but was not an\u00a0 excess of jurisdiction to be remedied by\u00a0 certiorari, the court saying:\u00a0 \"The complaint in this case does not allege that the court which convicted the petitioner had no jurisdiction to try the case.\u00a0\u00a0 Neither does it allege that in the prosecution of the\u00a0 case there has been any affirmative action by the judge outside of his jurisdiction.\u00a0 It simply alleges that he has failed to take action;\u00a0 that he has refused to hear the witnesses for the defendant.\u00a0 This, if true, would constitute error, but it would be error committed by the judge in the exercise of a jurisdiction which he possessed.\u00a0 The remedy by certiorari does not apply to this case.\"<br\/><br\/>In the case of Dy Chuan Leng <i>vs<\/i>. Ambler (1 Phil. Rep., 535), the court said:\u00a0 \"We cannot grant an injunction under this section unless there is a compliance with articles 164 and 166.\u00a0 It must appear from the complaint that the plaintiff is entitled to recover in the action.\u00a0 If the complaint states no cause of action no preliminary injunction can\u00a0 be issued.\u00a0 The complaint filed in this court is defective in this respect.\u00a0 It shows upon its face that the petitioners are not entitled to an order of prohibition against the court below.\u00a0 That court had jurisdiction of the action to dissolve the partnership.\u00a0 In that action it had the\u00a0 power to grant a preliminary injunction (art. 164), and to appoint a receiver (art. 174).\u00a0 Having those powers, if in the exercise of them any errors were committed, they could be corrected only on appeal from the final judgment.\u00a0 The facts as alleged, that the complaint was ambiguous; that the judge believed that the plaintiff below was a partner when the defendants denied it; that he fixed the bond at $1,000 instead of $30,000, as requested by the defendants; that no mention of the bond was made in the writ of injunction; that he refused to hear the defendants' witnesses; that he refused to dissolve the injunction upon a bond which the defendants offered to give, all of these do not show that the court was acting outside of its jurisdiction.\u00a0 They simply show, if they are true, that the court has committed certain errors in exercising its jurisdiction, errors which must be corrected by appeal.\"<br\/><br\/>In the case of Ivancich <i>vs<\/i>. Odlin (1 Phil. Rep., 284), the court said at page 287:\u00a0 \"The ground upon which the second prohibition is sought is that the attachment ordered by the court is not such an attachment as is authorized by articles 424 <i>et seq<\/i>. of the Code of Civil Procedure of the Philippine Islands, but on the contrary is an attachment under a procedure not in force here, although it is in force in the United States of America in maritime cases, and that the attachment, moreover, was levied without affidavit, bond, or any of the securities established by law whereby the owners of the steamer can obtain reparation for any damages which may be occasioned them by the unlawful detention of the said steamer; and that the procedure of the court below is devoid of all the formal requisites established by law for the levying of such attachments. \"<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"The judge did not, therefore, act <i>without<\/i> jurisdiction when, directing the attachment of the vessel in question, and has not exceeded his jurisdiction.\u00a0 If the excess of jurisdiction upon which the argument was based consists in his having levied the attachment without the fulfillment of the necessary conditions and without following the form prescribed by some law of procedure applicable to the case, it is our opinion that this error is not such an excess of jurisdiction as can be secured by prohibition, and the petitioner has other means whereby this error of procedure may be corrected or remedied.\u00a0 Upon these grounds we decide that the petition for a writ of prohibition must be denied, with the costs to petitioner, and it is so ordered.\"<\/blockquote>In the case of Araneta <i>vs<\/i>. The Heirs of Tranquilino Gustilo (2 Phil. Rep., 60), this court said:\u00a0 \"This is a petition for a writ of certiorari to review the action of the Court of First Instance of Occidental Negros in requiring a supersedeas bond under section 144 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u00a0 It does not appear from the petition what the amount involved in the litigation is, nor in what sum the bond was fixed by the court, but it is alleged that the bond is excessive.\u00a0 The court below had\u00a0 jurisdiction to require the bond as a condition of a stay of execution, and to fix its amount.\u00a0 Assuming that the bond was excessive, yet nothing is alleged in the petition which shows that the court exceeded its jurisdiction in the premises or committed any irregularity in its proceedings in exercise thereof.\u00a0 The writ must therefore be denied.\"<br\/><br\/>In the case of Springer <i>vs<\/i>. Odlin (3 Phil. Rep., 344), the court said:\u00a0 \"The court, on the 30th of May, after hearing both parties, made an order by which it was adjudged that the claim of Co-Banco had a preference over the claim of Springer and ordered the money in the custody of the clerk to be delivered to Co-Banco, but requiring him to execute a bond for the sum of P400 with sureties for the protection of Springer in case he appealed to the Supreme Court to annul the order.<br\/><blockquote>\"The plaintiff, Springer, alleges in his application for certiorari that the Court of First Instance acted without jurisdiction in making this order of the 30th day of May, 1903; that not being a party in the cause of the United States <i>vs<\/i>.

Justice of the Peace of Imus (3 Phil. Rep., 635), the court said:\u00a0 \"Attorneys Pineda and Escueta, on behalf of Flaviano Felizardo and Francisca Felizardo, upon the facts stated by their complaint, dated April 4, 1904, and upon the ground that there was no other speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, pray for an order dissolving the attachment levied upon the property of the petitioners, and that a writ issue to the justice of the peace of Imus, requiring him to absolutely refrain from all further proceedings until a final decision is rendered upon the complaint.<br\/><blockquote>\"By intervening in the suit in which the attachment was levied, the parties may avail themselves of all the legal remedies provided for the defense of their lawful rights, but cannot avail themselves of the writ of prohibition for the purpose of obtaining a discharge of attachment complained of.\u00a0 The case is one which pertains exclusively to the jurisdiction of the judge who is trying it, and there is no authority of law for interference with the proceedings.\"<\/blockquote>In the case of Rubert &amp; Guamis <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>. Sweeney (4 Phil.

(Citing cases.)\u00a0 There is nothing in the case of Yangco <i>vs<\/i>. Rohde (1 Phil.

Rep., 463), the court said:\u00a0 \"Without its being our purpose to decide if the remedy of certiorari invoked by the provincial fiscal is proper in this case or not, we cannot admit his petition on account of its not being made in due form.\u00a0 The remedy of certiorari should be petitioned for by formal complaint having all of the requirements prescribed by the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions, and the petition formulated by the fiscal in the form of a brief in a criminal cause does not come up to these requirements, for which reason it is set aside in accordance with law.\"<br\/><br\/>In the case of Rocha &amp; Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Crossfield (6 Phil. Rep., 355), the court, on page 358, after quoting the section of the Code of Civil Procedure relating to cases\u00a0 in which a receiver may be appointed, said:\u00a0 \"The case at bar does not fall within any of the provisions of this section.\u00a0 There is no allegation in the complaint, as has been before stated, that the plaintiff is the owner of any of the property of Rocha &amp; Co., nor is there any allegation that he has any lien thereon, nor are there any facts alleged in the complaint from which it could be inferred that he was the owner of such property or had any lien thereon.\u00a0 On the contrary, from the facts that are alleged in the complaint it would seem that his separation from the partnership of Carman &amp; Co. left that partnership as a going concern and did not dissolve it.\u00a0 The effect of the provisions of the articles, of partnership which are referred to in the complaint is that after the withdrawal of any partner the remaining partners became the owners of all the assets of the partnership and he became a general creditor of the partnership.<br\/><blockquote><div style=\"text-align: center;\">*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"The case not being one in which a receiver could be appointed, the order making such appointment was void and was beyond the jurisdiction of the court, although that that court had jurisdiction of the main action\u00a0 has been settled adversely to the defendants in this suit by the case of Bonaplata <i>vs.<\/i> Ambler (2 Phil. Rep., 392; see also Encarnacion <i>vs<\/i>. Ambler, 3 Phil. Rep., 623; Findlay &amp; Co, <i>vs<\/i>. Ambler, 3 Phil. Rep.,\u00a0 690).<br\/><br\/>\"That certiorari is the proper remedy in such a case was decided in the case of Blanco <i>vs<\/i>. Ambler (3 Phil. Rep., 358,735).<br\/><br\/>\"In the argument in this court it was claimed that this extraordinary remedy would not lie because the plaintiff, Rocha &amp; Co., had a right to appeal from the order appointing a receiver, although that appeal could not be taken until a final judgment had been entered in the case.\u00a0 That argument is answered by what is said in the case of Yangco <i>vs<\/i>. Rohde (1 Phil. Rep.,\u00a0 404).\"<br\/><br\/>In the case of Ba\u00f1es <i>vs<\/i>. Cordero (13 Phil. Rep., 466), the court said:\u00a0 \"And, if the jurisdiction has not been exceeded, there is not nor could there be any legal ground for the issuance of the writ of certiorari, because these proceedings can only and exclusively be granted to remedy abuses committed in the exercise of a power or jurisdiction.\u00a0 Sections 217 and 514 of the Code of Civil Procedure providing for such relief\u00a0 unequivocally and specifically refer to the act of exceeding or going beyond the jurisdiction; and this court has repeatedly held that, in order that certiorari may issue, it is absolutely necessary to show that the respondent has exceeded his power or jurisdiction.\u00a0 (<i>In re <\/i>Prautch, 1 Phil. Rep., 132; De los Reyes <i>vs<\/i>. Roxas, 1 Phil. Rep., 625; Springer <i>vs<\/i>. Odlin, 3 Phil. Rep., 344.)\"<br\/><br\/>In the case of Arzadon <i>vs<\/i>. Chanco (14 Phil. Rep., 710); the court decided as follows:\u00a0 \"Certiorari is the proper remedy whenever an inferior tribunal, board, or officer exercising judicial functions has exceeded its or his jurisdiction, and no appeal, nor any plain, speedy and adequate remedy exists to correct such excess or extra limitation.\u00a0 (Secs. 217 and 514, Code of Civil Procedure).\u00a0 The jurisdiction of Courts of First Instance to hear and decide election contests is exclusive and final (sec. 27 of the Election Law); consequently, decisions rendered by them in the exercise of said jurisdiction cannot be reviewed by means of an appeal.\u00a0 As they are not appealable and as against them no other\u00a0 plain, speedy and adequate remedy exists, it is evident that they constitute a proper subject for the extraordinary remedy of certiorari.\u00a0 Therefore, if the court below has exceeded his jurisdiction in rendering the abovecited decision it is proper to annul the same by virtue of said proceedings.\"<\/blockquote>In that case the Court of First Instance made the following order: \"By the\u00a0 foregoing, Silvestre Arzadon appears to have violated the provisions of the Election Law which prohibit every action, influence, and promise of any kind, for the purpose of obtaining votes.\u00a0 These should indicate the free will of the voters, and for such infractions his election for the office of municipal president of the town of Badoc must be considered illegal.<br\/><blockquote>\"Therefore, it is decreed by the court that the election of Silvestre Arzadon for the office of president, held on the 5th day of November last in the municipality of Badoc, IIocos Norte, was not legal, and another special election for the said office must be held at the expense of the said Arzadon who shall not then be eligible, and any vote entered in his favor shall not count; the costs and expenses of'these proceedings shall also be charged to him.\"<\/blockquote>In respect to that order the Supreme Court said:\u00a0 \"It is our opinion that he has so exceeded his jurisdiction.\u00a0 The jurisdiction of Courts of First Instance to hear election protests is conferred upon them by the aforesaid section 27 of the Election Law, and neither the said section, nor any other legal provision, authorizes the court, in deciding such protests, to declare ineligible in future elections the person against whom the protest was presented, nor to sentence him to pay the expenses of the new election to be held.\u00a0 Hence, the court below had no power to enter such rulings in the case as gave rise to these proceedings, and in consequence thereof said rulings must be entirely annulled.\"<br\/><br\/>See also Topacio <i>vs<\/i>. Paredes (23 Phil. Rep., 238).<br\/><br\/>The case of Yangco <i>vs<\/i>. Rohde (1 Phil. Rep., 404) was one relating to the allowance of alimony pending the trial of an action for a divorce.\u00a0 The court below allowed alimony although the answer\u00a0 denied the marriage.\u00a0 Prohibition was brought in this\u00a0 court and, after hearing, the lower court was enjoined from levying and collecting alimony.\u00a0 The court said at page 414:\u00a0 \"The court below had jurisdiction to try the divorce suit, but he was without jurisdiction to grant alimony when the right to claim alimony had not accrued in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Code.\u00a0 This code only grants the right to alimony to a <i>wife<\/i>.\u00a0 This status not appearing by a final judgment, the court is without jurisdiction to make any order in the matter.\"<br\/><br\/>See also U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Crossfield (24 Phil. Rep,,\u00a0 321); Young Wampo <i>vs<\/i>. Collector of Customs (id., 431).<br\/><br\/>The reasons given in these cases last cited for the allowance of the writ of prohibition are applicable only to the class of cases with which the decisions deal and do not in any way militate against the general proposition herein asserted.\u00a0 Those which relate to election contests are based upon the principle that those proceedings are special in their nature and must be strictly followed, a material departure from the statute resulting in a loss, or in an excess, of jurisdiction.\u00a0 The cases relating to receivers are based, in a measure, upon the same principle, the appointment of a receiver being governed by the statute; and in part upon the theory that the appointment of a receiver in an improper case is in substance a bankrupcy proceeding, the taking of which is expressly prohibited by law.\u00a0 The case relative to the allowance of alimony <i>pendente lite<\/i> when the answer denies the marriage is more difficult to distinguish.\u00a0 The reasons in support of the doctrine laid down in that case are given in the opinion in full and they seem to place the particular case to which they refer in a class by itself.<br\/><br\/>It is not a light thing that the lawmakers have abolished writs of error and with them certiorari and prohibition, in so far as they were methods by which the mere errors of an inferior court could be corrected.\u00a0 As instruments to that end they no longer exist.\u00a0 Their place is now taken by the appeal.\u00a0 So long as the inferior court retains jurisdiction its errors can be corrected only by that method.\u00a0 The office of the writ of certiorari has been reduced to the correction of defects of <i>jurisdiction<\/i> solely and cannot legally be used for any other purpose.\u00a0 It is truly an extraordinary remedy and, in this jurisdiction, its use is restricted to truly extraordinary cases\u2014cases in which the action of the inferior court is wholly void; where any further steps in the case would result in a waste of time and money and would produce no result whatever; where the parties, or their privies, would be utterly deceived; where a final judgment or decree would be nought but a snare and a delusion, deciding nothing, protecting\u00a0 nobody, a judicial pretension, a recorded falsehood, a standing menace.\u00a0 It is only to avoid such results as these that a writ of certiorari is issuable; and even here an appeal will lie if the\u00a0 aggrieved party prefers to prosecute it.<br\/><br\/>A full and thorough examination of all the decided cases in this court touching the question of certiorari and prohibition fully supports the proposition already stated that, where a Court of First Instance has jurisdiction of the subject matter and of the person, its decision of any question pertaining to the cause, however erroneous, cannot be reviewed by certiorari, but must be corrected by appeal.<br\/><br\/>It must be remembered that the people of the Philippine Islands may go to the Court of First Instance to require a public officer to perform his duties; and they have the right to have that court pass upon the whole case and upon every phase thereof and upon every question arising therein.\u00a0 This right is conferred by statute.\u00a0 It must be respected by the courts as well as by others.\u00a0 It would be manifestly illegal, as it would be flagrantly unjust, so long as the court acts within its jurisdiction, to withdraw from the Court of First Instance the consideration of <i>that case<\/i> under color of any proceeding whatever,\u00a0 As long as the court is considering <i>that case<\/i>, its rights and the rights of the litigants to continue to final determination are inviolate.<br\/><br\/>The fact that another action may have been pending involving the same subject matter and even between the same parties, which was not the fact in this case, does not touch the jurisdiction of the court to act.<br\/><br\/>We cannot leave the case without suggesting that the applicant herein, before coming to this court, should, as the better practice, have made the proper application to the Court of First Instance for a dissolution or modification of the mandatory injunction, and thereby given that court an opportunity, after full argument of counsel and citation of authorities, to pass upon the question of his power and jurisdiction and, even, the correctness and propriety of his action, should power and jurisdiction be found by the court to exist.\u00a0 Questions which Courts of First Instance are required by law to decide should not be summarily taken from them and presented to this court without first giving them an opportunity of deliberately passing on such questions themselves.\u00a0 The most natural and proper thing to do, when such court, in the judgment of one of the parties, has issued an injunction erroneously, is immediately to call the attention of that court to its supposed error and ask for its correction.\u00a0 The strongest reasons of policy and\u00a0 courtesy, if not actual legal right itself, require such procedure; and we discourage all attempts to come to this court upon questions which a court below is entitled to decide without first invoking its judgment thereon.\u00a0\u00a0 There are special reasons for following this course in cases where the court has acted <i>ex parte<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>The writ is denied and the proceeding is dismissed.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

I., the respective descriptions whereof need not be entered in this complaint for the purposes of this suit, which the defendant has occupied and possessed as lessee from January 5, 1892, up to January 5,1904, under the expressly stipulated condition that he would pay as semiannual rent for the said nine parcels of land the sum of 48 pesos and three and a half <i>reales<\/i> Mexican currency, equal and equivalent to the sum of P48.44 Philippine currency.<br\/><br\/>\"III.\u00a0 The defendant has not paid the rent due during said lapse of time, amounting to the sum of P1,162.56 Philippine currency, with the exception of the sums of P25, P50, and P300, more or less, receipts having been issued to him, which he paid on account of his debt because of said rent, for which reason the plaintiff, Leonardo Lucido, for himself and on behalf of his brother, the other plaintiff, Roman Lucido, had to file suit for dispossession against the defendant in this court on February 13, 1904, the matter having been terminated by virtue of a compromise between the parties, drawn up in the following terms:\"<br\/><br\/>[Same as the\u00a0 compromise appearing in Clause IV of the complaint in case No. 7257, <i>ante<\/i>.]<br\/><br\/>\"IV.\u00a0 The defendant, although duly invited and requested by the plaintiffs and by the commission appointed in the compromise above quoted, refused to concur in the settlement of his debt, alleging that he had nothing to settle and that he had paid everything, when in fact he is still in debt to the plaintiffs for the rent of said nine parcels of land and said settlement is still pending, and because of this refusal of the defendant the commission resigned.<br\/><br\/>\"V.\u00a0 If a settlement should be made by the parties in the sense above set forth, the following result would appear:<br\/><blockquote><table border=\"1\" height=\"419\" width=\"100%\"> <tbody><tr> <td height=\"65\" width=\"66%\">\u00a0<\/td> <td width=\"16%\"> <div align=\"center\">Credit<\/div><\/td> <td width=\"18%\"><div align=\"center\">Debit<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td height=\"26\"><p>Rent due for the six-month periods included between the dates January 5, 1892, and January 6, 1904, at M8.44 each.<\/p><\/td> <td>\u00a0<\/td> <td><div align=\"right\">P1,102.56<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td height=\"38\">Payments on account, with receipts issued to the defendant<\/td> <td><div align=\"right\"> <p>P25.00<br\/>50.00<br\/>300.00<\/p> <\/div><\/td> <td>\u00a0<\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td height=\"155\"><p>Amount promised for March 10,1904, which is not yet paid but which<br\/> is now the subject matter of a separate suit betwen the parties<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p><\/td> <td><div align=\"right\">400.00<\/div><\/td> <td><div align=\"right\"> <p>775.00<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td height=\"44\">Balance in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendant<\/td> <td>\u00a0<\/td> <td><div align=\"right\">387.56<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <\/tbody><\/table><\/blockquote>\"VI.\u00a0 The defendant has not paid said balance, or any part thereof, either in the form of monthly installments of P100, which he promised in the compromise above quoted, or in any other way, in spite of the friendly and repeated demands duly made.<br\/><br\/>\"Therefore, the plaintiffs respectfully beg the court, after due proceedings, to render judgment in their favor and against the defendant, declaring an account and settlement between them and sentencing said defendant to pay the plaintiffs the balance of P387.561 Philippine currency, or the amount that appears against him, with legal interest from the date of the filing of this complaint, at one time or in monthly installments of P100, and the\u00a0 costs of the case.\u00a0 The plaintiffs further ask the court for any other remedy in equity and justice.<br\/><br\/>\"Nagcarlan, Laguna, P.

Rep., 116).<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>That Courts of First Instance have jurisdiction in actions to recover the possession of real property illegally detained, together with rents due and damages, even though one year has not expired from the beginning of such illegal detention, provided the question of ownership of such property is also involved.\u00a0 In other words, if the party illegally dispossessed desires to raise the question of illegal dispossession, as well as that of the ownership over the property, he may commence such action in the Court of First Instance immediately or at any time after such illegal dispossession.\u00a0 If he desires to raise the question of illegal possession only, Courts of First Instance do not have original jurisdiction in such a case until after the expiration\u00a0 of one year from the date of the illegal dispossession.\u00a0 The courts of justices of the peace have <i>exclusive original jurisdiction<\/i> in such cases until after one year has expired after the illegal detention.\u00a0 See section 80 of Act No. 190, as amended by section 1 of Act No. 1778; Alonso <i>vs<\/i>.

S. <i>vs<\/i>. Ang Suyco, 17 Phil. Rep., 92; Carroll <i>vs<\/i>. Paredes, 17 Phil. Rep., 94;\u00a0 Davis <i>vs<\/i>. Director of Prisons, 17 Phil. Rep., 168; U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Bernardo, 19 Phil. Rep., 265.)\u00a0 On appeal from the justice of the peace, the appellate court has only such jurisdiction as the justice of the peace had.\u00a0 If the latter had no jurisdiction, the appellate court acquires none by the appeal, provided the jurisdiction of the lower court is\u00a0 put in question in both the lower court and on appeal.\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Bernardo, <i>supra<\/i>.)<\/li><\/ol>In view of the foregoing propositions it becomes necessary, with reference to the first assignment of error, to determine, whether or not the justice of the peace had jurisdiction to try and determine the questions presented by the complaints.\u00a0 The question of the jurisdiction of the justice of the peace was properly and timely raised by demurrer.\u00a0 The justice of the peace reached the conclusion that he did not have jurisdiction to try said causes.\u00a0 He held that the first action (7257) had not been commenced within one year after the alleged illegal possession and that there was another action pending between the same parties for the same cause.\u00a0 He held with reference to the second (7258) that the illegal possession of a tenant begins from the date of his failure to pay the stipulated rents, and that, inasmuch as a number of years had expired without the payment of the stipulated rents, he had no jurisdiction over said cause.\u00a0 With that conclusion of the justice of the peace we cannot agree.\u00a0 It is true that the landlord might, upon the failure of the tenant to pay the stipulated rents, consider the contract broken and demand immediate possession of the rented property, thus converting a legal possession into an illegal possession.\u00a0 Upon the other hand, however, the landlord might conclude to give the tenant credit for\u00a0 the payment of the rents and allow him to continue indefinitely in the possession of the property.\u00a0 In other words, the landlord might choose to give the tenant credit from month to month or from year to year for the payment of the rent, relying upon his honesty or his financial ability to pay the same.\u00a0 During such period the tenant.would not be in illegal possession of the property and the landlord could not maintain an action of <i>desahucio<\/i> until after he had taken steps to convert the legal possession into an illegal possession.\u00a0 A mere failure to pay the rent in accordance with the contract would justify the landlord, after the legal notice, in bringing an action of <i>desahucio<\/i>.\u00a0 The landlord might, however, elect to recognize the contract as still in force and sue for the sums due under it.\u00a0 It would seem to be clear that\u00a0 the landlord might sue for the rents due and unpaid, without electing to terminate the contract of tenancy.\u00a0 Whether he can declare the contract of tenancy broken and sue in an action of <i>desahucio<\/i> for the possession of the property and in a separate action for the rents due and damages, etc., <i>Quaere<\/i>.\u00a0 (Secs. 80 and 84, Act No. 190, amended by Act No. 1778.)<br\/><br\/>In the present cases it\u00a0 appears that the defendant had been in possession of the property under a contract since the year 1892.\u00a0 In the month of March, 1904, the plaintiffs commenced an action to eject the defendant from the possession of said property.\u00a0 By said action the plaintiffs evidently intended to treat the possession of the defendant as an illegal possession.\u00a0 It did not have that effect, however, for the reason that said parties entered into a compromise agreement, by virtue of which the defendant continued in the legal possession of said property.\u00a0 So far as the allegations in the complaints are concerned, there is nothing which shows that the defendant was in the illegal possession of the property, until on or about the 11th day of March 1910, when the plaintiffs, by virtue of the provisions of section 1 of Act No. 1778, gave the defendant the notice required by law, toturn over to them the immediate possession of the\u00a0 property.\u00a0 So far as the complaints show the defendant had been in the legal possession of the property up to and including the time of the notice of March 11, 1910.\u00a0 The action of <i>desahucio<\/i> was commenced by the plaintiffs on the 15th of March, 1910.\u00a0 The illegal possession of the defendant commenced at the time of the notice of March 11, 1910.\u00a0 It is clear, therefore, that the year provided by law within which the action must be brought, if brought before the justice of the peace, had not expired and the justice of the peace had jurisdiction to try the questions presented.\u00a0 The justice of the peace committed an error in sustaining the demurrer and in holding that he was without jurisdiction to hear and determine the questions presented by the complaints.<br\/><br\/>From the judgment of the justice of the peace the plaintiffs appealed to the Court of First Instance, where the same complaints were presented which had been presented in\u00a0 the court of the justice of the peace and the question of jurisdiction was again raised.\u00a0 Upon the issue thus presented, <i>the Court of First Instance had jurisdiction only to determine whether or not the justice of the peace had jurisdiction in said cause<\/i>.\u00a0 Instead of determining that question <i>alone<\/i>, the Court of First Instance decided that it had jurisdiction and ordered the defendant to answer, and proceeded to hear the causes upon their merits.\u00a0 From the final judgments rendered by the Court of First Instance the defendant appealed.<br\/><br\/>Section 16 of Act No. 1627 provides that a judgment, rendered by the Court of First Instance, on an appeal from a judgment of the justice of the peace, shall be final and conclusive, except in cases involving the validity or constitutionality of a statute or a municipal ordinance.\u00a0 Notwithstanding the separate provisions made for an appeal in <i>desahucio<\/i> cases in section 2 of Act No. 1778, we have decided in the cases of Priolo <i>vs<\/i>. Priolo (9 Phil. Rep., 566) and Aragon <i>vs<\/i>. Araullo (11 Phil. Rep., 7) that appeals in the third instance can no longer be resorted to, except in the cases expressly provided for in section 16 of Act No. 1627.\u00a0 Said appeals to this court constitute the third instance.\u00a0 No question of the validity or constitutionality of a statute or a municipal ordinance is presented.<br\/><br\/>Our conclusions are, therefore: <ol> <li>That the justice of the peace committed an error in holding that he had no jurisdiction to try the questions presented in the complaint, in cause No.\u00a0 7257.\u00a0 One year had not elapsed after the illegal detention began.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>That the Court of First Instance committed an error, after determining that the justice of the. peace had jurisdiction, in not returning the cause for trial upon its merits.\u00a0 The plaintiffs, under the law, had a right to have the question tried by the justice of the peace.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>That this Court is without authority to decide the cases upon their merits.<\/li><\/ol>In view of the conclusions which we have reached under the first assignment of error, we deem it unnecessary to discuss the others or to analyze the very interesting argument presented by the appellee in his brief.<br\/><br\/>Considering, therefore, that the justice of the peace has exclusive original jurisdiction to determine the questions presented in the present case, and considering that the parties have a right, under the law, to have the present case tried upon its merits by the justice of the peace, it is hereby ordered that the present appeal be dismissed, without any finding as to costs in any of the instances, with direction that the cause be remanded to the Court of First Instance and that said\u00a0 court is hereby directed to issue an order directing the return of the present cause to the justice of the peace, and that said justice of the peace be directed to proceed to try the cause upon its merits.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres<\/i> and <i>Mapa, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><br\/><br\/><hr align=\"CENTER\" noshade=\"NOSHADE\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>CONCURRING<\/i><br\/><\/div><br\/><b>MORELAND, J.,<\/b><br\/><br\/>Logically this court ought not, perhaps, to enter into a discussion of or decide the question whether the demurrer in the justice's court was properly sustained and the case there dismissed in consequence.\u00a0 That was a question which was presented to the Court of First Instance and was passed by that court without decision\u2014at least not effective decision.\u00a0 The court should have decided that question.\u00a0 If it decided it in the affirmative, the cause should have been returned to the justice's court for trial on the merits.\u00a0 If in the negative, the action in the appellate court should have been dismissed, unless the parties expressly consented to a trial in that, court under its original and not its appellate jurisdiction.\u00a0 Moreover, the questions\u00a0 decided\u00a0 by the Supreme Court on this appeal, namely, the sufficiency of the complaint and the jurisdiction of the justice's court, that is to say, the questions of law raised by the appeal from the justice's court, are questions which could not have reached us if the Court of First Instance had\u00a0 done its duty and decided that question itself.\u00a0 This is\u00a0 so for the reason that such decision would have been final and conclusive so\u00a0 far as the Supreme Court is concerned.\u00a0 Neither of the parties under the law have the right to a third instance.\u00a0 This being the case, it is somewhat illogical for the Supreme Court, simply because the Court of First Instance did not act properly, to take up and decide a question which could not possibly have come before it if the Court of First Instance had acted in accordance with law.\u00a0 Our action then, it seems to me, should be limited to the declaration that the Court of First Instance exceeded its authority in trying the case on the merits when the appeal raised only questions of law.\u00a0 Limiting ourselves to this declaration, the logical course to pursue would be to return the cause to the Court of First Instance for the resolution of the questions of law raised by the appeal.\u00a0 A mistake of the Court of First Instance should not give a party a third instance to which he would not have been entitled but for the mistake.\u00a0 It seems to me, therefore, that in resolving this appeal we should limit ourselves to the decision of questions which are properly before us and which the law intended us to decide, and not those questions which are exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance.<br\/><br\/>It would seem, therefore, that the more logical disposition of the case would be to remand it to the Court of First Instance with instructions to resolve the only questions presented to it on the appeal, namely, whether the allegations of the complaint filed in the justice's court show a cause of action over which that\u00a0 court had\u00a0 jurisdiction, and to act in accordance with the conclusion reached.<br\/><br\/>However, the majority of the Court being in favor of deciding here the questions of law which\u00a0 properly belong to the Court of First Instance and of returning the cause direct to the justice's court\u00a0 for trial, and the result being substantially the same in the end, I yield my judgment to that of my brethren.<br\/><br\/>The only reason for this concurring opinion is to set out another phase of the case which I think should not be overlooked.<br\/><br\/>It is strenously argued that no appeal lies in this case to the Supreme Court, for the reason that, the case having been begun in the justice's court, that section of the Code of Civil Procedure is applicable which provides that \"a judgment rendered by the Court of First Instance on appeal shall be final and conclusive except in cases involving the validity or constitutionality of a statute or municipal ordinance;\" and that there not being involved a question of that nature, the appeal to this court was without authority of law and confers no jurisdiction except to dismiss.<br\/><br\/>My contention is (1) that under the statute relating to appeals from justices' courts an appeal may be taken either upon a question of law alone, or for a new trial; (2) that, if an appeal is on a question of law alone, the Court of First Instance has no jurisdiction to do aught than decide that question of law, and affirm, or reverse and remand, as the case\u00a0 may be; (3) that on such an appeal the Court of First Instance has no jurisdiction to try the case upon the merits; (4) that if it does do so, it does so by virtue of an attempt to exercise its original and not its appellate jurisdiction; (5) that a judgment after such a trial is not a judgment rendered on an appeal from a justice's court, and therefore the prohibition against an appeal to the Supreme Court in a cause originating in the justice's court does not apply; (6) that in an appeal from a judgment after such a trial this court will first examine the questions of law involved, and, if it find that the Court of First Instance tried the case on the merits when the appeal was on questions of law alone, it will reverse and remand to the justice's court for trial, thereby securing to the plaintiff the right which the statute has conferred upon him, that of trying his cause upon the merits in the justice's court.<br\/><br\/>The right to \"appeal,\" as that word is used in the statute granting appeals\u00a0 from justices' courts, is the right to go to the appellate court upon a question of law alone or for a new trial. While no particular procedure is laid down by the Code in cases of appeals on questions of law alone, and while the procedure provided for refers only to appeals for a trial de novo, nevertheless, I am of the opinion that these circumstances furnish no ground for the denial of a right to appeal upon questions of law alone and, consequently as happens in these very cases, the denial of the right to\u00a0 appeal altogether.\u00a0 If a litigant cannot appeal from a justice's court upon a question of law alone, but must always be obliged to accept a new trial in the appellate court, he is denied not only the right to appeal in the particular case, but, by reason of the appellate court's trying the case on the merits, he is deprived of the fundamental right expressly granted to him by statute, namely, the right to try the question of mere possession in the justice's court.<br\/><br\/>The present cases are a clear illustration of the results of the contention that the only appeal permitted from a justice's court\u00a0 is one for a new trial in the Court of First Instance; and that, therefore, every appeal taken from that court, no matter of what kind\u00a0 or nature, makes, for the appellant, a second instance in the appellate court, no matter what the appellate court does, what questions it decides or what powers it\u00a0 invokes.\u00a0 The plaintiff in\u00a0 these cases went into a justice's court and sought to obtain possession of land upon the ground that it was withheld in violation of the statute of unlawful detainer; but was refused the opportunity to try his cause before that court, it being held that the action was one which did not come within its jurisdiction.\u00a0 A demurrer to the complaint was sustained upon that ground and the plaintiff was thereupon summarily dismissed from the court.\u00a0 Upon appeal it was held by the Court of First Instance, and it has been held by this court, that the justice's court had jurisdiction of the subject matter of the actions and should have proceeded with their trial, and that the dismissal of the actions was erroneous.<br\/><br\/>It is, therefore, unquestioned that the plaintiff had the right to have his cause heard by the justice's court by virtue of the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u00a0 The refusal of that court to take cognizance of the action deprived him of that right.\u00a0 It is contended, by those who assert that the only appeal from a justice's court is one for a new trial in the appellate court, that there is no possible way by which the plaintiff in this case can obtain the benefits of his statutory right to have his cause heard in the justice's court, inasmuch as the appeal was of necessity one for a new trial in the appellate court, and his cause would be there heard upon the merits.\u00a0 In other words, although he appealed for the sole purpose of getting a trial in the justice's\u00a0 court, a right which the Code expressly gives him,\u00a0 he is nevertheless denied that right although the appellate court finds that he is entitled to it and that the justice's court erred in denying it.\u00a0 This interpretation of the law is, in my opinion, unsustainable from any point of view.<br\/><br\/>It should be noted that the statute provides that \"either party to an action before a justice of the peace may appeal from the judgment of the justice of the peace to the next regular stated term of the Court of First Instance to be held within the province in which the judgment was rendered in the manner herein provided\" (section 74 of the Code of Civil Procedure); and that \"a perfected appeal shall operate to vacate the judgment of the justice of the peace, and the action when duly entered in the Court of First Instance shall stand for trial <i>de novo<\/i> upon its merits in accordance with the regular procedure in that court, as though the same never had been tried and had been originally there commenced.\"\u00a0 (Section 75, same.)\u00a0 <br\/><br\/>In considering these actions the language must be carefully noted.\u00a0 It is observed, in the first place, that there is no limitation on the appeal granted in section 74.\u00a0 The right to appeal is full and complete and is unrestricted as to the scope thereof or as to the nature of the question to be presented in the appellate court.<br\/><br\/>It must be observed, in the second place, that the language of section 75 restricts its application to <i>new<\/i> trials in the appellate court.\u00a0 It has no reference to an appeal which presents to the appellate court questions of law.\u00a0 The words \"<i>de novo<\/i>\" and \"upon its merits\" and \"as though the same had never been tried,\" all demonstrate\u00a0 conclusively that the appeal referred to in that section is one for a <i>new<\/i> trial.\u00a0 This necessarily presupposes that there has already been a trial in the justice's court because, as a matter of language, there could not be a <i>new<\/i> trial in the appellate court if there had not been an <i>old<\/i> trial in the court below.\u00a0 In other\u00a0 words, the appellate court cannot try a cause <i>de novo<\/i>, that is, <i>again<\/i>, unless the cause has been tried before.<br\/><br\/>The necessary conclusion is, therefore, that section 75 does not apply to appeals from judgments of justices' courts upon questions of law alone.\u00a0 This is not only clear from the language used, but it is also clear from reason.\u00a0 If a plaintiff, as in the present case, goes into a justice's court with a case perfectly cognizable by that court under the law and that court, in the face of the statute which expressly gives the plaintiff the right to be heard in that court in the first instance, arbitrarily and\u00a0 erroneously refuses to hear the cause and summarily dismisses the plaintiff from the court without a hearing, should not such plaintiff have a remedy by which he could compel the justice of the peace to accord him the right thus expressly granted him by statute?\u00a0 It is undoubted that he should; and the appeal given by section 74 is\u00a0 fully adequate to that purpose.\u00a0 But, if the theory of an appeal from a justice's court contended for in these actions is sustained, then such plaintiff, by the very act of\u00a0 appealing, is deprived of his right to have corrected the very error appealed from, for the instant that he arrives at the Court of First Instance on the appeal he is there told that the Court of First Instance has no power to hear any appeal except for a trial of the case upon the merits, that is to say, a trial \"<i>de novo<\/i>,\" and that he cannot, therefore, afford any relief concerning the error alleged and which is the sole basis of the\u00a0 appeal.\u00a0 It is to be observed that the trial in the appellate court\u00a0 on the merits, in the first instance, <i>is the very thing which the statute sought to avoid<\/i> when it gave exclusive original jurisdiction in this class of cases to justices' courts.\u00a0 In giving the justice's court exclusive original jurisdiction of an action for the possession of real estate, the object of the legislature was to avoid the loss of time and the great expense which necessarily follow the trial of cases in the Court of First Instance, and the hardship and even injustice that would naturally result to one who had been illegally deprived of the possession of his lands.\u00a0 The very purpose of the statute was,therefore, to prevent the Court of First Instance from trying the case originally upon the merits.\u00a0 Thus it will be seen that the theory that the only appeal possible from a justice's court is one in which the case must be tried upon the merits in the appellate court accomplishes the very purpose which the statute was designed to avoid.<br\/><br\/>Moreover, this theory prevents the plaintiff whose complaint has been dismissed on demurrer from having decided in the appellate court the only question presented to the justice's court, the only question raised by the appeal and the only question that can possibly be presented to the appellate court.\u00a0 That question is one of law, namely, whether the plaintiff's complaint, upon demurrer, shows that the justice's court had jurisdiction of the action.\u00a0 That is the only question raised in the court below, it is the only question upon which the appeal was taken, and it is the only question that can, in any manner, be touched by the appellate court.\u00a0 An appeal does not give the Court of First Instance the right to make something out of nothing; to draw from nowhere questions that were never presented in the court below, were never passed on by that court, and were never presented to the appellate court.\u00a0 The first principle governing the powers of appellate courts is that they are governed and controlled absolutely by the questions raised in the court below that were passed upon by it, and which are presented by the appeal.<br\/><br\/>Upon the theory which I am criticising the appellate court would not only raise and decide questions not raised in the court below or passed upon by it or presented by the appeal, but it would go further and <i>refuse to hear the only question that was raised in the court below<\/i>, that was\u00a0 passed upon by it, and that was presented on the appeal, namely, the question of law as to whether or not the justice's court had jurisdiction of an action of unlawful detainer.\u00a0 This is clear, for, if the appellate court tries such case upon the merits, it necessarily disregards the question of whether the justice's court had jurisdiction of the action, that question being utterly immaterial.\u00a0 As a necessary result the appellant not only gets a trial in the appellate court, the very thing that he does, not want and the very thing that the statute of unlawful detainer guards against, but, after he has made his laborious way to the appellate court, he is subjected to the further injustice of being told that the court will not consider the only question that he has to present to it.<br\/><br\/>It is clear, therefore, that the plaintiff in the cases at bar had\u00a0 the right to appeal upon question of law alone, that is, as to the legality of the action of the justice of the peace in dismissing the case for lack of jurisdiction; and that, therefore, the only power conferred by that appeal upon the appellate court was to\u00a0 determine that question of law and, when that question was resolved favorably to the appellant, to reverse the judgment sustaining the demurrer and remand the cause for trial upon the merits.<br\/><br\/>In the case of Bennett <i>vs<\/i>. Phelps (12 Minn., 326 [216]) which was an action instituted originally before the justice of the peace for money had and received, the supreme court said:\u00a0 \"The appeal being taken on questions of law only, no question of law can be tried or raised in the district court except those tried or raised in the court below, and to which an exception was taken to the order made thereon by the justice, except objection\u00a0 to the jurisdiction of the court, and that the\u00a0 complaint or answer does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action or defense.\"\u00a0 <br\/><br\/>In the case of State <i>vs<\/i>. King (42 La. Ann., 77), the court said that it could not \"be asked to determine the merits of the controversy in any contingency, when such were not before him on the appeal;\" and that \"in a case of a reversal in a suit like the present one, it could not pass upon the merits of the litigation,\u00a0 for the reason that the merits had not been determined below and would have to remand.\u00a0 In case of affirmance, there would be no merits to determine.\"<br\/><br\/>In the case of Coughran <i>vs<\/i>. Wilson (7 S. D., 155), the action was one before a justice of the peace in which a counterclaim was interposed to a demand for a sum of money.\u00a0 The court gave judgment for plaintiff for the amount found due upon his evidence.\u00a0 The defendant appealed to the county court upon questions of law alone.\u00a0 The county court rendered judgment for defendant for the amount of the counterclaim as pleaded.\u00a0 On appeal to the supreme court it was held that it was not an appeal for a new trial in the appellate court, but only for the review of alleged errors of law occurring at the trial in the justice's court; that on such an appeal it would not try the case itself;\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 that the judgment should have been reversed, and the cause remanded for trial in the justice's court.<br\/><br\/>In the case of People <i>vs<\/i>. Court (10 Cal., 19), it was held that \"the county court can only retry the issues tried in the court below.\u00a0 That is what is meant by a trial anew in the county court, under section six hundred and twenty-six.\"\u00a0 See Fabretti <i>vs<\/i>. Superior Court (77 Cal., 305).<br\/><br\/>Spelling in his Appellate Practice, section 749, states the rule to be that \"where the justice has rendered judgment, without a trial of issues of fact, upon a\u00a0 question of law alone-for instance, by a ruling upon a demurrer, and such ruling was erroneous-the superior court should reverse the judgment and remand the case with directions to the justice's court to overrule the demurrer, with leave to the plaintiff to amend if so advised.\"<br\/><br\/>See Maxon <i>vs<\/i>. Superior Court (124 Cal., 468).<br\/><br\/>In Myrick <i>vs<\/i>. Superior\u00a0 Court (68 Cai., 98), which was a proceeding for a writ of certiorari, it appeared that in the justice's court a motion of defendant to dismiss the action had been granted and judgment in his favor rendered for costs.\u00a0 On appeal the superior court tried the whole case and gave judgment for the plaintiff.\u00a0 The supreme court annulled the judgment upon the ground that there could be no trial of issues of fact in the superior court because there had been none in the justice's court.\u00a0 (Larue <i>vs<\/i>. Gaskins, 5 Cal., 507; Brown <i>vs<\/i>. Superior Court, 72 Cal., 14.)<br\/><br\/>It is undoubted that, in an appeal from a justice's court, whether upon questions of law alone or for a new trial, the decision of the appellate court upon that appeal is final and conclusive unless the validity or constitutionality of a statute or municipal ordinance is involved.\u00a0 Where, however, the appeal is one on the law only and the appellate court refuses to take cognizance of the appeal, but proceeds to try the action upon the merits, thereby exercising not appellate power but original jurisdiction, the prohibition just referred to does not apply.<br\/><br\/>I do not desire to be understood as expressing the opinion that where there has actually been a trial in the justice's court, the defeated party may then appeal on questions of law alone and thus prevent the appellate court from trying the action on the merits.<br\/><br\/>I am of the opinion that the appeal to this court is proper, and I concur in the judgment of this court annulling the judgment of the Court of First Instance and remanding the cause to the justice's court for trial.<br\/><br\/><i>Trent, J., dissents<\/i>. <\/div>",

BASILIO PALENCIA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>ARELLANO, C.J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">On August 23, 1907, Juan Palencia and Basilio Palencia signed a notarial instrument in favor of Eugenio Pardinas, wherein they admitted that they owed the latter the sum of P5,250, promised to pay the debt jointly and severally within three years, with interest at 25 per cent, and, as security for such payment, mortgaged certain property. On December 9, 1907, Pardinas died, and in the division made of his estate among his widow and other heirs, this mortgage fell to his widow, Andrea Salvador.\u00a0 The debt not having been satisfied, with the exception of P673,40, paid as interest, Andrea Salvador brought the present suit, January 31, 1911.\u00a0 These facts are admitted.<br\/><br\/>In the same notarial instrument of August 23, 1907, Juan Palencia and Basilio Palencia obligated themselves, in case of noncompliance with the contract and the institution of a judicial action, to pay all the expenses that might be occasioned Pardinas \"for attorney's fees, court costs, and any loss and damage.\"\u00a0 This fact is also admitted.<br\/><br\/>Andrea Salvador's complaint is directed against Basilio Palencia, for his own share of the indebtedness as weIl as Juan Palencia's, of whose intestate estate he is the duly appointed administrator.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This fact is likewise admitted.<br\/><br\/>The petitions in the complaint are: (1) That the defendant pay <i>in solidum<\/i> the principal debt of P5,250 Philippine currency; (2) that the defendant pay <i>in solidum<\/i> the interest stipulated at the rate of 25 per cent a year, reckoning from August 23, 1907, until date of payment, annually liquidated, with due allowance for the P673.40 paid on account at different times; (3) that he pay <i>in solidum<\/i>, for losses and damages, P100 Philippine currency, and, in addition thereto, 20 per cent of the sum of principal and interest due up to the date of payment of the mortgage, as fees and expenses of the plaintiff's attorney; (4) that, in default of payment of these amounts, the property mortgaged be sold; and (5) that he pay the costs of the suit.<br\/><br\/>The defendant admits the instrument of mortgage, with the exception of the inserted word <i>annual<\/i> which appears therein in connection with the stipulated 25 per cent interest, alleging as a defense that this word was not in the instrument and was subsequently added. The plaintiff admitted this, but asserted that it had been added with the knowledge and consent of the debtors, the Palencias.<br\/><br\/>The main issue raised, even in this appeal, is whether the defendant owed, on his own account and on that of the intestate estate represented by him, an annual interest at 25 per cent, or interest at 25 per cent payable at one time at the maturity of the debt.<br\/><br\/>The Court of First Instance of Albay decided that issue by holding:\u00a0 (1) That the insertion was made subsequent to the execution of the instrument of mortgage, but with the knowledge and consent of the defendant Basilio Palencia, who is liable to the plaintiff for the payment of the.interest demanded at the rate of 25 per cent a year; and (2) that there was not sufficient evidence of record to prove that the deceased Juan Palencia gave his consent to such alteration in the contract, and that his intestate estate should not, therefore, be held liable for payment of interest at the rate of 25 per cent a year.<br\/><br\/>This second conclusion is in no manner impugned in the plaintiff's brief on appeal, whereby it is inferred that she acquiesces in that the intestate estate of Juan Palencia ought to pay only once interest at 25 per cent on the principal of P5,250.<br\/><br\/>The defendant appealed from the first conclusion, for the reason that he had denied at the trial that he consented to such an insertion, and furthermore because the plaintiff was not explicit on this point.\u00a0 However, and although the reason for such conclusion was not set forth in the judgment appealed from, two receipts signed by the plaintiff appear to have been presented in evidence by the defendant (Exhibits 1 and 2), which prove that Juan Palencia, on June 18, 1908, the year after the debt was contracted, paid P313 \"on <i>account<\/i> of the interest <i>due<\/i> on his unpaid bill with this firm,\" and that on September 13, 1009, he likewise paid \"P300 on <i>account<\/i> of the interest <i>due<\/i> on his unpaid debt.\"\u00a0 Said sums for interest due could hardly have been paid during those two years succeeding the date of the contract, if it were not to fall due until the termination of the contract on August 23, 1910.\u00a0 When they paid it on.account in June, 1908, and September, 1909, it must have been due annually, and not only once.\u00a0 The opinion of the trial court as expressed in his second conclusion is, consequently, in accord with sound judgment and with the law of contracts.\u00a0 Consideration of his first conclusion is omitted, since it was not impugned in this appeal.<br\/><br\/>The findings of the judgment on this issue are:\u00a0 That the defendants, Basilio Palencia and the intestate estate of Juan Palencia, pay, jointly and severally, P5,250 Philippine currency; that they pay interest thereon at the rate of 25 per cent, provided that with regard to the share of the intestate estate of Juan Palencia, such interest be computed from August 23, 1907, up to the same date in 1910, and from this last date, at the rate of 6 per cent per annum, until date of payment; and, with respect to Basilio Palencia's share, that the said 25 per cent interest be computed annually from said date of August 23, 1907; and that deduction be made in favor of both defendants of the P673.40 paid on account.<br\/><br\/>The assignment of error made by the plaintiff, in her appeal, is that the trial court did not sentence the defendants to the payment of legal interest on the interest agreed upon and due January 31, 1911, the date when the original complaint in this case was filed.<br\/><br\/>We sustain this assignment of error.\u00a0 \"Interest due shall earn legal interest from the time it is judicially demanded, even if the obligation should have been silent on this point.\"\u00a0 (Civil Code, art. 1109.)<br\/><br\/>In conformity with this provision of the law, the interest of 25 per cent, on the part of Juan Palencia, stipulated by him, as was held by the trial judge, in the manner it appears to have been originally in the notarial instrument, without the addition of the word <i>annual<\/i>, is due only once <i>from<\/i> August 23, 1907, as held in the judgment, and not up to August 23, 1910, but up to.the time of the institution of the action by filing of the complaint, which is when the intestate estate appears to have become delinquent, there being no proof of any extrajudicial demand.\u00a0 (Civil Code, art. 1100.) And from the date of the complaint the total of the interest due at the rate of 25 per cent shall earn 6 per cent interest until the date of its actual payment.<br\/><br\/>In the settlement of Basilio Palencia's debt, he shall be charged the stipulated interest of 25 per cent per annum from August 23, 1907, up to the presentation of the complaint, and from this date the total of this stipulated interest shall draw legal interest at 6 per cent until the date of its actual payment.<br\/><br\/>Another finding of the judgment appealed from is that Basilio Palencia and the intestate estate of Juan Palencia both pay <i>in solidum<\/i> 20 per cent of the principal and respective interest, as fees for the plaintiff's attorney, and also the costs of the case.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff and the defendant have both appealed from this finding of the judgment, the former as insufficient, and the latter as improper because premature.\u00a0 \"Improper and premature,\"says the defendant, \"because it is a penal clause of strict interpretation and until a settlement shall have been had of the expenses incurred, the 20 per cent ought not to be deducted therefrom.\" \"Insufficient,\" alleges the plaintiff, \"because the judgment allows the said 20 per cent only on the principal and respective interest,\" that is, the stipulated, without including the legal, interest.<br\/><br\/>The facts proved are the following: (1) Juan and Basilio Palencia stated in the instrument of August 23, 1907: \"In case of our noncompliance with our previous contract, <i>should<\/i> Pardinas have to resort to the courts of law, all the expenses occasioned him thereby, both attorney's fees and court costs, will be paid by us\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.\"\u00a0 (Exhibit A.)<br\/><br\/>(2) The instrument marked Exhibit C appears to have been executed on November 15, 1910, to this effect:<br\/><blockquote>\"Be it known by these presents:\u00a0 That we, Andrea Salvador, widow of Pardinas, as the party of the first part, * * * and Leoncio Imperial, attorney * * *, as the party of the second part, have stipulated and covenanted a contract of hire of services, under the following conditions: * * * (3) In payment of professional services for the collection of the debt referred to in the preceding paragraphs, whether they terminate in the Court of First Instance of Albay, upon appeal to the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands or by a private and friendly settlement, the creditor, Dona Andrea Salvador, will pay and deliver to the attorney, Leoncio Imperial, a sum equal to twenty per cent (20%) of the total amount, including principal and interest, collected from the debtors; * * * (5) the fees agreed upon shall be paid by Do\u00f1a Andrea Salvador to the attorney, Leoncio Imperial, just as soon as the collection of the debt is effected in any of the ways stated.\"<\/blockquote>In this covenant of <i>quota litis<\/i> between the plaintiff and her attorney, the former is obligated to pay to the latter only what <i>is collected<\/i> from the debtors, including principal and interest, and to pay it as soon as the collection of the debt shall have been made, whether effected judicially, extra-judicially, or by friendly arrangement.\u00a0 Howsoever what the debtors owe be collected, and just as soon as such collection is made, the plaintiff must hand over 20 per cent of the amount she collects and as soon as she collects it.\u00a0 But the defendants, should a friendly and extrajudicial settlement be effected, would not have to pay to the plaintiff the 20 per cent of the amount she might have in such manner collected and paid to her attorney, for they are only obligated to pay 20 per cent of the expenses that might be incurred by collection through the courts.<br\/><br\/>In view of these facts we find:\u00a0 (1) That the complaint in this action was duly drawn up for this 20 per cent stipulated in the contract and is not fundamentally premature; (2) that to the finding of the trial judge, that the defendants must pay the said 20 per cent \"on the principal and respective interest,\" it should be added that such interest means both the stipulated and the <i>legal<\/i>; (3) that it is premature and improper to hold absolutely that the defendants must pay the 20 per cent as fees for the plaintiff's attorney, but only the 20 per cent on what the plaintiff collects, and when she collects it, as expenditures actually made by her for her attorney's fees; for if really the proper finding must be made in the judgment itself with respect to this part of the contract, it ought to be done only in the way stipulated by the parties, to wit, 20 per cent of the expenses for an attorney that might be incurred by bringing suit, and such expenses are to be understood 20 per cent of the sum which the plaintiff might recover in the suit\u2014that is, 20 per cent of what she might collect in the execution of the judgment. If, though the credit on account of principal, stipulated and legal interest, should amount to 15, the plaintiff should recover only 10, or actually in the execution of the judgment should collect only 10, the defendants would be obligated to pay only 20 per cent of 10, and not of 15, which appears to be the way the finding1 to pay 20 per cent of the attorney's fees ought to be understood.<br\/><br\/>We therefore decide that the defendants, Basilio Palencia and the intestate estate of Juan Palencia; shall pay jointly and severally to the plaintiff, Andrea Salvador, P5,250 Philippine currency, as principal, with the interest agreed upon of 25 per cent per annum from the date of the contract to that of the complaint, in so far as regards the liability of Basilio Palencia; and once only,up to the date of the complaint with respect to the liability of the intestate estate of the deceased Juan Palencia, with deduction of P673.40; and furthermore, that the defendants, or either of them, shall pay the 6 per cent legal interest on the total of the interest agreed upon as concerns their liability respectively, from the date of the complaint until its actual and complete payment, as well as 20 per cent of the amount actually expended by the plaintiff as fees for her attorney and the costs of the first instance, no special finding being made as to those of the second; whereby the judgment appealed from is affirmed in so far as it agrees with this decision, and is reversed in so far as it does not.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa, Johnson<\/i>, and <i>Trent, JJ<\/i>., concur. <\/div>",

Ramon has shot father.'\u00a0 I immediately called to my brother and sister, who lived close by, and, accompanied by them and my son Juan, went to the place where my son directed.\u00a0 When we drew near Ramon threatened to shoot us if we approached the place.\u00a0 The moon shone dimly that night.\u00a0 I went to the lieutenant of Constabulary and reported this matter that\u00a0 night.\u00a0 I saw my husband's body the following morning in Capitulan, where it had been taken by a policeman\" (pp. 69-77).<br\/><br\/>Juan Paguirigan, being duly sworn, testified substantially as follows:\u00a0 \"I am 8 years old and live in Anafunan, Cagayan Province.\u00a0 My father's name is Francisco Paguirigan, and mother's name Zoila Aquino.\u00a0 I do not go to school.\u00a0 My father is dead; he was shot by Ramon.\u00a0 My father and Gabina Tuiiao and I had gone to catch frogs, and on our return home Ramon came out of a cornfield and followed along after my father for a little way and then shot him twice with a revolver.\u00a0 The shots were fired in rapid succession.\u00a0 My father was not looking toward Ramon when the latter shot him; they had not spoken to each other that night.\u00a0 After the shots were fired Gabina started to run away and I also ran\" (pp. 77-83).<br\/><br\/>The record shows that the defense objected to the testimony of this witness on the ground that he was not old enough to comprehend the meaning of an oath; but the court, after examining1 the boy, allowed him to testify.\u00a0 A number of questions were asked this\u00a0 witness by the fiscal and the court for the purpose of testing and determining his intelligence, education, and memory.<br\/><br\/>Gabina Tuliao, being duly sworn, testified substantially as follows:\u00a0 \"I am 12 years of age and a resident of Tuguegarao, Cagayan Province.\u00a0 I was acquainted with Francisco Paguirigan; his wife is my aunt.\u00a0 I never accompanied Francisco at any time to catch frogs.\u00a0 Francisco is now dead; they say that he was shot.\u00a0 I was in my house when the shots were fired; our house is about 150 yards from the place where Francisco was killed.\u00a0 I did not go with Francisco and Juan to catch frogs that night, and I do not know of anything that happened except what I was told by Juan\" (pp. 83-87).<br\/><br\/>Mariano Aquino, being duly sworn, testified substantially as follows:\u00a0 \"I am 32 years of age, married, a laborer, and a resident of Tuguegarao, Cagayan Valley.\u00a0 I am acquainted with Francisco Paguirigan and Ramon Buncad; they are both relatives of mine.\u00a0 Francisco is now dead.\u00a0 I live very near the house of Zoila Aquino.\u00a0 On the day before Francisco's death my attention was attracted by loud talking in his\u00a0 house, and I went there to see who was making the noise and found that Ramon and Francisco were quarreling about the purchase price of a pig; Francisco asked P4 for the pig and Ramon wanted to buy it for P2.\u00a0 I was in my house when Francisco was killed; I heard the shots fired.\u00a0 I heard Juan report the death of his father to his mother and saw her weeping.\u00a0 I went with them to the place where Ramon was and he prevented us from approaching, stating that he would kill us if we came there.\u00a0 I reported this matter that night to the lieutenant of Constabulary in Tuguegarao\" (pp. 87-90).<br\/><br\/>Vicente Aquino, being duly sworn, testified substantially as follows:\u00a0 \"I am 33 years of age, married, a laborer, and live in Anafunan, Cagayan Province.\u00a0 I live with Zoila Aquino, the widow of Francisco Paguirigan.\u00a0 On the day before Francisco's death I heard a commotion in his house and went in there, and found Francisco and Ramon quarreling.\u00a0 They were disputing about the price of a pig which Ramon wished to buy from Francisco.\u00a0 I was in my house on the night that Francisco was killed; I heard the shots fired.\u00a0 Zoila called to me after I heard the shots\" (pp. 91-93).<br\/><br\/>R. H.\u00a0 Rissler, being duly Sworn, testified substantially as follows: \"I am 29 years of age, married, a native of the United States, and am serving as district health officer in Tuguegarao.\u00a0 The document marked Exhibit A was written by me, and is a report of an autopsy made in the case of a Filipino whose body was brought here from Anafunan during the first days of August.\u00a0 From the examination made of the body I am of the opinion that the assailant was standing to the right and a little in front when he fired the first shot, and that the deceased had his back toward him when the second shot was fired.\u00a0 One of the shots, undoubtedly the latter, completely severed the large arteries, and the deceased must have fallen immediately.\u00a0 The shots were fired at close range, in my opinion within 2 to 4 feet of the deceased, as there were powder burns on both wounds\" (pp. 93-96).<br\/><br\/>Mariano Mapagu, being duly sworn, testified substantially as follows:\u00a0 \"I am 24 years of age, a Constabulary soldier, and a resident of Tuguegarao, Cagayan Province,\u00a0 On August 5, 1911, Lieutenant Me Adams asked me to accompany him to make an investigation in regard to the killing of Francisco Paguirigan of the barrio of Anafunan.\u00a0 Lieutenant Me Adams talked with the wife of Francisco Paguirigan and her son through me as interpreter.\u00a0 The boy stated to Lieutenant McAdams that they had gone to catch frogs on that night; that while his father was catching frogs he saw Ramon Buncad come from the cornfield walking in a stooping position; and that Ramon went between them and shot his father\" (pp. 96-97).<br\/><br\/>Carlos Maguigad, being duly sworn, testified substantially as follows:\u00a0 \"I am 44 years of age and am serving as municipal president of Tuguegarao.\u00a0 I am acquainted with the defendant; he was formerly a municipal policeman.\u00a0 He was serving as a policeman in the barrio of Anafunan in the month of\u00a0 August, 1911.\u00a0 The policemen here are all armed with revolvers, and Ramon Buncad had a revolver on August 4, 1911, as he was then on duty.\u00a0 The revolver he had is now in the police department.\u00a0 On the night of the occurrence policemen were sent to arrest the defendant, and early the following morning they brought the defendant and the body of the deceased to the municipal building.\u00a0 The policemen found the defendant in the same place where the dead body was found\" (pp. 97-99).<br\/><br\/>Ramon Valdez, being duly sworn, testified substantially as follows: \"I am 34 years of age, married, and am serving as justice of the peace of Tuguegarao.\u00a0 Some time ago I informed this court verbally that certain effects had been placed in my possession as the result of a preliminary investigation held in this case.\u00a0 Two hens, a rice sack, and a piece of rope were delivered to me by the\u00a0 municipal police, who stated that they found these effects\u00a0 at the place where the body of the deceased lay.\u00a0 I held the preliminary investigation in this case.\u00a0 When arraigned before me the defendant entered a plea of not guilty\" (pp. 100-101).<br\/><br\/>Luis Taguinod, being duly sworn, testified substantially as follows:\u00a0 \"I am serving as a municipal policeman of Tuguegarao.\u00a0 On August 4,1911, I was sent by the municipal president to investigate the killing of Francisco\u00a0 Paguirigan and made a report to him upon\u00a0 the case.\u00a0 I went to the place where the body lay at about 11 o'clock at night; I found the defendant there.\u00a0 The defendant told me that he was holding the deceased, but that in spite of this the deceased turned against him in the attitude of striking him.\u00a0 I found a sack, a rope, and a bolo by the body of the deceased\" (pp. 101-102).<br\/><br\/>The defense introduced no evidence.<br\/><br\/>The trial court found the defendant guilty as charged in the information, that there were several aggravating circumstances and no mitigating circumstances in the commission of the crime, and sentenced him to suffer the death penalty, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of P1,000, and to pay the costs.<br\/><br\/>The appellant claims that the lower court erred (1) in giving credit to the declarations of the child Juan Paguirigan, the only eyewitness that testified for the prosecution; (2) in not acquitting the defendant, or at any rate finding him guilty only of the crime of homicide.<br\/><br\/>The appellant's principal contention is that the testimony of the witness Juan Paguirigan is unreliable because of his tender age.\u00a0 The boy's age is given at 8 years.\u00a0 The law in this jurisdiction does not disqualify any person for serving as a witness on account of age; and there is no presumption of incapacity at 8 years of age.\u00a0 Section 55 of General Orders, No. 58, and section 382 of the Code of Civil Procedure provide that all persons, without exception, who having organs of sense, can perceive, and perceiving can make known their perceptions to others, may be witnesses.<br\/><br\/>Professor Wigmore, after referring to the common-law precedents upon this point, says: \"But this much may be taken as settled, that no rule defines <i>any particular age<\/i> as conclusive of incapacity; in each instance the capacity of the particular child is to be investigated.\"\u00a0 (Wigmore on Evidence, Vol. I, p. 638.)<br\/><br\/>In the case of Wheeler <i>vs<\/i>. United States (159 XL S., 523), the Supreme Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Brewer, said:\u00a0 \"The decision of this question rests primarily with the trial judge, who sees the proposed witness, notices his manner, his apparent possession or lack of intelligence, and may resort to any\u00a0 examination which will tend to disclose his capacity and intelligence as well as his understanding of the obligations of an oath.\u00a0 As many of these matters cannot be photographed into the record, the decision of the trial judge will not be\u00a0 disturbed on review unless from that which is preserved it is clear that it was erroneous.\"<br\/><br\/>In speaking of the witness, Juan Paguirigan, the trial court said: \"A serious effort was made by the defense to discredit the evidence of the witness Juan Paguirigan, who was only 8 years old, but after careful examination of the mental capacity of this witness the court finds it to be a fact that this small boy is an unusually intelligent child for his age, gave his evidence in a straightforward and unembarrassed\u00a0 manner, and was on the whole as satisfactory as about half the witnesses that appear in this court.\u00a0 In addition to this, the fact is that this child told almost identically the\u00a0 same story early in the morning following the homicide, at which time, owing to the excitement prevailing at such a time and owing to the absence of the elder members of his family, it is extremely improbable that this child could have been taught the story which he told upon the stand in this case.\"<br\/><br\/>A review of the testimony of this boy, as it appears of record, discloses nothing which would justify us in holding that the trial judge erred in arriving at his conclusions as to the ability of the lad to testify intelligently.\u00a0 Counsel for appellant undertook to discredit the testimony of the boy by an attempt to ascribe his ability to tell the story of the killing of his father in the form and manner in which it appears in the record to hypnosis.\u00a0 But there is not a shred of evidence in the record in support of this theory of the defense, and if the contention of counsel as to the possibility that the testimony of this witness may have been procured or influenced by hypnotic suggestion should be deemed of sufficient force to raise a reasonable doubt as to his credibility, no reason appears why like contentions should not put in doubt the truth and accuracy of the testimony of any and every witness called to testify in a judicial proceeding.<br\/><br\/>We think the evidence of record conclusively establishes the allegations of the information except as to the existence of <i>premeditacion conocida<\/i> (deliberate premeditation).<br\/><br\/>There is no evidence in the record which discloses when or where the accused first made up his mind to take the life of the deceased.\u00a0 There is evidence of a squabble between them the day before the murder, but there is nothing to show that the accused made up his mind to kill the deceased at that time.\u00a0 The mere fact that he did kill him on the night of the day following is not sufficient ground to justify that inference.\u00a0 The killing may have\u00a0 been the direct outcome of the quarrel.\u00a0 We do not know as to that.\u00a0 But something may have occurred, and we are inclined to think did occur,\u00a0 between the time of the quarrel and the murder which inflamed the anger of the accused to the point of resolving to kill his adversary.\u00a0 The\u00a0 quarrel may have been renewed during the progress of the frog-hunt, before the deceased and his son set out for home, for it does not appear from the record whether the accused did or did not meet the deceased on the night of the crime before the time when he attacked and killed him.\u00a0 It is absolutely impossible, therefore, for us to determine that the period of time which elapsed between the time when the accused resolved to commit the crime and the moment of its commission was, in the language of a former decision, \"sufficient in a judicial sense to afford a full opportunity for meditation and reflection, and sufficient to allow the conscience of the actor to overcome the resolution of his will if he desired to hearken to its warnings.\"\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Gil, 13 Phil, Rep., 530.)<br\/><br\/>While this court has never undertaken to fix any definite period of time, the lapse of which between the taking of the resolution to commit a crime and its commission would justify the inference that the crime when committed, was committed with deliberate premeditation (<i>premeditacion conocida<\/i>), nevertheless such an\u00a0 inference has never been sustained in the absence of proof of the lapse of a substantial interval of time clearly sufficient to bring the case within the above-cited rule laid down in the case of United States <i>vs<\/i>. Gil.\u00a0 The mere fact that it appears that the accused was lying in wait for his victim just before the attack is not sufficient, in itself, to sustain a finding of deliberate premeditation, in the absence of proof that he had been lying in wait for a substantial period of time.\u00a0 In the case of United States <i>vs<\/i>. Mercoleta (17\u00a0 Phil. Rep., 317), wherein proof that the defendant lay in wait for his victim was held sufficient to establish\u00a0 the existence of deliberate premeditation, it was shown that the accused borrowed a bolo for the purpose of committing the crime early in the morning and was lying in wait for some time before he attacked his victim.\u00a0 In the case at bar, it is impossible to say how long the accused may have been lying in wait,\u00a0 There is nothing in the record which would justify\u00a0 us in holding that he did not step into the undergrowth where he was hiding a few minutes or even seconds before his\u00a0 victim passed by; or that he had not had a quarrel with his\u00a0 victim a few minutes before the attack, and then and there having resolved to kill him, went at once to the place of ambush.<br\/><br\/>We are of opinion that the record does not disclose any qualifying\u00a0 or aggravating circumstances marking the unlawful killing of the deceased other than that of <i>alevosia<\/i> (treachery)\u2014the fact that the attack was made at night constituting, under the circumstances of this case, one of the elements which must be taken into consideration in holding that it was made <i>con alevosia<\/i> (with treachery).\u00a0 The penalty which should therefore have been imposed is the medium degree of that prescribed for the\u00a0 crime of <i>asesinato<\/i> (murder).<br\/><br\/>The sentence imposed by the trial court should therefore be modified by substituting the penalty of <i>cadena perpetua<\/i> (life imprisonment), together with the accessory penalties prescribed by law, for so much thereof as imposes the penalty of death,' and thus modified the penalty imposed by the trial court should be and is hereby affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Osorio, 7 Phil. Rep., 405; Marzon\u00a0 vs. Udtujan, 20 Phil. Rep,, 232.)\u00a0 The defense of prescription was duly raised by the answer.<br\/><br\/>The next assigned error is to the effect that the court should have held that the right of action had prescribed.\u00a0 the written contract did not include the express stipulation that the defendant should have the privilege of leasing a portion of the premises to other persons and applying the income thereby obtained to the redemption price, nor can such a privilege be inferred from the language of the contract.\u00a0 The oral agreement was therefore a new and independent contract, entirely distinct from the former, written contract, and no part of it.\u00a0 It was an oral contract as distinguished from the\u00a0 written contract by which the house was sold and rent was collected from the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>Section 43 of the Code of Civil Procedure reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"Civil actions other than for the recovery of real property can only be brought within the following periods after the right of action accrues:\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>\"2. Within six years:\u00a0 An action upon a contract not in writing, whether such contract is express or implied, and an action upon a liability created by statute other than a forfeiture or penalty.\"<\/blockquote>The present action falls within paragraph 2 of section 43.<br\/><br\/>That plaintiff's right of action accrued at least on December 16, 1902, is conceded.\u00a0 She brought this action on November 15, 1909.\u00a0 The court found as a fact that a verbal demand had been made upon the defendant for the settlement of her claim against him in the latter part of 1905 or the first\u00a0 part of 1906.<br\/><br\/>Article 1973 of the Civil Code reads:\u00a0 \"Prescription of actions is interrupted by their institution before the courts, by extrajudicial claim of the creditor, and by any act of acknowledgment of the debt by the debtor.\"<br\/><br\/>The court held that this article was in force and applicable to the case, and that therefore her verbal demand in 1905 or 1906 had renewed her right of action for another period of six years in accordance with section 43, <i>supra<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>Section 50 of the Code of Civil Procedure reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"<i>What shall renew right of action<\/i>.\u2014When payment has been made upon any demand founded upon contract, or a written acknowledgment thereof or a promise to pay the same has been made and signed by the party sought to be charged, an action may be brought thereon within the time herein limited, after such payment, acknowledgment, or promise.\"<\/blockquote>It was insisted by the defendant that section 50 has repealed article 1973, and that therefore the verbal demand addressed to him in 1905 or 1906 was not sufficient to interrupt the running of the prescription\u00a0 period.\u00a0 In deciding adversely to this contention, the lower court held that section 50 can only <i>renew<\/i> the right of action, and that therefore it cannot apply until after the prescription period has expired.\u00a0 Further, that it did not provide for the interruption of the prescription period by the\u00a0 the institution of an action, and that payment as provided for in the said section does not cause the interruption of the prescription period but extinguishes the obligation entirely.\u00a0 To this last objection it is sufficient to say that \"payment\" as used in section 50 refers to a partial payment and not to full or final payment.<br\/><br\/>It is incorrect to conclude that the efficacy of section 50 depends upon the expiration of the time within which the action could\u00a0 originally have been brought under the statute.\u00a0 When the debtor has performed any of the acts mentioned in section 50, an action may be brought \"within the time herein limited.\"\u00a0 The quoted phrase refers to the time specified by the various sections of Chapter III, devoted exclusively to the limitation of actions.\u00a0 The section does not state that these acts of the debtor must occur subsequent\u00a0 to the expiration of the original period of prescription.\u00a0 In short, it specifies no time within which these acts of the debtor must occur.\u00a0 It simply says that whenever the debtor has performed any of them, an action may be brought within the time \"herein limited.\"\u00a0 In other words, any one of these acts on the part of the debtor will cause the period to commence to run from the date upon which they were performed in the same manner and for the same length of time as though the right of action had originally accrued on that date.\u00a0 We can do no better than to quote from Wood on Limitations (3d ed.), section 64:<br\/><blockquote>\"The statute of James, which is the foundation of all of our statutes of limitations, and which is virtually in force in several of the States, and practically in all of them with some exceptions, contained no exception in case of acknowledgments of indebtedness by the debtor, yet at an early day such an exception was read into the statute by the judges, and there is no instance of judicial legislation that is better sustained by both reason and justice than this.\u00a0 The true reason for these exceptions is that the reason for a statutory bar utterly fails when a debtor from time to time admits the existence and justice of the debt, and the courts, without intending to thwart, but rather to give effect to, the true intention of the statutes, began at an early day to hold that where a debtor expressly promises to pay a pre-existing debt, or acknowledges its existence under such circumstances that a promise to pay it can be implied, <i>the statute is suspended up to that date, and begins to run anew from the date of such new promise or acknowledgment.<\/i> In other words, that under the circumstances named the debt is revived and put on foot for a new period of life, coextensive with the statutory provision.\"<\/blockquote>While it may be true that, strictly speaking, section 50 \"interrupts\" the running of the statute if the incidents which it specifies occur before the expiration of the original limitation, and \"renews\" the period of limitation when such incidents occur after the expiration of the original limitation, in either case the time within which the action may be brought is extended over a period of the same length as the original grant, computed from the date such incidents occur.\u00a0 This is the important point, and not whether the statute of limitations is interrupted or renewed by it.<br\/><br\/>It is true that section 50 does not provide that the institution of legal proceedings by the creditor shall interrupt or renew the running of the prescription period, while article 1973 of the Civil Code does so provide.\u00a0 But section 50 does not require that the action must be terminated within the period specified.\u00a0 It will be noted that the phrase used in section 39 is, \"civil actions can only be commenced within *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *,\" while in sections 40, 42, 43, and 44, the word \"brought\" is used.\u00a0 If it were true that the bringing of an action did not interrupt the statute, the plaintiff's\u00a0 claim would be barred unless final judgment had been pronounced before the expiration of the period, and it would often follow that a court having jurisdiction over an action at its inception would lose it during the time the case was pending.\u00a0 It would be most difficult for the plaintiff to determine whether it were advisable for him to bring the action because he could not certainly ascertain whether there was sufficient time left to complete it.\u00a0 Practically, this would shorten the time allowed claimants for securing judicial redress to an indefinite extent.\u00a0 It would offer a strong inducement to the defendant to adopt dilatory tactics which would otherwise be of no benefit to him.\u00a0 It cannot be presumed that the Legislature intended the section to produce any such confusion and uncertainty.\u00a0 What Chapter III of the Code of Civil Procedure really provides is that a claim is not barred by its provisions until the specified number of years after the right of action accrues has elapsed.\u00a0 It interposes a definite period, which can not be varied by either party or by the court, between the origin and the extinguishment of defendant's liability.\u00a0 But it is a rule so well known as to require no comment that under the statute of James and its descendants, the institution of an action at once stops the running of the prescription period.\u00a0 So that the effect of instituting an action under section 50 is the same as the institution of an action under article 1973; i e., it interrupts or suspends the operation of the statute and allows the creditor to prosecute his claim judicially and secure final judgment in the matter, even though this is rendered subsequent to the expiration of the prescription period.\u00a0 The argument, therefore, that section 50 does not provide for the interruption of the running of the statute by the institution of legal proceedings is without foundation.<br\/><br\/>The real differences between section 50 and article 1973 are:\u00a0 (1) Article 1973 provides that prescription is interrupted by an extrajudicial claim of the creditor, while section 50 does not; and (2) that article 1973 permits the interruption of the prescription period by <i>any<\/i> act of acknowledgment of the debt by the debtor, while section 50 restricts such acts to (<i>a<\/i>) a payment on the debt, or (<i>b<\/i>) a written acknowledgment of it, or (<i>c<\/i>) a written promise to pay signed by the debtor.\u00a0 It is clear, therefore, that under section 50, a verbal demand by the creditor does not suspend the operation of the statute, and that a verbal acknowledgment or promise to pay it not a sufficient acknowledgment of the debt to renew the prescription period.<br\/><br\/>Article 1973 not only includes all of the causes which, under section 50, will renew the right of action, but also provides that many other possible acts of lesser import on the part of the debtor will produce this result.<br\/><br\/>Section 39 of the Code of Civil Procedure reads:\u00a0 \"Civil actions can <i>only<\/i> be commenced within the periods prescribed in <i>this<\/i> chapter after the cause of action accrues; but where a different limitation is prescribed by <i>this<\/i> code, that shall govern.\"<br\/><br\/>It is evident that according to this article, the different periods of prescription applicable to the various civil actions must be found in the Code of Civil Procedure.\u00a0 Those articles of the Civil Code (arts. 1961 to 1968, inclusive) which deal with this subject are therefore repealed, and if article 1973, which is intended to mitigate the rigorousness of prescription when certain circumstances exist, is to have any effect, it must be held applicable to the said provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u00a0 As section 50 of that code serves the same purpose, we would then have two provisions of law applicable on this\u00a0 point.<br\/><br\/>It seems clear that Chapter III of the Code of Civil Procedure was intended by the Legislature to constitute the conplete law on the subject of prescription of civil actions, except, possibly, in certain special cases.\u00a0 We have been furnished with no valid reason, nor can we conceive of any, for applying the supplementary provisions of the Civil Code on this subject to the law as set forth in the Code of Civil Procedure.\u00a0 Nor, had it been the intention that article 1973 should apply to the provisions of the last named code, would it have been necessary to enact section 50, since as shown above, all of this section and something more is included within article 1973.<br\/><br\/>The increased rigorousness of the law of prescription resulting from the repeal of article 1973 and the enactment in its stead of section 50 was a matter of legislative concern. That\u00a0 section was taken from the Code of Ohio (sec. 4992), and similar provisions are found in some other jurisdictions.\u00a0 (Frellsen &amp; Stevenson <i>vs<\/i>. Gantt, 25 La. Ann., 476; Pierce vs. Seymour, 52 Wis., 272; George W. Helm Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Griffin, 112 N. C., 356; Pollack <i>vs<\/i>. Billing, 131 Ala., 519, 32 S., 639.)<br\/><br\/>We therefore hold that article 1973 of the Civil Code is no longer in effect, and that section 50 of the Code of Civil Procedure contains\u00a0 the law applicable to the present case.\u00a0 A verbal demand on the debtor not being sufficient, under section 50, to renew the prescription period, it follows that the time within which the present action could have been brought expired by operation of law, prior to the institution of this action.\u00a0 It is therefore barred by section 43, quoted <i>supra<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the lower court is reversed and the defendant absolved from the demand.\u00a0 In so far as that judgment absolves the plaintiff from the demand for affirmative relief, it is affirmed upon the facts as found by the trial court.\u00a0 No costs will be allowed in this instance.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Johnson<\/i>, and <i>Carson, JJ<\/i>., concur. <\/div>",

KNIGHT, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>CARSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Manila convicting the defendant and appellant of reckless negligence resulting in homicide.<br\/><br\/>The information alleges:\u00a0 \"That on or about the 13th day of September, 1912, in the city of Manila, Philippine Islands, the said E. M. Knight, being then and there a chauffeur driving automobile\u00a0 truck No. 774, as registered by the Bureau of Public Works, and No. 4 of the quartermaster department, through Calle Isaac Peral of this city, willfully, unlawfully, with reckless imprudence, and in violation of regulations, conducted and drove said automobile truck at a greater speed than was reasonable and proper, without regard to the state of traffic and other conditions of the said street and of the atmosphere and weather, and without sounding a horn or ringing a bell, or attracting in any other way the attention of the passers-by, or keeping to the left-hand side of the road, according to the direction he was going, thereby permitting the said auto truck, through his inexcusable recklessness and carelessness, as aforesaid, to run over one Jose Prestuosa, fracturing his skull and thereby causing his instantaneous death; that if the acts committed by the defendant had been done with malice, he would have been guilty of the grave crime of homicide:\u00a0 contrary to law.\"<br\/><br\/>The trial court found the defendant guilty of reckless negligence resulting in homicide as defined and penalized in article 568 of the Penal Code, and sentenced him to one year and one day of <i>prision correccional<\/i>, to pay an indemnity in the sum of p500 to the heirs of the deceased, and to the payment of the costs.<br\/><br\/>The undisputed facts as developed by the evidence of record may be briefly summarized as follows: About 3.30 in the afternoon of the 13th of September, 1912, the defendant, a chauffeur in the employ of the quartermaster's department of the United States Army, was proceeding in\u00a0 charge of a heavily loaded automobile truck along Calle Isaac Peral toward the bay.\u00a0 Except for a steam road roller, which was slowly making its way in the same direction, in advance of the truck, the street was wholly unoccupied at that time.\u00a0 Just as the truck was passing the slow-moving road roller, a boy about 10 or 12 years of age jumped from the step or sideboard of the road roller directly in front of the truck, was knocked down, run over, and instantly killed.<br\/><br\/>Giving the accused the benefit of any doubt which might arise upon a review of all the testimony, it further appears that while the truck was still a considerable way behind the road roller, the boy, who had been running alongside the road roller, jumped on the step or sideboard to take a ride; that the truck was running at the rate of about 8 miles an hour as it came up with the road roller; that at a distance of about 45 or 50 feet from the road roller, and while on or approaching a small bridge near the Columbia Club, the defendant sounded his horn twice and then began to turn to the right in order to pass the road roller, which was on the left side of the street; that at that point the street was about 14 meters wide, and that except for the road roller and those riding upon it the street was wholly unoccupied and clear of all obstruction.<br\/><br\/>Basing our conclusions on these facts we agree with the Solicitor-General that the prosecution failed to establish its charge of reckless negligence.<br\/><br\/>In reviewing\u00a0 the conduct of the defendant, in order to determine whether or not he was recklessly negligent on the occasion when the accident occurred, it will be well to have in mind the following sections of Act No. 2159, which quite clearly prescribe the course which it was his duty to pursue under all the circumstances.<br\/><blockquote>\"SEC. 24.\u00a0 No person shall operate a motor vehicle on any highway in\u00a0 these Islands recklessly or at a rate of speed greater than is reasonable and proper, having regard to the width, traffic, grades, crossings, curvatures, and other conditions of the highway and to the conditions of the atmosphere and weather, or so as to endanger the property or the safety or rights, of any person or so\u00a0 as to cause excessive or unreasonable damage to the highway.<br\/><br\/>\"No person shall unreasonably obstruct or impede the passage or right of travel of any motor vehicle or operator thereof and no operator shall unreasonably obstruct the passage of any other vehicle or person on any highway.\u00a0 Every person found guilty of violating the provisions of this section shall be punished by a fine of not less than five nor more than fifty pesos or by imprisonment of not more than six months or by both such fine and imprisonment.<br\/><br\/>\"SEC. 25.\u00a0 Every person operating a motor vehicle on a highway shall turn to the left when meeting persons or vehicles coming toward him, and to the right when overtaking persons or vehicles going in the same direction, unless a different course of action is required in the interests of the safety and security of life, person, or property.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"SEC. 31.\u00a0 When meeting or overtaking\u00a0 persons or vehicles every operator of a motor vehicle shall give timely notice and warning of his proximity by sounding his horn.\u00a0 Such warning should be sounded when the operator, having regard to the speed at which he is traveling, is still a safe distance from the person or vehicle about to be met or overtaken and before the motor vehicle has drawn opposite to or abreast of such person or vehicle, the intent of this provision being the requirement of a warning within such a distance that the same will be clearly heard and not within such a short distance that, owing to its nearness and suddenness, it is likely\u00a0 to cause fright or to startle the person, horse, or other animal which is being met or overtaken.\"<\/blockquote>As\u00a0 pointed\u00a0 out by counsel for the appellant, in his very interesting brief, the charge of reckless negligence in this case cannot be sustained unless the evidence be deemed sufficient to establish either that the accident was due to the fact that, when it occurred, defendant was on the wrong side of the street; or that,he was running at an excessive speed; or that he had failed to give timely notice of his approach to those who were riding on the road roller by sounding his horn.<br\/><br\/>As to the contention that defendant was on the wrong side of the street when the accident occurred, it is sufficient to say that On the broad unobstructed street, wholly unoccupied except for the slow-moving road roller, he was clearly within his rights in attempting to pass to the right, as the evidence shows, that he did; and indeed, it will be seen that in doing so he was\u00a0 proceeding strictly in conformity with the provisions of section 25 of Act No. 2159, above cited.<br\/><blockquote>\"One person is not compelled to travel behind another on the highway, and one has not the exclusive right to precede another.\u00a0 The traveler may pass to the front when he can do so in safety.\"\u00a0 (Clifford <i>vs<\/i>. Tyman, 61 N. H., 508, 510; Law of Automobiles, Berry, 113.)<\/blockquote>The contention as to the alleged excessive speed at which the accused was running and his failure to give timely warning of his intention to pass would seem to be sufficiently disposed of by our findings that, at the time of the accident, he was running at the rate of about 8 miles an hour, and that he blew his horn twice at a distance of between 45 and 50 feet from the road roller.\u00a0 There is some conflict in the record upon these points, but we think that the clear weight of the evidence sustains our findings in this regard, and the Solicitor-General practically concedes both these contentions to the defendant.\u00a0 Certain it is that the evidence does not sustain findings to the contrary beyond a reasonable doubt, and this being a criminal prosecution, the benefit of any doubts which may arise from an examination of the testimony should be given to the accused.<br\/><br\/>In the absence of some exceptional circumstance, a speed of 8 miles an hour maintained by an automobile or automobile truck on a wide, unobstructed, and unoccupied street, in broad daylight, cannot be said to be excessive; and the accused haying sounded his horn twice before he came up with the road roller, and before he turned out in the road in the attempt to pass, must be held to have complied with the regulations in that regard.\u00a0 (See section 31 of Act No. 2159, above cited.)<br\/><br\/>The Solicitor-General in concluding his brief recommends that the judgment of the lower court be reversed, but that the appellant be convicted of the offense defined and penalized in the second paragraph of article 568 of the Penal Code.\u00a0 In support of this contention he says:<br\/><blockquote>\"The first paragraph of article 568\u00a0 under which the defendant was sentenced reads thus:\u00a0 'Any person who by reckless imprudence\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.'\u00a0 From the evidence it is plain that the defendant was not guilty of 'reckless imprudence,' and should not have been sentenced under that paragraph.\u00a0 It seems certain, however, that the defendant has violated section 24 of Act No. 2159, in that he operated his motor\u00a0 vehicle in such a way as to endanger life and cause the death of Jose Prestuosa, and should have been punished according to the second paragraph of article 568 of the Penal Code, which reads:<br\/><br\/>\" 'Any person who, while violating any regulation, shall, by any act of imprudence or negligence not amounting to reckless imprudence, commit an offense, shall suffer the penalty of <i>arresto mayor<\/i> in its medium and maximum degrees \"<\/blockquote>The Solicitor-General's argument would seem to be that proof that a fatal automobile accident occurred is conclusive proof of a violation of the above cited section 24 of\u00a0 Act No. 2159, and that while the defendant was not shown to be guilty of reckless negligence he was guilty of negligence not amounting to reckless negligence in two respects: <br\/><blockquote>\"First, in passing a playing boy at a speed, which, however slow it may have been, was still too fast to avoid the accident; and, second, granting that the horn was blown at a distance of 40 or 50 feet from the boy, the defendant was negligent in not continuing to sound the horn until he had passed the child.\"<\/blockquote>We cannot agree with the Solicitor-General in these contentions.\u00a0 They\u00a0 would seem, in their last analysis, to rest on the theory that when\u00a0 one is injured or killed by an automobile it may always be presumed that there was some negligence on the\u00a0 part of the chauffeur and a violation of the above cited section 24 of Act No. 2159, prohibiting the operation of a motor vehicle on any highway recklessly or so as to endanger the property or the safety or rights of any person.\u00a0 Stated in this form the contention is manifestly untenable.\u00a0 Automobile accidents may happen and do happen for which the persons operating the machines are in no wise responsible.\u00a0 In the case of United States <i>vs<\/i>. Tayongtong (21\u00a0 Phil. Rep., 476), wherein we reversed a judgment of conviction of a chauffeur charged with reckless negligence in running down and killing a foot passenger, we said that:<br\/><blockquote>\"*\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 Where death is due to the negligence of the decedent himself and not to the negligence of the driver of the automobile, the latter cannot be held for homicide.\u00a0 In this case the death of the deceased was due entirely to his own negligence.\u00a0 There\u00a0 is not sufficient reliable proof in the record to establish negligence on the part of the accused.\u00a0 There being no negligence, he is not responsible, no matter what the result of the accident may have been.\"<\/blockquote>So, in the case of United States <i>vs<\/i>. Bacho (10 Phil. Rep., 574), we said:\u00a0 \"*\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 In the general experience of mankind, accidents apparently unavoidable and often inexplicable are unfortunately too frequent to permit us to conclude that some one must be criminally liable for negligence in every case where an accident occurs.\u00a0 It is the duty of the prosecution in each case to prove by competent evidence not only the existence of criminal negligence, but that the accused was guilty thereof.\"<br\/><br\/>In support of his claim that there was some negligence on the part of the defendant and that his conduct amounted to a violation of Act No. 2159, the Solicitor-General contends that while \"a prudent man under the same conditions might not have taken any greater precaution\" than did the defendant, nevertheless the defendant was negligent in that he did not take extraordinary precautions when he saw the boy riding on the road roller.\u00a0 The Solicitor-General insists that he should have reduced his speed lower than the comparatively slow rate of 8 miles an hour at which he was running, and that he should have continued to sound his horn from the moment he saw the boy until he passed him.<br\/><br\/>We think, however, that we would not be justified in holding the drivers of motor vehicles to such extraordinary precautions.<br\/><blockquote>\"The employment of an automobile on the highway as a means of transportation is a lawful use of the road, and if it results in an injury to one traveling by another mode the driver of the automobile cannot be held liable for injury, unless it is made to appear that he used the machine at a time, or in a manner, or under circumstances inconsistent with a proper regard for the rights of others.\"\u00a0 (Mclntyre <i>vs<\/i>. Ames (Ind.), 8-1087.)<\/blockquote>So long as motor vehicles are not used at a time or in a manner or under circumstances inconsistent with the rights of others, or in violation of the regulations, their owners are entitled to all the advantages afforded by a commodious and speedy means of transportation.\u00a0 While those who undertake to drive high-power motor vehicles over the public highways may be, and should be required to exercise great care and skill in the management and control of their machines, so as to avoid inflicting injury upon others, still, they should not be required to exercise such extraordinary precautions as would be necessary to avoid all possibility that others may be injured in person or property as a result if their own negligence or of unforeseen contingencies which a prudent and skillful driver could not be expected to anticipate and provide against.<br\/><br\/>It is true that the statute penalizes the operation of a motor vehicle recklessly or at an excessive rate of speed, \"or so as to endanger the property or safety or rights of any person;\" but this does not mean that in any case where an accident occurs it can be presumed that there was a violation of the provisions of the statute.\u00a0 If it appears that the machine was being operated carefully, prudently, and skillfully at the time when the accident\u00a0 occurred, having regard to all the surrounding circumstances, it cannot fairly be said to have been operated \"so as to endanger the property, safety, or rights of any person.\"\u00a0 Whatever may have been the cause of the accident, if it cannot be attributed to the misconduct or the negligence of the operator in the management of the machine, he cannot be held liable either civilly or criminally.\u00a0 To hold otherwise would be to place an intolerable burden on the use and enjoyment of a class of vehicles of known and admitted utility, and would be a violation of the sound legal principles on which the doctrine of criminal liability as well as that of civil liability for personal injuries have their basis.<br\/><br\/>Had the lad who was run over and\u00a0 killed been a little child below \"the age of understanding,\" or as it is sometimes expressed \"below the thinking age,\" there would be much ground for the contention of the Solicitor-General that the accused was guilty of a violation of the ordinance; indeed, under the doctrine laid down in United States <i>vs.<\/i> Glemente (24\u00a0 Phil. Rep., 178), there can be little doubt that had the lad been a child under the age of understanding, the failure of the\u00a0 accused to have the truck under such\u00a0 perfect control that the accident could have been avoided would have rendered him subject to conviction of the crime of homicide by reckless negligence with\u00a0 which he was charged.\u00a0 In that case we said, in the language of the syllabus prepared by the writer of the opinion:<br\/><blockquote><i>\"Duty of all drivers of vehicles and street cars; children in the streets<\/i>.\u2014It is the duty of any person driving a vehicle, and especially a street car, in the\u00a0 public thoroughfares to reduce the\u00a0 same to control ready to be stopped at any moment if he sees a child below the age of understanding in such a place that it can,\u00a0 by any reasonable chance, place itself in a dangerous\u00a0 position with respect\u00a0 to the vehicle.\u00a0 In such case the vehicle must be under such control that, if the child, by some sudden or unusual movement, places itself in the way of the vehicle, it can be stopped in time to avert injury.<br\/><br\/>\"Vehicles are not permitted to be driven in the public streets in such a way as to endanger the life of a child below the thinking age who may have strayed upon the streets in search of its mother or who may be there, for any other purpose; the child having no judgment of its own, the drivers of vehicles must substitute theirs; not having the intelligence to direct itself, men who drive cars or vehicles must exercise\u00a0 their intelligence on its behalf.\u00a0 Seeing such child\u00a0 in the street in front of his vehicle, the driver thereof must reduce the vehicle to such control that, if the child by a sudden dart places itself in front of the vehicle, the driver may save it from injury\u00a0 by stopping his vehicle.\"<\/blockquote>In the case at bar, however, the evidence clearly discloses that the boy who was killed was a lad 10 or 12 years of age.\u00a0 Boys 10 or 12 years of age, unattended by their parents or guardians, are always to be found on the streets and bypaths of our cities and villages, and no one questions their right to be there.\u00a0 A driver of a vehicle seeing a boy of that age on the street or side path may fairly assume that he has sufficient \"intelligence to direct\" himself under ordinary conditions.\u00a0 Indeed boys of that age are often more wide awake and alert in avoiding danger than are their elders, as anyone who has ever watched a crowd of lively newsboys plying their trade will readily agree.\u00a0 Manifestly, it would place an intolerable burden on all wheeled traffic on our streets and highways, to rule that the drivers of all vehicles, when they see boys 10 or 12 years of age on the street or side path or riding on other vehicles, unattended by their parents or guardians, must\u00a0 reduce their vehicles to such control that, if one of\u00a0 these boys \"by a sudden dart\" places himself in front of a vehicle, \"the driver may save him from injury by stopping his vehicle.\"\u00a0 Boys 10 or 12 years\u00a0 of age, who are permitted to go about unattended, may fairly be presumed to have sense enough to take care of themselves from the ordinary and usual dangers of street traffic.<br\/><br\/>The accused in the case at bar cannot be said to have been negligent in the management of his machine, merely because he did not anticipate that the boy, 10 or 12 years of age, who was riding on the slow-moving road roller, would jump down directly in front of him at the moment when he turned his machine out into the open street in an effort to pass by.\u00a0 And it appearing that in all other respects he operated his machine carefully, prudently, and skillfully at the time when the accident occurred, having regard to all the surrounding circumstances, he must be acquitted of all criminal liability arising out\u00a0 of the unfortunate accident which resulted in the death of the boy.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the lower court convicting and sentencing the appellant should be and is hereby reversed, and he should be and is hereby acquitted of the offense with which he is charged, with\u00a0 the costs of both instances <i>de oficio<\/i>.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

That the herein plaintiffs excepted to the judgment and appealed therefrom to the Supreme Court which found for them by holding that they are the owners of the lot in question, although there existed and still exists a commodatum by virtue of which the guardianship (meaning the <i>defendants<\/i>) had and has the use, and the plaintiffs the ownership, of the property, with no finding concerning the decree of the lower court that ordered the sale.\"<\/blockquote>The obvious purport of the clause \"although there existed and still exists a commodatum,\" etc., appears to be that it is a part of the decision of the Supreme Court and that, while finding the plaintiffs to be the owners of the lot, we recognized in principle the existence of a commodatum under which the defendants held the lot.\u00a0 Nothing could be\u00a0 more inexact.\u00a0 Possibly, also, the meaning of that clause is that, notwithstanding the finding made by the Supreme Court that the plaintiffs were the owners, these former and the defendants agree that there existed, and still exists, a commodatum, etc.\u00a0 But such an agreement would not affect the truth of the contents of the decision of this court, and the opinions held by the litigants in regard to this point could have no bearing whatever on the present decision.<br\/><br\/>Nor did the decree of the lower court that ordered the sale have the least influence in our previous decision to require our making any finding in regard thereto, for, with or without that decree, the Supreme Court had to decide the ownership of the lot consistently with its titles and not in accordance with the judicial acts or proceedings had\u00a0 prior to the setting up of the issue in respect to the ownership of the property that was the subject of the judicial decree.<br\/><br\/>What is essentially pertinent to the case is the fact that the defendants agree that the plaintiffs have the ownership, and they themselves only the use, of the said lot.<br\/><br\/>On this premise, the nullity of the sale\u00a0 of the lot is in all respects quite evident, whatsoever be the manner in which the sale was effected, whether judicially or extrajudicially.<br\/><br\/>He who has only the use of a thing cannot validly sell the thing itself.\u00a0 The effect of the sale being a transfer of the ownership of the thing, it is evident that he who has only the mere use of the thing cannot transfer its ownership.\u00a0 The sale of a thing effected by one who is not its owner is null and void.\u00a0 The defendants never were the owners of the lot sold.\u00a0 The sale of it by them is necessarily null and void.\u00a0 One cannot convey to another what he has never had himself.<br\/><br\/>The returns of the auction contain the following statements:<br\/><blockquote>\"I, Ruperta Pascual, the guardian of the minors, etc., by virtue of the authorization\u00a0 conferred upon me on the 31st of July, 1909,\u00a0 by the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Norte, proceeded with the sale at public auction of the six-sevenths part of the one-half of the warehouse constructed of rubble stone, etc.<br\/><br\/>\"Whereas I, Ruperta Pascual, the guardian of the minors, etc., sold at public auction all the land and all the rights, title, interest, and ownership in the said property to Cu Joco, who was the highest bidder, etc.<br\/><br\/>\"Therefore,\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 I cede and deliver forever to the said purchaser, Cu Joco, his heirs and assigns, all the interest, ownership and inheritance rights and others that, as the guardian of the said minors, I have and may have in the said property, etc.\"<\/blockquote>The purchaser could not acquire anything more than the interest that might be held by a person to whom realty in possession of the vendor might be sold, for at a judicial auction nothing else is disposed of.\u00a0 What the minor children of Ruperta Pascual had in their possession was the ownership of the six-sevenths part of one-half of the warehouse and the use of the lot occupied by this building.\u00a0 This, and nothing more, could the Chinaman Cu Joco acquire at that sale: not the ownership of the lot; neither the other half, nor the remaining one-seventh of the said first half, of the warehouse.\u00a0 Consequently, the sale made to him of this one-seventh of one-half and the entire other half of the building was null and void, and likewise with still more reason the sale of the\u00a0 lot the building occupies.<br\/><br\/>The purchaser could and should have known what it was that was offered for sale and what it was that he purchased.\u00a0 There is nothing that can justify the acquisition by the purchaser of the warehouse of the ownership of the lot that this building occupies, since the minors represented by Ruperta Pascual never were the owners of the said lot, nor were they ever considered to be such.<br\/><br\/>The trial court, in the judgment rendered, held that there were no grounds for the requested annulment of the sale, and that the plaintiffs were entitled to the P600 deposited with the clerk of the court as the value of the lot in question.\u00a0 The defendants, Ruperta Pascual and the Chinaman Cu Joco, were absolved from the complaint, without express finding as to costs.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiffs cannot be obliged to acquiesce in or allow the sale made and be compelled to accept the price set on the lot by expert appraisers, not even though the plaintiffs be considered as coowners of the warehouse.\u00a0 It would be much indeed that, on the ground of coownership, they should have to abide by and tolerate the sale of the said building, which point this court does not decide as it is not a question submitted to us for decision, but, as regards the sale of the lot, it is in all respects impossible to hold that the plaintiffs must abide by it and tolerate it, and this conclusion is based on the fact that they did not give their consent (art. 1261, Civil Code), and only the contracting parties who have given it are obliged to comply (art. 1091, <i>idem<\/i>).<br\/><br\/>The sole purpose of the action in the beginning was to obtain an annulment of the sale of the lot; but subsequently the plaintiffs, through\u00a0 motion, asked for an amendment of their complaint in the sense that the action should be deemed to be one for the recovery\u00a0 of possession of a lot and for the annulment of its sale.\u00a0 The plaintiffs' petition was opposed by the defendants' attorney, but was allowed by the court; therefore the complaint seeks, after the judicial annulment of the sale of the lot, to have the defendants sentenced immediately to deliver the same to the plaintiffs.<br\/><br\/>Such a finding appears to be in harmony with the decision rendered by the Supreme Court in the previous suit, wherein it was held that the ownership of the lot lay in the plaintiffs, and for this reason steps were taken to give possession thereof to the defendants; but, as the purchaser Cu Joco was not a party to\u00a0 that suit, the present action is strictly one for recovery against Cu Joco to compel him, once the sale has been annulled, to deliver the lot to its lawful owners, the plaintiffs.<br\/><br\/>As respects this action for recovery, this Supreme Court finds: <ol> <li>That it is a fact admitted by the litigating parties, both in this and in the previous suit, that Andres Fontanilla, the defendants' predecessor in interest, erected the warehouse on the lot, some thirty\u00a0 years ago, with the explicit consent of his brother Francisco Fontanilla, the plaintiffs' predecessor in interest.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>That it also appears to be an admitted fact that the plaintiffs and the defendants are the coowners of the warehouse.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>That it is a fact explicity admitted in the agreement, that neither Andres Fontanilla nor his successors paid any consideration or price whatever for the use of the lot occupied by the said building; whence it is, perhaps, that both parties have denominated that use a commodatum.<\/li><\/ol>Upon the premise of these facts, or even merely upon that of the first of them, the sentencing of the defendants to deliver the lot to the plaintiffs does not follow as a necessary corollary of the judicial declaration of ownership made in the previous suit, nor of that of the nullity of the sale of the lot, made in the present case.<br\/><br\/>The defendants do not hold lawful possession of the lot in question.<br\/><br\/>But, although both litigating parties may have agreed in their idea of the commodatum, on account of its not being, as indeed it is not, a question of fact but of law, yet that denomination given by them to the use of the lot granted by Francisco Fontanilla to his brother, Andres Fontanilla, is not acceptable.\u00a0 Contracts are not to be interpreted in conformity with the name that the parties thereto agree to give them, but must be construed, duly considering their constitutive elements, as they\u00a0 are defined and denominated by law.<br\/><blockquote>\"By the contract of loan, one of the parties delivers to the other, either anything not perishable, in order that the latter may use it during a <i>certain period<\/i> and return it to the former, in which case it is\u00a0 called <i>commodatum<\/i>\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 \" (art. 1740, Civil Code).<\/blockquote>It is, therefore, an essential feature of the commodatum that the use of the thing belonging to another shall be for a certain period.\u00a0 Francisco Fontanilla did not fix any definite period of time during which Andres Fontanilla could have the use of the lot whereon the latter was to erect a stone warehouse of considerable value, and so it is that for the past thirty years the lot has been used by both Andres and his successors\u00a0 in interest.\u00a0 The present contention of the plaintiffs that Cu Joco, now in possession of the lot, should pay rent for it at the rate of P5 a month, would destroy the theory of the commodatum sustained by them, since, according to the second paragraph of the aforecited article 1740, \"commodatum is essentially gratuitous,\" and, if what the plaintiffs themselves aver on page 7 of their brief is to be believed, it never entered\u00a0 Francisco's mind\u00a0 to limit the period during which his brother Andres was to have the use of the lot, because he expected that the warehouse would eventually fall into the hands of his son, Fructuoso Fontanilla, called the adopted son of Andres, which did not come to pass for the reason that Fructuoso died before his uncle Andres.\u00a0 With that expectation in view, it appears more likely that Francisco intended to allow his brother Andres a surface right; but this right supposes the payment of an annual rent, and Andres had the gratuitous use of the lot.<br\/><br\/>Hence, as the facts aforestated only show that a building was erected on another's ground, the question should be decided in accordance with the statutes that, thirty years ago, governed accessions to real estate, and which were Laws 41 and 42, title 28, of ,the third <i>Partida<\/i>, nearly\u00a0 identical with the provisions of articles 361 and 362 of the Civil Code.\u00a0 So, then, pursuant to article 361, the owner of the land on which a building is erected in good faith has a right to appropriate such edifice to himself, after payment of the indemnity prescribed in articles 453 and 454, or to oblige the builder to pay him the value of the land.\u00a0 Such, and no other, is the right to which the plaintiffs are entitled.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, it is only necessary to annul the sale of the said lot which was made by Ruperta Pascual, in representation of her minor children, to Cu Joco, and to maintain the latter in the use of the lot until the plaintiffs shall choose one or the other of the two rights granted them by article 361 of the Civil Code.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is reversed and the sale of the lot in question is held to be null and void and of no force or effect.\u00a0 No special finding is made as to the costs of both instances.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Johnson, Carson, Moreland<\/i>, and <i>Trent, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><br\/><br\/><hr align=\"LEFT\" noshade=\"NOSHADE\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> Pascual <i>vs<\/i>.

THE HON. HERBERT D. GALE, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF MANILA, AND JOSE MCMICKING, CLERK OF SAID COURT, DEFENDANTS.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>CARSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">This is an application for a writ of prohibition directed to the defendant judge of the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, commanding him to cease any attempt to exercise his judicial authority to direct the destruction of certain lottery tickets; and praying at the same time for a restraining order to the clerk of that court, to prevent his carrying into effect an order entered by the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, directing him to destroy these tickets.<br\/><br\/>It appears that these tickets were introduced in evidence in the course of a certain criminal proceeding had in the Court of First Instance; that the defendant in these proceedings, in whose possession these tickets were found,pleaded guilty on charge of \"illegal importation\", and was convicted on that plea; that upon conviction of the defendant, the trial judge ordered the destruction of the tickets; that counsel for the Insular Collector of Customs, in whose custody the tickets were at the time when they were offered in evidence, objected to their destruction and prayed for their return to him, on the ground that at the time when the tickets were introduced in evidence in the Court of First Instance, he, the Insular Collector of Customs, who had seized the tickets\u00a0 under the provisions of section 313 of Act No. 355, was engaged in the proceedings provided in that Act for the confiscation of these tickets and for their disposition thereafter in accordance with law; that these proceedings had been instituted prior to the filing of the criminal action in the course of which the tickets were offered in evidence; that the Insular Collector of Customs had assumed jurisdiction over the subject matter of these confiscation proceedings, that is to say, of the lottery tickets in question, at the time when the confiscation\u00a0 proceedings were instituted; and that the law imposed upon him the duty\u00a0 of passing upon and deciding, in the first instance, the question as to the forfeiture and further disposition of these lottery tickets.<br\/><br\/>Without entering upon or considering the\u00a0 question of the final disposition of these tickets, which is not properly before us at this time, we hold that the Insular Collector of Customs is entitled to have them returned to him for their proper disposition in the proceedings pending before him.<br\/><br\/>We do not question the right and\u00a0 the duty of a Court of First Instance, under ordinary circumstances, to issue the necessary orders for the confiscation and\u00a0 destruction of lottery tickets\u00a0 upon the conviction of one found with such tickets unlawfully in his possession or control.\u00a0 Judicial authority for the issuance of such orders is quite clearly deducible from the terms of the various\u00a0 Acts of the Philippine Commission looking to the suppression of lotteries and of traffic in lottery tickets; and there\u00a0 can be no doubt that under the general prohibitory and penalizing provisions of the law directed against lotteries and gambling in lottery tickets Courts of First Instance would ordinarily be held to be acting within their jurisdiction in directing the destruction of lottery tickets in like manner and under like conditions as, under the provisions of articles 607 and 608 of the Penal Code, similar orders are issued for the confiscation and destruction of adulterated foods and drinks, false\u00a0 coins, light weights, paraphernalia used in prohibited gambling games and raffles, and the like.\u00a0 But we think that under the special circumstances of the case at bar, it was clearly the duty of the trial judge to refrain from taking jurisdiction to issue the order for the destruction of the tickets, and to leave the question as to their confiscation and future disposition to the Collector of Customs, who, under due authority of law, was engaged in the prescribed proceedings to that very end at the time when these tickets were submitted in evidence in the Court of First Instance.<br\/><br\/>The question whether the order for the confiscation and destruction of such property should issue in a particular case is, in the very nature of things, left to the sound discretion of the court.\u00a0 Article 608 of the Penal Code expressly provides that \"The courts may in their discretion in view of the circumstances of the respective cases, order the forfeiture\" of the \"instruments and articles\" the destruction of which is authorized in article 607.\u00a0 And we hold that in all cases wherein the authority to confiscate and destroy property is conferred upon a court as an incident to a criminal proceeding pending before it, the exercise of such authority is placed in the sound judicial discretion of the court, The ground upon which such confiscation and destruction rests is\u00a0 that, in their very nature, such \"instruments and articles\" cannot be used by their owner for any lawful purpose, and that their continued existence may prove detrimental to the public welfare.\u00a0 But we think that the arbitrary confiscation and destruction of such articles would constitute an abuse of the discretion conferred upon the court in a case where it is made to appear that, in the interests of justice, their preservation is demanded for some lawful purpose.\u00a0 Thus the destruction of counterfeit money, weapons, gambling devices and the like found on the person or in the possession of a convict, would not be justified in a case where it is made to appear that these articles may prove to be of vital importance as exhibits in the prosecution of other charges against the\u00a0 convict, or against other persons, in the same or some other court; and it will not be doubted that it would be a clear abuse of discretion if the destruction of exhibits of this nature, filed in a case pending in this court and temporarily loaned for use as exhibits in another case in a Court of First Instance, were arbitrarily and summarily ordered to be destroyed by the judge of that court at the conclusion of the trial had before him.<br\/><br\/>While the case under consideration is not exactly analogous, nevertheless the same rules of comity, the same regard for the orderly course of the proceedings in courts and tribunals duly constituted by law in these Islands, which would forbid the arbitrary destruction of the exhibits or the subject matter of the proceedings in one case, forbid it in the other.\u00a0 The Collector of\u00a0 Customs when sitting in forfeiture proceedings, as provided in Act No. 355, constitutes a tribunal upon which the law expressly confers jurisdiction to hear and determine all questions touching the forfeiture and further disposition of the subject matter of such proceedings, and since he had assumed jurisdiction over the lottery tickets in question it was clearly the duty of the Judge of the Court of First Instance to abstain from any attempt to invade that jurisdiction by ordering their destruction.<br\/><br\/>It is quite clear from the observations of the respondent judge in his rulings on the application for the return of the tickets and his answer to the order of this court to show cause, that the real ground on which he based his refusal to respect the jurisdiction of the Collector in the premises was that he believed\u00a0 that\u00a0 the law imposed the duty on the Collector to destroy the tickets in the event of their confiscation, and that he feared the Collector would not comply with the law if the tickets were returned the his possession.\u00a0 But if the Collector fails to comply with the law in the course of the proceedings pending before him, or if he undertakes to dispose of these tickets unlawfully in the event that he orders their confiscation, the proper remedy can then be invoked, and his action reviewed in an orderly proceeding by the proper authority; and the fear that he may misconstrue or misapply the law in no wise justified the respondent judge in invading his jurisdiction and ordering the destruction of the subject matter of the proceedings pending before him.<br\/><br\/>It is a subversion of the judicial power to take a cause from a court having jurisdiction before its final decision is given.\u00a0 As was said in the case of Mail <i>vs<\/i>. Maxwell (107 111,, 554, 555), \"Where one court has acquired jurisdiction, no other court, State or Federal, will, in the\u00a0 absence of supervising or appellate jurisdiction, interfere, unless in pursuance of some statute, State or Federal, providing for such interference.\"<br\/><br\/>Ten days hereafter let the writ issue in accordance with the prayer of the petition, the costs of the proceedings in this court <i>de oficio.<\/i><br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

As the tax accrues when the manufacturer sells,\u00a0 his wholesale price includes it, and the purchaser who buys these cotton velvets in\u00a0 wholesale quantities\u00a0 in\u00a0 the German\u00a0 markets\u00a0 pays a price covering the tax, and that is the price for the merchandise\u00a0 when bought and sold in these markets\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 * but the laws of this\u00a0 country in the assessment of duties proceed upon the market value in the exporting country and not\u00a0 upon that market value less such remission or amelioration as that country chooses to allow in\u00a0 accordance with its own views of public policy.\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *<br\/><blockquote> \"The\u00a0 second question\u00a0 must also\u00a0 be\u00a0 answered in the affirmative.\" <\/blockquote>It is to be noted in the case at bar that the value appearing on the first invoice presented by the importer at the customhouse was accepted as the\u00a0 dutiable value of the merchandise.\u00a0 If this value was incorrect, then it became the duty of the\u00a0 importer to treat such invoice as<i> pro forma <\/i>merely and\u00a0 file\u00a0 a\u00a0 bond for the presentation of a correct consular\u00a0 invoice.\u00a0 (United\u00a0 States <i>vs.<\/i> Frank &amp; Lambert, United States Treasury Decision No. 31973; United States <i>vs.<\/i> Bennett &amp; Loewenthal,\u00a0 id.,\u00a0 No. 31975.)\u00a0\u00a0 This\u00a0 was not done, but the importer sought to amend the original invoice by\u00a0 the\u00a0 presentation of\u00a0 a\u00a0 second\u00a0 invoice\u00a0 consulated\u00a0 in another consular district, and, on the hearing in the Court of First Instance, he was\u00a0 permitted, over\u00a0 the\u00a0 objections and exceptions of the appellant herein, to prove the value of the\u00a0 merchandise in\u00a0 France, a place\u00a0 and country from which\u00a0 no\u00a0 consular invoice covering the merchandise\u00a0 in question had been\u00a0 presented.\u00a0 The importer did not, how ever, offer any evidence as\u00a0 to the value of the goods either in Hamburg, the place from\u00a0 which they were\u00a0 originally invoiced, or in Antwerp, the place where they were alleged to have been placed on\u00a0 board ship bound to the Philippine Islands.<br\/><br\/>In the absence of a bond\u00a0 to produce a\u00a0 corrected consular invoice, and\u00a0 especially\u00a0 where\u00a0 a second\u00a0 and third invoice have been\u00a0 presented which are defective,\u00a0 the first invoice cannot\u00a0 be\u00a0 impugned by\u00a0 the importer presenting\u00a0 it, nor can he be heard to\u00a0 say that\u00a0 it is incorrect.\u00a0\u00a0 If an importer desires to correct his own mistake relative to the contents of an invoice, he must comply with the\u00a0 requirements of the law and\u00a0 the rules and\u00a0 regulations of the department pertaining to such\u00a0 correction.\u00a0\u00a0 It is\u00a0 presumed that every importer is familiar with the law and\u00a0 with the rules of the department.\u00a0\u00a0 It is usually his own fault if he does not comply\u00a0 with them. While\u00a0 the result in this\u00a0 particular case may be a hardship on the importer and while, in many respects, it is clear that he has paid a\u00a0 higher\u00a0 duty than he ought to have paid if his contention as to the facts is true,\u00a0 nevertheless it appears that\u00a0 all that\u00a0 was a result of\u00a0 his\u00a0 own\u00a0 negligence\u00a0 or failure\u00a0 to\u00a0 meet properly the requirements of the law and the\u00a0 rules and regulations of the department.\u00a0 Courts\u00a0 are\u00a0 not permitted to abrogate laws or destroy reasonable rules and regulations of\u00a0 a department.\u00a0 They were made,\u00a0 the one\u00a0 by the legislature, the other\u00a0 by officials with full\u00a0 power in\u00a0 the\u00a0 premises. Courts cannot abrogate the one unless unconstitutional, and it will\u00a0 not interfere with the other where\u00a0 they are just and reasonable.<br\/><br\/>The presumption\u00a0 is that the action of the Insular Collector of Customs was correct (par. 14, sec. 334, Code of Civil Procedure; Vandiver<i> vs.<\/i> United States, 156 Fed.

TOMAS OSME\u00d1A, APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>MORELAND, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\"> This is an appeal from an order of the Court of First Instance of Cebu, refusing to extend the time within which claims could be presented to commissioners in the above-named estate.<br\/><br\/>The facts are that Tomas Osme\u00f1a claims to have had a claim against the estate of Telesforo de Dios, but did not present the same within the six months specified by the court for the presentation of claims to the commissioners.\u00a0 The time having expired within which the claim should have been presented, the claimant made a motion to the court asking for an extension of the time within which he could present said claim.\u00a0 Said motion was founded upon a statement alleging as the only foundation for the motion that said claimant \"had not had an opportunity to formulate his claim during the period of six months fixed by the court.\"\u00a0 Later the statement was amended and amplified so as to include the allegation that the reason why said claim had not been\u00a0 presented was, \"that during said time one of the heirs of said\u00a0 estate was making propositions\u00a0 to said Tomas Osme\u00f1a to pay on his own account the debt which he had against the property of said estate; that said\u00a0 Tomas Osme\u00f1a, under the belief that the said heir would pay the said debt, and in the hope that the\u00a0 proposed settlement would terminate satisfactorily, could not duly formulate his claim before the commission during said period of six months; that said heir did not pay the debt or any part thereof to said Tomas Osme\u00f1a as he had at first offered to do.\"<br\/><br\/>The Court, Honorable Adolph Wislizenus presiding, denied the motion to extend the time, saying:<br\/><blockquote>\"The power of the court to extend\u00a0 the time for certain purposes is defined in article 690 of the Code of Civil Procedure and from a reading of said article it appears that a condition precedent to the exercise of such power is a just cause.\u00a0 The court does not find in said motion any allegation which it can call a just cause.\u00a0\u00a0 The only allegation in relation to the matter is that he has not had opportunity to present his claim against the estate within the six months fixed by the court, without stating any details or facts relative to such failure of opportunity.\u00a0 The applicant is a merchant of much experience, a resident of the municipality of Cebu, where he has lived and where the deceased, Telesforo de Dios, died, who was also a person well known in Cebu.\u00a0 It is imposible that Tomas Osme\u00f1a was not informed and did not know of the death of said Telesforo de Dios, and Mr. Osme\u00f1a is a person who has many suits in this court, both special proceedings and civil actions.\u00a0 The object of the administration of estates under the Code of Civil Procedure is to give an opportunity to the creditors to present their claims and a determination of the condition of the property left by the deceased and to prevent the presentation of claims after certain dates.\u00a0 It is in the interest of the law and of the spirit of the Code of Civil Procedure that the claims be presented within the period fixed by the law and that the time for presentation be not extended without just cause.\u00a0 As the present motion is in no\u00a0 manner founded on facts which we may consider just cause, the court for that reason denies the motion.\"<\/blockquote>A motion was later made for a rehearing before the Honorable George N. Hurd, which was denied.\u00a0 An appeal is taken from such order.\u00a0 The appellant makes the following assignments of error:<br\/><blockquote>\"(1)\u00a0 The court erred in denying the motion of the 29th of February basing the same on the order of the same court of the 24th of February of the same year; (2) the court erred in denying the motion of the 29th of February notwithstanding the fact that said motion was based upon reasons justifying the same; (3) the court erred in denying the motion notwithstanding the fact that it was presented within twelve months after the appointment of commissioners.\"<\/blockquote>The only question presented on this appeal is whether or not the court erred in refusing to extend the period for the presentation of claims against the estate of Telesforo de Dios upon the facts presented by the appellant.<br\/><br\/>The court below correctly said that there must be cause shown before it would be authorized to extend the time within which claims may be presented against the estate.\u00a0 The object of the law\u00a0 in fixing a definite period within which claims must be presented is to insure the speedy settling of the affairs of a deceased person and the early delivery of the property of the estate into the hands of the persons entitled to receive it.\u00a0 As we said in the case of Jose McMicking <i>vs<\/i>. Sy Conbieng (21 Phil. Rep., 211), \"it is the policy of every people which maintains the principle of private ownership of property that he who owns a thing shall not be deprived of its possession or use except for the most urgent and imperative reasons and then only so long as is necessary to make the rights which underlie these reasons effective;\" and, \"it is a principle of universal acceptance which declares that one has the instant right to occupy that which he owns, and it is only in the presence of reasons of the strongest and most urgent nature that that principle is prevented from accomplishing the purpose which underlies it.\"\u00a0 It is distinctly against the interests of justice and in direct opposition to the policy of the law to extend unduly the time\u00a0 within which estates should be administered and thereby to keep the property from the possession and use of those who are entitled to\u00a0 it.\u00a0 Before the time in which claimants must present their claims against an estate is extended the person asking the privilege must present sound reasons therefor.\u00a0 Whether or not those reasons are sufficient and whether as a result of their presentation the time ought or ought not to be extended rests in the sound discretion of the court.\u00a0 This being so, a decision as to whether or not the time shall be extended will not be disturbed on appeal unless it clearly appears that there has been an abuse of that discretion.\u00a0 It is a doctrine followed by this court as by all others that, where a court has discretion, the exercise thereof will not be interfered with\u00a0 except in case of abuse.\u00a0 The general doctrine (as stated in 3 Cyc, 325) is to the effect that, \"in the absence of a clear abuse of discretion, to the complaining party's prejudice, matters purely within the discretion of the trial court are not reviewable on appeal.\"\u00a0 Moreover, the doctrine is also stated in the same volume (p. 327) that, \"it will be presumed on appeal, in the absence of a showing to the contrary, that the discretionary powers of the lower court have been exercised without abuse.\u00a0 The burden of showing abuse is upon the party complaining.\"<br\/><br\/>In the case at bar the appellant failed to show that the court below abused the discretion given it by law.\u00a0 In the first place, the appellant has not shown that he has a meritorious claim against the estate.\u00a0 There appears\u00a0 nothing in the record demonstrating what the nature of the claim is, how it was contracted, or\u00a0 when.\u00a0 There is simply a naked allegation that appellant has a claim.\u00a0 In the second place, the appellant, admitting full knowledge of the time within which he should have presented his claim and the date on which the time for presentation expired, presents no sufficient explanation for failure to present the claim within that period.\u00a0 His only excuse is that during the running of the period he was maintaining negotiations with one of the heirs for the payment of the claim.\u00a0 Even if that were true, it furnishes no reason why the\u00a0 claim was not presented.\u00a0 Although the negotiations may have been pending, the claim could have been presented nevertheless and, on payment thereof by the heir, further proceedings could have been prevented.<br\/><br\/>Under these circumstances the court committed no error in refusing to extend the time within which the claim could be presented.\u00a0 (<i>In re<\/i> estate of Ceballos, 13 Phil. Rep., 315.)<br\/><br\/>The order appealed from is affirmed, with costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J<\/i>., <i>Torres<\/i> and <i>Johnson, JJ<\/i>., concur. <\/div>",

GARZA, INTERVENER AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>MORELAND, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">This action springs from a collision between the steamship <i>Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar<\/i>, owned by the plaintiff, and the schooner <i>Mangyan<\/i>, owned by the defendant, which occurred in the early morning of the 8th of April, 1910, in Verde Island North Passage.\u00a0 The sail vessel was sailing with a fresh breeze dead\u00a0 astern, her sails wing and wing.\u00a0 The steamer was seen by those on board the sailing vessel some time before the actual collision, sailing erratically.\u00a0 The sail vessel kept her course steady until just before the actual contact when her helmsman threw her hard to port in an effort to avoid the collision.\u00a0 The movement, however, was unsuccessful and the sail vessel rammed the steamer on the starboard quarter well aft.\u00a0 The steamer sank and eight lives were lost.\u00a0 The sail vessel was considerably injured.<br\/><br\/>This action was brought by the owners of the steamship against the owners of the sail vessel, to recover the value of the destroyed steamer and the damages caused by reason of its destruction, alleging as a basis therefor the negligence of the sail vessel.\u00a0 The defendant denied the material allegations of the complaint and set up a counterclaim for damages, alleging as grounds therefor that the injuries sustained by the sail vessel were due to the gross negligence of those handling plaintiff's steamer.<br\/><br\/>Before the action was tried, M. Garza made an application to intervene under the provisions of section 121 of\u00a0 the Code of Civil Procedure, he alleging in support of his application that the steamer was carrying for him at the time several thousand pesos' worth of merchandise as freight, which was lost as a result of the collision.\u00a0 He was permitted to intervene and accordingly filed a complaint setting up the loss of his merchandise and the value thereof and alleging, as the basis for his right to recover, the negligence of one or the other of the vessels, without specifying which, and praying that the court award him damages against that vessel the negligence of which, upon the trial, was shown to have caused his loss.<br\/><br\/>The case turns upon the question which of the vessels was negligent in failing to conform to the International Rules for the Prevention of Collisions at Sea.\u00a0 The learned trial court found that those managing the steamer were guilty of gross negligence and that for that reason the plaintiff could recover nothing.<br\/><br\/>An examination of the record leaves no doubt that the finding of the trial court that the steamer was handled in a grossly negligent manner is clearly and fully supported by the evidence.\u00a0 No other finding could be sustained.<br\/><br\/>Relative to the alleged negligence of the sail vessel the learned trial court said :<br\/><blockquote>\"I am satisfied beyond any reasonable doubt that the steamer <i>Ntra. Sra. del Pilar<\/i> was sailing erratically, that it did not have a proper watch on board, and that it therefore contributed neglect to the collision.<br\/><br\/>\"I am also thoroughly satisfied that the sailing vessel <i>Mangyan<\/i> had its lights properly on it long before the time the collision occurred, and that the lights were so arranged upon the rigging of the vessel as to comply with the rules, and that they were visible and were seen by the crew of the steamer <i>Elcano<\/i> and could have been seen by the watchman or the chief officer of the steamer <i>Ntra. Sra. del Pilar<\/i>, if they\u00a0 had been on the lookout for them;<br\/><br\/>\"That the steamer <i>Ntra, Sra. del Pilar<\/i>, being bound to keep out of the course of the sailing vessel and suddenly seeing the sailing vessel very close, went over hard to port and crossed the course of the sailing vessel.<br\/><br\/>\"I also find that the sailing vessel, notwithstanding the erratic\u00a0 movements of the steamer, proceeded directly on its course regardless of consequences when with all the searoom there was it\u00a0 could easily have maneuvered so as to very well avoid the collision, and thereby having contributed neglect to the collision, neither is entitled to recover from the other any damages which may have occurred.\"<\/blockquote>These facts and circumstances clearly appear in the record and fully sustain the conclusions reached.<br\/><br\/>We are of the opinion that under the facts stated in the decision of the trial court the defendant was entitled to recover upon its counterclaim.<br\/><br\/>It being clear from the evidence that the gross negligence of those\u00a0 managing the steamer brought it into such close proximity to the sail vessel that a collision was apparently inevitable, the question is whether or not the sail vessel was negligent in continuing its course without variation up to the moment that it found itself <i>in extremis.<\/i><br\/><br\/>Article 20 of the International Rules for the Prevention of Collisions at Sea is as follows:\u00a0 \"If two ships, one of which is a sailing ship and the other a steam ship, are proceeding in such directions as to involve risk of collision, the steam ship shall keep out of the way of the sailing ship.\"<br\/><br\/>Article 21 is as follows:\u00a0 \"Where by any of these\u00a0 rules one of two vessels is to keep out of the way, the other shall keep her course and speed.\"<br\/><br\/>Generally speaking, in collisions between vessels there exist three divisions of time, or zones:\u00a0 The first division covers all the time up to the moment when the risk of collision may be said to have begun.\u00a0 Within this zone no rule is applicable because none is necessary.\u00a0 Each vessel is free to direct its course as it deems best without reference to the movements of the other vessel.\u00a0 The second division covers the time between the moment when the risk\u00a0 of collision begins and the moment when it has become a practical\u00a0 certainty.\u00a0 The third division covers the time between the moment when collision has become a practical certainty and the moment of actual contact.<br\/><br\/>It was during the time when the sail vessel was passing through the third zone that it changed its course to port in order to avoid, if possible, the collision.\u00a0 This act may be said to have been done <i>in extremis<\/i>, and, even if wrong, the sailing vessel is not responsible for the result.<br\/><br\/>The question before us, as presented by the finding of the trial court, arises wholly over the action of the schooner in keeping her course through the second zone, that is, during the period when there was a risk of collision.\u00a0 In resolving this question we have to note the well-established presumption which favors the sail vessel in cases of this character.\u00a0 The rule relative to this presumption is conservatively stated in volume 25 of the American and English Encyclopedia of Law, page 926:<br\/><blockquote>\"Subject to the genera] rules of evidence in collision cases as to the burden of\u00a0 proof, in the case of a collision between a steam vessel and a sail vessel, the presumption is against the steam vessel, and she must show that\u00a0 she took the proper measures to avoid a collision.\"<\/blockquote>Hughes on Admiralty, page 242, declares the law thus:<br\/><blockquote>\"A steamer must keep out of the way of a sail vessel.\u00a0 In doing\u00a0 so she must allow the sail vessel a wide berth.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>\"A steamer may take her own method of passing a sail vessel.\u00a0 The mere approach of the two vessels does not bring about risk of\u00a0 collision.\u00a0 The steamer may assume that the sail vessel will do her duty and do nothing to embarrass her.\u00a0 Hence the steamer may shape her course so as to avoid the sail vessel.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>\"This rule that vessels may each assume that the other will obey the law is one of the most important in the law of collision.\u00a0 Were it otherwise and were vessels required to take all sorts of measures to keep out of the way, when they are not in each other's way, navigation\u00a0 would be impossible.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 There is, however, one important qualification which must be borne in mind.\u00a0 It is that a steamer must not approach so near a sailing vessel, and on such a course as to alarm a man of ordinary skill and prudence.\u00a0 If the man on the sailing vessel makes an improper maneuver, he is not responsible.\u00a0 It is what is called an 'error in extremis.'\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 The leading case on the subject is <i>The Lucille <\/i>(15 Wallace, 676).\u00a0 In that case a steamer and schooner were approaching on converging courses only half a point apart, so that they would have come within thirty yards of each other, and that in Chesapeake Bay.\u00a0 The\u00a0 court held that this was too close and condemned the steamer.\"<\/blockquote>On page 245 the same author says:<br\/><blockquote>\"Article 21\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 renders it obligatory on the vessel which has the right of way to pursue her course.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 She must rely on the other vessel to avoid the collision and not embarrass her\u00a0 by any maneuver.\u00a0 All she need do is to do nothing.\u00a0 Then the other vessel knows what to expect and navigates accordingly.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>\"In collisions between steam and sail vessels the steamer's defense is almost invariably that the sail vessel changed her course.\"<\/blockquote>On page 255 of the same work appears the following:<br\/><blockquote>\"In <i>The Clara Davidson<\/i> (24 Fed., 763), the court said:\u00a0 'But I do not find\u00a0 myself at liberty to ignore the inquiry whether a statutory rule of navigation was violated by the schooner.\u00a0 These rules are the law of laws in cases of collision.\u00a0 They admit of no option or choice.\u00a0 No navigator is at liberty to set up his discretion against them.\u00a0 If these rules were subject to the caprice or election of masters and pilots they would be not only useless, but worse than useless.\u00a0 These rules are imperative.\u00a0 They\u00a0 yield to necessity, indeed, but only to actual and obvious necessity.\u00a0 It is not stating the principles too strongly to say that nothing but imperious necessity or some overpowering <i>vis major<\/i> will excuse a sail vessel in changing her course when in the presence of a steamer in motion.' \"<\/blockquote>Spencer on Marine Collisions, page 154, says:<br\/><blockquote>\"The duties imposed upon vessels are of a mutual character; and where the statute directs one to give way to the other, it imposes an equal duty upon the latter to continue on its course, and a change of course on its part is as unlawful as it would be for the other to refuse to yield the right of way.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>\"It is one of the conditions of the duty 'to keep out of the way,' that the other vessel shall act intelligently, and afford reasonable evidence of her intention; while it is doubtful what the\u00a0 other will do, the former should hold her course.\u00a0 Like all other rules for the prevention of collisions at sea, there may be special circumstances which would warrant a ship in departing from her course, where collision appears inevitable by pursuing it; indeed, it is her duty to do so; but until it plainly appears that there is no other alternative, a vessel should hold her course when in a position required to do so by the statute.\"<\/blockquote>On page 181 the same author says:<br\/><blockquote>\"The duty of one vessel to keep her course is not intended by the rules as a privilege conferred, but as an obligation imposed, in order to enable the\u00a0 other vessel with certainty to keep out of the way.\u00a0 In order to warrant a vessel to either change her course or speed, there must be reasonable certainty that the other is not doing her duty, and that the situation imperatively demands a departure from the rules.\u00a0 It is the duty of the vessel required to keep out of the way to give an early and intelligible expression of her intentions to do so; and while there is any doubt as to what her actions will be, the vessel required to hold her course may presume that the other will act intelligently and lawfully, and she should hold her course until the contrary appears.\u00a0 It is no excuse for a vessel taking a course forbidden by law that the unlawful course was the best one.\"<\/blockquote>In the American and English Encyclopedia of Jaw (vol. 25, p. 925) the rule is stated as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"But it must be a strong case which puts the sail vessel in the wrong for obeying the rule to hold her course, for the court must clearly see, not only that a deviation from the rule would have prevented the collision, but that the officer in charge of the sail vessel was guilty of negligence or a culpable want of seamanship in not perceiving the necessity for a departure from the rule and acting accordingly.\u00a0 The sail vessel is justified in holding her course to the last minute possible for the steamship\u00a0 to avoid her by making the necessary maneuver.\"<\/blockquote>In the case of St. John <i>vs<\/i>. Paine (10\u00a0 How., 557), the collision was between a schooner and a steamer.\u00a0 The schooner had no lights visible; the night was starlight and clear.\u00a0 The court reviewed the rules governing the management of sail vessels at some length, explained the rules applicable to the management of steam vessels, and gave the reasons why the rules which govern travelers on the highways of the sea should be strictly enforced.\u00a0 After showing the greater facility of maneuvering which a steamer has over a sail vessel and, therefore, the greater ability to avoid collisions, the court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"As a general rule, therefore, when meeting a sailing vessel, whether close hauled or with the wind free, the latter has a right\u00a0 to keep her course, and it is the duty of the steamer to adopt such precautions as will avoid her.\u00a0 (Cites cases.)<br\/><br\/>\"By an adherence to this rule on the part of the sailing vessel the steamer with a proper lookout will be enabled, when approaching in an opposite direction, to adopt the necessary measures to avoid the danger, and she will have a right to assume that the sailing vessel will keep her course.\u00a0 If the latter fails to do this, the fault will be attributable to her, and the master of the steamer will be responsible only for a fair exertion of the power of his vessel to avoid the collision under the unexpected change of the course of the other vessel, and the circumstances of the case.\"<\/blockquote>A similar case is that of The Genesee Chief <i>vs<\/i>. Fitzhugh (12 How., 443).\u00a0 This pertains also to a collision between a steamer, <i>The Genesee Chief<\/i>, and a sail vessel.\u00a0 The two watched each other for some time before the collision.\u00a0 The sailing vessel kept her course until <i>in extremis<\/i> when she made a wrong maneuver.\u00a0 The court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The collision took place in the open lake.\u00a0 It was a starlight night, and although there was a haze near the surface of the lake, it was not sufficient to conceal the <i>Cuba<\/i> from those on board of the\u00a0 propeller.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>\"The lake was smooth.\u00a0 The steamboat had the entire command of her course and a wide water, by which she might have passed the <i>Cuba<\/i> on either side, and at a safe distance.\u00a0 She was going at\u00a0 the rate of eight miles an hour.\u00a0 And if proper care had been taken on board the <i>Genesee Chief<\/i>, after the schooner was first seen, it would seem to be almost impossible that a collision could have happened with a vessel moving so slowly and sluggishly through the water even if she was carelessly or injudiciously managed.\u00a0 There was no necessity for passing so near her as to create the hazard.\u00a0 The steamboat could choose its own distance.\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>\"And the captain and crew of the <i>Cuba<\/i> appear to have been watchful and attentive from the time the propeller was discovered.\u00a0 Nor do we deem it material to inquire whether the order of the captain at the moment of collision was judicious or not.\u00a0 He saw the steamboat coming directly upon him; her speed not diminished; nor any measures taken to avoid a collision.\u00a0 And if, in the excitement and alarm of the moment, a different order might have been more fortunate, it was the fault of the propeller to have placed him in a situation where there was no time for thought; and she is responsible for the consequences.\u00a0 She had the power to have\u00a0 passed at a safer distance, and had no right to place the schooner in such jeopardy, that the error of a moment might cause her destruction, and endanger the lives of those on board.\u00a0 And if an error was committed under such circumstances it was not a fault.\"<\/blockquote>In the case of <i>The Ottawa<\/i> (3 Wall., 269), the court said:<br\/><br\/>\"Rules of navigation are obligatory from the time the necessity for\u00a0 precaution begins, and continue to be applicable as the vessels advance, so long as the means and opportunity to avoid the danger remain; but they do not apply to a vessel required to keep her course after the approach is so near that the collision is inevitable, and are equally inapplicable to vessels of every description while they are yet so distant from each other that measures of precaution have not become necessary.\"<br\/><br\/>This case exemplifies the three-zone\u00a0 theory already referred to.\u00a0 In the first zone no rules apply.\u00a0 In the second the burden is on the vessel required to keep away and avoid the danger.\u00a0 The third zone covers the period in which errors in <i>extremis<\/i> occur; and the rule is that the vessel which has forced the privileged vessel into danger is responsible even if the privileged vessel has committed an error within that zone.<br\/><br\/>The duty of the sailing vessel to keep her course is well exemplified in the leading case of The Lucille <i>vs<\/i>. Respass (15 Wall., 676), which was a collision between a schooner and a steamer.\u00a0 Both vessels saw each other in time to have avoided the collision.\u00a0 The court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The principles of law applicable to the case are well settled.\u00a0 They are\u00a0 not disputed\u00a0 by either\u00a0 party.\u00a0 In the case of <i>The Carrol<\/i> (8 Wall., 302), it is thus laid down, 'Nautical rules require that where a steamship and sailing vessel are approaching each other from opposite directions, or on intersecting lines, the steamship from the moment the sailing vessel is seen, shall watch with the highest diligence her course and movements so as to be able to adopt such timely means of precaution as will necessarily prevent the two boats from coming in contact.\u00a0 Fault on the part of the sailing vessel at the moment preceding a collision does not absolve a steamer which has suffered herself and a sailing vessel to get in such dangerous proximity as to cause inevitable alarm and confusion and collision as a consequence.\u00a0 The steamer, as having committed a far greater fault in allowing such proximity to be brought about, is chargeable with all the damages resulting from a collision.'<br\/><br\/>\"The rule laid down in the case of <i>The Fannie<\/i> (11 Wal., 238) is still more applicable to the case before us.\u00a0 It was held that a schooner meeting a steamer approaching her on a parallel line, with the difference of half a point in the course of the two, ought to have kept in her course; that a steamer approaching a sailing vessel is bound to keep out of her way, and to allow her a free and unobstructed passage.\u00a0 Whatever is necessary for this it is her duty to do, and to avoid whatever obstructs or endangers the sailing vessel in her course.\u00a0 If, therefore, the sailing vessel does not change her course so as to embarrass the steamer, and render it difficult for her to avoid a collision, the steamer alone is answerable for the damage of a collision, if there is one.\"<\/blockquote>In the case of <i>The Sea Gull<\/i> (23 Wall., 165), the court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"Steamers approaching\" a sail ship in such a direction as to involve risk of collision are required to keep out of the way of the sail ship; but the sail ship is required to keep her course unless the circumstances are such as to render a departure from the rule necessary in order to avoid immediate danger.<br\/><br\/>\"Vessels with sails being required to keep their course, the duty of adopting the necessary measures of precaution to keep out of the way is devolved upon the steamer subject only to the condition that the sail ship shall keep her course and do not act to embarrass the steamer in her efforts to perform her duty.\u00a0 Doubtless the steamer may go to the right or left if she can keep out of the way, but if not and the approach is such as to involve risk of collision she is required to slacken her speed, or, if necessary, stop and reverse, and if she fails to perform her duty as required by the rules\u00a0 of navigation she is responsible for the consequences if the sail vessel is without fault.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>\"Attempt is made in argument to show that the schooner also was in fault and that the case falls within the rule which requires that the damages shall be divided.<br\/><br\/>\"Support to that charge is\u00a0 attempted to be drawn from the assumed\u00a0 fact that the schooner changed her course in violation of the rule of navigation which requires the sail ship to keep her course, as a correlative duty to that of the steamer whenever the latter is required to keep out of the way.\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>\"Two answers are made by the libelants to that defense, either of which, if found to be true, is sufficient to exonerate the schooner:\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 (2) That the schooner made no change in her course until the collision was inevitable, nor until it became indispensably necessary in order to avoid immediate danger caused by the fault of the steamer.\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>\"Rules of navigation continue to be applicable as long as the means and opportunity remain to avoid the danger, but they do not apply to a vessel required to keep her course after the wrongful approach of the opposite vessel is so near that a collision is inevitable.\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>\"Nor will an error committed by the sail vessel under such circumstances of peril, if she is otherwise without fault, impair the right of the sail vessel to recover for the injuries occasioned by the collision, for the plain reason that those who produce the peril and put the sail vessel in that situation are chargeable with the error and must answer for the consequences.\u00a0 (Steamship Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Rumball, 21 How., 383.)<br\/><br\/>\"Subject to that exception the sail vessel must keep her course.\"<\/blockquote>In the case of <i>The Benefactor<\/i> (102 U. S., 214), the court laid down the following conclusions:<br\/><blockquote>\"1. Upon the steamship and schooner discovering each other proceeding in such directions as to involve risk of collision, as stated in the foregoing findings of fact, it was the right and duty of the schooner to keep her course, and the duty of the steamship to keep out of the way of the schooner, and the steamship was in fault in failing to perform that duty.<br\/><br\/>\"2. It was also the duty of the steamship under the circumstances stated, to pursue a course which should not needlessly put the schooner in imminent peril; and the steamship was in fault in failing to perform that duty.<br\/><br\/>\"3. It was the duty of the steamship, before the time when she did\u00a0 so, to slacken her speed or stop, and the steamship was in fault in failing to perform that duty.<br\/><br\/>\"4. If, when a collision had become imminent by reason of the fault of the steamship, any error was committed in <i>extremis<\/i> by those in charge of the schooner, the schooner is not responsible therefor.<br\/><br\/>\"5. The steamship had no right, under the circumstances stated, needlessly to place herself in such close proximity to the schooner that the error of a moment would bring destruction.<br\/><br\/>\"6. The collision was occasioned by the fault of the steamship, and the steamship should be condemned therefor.\"<\/blockquote>In the case of <i>The Badger State<\/i> (8 Fed. Rep., 526), the court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"Where a sailing vessel and one propelled by steam are approaching\u00a0 each other bow on, the steamer must give way.\u00a0 In case of a collision between such vessels, the steamer is <i>prima facie<\/i> in fault.\"<\/blockquote>In the case of <i>The Gate City<\/i> (90 Fed. Rep., 314), the court held, according to the syllabus:<br\/><blockquote>\"The rule requiring a sailing vessel meeting a steamer to hold her course is a broad and general one intended to put the burden of avoiding a collision upon the steamer; and, if the sailing vessel departs from the injunction the burden is on her to show some reasonable excuse therefor.<br\/><br\/>\"A disregard of the rule not demanded by a clearly existing exigency should not be excused.<br\/><br\/>\"Therefore, she will not be held in fault for adhering to her course, although the steamer seems to be maneuvering in an uncertain and dangerous way.\"<\/blockquote>We are satisfied from the authorities that, under the facts stated in the opinion of the trial court, the defendant is entitled to recover such damages as reasonably\u00a0 and naturally flowed from the collision.\u00a0 There is sufficient evidence in the record to fix such\u00a0 damages with reasonable accuracy.\u00a0 It was proved upon the trial that it would require an expenditure of P3,525 to put the sail vessel in the condition in which it was before the injury; that it cost P245 to get the vessel to Manila after the injury; that the value of the supplies lost was P240.99.\u00a0 The evidence relative to the loss of earnings is not sufficient to permit the court to formulate any conclusion in relation thereto, even if it be considered a proper item of damage.<br\/><br\/>We think the judgment of the trial court was correct in dismissing the complaint of intervention.\u00a0 The intervener had no \"legal interest in the matter in litigation, or in the success of either of the parties, or an interest against both.\"\u00a0 Their action was personal, involved no rights in property which extended beyond their immediate selves, and touched no third party in any of the ramifications of those rights.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the\u00a0 court below, in so far as it finds against the plaintiff and the intervener, is hereby affirmed.\u00a0 As to that portion which dismisses the counterclaim of the defendant, the Baco River Plantation Company, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded, with instructions to the trial court to enter judgment in favor of the defendant, the Baco River Plantation Company, and against the plaintiff, G. Urrutia &amp; Company, for the sum of P4,010.99, and costs.\u00a0 No costs on this appeal.<br\/><br\/>While it was held in the case of Philippine Shipping Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Vergara (6 Phil. Rep., 281), that, in accordance with articles 837 and 826 of the Code of Commerce, the defendant in an action such as the one at bar cannot be held responsible in damages when the ship causing the injury was wholly lost by reason of the accident, we do not apply it in this case for the reason that the vessel lost was insured and that the\u00a0 defendant collected the insurance.\u00a0 That being the case, the insurance money substitutes the vessel and must be used, so far as necessary, to pay the judgment rendered in this case.<br\/><br\/>In coming to this conclusion we have not lost sight of the case of Place <i>vs<\/i>. Norwich and N. Y. Trans. Co. (118 U. S., 468), in\u00a0 which it was held\u00a0 that, under the provision of the Act of Congress relative thereto, insurance money\u00a0 obtained by reason of the loss of a vessel causing damages, as in the case at bar, was not subject to the payment of the damages sustained by the negligence of the vessel lost by reason of the accident in which the\u00a0 damages occurred.\u00a0 We do not follow that case because we are met in this jurisdiction with article 1186 of the Civil Code, which provides that \"after the obligation is extinguished by the loss of the thing, all the actions which the debtor may have against third persons, by reason thereof, shall pertain to the creditor,\" and with article 2 of the Code of Commerce, which provides that where the Code of Commerce is silent as to the law relating to the matters of which it treats, those matters shall be governed by the provisions of the Civil Code.<br\/><br\/>That said article 1186 is, under the Spanish jurisprudence, applicable to money obtained from the insurance of the thing lost or destroyed, there can\u00a0 be no doubt.\u00a0 (Manresa, vol. 8, 353.)<br\/><br\/>The judgment in this case is, therefore, collectible, but the amount collected cannot exceed the amount of insurance money actually received.\u00a0 The writer of this\u00a0 opinion\u00a0 had\u00a0 doubts of the applicability of article 1186, referred to; but has yielded to the learning of the majority relative to the Roman and Spanish jurisprudence on this point.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Ill), in discussing this question says:<br\/><blockquote>\"The wronged husband being unable in Spain to lodge his complaint for adultery except against both the guilty parties, if both be alive, it is clear that when the woman is dead he can lodge his complaint against the adulterer, for it is only when both are alive that he cannot lodge his complaint except against both the guilty parties at once.\"<\/blockquote>We are of the opinion that the contention of the appellant that the lower court committed an error in proceeding against the survivor alone after the death of his codefendant, after a complaint had been presented against both of them, is not enable.\u00a0 In our opinion no error was committed in respect to said assignment of error.<br\/><br\/>The only other contention made by the appellant is that the evidence adduced during the trial was insufficient to show that he\u00a0 was guilty of the crime charged.\u00a0 The evidence shows that the defendant and appellant had been living in the same house with his codefendant for some weeks or months and that he had been seen having actual illicit relations with his codefendant.\u00a0 The offended party was a tenant of the defendant and appellant.\u00a0 The defendant and appellant admits that he knew that Anastasia de la Torre and the offended party were husband and wife.\u00a0 The evidence clearly shows that the defendant was guilty of the crime charged.<br\/><br\/>The Attorney-General asks that the sentence of the lower court be modified and that the defendant and appellant should be required to pay only one-half of the costs of the lower court.\u00a0 With that suggestion of the Attorney-General we agree.<br\/><br\/>For all of the foregoing reasons the judgment of the lower court is hereby affirmed, with the modification that the defendant be required to pay only one-half the costs of the lower court.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Smith, Jesse George, Pedro Concepcion, and James A. Ostrand, sustained their previous judgment of December 22, merely indicating that the property concerned was sold under <i>pacto de retro<\/i> to the opponent for the sum specified in such previous judgment; and therefore denying the motion made by counsel for the opponent, Virginia Salgado.<br\/><br\/>In the said judgment of December 22 the Honorable Jesse George, judge, ordered the registration of the six parcels of land, the subject matter of case No. 4768, in the name of Severa Poniente, and of the four parcels of land, the subject matter of case No. 4767, in the name of Pedro Montiero, subject to a mortgage for the sum of P2,500 in favor of Virginia Salgado y Acu\u00f1a.<br\/><br\/>On June 27, 1908, Pedro Montiero requested, in case No. 4767, inscription in the property registry, in accordance with law, of four parcels of land situated in the barrio of Buhanginan, of the pueblo of Lilio, Laguna, the respective situation, boundaries, and area of which land were set forth in the written application, in conformity with the technical description and plan accompanying the\u00a0 same, which estate belonged to him absolutely; and at the last assessment was appraised at $960 United States currency, having been acquired by him through inheritance from his parents, Esteban Montiero and Sotera Consul; that there was no encumbrance thereon, or any person who had any right or share therein, except that he had sold it under <i>pacto de retro<\/i> to Benito Javier.<br\/><br\/>On April 27, 1908, Pedro Montiero, in representation of his wife, Severa Poniente, applied, in case No. 4768, for the registration of a parcel of land situated in the barrio of Buhanginan, of the pueblo of Lilio, and also of five other parcels of land in Cabuhayan, of the pueblo of Nagcarlan, Laguna, the location, boundaries, and area of which, respectively, are set forth in detail in the written application, in conformity with the technical description and plans thereto attached; that these parcels had been at the last assessment appraised at $830 United States currency, and had been acquired by her by inheritance from her mother, Casimira Artita; that there was no encumbrance thereon, or any person who had any right or share therein, except that she had sold them under <i>pacto de retro<\/i> to Benito Javier.<br\/><br\/>Javier opposed the foregoing1 applications in both cases, wherefore the judge of the land court refused the registrations requested; but inasmuch as the applicant spouses afterwards repurchased the said parcels of land, the opponent, Benito Javier, withdrew his opposition and asked that titles be issued to the applicants as they had requested.<br\/><br\/>At this stage of the proceedings, counsel for Virginia Salgado, by writings of October 28, 1910, presented in the two aforesaid cases, set forth that his client had acquired by purchase from the spouses Pedro Montiero and Severa Poniente the ten parcels of land, inscription whereof was requested in both cases, and his petition was accompanied by the muniments of title, consisting of a deed of sale executed by the said spouses on October 25, 1910, in behalf of the petitioner, Virginia Salgado, and ratified before a notary public; wherefore he asked for inscription of the lands in the name of Virginia Salgado, and issuance to her of the corresponding title; and in connection with this petition, the court ordered, on November 17, that the petitioner, Montiero, and the opponent, Javier, state before the same, on the morning of December 20, 1910, why the lands concerned should not be registered in the name of Virginia Salgado, as she requested, further providing that should they fail to appear on the day, and at the hour and place specified, they would be declared in general default, Virginia Salgado's application would be granted, and they would be forever estopped from impugning the same and the decree that would be issued.<br\/><br\/>On December 22, 1910, the single judgment aforementioned was rendered in both cases and, in view of the exception entered by counsel for Virginia Salgado and of his motion for a rehearing, the court <i>en banc<\/i> on April 28 decided the opponent's claim by a single ruling in both cases, from which decision an exception was taken, and the corresponding bills of exception were presented for the two cases, approved, and forwarded to the clerk of this court.<br\/><br\/>This case concerns inscription in the property registry of ten parcels of land owned, six of them, by the married woman Severa Poniente, represented by her husband, Pedro Montiero, and the other four by the husband named himself.\u00a0 The first question which arises for solution, before proceeding to determine whether the registration applied for should be granted, is whether the said parcels of land really were or were not sold by the applicant spouses to the opponent, Virginia Salgado, and if so, what the conditions and nature of the sale were, in order to decide whether it is proper to register the property in question in the names of the said Pedro Montiero and Severa Poniente, respectively.<br\/><br\/>When these two persons applied to the Court of Land Registration for the registration of their respective estates, eight parcels of the said land had been sold under <i>pacto de retro<\/i> to Benito Javier, who consequently duly opposed the registration sought; but as soon as the land had been repurchased and Benito Javier had received the greater part of the money, P2,500, which the applicants had obtained from Virginia Salgado, he withdrew\u00a0 his opposition and even asked that the titlessbe issued to the said spouses; and when it was thought that the case would be continued in the Court of Land Registration, Virginia Salgado appeared to oppose the registration requested, alleging that she was the owner of the land and asking that title thereto be issued in her name.<br\/><br\/>It is an unquestionable fact that Virginia Salgado, upon furnishing to the spouses Poniente and Montiero the money needed by them\u00a0 for the repurchase of the lands sold to Benito Javier, required those spouses to execute in her behalf two instruments on the same date, October 25, 1910.\u00a0 In one of them, entitled an absolute sale, the spouses Pedro Montiero and Severa Poniente declare that they sell and convey forever to Virginia Salgado and to her successors in interest, in consideration of the sum of P2,700, the ten parcels of land mentioned, repuchased from Benito Javier.\u00a0 In the other instrument, entitled a conditional sale, Virginia Salgado, as owner of the said ten parcels of land, binds herself to sell them to the said spouses, Montiero and Poniente, in accordance with the agreement made with these latter, within the period comprised between July 1 and December 31, 1925; and that, should the said period elapse without these spouses having exercised their right, they would lose all right of action derived from the present agreement; that the said ten parcels of land should be sold without division; that the price should be the sum of P2,700, the value of all the improvements and crops on the land on the day of the sale, according to expert appraisal, and the amount of all the necessary and needful expenses, including documentation; that, in case the owner should need to sell the said lands, she would have to record the agreement, to insure respect for the rights of the spouses Montiero and Poniente; and that, after the lapse of six months from the date of the instrument, October 25, 1910, the said spouses might negotiate with Virginia Salgado in regard to the sale and to the\u00a0 right conceded them under that agreement.<br\/><br\/>In order to estimate and define the character, nature, and conditions of the two contracts contained in either instrument, as well as to determine the intention of the contracting parties in executing them, the stipulations made by these parties in both documents, which must be held to be one single contract by and between the same parties regarding the conveyance of the ten parcels of land under the conditions of the sale, must be examined and weighed together.\u00a0 Said contracts cannot be viewed as separate and independent, for they both constitute a single contract of sale with the engagement to resell the land, the subject matter of the stipulations, within the term, in the manner and under the conditions set forth in one of said instruments.\u00a0 The private document of December 1, 1910, presented at the trial and not impugned as false, virtually completes the contents of the two instruments executed on the same date by and between the applicants, Montiero and Poniente, and Virginia Salgado, who furnished the money wherewith to repurchase from Benito Javier eight of the ten parcels of land in question.<br\/><br\/>The Court of Land Registration <i>en banc<\/i>, composed of four judges, after consideration of the contents of both instruments, with due regard of the spirit and terms of the contracts, of the manifest intention of the contracting parties, as disclosed by the literal text of both documents, and also of the statements made under oath by Pedro Montiero, not denied or rebutted at the hearing by either Virginia Salgado and her attorney, who was the very notary that authenticated the said two instruments and interpreted their contents to the contracting spouses, who did not know or understand Spanish,' held that the contract made by and between the parties who executed the aforementioned two instruments, drawn up on the same date, was one of sale with <i>pacto de retro<\/i>, and that he stipulation with respect to the excess of the term of ten years fixed for the repurchase of the said ten parcels of land was null and void, inasmuch as, pursuant to article 1508 of the Civil Code, in case of an express agreement the period shall not exceed ten years.<br\/><br\/>Under the aforementioned hypothesis that the conveyance in question was effected under <i>pacto de retro<\/i> it must be determined whether the two spouses who, according to the said instruments, sold the ten parcels of land in litigation are entitled to apply for registration thereof in their names, once the applicants' ownership of the parcels has been unquestionably established.<br\/><br\/>In decision No. 5096, rendered in the case of Mortera <i>vs<\/i>. Martinez (14\u00a0 Phil. Rep., 541), the following syllabus appears:<br\/><blockquote>\"1. Articles 1507 to 1520 of the Civil Code have not been repealed, either expressly or by implication, by subsection (<i>c<\/i>) of section 6 of Act No. 1108 of the Philippine Commission, and therefore the well-known form of contract of sale with <i>pacto de retro<\/i> still subsists.<br\/><br\/>\"2. Subsection (e))of section 6 of Act No. 1108 authorizes the registration of instruments of sale with <i>pacto de retro<\/i> in the registry of property, at the request of the person selling the realty, under the same conditions and in the same manner as mortgages in loan contracts secured by mortgage; but said law has not considered the latter contract as being the same as that of sale with <i>pacto de retro<\/i>, for the reason that the two are entirely different in nature and character.\u00a0 (Art. 1507 et seq., arts. 1857 to 1862 and 1874 et seq., Civil Code; Villarruel <i>vs<\/i>. Encarnacio'n, 5 Phil. Rep., 360.)<br\/><br\/>\"3. The provision which authorizes the registration of an instrument of sale with <i>pacto de retro<\/i> at the request of the seller of the realty is not incompatible with the articles of the Civil Code that deal with such contract; according to article 1510, an action to enforce the redemption of the property sold may be maintained against every possessor who derived his right from the purchaser with <i>pacto de retro<\/i>, for the reason that said action is real in character, and not merely personal; therefore, the right of the owner of the realty coexists with that of the purchaser, and the document may fee entered in the registry.\"<\/blockquote>Hence, according to the principle laid down in the aforecited decision, based on an express provision of law, the vendor of real property under <i>pacto de retro<\/i> may apply for registration thereof, provided, of course, that he record the purchaser's right thereto.<br\/><br\/>Accepting in all other respects the grounds of the judgment appealed from, and deeming the foregoing to be a refutation of the errors assigned to the said judgment by the appellant, the same should be and is hereby affirmed, with the costs against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C, J., Johnson<\/i>, and <i>Moreland, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><i>Trent, J<\/i>., dissents. <\/div>",

and not long afterwards the Constabulary corporal, Florentino Casta\u00f1eda, found in the possession of Felix Mananquil, a son of the defendant Jorge Mananquil, a ring which was also identified by the said Alfonsa Nidera as hers and a part of the articles stolen.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, after the proper preliminary examination had been made, a complaint was filed by the provincial fiscal in the\u00a0 Court of First Instance of Tarlac, on August 1, 1912, charging\u00a0 the defendants and Serapio Enriquez with the crime of robbery <i>en cuadrilla<\/i>, and this cause being instituted, from which Serapio Enriquez was afterwards excluded, the judgment aforementioned was rendered.<br\/><br\/>From the facts above related, fully proved in the present case, sufficient evidence has been adduced to show that the crime of robbery <i>en cuadrilla<\/i> was committed by more than three armed persons on the night of May 5, 1912, in the house of Apolonio Nidera, situated in the pueblo of Tarlac, province of the same name, which\u00a0 crime is provided for and punished by articles 502 and 503, No. 5, in connection with articles 504 and 505, of the Penal Code.<br\/><br\/>Upon the arrest and arraignment of Jorge Mananquil, Pablo Balingit, Severino Guevara, Sixto Romero, and Juan Policarpio, as the suspected perpetrators, together with others of the said crime, they pleaded not guilty; but, notwithstanding their denial, the record discloses satisfactory and convincing proof that, on the night aforementioned, they did assault the house of the aged Apolonio Nidera and, while the majority of the robbers surrounded the house keeping watch, Jorge Mananquil, Pablo Balingit and Severino Guevara entered it and, after having maltreated the owner of the house, the\u00a0 said Apolonio, his wife named Cornelia, and their niece, Alfonsa Nidera, striking them with the flats of their bolos, seized some clothes and other effects, including the sum of P1 belonging to the woman Alfonsa, and P6.50, which Apolonio Nidera\u00a0 had; and that immediately thereafter they left the premises and repaired to the interior of an adjacent wood where they divided among themselves what they had taken.<br\/><br\/>During the commission of the robbery Apolonio and Alfonsa Nidera recognized among the robbers Jorge Mananquil who, it was afterwards ascertained from his codefendants themselves, was the leader of the band.\u00a0 Mananquil stated on the witness stand that his coaccused were in fact in his house on the night in question for the purpose of serenading him and after supper invited him to join in a carousal; that\u00a0 he refused to go and remained at home; that he did not know whether they afterwards committed the robbery, and that if they did he took no part therein.<br\/><br\/>Macario Cabalu and Serapio Enriquez, two men who were in the company of the robbers when the crime was committed and who, upon their exclusion from the complaint, testified as witnesses, corroborated the charges made in the information and swore that the five defendants committed the said robbery under the direction of their leader, Jorge Mananquil.\u00a0 They further testified that it was Mananquil, Balingit, and Guevara who entered the house to perpetrate the robbery, while the others and they, the witnesses, remained as sentries in the vicinity of the building.<br\/><br\/>The other defendants, Sixto Romero, Severino Guevara, Juan Policarpio, and Pablo Balingit, corroborated the testimony given by Jorge Mananquil to the effect that they had met in the latter's house and, after having supper therein, all went to the offended parties' house to commit the robbery under prosecution; and although they stated that they were maltreated by the Constabulary to force them to confess their participation in the crime, nevertheless they admitted their guilt by blaming one another.\u00a0 They were unanimous, however, in declaring that Mananquil was the leader of the band, thus absolutely disproving Mananquil's statement that he took no part in the deed.<br\/><br\/>The justice of the\u00a0 peace testified that he did not coerce or threaten the defendants when they signed in his presence the statements contained in Exhibits B, C, D, E, and F.\u00a0 The Constabulary lieutenant, Manuel Palma, the\u00a0 corporal, Florentino Castaneda, and the private, Pedro Sotto, denied that they made any\u00a0 threats or promises to, or used any violence toward, the defendants at the time the latter made the said sworn statements.<br\/><br\/>The fact that, several days after the robbery, the Constabulary succeeded in ascertaining from Pablo Balingit the whereabouts of some of the articles that were stolen, for Balingit's wife,\u00a0 following the information\u00a0 given by her husband, got from the interior of a wood, adjacent to their house, a shell comb and some clothes belonging to Alfonsa Nidera, who identified them as hers; and the further fact that Corporal Castaiieda found\u00a0 in the possess on of Felix Mananquil, a son of the defendant Jorge Mananquil, a ring that was likewise identified by the said Alfonsa as being one of the articles stolen by the said Jorge Mananquil, is corroboratory evidence of the defendants' guilt as the undoubted perpetrators of the robbery herein charged.<br\/><br\/>So, the evidence of the prosecution and other incriminatory data of record produce conviction beyond all doubt of the defendants' guilt as directly responsible for the crime charged.\u00a0 No impediment to this conclusion may be found in the circumstance that Macario Cabalu and Serapio Enriquez, who testified against the defendants, were in the company of the latter during the commission of the robbery, for the reason that the testimony of these two witnesses, they having been excluded from the complaint, is corroborated by the other evidence found in the record, and the conviction reached of the defendants' guilt is based, not on that testimony alone, but on the whole of the evidence, all conclusive and decisive, and other data furnished\u00a0 by the prosecution.\u00a0 Pablo Balingit and Juan Policarpio withdrew their appeals.<br\/><br\/>In the commission of the crime account must be taken of the presence of aggravating circumstances 15 and 20 of the Penal Code, since it was perpetrated at nighttime and in the dwelling of the offended parties, and these are not offset by any mitigating circumstance; therefore the penalty fixed by law must be imposed upon the defendants in its maximum degree.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment appealed from is found to be in conformity with the law and the merits of the case, and must be and is hereby affirmed; provided, however, that the penalty imposed upon Severino Guevara and Sixto Romero shall be ten years of <i>presidio mayor<\/i>, with a fifth part of the costs againsts each, and as otherwise provided in the judgment appealed from.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Contreras represento a Marasigan en la vista de aquella causa, a cuya terminacion Marasigan fue condenado a catorce anos, ocho meses y un dia de prision y a pagar una multa de P1500. Contra esta sentencia apelo Marasigan a la corte Suprema, en la cual, como hemos dicho, Marasigan estuvo representado por un abogado de oficio. La Corte Suprema revoco la decision del inferior y sobreseyo la causa contra Marasigan.<br\/><br\/>Al ser condenado Marasigan en el Juzgado de primera Instancia, Eco firmo de nuevo la fianza a favor de Marasigan y consiguio otro fiador. Al serle concedida la libertad a Marasigan durante la pedencia de su asunto en la Corte Suprema, Eco trato tambien con Contreras de que se en cargara del asunto en apelacion. Contreras vino a Manila como Diputado y Eco, a peticion de Marasigan, vino tambien a Manila en el mes de Diciembre de 1910, o Enero de 1911, al objeto de consultar con Contreras en lo relativo al asunto de Marasigan, entonces pendiente en apelacion. A su llegada aqui, se entrevisto con Contreras y este dio a entender a Eco que el sr. Lukban se encargaria de la causa de Marasigan. Que se celebro tal compromiso resulta evidente de una manera clara del Exhibit 1 que es un documento de Marasigan en que acusa recibo de una carta de lukban en que pide se le remitan P200 para pagar la copia de las declaraciones de los testigos. Despues de que Eco volvio a Paracale, Marasigan le entrego la carta de Lukban y Eco escribio a Contreras en cuanto al asunto. Ni Eco ni Marasigan supieron nada\u00a0 mas en cuanto a la causa de este ultimo hasta el 1.o de Abril de 1911, en cuya fecha Eco recibio el siguiente telegrama de Contreras:<br\/><br\/>\"Diga Marasigan que su causa ha sido sobreseida por la Corte Suprema.\"<br\/><br\/>Al recibir esta noticia Masrasigan llamo a\u00a0 varios de sus amigos, incluso Eco, y compro cierta cantidad de vino para celebrar el resultado.Esto daba fin a todas las actuaciones contra Marasigan, quedando tan solo en pie la cuestion de pagar a los abogados. Hasta este fecha Contreras, abogado de Marasigan, solo habia recibido P40 por sus servicios, en los cuales estaban incluidas varias consultas en Nueva Caceres, un viaje desde Nueva Cacertes a Daet, la vista de la causa en este lugar y la intervencion que tuvo en la apelacion.<br\/><br\/>Eco declaro que cuando estaban celebrando las gratas noticias trasmitidas por el telegrama antes mencionado, llamo la atencion de Marasigan hacia el hecho de que lo mejor seria que viera la manera de pagar a contreras sus honorarios que el, Eco, habia garantizado. No consta haberse hecho nada mas hasta Agosto de 1911, en que Eco marcho a Nueva Caceres para examinarse de juez de paz. Aqui se encontro con Contreras, y segun lo declarado por ambos, le pago P100 a cuenta de Marasigan, remitiendo P100 por correo desde Paracale, en Septiembre del mismo ano. estos dos pagos, juntamente con los P40 abonados por Marasigan, ascendian a P240, que era la cuenta total de Contreras. En los P200 que Eco se comprometio a garantizar no estaban incluidos los P40 pagados por Marasigan. Tambien en Agosto, y mientras Eco estaba en Nueva Caceres, Marasigan hizo que se entregara a Juan eco, hermano del apelante, el carabao en cuestion en pago parcial de los adelantos hechos, o que se hicieran, a su cuenta.<br\/><br\/>Cuando Marasigan se entero de que habia estado representado en la Corte Suprema por abogado de oficio acuso a Eco de haber obtenido la posesion del cqarabao por haberle falsamente manifestado que el, Eco, habia gastado P200 para utilizar los servicios de un abogado que representara a Marasigan en la Corte Suprema. Practicaronse ciertas investigaciones por el Fiscal Provincial de Ambos Camarines en cuanto al particular y en Febrero de 1912, no habiendo sido trasmitido el carabao a Eco en forma legal, fue devuelto a Marasigan. En 26 de Abril de 1912 se presento le querella que constituye la base de esta causa contra Eco, por estafa del carabao.<br\/><br\/>Para probar que Eco habia manifestado que inviritio P200 en la apelacion de Marasigan, la acusacion presento tres testigos, a saber: Felipe Marasigan, Crisanto Oco y Pedro Veluz. Examinando detenidamente lo declarado por estos tres testigos se vera que toda la causa descansa virtualmente en la declaracion, no corroborada de Marasigan, el querellante. en la pagina 4 de las pruebas testificales Marasigan dijo:<br\/><blockquote><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"> <tbody><tr valign=\"top\"> <td width=\"10%\">\"R.<\/td> <td width=\"90%\"> <div align=\"justify\">El me requirio tres veces el pago de los P200.

Oco trato de corroborar lo dicho por Marasigan en cuanto a la peticion del carabao, pero no determino el tiempo o el lugar en que la peticion se hizo y, por ultimo, declaro que el carabao valia P200, al paso que Marasigan jamas pretendio que el animal valiera mas de P100.<br\/><br\/>El testigo Pedro Veluz declaro en parte como sigue:<br\/><blockquote><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"> <tbody><tr valign=\"top\"> <td width=\"10%\">\"P.<\/td> <td width=\"90%\"> <div align=\"justify\">Recuerda Vd. haber estado presente en un requirimiento hecho por eco a Marasigan de P200?<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>R.<\/td> <td> <div align=\"justify\">Si senor.<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>P.<\/td> <td> <div align=\"justify\">Para que eran los P200 que requiria Eco de Marasigan?<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>R. <\/td> <td><div align=\"justify\">Para pagar al abogado de la Corte Suprema.<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>P.<\/td> <td> <div align=\"justify\">Que mes poco mas o menos ha ocurrido ese requirimiento?<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>R.<\/td> <td> <div align=\"justify\">9 de Septiembre como a las 6:30.<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>P.<\/td> <td> <div align=\"justify\">De que ano?<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>R.<\/td> <td> <div align=\"justify\">1911.<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>P.<\/td> <td> <div align=\"justify\">9 de Septiembre a las 6:30 en punto?<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>R.<\/td> <td> <div align=\"justify\">Si senor.<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>P.<\/td> <td> <div align=\"justify\">Vd. vio en su reloj?<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>R.<\/td> <td> <div align=\"justify\">Si senor, siempre llevo.<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>P.<\/td> <td> <div align=\"justify\">No es verdad que Vd. declaro en el Juzgado de paz en la investigacion preliminar que no sabia nada de los P200 hasta despues de salir de la casa que es cuando le dijo a Vd.

Marasigan dice que esto ocurrio en Marzo y que Eco entonces le manifesto que habia sido absuelto por la Corte Suprema. La falsedad de esta manifestacion de Marasigan se prueba de dos maneras --Primero, la causa de los Estados Unidos vs. Marasigan, R. G. No. 5989 no fue fallada por esta Corte sino el 16 de Marzo de 1911, enviandose por correo la notificacion correspondiente a Ramon salinas y al Fiscal General, en 17 de Marzo. Se devolvio la causa el escribano del Juzgado de Primera Instancia de Ambos Camarines en 17 de Marzo y este acuso recibo de ella en 29 del mismo mes. Sin duda Contreras fue notificado por el Escribano poco despues, e inmediatamente envio el telegrama de 1.o de Abril a Eco. Segundo, que el abogado Lukban escribio a Marasigan pidiendole P200 para pagar una copia de las declaraciones. En cuanto a este carta declararon Contreras y Eco y es hecho admitido por Marasigan. Eco declaro que al regresar a Paracale en Febrero de 1911 contesto a esta carta en nombre de Marasigan. Esto esta admitido. Resulta evidente que tal contestacion habria sido absurda si Eco hubiera llevado la notificacion de que Marasigan habia sido absuelto por la Corte Suprema.<br\/><br\/>Mas palpable falsedad que la anterior es la tentativa de Marasigan en negar que se le hubiera ensenado un telegrama de Contreras anunciando su absolucion. Dice:<br\/><blockquote>\"El (Eco) no me enseno telegrama alguno. Como podia ensenar un telegrama si todos estaban borrachos?\"<\/blockquote>Marasigan admite que estaban embriagados y pregunto entonces como era posible que, estandolo, vieran el telegrama. Si las pruebas acreditan algun punto por modo concluyente es el de que la causa de la embriaguez fue el haber recibido ese telegrama. La prueba testifical de autos demuestra que al recibirse el telegrama, Marasigan pidio a Eco que le adelantara P200 para Contreras. Ademas, de autos resulta que cuando Marasigan fue juzgado por falsificacion de documento publico, le acompanaron a Daet Eco y Agapito G. Fierro. En Daet, Eco y Marasigan vivieron juntos y eco declaro en el juicio. Marasigan niega ahora que Eco le acompanara a Daet: dice que no sabe por que estuvo alli y no recuerda que Eco declarara en el juicio. Y ademas Marasigan dijo que Eco consiguio el carabao en cuestion en Junio de 1911. Diego de Villa, que cuidaba del carabao, declaro que Marasigan se lo entrego para que lo cuidara en Mayo y que se lo llevo Juan Eco en virtud de ordenes de Maraasigan, en Agosto de 1911. El testigo dijo ademas que Marasigan le instruyo para que declarase que el carabao fue llevaddo en Junio. aunque en realidad lo fue en Agosto. esto lo corrobora Juan Eco, el cual dice que al sacar el carabao, obraba en virtud de ordenes de Marasigan. La fecha en que ocurrio este hecho la fijan ambos testigos coincidiendo con la fiesta de Bacabolani. Lo dicho por ellos esta corroborado por el acusado y por la carta dirigida por Marasigan a esta Corte, escrita en 17 de Agosto, en que manifiesta que el acusado le reclama P200. Si el carabao hubiera sido entregado en Junio, conforme declaro Marasigan, la cantidad que quedaria por pagar en agosto hubiera sido tan solo P100.<br\/><br\/>Es hecho admitido que el acusado intervino en favor de Marasigan cuando este fue acusado de falsificacion. Fue fiador suyo cuando fue detenido y ademas cuando se interpuso la apelacion. Se la dio un poder para arreglar lo relativo a su defensa ante la Corte Suprema, en cuyo apoderamiento Marasigan hace constar especialmente que es pobre y que no puede pagar honorarios de abogado. Eco trato con Contreras la cuestion de la defensa de Marasigan y se comprometio a responder a Contreras del pago de sus honorrarios. Sobre este punto Contreras declaro como sigue:<br\/><blockquote>\"El Sr. Eco siempre me estaba hablando sobre ese asunto, y llegue a hablar una vez con el Sr. Lukban en el comite de la Asambles, preguntandole sobre ese asunto, y el me contesto que habia escrito a Marasigan.\"<\/blockquote>Que Eco pago en realidad P200 a Contreras es hecho probado por el testimonio directo y positivo, tanto de Contreras, como de Eco. Que Contreras trato al acusado como el representante de Marasigan, es cosa demostrada concluyentemente por el hecho de que Contreras envio as Eco el telegrama en que anunciada la absolucion de marasigan. eco no supo hasta Diciembre de 1911 que Marasigan no habia sido defendido en la Corte Suprema por un abogado de parte.<br\/><br\/>En vista de las razones expuestas y despues de examinar detenidamente todo lo actuado, hemos encontrado muy poca dificultad en llegar a la conclusion de que la acusacion no ha podido demostrar la culpabilidad del apelante, por lo cual se revoca la sentencia apelada y se absuelve al apelante, con las costas de oficio.<br\/><br\/>Trascurrridos diez dias desde la notificacion de esta decision dictese sentencia a tenor de lo resuelto, y diez dias despues devuelvase la causa al Juzgado de su origen para los efectos a que en derecho hubiere lugar.<br\/><br\/>Asi se ordena.<br\/><br\/><i>Arelleno, Gomez, Moreland<\/i> y <i>Trent.<\/i> <\/div>",

of such persons shall be jointly and severally liable in such action.\"<\/blockquote>The plaintiffs contend that the ordinance under which they were convicted is illegal.\u00a0 The illegality of the ordinance is the only question which we can consider.\u00a0 (Section\u00a0 6, Act No. 1627.)\u00a0 If said ordinance is valid and enforceable then they were properly convicted, for they admitted their guilt, and the appeal must be dismissed.\u00a0 If, upon the other hand, said ordinance is invalid, they were improperly and illegally convicted and are entitled to have the sentence of the lower court annulled.<br\/><br\/>Upon the question presented we have received very little assistance from the briefs presented.\u00a0 Decisions in\u00a0 this court in important cases are often delayed for the simple reason that little or no assistance is furnished in the briefs.<br\/><br\/>The principal contention of the appellants is that, inasmuch as the general law (Act No. 1757) provides a punishment for the acts for which they have been punished, the municipality (of Malabon) was without authority to adopt the ordinance in question, and that it is therefore invalid.<br\/><br\/>We shall first examine the charter of the said municipality (the general Municipal Code, Act No. 82 with its amendments) for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not it had authority to adopt said ordinance.\u00a0 If we conclude that it had authority, we shall then consider the effect which Act No. 1757 had upon such authority.\u00a0 It may be noted, however, in the beginning, that the general powers of municipalities have been uniformly announced by law writers as well as by the courts to be <i>\"such powers as are expressly given by the charter and such other powers as are necessarily implied from such express powers.\"<\/i>\u00a0\u00a0 The same rule in effect and substance may be stated in another way, to wit:\u00a0 <i>\"A municipality can exercise such powers only as have been either expressly or by necessary or fair implication conferred upon it, or such as are essential to its declared objects and purposes.\" <\/i><br\/><br\/>Act No. 82 was adopted by the United States Philippine Commission, January 31,1901.\u00a0 It was a general act for the organization of municipalities in the Philippine Islands.\u00a0 Said Act (No. 82) with its amendments constitutes the general charter of all the municipalities in the Philippine Islands, except the city of Manila and the settlements of the non-Christian tribes.\u00a0 Said Act contains the general and special powers of such municipalities.\u00a0 Section 39 of said Act contains the provisions relating to the general powers of the councils of said municipalities.\u00a0 Paragraph (<i>u<\/i>) of said section 39 gives the councils express authority <i>\"to provide against the evils of gambling, gambling houses, and disorderly houses of whatever sort\"<\/i>\u00a0 Subsection (<i>dd<\/i>) of said section 39 authorizes the councils to \"fix penalties for the violation of ordinances, with the provision that no single penalty shall exceed a fine of P200 or imprisonment for six months, or both.\"<br\/><br\/>The municipality of Malabon, by the ordinance in question, <i>prohibited<\/i> the gambling game known as <i>jueteng<\/i>, and fixed, as the maximum\u00a0 penalty for a violation of the same, a fine of P200.\u00a0 Is the provision in the charter which authorizes the municipal councils to provide against the \"<i>evils<\/i> of gambling, etc.,\" broad enough in its terms to justify said council in adopting ordinances <i>prohibiting<\/i> certain gambling games?<br\/><br\/>While the law writers and the courts have written long and learnedly pro and con upon the extent of such authority, we are of the opinion that authority granted to provide against the <i>\"evils<\/i> of gambling, etc.,\" is sufficiently broad and comprehensive in its purpose to authorize the municipality to prohibit absolutely certain classes of gambling, if, in the opinion of the council, such legislation is the most effective means of providing against the \"<i>evils<\/i> of gambling, etc.\"\u00a0 We believe that the general legislative authority intended to authorize the councils of municipalities to exercise a wide\u00a0 discretion in the\u00a0 method of providing against the \"<i>evils<\/i> of gambling, etc.,\" even to the extent of prohibiting gambling\u00a0 absolutely.\u00a0 The method of providing against the \"<i>evils<\/i> of gambling, etc.,\" was expressly left to the wisdom of the councils of the said municipalities, to be exercised in accordance with the conditions and exigencies of the particular case.\u00a0 It seems clear, therefore, to us that the general charter (Act No. 82 and its amendments) of the municipalities of the Philippine Islands is sufficiently broad in its provisions to authorize the municipality of Malabon, and all others, to adopt ordinances prohibiting the gambling game of <i>jueteng<\/i> and to provide a punishment, within the limitations of said charter, for a violation of said ordinances.\u00a0 We are strengthened in our conclusion by the fact that the Philippine Legislature, by\u00a0 Act No. 2212, in amending Act No. 1757, provided expressly that:<br\/><blockquote>\"The provisions of this section [13 of Act No. 1757, as amended by\u00a0 Act No. 2212] shall be applicable in cases of conviction of the violation of municipal ordinances <i>prohibiting gambling<\/i>.\"<\/blockquote>Thus it appears clearly by legislative interpretation, that it was intended, by subsection (<i>u<\/i>) of section 39 of Act No. 82, to\u00a0 authorize municipalities to <i>prohibit gambling<\/i> in the exercise of their power to provide against the \"evils of gambling, etc.,\" if they so desired.<br\/><br\/>Having reached the conclusion that the municipality had authority to adopt the ordinance in question it becomes necessary to examine the effect which Act No. 1757 had upon such authority, which Act also prohibited the playing at and the conducting of the game known as <i>jueteng<\/i> (sec. 7) and provided a punishment for a violation of said law.\u00a0 Act No. 1757 was enacted and became a law October 9,1907.\u00a0 Not only did Act No. 1757 prohibit the gambling game of <i>jueteng<\/i> and provide a punishment for its violation, but it also provided that \"all Acts and parts of Acts inconsistent or in conflict with said Act, shall\u00a0 be repealed.\"\u00a0 Are the provisions of subsection (<i>u<\/i>) of section 39 inconsistent or in conflict with the provisions quoted above of Act No. 1757?\u00a0 Is a law which authorizes the municipalities of the Philippine Islands to <i>prohibit<\/i> by proper ordinances the gambling game of <i>jueteng<\/i> in conflict with the provisions of a general law which also prohibits the said gambling game of <i>jueteng<\/i>? Did the Legislature by Act No. 1757 intend to repeal the authority granted to the municipal councils to provide against the \"<i>evils<\/i> of gambling?\"\u00a0 If that is true, then the municipalities are now without authority to control gambling in any manner whatever, for that is the only provision in the charter (Act No. 82) relating to the subject.\u00a0 Municipal charters are general or special laws of the state (or central government) granting to the people of certain well-defined sections of the state the right of local self-government.\u00a0 While the state grants to such localities the right of self-government in local affairs, it does not thereby deprive itself of the right also, when the occasion demands, to interfere and enforce its own laws.\u00a0 The state, in granting to the municipality the right of local self-government, does not thereby deprive itself of its general powers throughout the length and breadth of the state.\u00a0 The charter may be either modified, amended, or repealed whenever the state deems it necessary or advisable.\u00a0 The municipality is simply the agent of the state and is subject, at all times, to its control.\u00a0 It does not seem to follow, simply because the state has seen fit to legislate upon certain subjects and to punish certain acts, that it thereby withdraws the right theretofore granted to its municipalities (its agents).\u00a0 Of course it is not contended that the municipality may adopt ordinances repugnant to the general laws of the state or in derogation thereof.\u00a0 In the present case the ordinance in question was adopted under the authority and in harmony with the express authority granted by the state and is, moreover, in exact accord with the subsequent law of the state.<br\/><br\/>The question which we are considering is not a new one.\u00a0 It has been discussed by law\u00a0 writers and the courts many times.\u00a0 The question of the right of the municipalities, under their charter, to adopt ordinances upon questions which the state has already or subsequently legislated upon, has been discussed by the courts of last resort in practically every State in the Union, with varying results.\u00a0 The question has also been\u00a0 discussed by the Supreme Court of the United\u00a0 States.<br\/><br\/>We shall examine the jurisprudence upon this question to ascertain, if possible, what the weight of authority is.<br\/><br\/>First, What is the opinion of the eminent law writers?\u00a0 Mr. McQuillin, one of the latest\u00a0 and most eminent of the authorities\u00a0 upon the question of municipal corporations, after a lengthy discussion and a careful examination of the authorities upon the question whether the same act may be made an offense against the state and the municipal corporations, says:<br\/><blockquote>\"The general doctrine is supported by the weight of judicial authority that, an act may be made a penal offense under the statutes of the state, and that further penalties may be imposed for its commission or omission by municipal ordinance.\"<\/blockquote>He cites in support of his conclusion decisions from a large majority of the States of the United States, as well as of the Supreme Court of the United States.\u00a0 (McQuillin on Municipal Corporations, vol. 2, section 878.)<br\/><br\/>Mr. McQuillin adds: \"But to authorize such ordinances, the local corporation (municipal corporation) must possess sufficient charter\u00a0 power, and such power must be exercised in the manner conferred and consistent with the statutes of the State.\"<br\/><br\/>Mr. Justice Thomas M. Cooley, one of the most eminent law writers of Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence, in discussing the question before us says:\u00a0 \"Municipal by-laws must be in harmony with the general laws of the State, and with the provisions of the municipal charter.\u00a0 Whenever they come in conflict with either, the by-law (ordinance) must give way.\u00a0 The charter, however, may expressly or by necessary implication exclude the general laws of the State on any particular subject and allow the corporation to pass local laws at discretion, which may differ from the rule in force elsewhere (in the State), but in these cases the control of the State is not excluded if the legislature afterwards sees fit to exercise it; nor will conferring a power upon a corporation (municipal) to\u00a0 pass by-laws (ordinances) and impose a penalty for the regulation of any specified subject necessarily supersede the State law on the same subject, but the State law and the by-law may both stand together, if not inconsistent.\u00a0 Indeed, an act may be a penal offense under the laws of the State, and further penalties, under proper legislative authority, be imposed for its commission by municipal by-laws (ordinances) and the enforcement of the one would not preclude the enforcement of the other.\"\u00a0 (Cooley's Constitutional Limitations, 6th ed., p. 239.)<br\/><br\/>Judge Cooley adds that \"such is the clear weight of authority, though the decisions are not uniform.\"<br\/><br\/>Judge Cooley quotes from the\u00a0 opinion in the case of Rogers <i>vs<\/i>. Jones (1 Wend., N. Y., 238, 261), where it is said:\u00a0 \"But it is said that the by-law (ordinance) of a town or corporation is void, if the legislature have regulated the subject by law.\u00a0 If the legislature have passed a law regulating certain things in a city, I apprehend the corporations are not thereby restricted from making further regulations. Cases of this kind have occurred and never been questioned on that ground;\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 The legislature have imposed a penalty of $1 for servile labor on Sunday.\u00a0 The corporation of the city of New York have passed a by-law imposing the penalty of $5 for the\u00a0 same offense.\u00a0 As to storing gunpowder in New York, the legislature and the corporation (of the city of New York) have each imposed the same penalty.\u00a0 Suits to recover the penalties have been sustained under the corporation law.\u00a0 It is believed that the ground has never been taken that there was a conflict with the State law.\"<br\/><br\/>Judge Dillon, in his work on municipal corporations (5th ed.), which has long been recognized as a standard, after a lengthy discussion and citation of authorities, fully recognizing the conflict which exists, quotes approvingly from Judge Cooley the following:\u00a0 \"Although the decisions are not uniform, the clear weight of authority is that the same act may constitute an offense both against the State and the municipal corporation and both may punish it without violating any constitutional principle.\"<br\/><br\/>An examination of all the other authorities, including the work of Mr. Charles B. Elliott, formerly a member of this court, shows that they have all arrived at the same conclusion which Mr. Justice Cooley, Judge McQuillin, and Judge Dillon reached.<br\/><br\/>Second.\u00a0 Passing from a consideration of what the law writers have said upon the question before us, to the decisions of the courts of last resort of the different States of the Union, we find the following results;<br\/><br\/>(1) <i>State of Alabama<\/i>.\u2014One of the leading cases upon the question which we are discussing is that of the Mayor of Mobile vs. Allaire (14 Ala.,\u00a0 400).\u00a0 This case is cited by practically every author who has written upon the question.\u00a0 The court in this case, after a statement of the facts, said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The object of the power conferred by the charter, and the purpose of the ordinance itself, was not to punish for an offense against the criminal justice of the country, but to provide a mere police regulation for\u00a0 the enforcement of good order and quiet within the limits of the corporation.\u00a0 So far as an offense has been committed against the public peace and morals, the corporate authorities have no power to inflict punishment, and we are not\u00a0 informed that they have attempted to arrogate it.\u00a0 It is altogether immaterial whether the state tribunal has interfered and exercised its powers in bringing the defendant before it to answer for the assault and battery, for whether he has there been punished or acquitted is alike unimportant.\u00a0 The offenses against the corporation and the state, we have seen, are distinguishable,\u00a0 and wholly disconnected, and the prosecution at the suit of each proceeds upon a different hypothesis.\u00a0 The one contemplates the observance of the peace and good order of the city; the other has a more enlarged object in view\u2014the maintenance of the peace and dignity\u00a0 of the state.\"<\/blockquote>See also Mobile <i>vs<\/i>. Rouse, 8 Ala., 515.<br\/><br\/>(2) <i>State of Arkansas<\/i>.\u2014In the state of Arkansas a very interesting decision is found in the case of Van Buren <i>vs<\/i>. Wells (53 Ark., 368; 22 Am. St. Rep., 214).\u00a0 This\u00a0 case is frequently cited by law writers and the courts upon the question which we are discussing.\u00a0 The question presented was the validity of a city ordinance prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons, where the State had a law covering the same-offense.<br\/><br\/>Mr. Justice Battle, speaking for the court, said:\u00a0 \"Municipal corporations 'are bodies politic and corporate, vested with political and legislative powers for the local civil government and police regulations for the inhabitants of the particular districts included in the boundaries of the corporations.'\u00a0 In some respects they are local governments established by law, to assist in the civil government of the country.\u00a0 They are founded, in part, upon the idea that the needs of the localities for which they are organized, 'by reason of the density of population, or other circumstances, are more extensive and urgent than those of the general public in the same particulars.'\u00a0 Many acts are often far more injurious, while the temptations to do them are much greater in such localities than in the state generally.\u00a0 When done in such localities they are not only wrongs to the public at large, but are additional wrongs to the corporations.\u00a0 To suppress them when it can be done, and, when there is a failure to do so, to punish the guilty parties, in many cases, form a part of the duties of such corporations.\u00a0 Many of them can and ought to be made penal by the incorporated cities and towns, although they are already made so by the statute.\"<br\/><br\/>Justice Battle, in the course of his opinion, quotes approvingly from Judge Thomas M. Cooley, as follows:\u00a0 \" 'Indeed, an act may be a penal offense under the laws of the State, and further penalties, under proper legislative authority, be imposed for its commission by municipal by-laws, and the enforcement of the one would not preclude the enforcement of the other.\u00a0 Such is the clear weight of authority, though the decisions are not uniform.'\u00a0\u00a0 (Cooley, Const. Lim., 6th ed., 239.)\"<br\/><br\/>(3) <i>State of California<\/i>.\u2014Many cases have come before the court of last resort in the State of California in which has been discussed the question of he right of a municipality by ordinance to make an act a crime, which has already been made a crime by the general statutes of the State. (<i>Ex parte<\/i> Chin Yan, 60 Cal., 78; <i>Ex parte<\/i> Casinello, 62 Cal., 538; <i>Ex parte<\/i> Wolters, 65 Cal., 269; <i>In re<\/i> Sic, 73 Cal., 142; <i>Ex parte<\/i> Johnson, 73 Cal., 228; <i>Ex parte<\/i> Campbell. 74 Cal., 20;

and second, that said ordinance was in conflict with the constitution of the State.\u00a0 In reply to that argument, Mr. Justice Thornton, speaking for the court, said:<br\/><blockquote>\"But it is said that this order is in conflict with the law of the State on the same subject, and we are referred to section 330 of the Penal Code.\u00a0 It is said that this section does not make visiting a gaming house a penal offense.\u00a0 This may be granted, and still there is no conflict, and for the sufficient reason that section 330 of the Penal Code does not make such act an offense, does not refer to it at all, and the order does.\u00a0 The State Legislature can in the future legislate on the subject, and both the statute then passed and the ordinance may stand together.\u00a0 We find nothing in the order to conflict with the section of the Penal Code referred to.\"<\/blockquote>It will be noted that in the State of California there exists a constitutional provision which provides that:\u00a0 \"Any county, city, town, or township may make and\u00a0 enforce within its limits such local police, sanitary, and other regulations as <i>are not in conflict with general laws\"<\/i><br\/><br\/>In the case of <i>In re<\/i> Sic (<i>supra<\/i>) the defendant was convicted of the crime \"of assembling for the purpose of smoking opium, etc.,\" in violation of the provisions\u00a0 of an ordinance of the city of Stockton.\u00a0 The case finally reached the supreme court and the validity of the\u00a0 ordinance was brought into question upon the ground that it was in conflict with the State law, contrary to the provisions of the constitution of the State.\u00a0 The supreme court found that the ordinance was in conflict with the State law, and was therefore void under the provisions of section 11, article 11 of the State Constitution,\u00a0 The supreme court added, however, the following:<br\/><blockquote><i>\"It will be observed that we only hold that there is a conflict where the ordinance and the general law punish precisely the same acts.\u00a0 We do not wish to be understood as holding that the sections of the ordinance which make criminal other acts not punishable under the general law are void because the legislature has seen fit to legislate upon the same subject\"<\/i><\/blockquote>The right of a municipality, under proper charter authority, to adopt ordinances punishing other offenses analogous to offenses already covered by the State law is found in the case of <i>Ex parte<\/i> Johnson (<i>supra<\/i>).\u00a0 See also <i>Ex parte<\/i> Boswell (<i>supra<\/i>).<br\/><br\/>In the case of <i>Ex parte<\/i> Hong Shen (<i>supra<\/i>), the defendant was convicted under a city ordinance of the city of San Francisco, which attempted to-regulate the sale of opium in said city.\u00a0 The question came before\u00a0 the supreme court of the State upon the ground that the ordinance was void for the reason that it was in conflict with the State law.\u00a0 In deciding the case, Mr. Justice Paterson, speaking for the court, said:<br\/><blockquote>\"It will be seen from the provision above referred to, that the State and the municipality have both legislated upon the same subject.\u00a0 The State has endeavored to regulate the sale of certain poisons, by requiring the seller to make certain inquiries and keep a certain record of facts, but it is not provided that opium cannot be sold except upon prescription of a physician furnished by the purchaser.\u00a0 In this respect the order of the board of supervisors goes beyond the requirement of the statute, and the question is whether or not the board have the right to so legislate upon the subject.<br\/><br\/>\"There is no doubt that the municipal by-laws may stand, if not inconsistent with the State laws, and that the by-law is not necessarily void simply because the legislature has regulated the same subject by law;

City of Denver, 17 Colo., 302; 29 Pac, 518.)\"<\/blockquote><i>In re<\/i> Murphy, 128 Cal., 29.<br\/><br\/>One of the best illustrations of what the supreme court of California regards as constituting a conflict between a city ordinance and a State law is found in the case of <i>In re<\/i> Hoffman (155\u00a0 Cal., 114).\u00a0 In that case Hoffman was arrested and convicted\u00a0 of a violation of an ordinance of the city of Los Angeles.\u00a0 The ordinance fixed the standard of milk which might be sold in the city.\u00a0 The ordinance required the milk offered for sale in the city should contain:\u00a0 Total milk solids, 12.5 per cent, by weight; butter fat, .3.5 per cent, by weight; water, 87.5 per cent, by weight.\u00a0 Subsequent to the adoption of the ordinance by the city of Los Angeles, the State adopted a law which attempted to prohibit adulteration and deception in the sale of dairy products.\u00a0 The State statute required that it should\u00a0 be unlawful for any person to produce, manufacture, or prepare for sale, or to sell or offer for sale or have on hand for sale, any milk that is adulterated, within the meaning of the State law. The State law attempted to fix the standard for milk.\u00a0 The State law provided that milk should contain not less than 3 per cent of milk fat; and not less 8.5 per cent solids, not fat.\u00a0 It will be noted that under the city ordinance 12.5 per centum of the milk was required to be solids, while under the State law the requirement for solids was only 11.5.\u00a0 It will be seen, therefore, that the requirement under the State law was 1 per cent less than the requirement under the city ordinance; or, in other words, the city required one per cent more of milk solids as a standard for milk to be sold in the city of Los Angeles than was required under the State law.\u00a0 Hoffman contended that the city ordinance was void for the reason that it was in conflict with the State law.\u00a0 In discussing that question Mr. Justice Henshaw, speaking for the supreme court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The constitution (Art. XI, sec. 11) empowers a city to make and enforce within its limits, 'all such local police, sanitary, and other regulations as are not in conflict with general laws.'\u00a0 It is insisted that the State, having thus provided a standard for pure milk, the attempt of the city ordinance to vary that standard creats a conflict in the law, with the necessary result that the ordinance must fall.<br\/><br\/>\"Undoubtedly if such a conflict exists, the ordinance must give way to the paramount law of the State.\u00a0 But does such a conflict\u00a0 exist?\u00a0 For, if it does not, then it is well settled that the mere fact that the State in the exercise of the police power has made certain regulations, does not prohibit a municipality from exacting additional requirements.\u00a0 So long as there be no conflict between the two, and so long as the requirements of the municipal by-law are not in themselves pernicious as being unreasonable or discriminatory, both will stand.\u00a0 (<i>Ex parte<\/i> Hong Shen, 98\u00a0 Cal., 681, 33 Pac, 799; <i>In re <\/i>Murphy, 128 Cal., 29, 60 Pac, 465; Bellingham <i>vs<\/i>.

City of Denver (17 Colo., 302), Mr. Justice Helm said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The legislature\u00a0 may undoubtedly delegate to municipal corporations power to adopt and <i>enforce by-laws or ordinances on matters of special local importance, even though general statutes exist relating to the same subjects<\/i>.\u00a0 An ordinance must be authorized and must not be repugnant to a statute in force over the same territorial area.\u00a0 But if there be no other conflict\u00a0 between the provisions of the statute and ordinance save that they deal with the same subject, both may be given effect.\u00a0 The resulting or correlative doctrine is\u00a0 now\u00a0 too uniformly established to admit of serious question that the same act may constitute two offenses, viz, a crime against the public law of the State and also a petty offense against a local municipal regulation.\u00a0 The weight of authority also fairly sustains the view\u00a0 that a prosecution\u00a0 and punishment for one of these offenses is no\u00a0 bar to a proceeding for the other; though, if it be not so provided by statute, every fairminded judge will, when pronouncing\u00a0 a judgment in the second transaction or proceeding, consider the penalty already\u00a0 suffered.\u00a0 Since the act constitutes two distinct offenses against separate jurisdictions, it is analogous to those cases where the same act is punishable under a Congressional statute and also under a State law.\u00a0 The offenses being different there is no violation of the constitutional inhibition of putting one twice in jeopardy for the same offense.\u00a0 These views have already, in substance, been sanctioned by this court.\u00a0 (Hughes <i>vs<\/i>.

Von Glahn (88 Ga., 405).\u00a0 In this case Von Glahn was the keeper of a saloon and a retail liquor dealer.\u00a0 He was charged in the municipal court with the offense of keeping open his saloon on Sunday.\u00a0 Upon arraignment his defense was that the municipal court was without jurisdiction to try him, on the ground that the offense charged against him was a State offense and that the court, therefore, had no jurisdiction to try him.\u00a0 His plea of jurisdiction was overruled and after trial he was found guilty and sentenced to pay a fine of $100 or to work ninety days on the public work.\u00a0 He declined to pay the fine.\u00a0 Upon an\u00a0 effort to execute the sentence, he sued out a writ of habeas corpus, alleging that he was being illegally detained, upon the ground that the municipal court was without jurisdiction to try and sentence him.\u00a0 The case finally reached the supreme court where it was held that Von Glahn \"had no right to be discharged on habeas corpus, based on the alleged want of jurisdiction.\"<br\/><br\/>It appears in this case that in 1857 the legislature of the State of Georgia passed an Act which provided that the city council of the city of Augusta was empowered to pass all ordinances in relation to keeping open tippling houses on the Sabbath day in said city, as well as ordinances in relation to lewd houses or houses of ill fame, for the purpose of suppressing them.\u00a0 At the time this power was conferred upon the city council of the city of Augusta, there existed a general penal statute, operative throughout the State, also making it a misdemeanor to keep open a tippling house on the Sabbath day.\u00a0 In accordance with such legislative authority, the city council adopted an ordinance providing a punishment for keeping open tippling houses on the Sabbath day.\u00a0 The defendant, Von Glahri, was arrested and tried in the municipal court as above indicated.<br\/><br\/>After a statement of the facts, as above indicated, Mr. Justice Simmons, speaking for the court, said:<br\/><blockquote><i>\"The question to he determined is, whether the legislature had power to authorize the ordinance.\u00a0 Could the legislature authorize\u00a0 a municipal corporation to punish, as an offense against the municipality, an act punishable under a general law as an offense\u00a0 against the State<\/i>?\u00a0 There is no decision of this court in which the question, has been directly adjudicated.\u00a0 Elsewhere it has frequently arisen, and has almost as frequently been decided in the affirmative.\u00a0 The following are cases in which the power is recognized or upheld:\u00a0 Mobile <i>vs<\/i>.

S., 338.)<br\/><br\/>(15) <i>State of Maryland.<\/i>\u2014One of the best considered cases which we have found is that of Rossberg <i>vs.<\/i> State (111 Md., 394.)\u00a0 In that case Rossberg was prosecuted by the city of Baltimore for the violation of an ordinance known as the \"cocaine ordinance,' which prohibited the sale, furnishing, giving away, or having in possession cocaine and kindred substances, etc., and which provided certain penalties for its violation.\u00a0 At the time of the passage of said ordinance there was in force in the State of Maryland a general statute which forbade selling, furnishing or giving away of cocaine and of the same substances and compounds mentioned in said ordinance, and which general statute provided certain penalties for its violation.\u00a0 The penalty provided by said ordinance was a fine of not less than $100 nor more than $500, with imprisonment for not less than six nor more than twelve\u00a0 months.\u00a0 The penalty provided by the State law was a fine of from $25 to $50 for the first offense; $50 to $100 for the second offense, and $100 to $200, with imprisonment in jail for not more than six months, for the third and subsequent offenses.<br\/><br\/>The defendant, Rossberg, was convicted in the lower courts and the case finally reached the supreme court.\u00a0 Mr. Justice Pearce, speaking for the court, after an extended discussion of the powers of the city of Baltimore under its charter, said:<br\/><blockquote>\"But passing from this\u00a0 consideration the real and substantial \ncontention of the appellant is twofold:\u00a0 First, that a penal ordinance \npunishing the same act as that punished by State law, is invalid and \nvoid; and, second, that even if this cannot be\u00a0 sustained as broadly \nstated, that such an ordinance is invalid where it is inconsistent with \nthe laws of the State upon the same subject, and that in this case the \nordinance in\u00a0 question is inconsistent with the State law punishing the \nsame act punished\u00a0 by the ordinance.<br\/><br\/>\"In Cooley's Constitutional Limitations (5th ed., p. 241) the author says:\u00a0 The State law and the by-law may both stand together if not inconsistent.\u00a0 Indeed, an act may be a penal offense under the laws of the State, <i>and further, penalties,<\/i> under proper legislative authority, be imposed for its, commission by municipal by-laws, and the enforcement of the one would not preclude the enforcement of the other.\u00a0 Such is the clear weight of authority, though the decisions are not uniform.'<br\/><br\/>\"In McQuillin on Municipal Ordinances, a recent elaborate textbook, it is said:\u00a0 'It is entirely competent for the Legislature to confer in express terms such powers as will enable the local corporation to declare by ordinance any given act an oifense against its authority, notwithstanding such act has been made by statute a public offense and a crime against the State\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 and further penalties may be imposed for its commission or omission by municipal ordinance.'<br\/><br\/>\"In 28 Cyc, 697, it is said: 'Unless it is prohibited by some express constitutional or statutory provision, by the great weight of authority, municipal corporations may, by ordinance, prohibit\u00a0 and punish acts which are\u00a0 also prohibited and punishable as misdemeanors under the general statutes of the State or which may involve a common law offense;\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 <i>such ordinances after much strenuous contention are now generally recognized as valid<\/i><br\/><br\/>\"This statement of the law is supported by an overwhelming array of decided cases, collected in the notes to the works above cited, many of which we have laboriously examined, but we do not deem it necessary to review them here.\u00a0 The view taken in these cases is tersely expressed in Monroe <i>vs.<\/i> Hardy (46 La. An., 1232), which was a prosecution by the mayor of a city for a fine imposed by ordinance upon crap shooting, which was prohibited also by the State law, and the court said:\u00a0 'In certain classes of offenses there may be concurrent powers in the State and in municipal authorities to prohibit them.\u00a0 <i>The decisions on this point have been so numerous and uniform in upholding this doctrine that it has passed into an elementary principle in the textbooks.'\"<\/i><\/blockquote>Mr. Justice Pearce continues:<br\/><blockquote>\"It follows from what we have thus far said that municipal\u00a0 authorities may be given concurrent power with the State to punish certain classes of offenses, and that which first obtains jurisdiction of the person of the accused may punish to the extent of its power; and further that the ordinance is not made invalid by the\u00a0 mere fact that the State law and the ordinance provide in terms for distinct prosecutions for the same act.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>\"But the appellant further contends that this ordinance is invalid under the express terms of the legislative grant, because it is inconsistent with the law of the State, and this supposed inconsistency is found in the fact that the penalties prescribed in the State law are different from those of the ordinance, the latter being heavier, and not distinguishing, as the State law does, between first, second, and third offenses.<br\/><br\/>\"But all the text writers already cited herein unite in declaring that <i>further and additional penalties<\/i> may be imposed by ordinance, without creating inconsistency.\u00a0 The true doctrine, in our opinion, is concisely stated in 28 Cyc, 701, as follows:\u00a0 'Such ordinances must not directly or indirectly contravene the general law.\u00a0 Hence ordinances which assume directly or indirectly to permit acts or occupations which the State statutes prohibit, or to prohibit acts permitted by statute or constitution, are under the familiar rule for validity of ordinances uniformly declared to be null and void.\u00a0 Additional regulation by the ordinance does not render it void.'\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 Wyse <i>vs.<\/i> Jersey City Police Commrs.\u00a0 (68 N. J. L., 127).\"<\/blockquote>The reason for the foregoing rule is found to be well stated in the case of Van Buren vs. Wells (53 Ark., 368) :<br\/><blockquote><i>\"Municipal corporations are in some respects local governments\u00a0 established by law to assist in the civil government of the\u00a0 country.\u00a0 They are founded, in part, upon the idea that the needs of the localities for which they are organized, 'by reason of the density of population, or other circumstances, are more extensive and urgent than those of the general public in the same particulars.\u00a0 Many acts are often far more injurious, while the temptations to do them are much greater, in such localities than in the State generally.\u00a0 When done in such localities they are not only wrongs to the public at large, but are additional wrongs to the corporations.<\/i>\u00a0 To suppress them when it can be done, and, when there is a failure to do so, to punish the guilty parties, in many cases form a part of the duties of such corporations.\u00a0 <i>Many of them can and ought to be made penal by incorporated cities and towns, although already made so by the statute.<\/i>\u00a0 It sometimes becomes necessary for them to do so in order to accomplish the objects of their organization.\"<\/blockquote>This language is especially applicable to the nefarious sale, and having in possession for unrestricted sale, of cocaine and other deadly drugs, so largely used in this day as a substitute for ordinary stimulants or intoxicants, and a good example of the application of the principles above stated is found in the case of Mon Luck <i>vs.<\/i> Sears (32 L. R. A., 738).<br\/><br\/>(16) State of Michigan.\u2014A very interesting and important case is found in the State of Michigan.\u00a0 In the case of People <i>vs.<\/i> Hanrahan (75 Mich., 611), the defendant was arrested and convicted by the municipal court of the city of Detroit, Michigan, of the violation of a city ordinance which prohibited the keeping of houses of ill fame, and was sentenced to pay a fine of $500.\u00a0 Later he filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the supreme court, asking that the sentence of the municipal court be declared null upon the ground that said court was without authority to impose said sentence under the ordinance.<br\/><br\/>In 1887 the legislature of the State of Michigan enacted a law which provided that:\u00a0 \"Every person who shall keep a house of ill fame, resorted to for the purpose of prostitution or lewdness, and every person who shall solicit, or in any manner induce, a female to enter such house for the purpose of becoming a prostitute, or shall by force, fraud, deceit, or in any like manner procure a female to enter such house for the purpose of prostitution or of becoming a prostitute, shall be deemed guilty of a felony, and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by imprisonment in the State prison not more than five years, or in the county jail not more than one year, or by fine not exceeding one thousand dollars, or by both such fine and imprisonment, in the discretion of the court.\"<br\/><br\/>In 1883 the legislature of the State of Michigan granted to the city of Detroit a charter, which, among other provisions, contained the following:\u00a0 \"The common council may prohibit, prevent, and suppress the keeping and leasing of houses of ill fame or assignation or for the resort of common prostitutes, disorderly houses, and disorderly groceries.\u00a0 It may restrain, suppress, and punish the keepers thereof, and the owners and lessors of such premises.\"<br\/><br\/>Section 54 of said charter provided that:\u00a0 \"The common council shall have power to provide for the imprisonment and confinement in houses of correction, at hard labor or otherwise, of all persons liable to be imprisoned or confined under this act or any act relating to said city, or any ordinance of the common council.\"<br\/><br\/>Under the authority granted in said charter the common council of the city of Detroit passed an ordinance entitled \"Disorderly houses,\" section 1 of which provided that:\u00a0 \"No person shall keep within the limits of the city of Detroit any house of ill fame, house of assignation, or house for the resort of common prostitutes,\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 or shall in any manner contribute to the support, carrying on, or keeping of any such house or place.\"<br\/><br\/>Section 4 of said ordinance provided that:\u00a0 \"Any person who shall violate any of the provisions of this ordinance shall be punished by a fine not to exceed $500, and costs of prosecution; and the offender may be sentenced to be imprisoned in the house of correction until the payment thereof:\u00a0 <i>Provided, however<\/i>, That the term of such imprisonment shall not exceed six months.\"<br\/><br\/>It will be noted in reading the quotations from said law and the ordinances adopted under the charter of the city of Detroit that they both cover the same subject and that the punishment provided for by said law was different from the punishment provided for by the ordinance.\u00a0 Mr. Justice Champlin, speaking for the court in a very interesting opinion, said:<br\/><blockquote>\"Under our constitution the power to enact laws is vested in the legislature.\u00a0 But the legislature is authorized to confer upon organized townships, incorporated cities and villages, and upon the board of supervisors of the several counties, such powers of a local, legislative, and administrative character as they may deem proper.\u00a0 The object was to secure to local municipalities the power of self-government in matters of purely local concern.<br\/><br\/>\"The nature and extent to which the legislature may confer this legislative power upon municipalities within their territorial limits is entirely within the discretion of the legislature.\u00a0 In exercising the power conferred of passing such laws of a local character as the wants of a particular community call for, it must happen that very many of the lesser crimes and misdemeanors <i>which are punished under general laws<\/i> must come under the police regulations of such municipalities, because they are more liable to be perpetrated by the vicious class who congregate in cities than elsewhere; and the peace and good order of the municipality require that they should be more promptly and summarily dealt with than they could be under the State law.<br\/><br\/>\"I have no doubt that it was competent under the constitution for the legislature to confer upon the common council of the city of Detroit the authority contained in the sections of the charter above quoted.\u00a0 The ordinance appears to have been authorized by the\u00a0 charter.<br\/><br\/>\"That the suppression\u00a0 of houses of ill fame in a city is a matter of great local concern there can be no question.\u00a0 That it can be dealt with more effectively by the city authorities than\u00a0 by the State, I think is plain.\u00a0 It would be contrary to the facts to assert that houses of ill fame in the midst of a city are not dangerous and revolting nuisances.\u00a0 They contaminate the morals of society, and render respectable neighborhoods obnoxious to decent people by their presence.\u00a0 Their suppression demands the closest attention of the guardians of the peace, and the most stringent police regulations to accomplish the object.<br\/><br\/>\"These considerations, and others that might be suggested, show that the power conferred upon the common council was wise, and should be sustained if there be no constitutional objection.\"<\/blockquote>Mr. Justice Champlin closes his opinion by saying:\u00a0 \"I think the ordinance in question is valid, and that the charter provisions authorizing its enactment were not repealed by implication, but are in force, and valid.\u00a0 It follows that the conviction must be affirmed.\"<br\/><br\/>Other cases in the State of Michigan supporting the same doctrine are:\u00a0 Wayne County <i>vs.<\/i> Detroit (17 Mich., 390); Fennell <i>vs.<\/i> Bay City (36 Mich., 186); People <i>vs.<\/i> Detroit White Lead Works (82 Mich., 471).<br\/><br\/>(17) <i>State of Minnesota.<\/i>\u2014The question which we are discussing has come before the supreme court of Minnesota many times.\u00a0 In the case of the State <i>vs.<\/i> Lee (29 Minn., 445), the defendant was indicted and tried in the district court for the offense of keeping a house of ill fame.\u00a0 Upon the trial in the district court the defendant offered to prove, under a plea of former conviction, that she had been duly convicted of the same offense under an ordinance of the city of St. Paul.\u00a0 The court refused to admit the evidence upon the ground that such former conviction was no bar to a subsequent prosecution by the State.\u00a0 The case finally reached the supreme court where it was held that prosecution and conviction, under an ordinance of the city of St. Paul, for keeping a house of ill fame in said city constitutes no bar to a prosecution for the same act under the general laws of the State.\u00a0 (Mayor, etc., <i>vs.<\/i> Allaire, 14 Ala., 400;

The city then appealed to the supreme\u00a0 court.\u00a0 In the supreme court various defenses were made.\u00a0 Among others, it was alleged by the defendant that, inasmuch as the State law punished the malicious destruction of property and so forth, the ordinance of the city of Brownville was null and void.\u00a0 Upon that question Mr. Chief Justice Lake, speaking for the court, said:<br\/><blockquote>\"It was urged\u00a0 upon our attention, with considerable earnestness, that, inasmuch as at the time this offense was committed, there\u00a0 was a general statute in force on the subject of malicious mischief, this should be taken as embodying the entire legislative will on this subject, and therefore that it would be reasonable to presume, not only that no further regulation was contemplated, but\u00a0 that it would be altogether unnecessary and unreasonable.\u00a0 But I think no such presumption exists.\u00a0 Surely, if the general police laws of the State were considered ample by the\u00a0 legislature, for the good and efficient government of the people in every portion of the State, it would hardly have been worth while to establish any local municipal governments whatever.\u00a0 I think the reasonable presumption is rather the reverse of this, and that the people of cities and villages, for various reasons at once apparent to anyone, require much more stringent regulations for their government, than do those of the more sparsely settled districts of the State.\u00a0 In\u00a0 a city, property of every description is much more liable to the depredations, and individuals are far more frequently subjected to petty annoyances, at the hands of the evil disposed, than in the country, and it is the business of these local governments to provide all reasonable protection against them.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"But, even as to property falling within the purview both of the statute and the ordinance, the former does not supersede the latter, for it is a principle of very general application, that the same act may constitute an offense both against the State and the municipal government, and that both may punish it without infringing any constitutional right,<br\/><br\/>\"For these reasons, I conclude that this is a valid ordinance, for the violation of which the defendant was liable to the punishment which it imposes.\"<\/blockquote>While said case was disposed of upon another issue, the above quotation clearly indicated the views of the supreme court of the State of Nebraska.<br\/><br\/>(21) <i>State of New Jersey<\/i>.\u2014A very interesting decision is announced by the supreme court of the State of New Jersey, speaking through its chief justice, Mr. Hornblower.\u00a0 The case is that of State <i>vs.<\/i> Plunkett (18 N. J. L., 5)\u00a0 The case involved the question whether a city ordinance making it an indictable offense for selling liquor in the city of Newark was valid in view of the fact that there existed a State law upon the same question.\u00a0 In the course of the decision Mr. Chief Justice Hornblower said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The doctrine contended for by the counsel for the defendant would sweep from the jurisdiction of the State courts, a very large portion of offenses against the laws of the State.\u00a0 Selling ardent spirits without license, keeping disorderly houses, gambling, riots, nuisances; larcenies committed at fires; selling unwholesome meats in markets, and a variety of other crimes, if committed within the city of Newark, and some other incorporated towns in this State, would cease to be indictable and punishable in our State courts.\u00a0 Such a result must not be reached by any doubtful construction.\u00a0 It involves a question of too serious import to the sovereignty of the State, and the peace and well-being of the community at large, to be settled upon technical principles, or to be deduced by mere implication of law,\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 The two statutes may well stand together, and it is sufficient in this case to say, that if the defendant had taken out a license under the common council, to sell ardent spirits by the small measure, he could not have been indicted; but if 'without license for that purpose first had and obtained from some authority legally competent to grant such license, he did sell ardent spirits by the small measure, then he violated the State law and was liable to be indicted.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 The opinion of this Court therefore is, and they so advise the lower court, that the defendant is liable to indictment and conviction for the offense charged against him; and that they ought, upon his plea of guilty, to proceed to judgment according to law.\"<\/blockquote>In the case of Howe <i>vs.<\/i> Plainfield (37 N.

C, 427; 50 L. R. A., 725).\u00a0 It appears from the facts that the defendant was tried and convicted in the municipal court of the city of Greenville for a violation of a city ordinance relating to gambling, was found guilty, and sentenced to pay a fine of $50 or be imprisoned for a term of thirty days.\u00a0 The case finally reached the supreme court of the State.\u00a0 The contention of appellant was that the ordinance was in conflict with the State law, and was therefore null and void.\u00a0 Mr. Chief Justice Mclver, in answering the contention of the appellant, said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The State legislation upon the subject, even if construed as contended for by the appellant, and the municipal legislation here in question, can both stand together, and there is no conflict whatever.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 <i>Indeed, it is well settled in this State, at least, that the same act may be made an offense both against the State and the municipal law.<\/i>\u00a0 As that great jurist, Judge Cooley, expresses it in his work on Constitutional Limitations:\u00a0 'Indeed, the same act may constitute an offense both against the State and the municipal corporation, and both may punish it without violation of any constitutional principle.'\u00a0 And in a note he says, 'Such is the clear weight of authority, though decisions are not uniform,' and proceeds to cite the cases.\u00a0 In one of the cases which he cites (Rogers <i>vs.<\/i> Jones, 1 Wend., 261), we find the following language, which is so appropriate to the case in hand that we quote it:\u00a0 'If the legislature have passed a law regulating as to certain things in a city, I apprehend the corporation are not thereby restricted from making further regulations.'\u00a0 (Cross <i>vs<\/i>.

Douglass (8. S.

S.,371, 390).\"<\/blockquote>In the foregoing quotations from the jurisprudence established by the different States, an effort has been made to show what in fact is the weight of authority upon the question of the right of a municipality, under proper charter grant of power, to adopt ordinances making acts offenses which are also offenses under the penal laws of the State.\u00a0 We believe that the result shows that Mr. Justice Cooley was right when\u00a0 he said:<br\/><blockquote>\"An act may be penal offense under the laws of the State and further penalties, under proper legislative authority, may be imposed for its commission by municipal by-laws, and the enforcement of the one cannot preclude the enforcement of the other.\u00a0 Such is the clear weight of authority, though the decisions are not uniform.\"<\/blockquote>No cases have been found, and it is believed that there are none, where the right of a municipality, under proper charter grants, has been denied.\u00a0 In several States where the right has been denied, it has been found that there existed some statutory or constitutional inhibition against it.<br\/><br\/>It is not contended that a city may, by ordinance, punish all offenses usually punished under the penal laws of the State.\u00a0 In the first place cities are limited by their charter powers, and in the second place, the charter powers usually limit the city ordinances to offenses which disturb the peace, morals, or good order within the limits of the municipality.<br\/><br\/>The cases which we have examined in which the ordinances have been sustained even though\u00a0 they\u00a0 related to offenses already punished under the general laws of the State, relate to the following classes of offenses:\u00a0 Bawdy-houses; houses of ill fame; lewd women on the streets; public drunkenness; liquor selling; selling liquor on Sunday; keeping open saloons on Sunday; gaming; gambling; keeping gambling houses; billiard tables; selling lottery tickets; nuisances; immoral pictures; disturbing the peace; assault; assault and battery; carrying concealed weapons; animals running at large; obstructing highways; regulating bay windows; fast and careless driving in the streets; regulating porters in and about railway stations; selling and keeping for sale impure or unwholesome foods, including milk, etc.; tippling houses; visiting houses for the purpose of smoking opium; visiting houses where opium is smoked, or used upon the human body; visiting houses of ill fame.<br\/><br\/>The question of the right of a municipality to adopt an ordinance making an\u00a0 act an offense which is already an offense under the general laws of the state has come before this court on several occasions.\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Chan-Cun-Chay, 5 Phil. Rep., 385; U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Flemister, 5 Phil. Rep., 650; U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Gavieres, 10 Phil. Rep., 694; U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Vallejo, 11 Phil.

S. <i>vs<\/i>. Flemister, 5 Phil. Rep., 650, 207 U. S., 372; U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Gavieres, 10 Phil. Rep., 694, 220 U. S., 338.)<br\/><br\/>The question, however, which we are discussing was directly decided\u00a0 by this court in the case of U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Espiritusanto (23 Phil. Rep., 610).\u00a0 In that case this court.\u00a0 speaking through Mr. Justice Torres, said:<br\/><blockquote>\"A municipal council acts within its powers, as conferred by organic law, in enacting an ordinance prohibiting the game called <i>jueteng<\/i> within the limits of the municipality.\u00a0 The Municipal Code (Act No. 82, sec. 39) authorizing municipalities to provide against the evils of gambling should be understood to include the power to prohibit games of chance and to make necessary regulations to exterminate the evils arising from the playing of prohibited games.\u00a0 A municipal ordinance prohibiting the game of <i>jueteng<\/i> is, furthermore, in conformity with the provisions of Act No, 1757, inasmuch as <i>jueteng<\/i> is included\u00a0 in the games of chance that are absolutely prohibited by the general law.\"<\/blockquote>We might have based our whole conclusion in the present case upon the decision in the case of United States <i>vs<\/i>. Espiritusanto.\u00a0 We have, however, cited the jurisprudence of the different courts of last resort in the United States and the well-known authors who have written upon this subject simply as confirmatory of the soundness of the doctrine announced in that case.<br\/><br\/>There is another question involved in the present case which the attorney for the appellant has not suggested nordiscussed.\u00a0 It is: In view of the fact that the offense under the ordinance is precisely the same offense under the general law, can the defendants be punished both by the municipal authorities and by\u00a0 the state authorities?\u00a0 This question is suggested by reason of the provisions of the Philippine Bill, which provides that a party cannot be placed twice in jeopardy for the same offense.\u00a0 In view of the fact, however, that the question\u00a0 has not been discussed in the present case, neither by the attorney for the appellant nor by the attorney for the appellee, we defer the discussion of that question for consideration in the case of United States <i>vs<\/i>. Jose et al.\u00a0 (R. G. No. 7118), where the question has been directly raised by the parties.<br\/><br\/>The appellant contends that Act No. 1757, which attempted to prohibit the gambling game of <i>jueteng<\/i>, repealed the power granted to the municipality by the general charter (Act No. 82) to provide against the evils of\u00a0 gambling, etc.\u00a0 Act No. 1757 does not attempt to expressly repeal that power of the municipalities.\u00a0 If said act does not repeal the power granted under Act No. 82, it is done by implication.\u00a0 <i>Implied repeals are not favored by the law.<\/i>\u00a0 A statute does not, by implication, repeal a prior one, unless there is such positive repugnance between them that they cannot stand together.\u00a0 (Arthur<i> vs.<\/i> Homer, 96 U. S., 137; Chew Heong <i>vs.<\/i> U. S., 112 U. S., 550; Beals <i>vs.<\/i> Hale, 4 How., U. S., 36; Ex parte Yerger, 8 Wallace, 85.) Implied repeals are seldom admitted, except on the grounds of repugnancy and never when the former act can stand together with the new act.\u00a0\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Langston, 11&amp; U. S., 389; Louisville Water Co. <i>vs.<\/i> Clark, 143 U. S., 1; Lau Ow Bew <i>vs.<\/i> V. S., 144\u00a0 U. S., 47; Lem Moon Sing <i>vs.<\/i> U. S., 158 U. S., 538; Ward <i>vs.<\/i> Race Horse, 163 U.

S., 513; Mills <i>vs.<\/i> Russell, 116 U S., 13.)<br\/><br\/>It might also be stated as a legal proposition that a second law on the same subject does not, without a repealing clause or negativing words, repeal a former one, unless its provisions are so clearly repugnant as to imply a negative (Welch <i>vs.<\/i> Cook, 97 U.\u00a0 S., 541), unless it clearly apptars that the two laws cannot stand and be enforced together.\u00a0 The repugnancy between two statutes which would justify the courts in holding that one repeals the other should be very clear, especially when the latter law does not attempt, by express terms, either in the title or the body of the law, to repeal the former.\u00a0 Mr. Justice Cooley, in his work on Constitutional Limitations (6th ed., p. 182), says:<br\/><blockquote><i>\"This rule has peculiar application and force in the case of laws, of special and local application, which are never to be deemed repealed by general legislation, except upon the most unequivocal manifestation of intent to that effect<\/i> (Cass <i>vs.<\/i> Dillon, 2 Ohio State, 607; Fosdick <i>vs<\/i>. Perrysburg, 14, Ohio State), 472; McKenna <i>vs<\/i>. Edmundstone, 91 N. Y., 231; Clark <i>vs<\/i>. Davenport, 14 Iowa, 494; Covington <i>vs<\/i>. E. St. Louis, 78 III, 548.)\"<\/blockquote>In the present case, Act No. 82, while in fact it was a general law providing for the organization of all of the municipalities of\u00a0 the Philippine Islands, except Manila and those situated in the non-Christian tribes, nevertheless it was a special law in the sense that it applied only to municipalities.\u00a0 It is not believed that the Legislature in adopting Act No. 1757 intended in the remotest way to repeal or modify any of the provisions of the general municipal code (Act No. 82).\u00a0 And, moreover, we believe that there exists positive proof in the subsequent Acts of the Legislature of that fact.\u00a0 Act No. 1757 was\u00a0 adopted on October 9, 1907.\u00a0 On the 3d of February, 1913, the Philippine Legislature, by Act No. 2212, amended Act No. 1757, providing that the court should order the confiscation of money, articles, instruments, appliances, and devices used in gambling, in case the defendants were found guilty.\u00a0 This same Act (No. 2212) contained the provision that said amendment should be applicable in cases of conviction of a violation of municipal ordinances prohibiting gambling.\u00a0 We have, therefore, an express recognition by the Legislature of the right of municipalities to prohibit gambling by municipal ordinance.\u00a0 We are clearly convinced that the Legislature did not, by Act No. 1757, repeal or modify in any way whatever the provisions of Act No. 82, relating to the power of municipalities to provide against the evils of gambling, etc.<br\/><br\/>In the absence of some inhibition, statutory or constitutional, against the legislative department, the courts have no right to dictate what laws shall be adopted by that department of the Government, and what laws shall not be adopted, so long as a well-defined public policy is not violated.\u00a0 This court, in discussing that question in the case of Case <i>vs.<\/i> Board of Health (24 Phil. Rep., 250), said:<br\/><blockquote>\"If a municipal ordinance is adopted in conformity with the powers conferred upon the municipality, the court will not pronounce it unreasonable, illegal, and void, unless and until it is shown to have contravened or violated some fundamental law.\u00a0 The question of the validity of every statute is first determined by the legislative department of the Government and the courts will resolve every presumption in favor, of its validity.\u00a0 Courts are not justified in adjudging statutes invalid in the face of the conclusions of the Legislature, when the question of its validity is at all doubtful.\u00a0 The courts will assume that the validity of a statute was fully considered by the legislature when adopted.\u00a0 Courts will not presume a statute invalid unless it clearly appears that it falls within some of the inhibitions of the fundamental laws of the state.\u00a0 The wisdom or advisability of a particular statute is not a question for the courts to determine.\u00a0\u00a0 If a particular statute is within the constitutional power of the Legislature to enact it should be sustained whether the courts agree or not in the wisdom of the enactment.\u00a0 If the statute covers subjects not authorized by the fundamental laws of the land, or by the constitution, then the courts are not only authorized but are justified in pronouncing the same illegal and void, no matter how wise or beneficent such legislation may seem to be.\u00a0 Courts are not justified in measuring their opinions with the opinion of the legislative\u00a0 department of the Government, as expressed in statutes, upon questions of the wisdom, justice and advisability of a particular law.\u00a0 In exercising the high authority conferred upon the courts to pronounce valid or invalid a particular statute, they are only the administrators of the public will, as expressed in the fundamental law of the land.\u00a0 If an Act of the Legislature is to be held illegal, it is not because the judges have any control over the legislative power, but because the Act is forbidden by the fundamental law of the land and because the will of the people, as declared in such fundamentallaw, is paramount and must be obeyed, even by the Legislature.\u00a0 In pronouncing a statute illegal, the courts are simply interpreting the meaning, force, and application of the fundamental law of the state.\"<\/blockquote>It has been suggested that by the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of United States <i>vs.<\/i> Grafton, the doctrine announced in the cases of United States <i>vs<\/i>. Chan-Cun-Chay, United States <i>vs<\/i>. Flemister, United States <i>vs<\/i>. Gavieres, United States <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>. Vallejo, and Miranda <i>vs.<\/i> Smith, has been overruled.\u00a0 There might be some weight in that suggestion if it were not for the fact that the Supreme Court of the United States affirmed the decision of this court in the cases of United States <i>vs<\/i>. Flemister and United States <i>vs<\/i>. Gavieres, after the decision in the Grafton case, thereby\u00a0 clearly indicating that there was no intention in the Grafton case to modify the doctrine relating to the power of municipalities as announced in the Flemister and Gavieres cases.\u00a0 And, moreover, in the case of United States <i>vs<\/i>. Gavieres (10 Phil. Rep., 694; 220 U. S., 338) the Supreme Court of the United States expressly mentions and discusses the Grafton case, which shows that there was no oversight of the jurisprudence involved in the different cases.\u00a0 The effect of the Grafton case was simply that a person, under the laws of the Philippine Islands, could not be punished twice for the same offense.\u00a0 It will be remembered that Grafton was acquitted by a court-martial of the crime of murder.\u00a0 He was again arrested and tried by the Court of First Instance for exactly the same offense.<br\/><br\/>From all of the foregoing, our conclusions are: <ol> <li>That the charter (Act No. 82) of the municipality of Malabon fully authorized the adoption of the ordinance in question.\u00a0 (Ordinance No. 1, series of 1910.)<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>That, inasmuch as the charter (Act No. 82) fully authorized the ordinance in question, the same was valid, even though the state (the central government) subsequently enacted a general law upon the same subject, making the same act an offense.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>That Act No. 1757 neither expressly nor by implication repealed the authority granted, in Act No. 82, to the municipality of Malabon, to adopt the ordinance in question.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>That there is no statutory or constitutional provision in force in the Philippine Islands, prohibiting the legislative department of the Government from authorizing municipalities to adopt ordinances, within their charter grants, making certain acts offenses, which tend to disturb the peace and good order within their limits, and to corrupt the morals of their\u00a0 people, even though such acts are also made offenses by the general law.<\/li><\/ol>For all of the foregoing reasons, it is hereby ordered that the appeal be dismissed and that the cause be returned to the court from whence it came for the execution of the sentence heretofore rendered by the lower court, with costs against the appellants.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

S. <i>vs<\/i>. Go-Siaco, 12 Phil. Rep., 490; U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Hung Chang, 134 Fed. Rep., 19, and cases there cited; Nishimura Ekiu <i>vs<\/i>. U. S., 142 U. S., 651; Fong Yue Ting <i>vs<\/i>. U. S., 149 U. S., 698; The Japanese Immigrant Case, 189 U. S., 86.)<br\/><br\/>There is, however, one defect in the proceedings, to which counsel invites our attention, which justifies and necessitates the reversal of the order issued by the trial judge, and the return of the record for a new trial.\u00a0 No record of the evidence submitted in the court below has been brought here, and it is impossible for us, therefore, to review the findings of the trial judge, or to render a judgment either affirming or reversing the judgment based thereon.<br\/><br\/>Ordinarily, in accordance with the practice adopted in this court, we would, under such circumstances, issue appropriate orders for the completion of the record by\u00a0 uniting thereto a\u00a0 certified copy of the evidence taken at the hearing in the court below.\u00a0 But it is very clear that the issuance of such orders in the case at bar would be a vain formality, as the record clearly discloses that if any evidence was in fact submitted at the hearing, no written record thereof was preserved.\u00a0 The Solicitor-General in his brief admits or rather asserts \"that no notes of the testimony were taken in the court below,\" and we are satisfied not only from his admission, but from a careful review of the whole record brought before us, that if any testimony was in fact taken, it was not reduced to writing, and that it cannot therefore be certified to this court for review in accordance with the practice in this jurisdiction.<br\/><br\/>In the discussion of this case in the body of the court, a number of questions were raised as to the proper procedure in appeals in cases of this kind.\u00a0 Questions arose as to the right of the defendant in deportation proceedings to an appeal to this court; as to whether if the right to appeal exists, the record should be brought here by bill of exceptions, or by an appeal perfected as was that in the case at bar; as to whose duty it is to bring up the written evidence in cases of this kind; and as to whether, in any event, this court is charged with the review of the evidence taken at the hearing in the court below, for the purpose of determining whether the facts as found by the trial judge are or are not supported by the evidence.<br\/><br\/>We may admit at once that the provisions of Act No. 702 touching deportation proceedings are so incomplete as to render it necessary in determining the\u00a0 proper steps to be adopted in a given case to look for guidance to the general rules of practice and\u00a0 procedure as prescribed by law and followed in this jurisdiction, having in mind the nature of the proceedings and the purpose and object for which, under the law, these proceedings may be instituted.\u00a0 In the case of the United States <i>vs<\/i>. Lee Chiao (23 Phil. Rep., 543) we pointed out that while this Act (No. 702) provides for the making of the arrest of the persons who may be made parties defendant in deportation proceedings, \"there is no provision whatever relating to the sworn complaint upon which the warrant of arrest may be issued\" or as to the persons who may make, the sworn complaint.\u00a0 Nevertheless, this court, by a unanimous vote, declared that such a complaint must be presented, and at the same time, it definitely determined the persons who are authorized to present it.\u00a0\u00a0 As will be seen by an examination of that decision, we arrived at our conclusions in that case from a consideration of the very nature of the proceedings, and of the purpose and intent of Congress in authorizing the local Legislature to make provision for such proceedings.\u00a0 In like manner, in the case at bar, it becomes necessary to supply the deficiencies or omissions of the Act, touching the manner in which the testimony is to be taken and appeals perfected from orders of deportation issued in the Courts of First Instance.<br\/><br\/>Section 18 of Act No. 136, by virtue of which the courts in these Islands were organized, provides that:<br\/><blockquote>\"The Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction of all actions\u00a0 and special\u00a0 proceedings properly brought to it from Courts of First Instance, and from\u00a0 other tribunals from whose judgment the law shall specially provide an appeal to the Supreme Court.\"<\/blockquote>The proceedings had in deportation cases are special proceedings in Courts of First Instance, and since there is no provision giving to those courts exclusive jurisdiction and expressly denying the right of appeal, there can be no doubt that this court has appellate jurisdiction over all such proceedings when properly brought before it.<br\/><br\/>There is nothing in the statute (Act No. 702) which would indicate the intention of the Legislature to deprive this court of appellate jurisdiction in proceedings of this nature.\u00a0 It is true that the statute does not specifically prescribe the form in which the appeal should be perfected; but in the absence of clear and unmistakable language, such as that used in connection with election contest proceedings in the statute providing therefor, such an omission falls far short of being sufficient to deprive this court of its general appellate jurisdiction, conferred in general terms in the Organic Act, No. 136.<br\/><br\/>Having arrived at the conclusion that this court has appellate jurisdiction over these proceedings (which, indeed is not seriously questioned), the next question for consideration is the mode whereby they are to be brought to this court for review.\u00a0 The cases which have been brought before us heretofore, both on appeal by the defendants and by the Government, have come here substantially in the manner prescribed in criminal cases, that is to say by the certification of the whole record in the court below to this court for review.\u00a0 But it is contended that since these deportation proceedings are not in fact criminal proceedings, they should be brought here by bills of exception in the manner and form prescribed for civil actions in the Code of Civil Procedure.\u00a0 We cannot agree with this contention.<br\/><br\/>While it is true that it has been repeatedly held by the Federal courts of the United States and by this court that deportation proceedings are not criminal actions, it must also be remembered that they are not ordinary civil actions in the sense in which that word is used in those provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure prescribing the procedure in the court below and the steps whereby such actions are brought to this court for review by bills of exception.\u00a0 They are rather in the nature of special administrative investigations instituted and conducted by the Government with a view to ascertain whether under the law one alleged to be a Chinese laborer, residing within the Islands, is or is not entitled to remain there under the law, wherein a judicial hearing is provided for the ascertainment of certain facts, upon which under the Act of Congress an order of deportation may be based.\u00a0 And while the submission of the proceedings in this manner to the judicial power has all the essential \"elements of a civil case\u2014a complainant, a defendant, and a judge<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\u2014<\/span><i>actor, reus et judex<\/i>\" nevertheless it is very clear that under the statute, the hearing may be had without regard to the technical formalities prescribed in the case of the\u00a0 actions and special proceedings contemplated in the code.\u00a0 (Fong Yue Ting <i>vs<\/i>. U. S., 149 U. S., 698, 730,\u00a0 731.) Act No. 702 provides only the merest skeleton of a form of procedure, and provided an opportunity to be heard is furnished the defendant and provided a trial is had according to some form of judicial proceeding capable of developing the facts so that judgment can be rendered thereon in the court below and so that the proceedings can be reviewed by this court on appeal, it is very evident that the legislator did not intend that the trial judge should be hampered with the rules of procedure laid down in the Civil Code for the conduct of ordinary civil actions.\u00a0 (The Japanese Immigrant Case, 189 U. S., 86.)\u00a0 It follows, we think, that it could not have been and was not the intention of the legislator to require appeals in these proceedings to follow the course prescribed in ordinary civil actions, since the mode prescribed in the code for the bringing of such actions to this court on bills of exception would necessarily involve the strict or at least a substantial adherence in the course of the hearing to the procedure laid down in the code in ordinary actions.<br\/><br\/>Holding as we do that this court has appellate jurisdiction over hearings of this nature, and the method prescribed in the code whereby ordinary civil actions are brought to this court not being applicable, it would be our duty, under the authority of section 6 of the Code of Civil Procedure, to prescribe if necessary the method whereby our appellate jurisdiction may be invoked in these cases; and no simpler or more direct method could well be devised than that actually adopted in this case, that is to say, the certification by the clerks of the Courts of First Instance of the whole record to his court in any case wherein one or other of the parties announces his desire to appeal.\u00a0 But we do not deem it necessary formally to prescribe a rule for these cases, because (1)\u00a0 the method adopted in the case at bar is the uniform method heretofore adopted, both by the Government and the defendants, in all cases of this character which have come before us heretofore, so that the procedure may be practically regarded as settled in practice, and because (2) we are well satisfied that it was the intention of the legislator that these cases should come up to this court in the form adopted in the case at bar, which is the form prescribed in criminal actions, and, we may add, substantially the form whereby all judicial proceedings were required by law to be brought up on\u00a0 appeal (<i>en ambos efectos<\/i>) under the law in force prior to the enactment of the Code of Civil Procedure, At the time when Act No. 702\u00a0 was enacted, judicial proceedings in Courts of First Instance were brought here\u00a0 for review either in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure or in accordance with the provisions of General Orders, No. 58, prescribing the procedure on appeal in criminal cases.\u00a0 As we have seen, the procedure prescribed in the Code of Civil Procedure is inapplicable to the deportation proceedings authorized in Act No. 702.\u00a0 It would seem, therefore, that the legislator either wholly\u00a0 neglected to provide\u00a0 an appropriate mode of procedure on appeal in such cases or that he anticipated and expected that the form prescribed in criminal cases would be adopted.\u00a0 We are satisfied, as we have said, that the legislator did not intend to deprive this court of its appellate jurisdiction in these cases, and we think we\u00a0 may fairly conclude that he intended that the appellate procedure prescribed in criminal cases would be followed.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 procedure adopted in deportation proceedings is strikingly\u00a0 similar in general outline to the procedure in ordinary criminal cases.\u00a0 They are instituted on a sworn complaint filed by certain specified Government officials.\u00a0 This is followed by the issuance of a warrant of arrest and the arrest and detention of the defendant.\u00a0 Then follows the judicial hearing and the judgment of the court ordering the deportation of the defendant.\u00a0 True, the proceeding is essentially a civil case in its nature, and the defendant is not entitled to the constitutional safeguards thrown around one who is charged with the commission of a crime (save only that the facts must be ascertained in the course of an orderly judicial hearing, wherein he has the right to an opportunity to be heard before judgment is pronounced); but it is molded in a form\u00a0 so nearly assimilated in its skeleton outline to that prescribed in\u00a0 criminal cases that we think we may fairly hold (in the absence of any other prescribed form of procedure on appeal) that the appropriate procedure in bringing the case to this court on appeal, and the procedure contemplated by the Legislature, is the procedure prescribed in criminal cases.\u00a0 And that procedure having been adopted in practice, and no other procedure suitable to the nature of the proceedings having been prescribed, we conclude that we would not be justified in dismissing this appeal on the ground that\u00a0 it has not been properly brought before us.<br\/><br\/>In regard to the question as to whether it is the duty of the trial courts to take in writing the evidence on which their findings of fact are based in\u00a0 deportation proceedings we think there can be no doubt.\u00a0 In all other proceedings in the Courts of First Instance the evidence is required to be taken in writing, and no reason can be suggested for the adoption of a different rule in deportation proceedings.\u00a0 Indeed, it is absolutely essential that the testimony should be taken in writing, because unless it is so taken, it would be impossible for this court to review the evidence in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction.\u00a0 Under no mode of procedure authorized or adopted in practice in these Islands is it possible for this court to review the findings of fact made by the trial judge, unless the evidence is taken in writing in the court below.\u00a0 To hold that the trial judge in proceedings of this nature may go forward hearing testimony, without having such testimony reduced to writing either in longhand or in stenographic notes, would be tantamount to placing it in his power to deprive this court of the appellate jurisdiction over the proceedings in the court below, which is secured to it in Act No. 136.\u00a0 It may be proper to add, however, that of course this rule has no application in a case where, under the terms of the statute, judgment is rendered in default when the defendant admits the jurisdictional facts and offers no evidence in rebuttal of the presumption that he is a Chinese laborer.<br\/><br\/>We think that the duty of bringing up the evidence in cases of this kind clearly rests upon the Government.\u00a0 The proceedings are instituted\u00a0 and\u00a0 conducted by the Government.\u00a0 At the very outset, the defendant is arrested and he is held in detention awaiting the final action of the court.\u00a0 The hearing had in the Court of First Instance is summary in the extreme.\u00a0 These courts are all provided with official stenographers, who receive a fixed monthly salary.\u00a0 In practice, these stenographers are required to take down in shorthand the testimony of all witnesses called to testify in those courts.\u00a0 It would seem that under such circumstances, the duty of certifying the evidence together with the rest of the record up to this court, upon appeal, would normally and naturally fall upon the clerk.\u00a0 In appeals in criminal cases this is the uniform practice, and no reason suggests itself why it should not be followed in proceedings of this nature.\u00a0 Strong and indeed compelling reasons forbid the imposition upon the defendant of the burden of expense\u00a0 which he would be compelled to bear were he required to bring the evidence up on appeal.\u00a0 The imposition of such a burden would practically amount in many if not in most cases of this kind to a denial of the right of appeal.\u00a0 In the absence of express statutory requirement to the contrary, we think that sound practice and the natural course of procedure in the courts of these Islands impose the duty on the Government, through its clerks and official stenographers, to preserve in writing and to certify the testimony taken in deportation cases to this court for review in any case where an appeal is duly perfected.<br\/><br\/>What has been said practically disposes of the question of the duty and the jurisdiction of this court to review the evidence taken in the court below.\u00a0 Under the procedural system in force in these Islands, which does not contemplate or provide for jury trials, an appeal wherein the appellant could be denied the right to have the findings upon the evidence reviewed by this court would be an anomaly indeed.\u00a0 Having arrived at the conclusion that the defendant in deportation cases is entitled as of right to an appeal, it follows as of course, that if he so desires, this court will review the evidence upon which the findings of fact by the trial judge are based.<br\/><br\/>In conclusion, it may be well to point out that nothing we have said in this opinion should be understood as a denial on our part of the right of the legislator to deny, or to qualify in any way he sees fit, the right of appeal in deportation proceedings.\u00a0 Indeed, we do not question the power of the legislator, should he see fit so to do, to place the exclusive jurisdiction to determine the facts involved in deportation cases in boards specially constituted\u00a0 for that purpose (similar to those charged\u00a0 with like duties under the immigration laws where an alien is seeking.to enter the country), and thus altogether to deny jurisdiction over such cases to the ordinary courts of the country.\u00a0 (Nishimura Ekiu <i>vs<\/i>. U. S., 142 U. S., 651.)\u00a0 Our rulings in this case go no further in this regard than to hold that the legislator having seen fit to intrust the determination of the facts in deportation cases to the Courts of First Instance, the proceedings had at the judicial hearings thus provided for must be adequate and appropriate to secure to the defendants in such cases an opportunity to be heard before judgment, and to have the proceedings conducted under such conditions that the parties, if they so desire, can secure a review of those proceedings upon appeal to this court.<br\/><br\/>The order directing the deportation of the defendant and appellant\u00a0 should be and is hereby reversed, and a new trial should be and is\u00a0 hereby ordered, with the costs of this instance <i>de oficio<\/i>.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C J., Torres<\/i> and <i>Trent,.

The opinion, in my judgment, misconceives the nature and purposes of Act No. 702.\u00a0 The decision proceeds upon the theory that Act No. 702 is a deportation act and apparently bases important conclusions on that fact.\u00a0 This appears all through the opinion.\u00a0 This, in my judgment, is an error fundamental in character.\u00a0 It is not a deportation act but a <i>registration<\/i> act.\u00a0 It was passed, as stated in the title, in pursuance and wholly under the authority of section 4 of an Act of Congress approved April 29, 1902.\u00a0 Said section reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"That it shall be the duty of every Chinese laborer, other then a citizen, rightfully in, and entitled to remain in any of the insular territory of the United States (Hawaii excepted) at the time of the passage of this Act, to obtain within one year thereafter a certificate of residence in the insular territory wherein he resides, which certificate shall entitle him to residence therein, and upon failure to obtain such certificate as herein provided he shall be deported from such insular territory;\u00a0 and the Philippine Commission\u00a0 is authorized and required to make all regulations and provisions necessary for the enforcement of this section in the Philippine Islands, including the form and substance of the certificate of residence so that the same shall clearly and sufficiently identify the holder thereof and enable officials to prevent fraud in the transfer of the same: <i>Provided, however<\/i>, That if said Philippine Commission shall find that it is impossible\u00a0 to complete the resignation herein provided for within one year from the passage of this Act, said Commission is hereby authorized and empowered to extend the time for such registration for a further period not exceeding one year.\"<\/blockquote>From reading this section it is clear that it was not the intention of Congress to authorize the Philippine Commission to pass a\u00a0 deportation act.\u00a0 This the Philippine Commission fully understood when it passed Act No. 702.\u00a0 Therefore the primary purpose was not to pass a deportation act, but substantially the contrary.\u00a0 It was not to expel Chinese laborers from the insular territory of the United States but to give them an opportunity to remain there; it was not to deprive them of rights, but, rather, to secure them irrevocably in the rights which they then had, by registering them in such a way that they could easily be identified from those who subsequently entered surreptitiously or otherwise illegally; it was not to deprive\u00a0 them of the status which they then enjoyed, but to give them a certificate which would not only justify but guarantee that status.\u00a0 The deportation provided for in the Act was merely a punishment or penalty for a refusal\u00a0 to take advantage of the act.\u00a0 The issues, therefore, in a proceeding under the Act of Congress and Act No. 702 were not in essence and in substance, shall the defendant be deported, but, rather, has he the certificate required\u00a0 by said Act, or, if he has it not, can he give a legal excuse for his failure to have it.\u00a0 These are the questions which the judge decides on the hearing.\u00a0 The first and\u00a0 primary question before the judge is not, shall the defendant be deported, any more than is the primary question before a court in a murder trial, shall the defendant be hanged.\u00a0 The issue in a murder case is whether or not the accused committed the acts charged against him.\u00a0 Whether he be hanged or be sentenced for life is nothing more than the result of the determination of the issues unfavorably to the defendant\u2014is the punishment to be inflicted.\u00a0 In the same way the issues before a judge in proceedings under Act No. 702 are not, shall the Chinaman be deported?\u00a0 They are, as I have said, has he the certificate, and, if he has not, has he a proper excuse for its absence? If the court in a murder trial finds that the accused committed the acts charged, then the issues in the case\u00a0 pass to the judgment of conviction; nothing but the punishment remains.\u00a0 So when a judge of the Court of First Instance in the proceedings before us finds that the defendant has not the certificate and that he has no legal excuse for not having it, then the case is tried, the issues pass into judgment and nothing remains but the penalty.<br\/><br\/>Under the Act of Congress referred to, the Philippine Commission had no authority to pass a\u00a0 deportation act even if it had attempted to.\u00a0 Its sole duty was \"to make all regulations and provisions necessary for the enforcement of this section in the Philippine Islands, including the form and substance of the certificate of residence so that the same shall clearly and sufficiently identify the holder thereof and enable officials to prevent fraud in the transfer of the same.\"<br\/><br\/>II. The court erred in holding that an appeal lies in the case before us.<br\/><br\/>In this connection the decision of the court, in my judgment, is against the weight of American authority and, in principle, overrules one of the previous decisions of this court.\u00a0 It is admitted that the statute under consideration nowhere expressly gives the right to appeal.\u00a0 I take it to be a well-settled doctrine that a right of appeal (the word is used here in its broad sense) exists only in cases prescribed by constitution or statute, and that, if no such right is given by statute or constitution, expressly or by necessary implication, it does not exist.\u00a0 In the case of Pavon <i>vs<\/i>. Philippine Islands Telephone and Telegraph Company (9 Phil. Rep., 247) the court said at page 249, quoting Sullivan <i>vs<\/i>. Haug (82 Mich., 548, 555): <br\/><blockquote>\"The right to an appeal is and always has been statutory, and does not exist at common law.\u00a0 It is a remedy which the legislature may in its discretion\u00a0 grant or take away, and it may prescribe in what cases, and under what circumstances, and from what courts, appeals may be taken; and unless the statute expressly or by plain implication provides for an appeal from a judgment of a court of inferior jurisdiction, none can be taken.\"<\/blockquote>Mr. Justice Clark, associate justice of the supreme court of North\u00a0 Carolina, in his article an Appeal and Error, in 2 Cyc, says at page 517:<br\/><blockquote>\"Consequently, the remedy by appeal in actions at law is purely of\u00a0 constitutional or statutory origin, and exists only when given by some constitutional or statutory provision;\" citing\u00a0 decisions from Arkansas, Colorado, District of Columbia, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New York, and Wisconsin.<br\/><br\/>In the case of Bosley vs. Ackelmire (39 Ind., 536) it was held that a proceeding before a board of county commissioners to relocate a county seat is a special proceeding, for a special purpose, based upon a special statute which gives no right of\u00a0 appeal; and said proceeding, being special, cannot be governed by the general statute granting appeals; and, therefore, no appeal lies from the decision of the board of county commissioners therein.\u00a0 (See also Hanna <i>vs<\/i>. Board, 29 Ind., 170; 40 Ind., 61, 217.)\u00a0 In the case of Harvey <i>vs<\/i>. Pealer (63 Mich., 572) it was held that:\u00a0 \"The right of appeal is in all cases a statutory right.\u00a0 If not given by statute, it does not exist.\u00a0 It did not exist in any case or proceedings for dissolution of attachments until given by the act of 1881.\"<br\/><br\/>In the case of Steele <i>vs<\/i>. Shirley (17 Miss., 382) it was held that:\u00a0 \"The right of appeal to the high court of errors and appeals is regulated by law; therefore, where there is no law authorizing an appeal and prescribing its terms and mode, no right of appeal exists.\"<\/blockquote>In\u00a0 the case of Webb <i>vs<\/i>. Hanson (2 Cal., 133) the court held that:\u00a0 \"There being no statutory provision for an appeal, and the case not falling within the constitutional provision, this court had no jurisdiction over the matter.\"\u00a0 (<i>See also<\/i> Blum <i>vs<\/i>. Brownstone, 50 Cal,, 293; 65 Cal., 650; 67\u00a0 Cal., 457; 83 Cal., 620.)<br\/><br\/>In the case of General Custer Mining Company <i>vs<\/i>. Van Camp (2 Idaho, 40), it was held that:<br\/><blockquote>\"The right to appeal is statutory, and unknown to the common law;\u00a0 it cannot be extended to cases not within the statute.<br\/><br\/>\"The right of appeal given by statute from orders of the board of commissioners does not imply the right of appeal from orders of the board of equalization.\"<br\/><br\/>In\u00a0 the case\u00a0 of the City of Portland <i>vs<\/i>. Nottingham (58 Ore., 1), the court said:\u00a0 \"An appeal is not a matter of primary right.\u00a0 It is a privilege, and he who would enjoy that privilege must show some statute conferring it upon him.\u00a0 (Portland <i>vs<\/i>. Gaston, 38 Ore., 533; Sears <i>vs<\/i>. Dunbar, 50 Ore., 36; Union National Bank <i>vs<\/i>. Barth, 179 111., 83.)\"<br\/><br\/><i>See also<\/i> Blumauer-Frank Drug Co. <i>vs<\/i>.

State (87 Neb., 845), the court said, relative to appeals:\u00a0 \"We have also held: 'An appeal, in the technical sense of the term, is a remedy which exists only by force of statute and within the limits defined by statute.' (Pollock <i>vs<\/i>. School District, 54\u00a0 Neb., 171.)\u00a0 The right of appeal did not exist at common law.\u00a0 This right is purely a statutory one, and unless expressly conferred does not exist.'\u00a0 (State <i>vs<\/i>.

Kent Circuit Judge (150 Mich., 668), it was held that unless the statute expressly confers the right to appeal in condemnation proceedings the right does not exist, the court saying:<br\/><blockquote>\"The single question presented here is: Does 1 Comp. Laws, sec. 669, permit an appeal in such cases from the probate to the circuit court?\u00a0 It is said the question was answered in the affirmative in Defoe <i>vs<\/i>. Bay Circuit Judge (116\u00a0 Mich., 567).\u00a0 It is the\u00a0 general rule that unless the statute expressly gives an appeal there is no appeal, nor can a review be had by writ of error, in special or extraordinary proceedings, not according to the course of the common law.\u00a0 (Lorimer <i>vs<\/i>.

Proceedings to condemn land are special and summary in character and, while subject to judicial review and supervision for certain purposes, are not judicial proceedings.'<br\/><br\/>In the case of Randolph <i>vs<\/i>. City of Indianapolis (172 Ind., 510), the court said: \"Proceedings for the assessment of costs and damages for street improvements are special, and no appeal lies from orders made therein except where the statute expressly grants such right.\"<\/blockquote>The decision apparently seeks to escape the consequences of these decisions by asserting that there is a law giving the right to appeal.\u00a0 It claims that the proceeding to determine whether or not\u00a0 a certain Chinese laborer has a certificate, or in lieu thereof can\u00a0 present the excuse provided for in Act No. 702, is a <i>special proceeding<\/i> as defined by the Code of Civil Procedure, and for\u00a0 that reason an appeal lies by virtue of section 18 of Act No. 136 of the Philippine Commission.\u00a0 This is the Act under which the courts of these Islands were organized and their jurisdiction granted.\u00a0 Said section provides that:<br\/><blockquote>\"The Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction of all actions and special proceedings properly brought to it from Courts of First Instance and from other tribunals from whose judgment the law shall specially provide an appeal to the Supreme Court.\"<\/blockquote>The argument is that this section permitting an appeal in special proceedings and the proceeding under Act No. 702 being a special proceeding, the appeal lies.<br\/><br\/>The first error in this contention is the assumption that the proceeding under Act No. 702 is the special proceeding referred to in section 18 of Act No. 136.\u00a0 The term \"special proceeding\" was there used by the Legislature in the sense in which it was generally used and understood in the law.\u00a0 Its definition is so well known and its meaning so generally accepted that to include within it a proceeding under a highly special statute, passed under highly special authority, having for its object the determination of whether or not a Chinese laborer has a certain certificate or could give a reason for his failure to have it, does violence, in my humble opinion, to the definition itself and to judicial learning on the subject.<br\/><br\/>Aside, however, from the legal definition of the term \"special proceeding,\" the contention\u00a0 that the\u00a0 proceedings under said Act are special proceedings under the procedural law is overcome by the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure itself.\u00a0 What are known in this jurisdiction as special proceedings are found in Part II\u00a0 of Act No. 190, commonly called the Code of Civil Procedure.\u00a0 Part II embraces chapters 25 to 52 and sections 522 to 783, inclusive.\u00a0 Neither the proceeding under Act No. 702 nor anything remotely resembling it is found, described, or even mentioned as a special proceeding in those pages or elsewhere in the Code of Civil Procedure.<br\/><br\/>Moreover, the case of Domingo <i>vs<\/i>. Warden of Bilibid (1 Phil. Rep., 542), decided by a unanimous court, is, in principle, theory, and result, a complete refutation of the claim of the decision at bar that the proceeding under that Act, simply because it is a special proceeding, is appealable even though there is no express-statute authorizing it.\u00a0 In that case \"a writ of habeas corpus was granted petitioner, Juana Domingo, by the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, and upon a hearing she was discharged from the custody of the respondent who held her under a conviction and sentence of the municipal court of Manila for the district of South Pasig.\u00a0 From the decision of the Court of First Instance the Government\" appealed to this court.\u00a0 A motion was made to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the chapter of the Code of Civil Procedure dealing with the writ of habeas corpus being silent on the subject of the appeal, no appeal lay and the appellate court had no jurisdiction.\u00a0 The contention made by the moving party in the argument of that case and the ground upon which the decision turned was, admitting that habeas corpus is a special proceeding, as it unquestionably is under chapter 26 of the Code of Civil Procedure, would an appeal lie by either party, <i>said chapter 26 being silent upon the question of appeal<\/i>.\u00a0 If we admit for a moment the contention of the court in the case at bar that the proceeding under Act No. 702 is a special proceeding, then we have complete identity in principle between the case at bar and that of Domingo <i>vs<\/i>. Warden.\u00a0 The court in the last case, discussing the question whether an appeal would lie in habeas corpus when no right of appeal was expressly granted in the chapter of the Code of Civil Procedure dealing with the writ of habeas corpus, said:<br\/><blockquote>\"We will not attempt to review the judgment of the Court of First Instance in making this order, in view of the conclusion which we reach, that this court has no jurisdiction over the appeal.<br\/><br\/>\"The Code of Civil Procedure, 1901, is divided into two parts\u2014Part I relating to civil actions and Part II to special proceedings.\u00a0 The difference between the procedure in civil actions and in special proceedings relates, principally, to the powers of the judge or court.<br\/><br\/>\"Under this classification various proceedings have been denominated as special proceedings, such as the appointment of guardians, trusts and trustees, wills, and allowances thereof, the settlement of estates of deceased persons, etc., and among them proceedings in habeas corpus.<br\/><br\/>\"All civil actions are brought to this court by bill of exceptions, while special proceedings are brought here by the procedure denominated 'appeals in special proceedings.'<br\/><br\/>\"Chapter 42 of the Code of Civil Procedure regulates these appeals and specifically provides for the different classes of cases appealable.<br\/><br\/>\"Thus, section 773 provides for an appeal from an allowance or disallowance of a claim.<br\/><br\/>\"Section 778, for appeals from the settlement of account of administrators, executors, trustees, or guardians.<br\/><br\/>\"Section 781, for appeals in case of allowance or disallowance of wills.<br\/><br\/>\"Section 782, for appeals from decree of distribution, and finally,<br\/><br\/>\"Section 783 regulates appeals in other cases affecting settlement of estates.<br\/><br\/>\"We also find in section 772 an appeal allowed in cases of adoption and custody of minors.<br\/><br\/>\"It will be 'seen by an examination of these sections the right to appeal is given in every character of special proceedings except the special proceeding of habeas corpus.\u00a0 <i>It has not been deemed proper that appeals should be taken in this character of proceedings, as is evident by the failure to make provision for such appeal.<\/i><br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"The appeal in this case is therefore dismissed with costs <i>de oficio.<\/i>\"<\/blockquote>Again, admitting for the moment that a proceeding under Act. No. 702 is a special proceeding, the case of Domingo <i>vs<\/i>. Warden, from which I have quoted, is legally identical with the case at bar.\u00a0 Both involve special proceedings\u2014habeas corpus is a special proceeding specifically named so by the code, and the proceeding under Act No. 702 is a special proceeding under the admission.\u00a0 Neither the statute dealing with habeas corpus nor Act No. 702 has anything to say about an appeal.\u00a0 Yet, in spite of this similarity and parallelism, the results in the two cases are in perfect opposition.\u00a0 While the decision in the case at bar holds that under such circumstances an appeal <i>will<\/i> lie from a proceeding under Act No. 702, the other case holds that under the same circumstances an appeal will <i>not<\/i> lie in habeas corpus.<br\/><br\/>If the court in Domingo <i>vs<\/i>. Warden held, as it did unanimously, that there was no appeal in habeas corpus (admitted in\u00a0 that case as in this to be a special proceeding and specifically mentioned and described as such in the Code of Civil Procedure) and based that opinion exclusively on the silence of the code, that is, <i>on the fact that in the chapter dealing with the writ of habeas corpus an appeal was not expressly granted<\/i>, how can this court,\u00a0 without squarely reversing the doctrine laid down in Domingo <i>vs<\/i>. Warden, hold in the case at bar that an appeal will lie although the statute governing the proceeding is silent on the subject of appeal, the proceeding not even being mentioned as a special proceeding in the Code of Civil Procedure or in any other act or law?\u00a0 Domingo <i>vs<\/i>. Warden held that no appeal lay-even in a proceeding so important as habeas corpus unless the right thereto\u00a0 was <i>expressly<\/i> granted by law.\u00a0 The case at bar holds that even in an administrative proceeding an appeal <i>does lie although all statutes and codes are silent on the subject.<\/i><br\/><br\/>It seems to me that the\u00a0 reasoning in the two cases is irreconcilable, the principles laid down are in contradiction and the conclusions reached are as far apart as the poles.\u00a0 There can, therefore, be\u00a0 no question that the present case overrules the principle laid down in the case of Domingo <i>vs<\/i>.Warden and establishes a jurisprudence on that subject precisely opposite to that heretofore known in this jurisdiction.<br\/><br\/>It should be noted that section 18, Act No. 136, was in force when Domingo <i>vs<\/i>. Warden was decided and was necessarily therein construed.<br\/><br\/>Section 18 of Act No. 136, when properly interpreted, does not support the decision,\u00a0 although\u00a0 we look at it separately and apart from all other provisions of law.\u00a0 To my mind it is, on the contrary, a refutation of that contention.\u00a0 As we have seen, it provides that:<br\/><blockquote>\"The Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction of all actions and special proceedings properly brought to it from the Courts of First Instance <i>and from other tribunals from whose judgment the\u00a0 law has specially provided an appeal to the Supreme Court.\"<\/i><\/blockquote>I call particular attention to\u00a0 that portion of the section emphasized.\u00a0 This clearly contemplates that the Legislature may create a tribunal not strictly a court of justice with duties quite distinct from those generally recognized as belonging to such courts, and make special provisions for appeals in the cases which come before it.\u00a0 The section, therefore, provides for appellate\u00a0 jurisdiction from two classes of bodies:\u00a0 Courts and tribunals not courts.\u00a0 From the first the right to appeal was granted by that section.\u00a0 From the second appeals were denied <i>unless the statute creating the tribunal should expressly provide therefor.<\/i>\u00a0 Now, into which class falls the tribunal before which is heard the proceeding in the case at bar ?<br\/><br\/>The answer to this question will necessarily call attention to another fundamental error in the decision I am discussing.\u00a0 The opinion continually refers to the tribunal before which the proceeding under Act No. 702 was had as \"a Court of First Instance.\"\u00a0 This is inaccurate both under the Act and the general principles of the law.\u00a0 The proceeding under the statute shall be taken before a <i>judge<\/i> of the Court of First Instance.\u00a0 While the warrant, in the words of the statute, is issued \"by a Court of First Instance\" and is returnable before it, the statute requires\u00a0 that the defendant be heard before a <i>judge<\/i> of the Court of First Instance.\u00a0 Under all the circumstances of this case this distinction is important.\u00a0 Having in mind the nature of the hearing and the duties to be performed, it might just as well have been left to a collector of customs, to a provincial governor or to any other administrative or executive officer as a judge of a Court of First Instance.\u00a0 The proceeding, as I have already said, was simply to determine whether or not a given Chinese laborer had registered.\u00a0 The evidence relating to that fact was within the hands of the customs authorities.\u00a0 Indeed, the whole matter of registration is left by the act to the customs authorities.\u00a0 There exists no legal reason why the decision\" of that question should not have been left also to the customs authorities.\u00a0 The reason why it was not done was not legal but practical.\u00a0 At the time the act was passed the only available person before whom these proceedings could be brought was a judge of the Court of First Instance.\u00a0 There was a judge in substantially every province with officials and staff ready to carry out the provisions of the law.\u00a0 No other official was so well equipped\u2014in fact, it would have been extremely difficult to find any other official in a given province who could have been relied upon to meet the situation.<br\/><br\/>The fact that the administration of that Jaw was left to a judge does not mean that he acted under that law as a court.\u00a0 Having in view the nature of the proceeding and the purposes of the law, it is clear that he did not act as a court as that word is understood and accepted, but as an administrative officer.\u00a0 The procedure laid out and the duties to be performed are of such a character as to demonstrate conclusively that it was not intended that the judge would act as a court.\u00a0 As soon as it should be determined that the person brought before the judge was a Chinese laborer and that he did not possess the certificate required by the Act, it was provided that the judge should deport him from the Philippine Islands \"unless he shall affirmatively establish clearly to the satisfaction of such judge, by at least one credible witness other than Chinese, that, although lawfully within the Philippines at and ever since the passage of this act, he has been unable by reason of accident, sickness, or other unavoidable cause to procure the certificate within the time prescribed by law.\"\u00a0 From this it is clear that the judge had substantially nothing to do but put the defendant on his defense.\u00a0 The fact that he was a Chinese person could be determined easily, by appearance, name, dress, and by personal questions.\u00a0 Whether he had a certificate was easily determined by a search of his person.\u00a0 These two facts determined, the defendant was put to his defense.\u00a0 These proceedings have very few of the requisites of judicial proceeding in strict sense and none of its formalities.\u00a0 They are in no deep sense similar to proceedings before the Courts of First Instance of the Philippine Islands.<br\/><br\/>The determination of whether or not a Chinaman is registered as provided by law has never been regarded anywhere as a question for a court.\u00a0 It is one for the executive or the administrative authorities.\u00a0 It is so intimately connected with the laws relating to immigration that it has generally been left with administrative officers instead of with courts of justice.\u00a0 The only reason why the legislature\u00a0 left the determination of that question to a judge and not to an administrative official was, as I have said, that he was the only available person to whom it could be left.<br\/><br\/>Much appears in the prevailing opinion about \"the intention of the legislator\" relative to the right of appeal in these cases, the court saying1:\u00a0 \"There is nothing in the statute (Act No. 702) which would indicate the intention of the Legislature to deprive the court of appellate jurisdiction in proceedings of this nature,\" and \"We are satisfied *\u00a0 *\u00a0 * that the legislator did not intend to deprive this court of its appellate jurisdiction in these cases *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.\"<br\/><br\/>In the first place, this seems to me to be an inverted sort of reasoning.\u00a0 The primary question is not whether the Legislature intended to \"<i>deprive<\/i> this court of appellate jurisdiction,\" but whether the Legislature intended to <i>give<\/i> this court\u00a0 appellate jurisdiction in these cases.\u00a0 The Act being highly\u00a0 special, passed pursuant to special authority of Congress to meet\u00a0 a situation suddenly arising in territory just acquired, a situation requiring prompt action and quick and definite results, which would be greatly prejudiced if complicated with the difficulties, annoyances, and delays incident to trials and appeals at law, a situation involving a subject almost invariably left by the Legislature to administrative officials\u2014under such circumstances, should the first determination of the court be, Did the Legislature intend to <i>deprive<\/i> this court of appellate jurisdiction? or should it be, rather, Did the Legislature ever intend to <i>grant<\/i> appellate jurisdiction?<br\/><br\/>In the second place, this reference in the decision to the intention of the Legislature raises the question, What power had the Philippine Commission to <i>intend<\/i> anything in respect to the Act of Congress?\u00a0 Where is there any authority to the Commission to have any intention whatever in the premises?\u00a0 The Act of Congress, in its essentials, is not subject to any <i>intention<\/i> of the Commission.\u00a0 That Act is of itself the sole force and power relative to the registration and deportation of Chinese laborers.\u00a0 To it nothing can be added and from it nothing can be taken away.\u00a0 It cannot be said then, that the Commission had any <i>intention<\/i> with respect to the Act.\u00a0 The officials enforcing the law are acting with the power granted them by Congress, not by the\u00a0 Commission.\u00a0 While they may have been named by the Commission, their authority is from Congress.\u00a0 In the same way the rights and restrictions granted to and laid upon Chinese laborers were the work of the Congress.\u00a0 The Philippine Commission has no authority or power to grant a single additional right or lay on a single additional restriction.\u00a0 Whence, then, comes the power to grant an appeal?\u00a0 This is a privilege and a valuable right.\u00a0 Did Congress grant it?\u00a0 No.\u00a0 If it\u00a0 had intended to do so it would have said so.\u00a0 It passed the Act with full knowledge of the law that an appeal does not lie unless expressly granted by statute\u2014a rule particularly applicable to proceedings relative to immigration and deportation of Chinese.\u00a0 With this knowledge it was silent as to the right, thereby refusing to grant it.\u00a0 Could the Philippine Commission have conferred, even if it had tried, which it did not, that right by the roundabout way of leaving the question of registration to a court?<br\/><br\/>But even if it had been left to a Court of First Instance, and there is much basis in the statute for the claim that the question was left to a <i>court<\/i> and not to a <i>judge<\/i>, it does not at all follow that the court was acting as a Court of First Instance within the meaning of the law and that an appeal would follow as matter of right.\u00a0 It seems to me that it is going very far to contend that a proceeding to determine the mere question of whether a Chinese person was registered with the customs authorities should be left to a Court of First Instance with all of the entangling results necessarily following.\u00a0 Such a proceeding is of the most summary character; it is intended to be such.\u00a0 It must be remembered that its purpose is\u00a0 simply to ascertain whether a Chinese laborer has complied with the reasonable request of the government under which he is living.\u00a0 The proceeding is not to take from him his rights.\u00a0 It is to determine whether he has met the reasonable requirements\u00a0 of the government and thereby assured his own rights.\u00a0 While the registration of Chinese laborers then in the Islands was of importance to the Government to enable it to distinguish between those who were then in the Islands and those who came in thereafter, it was also of great importance to the Chinese, as it protected the rights which they then had from molestation in the future.\u00a0 It was not beneficial to the Government alone; it was beneficial to the Chinese also.\u00a0 For this reason it was considered\u00a0 by Congress that a Chinaman who did not take advantage of it within a year should be deemed to have been so negligent as to his right to remain and so unresponsive to the just demands of the Government as to have waived his right and substantially to have consented to\u00a0 deportation.\u00a0 Under such circumstances it was not considered that the Chinaman was entitled to all the remedies of a trial in court and to the appeal which might follow if the tribunal before which he was brought were actually a court.\u00a0 Accordingly the proceeding was regarded as administrative, the judge was appointed an officer for the purpose of carrying it to its conclusion, and, in pursuance of that idea, it was made most summary in character.\u00a0 Who can imagine the right to appeal existing under such circumstances?<br\/><br\/>For these reasons I am of the opinion that the proceeding under Act No. 702 is not one before a Court of First Instance in the sense used in the decision in this case.<br\/><br\/>But even if the proceeding was in a Court of First Instance and was entitled to all of the formalities of a trial, the right to an appeal does not follow.\u00a0 In addition to the reasons above given I am of the opinion that under the Act of Congress heretofore referred to the Philippine Commission had no power to grant an appeal.\u00a0 As heretofore noted, the Philippine Commission was given the power simply \"to make all <i>regulations<\/i> and <i>provisions necessary<\/i> for the enforcement of this section in the Philippine Islands,\" and to extend the time for such registration in\u00a0 case it could not be completed within the year named by Congress.\u00a0 Under this authority it is clear to my mind that the Philippine Commission could not have given the right to appeal even if it had attempted to do so in express language.\u00a0 An appeal was not a \"regulation\" or a \"provision\" and certainly was not \"<i>necessary<\/i> to the enforcement of this section.\"\u00a0 It does not, therefore, fall within the powers of the Commission.\u00a0 Its authority was simply to execute what Congress had ordered.\u00a0 The Philippine Commission was not authorized to enact a registration act nor a deportation act.\u00a0 It was authorized simply to make such provisions as would <i>carry out<\/i> a registration and\u00a0 deportation act already passed by Congress.\u00a0 It should be noted that the Chinese are registered not by virtue of Act No. 702 but by virtue of the Act of Congress.\u00a0 They are deported not by virtue of Act No. 702 but by virtue of the Act of Congress.\u00a0 That Act says:<br\/><blockquote>\"That it shall be the\u00a0 duty of every Chinese laborer\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 to obtain within one year thereafter a certificate of residence,\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 and upon failure to obtain such certificate as herein provided he shall be deported\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.\"<\/blockquote>Congress having itself enacted the meat and kernel of the law left only the merest incidents to the Philippine Commission.\u00a0 It did not authorize the Philippine Commission to grant any privilege to the defendant not specified by the Act.\u00a0 The Commission was to <i>enforce<\/i> the Act, not to add to it; it was to carry out its provisions, not to make new ones.\u00a0 Nowhere in the Act of Congress can be found authority to the Philippine Commission to grant an appeal.\u00a0 No reason exists why an appeal should be given to Chinese laborers who have refused for at least eighteen months to meet a reasonable condition laid upon them as much for their own benefit as for the Government's.<br\/><br\/>For these reasons I contend that the Philippine Commission had no power to grant an appeal in the proceeding before us.\u00a0 This reasoning works both ways\u2014it shows that it was not intended that the hearing should be a trial in court, and it proves that no right of appeal exists.<br\/><br\/>III.\u00a0 Even if an appeal is conceded to lie in proceedings of this character, the practice followed by the court is not proper.<br\/><br\/>I do not stop to consider the proposition that, although the proceeding is admittedly a civil proceeding, nevertheless an appeal therein must be taken as in criminal actions.\u00a0 This it seems to me needs no comment.\u00a0 I have to say only that, even though the appeal be held to be as in criminal actions, it can, in the very nature\u00a0 of things, be such only in part at most, and there ought to remain some of the vestiges of a civil procedure.\u00a0 I do not believe that a Chinaman who is so inattentive to the laws of his adopted country and so careless of his own rights that he deliberately violates the one and disregards the other should be given greater privileges in the courts of the land than a law-abiding citizen.\u00a0 In civil cases no citizen of the Philippine Islands can, on an appeal, require the Government, at its own expense, to furnish him a lawyer, make his record in the Court of First Instance, prepare the record on appeal, and send it to the appellate court.\u00a0 Even a citizen who declares himself a pauper and prosecutes his case as such must furnish his own lawyer and prepare his record in the Court of First Instance at his own expense.\u00a0 In the case at bar the court holds that a foreigner who has violated the laws of the Philippine Islands and who has carelessly permitted his own rights to be forfeited is entitled to more consideration in a court of justice than is any innocent citizen of that same country, whether rich or poor.<br\/><br\/>Again, I am unable to conceive why a Chinaman, guilty of a deliberate violation of the laws of his adopted country and careless of the preservation of his own rights, should be entitled\u00a0 to the application of more liberal rules on appeal than an innocent citizen.\u00a0 It is conceded law that, where a citizen of the Philippine Islands and, up to the decision in this case, any other person, takes an appeal in a civil case and fails or neglects to bring to the appellate court the evidence taken before the Court of First Instance, he will not be permitted to discuss the evidence on appeal and this court will not consider such evidence or any part thereof, but will refer simply to the decision of the trial court, and, if the facts therein stated are sufficient to support the decision, it will be affirmed, with costs against the appellant.\u00a0 No new trial will be granted the appellant in such case even though he asks for it.\u00a0 When, however, says the court in this decision, a Chinaman takes an appeal from a decision of the judge in proceedings under Act No. 702, although he may concededly have violated the laws of his adopted country and may have concededly been guilty of gross negligence in the protection of his own rights, nevertheless, if the evidence taken before the judge is not brought up on appeal, this court will not treat him as it did the innocent citizen but will not only not preclude him from presenting the evidence and decide the cause upon the facts stated in the opinion of the judge, but will go so far as to reverse the decision and give him a new trial.<br\/><br\/>The judge states in his decision that the defendant was given the hearing required by law; and that from the evidence adduced thereat he found all the facts necessary to declare that the defendant was a Chinese laborer within Act No. 702, who had not the certificate required by the Act and was unable to present the excuse for its absence prescribed therein.\u00a0 These facts are sufficient to sustain the judgment and penalty, and the judgment should be affirmed, if it be conceded that the court has jurisdiction to hear the appeal.\u00a0 Against this statement of the judge nothing whatever appears.\u00a0 The appellant offers nothing to show that he has in any way been prejudiced.\u00a0 He presents nothing but his brief to attack the record made by the judge.\u00a0 It does not appear that the judge committed any error.\u00a0 To set aside and remand under such conditions is at least unusual.<br\/><br\/>I have not overlooked the fact that the Act of Congress approved September 13, 1888, provides that:<br\/><blockquote>\"Any such Chinese person convicted before a commissioner of a United States court may, within ten days from such conviction, appeal to the judge of the district court for the district.\"<\/blockquote>This right to appeal cannot, in my judgment, be extended to any\u00a0 proceeding except\u00a0 that provided for by that Act.\u00a0 The Act was passed for the purpose of preventing, except upon certain conditions, the return to the United States of Chinese laborers who had left the United States.\u00a0 It has no application to Chinese laborers who were in the Philippine Islands at the time of the passage of the Act of Congress of April 29,1902, and who failed to obtain, within the time prescribed by that Act and by the subsequent Act of the Philippine Commission, the certificate of registration therein required.<br\/><br\/>The appeal should be dismissed and the defendant remanded for deportation under the judgment appealed from.<\/div>",

Moir, judge, after a consideration of the arguments of the respective parties, denied the same in the following language:<br\/><blockquote>\"The court does not consider the\u00a0 facts set out herein sufficient to warrant the setting aside of the judgment herein mentioned.\u00a0 It\u00a0 does seem to the court, from a study solely of the record, that the damages given are excessive, but the court does not consider that the defendant in this case has any right to ask the setting aside of a judgment which was rendered in his presence and in the presence of his attorneys.\u00a0 <i>If the defendant had redeemed the land or should redeem the land in the time allowed by law, a motion then for relief from the judgment will be considered.\" <\/i><\/blockquote>At this juncture, by reason of the ruling of Judge Moir upon the motion to dismiss, it becomes important to examine the particular facts, in order to fully understand Judge Moir's conclusions.\u00a0 The facts involved in the present case seem to be as follows:<br\/><br\/>Some time prior to the 1st day of\u00a0 December, 1909, a judgment was rendered against the defendant, Claro Verzosa, for the sum of P320.87.\u00a0 Upon said judgment an execution was issued and was levied upon the land described in the first paragraph of the complaint.\u00a0 Upon the 1st day of December, 1909, said land was sold at public auction, under said execution, and was purchased by the plaintiff.\u00a0 It appears that the plaintiff also held a mortgage upon said land, which was due on the 1st day of January, 1910.\u00a0 It will be remembered that the present action was commenced on the 25th of January, 1910.\u00a0\u00a0 The record does not clearly disclose what action the plaintiff had taken to protect his interest in the land under his mortgage; The\u00a0 present action was brought to protect the\u00a0 plaintiff's interest in the land, by virtue of his purchase of the same under said execution on the 1st of December, 1909.\u00a0 It will be remembered that the law permits the owner of land which has been sold under an execution to redeem the same within a period of twelve months.\u00a0 The question then arises, in view of that right of the owner of the land, What interest has the purchaser of the land sold\u00a0 under execution in the same\u00a0 during said\u00a0 twelve months?\u00a0 What right has he to interfere with the owner in the management and control of such land ?\u00a0 Is he entitled to the rents and profits during the twelve months?\u00a0 Can he eject the owner from the possession\u00a0 of the same?\u00a0 We believe that the weight of authority is to the effect that the purchaser of lands sold at public auction under a writ of execution only has an inchoate right in the property, subject to be defeated\u00a0 and\u00a0 terminated within a period of twelve months from the date of sale, by a redemption on the part of the owner.\u00a0 (Sections 464, 465, 468, and 469, Act No. 190.)\u00a0 We have already held, in the case of De la Rosa <i>vs<\/i>. Santos (10 Phil. Rep., 148), that the purchaser, where the land was in possession of the owner and not a tenant, was not entitled to recover the rents and profits of the land sold during the period within which the owner might redeem.\u00a0 By virtue of said section 469, where the land is in possession of a tenant, a different rule prevails.\u00a0 In the present case the property was in the possession of the owner, and the inchoate right of the purchaser was subject to be defeated at any\u00a0 moment during the period of redemption.\u00a0 The owner was entitled to remain in the possession of the land sold for the statutory term of twelve months, and she might at any time defeat the inchoate right obtained by the purchaser by proper redemption within that period. (Sections 463 and 464, Act No. 190; De la Rosa <i>vs<\/i>. Santos, <i>supra<\/i>; <i>In re<\/i> Ceballos, 12 Phil. Rep., 271.)\u00a0 There would seem, therefore, to be much reason in the conclusion of Judge Moir that he would consider the motion to set aside the judgment by default, if the defendant should redeem the land in question within the time allowed by law.\u00a0 Under the law it would seem to be difficult to fully understand the right of the plaintiff to interfere in the manner in which he has attempted to interfere with the owner of the land before the expiration of the twelve months within which the owner had a right to redeem the land.<br\/><br\/>On the 11th of September, 1910, the defendants, having redeemed the land in the manner provided for by law, renewed their motion to have the judgment by default set aside.\u00a0 This motion was duly brought on for trial on the 17th of September, 1910, and Judge Moir thereupon set aside the judgment theretofore rendered by the Honorable Vicente Nepomuceno, in which he granted a permanent injunction and allowed damages against the defendants.\u00a0 Later the defendants presented an answer and the cause was duly brought to trial on its merits.<br\/><br\/>After hearing the evidence, the Honorable Percy M. Moir, judge, on the 3d of April, 1911, rendered a judgment in which he held that the plaintiff was not entitled to the remedy prayed for in his petition, and dismissed the cause of action with costs against the defendants.\u00a0 From\u00a0 that judgment the plaintiff appealed and in this court made the following assignments of error:<br\/><blockquote>\"The Court of First Instance erred:<br\/><br\/>\"1. In setting aside the judgment rendered in this case on September 17, 1910.<br\/><br\/>\"2. In assuming jurisdiction to annul said judgment.<br\/><br\/>\"3. In not allowing the plaintiff damages, after assuming jurisdiction.\"<\/blockquote>The first and second assignments of error we think may properly be considered together.\u00a0 The appellee presents no brief.<br\/><br\/>In the first place Judge Percy M. Moir succeeded Vicente Nepomuceno as judge of the Court of First Instance of the Province of Albay and therefore had a right to do, in relation with the sentence in the present case, whatever the former judge might have done.\u00a0 It will be remembered that after Judge Nepomuceno rendered his judgment of the 20th of April, 1910, in which a permanent injunction was granted and damages allowed to the plaintiff, a motion by the diefendants was made on the 21st of April, 1910, which prevented the judgment of the 20th of April, 1910, from becoming final until said motion had been finally disposed of.\u00a0 It\u00a0 will be noted also that the order of Judge Moir of the 9th of June, 1910, did not finally dispose of said motion.\u00a0 Said order gave the defendants the right to have the question presented in their motion considered again when they redeemed the land in question.\u00a0 Inasmuch, therefore, as the judge had left the motion of the defendants of the 21st of April undecided, the sentence of the 20th of April did not become final.\u00a0 On the 11th of September,\u00a0 1910, the defendants having presented satisfactory proof that they had redeemed the land in question, again asked the court to consider their motion of the 21st of April.<br\/><br\/>On the 17th of September,\u00a0 1910, Judge\u00a0 Moir, upon\u00a0 reconsideration of the motion\u00a0 (of the 21st of April, 1910) in relation with the proof presented on the 11th of September, 1910, by the defendants, entered an order declaring it without effect and nullifying the sentence of the 20th of April, 1910.\u00a0 To this ruling the plaintiff excepted and gave notice of his intention to appeal the cause to the Supreme Court, which notice of appeal was later withdrawn.<br\/><br\/>After certain proceedings, which we deem it unnecessary here to relate, the lower court on the 24th of September, 1910, as well as by an order of the 25th of February, 1911, modified said order of the\u00a0 17th of September, 1910.\u00a0 The cause was thereafter tried upon its merits and Judge Moir rendered a sentence deciding that the plaintiff was without right in the premises against the defendants, with costs against the defendants, and final decision was rendered upon the 10th of April, 1911.<br\/><br\/>As was said above, Judge Moir had jurisdiction to make any order in the premises which the former judge might have made.\u00a0 An examination of the record shows that every order which was made\u00a0 after the sentence of the 20th of April, 1910, until final judgment was rendered on the 10th of April, 1911, was made at the special instance and request of either the plaintiff or the defendant.\u00a0 No\u00a0 objection was made to the jurisdiction of the court in the consideration of the questions presented to it.\u00a0 From a careful examination of all of\u00a0 the orders made by the lower court, the Honorable Percy M. Moir, they seem to be fully justified and we find no reason for modifying or reversing them.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the third assignment of error, it may be said: <ol> <li>That the defendants were in possession of the land at the time it was sold at public sale under execution on the 1st of December, 1909, and continued in the possession of said land.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>The plaintiff, by virtue of the purchase under the execution\u00a0 sale, acquired no right, except a mere inchoate right in the land,\u00a0 until after the expiration of the period within which the defendants had a right to redeem.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>The defendants redeemed the land in accordance with the provisions of law within the legal period.\u00a0 It must follow, therefore, that the plaintiff was not entitled to the remedy prayed for in his petition and is, therefore, not entitled to damages resulting from the use and occupation by the defendants.<\/li><\/ol>We find no reason in the record for reversing or modifying the conclusions of the lower court.\u00a0 The judgment of the lower court is, therefore, hereby affirmed with the costs of this instance.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J<\/i>., and <i>Torres, J<\/i>., concur.<br\/><i>Trent, J<\/i>., concurs in the result.<br\/><br\/><br\/><hr align=\"CENTER\" noshade=\"NOSHADE\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">CONCURRING<\/span><br\/><\/div><br\/><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">CARSON, J.,<\/span> with\u00a0 whom concurs <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">MORELAND, J.,<\/span><br\/><br\/>I concur in the result.\u00a0 I deem it proper, however, in this connection, to direct attention to section 468 of the Code of Civil\u00a0 Procedure, which provides for the issuance of injunctions to prevent the commission of waste\u00a0 on property purchased at execution sales during the statutory period of redemption.\u00a0 It needs no argument to show that while under our rulings the judgment debtor who continues in possession of real estate during the redemption period is entitled to the rents and profits and may harvest the crops growing thereon during that period (De la Rosa <i>vs.<\/i> Santos, 10 Phil. Rep., 148), nevertheless he must exercise that right with due regard to the rights of the purchaser at the sheriff's sale, and until and unless he exercises his right of redemption, he may be restrained from committing acts of waste upon the land, and from permanently injuring the property thus left in his hands.\u00a0 Of course, the order for an injunction issued in such\u00a0 cases should always provide for its dissolution in the event that the judgment debtor exercises his right of redemption; and in cases wherein judgment is rendered against the judgment debtor in possession for waste actually committed, provision should always be made to secure his right to be relieved from the effect of such judgment in the event that he exercises his right to redeem the land within the time prescribed by law.<br\/><br\/>In the case at bar the judgment debtor exercised\u00a0 his right of\u00a0 redemption in due course, and the result of the proceedings in the\u00a0 court below, as also of the disposition of the case on this appeal is to deny\u00a0 to the purchaser at the sheriff's sale any damages for\u00a0 alleged waste, and to dissolve the injunction against the commission of waste issued prior to the redemption of the land by the judgment debtor.\u00a0 I therefore concur with the majority opinion in affirming the proceedings in the court below, and file this separate opinion merely to avoid the possibility that the general language of the majority opinion might be misconstrued as a holding by this court that a purchaser of real estate at an execution sale does not acquire such a right therein as to entitle him, in a proper case, to an injunction to prevent the commission of waste by the judgment debtor who remains in possession during the redemption period.<\/div>",

MONICO ALMENCION, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>ARELLANO, C.J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">The charge.in this case is that Monico Almencion substituted Fortunato Canete's name for Lucio Canete's on the latter's personal cedula' for the year 1909, for the purpose of simulating that Fortunato Cafiete had bought his cedula for that year and was qualified to obtain one for 1910 without penalty, as he did, from the municipal treasurer of Mandaue, Cebu.\u00a0 His object was to keep P2 of the P4 Fortunato Cafiete had given him, thus paying into the treasury only P2 for the 1910 cedula by simulating that Fortunato had already bought one for 1909, which simulation the treasurer of Mandaue discovered on demanding said cedula for 1909, wherein he necessarily observed the falsification committed by the defendant. These facts are proven.<br\/><br\/>The Court of First Instance of Cebu sentenced him to imprisonment for one year, to pay a fine of P2,000, and the costs, under section 55 of Act No. 1189 of the Philippine Commission.\u00a0 On appeal here we find the judgment strictly in accordance with the law and the merits of the case.<br\/><br\/>But the excessiveness of the penalty is startling; nothing less than P2,000 fine and a year's imprisonment, which must be imposed under said Act.<br\/><br\/>On February 1 of the year 1912, Act No. 2126 was promulgated, imposing for this crime of falsification of cedula the penalty of not less than P200 nor more than P5,000 fine or imprisonment for not less than two months nor more than five years, or both, in the discretion of the court.<br\/><br\/>The crime at bar was committed on June 2, 1910, before Act No. 2126 was in force, and the question now raised is whether it can be applied, inasmuch as it is in force at the time this appeal is under consideration.<br\/><br\/>It is undoubtedly the law most favorable to the accused, and article 22 of the Penal Code provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"Penal laws shall have a retroactive effect in so .far as they favor the person guilty of a felony or misdemeanor, although at the time of the publication of such laws a final sentence has been pronounced and the convict is serving the same.\"<\/blockquote>If, then, Act No. 2126 is favorable to the defendant in this case, its penalty must be applied instead of that fixed by Act No. 1189, which unquestionably stands repealed for all the crimes it deals with after the promulgation of the later Act.<br\/><br\/>Doubt has arisen from the fact that said article 22 is a provision of the Penal Code, and it is provided in article 7 of the same code that \"offenses punishable under special laws are not subject to the provisions of this code,\" wherefore the crime at bar, being penalized by special laws, for both the later Act (No. 2126) and the earlier one (No. 1189) are such, is not subject to article 22 of the Penal Code, and therefore its provisions cannot be applied to the present case.<br\/><br\/>In the criminal case of United States <i>vs<\/i>. Parrone (24 Phil. Rep., 29) for the same offense, this question was discussed at length and decided to the effect that article 22 of the Penal Code is applicable, the principle being laid down that Act No. 2126 is retroactive and embraces the crimes committed prior to its promulgation. Said principle is herein reiterated.<br\/><br\/>Therefore the judgment appealed from is affirmed, with the modification that the defendant is sentenced to two months imprisonment and a fine of P200, with the costs of this instance.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa<\/i>, and <i>Johnson, JJ<\/i>. concur.<br\/><br\/><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">TRENT, J.,<\/span> <i>concurring<\/i>:<br\/><br\/>In my opinion, Act No. 1189, with its amendments, is not a special law, and as article 22 of the Penal Code is one of the principal articles of the same, it is perfectly applicable to the present case.\u00a0 For these reasons-1 concur with the dispositive part of the decision. <\/div>",

S. Crossfield, judge, whereby he sentenced them jointly and severally to pay to the plaintiffs the sum of P8,905.22, with interest at the rate of 6 per cent per annum from May 28, 1912, and the costs.<br\/><br\/>By a written complaint of May 28, 1912, counsel for the plaintiffs brought suit in the Court of First Instance of this city and alleged that, according to an instrument ratified on February 15 of the same year, before a notary, the plaintiffs being duly authorized, sold all the business, including the assets and liabilities, of the special partnership known as M. Kosca &amp; Co., established on Calle Lavezares, Binondo, to the defendant Manuel Kosca for the sum of P9,073.72, payable in monthly installments of P168.50 each, of which the first payment and installment was to be made on March 31, 1912; that it was further stipulated that, should the purchaser fail to pay any installment when due, the vendors would be entitled immediately to demand the total payment of balance of the price, without awaiting the maturity of the monthly installments; that Sixto Mendoza became bondsman jointly with the purchaser Kosca, to guarantee the fulfilment of the obligation, contracted by the latter in the said instrument; that the purchaser, Manuel Kosca, paid only the first installment, pertaining to March, 1912, and failed to pay the sum of P168.50, corresponding to the following month of April, nor was this second installment paid by his bondsman, in spite of the requests duly made upon him so to do; and that it was to the plaintiffs' interests to demand the immediate payment of the total unpaid balance of the price of the sale, without awaiting payment by monthly installments.\u00a0 Said counsel therefore prayed that judgment be rendered by sentencing the defendants jointly and severally to pay the sum of P8,905.22, together with the legal interest thereon, and the costs.<br\/><br\/>The demurrer filed by the defendants having been overruled, counsel for the defendant Sixto Mendoza asked that the complaint filed against him be quashed, with the costs against the plaintiffs, and alleged in his petition that, after the execution of the said instrument, that is, in April, 1912, the defendant Mendoza transferred to Jose Infante all the rights which the former had in the store that had been sold; and that the plaintiffs agreed with Mendoza and with the purchaser Infante that the latter should subrogate the former and release him from all liability to the plaintiffs, and that the plaintiffs should subrogate the defendant Mendoza in all the rights which he might have against the said Infante in the matter of the price of the sale of the said store, a sale effected with the consent and approval of the defendants, who should be styled the plaintiffs.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the other defendant, Manuel Kosca, denied each and all of the allegations contained in the complaint, with the exception of those admitted as true in the said answer, and admitted the facts set out in paragraphs 2 and 4 of the complaint.\u00a0 As a special defense he alleged that, on February 15, 1912, the defendant Kosca acquired from the plaintiffs by purchase the machine and carpenter shop of the said special partnership, and that, in April of the same year, by virtue of an agreement between Kosca and the plaintiffs, the former sold and transferred the said shop to Jose Infante, together with all his rights, actions and obligations thereto pertaining, under the approval and with the mediation of the plaintiffs; that, as a result of such sale, Infante, on the 25th of the said month of April, took charge of the shop sold to him, with all the assets and liabilities\u00a0 of the business, and assumed the obligation to pay all of Kosca's debts\u00a0 and those of the said partnership, under the terms and conditions set forth in the instrument executed for the purpose by the contracting parties, with the approval of the plaintiffs themselves; that, among other conditions, it was stipulated that the purchaser Infante should thenceforth pay to the plaintiffs\u00a0 the monthly installments of P168.50, upon their maturity, until he\u00a0 should have paid them the sum of P9,072.72; that, should there be default in the payment of any installment, the debt should thereby immediately become due and the total balance owing should be demandable forthwith; and that, as a guarantee for the payment of the monthly installments until the extinction of the debt, a special mortgage should be placed on the property referred to; that, by virtue of the stipulations made, Jose Infante bound himself to comply with each and all of the obligations specified, released Kosca from all liability toward the plaintiffs and assumed all the rights and obligations that the said special partnership had had since the day of its organization; and that the plaintiffs were\u00a0 aware of each and all of the clauses and conditions of the said contract and approved the transfer made by Kosca to Infante and, consequently, released the former from all liability, on which account the plaintiffs ought to sue Jose Infante, the present owner of the said shop, who subrogated the defendant Kosca in all the rights, actions and obligations that the latter might have.\u00a0 Said counsel therefore prayed that the defendant Manuel Kosca be absolved from the complaint, with the costs against the plaintiffs.<br\/><br\/>After a hearing of the case and the introduction of evidence by both parties, the court rendered the judgment aforementioned, to which exception was entered by the attorneys for the defendants, who also moved for a new trial; this motion was overruled, an exception was taken by the defendant-appellants, and the proper bill of exceptions having been presented, the same was approved, certified and forwarded to the clerk of this court.<br\/><br\/>The question pending between the parties is whether the contract contained in the instrument Exhibit 1, drawn up on April 26, 1912, though not ratified before a notary on account of one of the contracting parties not having fulfilled the stipulated requirement of presenting two bondsmen who should guarantee the said purchaser-party's compliance with the obligations assumed by him, is a perfect, valid and effective contract, and, if so, whether it produces the effect of relieving the vendor, Kosca, and\u00a0 his bondsman from the obligations covenanted in the previous contract of February 15, 1912, executed between these two and the plaintiffs, the original owners of the machine and carpenter shop sold to the said Manuel Kosca.<br\/><br\/>In order to decide the first point relative to whether the contract contained in the aforementioned instrument Exhibit 1 is valid and effective, an examination must be made to ascertain whether this contract became perfected between the contracting parties, since, pursuant to article 1278 of the Civil Code, contracts shall be binding, whatever may be the form in which they may have been executed, provided the essential conditions required for their validity exist.<br\/><br\/>It is a fact that the interested parties agreed to execute a contract\u00a0 for the purchase and sale, through the mediation of the plaintiffs, of a machine and carpenter shop belonging to Manuel Kosca, by virtue of which the purchaser, Jose Infante, should be subrogated in place of the vendor, Kosca, with respect to the rights and obligations contracted by the latter in accordance with the previous contract of sale executed between him and the plaintiffs on February 15, 1912; and, for this purpose, Kosca's substitute, Jose Infante, bound himself to present two bondsmen who would guarantee Infante's fulfillment, as Kosca's substitute, with respect to the obligations\u00a0 contracted by Kosca toward the plaintiffs; but, though it appears that the latter signed the\u00a0 said instrument, it constituted only a proposed agreement drawn up by the notary, until it should be ratified by the contracting parties, and it cannot be held that a proposed contract is binding, because it is not perfect and the essential conditions required for its validity do not exist.<br\/><br\/>It was signed by the contracting parties, and particularly by the plaintiffs, upon the condition that the principal obligor, Jose Infante, would comply with all the conditions therein stipulated, among which was the furnishing of security by two bondsmen; and because this requirement, stipulated in condition 5 of the said contract, was not complied with (for Infante was unable to furnish two bondsmen, as the two persons presented by him in the office of the notary would not sign the instrument, according to the latter's testimony), the plaintiffs, who intervened as creditors and\u00a0 parties principally interested in the contract of sale stipulated between the vendor Kosca and the vendee Infante, refused to ratify the said contract before a notary.<br\/><br\/>Article 1114 of the Civil Code prescribes: \"In conditional obligations, the acquisition of rights, as well as the extinction or loss of those already acquired, shall depend upon the event constituting the condition.\"<br\/><br\/>The condition imposed by the plaintiffs, creditors entitled to collect nearly the whole price of the sale of the said shop, was that the purchaser, Infante, should guarantee the fulfillment of the obligations for the execution of which he was to substitute Kosca in taking charge of the shop, and the plaintiffs' consent to the sale and transfer of the shop by Kosca to Infante was dependent on that condition.<br\/><br\/>Since the said condition was unfulfilled, to wit, that two bondsmen should guarantee the liability that would be contracted by Jose Infante, it is\u00a0 unquestionable that the plaintiffs cannot be obliged to consent to the stipulations covenanted between Kosca and Infante and that the instrument, Exhibit 1, contains only a projected contract, one not perfected because of the lack of consent on the part of the plaintiffs, which is a requisite prescribed in article 1261 of the\u00a0 Civil Code.<br\/><br\/>On this hypothesis, that the contract of purchase and sale projected in the instrument Exhibit 1 did not rest upon the express consent of the plaintiffs, it is evident that this instrument has not produced the effect of annulling or invalidating the previous contract of February 15, 1912, executed by Manuel Kosca in favor of the plaintiffs, and that, if this first contract subsists and is maintained and neither Kosca nor his bondsman, Sixto Mendoza, has been substituted by Jose Infante, nor by the latter relieved from the fulfillment of the obligations established in the said previous contract, then Manuel Kosca is still bound to comply with the obligations and liabilities he assumed toward the plaintiffs under the guarantee given jointly and severally by him and his bondsman, Sixto Mendoza.<br\/><br\/>Whatever may be the nature of the contract entered into between Kosca and Infante, the stipulations therein made can in no wise affect the rights of the plaintiffs, who consented to its execution only\u00a0 under the explicit condition of there being bondsmen, which condition Infante did not fulfill, and therefore it can not be held that the plaintiffs gave their consent to such contract.<br\/><br\/>The defendant Kosca, after paying\u00a0 the first installment or the sum of P168.50, failed to make the other partial payments agreed upon, wherefore, in accordance with the agreement, he is legally obliged to pay all the rest of the price of the sale, which amounts to P9,073.72, and is likewise liable for the legal interest thereon from May 28, 1912, on account of his default, pursuant to the provisions of article 1108 of the Civil Code.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the first error assigned by the appellant, it is to be noted that counsel for the defendant Kosca admitted the allegation\u00a0 contained in paragraph 2 of the complaint and in which it is averred that the plaintiffs had sold the said shop to Kosca, and, furthermore, inasmuch as this defendant paid the plaintiffs the first installment agreed upon and the latter all appear and demand from him payment of the rest of the price of the shop sold, it is neither reasonable nor permissible for Kosca now to impugn the personality of the plaintiffs with whom he had covenanted the purchase of the said shop and to whom he bound himself to pay them the price of the sale and to whom he paid the first installment.\u00a0 It would be neither proper nor lawful to allow him to. assail the status of the plaintiffs, who were in his opinion, when he executed with them the contract of February\u00a0 15, 1912, competent persons with the right to sell him the shop in question, but whose personality and rights he impugns when called upon to pay.<br\/><br\/>Thus the errors assigned by the appellants to the judgment appealed from are deemed to have been refuted, and the said judgment should be, as it is hereby, affirmed; with the costs against the appellants.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Saberon, 19 Phil. Rep., 391), we are of the opinion that the defendant must be acquitted in either case.<br\/><br\/>Certainly one cannot be convicted of the crime of misappropriation of public funds when such funds have actually been paid out by him in good faith to persons who have rendered services to the municipality of which he is treasurer and under and in accordance with resolutions of the municipal council authorizing him to make such payments.\u00a0 Such disposition of the moneys of the municipality lacks many essential elements going to make up the crime of misappropriation of public funds.\u00a0 There is no criminal intent.\u00a0 There is no such conversion of the money to the use of the accused or to the use of any other person as is contemplated by the criminal law.\u00a0 There is no such deprivation of the municipality of its funds as is required to make the act criminal.\u00a0 It is true that section 2 of Act No. 1740 provides that \"the absence of any of the public funds or property of which any person described in said section has charge, and any failure or inability of such person to produce all the funds and property properly in his charge on the demand of an officer authorized to examine or inspect such person, office, treasury, or depository, shall be deemed to be <i>prima facie<\/i> evidence that such missing funds or property have been put to personal uses or used for personal ends by such person within the meaning of the preceding section;\" but it must be borne in mind that along with the proof of the absence of the sum of P2,505.61 goes also the proof that the accused had paid out said money in the interest and for the benefit of the municipality, in good faith and in the honest belief that he had the right and that it was his duty to do so. If he honestly erred in the payment of said moneys, if he paid them out upon insufficient vouchers, if he did not furnish precisely the <i>kind<\/i> of proof required by law, that does not necessarily mean that he is a criminal.\u00a0 If he made an <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">honest<\/span> mistake as to the law or the facts as to his duties relative to the expenditure of the public funds, although he might be liable civilly he is not criminally.\u00a0 The mere absence of the funds establishes against him merely a <i>prima facie<\/i> case which can be overcome by the production of evidence negativing the implication of criminality springing from such absence.<br\/><br\/>In the case of the United States <i>vs<\/i>. Catolico (18 Phil. Rep., 504, 506), the court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The case made against the appellant lacks many of the essential elements required by law to be present in the crime of malversation of public funds.\u00a0 The accused did not convert the money to his own use or to the use of any other person; neither did he feloniously permit anybody else to convert it.\u00a0 Everything he did was done in good faith under the belief that he was acting judicially and correctly.\u00a0 The fact that he ordered the sums, deposited in his hands by the defendants-appellants in the sixteen actions referred to, attached for the benefit of the plaintiff in those actions, after the appeals had been dismissed and the judgments in his court had become final, and that he delivered the said sums to the plaintiff in satisfaction of the judgment which he held in those cases, cannot be considered an appropriation or a taking of said sums within the meaning of Act No. 1740.\u00a0 He believed that, as presiding officer of the court of justice of the peace, he had a perfect right under the law to cancel the bonds when it was clearly shown to him that the sureties thereon were insolvent, to require the filing of new undertakings, giving the parties ample time within which to do so, to dismiss the appeals in case said undertakings were not Hied, and to declare the judgment final.\u00a0 He believed that after said appeals had been dismissed and said judgment had become final, the sums deposited were subject to be applied in payment of the judgments in the actions in which said sums had been deposited and that he was acting judicially and legally in making such applications.<br\/><br\/>\"To constitute a crime, the act must, except in certain crimes made such by statute, be accompanied by a criminal intent, or by such negligence or indifference to duty or to consequences, as, in law, is equivalent to criminal intent.\u00a0 The maxim is, <i>actus non facit reum, nisi mens rea\u2014<\/i>a crime is not committed if the mind of the person performing the act complained of be innocent.<br\/><br\/>\"In the case at bar the appellant was engaged in exercising the functions of a court of justice of the peace.\u00a0 He had jurisdiction of the actions before him.\u00a0 He had a right and it was his duty to require the payment by each appellant of P16, as well as the giving of a proper undertaking with solvent sureties.\u00a0 While, in dismissing the appeals and delivering the P256 to the plaintiff in said cases, he may have exceeded his authority as such court and passed beyond the limits of his jurisdiction and power, a question we do not now discuss or decide, it was, so far as appears from the record, at most a pure mistake of judgment, an error of the mind operating upon a state of facts.\u00a0 Giving the act complained of the signification most detrimental to the appellant, it nevertheless, was simply the result of the erroneous exercise of the judicial function, and not an intention to deprive any person of his property feloniously.\u00a0 His act had back of it the purpose to do justice to litigants and not to embezzle property,\u00a0 He acted that honest debts might be paid to those to whom they were legally and justly due, and not to enrich himself or another by criminal misappropriation.\u00a0 It was an error committed by a court, not an act done by a criminal-minded man. It was a mistake, not a crime.<br\/><br\/>\"It is true that a presumption of criminal intention may arise from proof of the commission of a criminal act; and the general rule is that, if it is proved that the accused committed the criminal act charged, it will be presumed that the act was done with criminal intention, and that it is for the accused to rebut this presumption.\u00a0 But it must be borne in mind that the act from which such presumption springs must be a <i>criminal act<\/i>. In the case before us the act was not <i>criminal<\/i>.\u00a0 It may have been an error; it may have been wrong and illegal in the sense that it would have been declared erroneous and set aside on appeal or other proceeding in the superior court.\u00a0 It may well be that his conduct was arbitrary to a high degree, to such a degree in fact as properly to subject him to reprimand or even suspension or removal from office.\u00a0 But, from the facts of record, it was not <i>criminal<\/i>.\u00a0 As a necessary result no presumption of criminal intention arises from the act.<br\/><br\/>\"Neither can the presumption of a criminal intention arise from the act complained of, even though it be admitted that the crime, if any, is that of malversation of public funds as defined and penalized in Act No. 1740.\u00a0 It is true that that Act provides that 'In all prosecutions for violations of the preceding section, the absence of any of the public funds or property of which any person described in said section has charge, and any failure or inability of such person to produce all the funds and property properly in his charge on the demand of any officer authorized to examine or inspect such person, office, treasury, or depository shall be deemed to be <i>prima facie<\/i> evidence that such missing funds or property have been put to personal uses or used for personal ends by such person within the meaning of the preceding section.' Nevertheless, that presumption is a rebuttable one and constitutes only a <i>prima facie<\/i> case against the person accused. If he present evidence showing that, in fact; he has not put said funds or property to personal uses, then that presumption is at an end and the <i>prima facie<\/i> case destroyed.\u00a0 In the case at bar it was unnecessary for the accused to offer any such evidence, for the reason that the people's own pleading alleged and its own proofs presented, along with the criminal charge, <i>facts which showed, of themselves, that said money had not been put to personal uses or used for personal ends<\/i>.\u00a0 In other words, the prosecution demonstrated, both by the allegations in its information filed against the accused and by its proofs on the trial, that the absence of the funds in question <i>was not due to the personal use thereof by the accused<\/i>, thus affirmatively and completely negativing the presumption which, under the act quoted, arises from the absence of the funds.\u00a0 The presumption was never born.\u00a0 It never existed.\u00a0 The facts which were presented for the purpose of creating such presumption were accompanied by other facts which absolutely prevented its creation.\"<\/blockquote>This case disposes, in our judgment, of the case at bar.\u00a0 We refer, however, in closing to the case of the United States <i>vs<\/i>. Acebedo (18 Phil. Rep., 428). The court in that case said:<br\/><blockquote>\"It is unquestioned that the appellant was unable to turn over to the justice of the peace the said P29.90, together with certain other sums, making nearly P40, and that he alleged as an excuse that said sums had been collected by his secretary, Crisanto P. Urbina, to whom he had confided their collection and who, he believed, had turned them over to the proper official.\u00a0 From this the learned attorney for the people argues that the accused must necessarily be guilty of the malversation of said sum.\u00a0 We do not think that this conclusion necessarily follows.\u00a0 Under the provisions of the law a person is guilty of malversation of public funds only when he converts them to his own use or to the use of some other person, or when he handles them so negligently as to permit someone else to convert them.\u00a0 In this case it was unquestioned, from the evidence, that the accused did not convert said sums or any portion of them to his own use, nor to the use of any other person. It appears proved beyond question that said sums were converted by his secretary, Crisanto P. Urbina, to his own personal use and not to the use or benefit of the appellant in this case.\u00a0 That portion of the law which provides that the failure on the part of a person to account for public funds which have come into his hands is <i>prima facie<\/i> evidence of his guilt does not meet the situation here presented. Such presumption simply takes the place of affirmative proofs showing the actual conversion.\u00a0 It obviates the necessity of proving acts of conversion on the part of the accused, a thing almost always extremely difficult to do.\u00a0 Therefore, such presumption stands, making a <i>prima facie<\/i> case against the accused only until such time as he rebuts it by proofs showing the contrary.\u00a0 In the case at bar the appellant has presented proofs conclusively showing that such presumption is not applicable in his case, inasmuch as he did not receive the money, never had it in his physical possession, and did not convert the same.\"<\/blockquote>The judgment is reversed, the accused acquitted, and his discharge from custody forthwith ordered, unless he be detained for some other reason.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson<\/i>, and <i>Trent, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><\/div>",

I., did willfully, unlawfully, and criminally, and with intent of gain, abstract, and take away a carabao calf, worth P60, equivalent to 300 <i>pesetas<\/i>, the property of another and without the consent of the owner, Fernando Tion.\"<br\/><br\/>Fernando Tion, being duly sworn, testified substantially as follows:\u00a0 \"I am 43 years of age, married, a laborer, and a resident of Camalaniugan, Cagayan Province.\u00a0 On June 8, 1911, I was the owner of a caraballa and calf; on that day I noticed that the calf was missing and I set out to look for it.\u00a0 I found\u00a0 the calf in the possession of Jorge Malazzag, in the barrio of Bebbay, municipality of Camalaniugan.\u00a0 Meliton Talosig and Eugenio Talosig were with me when I found the calf.\u00a0 When I asked him why the calf was there he said:\u00a0 'This is our carabao.'\u00a0 I then replied:\u00a0 'Let as draw a document to the effect that I saw my carabao here,' to which he answered:\u00a0 'Never mind\u00a0 drawing a document because whenever Juan Lopez is brought here and returns P60 we paid him for the carabao we will give you the carabao.'\u00a0 I then returned to Camalaniugan and made a complaint in the justice of the\u00a0 peace court.\u00a0 When the calf was brought home it immediately began to suck the mother.\u00a0 The calf was 7 months old when it was stolen and was worth P60.\u00a0 I knew the features of the calf very well and I also identified it by the marks on its ears; I put my mark on both ears, and one of the ears had been recently branded in a different way.\u00a0 The calf in question was turned over to me by the justice of\u00a0 the peace and it died on August 20 last.\"\u00a0 (Rec, pp. 41-49).<br\/><br\/>Jose Casibang, being July sworn, testified substantially as follows:\u00a0 \"I am 25 years old, single, a Constabularly soldier, and a resident of Aparri, Cagayan Province.\u00a0 I am acquainted with Fernando Tion.\u00a0 He brought a warrant for the arrest of Juan Lopez to\u00a0 me and I took some soldiers and went to arrest Lopez.\u00a0 We went by the barrio of Bebbay and I had Jorge Malazzag get the carabao\u00a0 as we had a search warrant for it.\u00a0 I brought Juan Lopez and Jorge Malazzag to the barracks at Aparri and reported to the lieutenant of Constabulary.\u00a0 The next day I took them to the municipality of Camalaniugan and turned them over to the justice of the peace and the\u00a0 municipal president then sent for the mother of the calf found in the possession of Jorge Malazzag\" (pp. 49-51).<br\/><br\/>Meliton Talosig, being duly sworn, testified substantially as follows:\u00a0 \"I am 38 years of age, married, a laborer, and a resident of Camalaniugan, Cagayan Province.\u00a0 In the month of June last I was asked by Fernando Tion to accompany him on a search for a carabao that had been lost.\u00a0 We found the carabao in front of the house of Jorge Malazzag in the barrio of Bebbay.\u00a0 When he arrived Jorge was not at home and his wife told Fernando Tion that they had acquired the carabao from Juan Lopez.\u00a0 We returned home the same day\" (pp. 51-54).<br\/><br\/>The record shows that the fiscal waived calling Eugenio Talosig as a witness, stating that his testimony would be simply corroborative of that of Meliton Talosig (p. 54).<br\/><br\/>Juan Lopez, being duly sworn, testified in his own behalf substantially as follows:\u00a0 \"I am 46 years of age, married, a laborer, and reside in Camalaniugan, Cagayan Province.\u00a0 On May 29, 1911,1 sold a young carabao to Jorge Malazzag for P50.\u00a0 He paid me P23 and agreed to pay the balance when the carabao was registered.\u00a0 I gave Jorge Malazzag a receipt for the money given me for the carabao.\u00a0 The calf I sold to Jorge Malazzag was the offspring of my own caraballa;

I used to see him when I went out to the cockpit at Dugu; I saw a caraballa with the calf in his possession in 1910.\u00a0 I have not been out to his barrio during the\u00a0 last year\" (pp. 66-68).<br\/><br\/>Jorge Malazzag, being duly sworn, testified in his own behalf substantially as follows:\u00a0 \"I am 35 years of age, married, a laborer, and resident of Aparri, Cagayan Province.\u00a0 The carabao I purchased from Juan Lopez was taken from me by the Constabulary soldiers.\u00a0 When I purchased the carabao it was not branded.\u00a0 The left ear was cut, but the other ear was whole.\u00a0 I branded the carabao with my brand, which has the shape of an anchor, and cut the other ear\" (pp. 68-70).<br\/><br\/>Francisco Umingan, called in rebuttal, being duly sworn, testified substantially as follows:\u00a0 \"I am 41 years of age, married, and am serving as municipal treasurer of Aparri. There is an executive order and a published circular in force in the municipality of Aparri regarding the registration of large cattle.\u00a0 The circular provides that each councilman must keep a register of names of the\u00a0 owners of large cattle in\u00a0 his district.\u00a0 A record must also be kept of the purchase and sale or death of large cattle, giving all particulars regarding the sex, age, etc., of the animal.\u00a0 The councilmen carry out the provisions of the circular through the tenientes of the barrios.\u00a0 Domingo Aguao is the teniente of the barrio of Adaya\" (pp.\u00a0 70-71).<br\/><br\/>Fernando Tion, called in rebuttal, testified substantially as follows:\u00a0 \"I have lived in the same barrio with Juan Lopez, and I know that he has not owned any carabao since 1909.\u00a0 The land, property, and carabaos belonging to Juan Lopez were sold in 1909.\u00a0\u00a0 This is a matter of common knowledge in the municipality of Camalaniugan\" (pp. 71-73).<br\/><br\/>Marcos Rivera, called in rebuttal, being duly sworn, testified substantially as follows:\u00a0 \"I am 42 years of age, married, a merchant, and a resident of Aparri, Cagayan Province.\u00a0 I was councilman of Aparri during the year 1910.\u00a0 The provincial governor issued a circular regarding the registration of large cattle and I published this circular for three consecutive days in the barrio of Bebbay, where Domingo Aguao was teniente.\u00a0 As councilman I gave teniente Aguao instructions regarding this circular and his duties in connection with the making of the reports\" (pp. 73-75).<br\/><br\/>The trial court convicted the defendant Juan Lopez of theft of a carabao valued at P60 and\u00a0 sentenced him to be imprisoned in the manner prescribed by law for a period of two years eleven months and eleven days, and to pay the costs.\u00a0 The defendant Jorge Malazzag was acquitted.<br\/><br\/>The appellant claims that the lower court erred:\u00a0 (1) In finding that the carabao calf which disappeared from the premises of the complaining witness was in fact stolen; (2) in finding\u00a0 that the calf found in the possession of Jorge Malazzag was the property of the complaining witness; (3) in finding that the defendant, Juan Lopez, did not sell the calf in question to Jorge Malazzag prior to the date of the alleged theft; (4) in finding the facts as proved sufficient to sustain a conviction.<br\/><br\/>We are of opinion, however, that the evidence of record clearly establishes the theft of the carabao calf described in the complaint, and that after the date of the theft it was sold and delivered to Jorge Malazzag by the accused.<br\/><br\/>The trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses testify, accepted as true the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution, and declined to belieye the story told on the witness stand by the defendant and by his witness Toribio Letang.\u00a0 There is nothing in the record which would justify us in holding that the trial judge erred in this regard.\u00a0 The evidence submitted by the prosecution disclosing that the carabao calf described in the complaint disappeared without his knowledge or consent from the side of its mother on the 8th day of June, 1911, and that not long thereafter it was sold by the accused to Jorge Malazzag, sufficiently establishes the guilt of the accused of the theft of the carabao calf, in the absence of any satisfactory explanation by the accused as to how it came into\u00a0 his possession.\u00a0 The false statements made by the accused in this regard in no wise lessen the force of the presumption against him based on the evidence for the prosecution, and, on the contrary, tend to confirm the presumption of his guilt, which arises under the well settled doctrine of the criminal law as laid down in many cases in our reports, \"That the unexplained possession of stolen property raises a presumption that the possessor is guilty of the theft.\"<br\/><br\/>The trial court imposed the penalty prescribed by the Penal Code, but overlooked\u00a0 the provisions of Act No. 2030, enacted February 3, 1911, amending the provisions of article 520 of the Penal Code by imposing a severer penalty for the crimes of robbery and theft of large cattle, and prescribing that the penalties\u00a0 next higher in degree than those respectively prescribed in article 518 of the Penal Code shall be imposed for the crime of theft: \"4.\u00a0 If the thing stolen was any kind of large cattle.\"<br\/><br\/>The theft of which the accused was convicted in the court below was committed on or about the 8th day of June, 1911, and the higher penalty prescribed in Act No. 2030 should have been imposed.\u00a0 The value of the stolen carabao calf having been shown to be P60, the penalty which should have been prescribed was that next higher in degree than that prescribed in subsection 3 of article 518, that is to say, <i>presidio correccional<\/i> in its medium degree to <i>presidio mayor<\/i> in its minimum degree.\u00a0 The commission of the offense not having been marked by aggravating or extenuating circumstances, this penalty should have been imposed in its medium degree.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of conviction of the court below should be and is hereby affirmed, but the sentence there imposed should be modified by substituting the penalty of four years two months and one day of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">presidio correctional<\/span>, for so much thereof as imposes two years eleven months and eleven days imprisonment.\u00a0 Thus modified the sentence imposed by the trial court should be and is hereby affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

that same was produced in the United States from pig lead imported into the United States from Spain, and that no duty was paid upon said pig lead upon its importation into the United States, notwithstanding the fact that the tariff law of the United States in force at the time of its importation imposed a tax thereon; that same was put into a bonded warehouse upon its arrival in the United States, and was then subjected to what is known as the 'Dutch' or 'Stack' process.\u00a0 This consists in putting the pig lead into a building constructed for the purpose, in tiers or layers of the said lead\u00a0 pigs, spent tanbark, and boards; in the layers of spent tanbark are certain earthenware pots containing acetic and other acids; the acids in a short time corrode the metallic lead through and through, causing it to turn white in color; the white lead was then ground and mixed with linseed oil, and in this condition imported into the Philippine Islands; no duty was paid upon any of the foreign material imported into the United States, and which was used in the production of the white lead as imported into the Philippine Islands.\"<\/blockquote>The duty prescribed by the United States Tariff Law of 1909 was not applied to the pig lead in question because the importers\u00a0 took\u00a0 advantage of the provisions of section 23 (quoted <i>post<\/i>) of the said law.\u00a0 This section permits of the importation of foreign materials for the manufacture of articles in\u00a0 the United States without the payment of duty, provided the finished article is exported directly to foreign countries or to the Philippine Islands, such manufacturing process being made under strict supervision of the Secretary of the Treasury, to whom an account\u00a0 must be rendered of the disposition of all such foreign material.\u00a0 The white lead which is the subject of this controversy was manufactured under these conditions, and the pig lead entering into its composition thereby escaped the imposition of the duty\u00a0 prescribed for that article by paragraph 182 of the United States Tariff Law.\u00a0 It is now to be decided whether the manufactured article is to be admitted into the Philippine Islands free of duty under the above facts.<br\/><br\/>Section 5 of the United States Tariff Law, which was first relied\u00a0 upon by the appellant to show that the shipment in question should be admitted free of duty, reads in part as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"That in consideration of the exemption aforesaid, all articles, the growth,\u00a0 product, or manufacture of the United States, upon which no drawback of customs duties has been allowed therein, shall be admitted to the Philippine Islands from the United States free of duty.\" <\/blockquote> The appellant now relies also upon section 12 of the Philippine\u00a0 Tariff Law of 1909, which reads in part as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"That all articles, except rice, the growth, product, or manufacture of the United States and its possessions to which the\u00a0 customs tariff in force in the United States is applied and upon which no drawback of custom duties has been allowed therein, going into the Philippine Islands shall hereafter be admitted therein free of customs duty when the same are shipped directly from the country of origin to the country of destination.\"<\/blockquote>It is now claimed by the appellant that both these provisions of law are consistent and harmonious, and by the appellee that they are inconsistent and that section 12 must prevail because the Philippine Tariff Law of which it is a part was passed subsequent to the United States Tariff Law.<br\/><br\/>It is a well-recognized rule of construction that a statute repeals prior enactments in so far as the same are inconsistent and irreconcilable with it.\u00a0 That is, if by no construction can the provisions of both stand together, the later Act must prevail as expressing the latest will of the Legislature.\u00a0 Both Acts were approved on August 5, 1909, the United States Tariff Law at 5.05 p.m., to take effect the following day; and the Philippine Tariff\u00a0 Law\u00a0 at 5.08 p. m,, to take effect after sixty days.\u00a0 The Philippine tariff was therefore subsequent both as to the time of passage and the time of taking effect.\u00a0 This Act further contains\u00a0 a repealing clause (sec. 27) reading in part as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"That all existing decrees, laws, regulations, orders, or parts thereof, inconsistent with the provisions of this Act, are hereby repealed\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *.\"<\/blockquote>If there be as a matter of fact any repugnancy between the provisions of section 5 of the one and of section 12 of the other,\u00a0 the latter must unquestionably prevail.\u00a0 If, as is contended by the appellant, the two sections are not only harmonious and consistent, but section 12 (so far as the issues\u00a0 of this case are concerned) is practically a reenactment of section 5, the authority for our decision must nevertheless be found in section 12, as this case has arisen since the latter took effect.\u00a0 Upon either argument section 12 is the current law on the subject.<br\/><br\/>It is urged by the applicant that the clause \"to which the customs tariff in force in the United States is applied\" (this clause will hereafter be referred to as the \"to which\" clause) in section 12\u00a0 qualifies the word \"possessions\" and restricts the meaning of that word to those possessions of the United States where the United States Tariff Law is operative.\u00a0 On the other hand, it is contended by the appellee that the clause \"to which the customs tariff in force in the United States is applied and upon which no drawback of customs duties has been\u00a0 allowed therein\" limits the word \"articles.\"\u00a0 It will be noted that this construction includes the \"to\u00a0 which\" clause relied upon by the appellant.\u00a0 In other words, the question is as to whether the \"to which\" clause limits the word \"possessions\" or the word \"articles.\"<br\/><br\/>On first impression, the grammatical construction appears to require that the \" to which\" clause must modify \"articles,\" since\u00a0 it is apparently joined to the \"upon which\" clause by the conjunction \"and,\" and it is conceded that the latter clause must necessarily modify \"articles.\"\u00a0 But after a careful examination of\u00a0 the\u00a0 meaning\u00a0 the section would have upon this construction we are convinced that it cannot possibly be correct.\u00a0 We are led to\u00a0 this conclusion by two reasons.\u00a0 First, because the section as it would then stand would prevent the admission into the Philippine Islands free of duty of those articles of American growth, product, or manufacture of purely domestic origin.\u00a0 For it must be considered that this construction of the section imposes two conditions upon an article which would enter the Philippine Islands free of duty:\u00a0 (1) It must be an article of American growth, product, or manufacture \"to which the customs tariff in force in the United States is applied;\" and (2) \"upon which no drawback of customs duties has been allowed.\"\u00a0 The tariff in force in the United States is not applied to any article of purely domestic origin. And in the preamble of the Philippine Tariff Law it is provided that all goods entering the Philippine Islands must pay duty except as otherwise specifically provided.\u00a0 As American articles of purely domestic origin would fail to comply with the first condition, it would be unnecessary to consider whether they could comply with the second.\u00a0 It is hardly necessary to say that this result was not contemplated by Congress, and that this customs tariff has now been in force for a matter of years, during which time no attempt has ever been made to levy tribute upon articles, wholly of American growth, product, or manufacture.\u00a0 It appears that by the merest chance, the inadvertent insertion of the word \"and\" permits of a construction, perhaps grammatically correct, whereby a clause which the draftsman intended should modify some other word appears to modify \"articles,\" a possibility not contemplated when the section was prepared.\u00a0 The result such a construction would entail as shown above is the most convincing evidence that such a construction did not occur to the author of the section or to any member of the Legislature.<br\/><br\/>For the purpose of illustrating some further remarks, we quote the pertinent portion of section 12, italicizing the words which are not found in the similar clause of section 5:<br\/><br\/>\"That all articles, <i>except rice<\/i>, the growth, product, or manufacture of the United States <i>and its possessions to which the customs tariff in force in the United States is applied and<\/i> upon which no drawback of customs duties has been allowed therein *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>Clearly, by the addition of the words \"and its possessions\" it was desired to further extend the privilege of free entry into the Philippine Islands of American articles by including not only what might be called the United States proper, but something additional.\u00a0 So the words \"and its possessions\" were added to avoid any doubt that it was the intention of Congress that not only articles from the mainland should be permitted to enter the Philippine Islands free, but also articles from other territories within the jurisdiction of the United States.\u00a0 But had Congress stopped there (as they who favor the construction which we have disapproved\u00a0 would have had it do), the term would still be too indefinite to say exactly what was meant.\u00a0 \"The United States and its possessions\" is itself a comprehensive term.\u00a0 The necessity of defining exactly what was meant by this expression in a tariff act, where the greatest precision is necessary, undoubtedly appealed to the framers of this clause.\u00a0 Unrestricted, the phrase \"the United States and its possessions\" would include the Philippine Islands themselves, as well as the Islands of Guam and Tutuila, which were meant to be excluded.\u00a0 But if we allow the \"to which\" clause to modify \"possessions\" all ambiguity immediately disappears.\u00a0 We are then told that articles of American origin coming from the mainland or from any territory under the jurisdiction of the United States,\u00a0 to which the tariff in force in the United States is applied, are to be admitted free, provided only there is no drawback of customs duties.\u00a0 We have only to turn to the United States Tariff Law of 1909, which is the customs tariff in force in the United States, to ascertain what possessions of the United States are referred to in section 12.\u00a0 The preamble of that Act provides that it (the Act) shall apply to the United States and all of its possessions except the Philippine Islands and the Islands of Guam and Tutuila.\u00a0 Used in this way, the \"to which\" clause performs not only a useful but a necessary function in order to clear up the uncertainty as to what is meant by the term \"United States and its possessions.\"\u00a0 What more appropriate way could be devised in which to define exactly how much of that territory was to be included in the term for the purposes of section 12?<br\/><br\/>Again, it will be noted that the words \"is applied\" are used in the \"to which\" clause, while in the \"upon which\" clause the verb is \"has been allowed.\"\u00a0 Now, while we are ready to concede that the United States Tariff is applied to every article of American growth, product, or manufacture containing foreign material in the\u00a0 sense that the tariff was applied to the foreign material\u00a0 contained in such article upon its importation into the country, we cannot assent to the statement that the tariff is <i>applied<\/i> to the finished article which seeks entrance into the Philippine Islands; the tariff spends its force when the foreign material contained in the finished article enters the country as raw material, and has nothing further to do with it.\u00a0 Certainly, if the two clauses should be\u00a0 read together\u00a0 and modify \"articles,\" it would be a more logical arrangement and tend to greater purity of diction to have the verb in the \"to which\" clause in the past tense also.\u00a0 In point of time, the application of the tariff to the article occurs before a drawback of duties, and there is therefore more reason to place the verb of the \"to which\" clause in the past than there is for expressing the action of the \"upon which\" clause in the past.<br\/><br\/>By adopting the second construction, we remove the unseemly absurdity of the first, which would force articles of strictly American origin to pay duty upon entering the Philippine Islands.\u00a0 The most ardent advocate of the first construction would scarcely insist that such was the intention of Congress, nor could he well deny that such is the literal meaning of the section if that construction be given it.\u00a0 These considerations lead us to reject the proposition that the \"to which\" clause\u00a0 modifies \"articles\" and to hold that it modifies \"possessions\"\u00a0 If it be asked what disposition is to be made of the copulative \"and,\" we answer that it may be disregarded\u00a0 as surplusage, or it may be held that there is an ellipsis of the words \"which are\" preceding \"the growth, product, or manufacture of the United States and its possessions.\"\u00a0 In the latter case, a relative clause is provided and allows the\u00a0 conjunction \"and\" to perform the function of uniting it to the \"upon which\" clause.\u00a0 We are of the opinion that the most that can be\u00a0 said against the construction of the section which we have adopted is that a more appropriate setting might have been found for the object sought to fee attained.<br\/><br\/>The real difficulty of this case now presents itself.\u00a0 The section as we think it should be read has exactly the same meaning, with a slight enlargement of the territory from which articles, except rice, may be shipped to the Philippines for free entry, as\u00a0 section 5.\u00a0 That is, it admits articles of American growth, product, or manufacture upon which no drawback of customs duties has been allowed.\u00a0 American articles wholly of domestic origin cannot possibly labor under the disqualification of a drawback of United States customs duties, as none are ever assessed.\u00a0 American articles made wholly or in part of foreign materials\u2014which foreign materials enter the United States without the payment of duty by reason of their being on the free list-may enter the Philippines free of duty for the same\u00a0 reason.\u00a0 And American articles made wholly or in part of\u00a0 foreign materials, which\u00a0 foreign materials paid the regular duty upon entering the United States, may also enter the Philippines free, provided they can show that no drawback of the duty collected has been allowed.\u00a0 But the shipment of white lead, which is the subject of this controversy,\u00a0 although in one sense an article of American manufacture, is not comprehended within any of these three classes.\u00a0 Nevertheless, it has been argued that under the construction of the section we have adopted it must be admitted free into the Philippine Islands because it is not laboring under a drawback of United States customs duties.\u00a0 We admit the force of this argument without subscribing to it.\u00a0 This white lead belongs to that class of articles manufactured within the territorial limits of the United States under the provisions of article 23 of the United States Tariff Law.\u00a0 That article reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"SEC. 23. That all articles manufactured in whole or in part of\u00a0 imported materials, or of materials subject to internal-revenue tax, and intended for exportation without being charged with duty,\u00a0 and without having an internal revenue stamp affixed thereto, shall, under such regulations as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe, in order to be so manufactured and exported, be made and manufactured in bonded warehouses similar to those known and designated in Treasury Regulations as bonded warehouses, class six: <i>Provided<\/i>, That the manufacturer of such articles shall first give satisfactory bonds for the faithful observance of all the provisions of law and of such regulations as shall be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury:\u00a0 <i>Provided further,<\/i> That the manufacture of distilled spirits from grain, starch, molasses or sugar, including all dilutions or mixtures of them or either of them, shall not be permitted in such manufacturing warehouses.<br\/><br\/>\"Whenever goods manufactured in any bonded warehouse established under the provisions of the preceding paragraph shall be exported directly therefrom or shall be duly laden for transportation and immediate exportation under the supervision of the proper officer who shall be duly designated for that purpose, such goods shall be\u00a0 exempt from duty and from the requirements relating to revenue stamps.<br\/><br\/>\"Any materials used in the manufacture of such goods, and any packages, coverings, vessels, brands, and labels used in putting up the same may, under the regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury, be conveyed without the payment of revenue tax or duty into any bonded manufacturing warehouse, and imported goods may, under the aforesaid regulations, be transferred without the exaction of duty from any bonded warehouse into any bonded manufacturing warehouse; but this privilege shall not be held to apply to implements, machinery, or apparatus to be used in the construction or repair of any bonded manufacturing warehouse or for\u00a0 the prosecution of the business carried on therein.<br\/><br\/>\"No articles or materials received into such bonded manufacturing warehouse shall be withdrawn or removed there-from except for direct shipment and exportation or for transportation and immediate exportation in bond to foreign countries or to the Philippine Islands under the supervision of the officer duly designated therefor by the collector of the port, who shall certify to such shipment and exportation, or ladening for transportation, as the case may be, describing the articles by their mark or otherwise, the quantity, the date of exportation, and the name of the vessel:\u00a0 <i>Provided<\/i>, That the waste material or by-products incident to the processes of manufacture in said bonded warehouses may be withdrawn for domestic consumption on the payment of duty equal to the duty which would be assessed and collected, by law, if such waste or by-products were imported from a foreign country.\u00a0 All labor performed and services rendered under these provisions shall be under the supervision of a duly designated officer of the customs and at the expense of the manufacturer.<br\/><br\/>\"A careful account shall be kept by the collector of all merchandise delivered by him to any bonded manufacturing warehouse,\u00a0 and a sworn monthly return, verified by the customs officers in charge, shall be made by the manufacturers containing a detailed statement of all imported merchandise used by him in the\u00a0 manufacture of exported articles.<br\/><br\/>\"Before commencing business the proprietor of any manufacturing warehouse shall file with the Secretary of the Treasury a list of all the articles intended to be manufactured in such warehouse, and state the formula of manufacture and the names and quantities\u00a0 of the ingredients to be used therein.<br\/><br\/>\"Articles manufactured under these provisions may be withdrawn under such regulations as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe for transportation and delivery into any bonded warehouse at an exterior port for the sole purpose of immediate export therefrom.<br\/><br\/>\"The provisions of Revised Statutes thirty-four hundred and thirty-three shall, so far as may be practicable, apply to any bonded manufacturing warehouse established under this Act and to the merchandise conveyed therein.\"<\/blockquote>It will be noted that the most stringent precautions are required to be taken to prevent the possibility of articles imported under the provisions of this section being disposed of in the home market.\u00a0 One of the obvious advantages of the section is that it allows the American manufacturer to compete with the manufacturer of any other nation in the markets of the world, without allowing him\u00a0 to injure the business of those who manufacture for domestic consumption.\u00a0 Yet, the result, if we accede to the proposition that articles so manufactured are admitted free into the Philippines under section 12, is not only to afford these bonded manufacturing warehousemen a better market in the Philippine Islands than is allowed to foreign manufacturers, but to give them a preference in that market over those American industries which manufacture the same article of materials which have paid duty.\u00a0 And this advantage over legitimate manufacturers may be greater than might at first be supposed.<br\/><br\/>That it is not possible for a manufacturer to dedicate his factory to the business of manufacturing articles in bond and at the same time produce the same article in the same plant for home consumption is made apparent from the conditions of\u00a0 section 23.\u00a0 And we would hesitate to say that there are no American manufacturers except those engaged in the bonded manufacturing business who are interested in the Philippine Islands as a market for their wares.\u00a0 It is clear that under the proposed exemption from Philippine customs duties of articles manufactured in bond, those American manufacturers who are not conducting their business under bond are placed at a distinct disadvantage in competing with their bonded brothers in the\u00a0 Philippine market.\u00a0 If the manufactured article (white lead in this case) produced under bond in the United States is to be allowed free entry into the Philippines, it is subject to no duty at all.\u00a0 The only intermediate expense between the mines in Spain and the market in the Philippines is the manufacturing process.\u00a0 This, we may assume, is equal to the cost of the same process in a factory not bonded.\u00a0 Yet the latter must pay the duty required by the American tariff on the raw material in addition to the expense entailed by the manufacturing process before he can offer the manufactured article for sale in the Philippine market.\u00a0 We ask, Why this discrimination at the expense of legitimate American industries, which should have the first opportunity in the home markets?<br\/><br\/>An examination of the reciprocal free trade arrangement between the\u00a0 United States and the Philippine Islands as provided in the United States Tariff Law may throw further light upon the object of Congress in perfecting it.\u00a0 By section 5 of its own customs tariff, the United States remits the duty upon certain articles coming from the Philippine Islands.\u00a0 In the same section, and \"in consideration\" for the exemptions provided, it is set forth that all articles of American growth, product, or manufacture upon which no drawback of customs duties has been allowed in the United States shall be admitted to the Philippines free of duty.\u00a0 These articles entering the United States free from the Philippines may and doubtless do affect, to some extent, the home producer.\u00a0 He is required to meet in equal competition\u00a0 articles over which, before the passage of that Act, he had a distinct advantage.\u00a0 But a balsam\u00a0 was afforded him for this hurt by giving him a greater market for his own goods.\u00a0 Did the bonded manufacturer object when it was proposed to allow Philippine goods to enter the United States free?\u00a0 And was the \"in consideration\" proviso tacked on to the concessions made to Philippine goods for his benefit?\u00a0 Decidedly not.\u00a0 It was immaterial to him if the United States was flooded with Philippine goods under the exempting clause.\u00a0 Such an event would not affect his business in the least.\u00a0 Yet he would claim the benefit without assuming the burden.\u00a0 But he would go still further, and claim an advantage over him who carries the burden.\u00a0 We cannot believe that it was the intention of Congress to so discriminate in his favor.<br\/><br\/>But counsel for appellant says:<br\/><blockquote>\"The appeal to the principle of protection as a guide to construction is proper, but it must not be forgotten that protection is supposed to be for the benefit of labor.\u00a0 The system of manufacture in bond is a system which is consistent with the protective principle in this,\u00a0 that it gives extra work to labor.\u00a0 Under this law raw material may be imported free and after benefiting from a liberal application of American labor, be exported again.\u00a0 In the present case the American policy\u00a0 would seem best subserved by the liberal application of American labor to imported lead which was afterwards reexported.\u00a0 If the American workman is to get the full value of his work it would also seem good policy to give for the product of his pure labor a free market in the Philippines.\u00a0 It is certainly arguable that Congress was sufficiently solicitous for the welfare of the American workman to enact this policy into law, and that they have actually done so.\u00a0 No one supposes Congress intended to foster the nonexistent \"infant industry\" of white lead manufacture in the Philippine Islands.\"<\/blockquote>While the bonded manufacturing\u00a0 business is without doubt a benefit to American workmen and does not derogate the principle of protection, this business cannot be said to render any active assistance to that principle.\u00a0 It is a neutral element, which neither strengthens nor weakens the principle appealed to.\u00a0 While it has a tendency to increase the number of manufacturing\u00a0 establishments, and thus creates a demand for additional labor, it has no effect whatever upon domestic consumption, which requires just as many factories and just as many workmen as though the bonded manufacturing business did not exist.\u00a0 In any event, its effect upon American labor must be the same as its effect upon American manufacturers.\u00a0 If\u00a0 articles\u00a0 manufactured under bond be given preference in the Philippine market, they will, as has been shown, have an advantage over legitimate home industries in that market.\u00a0 The output of such industries will consequently not be so large, and as a result less work will be afforded the workmen in such industries.\u00a0 If this be protection, it is synonymous with discrimination; but that\u00a0 discrimination protects cannot be admitted.\u00a0 It is doubtful if the bonded manufacturing business logically comes within the purview of a protective tariff.\u00a0 At least, that section 23, which gives it being, could as well be a part of the internal-revenue law of the United States as a part of its customs tariff is certain, since this section provides equally for a remission of the internal revenue tax or of the customs duty, as the case\u00a0 may be.\u00a0 It finds no place in the Philippine Tariff Law, which is as avowedly and completely protective as the United States Tariff Law.\u00a0 Yet the privilege of conducting such a business is not\u00a0 wanting in the Philippine Islands; it is granted by Act No. 1782 of the Philippine Legislature.<br\/><br\/>When we examine the restriction placed upon the free entry of American merchandise into the Philippine Islands, i. e., that there shall be no drawback of customs duties thereon, we find further indication of the view Congress took upon this question.\u00a0 A drawback of customs duty presupposes a collection of customs duty, and a customs duty can only be collected upon imports., If it was considered undesirable to allow goods which had paid the regular duty but which had later accepted a drawback to enter the Philippines under the free trade arrangement, would it be\u00a0 consistent with that ruling to allow goods which had paid no duty at all to so enter? By section 25 of the United States Tariff Law, articles manufactured in the United States containing foreign material are entitled to a drawback of all the customs duty paid upon such foreign material, less 1 percent, upon the exportation of the finished article.\u00a0 That this is the drawback which is placed under the ban by section 12 can hardly be questioned.\u00a0 Congress decided that when such articles had accepted the drawback to which they were entitled under section 26 of the United States Tariff Law; they should not be entitled to free entry into the Philippines.\u00a0 If it would be against the will of Congress to admit articles into the Philippines which had accepted a 99 per cent drawback of customs duty, is it reasonable to suppose that that body nevertheless intended to admit into the same territory the same articles which had paid no duty at all? Articles which in one sense were suffering a 100 per cent drawback of duty?\u00a0 While strictly speaking, it is perhaps incorrect to say that\u00a0 articles manufactured under bond receive a, drawback of customs duties because the tariff is, as a matter of fact, never applied, the actual result is the same as though it had been applied.\u00a0 Indeed, the definitions which we have been able to find of this word as applied to customs duties would seem to indicate that it includes those\u00a0 articles manufactured under bond.\u00a0 In United States <i>vs.<\/i> Passayant (169 U. S., 16; 42 L. ed., 646) the court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"A drawback is a device resorted to for enabling a commodity affected by taxes to be exported and sold in the foreign markets upon the same terms as if it had not been taxed at all.\"<\/blockquote>The difference, at best, is highly technical, and there is no substance to it.\u00a0 If articles of American manufacture which still have to their credit 1 per cent customs duties upon the foreign material contained therein are to be denied free entry into the\u00a0 Philippine Islands, there can be no justification for construing\u00a0 section 12 so as to allow\u00a0 articles which have paid anything less than 1 per cent that privilege.<br\/><br\/>Again, section 5 provides that the internal-revenue taxes ordinarily collected in the United States are not to be collected when the articles\u00a0 upon which they are applicable are shipped to the Philippine Islands, but that such articles shall be subject to the internal-revenue law of that country.\u00a0 As to merchandise of purely American origin, then, Congress places the manufacturer who is not bonded upon the same plane with him who is bonded.\u00a0 As to both, the obligations imposed\u00a0 by the internal-revenue law are\u00a0 discharged by the shipment of the merchandise to the Philippine\u00a0 Islands.\u00a0 Yet it is urged that as to customs duties the bonded manufacturer is exempt, while the manufacturer not under bond is\u00a0 required to pay them.<br\/><br\/>Section\u00a0 5 also provides that Philippine goods entitled to free\u00a0 entry into the\u00a0 United States shall be exempt from internal-revenue taxes in that country, but shall be subject to the internal-revenue taxes of the United States.\u00a0 By the remission of the internal-revenue taxes in the country of origin and the prohibition against articles laboring under a drawback of customs duties, both countries are thrown open to the producers of each to the extent that free trade is allowed.\u00a0 Obviously, if an article were subject to the payment of internal-revenue tax in the country of origin as well as in the country of destination, it would be handicapped in obtaining a market; and by accepting a drawback of customs duties\u00a0 it would have an advantage over the same article produced in the country of destination.\u00a0 The whole intention of Congress as reflected in the various provisions of this section was to give an article allowed free entry from the Philippines into the United States, or vice versa, an <i>equal<\/i> opportunity\u2014not an unequal opportunity either to its advantage or disadvantage\u2014with articles produced locally, so far as the general revenue laws of the country in which it was sold were concerned.<br\/><br\/>But there is another side to this question which addresses itself\u00a0 to us with peculiar earnestness.\u00a0 The Philippines were provided by Congress with a separate revenue tariff.\u00a0 The political relations of the United States and the Philippine Islands alone would have made it impossible for both countries to operate under the same tariff.\u00a0 No doubt considerations arising from the different requirements of the two countries would have also made it inconvenient if not impracticable to confer the same tariff upon both.\u00a0 This may be inferred from the difference in the free lists of the two tariffs.\u00a0 But one of the chief objects of both the United States Tariff Law and the Philippine Tariff Law was to raise revenue for the support of the respective governments.\u00a0 Inducements\u00a0 of mutual advantage were sufficient to overcome this object as to articles of home production.\u00a0 But where these inducements were wanting, for what purpose should the avowed object of either tariff\u00a0 be defeated?\u00a0 A distinct loss in revenues would occur to the Philippine Government were articles manufactured in bond to be admitted free of duty.\u00a0 How\u00a0 great this loss would be we can only conjecture.\u00a0 But theoretically, at least, it would throw the, Islands open to the producers of the whole world.\u00a0 Every article imported into the Philippines and from which revenue is obtained for the support of our Government could escape the payment of this revenue by simply being subjected to a manufacturing process under bond in the United States.\u00a0 Not only would this <i>pro tanto<\/i> deprive the Philippine Government of its revenues and make its revenue tariff a \"vain and useless thing,\" but in exact proportion to the magnitude of such a movement it would deprive the United States of a preferential market in the Philippines, which was the \"consideration\" for the exemption from duty coming into the United States of certain Philippine products.<br\/><br\/>We are urged that where an ambiguity arises in a revenue law, all doubt must be resolved in favor of the taxpayer.\u00a0 But does this mean an ambiguity of grammar merely, or does it mean an ambiguity as to what the intention of the lawmaker was?\u00a0 The clearest language may be perverted from its original meaning by metaphysical reasoning.\u00a0 As is said by Chief Justice Marshall, \"the intent of the legislature is\u00a0 the law.\"\u00a0 This is not a case of doubt as to the intention of the legislature.\u00a0 No particular effort has been made in the present case to demonstrate that it was the intention of Congress to admit such articles as this shipment of white lead into the Philppine Islands under the provisions of section 12.\u00a0 In\u00a0 fact, we find in the record the statement by a representative of the appellant company:\u00a0 \"It may be that Congress intended that articles manufactured from foreign raw materials in the United States upon which no duty was paid should pay duty in the Philippine Islands, but the law does not so state.\"<br\/><br\/>There is ample authority for excluding from the operation of general language cases which are inconsistent with the legislative purpose.\u00a0 The Act of February 26,1885, prohibited the \"importation and migration of foreigners and aliens under contract or agreement to perform labor in the United States.\"\u00a0 The Supreme Court of the United States, while admitting that the general language used would prohibit the immigration of a minister of a religious denomination under contract to exercise his calling, held, in Trinity Church <i>vs<\/i>. United States\u00a0 (143 U. S., 45,7), that this was a case not within the meaning of the Act and that the Act did not, therefore, extend to\u00a0 it.\u00a0 But the principle invoked in that decision of the United States Supreme Court is too well recognized to require discussion, and the review of authorities therein presented is comprehensive.\u00a0 In the case of Jones <i>vs<\/i>. Guaranty, etc., Co. (101 U. S.,\u00a0 622, 626; 25 L. ed., 1030, 1034)\u00a0 the principle is sententiously stated as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"A thing may be within a statute but not within its letter, or within the letter and yet not within the statute.\u00a0 The intent of the lawmaker is the law.\"<\/blockquote>In the present case, Congress was considering the vast bulk of American merchandise when it enacted section 5 of the United States Tariff Law and section 12 of the Philippine Tariff Law.\u00a0 It was not intended that such language should be so construed as to make for discrimination between American manufacturers and to provide an avenue of ingress into the Philippines of every article dutiable under the schedules of the Philippine Tariff Law without the payment of duty.\u00a0 We are of the opinion that nothing short of a <i>specific<\/i> provision in the said tariff law would justify a court in holding that articles manufactured under bond in the United States-should be admitted into the Philippines free of duty.<br\/><br\/>But it may be said that the white lead which is the subject of this controversy is not open to the objection of diminishing the revenues of the Philippine Islands because the raw material contained in the manufactured article would not have been subject to duty in the Philippines had it come direct from Spain.\u00a0 While this is true, it is still open to the objection that it would discriminate between American manufacturers.\u00a0 Nor is it any the less true that no distinction can be made between bonded manufactured articles, the raw material of which might enter the\u00a0 Philippine Islands under the free list, and\u00a0 such articles, the raw material of which is subject to duty.\u00a0 If one such article be admitted, all must be admitted.\u00a0 The pig lead contained in the manufactured article lost its identity upon being subjected to the manufacturing process in the United States, and also its right to free entry into the Philippine Islands.\u00a0 The tariff deals not with any past condition or form of an article, but its condition or\u00a0 form upon entering the country.\u00a0 As well could it be argued that any other manufactured\u00a0 article containing material which, in the raw, is on the free list, is entitled to free entry into the Philippine Islands.<br\/><br\/>Judgment affirmed, without costs.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

I., in violation of law.\"<\/blockquote>Upon the proofs adduced\u00a0 at the trial the appellants were found guilty as charged in the information.\u00a0 Aniceto de la Cruz, Benigno Madrigo\u00a0 and Felicisimo Soliven were sentenced to <i>cadena perpetua<\/i> together with the corresponding accessory penalties; Fabio Soriano was sentenced to suffer the death penalty; and all of the accused were condemned jointly and severally to indemnify the family of the deceased in the sum of P2,000, and to pay their respective shares of the costs of the proceedings.<br\/><br\/>On the night of September 12, 1912, one Otto Lemke, a machinist employed on the hacienda of a Mr. Davis, in the municipality of San Juan de Guimba, Nueva Ecija, was brutally murdered.\u00a0 Information received by the Constabulary authorities indicated that the accused were implicated in the crime, and their arrest followed.\u00a0 In the preliminary investigation held by the justice of the peace two of the accused, Felicisimo Soliven and Aniceto de la Cruz, confessed that they were members of the band that had murdered\u00a0 Lemke,\u00a0\u00a0 However, upon the trial of the case in the Court of First Instance they entered a plea of \"not guilty'' and denied that they had taken any part in the commission of the crime.<br\/><br\/>The four appellants and the three principal witnesses for the Government, Gregorio Inepto, Felix and Patricio Medrano, all lived on the same hacienda with Lemke and only a short distance from his house.\u00a0 On the day following the murder the body of Lemke was found not far from his house and it showed that the deceased had received a number of wounds on his face and shoulders and about his head; the skull was fractured and the condition of the body generally indicated that the deceased had been brutally assaulted and literally hacked to death with bolos or similar sharp cutting instruments.<br\/><br\/>The accused and the three principal witnesses for the Government were all tenants or laborers\u00a0 on the hacienda and were to some extent under the authority and control of Lemke.\u00a0 The accused, Fabio Soriano, appears to have been a sort of overseer on the hacienda.\u00a0 It was shown that a bitter feeling of resentment existed between him and Lemke.\u00a0 This feeling of resentment and dislike appears to have been shared by the other laborers on the hacienda and on various occasions threats were made against the life of Lemke.\u00a0 Fabio Soriano complained to the owner of the hacienda as to certain alleged abusive acts on the part of Lemke.\u00a0 Lemke had a shotgun with which he used to shoot chickens and dogs that came about his house, and on one occasion he discharged his gun against the house of Felicisimo Soliven.\u00a0 The ill feeling and hostility which some of the laborers on the hacienda entertained against Lemke are conclusively established, and the record shows that Fabio Soriano and Felicisimo Soliven had both given\u00a0 expression to their resentment on numerous occasions and had made open threats against Lemke's life.\u00a0 The motive for the crime is fully and conclusively established.<br\/><br\/>Patricio Medrano, 16 years of age, testified that on the afternoon of September 12th he saw the four accused on the bank of the river drinking <i>vino<\/i>; that they invited him to drink with them and to go with\u00a0 them to kill the German, but that he declined the invitation; that about midnight of the same night they came to his father's house and bound him and his father and then proceeded in the direction of Lemke's house; that the men were armed with bolos and had their faces partly covered with their handkerchiefs, but that he was able to recognize them because their disguise was not complete.<br\/><br\/>Felix Medrano, the father, corroborated the boy in regard to the coming of the accused to their house.\u00a0 He stated that shortly after the men left and went in the direction of Lemke's house he heard cries for help.<br\/><br\/>Gregorio Inepto, a witness for the Government, admitted that he was a member of the party that murdered Lemke.\u00a0 He stated that the four accused came to his house and ordered him to go with them to carry a light; that they proceeded to Lemke's house and upon arriving there three of the accused went into the house and made a demand for money and rice; that Lemke refused to give them either and said \"God damn you,\" whereupon Aniceto de la Cruz struck at him with his bolo; that Benigno Madrigo came to Aniceto's assistance, whereupon Lemke ran out of the house and tried to get away; that Lemke was pursued by Fabio Soriano and two other persons and was overtaken and killed not far from the house; that the four accused then returned to the house and made a search for money and rice, after which they left and he returned to his home.<br\/><br\/>Fabio Soriano and Felicisimo Soliven lived in the same house only a short distance from the house in which Lemke lived.\u00a0 Felicisimo Soliven testified that on the night of the murder a band of robbers entered their house, tied them up and made a search for money and rice.\u00a0 Nothing was said by this witness as to what occurred thereafter, and his story of the alleged robbery is in the highest degree unsatisfactory.\u00a0 Fabio Soriano likewise testified that robbers came to the house and bound him and Felicisimo, but he went into very much more detail as to what happened on that occasion.\u00a0 He testified that after the robbers left, his wife unbound him; that he then saw a light in Lemke's house; that he called Lemke and his wife, and not receiving a reply he and his companion (Felicisimo) went over there; that upon arriving at Lemke's house he met Berta (wife of Lemke) and Gregorio Inepto (one of the witnesses for the Government), and that Lemke's wife told him that Lemke had been murdered by the robbers.<br\/><br\/>Benigno Madrigo and Aniceto de la Cruz, the other two accused, denied that they had any participation in the crime or knew anything of it until they were arrested.<br\/><br\/>Felicisimo Soliven and Aniceto de la Cruz admitted that they confessed their guilt to the Constabulary authorities and at the preliminary investigation held before the justice of the peace, but upon the trial of the case in the Court of First Instance they maintained that their confession had been made through fear for their lives and because of the ill treatment which they received at the hands of the Constabulary authorities.\u00a0 The ill treatment alleged by the two accused is positively denied by the Constabulary officers, and the justice of the peace testified that when the two accused were brought before him he fully informed them of the serious aspect of the charge against them, and that after being fully apprised of their rights they voluntarily confessed their guilt.\u00a0 The other accused, who were arrested at the same time stated that they had not been maltreated in any way, and that no attempt had been made to -force them to make a confession.\u00a0 We think the evidence clearly establishes the fact that the confessions were made voluntarily, and were not extorted by violence or threats.<br\/><br\/>After a careful review of the whole record we are of opinion that the evidence adduced at the trial sustains the findings of the trial judge, and leaves no room for reasonable doubt of the guilt of these appellants of the crime with which they are charged.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for appellants, in a very carefully prepared brief, makes an exhaustive comparative analysis of the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution, and insists that because of certain contradictory and inconsistent statements made by them, and because of the alleged inherent improbability of the stories told by them, their testimony should not be accepted as true beyond a reasonable doubt.\u00a0 The Attorney-General in his brief undertakes to show that there are no substantial contradictions or inconsistencies in the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution, and that there is nothing inherently improbable in the various stories of the incidents to which\u00a0 they testified.<br\/><br\/>We think it must be admitted that certain discrepancies and inconsistencies are to be found in the statements of the three principal witnesses for the prosecution; but, for the most part, these conflicts in the testimony do not exceed in degree the natural variations which must be expected in the account of the incidents connected with a bloody and murderous night attack as given by different observers; and none of these discrepancies or inconsistencies amount to a substantial variance in the story of the principal incidents to which the witnesses testified.\u00a0 We do not deem it necessary to examine the evidence in detail in this connection, and it is sufficient to say that we find nothing in the record which would justify us in disturbing the findings of the trial judge as to the substantial truth of the story told by the witnesses for the prosecution.<br\/><br\/>It may be admitted also that there are some statements made by the witnesses for the prosecution which appear to justify the contention of counsel for the appellant as to the inherent improbability of some of the incidents related by them.\u00a0 One of these witnesses admitted that he\u00a0 was with the attacking party, and there is good ground for suspicion that all of them had more to do with the plot to murder Lemke than they were willing to admit.\u00a0 If they did in fact voluntarily share in the conspiracy to commit the crime, there can be no doubt that they attempted to color their statements so as to avoid making any admissions of guilty complicity in the commission of the crime.\u00a0 We are satisfied however, that, if as counsel for appellant contends, there are any apparent and inherent improbabilities in their testimony, these are limited to so much of their stories as directly tends\u00a0 to maintain their denials of any guilty complicity\u00a0 with the accused in the commission of the crime.\u00a0 Whatever their real connection with the commission of the crime, may\u00a0 have been, they well knew the circumstances surrounding its commission, and we are convinced that they related them truly so far as they tend to establish the guilt of these accused.\u00a0 The trial judge, who saw and heard them testify, could not have been unaware of the possibility that they themselves may have had a guilty participation in the commission of the crime, but he was satisfied\u00a0 as to the truth of the story told by them in so far as it implicated these defendants, and as we have said, there is nothing in the record which would justify us in disturbing his findings in this regard.\u00a0 As the Attorney-General well says, the testimony of these witnesses is corroborated by the confession of two of the accused, and in the absence of any evidence worthy of the name tending to put it in doubt it conclusively\u00a0 establishes the guilt of these\u00a0 appellants.\u00a0 The story told by the defendants Soriano and Soliven is so palpably and manifestly untrue, that it confirms rather than weakens the force of the testimony of the prosecution.\u00a0 As to the other two defendants we find no evidence in the record in support of the alibi which they undertook to set up, and nothing which in any wise raises a doubt as to their guilty participation in the commission of the crime.<br\/><br\/>In regard to the criticisms of counsel for the appellants directed to the action of the trial court in accepting and acting upon the testimony of the three principal witnesses for the prosecution, who, counsel intimates, were accomplices in the commission of the crime if there is any truth in their testimony; it is sufficient to say that we have frequently held that, \"the testimony of confederates or accomplices is competent 'and admissible, but should be received with great caution.\"\u00a0 (United States.<i>vs<\/i>. Ocampo, 5 Phil. Rep., 339; U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Butardo, 9 Phil. Rep., 246); and that \"evidence by accomplices or confederates, although subject to grave suspicion, is nevertheless admissible and competent.\u00a0 The lack of corroboration affects the credibility only.\u00a0 If such testimony satisfies the court beyond a reasonable doubt, it is sufficient.\"\u00a0 (United\u00a0 States <i>vs<\/i>. Ocampo, 4 Phil. Rep., 400; U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Granadoso, 16 Phil. Rep., 419); and that \"while the testimony of an accomplice, or of a principal, against a fellow criminal, is to be taken with caution and weighed with care, it is, nevertheless, true that such testimony may, in a proper case, be used as the basis of a conviction.\"\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Bernales, 18 Phil. Rep., 525.)<br\/><br\/>The trial judge gave Soliven, Madrigo and De la Cruz the benefit of the extenuating circumstance defined in article 11 of the Penal Code as amended by Act No. 2142, and imposed upon them the penalty of life imprisonment.\u00a0 The death penalty was imposed on Fabio Soriano.\u00a0 In view of all the circumstances of the case we think that the same leniency should have been shown to Soriano as was shown his codefendants, and that giving him the benefits of article 11 of the Code as amended, the penalty imposed upon him should have been fixed at life imprisonment instead of death.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the trial court convicting and sentencing these appellants should therefore be modified by substituting the\u00a0 penalty of <i>cadena perpetua<\/i> together with the subsidiary penalties prescribed\u00a0 by law for that of death imposed on Fabio Soriano, and thus modified the judgment appealed from should be and is hereby affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellants.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

There was a prayer for an injunction and damages. The defendants demurred, but the demurrer was overruled and a temporary injunction granted. Thereupon Forbes, Harding, and Trowbridge sued for writs of prohibition against the judge and the respective plaintiffs, alleging that the expulsion was carried out in the public interest and at the request of the proper representative of the Chinese Government in the Philippines, and was immediately reported to the Secretary of War. The complaints were demurred to, but the Supreme Court overruled the demurrers, granted the prohibition, and ordered the actions dismissed. The judge, having declined to join in the application for writs of error, was made a respondent, and the cases are here on the ground that the plaintiffs have been deprived of liberty without due process of law. (Act of Congress, July 1, 1902, chap. 1369, sec. 5; 32 Stat. at L., 691, 692.)\u00a0 <p><\/p><p>The purpose of the first suits, of course, was to make the Governor-General personally answerable in damages for acts done by him by color of his office and in pursuance of what he deemed to be his duty, as well as to prevent his exercising similar power in the future. This sufficiently appears by the declarations, which suggest and do not exclude official action, and is alleged in the complaints for prohibition. On April 19, 1910, in less than three weeks after the original suits were brought, the Philippine Legislature passed an act which, reciting that Governor-General had authorized the deportation \"in the exercise of authority vested in him by law,\" enacted that his action was \"approved and ratified and confirmed, and in all respects declared legal, and not subject to question or review.\" So that, if ratification by that body can dispose of the matter, no court has authority to entertain the suits.The first doubt that naturally would occur is whether, if a right of action had vested previously, it could be taken away by such a statute. But it generally is recognized that in cases like the present, where the act originally purports to be done in the name and by the authority of the state, a defect in that authority may be cured by the subsequent adoption of the act. The person who has assumed to represent the will and person of the superior power is given the benefit of the representation if it turns out that his assumption was correct. (O'Reilly de Camara <em>vs.<\/em> Brooke, 209 U. S., 45, 52; 52 L. ed., 676, 678; 28 Sup. Ct. Rep., 439; United States <em>vs.<\/em> Heinszen, 206 U. S., 370, 382; 51 L. ed., 1098, 1102; 27 Sup. Ct.

E., 916.)<\/p><p>Therefore the deportation is to be considered as having been ordered by the Governor-General in pursuance of a statute of the Philippine Legislature directing it, under, their combined powers, and it is unnecessary to consider whether he had authority, by virtue of his office alone, as declared by the statute, or whether, if he had not, he had immunity from suit for such an official act done, in good faith. The former matter now is regulated by a later statute providing for a hearing, etc. No. 2113, February 1, 1912. On the question thus narrowed the preliminaries are plain. It is admitted that sovereign states have inherent power to deport aliens, and seemingly that Congress is not deprived of this power by the Constitution of the United States. (Fong Yue Ting <em>vs.<\/em> United States, 149 U. S., 698, 707, 728; 37 L. ed., 905, 911, 918; 13 Sup. Ct. Rep., 1016; Wong Wing <em>vs.<\/em> United States, 163 U.

Furthermore, the very ground of the power in the necessities of public welfare shows that it may have to be exercised in a summary way through executive officers. (Fong Yue Ting <em>vs.<\/em> United States, <em>supra<\/em>; United States <em>vs.<\/em> Ju Toy, 198 U. S., 253, 263; 49 L. ed., 1040, 1044; 25 Sup. Ct. Rep., 644; Moyer <em>vs.<\/em> Peabody, 212 U. S., 78, 84, 85; 53 L. ed., 410; 29 Sup. Ct. Rep., 235.) So that the question is narrowed further to the inquiry whether the Philippine Government cannot do what unquestionably Congress might.<\/p><p>As Congress is not prevented by the Constitution, the Philippine Government cannot be prevented by the Philippine Bill of Rights alone. (Act of July 1, 1902, chap. 1369, sec. 5, 32 Stat. at L., 691, 692.) Deporting the plaintiffs was not depriving them of liberty without due process of law, unless on other grounds the local government was acting beyond its powers. But the local government has all civil and judicial power necessary to govern the Islands. (Act of March 2, 1901, chap. 803, 31 Stat. at L., 895, 910; Act of July 1, 1902, chap. 1369, sec. 1, 32 Stat. at L., 691.) The forms are different, but as in Hawaii, the proximate source of private rights is local, whether they spring by inheritance from Spain or are created by Philippine leg&amp;islation. (See Kawananakoa <em>vs.<\/em> Polyblank, 205 U. S., 349, 354; 51 L. ed., 834, 836; 27 Sup. Ct. Rep., 526; Perez <em>vs.<\/em> Fernandez, 202 U. S., 80, 91, 92, 50 L. ed., 942, 945, 946; 26 Sup. Ct. Rep., 561.) It would be strange if a government so remote should be held bound to wait for the action of Congress in a matter that might touch its life unless dealt with at once and on the spot. On the contrary, we are of opinion that it had the power as an incident of the self-determination, however limited, given to it by the United States.<\/p><p>By section 86 of the Act of July 1, 1902, all laws passed by the Philippine Government are to be reported to Congress, which reserves power to annul them. It is worthy of mention that the law under consideration was reported to Congress and has not been annulled. The extension of the Chinese exclusion and immigration laws to the Philippine Islands has no bearing on the matter. The right to remain, for instance, under the Act of April 29, 1902, chap. 641, sec. 4, 32 Stat. at L., 176; U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp., 1911, p. 524, does not prevail over a removal as an act of state.<\/p><p>It is held in England t.hat an act of state is a matter not cognizable in any municipal court. (Musgrave <em>vs.<\/em> Pulido, L. R. 5 App. Cas., 103, 108; 49 L. J. P. C, N. S., 20; 41 L. T., N. S., 629, 28 Week. Rep., 373.) And that was the purport of the Philippine Act declaring the deportation not subject to question or review. As the Bill of Rights did not stand in the way, and the implied powers of the government sanctioned by Congress permitted it, there is no reason why the statute should not have full effect. It protected the subordinates as well as the Governor-General, and took jurisdiction from the court that attempted to try the case.<\/p><p>Whether prohibition is technically the proper remedy, historically speaking, we need not inquire. On such a matter we should not interfere with local practice except for good cause shown. In substance the decision of the Supreme Court was right.<\/p><p><em>Judgment affirmed<\/em>.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/><br\/><\/p><hr align=\"LEFT\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/>\u00a0 <sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> 228 U.S., 549; 57 L. ed., 960.<\/div>",

from a parcel of land located by them under the mining laws as a placer\u00a0 mineral claim which, according to their amended declaration of location, is \"chiefly\u00a0 valuable for gravel, rock, building and\u00a0 construction material.\"\u00a0 The court below continued the appellees in the possession of all the land covered by the amended declaration of location with the exception of the banks and bed of the Moriones River, which was held to be a navigable stream and not, therefore, susceptible to location as a mineral claim.<br\/><br\/>The dispositive part of the trial court's judgment reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"(1) On the finding of fact made herein the court concludes that, being a navigable stream, neither the bed, banks, nor water of the Moriones River is susceptible of alienation by location or patent as mining claims, and that in consequence the location of defendants is void as to that part of the location covering the bed and banks of said river, as to which part of the land embraced within the claims in question defendants are mere trespassers and should and must be ejected.<br\/><br\/>\" (2) That being unoccupied, nonagricultural, nontimber, unreserved public land, that part of the land embraced in said location outside of the banks and bed of said Moriones River was and is susceptible of alienation by location and patent as mining claims, and as to that part of said claims the defendants are in proper\u00a0 and legal possession and entitled to be continued therein.<br\/><br\/>\"(3) That gravel being embraced within the term 'building stone' used in the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902, the gravel beds contained within the claims in question outside of the bed and immediate banks of the Moriones River were and are susceptible of alienation by location and patent as placer mining claims.<br\/><br\/>\"The court adjudges and decrees that the plaintiff is entitled to\u00a0 the exclusive possession and control of that part of the located land included within the banks and bed of the Moriones River, and\u00a0 orders the defendants to restore to plaintiff said possession and control, and further condemns the defendants to pay the costs of these proceedings.\"<\/blockquote>This judgment\u00a0 Was further\u00a0 amplified as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"It having been brought to the attention of the court by counsel for defendants that the judgment dictated herein on October 13, 1911, does not define with sufficient certainty the banks and\u00a0 bed\u00a0 of the Moriones River, said judgment is hereby amended and made more certain and definite by decreeing that the part of the located claims from which defendants are ejected is that part formed by the bed or channel and the natural banks of the Moriones River, which banks are indicated by the heavy white lines following the meanderings of said river on the plat Exhibit A, together with the public easement along\" said banks reserved by the Law of Waters.\"<\/blockquote>From this judgment the plaintiff alone appealed, while the appellees ask that the judgment of the trial court be affirmed.<br\/><br\/>This court handed down a decision at the close of the last term reversing the judgment of the lower court so far as it aimed to continue the appellees in possession of that part of the land not included within the bed and banks of the Moriones River, and directed that the Government be restored to the possession of the entire tract.\u00a0 In accordance with the statement contained in that decision, the court now proceeds to set forth its reasons for the position taken.<br\/><br\/>In view of the fact that the trial court held that the Moriones River is a navigable stream and that its bed and banks are not\u00a0 susceptible of location under the general mining laws, and there having been no appeal with reference to this part of the judgment, it is therefore not before us for consideration.<br\/><br\/>The description of the land sought to be\u00a0 located in the amended declaration of location is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"That corner No. 1 of said claim is established by tree in place on the southeasterly bank of the Moriones River.\u00a0 Notice of location posted thereon and is marked 'Corner No. 1, Multa placer mining claim.'\u00a0 That corner No. 2 is approximately 1,200 meters in a southeasterly direction from corner No. 1, and is established by tree in place on which is inscribed 'Corner No. 2, Multa placer mining claim.'\u00a0 That corner No. 3 is approximately 650\u00a0 meters in a southwesterly direction from corner No. 2, and is established by a tree in place on which is inscribed 'Corner No. 3, Multa placer mining claim.'\u00a0 That corner No. 4 is approximately 300 meters in a northwesterly direction from corner No. 3, and is established by a tree in place on which is inscribed 'Corner No. 4, Multa placer mining\u00a0 claim.'\u00a0 That corner No. 5 is approximately 350 meters in a northeasterly direction from Corner No. 4, and is established by a post on which is inscribed 'Corner No. 5, Multa placer mining claim.'\u00a0 That post No. 6 is approximately 900 meters in a northwesterly direction from post No. 5, and is established by a tree in place on which is inscribed 'Corner No. 6, Multa placer mining claim.' \"<\/blockquote>The Government submitted Exhibit A, which is a plan of the land made by the Bureau of Lands.\u00a0 With reference to the admission of this exhibit, the following appears of record:<br\/><blockquote>\"Counsel for the defendants admits the accuracy of the plan marked Exhibit A submitted by the plaintiff, with the exception that he does not admit that the line which runs from A to B and which is designated 'High water' is an accurate portrayal of the high-water mark in that vicinity.\u00a0 It is admitted that the plan is correct as to the contour of the river and the location of the claim.\"<\/blockquote>We may accept for the purposes of this case the statement of the trial court in its amended judgment with reference to the banks of the Moriones River.<br\/><br\/>From\u00a0 the fact that the declaration of location filed by the appellees is\u00a0 null and of no effect as to the banks and bed of the Moriones River, the remainder of the land which the appellees seek to locate is divided into five distinct, noncontiguous parcels, separated from each other by the river.\u00a0 This raises the question whether the declaration of location is valid as to these disconnected parcels.\u00a0 In other words, can a declaration of location embrace two or more noncontiguous parcels of land?\u00a0 It\u00a0 was decided by the Land Department of the United States in Tomera Placer Claim (33 L. D., 560) that a location embracing three several tracts of land, each being square in shape and connected by diagonal corners only, was of no value.\u00a0 It was said in disposing of the question that:<br\/><blockquote>\"There is no provision of the mining laws authorizing the locator, by virtue of a discovery of mineral within the limits of one parcel of ground, to embrace in his location another and entirely different parcel, lying wholly without such limits, and having separate and distinct boundaries, merely because the two parcels corner with each other.\u00a0 Tracts so situated are in fact and in the administration of the mining laws must be considered and treated as constituting separate and distinct parcels of ground.\"<\/blockquote>In support of this holding, Kresin <i>vs<\/i>. Mau (15 Minn., 116) and Linn County Bank <i>vs<\/i>. Hopkins (47 Kan., 580; 28 Pac, 606) were cited.\u00a0 While these cases involve an interpretation of homestead laws instead of a mining law, the requirements of both in this particular are\u00a0 analogous.\u00a0 This question has frequently arisen in connection with the exemption of homesteads of judgment debtors, and while the decisions in many jurisdictions are in conflict with the two cases cited, this is due to a difference in the phraseology of the laws construed.\u00a0 In the case at bar the different parcels do not even have\u00a0 the distinction of cornering each other, as the banks and bed of the Moriones River intervene between each parcel.<br\/><br\/>Again, section 23 provides that a mineral claim shall be marked by two posts, one of which shall be called the initial post, and distances given from these posts in such a manner that by no possibility could more than a single parcel of land be inclosed by the lines thus made.\u00a0 It would be impossible to comply with\u00a0 this regulation in the case of two or more noncontiguous parcels.\u00a0 Section 24 provides that a discovery post shall also be placed upon the claim showing where minerals had been found on it.\u00a0 Obviously, a discovery post upon one parcel of land would have no bearing upon another parcel.\u00a0 This would be especially true were the parcels located at some distance from each other, for once admitting that\u00a0 noncontiguous parcels could be so located, it would be difficult to refuse a patent because the distance between them was too great.\u00a0 Sections 25 and 26, also relating to the marking of the boundaries of the claim, preclude the idea of locating two noncontiguous parcels of land under one patent.\u00a0 The directions for marking out the claim, taken as a whole, clearly require that all the boundary lines of a claim be located.\u00a0 Section 37 stipulates the manner in which a patent may be obtained, and refers to the location as a <i>piece of land<\/i>.\u00a0 It would be obviously incorrect to use such language did it consist of several wholly separate parcels of land.\u00a0 Section 37 further requires that a survey shall be made of the claim and a plat and field notes showing accurately the boundaries of the claim shall be prepared and that the boundaries of the claim shall be distinctly marked by monuments on the ground.\u00a0 This information must further be embodied in the application published in the newspapers, and must also be in the hands of the Government official who issues the patent.\u00a0 According to the description and plat of the land in this case only six posts were used in marking\u00a0 off the location of the appellees, and the river is nowhere referred to in the declaration as a boundary line.\u00a0 So that even were the proposition that noncontiguous parcels could be located under one patent admitted, it would be resigning everything to chaos to relinquish the requirement that each of the boundary lines should be accurately set forth in the records pertaining to the patent.\u00a0 Under no circumstances, therefore, can appellees' description of location be considered sufficient to properly present the five remaining parcels of land for a patent.<br\/><br\/>But we do not desire 'to dispose of this case upon this ground alone.\u00a0 The main question involved is whether the material which induced the appellees to apply for a patent is susceptible of location under the mining laws.\u00a0 On the witness stand Mr. Stevenson, who filed the declaration of location on behalf of himself and the other appellees, testified'as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Q. So, as a matter of actual fact, you located this (claim) for the gravel contained in it?\u2014A. Yes, sir.\"<\/blockquote>The evidence shows conclusively that the land in question was located solely for the purpose of obtaining therefrom ordinary, nonmetalliferous gravel.\u00a0 Can this gravel be located as a placer mineral claim?\u00a0 The law pertinent is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>Section 20 of the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902;\u00a0 \"That in all cases public lands in the Philippine Islands valuable for mineral shall be reserved from sale, except as otherwise expressly directed by law.\"<br\/><br\/>Section 21, ibid.:\u00a0 \"That all valuable mineral deposits in public lands in the Philippine Islands, both surveyed and unsurveyed, are hereby declared to be free and open to exploration, occupation,. and purchase, and the land in which they are found to occupation and purchase, by citizens of the United States, or of said Islands:\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\"<br\/><br\/>Section 41, ibid.:\u00a0 \"That any person authorized to enter lands under this Act may enter and obtain patent to lands that are chiefly valuable for building stone under the provisions of this Act relative to placer mineral claims.\"<br\/><br\/>Section 36, ibid., as amended by Act of Congress of February 6, 1905: \"That the United States Philippine Commission or its successors may make regulations, not in conflict with the provisions of this Act, governing the location, manner of recording, and amount of work necessary to hold possession of a mining claim, subject to the following requirements;\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.\"<\/blockquote>Section 1 of Act No. 624\u00a0 of the Philippine Commission reads; \"The term 'mineral claim' as used in these regulations shall be understood to mean 'lode claim' and the term 'mining claim' shall be understood to include both 'lode' and placer' claims.\u00a0 A placer claim shall be understood to mean a claim of land more valuable\u00a0 for placer mining, stone quarrying, or for the securing of earth for use in tile, brick, pottery, paint, or other manufacture, or of petroleum, guano, or other mineral product, than for other purposes.\u00a0 The rules and regulations for the securing of claims so defined as placer claims shall be as for placer claims as mentioned in this Act.\"<br\/><br\/>It is unnecessary to discuss the question raised in argument as to whether section 1 of Act No. 624 is altogether in harmony with the sections of the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902, which are quoted, <i>supra<\/i>.\u00a0 The latter Act specifies the substances that are susceptible of location, and the Insular Legislature can neither increase nor decrease the list.\u00a0 Upon this point the Congress has legislated, and its will is supreme.\u00a0 None will object to positing the statement that gravel such as the appellees seek to locate as a placer mining claim (and which for convenience will hereafter be called commercial gravel) must be classified either as a mineral or as <i>building<\/i> stone.\u00a0 And in the absence of particularity as to what those substances are, recourse must be had to the books to determine whether a particular thing is included within \"mineral deposit\" or \"building stone.\"<br\/><br\/>It is true that commercial gravel belongs to the mineral kingdom in that it is inorganic and that it is formed by nature alone.\u00a0 But there is an important distinction between it and any of the so-called minerals as recognized by the authorities.\u00a0 Practically\u00a0 speaking, all the definitions of the word \"mineral\" agree that such\u00a0 a substance must always have a definite chemical composition by which it can be easily recognized, in whatever part of the earth it may be found.\u00a0 There can be no such uniformity in the chemical content of gravel deposits, for the reason that this depends entirely upon the character of the mineral deposits which have contributed to their formation.\u00a0 And upon the character, quantity, and proximity of the minerals to the gravel deposit, their susceptibility to erosion, the violence with which the erosion is accompanied, the duration of the eroding process, as well as various other facts, depends the\u00a0 size of the pebbles and the quality of the deposit as commercial gravel.\u00a0 There is nothing constant in the character of commercial gravel by which to identify it as a mineral, except that it consists of broken fragments of rock mingled with finer material, such as sand and clay.\u00a0 Nothing\u00a0 definite can be said of its chemical composition as can be said of the minerals.\u00a0 Commercial gravel is simply a jumbled mass of fragments of various minerals (rocks). Science, at least, cannot accept as a distinct subdivision of the mineral kingdom any substance whose character and attributes are so composite and fluctuating.\u00a0 It is true that beds of sandstone and limestone may possibly owe their origin in some instances to deposits of ordinary gravel,\u00a0 (Barringer and Adams on The Law of Mines and Mining in the\u00a0 United States; Enc. Brit, 11th ed., Title \"Gravel.\")\u00a0 But commercial gravel has not yet reached that stage.\u00a0 So far as scientific classification goes, then, commercial gravel cannot be considered as a mineral.<br\/><br\/>But it is urged, and rightly, that the <i>legal<\/i> definition of \"mineral\" is not in accord with the strict scientific definition of the term, and that it includes substances such as coal, asphalt, phosphate rock, etc., which, strictly speaking, probably owe their\u00a0 origin to vegetable or animal life of past ages.\u00a0 As commercial gravel cannot be classified as a mineral, strictly speaking, it\u00a0 remains to be seen whether it may be so classified under the broader legal signification which the term \"mineral\" has acquired.<br\/><br\/>The leading English case of Hext <i>vs<\/i>.

Cas., 429, 441) has often been quoted with approval:<br\/><blockquote>\"A reservation of 'minerals' includes every substance which can\u00a0 be got from underneath the surface of the earth for the purpose of profit, unless there is something in the context or in the nature of the transaction to induce the court to give it a more limited meaning.\"<\/blockquote>The United States Land Department, whose decisions on the subject are recognized as of quasi judicial authority, announced the rule many years\u00a0 ago as follows;<br\/><blockquote>\"Whatever is recognized\u00a0 as a mineral by the standard authorities\u00a0 on the\u00a0 subject, where the same is found in quantities and quality to render the land sought to be patented more valuable on this account than for the purpose of agriculture, should be treated by the office as coming within the purview of the mining act of May 10,\u00a0 1872.\"\u00a0 (Circular of Instructions, July 15, 1873.)<\/blockquote>The Department has relied upon this definition many times in the course of its administration of the mining laws.\u00a0 During this time the definition has met with neither legislative nor judicial disapproval, and it consequently is deserving of great weight as an interpretation of the law by the executive department of the Government.\u00a0 Indeed, of all the definitions to be found, it is probably the least misleading, for the reason that \"mineral\" in a legal sense is no longer bound up in the etymology of the word, and the only method of determining its scope is to ascertain what is included within it by legal authorities.<br\/><br\/>Assuming that the gravel deposits which the appellees seek to locate could be worked at a profit, it might appear that commercial gravel would fall within the scope of the above definitions.\u00a0 If, however, an examination be made of the individual adjudicated cases and the decisions of the United States Land Department, upon which these general definitions of the term \"mineral\" are based, it will be found that commercial gravel\u00a0 was not a factor in forming them, and that it has never been considered as a mineral.\u00a0 It is as completely excluded from the legal definition of the term by the silence of the books on the subject as it is eliminated from any technical discussion of the subject by the failure to consider it at all.\u00a0 Nor can such exclusion be attributed to ignorance of its existence as has been the case with certain minerals which scientific investigation has but recently discovered, and whose discovery has necessitated widening the meaning of the term \"mineral\" so as to include them.\u00a0 Commercial gravel and its uses, at least for road making and the like, have been known from time immemorial.<br\/><br\/>To the argument that the general legal definitions with which we started would include commercial gravel as a mineral, we reply\u00a0 that such generalities lose their potency under the circumstances.\u00a0\u00a0 They are not based upon a fundamental and universal law of nature.\u00a0 On the contrary, they are merely attempts to summarize the numerous decisions of courts of last resort dealing, in specific cases, with specific\u00a0 minerals.\u00a0 It is not claimed for them that they are either inclusive or exclusive, and their value is little more than a list of such minerals would be.\u00a0 Such lists are easily accessible.\u00a0 Lindley on Mines (2d ed.) exhausts both\u00a0 the English and American authorities (sees. 85 to 98), as does the monographic note to Dwinnell <i>vs<\/i>. Dyer (7 L. R. A. (N. S.), 763, 805).\u00a0 And as stated above, commercial gravel is not included in any of them.<br\/><br\/>The Act of May 10, 1872, was much more elaborately drawn than either of its predecessors, supersedes them in most important respects, and is, to all intents and purposes, the present law on the subject in the United States.\u00a0 Our own law is, essentially, its counterpart.\u00a0 In these general mining laws, as well as in other laws more or less related to the subject, no attempt was made by Congress to define the term \"mineral.\"\u00a0 Lindley on Mines (2d ed.), after reviewing\" the above-cited laws and several others of minor importance, says (sec. 86):<br\/><blockquote>\"No legislative interpretation or definition of the term 'mineral lands,' which were so reserved and excepted, was ever attempted.\u00a0 This was left for judicial or departmental construction.\"<\/blockquote>It is thus clear that in the enactment of legislation on the subject of mines and mining, Congress was content to accept the decisions of the other departments of the Government at the time of the various enactments upon the question of what was a mineral.\u00a0 The only legislative expressions of what should be included within the term as used in the mining laws are to be found in the Act of August 4, 1892, declaring building stone patentable under the provisions of law relating to placer mineral claims; the Act of February 11, 1897, making a like\u00a0 provision for petroleum; and the Act of January 31, 1901, by which saline lands could be patented in the same manner.<br\/><br\/>It is generally conceded that the first two of these three laws were enacted to definitely include building stone and petroleum within the operation of the general mining laws, rulings of the judicial and executive departments of the Government at the time\u00a0 of their passage being conflicting as to the mineral character of these substances.\u00a0 During the last half century and more, since it first legislated upon the subject, Congress has simply allowed the courts and the Land Department to determine what should be included within the meaning of the expression, interfering only when error had been committed.\u00a0 It is true that there appears to have been no ruling made by either of these departments (with the exception of one case which\u00a0 is discussed below) on the question whether commercial gravel is a mineral.\u00a0 Why the question has never arisen, whether because no one has ever desired to locate deposits of commercial gravel or because would be locators have concluded that it was not susceptible to location under the mining laws, we cannot say.\u00a0 But it is clear that it cannot be legitimately considered as a mineral in any scientific sense of the word, because it has been persistently ignored in all the treatises on mineralogy and kindred subjects.\u00a0 And to hold that the term \"mineral\" as used in the Act of July 1, 1902, includes commercial gravel, it would seem necessary to conclude that Congress intended to include within it a\u00a0 substance which, despite its frequency and the variety of the uses to which it was put at the time of the passage of the\u00a0 Act, had never been considered as coming within the term by any recognized authority.\u00a0 At the time of the passage of this Act, the use of commercial gravel in concrete construction was commonly known.\u00a0 It might almost be considered as indispensable to concrete work and, as such, and in view of the untold possibilities of concrete, to be of more importance to the commercial world than kaolin or China clay, for instance, which had been recognized as a mineral.\u00a0 Yet no effort was made to recognize by legislative enactment that which all the world had refused to do-that it was a mineral.<br\/><br\/>In Zimmerman <i>vs<\/i>. Brunson (39 L. D., 310, 1911), the United States Land Department was called upon to decide for the first time whether commercial' gravel could be located as a placer mineral claim.\u00a0 In that case it was said:<br\/><br\/>\"Conceding that the twenty acres are chiefly valuable for their deposit of gravel and sand, which can be used in connection with cement forming concrete used in the construction of buildings, does such a deposit confer upon them a mineral character so as to except them from homestead entry?\"<br\/><br\/>After quoting the\u00a0 definition of a mineral as formulated by the Department in its Circular of Instructions issued in 1873 (quoted <i>supra<\/i>), it was said:\u00a0 <br\/><blockquote>\"A\u00a0 search of the\u00a0 standard American authorities has failed to disclose a single one which classifies a deposit such as claimed in this case as mineral, nor is the Department aware of any application to purchase such &amp; deposit under the mining laws.\u00a0 This, taken into consideration with the further fact that deposits of sand and gravel occur with considerable frequency in the public domain, points rather to a general understanding that such deposits, unless they possess a peculiar property or characteristic\u00a0 giving them special value, were not to be regarded as mineral.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"The Department, in the absence of special legislation by Congress, will refuse to classify as mineral, land containing a deposit of material not recognized by standard authorities as such, whose sole use is for general building purposes, and whose chief value is its proximity to a town or city, in contradistinction to numerous other like deposits of the same character in the public domain.\"<\/blockquote>It has been suggested that commercial gravel should be classified as building stone in view of the fact that it is much used in concrete construction.<br\/><br\/>We have just discussed the only case that has been found dealing with commercial gravel, in which the Land Department held that it could not be located as a placer mineral claim merely on the strength of the fact that it is used in concrete construction work; but it appears that in this case an attempt was made to prove that it belonged to the minerals.\u00a0 The Land Department would hardly have refused to issue a patent to the claimant in that case had the gravel and sand been capable of location under any of the provisions of the mining laws as a building stone.\u00a0 As there was no discussion of whether commercial gravel could be classified as a building stone, the only inference that can be drawn is that neither the Department nor anyone connected with the case considered commercial gravel to be a building\u00a0 stone.\u00a0 Indirectly,\u00a0 at least, the United States Land Department has declined to consider commercial gravel as a building stone.\u00a0 An examination of the authorities on the subject shows that only stone taken from quarries where it is found <i>in place<\/i> has been favorably considered as building stone.\u00a0 Moreover, the mining laws of the United States do not deal with minerals or stone artificially made.\u00a0 Such substances, to come within\u00a0 the operation of those laws, must be found where they were formed or deposited by natural agencies.\u00a0 Concrete, if considered as a building\u00a0 stone at all, must nevertheless remain an artificial stone.\u00a0 No building stone needs an artificial process to establish its\u00a0 character.\u00a0 It is a building stone when found by man in its natural state.\u00a0 But commercial gravel is not concrete, but an ingredient only, and even though concrete be considered as a building stone, it would certainly be as inappropriate to call commercial gravel concrete as to call concrete commercial\u00a0 gravel.\u00a0 Under no circumstances can commercial gravel be called building stone, merely because it is commonly used in concrete construction work.<br\/><br\/>But there is another more potent reason for excluding commercial gravel from the operation of the mining laws, founded on the\u00a0 broad grounds of public policy.\u00a0 Solely upon the Government devolves the duty of construction and maintenance of the public highways-an imperative duty, the performance of which is absolutely\u00a0 essential\u00a0 to the development and progress of the country.\u00a0 For the Government to divest itself of the ownership\u00a0 of road-building materials in the face of its obligation to use them in the exercise of one of its most important functions would be extremely unwise.\u00a0 The recognized minerals are relatively of little importance to the operations of government.\u00a0 The bulk of them are all devoted to private purposes, and the sale of the public lands containing them has proven on the whole to be a wise policy and an incentive to their development.\u00a0 Inversely, the Government is the chief user of road building\" materials; and to dispose of them to private parties for the privilege of repurchasing them for use in the performance of a duty, the whole burden of which falls upon the Government,\u00a0 would be an anomalous proceeding, a measure which would enrich a few at the expense of the people at large.\u00a0 This argument has especial application in this country.\u00a0 The road system of these Islands is at present insufficient to satisfy the necessities of the country, and the Government is committed to a road-building policy.\u00a0 Great efforts are being made to develop an adequate network of highways throughout the length and breadth of the land; the Government has set for itself an enormous task which it is realized must extend over a period of many years and cost many millions.\u00a0 During the progress of this work, road-building materials will be necessary at every point; and the limited financial resources of the Government should not be further depleted by allowing such materials to be sold for a song in the bulk, with the inevitable necessity of immediately repurchasing them at so much per cubic meter.\u00a0 Were such a practice permitted, it would be an easy matter, and no doubt quite\u00a0 attractive in many instances, for private parties to acquire deposits of gravel and\u00a0 other road materials in strategic locations, with the certain knowledge that in the course of a few years a market for them would automatically result as a consequence of the road-building program of the Government.\u00a0 We do not wish to be understood as saying that deposits of commercial gravel on public lands are exclusively for the use of the Government.\u00a0 It is well known that gravel has at least one other <i>private<\/i> use of great importance (concrete construction), and in localities where there is enough and to spare for the needs of the Government, it would be eminently proper to dispose of the surplus on reasonable terms.\u00a0 But it would seem to be as eminently proper also for the Government to first reserve sufficient for its own needs in the discharge of an obligation it cannot escape.<br\/><br\/>Finally , the eminent authority, Lindley on Mines (2d ed.), section 96, formulates the following rule, after a review of the authorities, for the construction and interpretation of the mining laws:<br\/><blockquote>\"Where a statute operates as\u00a0 a grant of public property to an individual, or the relinquishment of a public interest, that construction should be adopted which will support the claim of the Government rather than that of the individual.\"<\/blockquote>This is merely an especial application of a general rule in the interpretation of all sorts of public grants of titles and franchises.\u00a0 (See Southerland on Stat. Const., sees. 387 <i>et seq<\/i>., where the subject is treated <i>in extenso<\/i>, and The Coosaw Mining Company <i>vs<\/i>. South Carolina (144 U.S., 550, 36 L. ed., 537), where the Federal Supreme Court unequivocally sustains the rule in the interpretation of a mining grant.)<br\/><br\/>We are of the opinion that commercial gravel is not patentable as a\u00a0 placer mineral claim under the law.\u00a0 So much of the decision of the\u00a0 lower court as continues the appellees in possession of the land situated above the highwater mark of the Moriones River, embraced within their description of location, must be reversed, and the Government restored to the possession of the land.\u00a0 Without costs.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Abreu, judge, dismissed the complaint and disallowed the counter-claim interposed by the defendant, without special finding as to costs.<br\/><br\/>By a written motion of July 15, 1910, counsel for the plaintiff requested:\u00a0 that it be finally held that the useful and necessary improvements which the latter had made, as the\u00a0 possessor in good faith of the properties specified in the\u00a0 complaint, amount to the total value of P14,900; that, before proceeding, in accordance with the judgment of July 8, 1909, with the division of the estate left by her husband, Donato Lelis, at his death, the estate of Maria Josue then under administration, to which belonged two-thirds of the inheritance from Donato Lelis, should pay to the plaintiff the P000, the amount of two-thirds of the debts which the plaintiff had paid, besides the sum of P9,933.34, the total value of two-thirds of the said improvements made by the plaintiff\u00a0 on the properties mentioned; and that a reasonable delay be granted to the said administration of the estate of Maria Josue for the reimbursement to the plaintiff of all the sums mentioned and, in case of nonpayment, that all the property specified be awarded to the plaintiff in satisfaction of the encumbrances on the property which belonged to the deceased Lelis.\u00a0 It was further requested that the costs be taxed against the defendant.\u00a0 In connection\u00a0 with the said motion plaintiff alleged:\u00a0 that, by virtue of a will executed by her husband, Donato Lelis, in 1883 in Sorsogon and duly recorded, the plaintiff had, since that year, when Lelis died, and as the sole heir by will, been in the quiet and peaceable possession of the parcels of land and the lots with their respective houses, specified in the complaint under paragraphs A to G, two of which are situated in different parts of Sorsogon; that, in the decision rendered by the Supreme Court on December 23, 1908, in the civil case prosecuted by Acisclo Jimenez, as administrator of the estate of Maria Josue against Trinidad Bautista, now the plaintiff, it was recognized that the latter was entitled to a one-third interest in the aforesaid properties, by reason of the before mentioned will executed by Donato Lelis, and the heirs of Maria Josue to two-thirds of the estate left by the deceased Lelis; that, during the twenty-five years and while the plaintiff had in good faith been holding the said properties by reason of the said will, she had made improvements thereon as follows: on the parcel of land A, to the value of P2,000; on parcel B, P500; parcel C, P300; parcel D, P300; parcel E, P400; parcel F, P400; and on parcel G, in rebuilding the house thereon constructed and keeping the same in a state of repair, P8,000 and P2,000, respectively.<br\/><br\/>Thus, the useful improvements made on the said properties amounted to P11,100, and the necessary improvements to P3,800, and were effected by the plaintiff during the said twenty-five years that she was in possession of the said properties as the owner thereof under her husband's will; that, by final judgment of the court, it was held that the plaintiff was entitled to a credit of P2,000 for the two-thirds of the testator's debts which she had paid; that therefore, before proceeding to divide the said property, now under the plaintiff's control, she should be reimbursed the sum above mentioned; and that, up to the date of the complaint, Trinidad Bautista\u00a0 had not yet been paid the value of the improvements.<br\/><br\/>By a ruling of October 4, 1910, the court sustained the demurrer to the complaint.\u00a0 Therefore the plaintiff, on the 6th of the same month, presented a supplementary complaint wherein her counsel reproduced each and all of the facts alleged in the principal complaint and added that the useful improvements made on parcel A, including the cost of clearing and bringing under cultivation ground for the planting of 50,000 hemp plants, expenses of maintenance, and taxes from 1902 to 1910, amounted to a total of P5,000.<br\/><br\/>Necessary improvements made in clearing, bringing under cultivation and upkeeping parcel B, amounted to P500; clearing and first plowing were done on parcel C to the value of P300; necessary improvements on parcel D, relating to its upkeep and the repairs required on account of typhoons, amounted to P300; improvements made on parcel E, in connection with new plantings and the preservation of the property, P340; on parcel F, improvements for the preservation of the property which, during the last twenty years, amounted to P400; on parcel G a building, erected of wood and masonry, adjoining the small house left by the testator, and enclosed by a wall 45 meters in circumference, and another wall of stone, 182 meters long, constructed around the entire parcel.\u00a0 All these improvements amounted to P8,000, the total of the expenditure detailed in the complaint.\u00a0 For the preservation of this building repairs were made, after the typhoons of 1883 and 1905, costing P1,000 on each of these two occasions.<br\/><br\/>It was further alleged that the total cost of the improvements made amounted to P14,900 and that all those mentioned were for the benefit of the said urban and rural properties which, had they not been improved, would not now exist; therefore, the plaintiff prayed that the defendant be sentenced in all respects in accordance with the plaintiff's petition contained in his principal complaint.<br\/><br\/>The demurrer presented by the defendant having been overruled, the latter, in his written answer of November 7, 1910, admitted paragraphs 1, 3, and 6 of the complaint and denied generally and specifically each and all of the\u00a0 allegations contained in paragraphs 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8 of the same, with the exception of the facts explicitly admitted in the counterclaim.<br\/><br\/>As a special defense, counsel for the defendant alleged that the plaintiff lost all right to make any claim for improvements made on the property, which was the subject matter of another action, then terminated and decided, wherein the administrator Jimenez was the plaintiff, and Trinidad Bautista the defendant, because he failed then to set up the proper counterclaim, if he believed himself entitled so to do, in accordance with the provisions of section 97 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br\/><br\/>In the counterclaim he alleged:\u00a0 that, on July 23, 1906, Barbara Lelis and the administrator Jimenez filed a suit against the present plaintiff, Trinidad Bautista, for the recovery of possession of the property left by the deceased Donato Lelis, which suit was decided by the Supreme Court on December 23, 1908,<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> in favor of the plaintiffs, whereby they were awarded two-thirds of the estate of the said Lelis, and Trinidad Bautista the other one-third of the same, and it was ordered in that decision that the cause be remanded to the lower court for the purpose of a new trial to determine the indebtedness of the deceased testator that was paid by his widow Bautista; that the court, on July 8, 1909, rendered judgment at the new trial, finding that Lelis' debts paid by his widow amounted to P3,000, and that, therefore, the heirs of Maria Josue must pay to Trinidad Bautista P2,000, two-thirds of such indebtedness; that, since the 25th of July, 1905, the date of the complaint for the recovery of possession, the plaintiff Bautista had not rendered accounts of the products of the property which she retained under her control, nor shared them with the heirs of Maria Josue, notwithstanding the repeated demands made upon her so to do, which products amounted to P15,000; and therefore two-thirds of this sum, belonging to the heirs of Maria Josue, amounted to P10,000, from which was to be deducted the P2,000 owed by those heirs to the plaintiff Bautista, leaving a remainder of P8,000 to be paid to them by the latter, as her share of the value of the products.\u00a0 The defendant, accordingly, prayed that judgment be rendered in\u00a0 his favor by sentencing the plaintiff to deliver to him two-thirds of the estate left by Donato Lelis, pursuant\u00a0 to the decision of the Supreme Court, and that, after deducting the P2,000 from the sum of P10,000, she deliver to him the remainder, as his share of the two-thirds of the products of the property detained, and also pay to the defendant P2,000 for each year that should elapse until a complete division and an adjudication of two-thirds of the property in plaintiff's possession be made with the costs of the trial upon the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the latter, on November 8, 1910, made a written general denial of the facts alleged by the defendant in his special defense and admitted the facts A, B, and C of the counterclaim, denying fact D, and alleged that the plaintiff had not rendered accounts to the administrator of the estate of Maria Josue for the reason that the said administrator had not paid to the plaintiff the P2,000 mentioned in the decision of he Supreme Court of July 8, 1909, and as ordered therein.<br\/><br\/>The trial having been held and evidence adduced by both parties, the court, on January 12,1911, rendered judgment, which was excepted to by the plaintiff, who duly filed the proper bill of exceptions, which was approved and forwarded to the clerk of this court.<br\/><br\/>In the present action, a demand was made for the payment of the two-thirds of the useful and necessary improvements that the plaintiff alleges she made on the said rural and urban properties, which payment should have been made to the administrator of the estate of Maria Josue, and the judge, abstaining from deciding whether the plaintiff was or was not entitled to two-thirds of the improvements, confined himself to a determination of the question of law raisedby\u00a0 the defendant in his special defense and held that the plaintiff, Trinidad Bautista, had lost all right to demand reimbursement for the said improvements, pursuant to the provisions of section 97 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions, because she had not, in the previous suit brought by the administrator of the estate of the said deceased Maria Josue, through a counterclaim, presented the said claim for reimbursement for the improvements made on the property willed to her by her late husband Donato Lelis.<br\/><br\/>In the previous action instituted in the same court of Sorsogon by the administrator of the estate of the deceased Maria Josue and\u00a0 by the latter's daughter, Barbara Lelis, against Trinidad Bautista, a decision was rendered by the Supreme Court (No. 3394, 12 Phil. Rep., 322) reversing the judgment of the trial court and holding that the property left by Donato Lelis at his death was not conjugal property; that the latter could not by will deprive his forced heirs of their interest in the property; that his testamentary heiress was entitled to a one-third interest in his estate; and that such heiress could recover the proportional part of the debts of the deceased which she had paid before the said forced heirs could receive the shares belonging to them under the law.<br\/><br\/>The action brought by the administrator of the estate of Maria Josue and by the latters daughter, Barbara Lelis, in the previous suit, was really one of petition for the inheritance, founded on the hereditary right that pertained to the parents of Donato Lelis, to wit, Teodoro Lelis and Maria Josue, as such\u00a0 parents' forced heirs, pursuant to article 935 of the Civil Code; and, as Trinidad Bautista did not in that suit present a counterclaim for reimbursement for the improvements, as she does in the present case, it was held in the judgment appealed from that the said Bautista was no longer entitled to demand payment for the said improvements.<br\/><br\/>Section 97 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the provisions of which are the grounds of the judgment which disallows the plaintiff's claim, provides as follows: <br\/><blockquote>\"If the right out of which the counterclaim arises exists at the time of\u00a0 the commencement of the action and arises out of the transaction set forth in the complaint as the foundation of the plaintiff's\u00a0 claim, or is necessarily connected with the subject of the action, neither the defendant nor his assignee can afterwards maintain an action against the plaintiff therefor if the defendant omits to set up a counterclaim for the same.\u00a0 But if the counterclaim arises out of transactions distinct from those set forth in the complaint as the foundation of the plaintiff's claim and not connected with the subject of the action, the defendant shall not be barred from any subsequent action upon such counterclaim by reason of his failure to set it up in his answer to the pending answer.\"<\/blockquote>In the previous suit the issue was whether Barbara Lelis, the heir of the deceased parents of the testator, Donato Lelis, under the rule of representation, was entitled to the legal portion which pertained to those parents by operation of law, notwithstanding the will of Donato Lelis, the husband of the plaintiff, Trinidad Bautista; and although the action of petition for the inheritance had for its positive final object the recovery of the property\u00a0 of which the said inheritance consisted, the principal object and the fundamental purpose of the said action was to obtain a recognition and a judicial declaration of such right to such legal portion as pertained to the parents of the deceased testator, since the latter's sister, Barbara Lelis, only represented the rights which she had inherited from her parents.\u00a0 Therefore, upon the institution of the previous action claiming the inheritance in question, it cannot be conceived that there already existed in the plaintiffs behalf a right to the useful and necessary improvements made on the properties of which the inheritance claimed by the abintestate heir consisted, inasmuch as the plaintiff Bautista held the property which her husband left her at his death, under a probated will, which instrument of itself constitutes a sufficient deed of transfer, in her favor, of the ownership of the said property; and further, since, from what was alleged in the complaint which initiated the said first suit, filed by the administrator of the estate of the deceased Maria Josue and by the latter's daughter, Barbara Lelis, it is not possible to deduce any motive or right whatever on which could have been founded an action seeking payment for the improvements in question, which have no necessary connection with the hereditary right claimed in that suit.\u00a0 Consequently Trinidad Bautista, the defendant in that litigation, was neither entitled nor obliged to present a counter- claim for payment for the improvements, which she now claims in the present action.<br\/><br\/>If the said administrator and Barbara Lelis had not brought the action of petition for the inheritance, and if the courts had not declared that the parents of the testator were entitled to a part of the estate of Donato Lelis, notwithstanding his will, the, latter's widow, Trinidad Bautista, who inherited from her husband and entered into possession of his estate by virtue of his will, would always have continued in the possession and enjoyment of the hereditary property as the legitimate owner thereof.\u00a0 The widow Bautista is now obliged to deliver to her sister-in-law a part of the property which she, the former, had by will inherited from Donato Lelis, inasmuch as, in conformity with the claim made by Bautista as the heir of the deceased parents of the testator, the courts had to recognize such parents' right to a part of the property which constitutes the inheritance left by Donato Lelis at his death, notwithstanding his aforementioned will.<br\/><br\/>Thus the claim for the payment of the improvements is founded on\u00a0 a right which originated at the time the courts decided the question raised by the heiress and successor of the rights of the parents of the deceased testator\u2014a claim in no wise connected with the principal object of the previous litigation.\u00a0 Therefore the aforesaid widow, who avers that she made improvements for the benefit of the property which constitutes the inheritance that is to be the subject of partition between herself and the heiress of her husband's parents, is not barred from bringing the action to enforce her claim for reimbursement for the improvements in question.\u00a0 Trinidad Bautista opposed the claim presented in the previous suit and asked for the inheritance of her deceased husband; she defended herself with the will executed by the latter, by reason of which instrument she believed herself, in good faith, to be the owner and lawful possessor of the property which she had inherited by will.\u00a0 It was therefore improper to require of her, as testamentary heir, that she should have demanded by counterclaim the value of the improvements that she made, for, until the judgment rendered in the previous suit, whereby the plaintiff's right was defined, became final, Bautista was firmly convinced that she was the lawful owner of the property claimed by her in good faith.<br\/><br\/>If the present plaintiff had then claimed the value of the improvements, she would have recognized the right which Barbara Lelis alleged she then had to the property which this plaintiff was holding in good faith by reason of her husband's will.\u00a0 That she should have done so, could not reasonably have been required of Trinidad Bautista, then the defendant, during the controversy, not over the estate left by the testator Lelis at his death, but over the hereditary right alleged by the latter's sister in representation of her parents in a part of the estate.<br\/><br\/>On these grounds the trial judge should have disallowed the special defense alleged by the defendant and treated the issue pending with regard to the improvements as one not decided, since that issue was not raised, discussed, or disposed of in the previous suit.<br\/><br\/>Under such premises, and the question of law having been decided, as to whether the plaintiff Bautista may still claim in this suit reimbursement for the improvements concerned, and, further, in view of the fact that, as a new trial was not asked for, a review of the evidence may not be had in this case, we deem it proper to remand the case to the Court of First Instance in order that the petitions by the plaintiff in her complaint, and those by the defendant in his written answer, may be disposed of in accordance with law.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment appealed from is reversed and it is ordered that this case be remanded to the Court of First Instance whence it originated, together with a certified copy of this decision, in order that the judge may decide the claims of both\u00a0 parties in accordance with law and the evidence adduced at trial, and determine the value of the improvements.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

ANTONIO PARRONE, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>JOHNSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">This defendant was charged with the crime of the falsification of\u00a0 a personal cedula.\u00a0 The complaint was as follows :<br\/><blockquote>\"That on or about February 24, 1908, in the barrio of Roosevelt, municipality of Calabanga, Province of Ambos Camarines, the said\u00a0 accused Antonio Parrone did maliciously, criminally and unlawfully alter and falsify his personal cedulas Nos. B222063, series of 1906, and A435197, series of 1907, by substituting for his own surname 'Parrone' as it appeared on said cedulas, that of 'Partacio' the surname of one Antonio Partacio, and then delivering them to said Partacio in payment of the sum of P2.20, which the latter had given said accused.\"<\/blockquote>After hearing the\u00a0 evidence, the Honorable Herbert D. Gale, judge, found the defendant guilty of the crime charged and sentenced him\u00a0 to be imprisoned for a period of three years and to pay a fine of P200, and in case of insolvency to suffer subsidiary imprisonment, in accordance with the provisions of section 55 of Act No. 1189 of the Philippine Commission.<br\/><br\/>From that sentence the defendant appealed to this court.\u00a0 The only question presented here by the appellant is one of fact.\u00a0 From an examination of the evidence, the following facts seem to be established beyond a reasonable doubt: <ol> <li>That in each of the years\u00a0 1906 and 1907, Antonio Partacio delivered to the defendant herein money for the purchase of his personal cedula for said years.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>That in the year 1908, the said Antonio Partacio arranged with Severo Abad for the purchase by the latter for the former of the municipal treasurer, Rufino P. Ponte, of his personal cedula for said year.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>That when the said Severo Abad attempted to purchase the said cedula for Antonio Partacio, for the\u00a0 year 1908, the treasurer requested that\u00a0 (Abad) exhibit the cedula of Antonio Partacio for the year 1907.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>That Abad notified Partacio of the necessity of having his cedula for the year 1907, in order to purchase his cedula for the year 1908,\u00a0 without having to pay a penalty; that then Partacio notified Abad that the defendant was in possession of his cedulas for the years 1906 and 1907; that Abad then went to the defendant for the purpose of securing the cedulas of the said Partacio for the said years; that the defendant delivered to Abad two cedulas marked Exhibits A and B (pages 34 and 35).\u00a0 Later Abad again appeared at the office of the municipal treasurer, exhibiting the two cedulas, for the purpose of purchasing the cedula for the year 1908 for Partacio.\u00a0 The treasurer and his clerk noted that the cedulas, Exhibits A and B, for the years 1906 and 1907, had been changed.\u00a0 They were then in the name of Antonio Partacio.\u00a0 'the municipal treasurer, Ponte, examined his records and found that the numbers of the cedulas corresponding to Exhibits A and B in his registry showed that the same had been delivered to Antonio Parrone, the defendant, and not to Antonio Partacio.<\/li><\/ol>During the trial of the cause in the lower court the defendant denied that he had ever purchased cedulas for Antonio Partacio and tried to make it appear that he had lost the cedulas, Exhibits A and B, and that they had been found and altered by some other person than himself.\u00a0 The trial judge did not believe this\u00a0 theory of the defendant.\u00a0 There seems to be no reason why the witnesses for the Government should have sworn falsely with reference to the method by which they obtained the possession of Exhibits A and B.\u00a0 Their declarations were direct and positive.\u00a0 The facts contained in the record are sufficient to convince us, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant made the alterations complained of in said Exhibits A and B.\u00a0 <br\/><br\/>The crime described in the complaint at the time of its commission was punishable under section 55 of Act No. 1189.\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Morales, 14 Phil. Rep., 227.)\u00a0 The penalty provided by that section (55) was a fine in the sum of not less than P2,000 nor more than P10,000 and imprisonment for a term\u00a0 of not less than one year nor more than five years, in the discretion of the court.\u00a0 Said Act and said section (Act No. 1189, sec. 55) were amended by Act No. 2126 of the Philippine Legislature on the 1st day of February, 1912.\u00a0 The punishment provided by said amendment for the crime described in the complaint in the present cause is a fine in a sum not less than P200 nor more than P500, or by imprisonment for a term of not less than two months nor more than five years, or both, in the discretion of the court.\u00a0 The alleged offense in the present case was committed\u00a0 upon the 24th day of February, 1908, nearly four years before the amendment to said law. It will be noted that the penalty in the new law is more favorable to the defendant than that provided for by the old.<br\/><br\/>In the case of United States <i>vs<\/i>. Cuna (12 Phil. Rep., 241) we decided that where an Act of the Commission or of the Philippine Legislature, which penalizes an offense, repeals a former Act which penalized the same offense, such repeal does not have the effect of thereafter depriving the courts of jurisdiction to try, convict, and sentence offenders charged with violations of the old law prior to its repeal.\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Aron, 12 Phil. Rep., 778; U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Bernarda, 12 Phil. Rep., 778; U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Tonga, 15 Phil. Rep., 43; U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Kulang, 15 Phil. Rep., 634; U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Gaffud, 15 Phil. Rep., 634; U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Dumon, 15 Phil. Rep., 635;\u00a0 U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Dayag, 15 Phil. Rep., 635; U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Molina, 17 Phil. Rep.,\u00a0 582.)<br\/><br\/>It would seem, therefore, from the foregoing decisions that inasmuch as the crime was committed before the above amendment (Act No. 2126), that the punishment of the former law (Act No. 1189) should be imposed.\u00a0 By virtue of the provisions of article 22 of the Penal Code, however, penal laws shall have a retroactive effect in so far as they favor the person guilty of a felony or misdemeanor, even though at the time of the promulgation of such laws a final sentence has been pronounced and the convict is serving same.\u00a0 Article 7 of the Penal Code states that \"offenses punishable under\u00a0 special laws are not subject to the provisions of this Code.\"\u00a0 If Act No. 1189 and its amendment, Act No. 2126, are special laws, and we hold that they are, then we have the question presented, in view of the provisions of said article 7, whether or not parties convicted under said Acts (Nos. 1189 and 2126) can claim the benefits of article 22 provided the punishment created by the amendment is more favorable to the accused than the original law.\u00a0 Act No. 2126 provides a lesser punishment than Act No. 1189.\u00a0 It is, therefore, favorable to the accused.<br\/><br\/>In the case of Tavera <i>vs<\/i>. Valdez (1 Phil. Rep., 468) we decided, in discussing article 22, that said article has\u00a0 no application where the later law is expressly made inapplicable to pending actions or existing causes of action.\u00a0 In said Act No. 2126 there was no provision made for the continuance in force of the former law (Act No. 1189) as to pending actions or existing causes of action. In other words, Act No. 2126 took effect upon its passage and was applicable, certainly to all cases arising after the date of its enactment.<br\/><br\/>In the case of United States <i>vs<\/i>. Cuna (12 Phil. Rep.,241) this court expressly reserved its opinion as to whether article 22 of the Penal Code was applicable to Acts of the Philippine Commission or Legislature so as to require the imposition of the penalty provided in the repealing Act in case such penalty should be more favorable to the accused than that prescribed in the former Act.\u00a0 The Act of the Commission involved in this case was less favorable to the accused than the Act which it repealed.<br\/><br\/>In the case of United States <i>vs<\/i>. Herrero (10 Phil. Rep., 752, Notes), we decided that notwithstanding the provisions of Act No. 1773, the offended party still had the right to pardon, or remit the penalty imposed by the provisions of the Penal Code for the <i>offenses<\/i>, mentioned in said Act (No. 1773), <i>which had been committed prior to its enactment<\/i> (October 11, 1907).\u00a0 Act No. 177? was an amendment of certain sections of the Penal Code and contained nothing which was more favorable to the accused party than the provisions amended.\u00a0 There was, therefore, no occasion to discuss the question whether or not article 22 of the Penal Code applied to the new law (No. 1773).<br\/><br\/>In the case of United States et al. <i>vs<\/i>. Hocbo (12 Phil. Rep., 304) in discussing Act No. 1773 (the Act which made certain private crimes under the Penal Code public crimes) we held \"that all amendments to the law (Penal Code) which are beneficial to the defendant should be given retroactive effect in so far as they favor the accused, when the acts\u00a0 complained of had been committed while the old law was still in force.\"<br\/><br\/>In that case (U. S. et al. <i>vs<\/i>. Hocbo) one Laureana Igle presented a complaint against Leodegario Hocbo charging him with the crime of seduction, alleging that the crime had been committed in the month of September, 1906.\u00a0 Act No. 1773 made the crime of seduction a public crime.\u00a0 It went into effect upon the 11th day of October, 1907.\u00a0 The crime charged, therefore, had been committed more than a year before the new law went into effect.\u00a0 Act No. 1773 was an amendment of the Penal Code and cannot be considered a <i>special penal<\/i> law.\u00a0 This act in no way changed the penalties fixed for the crimes mentioned therein.\u00a0 The Penal Code gave the offended party, in the crime of seduction, the right to pardon the offender.\u00a0 Section 2 of said Act No. 1773 <i>prohibited the pardon<\/i> of the penalty imposed by the law by the aggrieved party.\u00a0 We held (U. S. et al. <i>vs<\/i>. Hocbo) that the\u00a0 right of pardon given under the provisions of the Penal Code was favorable to the offending party.\u00a0 Act No. 1773 only applied to crimes\u00a0 committed after the passage of that Act.\u00a0 The Act itself said that \"<i>hereafter<\/i> these private crimes shall be considered public crimes.\"\u00a0 The right of pardon, which the offended party had under the provisions of the Penal Code, she still possessed for a crime committed prior to Act No.\u00a0 1773, even though the trial did\u00a0 not occur until after the passage of said Act.\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Cuna, 12 Phil. Rep., 241.)\u00a0 The Penal Code, therefore, being more favorable to the offending party than its amendment (Act No. 1773), there was no occasion for the application of article 22 of the Penal Code.<br\/><br\/>In many cases we have held that the provisions of the Penal Code relating to subsidiary imprisonment did not apply to the penal laws of the Philippine Commission or to special decrees of the Kingdom of Spain by reason of the\u00a0 provisions of article 7 of the Penal\u00a0 Code.\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Hutchinson, 5 Phil. Rep., 343 (Acts Nos. 610, 652); U.S. <i>vs<\/i>. Glefonea, 5 Phil. Rep., 570\u00a0 (Act No. 619); U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Lineses, 5 Phil. Rep., 631 (Act No. 292); U.

Rep., 122 (Act No. 1761.)\u00a0 <br\/><br\/>Considering the provisions of article 7 of the Penal Code, are the provisions of article 22 of the same Code applicable to the penal laws of the Philippine Islands other than the provisions of the Penal Code?\u00a0 Article 22 is found in chapter 1 of title 3 of the Penal Code.\u00a0 Said chapter is entitled <i>\"Penalties in General\"<\/i> Article21 of said title and chapter provides that \"no felony or misdemeanor\u00a0 shall be punishable by any penalty not prescribed by law prior to its commission.\"\u00a0 This article is general in its provisions and <i>in effect prohibits the Government from punishing any person for any felony or misdemeanor with any penalty which has not been prescribed by the law<\/i>.\u00a0 It (art. 21), therefore, can have no application to any of the provisions of the\u00a0 Penal Code for the reason that for every felony or misdemeanor defined in the Penal Code a penalty has been prescribed.<br\/><br\/>The provisions of article 21 can only be invoked therefore, when a person is being tried for a <i>felony<\/i> or a <i>misdemeanor for which no penalty has been prescribed by law.<\/i>\u00a0 Article 21 is not a penal provision.\u00a0 It neither defines a crime nor provides a punishment for one.\u00a0 It has simply announced the policy of the Government with reference to the punishment of alleged criminal acts.\u00a0 It is a guaranty to the citizen of the State\u00a0 that no <i>act<\/i> of his will be considered criminal until after the Government has made it so bylaw and has provided a penalty.\u00a0 It (art. 21) is a declaration that no person shall be subject to criminal prosecution for any act of his until after the State has <i>defined<\/i> the <i>misdemeanor<\/i> or <i>crime<\/i> and has <i>fixed a penalty therefor<\/i>.The doctrine announced by this section has been considered of so much importance to the citizens of a state that many of the States of the Union have been pleased\u00a0 to include its precepts in their constitutions or have so declared by express provision of law.<br\/><br\/>Article 22 provides that \"Penal laws shall have a retroactive effect in so far as they favor the person guilty of a felony or misdemeanor, although at the time of the publication of such laws a final sentence has been pronounced and the convict is serving same.\"\u00a0 This provision clearly has no direct application to the provisions of the Penal Code.\u00a0 Its (art. 22) application to the Penal Code can only be invoked where some former or subsequent law is under consideration.\u00a0 It must necessarily relate (1) to penal laws existing prior to the Penal Code, in which the penalty was less severe than those of the Penal Code; or (2) to laws enacted subsequent to the Penal Code, in which the penalty was more favorable to the accused.\u00a0 Rule 80, <i>Ley Provisional para la aplicacion de las disposiciones del Codigo Penal<\/i>.\u00a0 Under the provisions\u00a0 of said article 22, if a crime had been committed prior to the date of the Penal Code the punishment for which was more favorable to the accused than the provisions of the Penal Code, it is believed that the accused might invoke the provisions of said article (22) even though he was not placed upon trial until after the Penal Code went into effect.\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Cuna.<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup>)\u00a0 So also if by an amendment to the Penal Code or by a later special law the punishment for an act was made less severe than by the provisions of the Penal Code, then the accused person might invoke the provisions of said article.\u00a0 It appears to be clear, then, that article 22 of the Penal Code can only be invoked when the provisions of some other penal law than the provisions of the Penal Code are under consideration.\u00a0 In other words, the provisions of article 22 can only be invoked with reference to some other penal law.\u00a0 It has no application to the provisions of the Penal Code except in relation with some other law.\u00a0 It is not believed, therefore, that the Legislature in enacting article 7 of the Penal Code intended to provide that article 22 should not be applicable to special laws.<br\/><br\/>In consideration, then, of the provisions of article 22 in, relation with the more favorable provisions of Act No.2126, and in view of the nature of the offense in this case, we are of the opinion that the sentence of the lower court should be modified and that the defendant should be sentenced to be imprisoned for a period of two months and to pay a fine in the sum of P200 and costs.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

LINO RAMOS CALUBAQUIB, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>CARSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Isabela, convicting the defendant and appellant of the offense of contracting an illegal marriage in violation of article 471 of the Penal Code.\u00a0 The information charges that on or about May 22, 1912, in the municipality of Ilagan, Isabela Province, the defendant being then legitimately married to one Maria Libang, voluntarily, illegally, and criminally contracted a second marriage with another woman named Primitiva Badua, during the lifetime of his first wife.\u00a0 The trial court found the defendant guilty as charged, and sentenced him to imprisonment for six years and one day.<br\/><br\/>The record discloses that the defendant was lawfully married on February 16, 1910, to Maria Libang in the municipality of Tuguegarao, Cagayan Province, by the justice of the peace of that municipality, as shown by Exhibit A, which was duly admitted in evidence.\u00a0 The first marriage is not disputed, and defendant admitted that it had never been legally dissolved in any manner whatever.<br\/><br\/>Defendant was a Constabulary soldier and lived with his first wife in Tuguegarao until he was transferred for duty to Ilagan, Isabela Province.\u00a0 On May 22, 1912, defendant and the woman named Primitiva Badua presented themselves at the office of the justice of the peace of Ilagan, and were there and then married by the justice of the peace.\u00a0 The appellant represented himself to be a single man, and in proof of his claim exhibited to the justice of the peace his cedula showing him to be a single man.\u00a0 The certificate of this marriage executed by the justice of the peace was admitted in evidence and made a part of the record in the case.\u00a0 The justice of the peace testified that he performed the marriage ceremony and that all the formalities of the law were complied with, and his statement was corroborated by the testimony\u00a0 of Gavino Gumaru, deputy sheriff of Ilagan, and his wife, whose names are attached as witnesses to the marriage certificate, and who stated that they were present and witnessed the marriage ceremony.\u00a0 It further appears that immediately after this marriage ceremony the appellant and the woman Primitiva Badua began living together as husband and\u00a0 wife, and later reported to the girl's father that they had been married by the justice of the peace.<br\/><br\/>At the trial in the court below the appellant maintained that no marriage was ever legally celebrated between himself and Primitiva Badua, and while he admitted that she lived with him, he asserted that she did so merely as his concubine (<i>querida<\/i>).\u00a0 The woman Primitiva Badua who at the preliminary\u00a0 examination had testified that she and appellant were married, denied that fact at the trial in the Court of First Instance, and corroborated the statements of the defendant as to the\u00a0 nature of the relations between him and herself, and in explanation of her testimony at the preliminary investigation she charged that the justice of the pe,ace had instructed her how to testify, and that she had stated that the defendant was her husband because the justice of the peace had required her to do so.<br\/><br\/>The story of the defendant is that he went with the woman to the office of the justice of the peace on the night of May\u00a0 21, 1912, not for the purpose of getting married, but for the purpose of making some arrangement whereby he could secure the consent or approval of the justice of the peace to the relations of concubinage between himself and the woman.\u00a0 He says that the justice of the peace asked them a number of questions which he wrote down, and that thereafter the justice of the peace told him that he could take the woman and go away with her; that they did go and began living together that very night at the house of one Saturnina Jamias, where appellant was then staying.\u00a0 Defendant testified further that he himself returned the next morning to the office of the justice of the peace, who gave him several papers, which he took to Primitiva Badua for her signature.\u00a0 According to his statement the woman did not accompany him the next morning to the office of the justice of the\u00a0 peace, but remained at the house of Saturnina Jamias.\u00a0 The woman testified along the same line, and both claimed that\u00a0 they did not understand the contents of the papers.\u00a0 They claimed also that they told the justice of the peace on the night before that they did not want to get married but merely wanted him to arrange some way by which they could live together.<br\/><br\/>In rebuttal, the justice of the peace testified that the defendant and the woman Badua came to his house on the night of May 21 and\u00a0 told him that they wanted to be married; that he made some inquiries of them and told them to return the next morning and bring witnesses; that they did return the next morning and that he there and then performed the marriage ceremony to which reference has already been made.<br\/><br\/>The trial judge refused to believe the story told by the accused, and accepted the testimony of the justice of the peace as true, and there is nothing in the record which would justify us in disturbing his findings in this regard.\u00a0 Even without the evidence of the justice of the peace it would be difficult to believe the claim of the accused and the woman Badua that they thought the papers which were signed by them related merely to their right to live together in concubinage.\u00a0 It appears that both of them are persons of more than the average education and that they were both able to read and write.\u00a0 The defendant was a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">practicante<\/span> (hospital steward) in the Constabulary forces and his duties were such as to indicate that he was a man of more than ordinary education and ability.\u00a0 Under all the circumstances it seems highly improbable that\u00a0 the papers in question could have been signed and the various questions addressed to them by the justice-of the peace answered by the couple without their knowledge that they related to their marriage.\u00a0 Moreover it would seem highly improbable that two intelligent people should wake up a justice of the peace at 10 o'clock at night in order to obtain his permission and sanction to\u00a0 live together unless they contemplated matrimony.\u00a0 There is nothing in the record which would lead us to conclude that either of these parties was so simpleminded as to believe for a moment that the justice of the peace had authority to sanction or legally authorize their amorous relations without the performance of the marriage ceremony.\u00a0 The record shows\u00a0 that the woman had previously given birth to a child and that she was pregnant at the time\u00a0 when she called on the justice of the peace on the night of May 21.\u00a0 She stated as much to the justice of the peace and intimated that the defendant was the cause of her trouble and that she wanted to get married because she was afraid of her father.\u00a0 The natural conclusion from the record is that the defendant and the woman had been principals in\u00a0 an illicit amour which had been in progress for some time, and that they presented themselves to the justice of the peace\u00a0 for the purpose of getting\u00a0 married in order to appease the anger of the woman's father.<br\/><br\/>The father stated in his testimony that the defendant and his daughter went away at the time of the alleged marriage and remained away about a month; that later they returned to his house and lived there as man and wife, and told him that they had been married by the justice of the\u00a0 peace.\u00a0 He said furthermore that it was commonly rumored and generally understood that his daughter and the defendant had been married by the justice of the peace.\u00a0 The father was called as a witness for the. defense and at first he seemed to be inclined to shield the defendant, but taken as a whole his testimony strongly tends to support the case made out by the prosecution and to rebut the claim of the defendant that he was not married by the justice of the peace and that neither he nor the woman believed that they were married.<br\/><br\/>We are satisfied from the whole record that there is no reasonable\u00a0 doubt that the defendant and appellant contracted the second marriage in violation of the provisions of article 471 of the Penal Code, and that the judgment of conviction by the trial court should be affirmed.<br\/><br\/>No mitigating circumstances were found by the trial court or developed in the record, and the penalty should have been imposed in the medium degrees The trial court imposed the penalty in the minimum degree.\u00a0 We conclude that the sentence thus imposed, modified by substituting the penalty of eight years and one day of <i>prision mayor<\/i> for so much thereof as imposes the penalty of six years and one day of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">prision mayor<\/span>, should be affirmed with the costs of this instance against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Shuster (11\u00a0 Phil. Rep., 340) it was held that the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and Courts of First Instance, as fixed by section 9 of the Philippine Bill, may be added to but not diminished by the Philippine Legislature;.\u00a0 This holding has never been questioned, and it seems unnecessary now to discuss the grounds upon which it was based.\u00a0 Therefore, there will be sufficient reason for declaring the disputed provisions of Acts Nos. 2041 and 2131 repugnant to the Philippine Bill and, consequently, void, if they attempt to curtail the jurisdiction of Courts of First Instance where the title to realty is involved.\u00a0 The original jurisdiction of those courts extends to \"all civil actions which involve the title to or possession of real\u00a0 property, or of any interest therein,\" except in forcible entry and detainer cases.\u00a0 (Act\u00a0 No. 136, sec. 56, par. 2.) Some one has said that there is no more comprehensive word in the English language than the word \"all.\"\u00a0 If this word be given its natural and unrestricted meaning,there is no case involving the title to real estate which Courts of First Instance are not authorized to hear and determine under the Organic Law, and that being supreme, any Act of the Philimnne Legislature which\u00a0 attempts in any manner to curtaal such jurisdiction must be held void.\u00a0 Acts Nos. 2041 and 2131 confer original jurisdiction upon justices of the peace to try title to real estate and provide that it shall be exclusive in\u00a0 cases where the value of the property in litigation does not exceed P200.\u00a0 Is the word \"exclusiveysusceptible of a construction that would still give Courts of First Instance original jurisdiction to try title to real estate where the value of the property in litigation does not exceed P200?\u00a0 By no possible means can exclusive jurisdiction to try a specific class of cases be construed so as to permit of another court entertaining jurisdiction over such cases.\u00a0 To give a grant of unrestricted exclusive jurisdiction over a specific class of litigation to one court its only proper sense, all other courts must be barred from Exercising jurisdiction in such cases.\u00a0 To hold that another court has jurisdiction also in such cases is to destroy the grant of <i>exclusive<\/i> jurisdiction given to the first.\u00a0 It is no longer exclusive when shared by another court, but merely concurrent.\u00a0 Were the disputed provisions of Acts Nos. 2041 and 2131 allowed to stand, therefore, the necessary result would be to deprive Courts of First Instance of their original jurisdiction, to try cases where the title to realty valued at not more than P200 was involved.\u00a0 This applies, whether the phrase \"exclusive jurisdiction\" or \"exclusive original jurisdiction\" be used.\u00a0 Philippine Legislature can not deprive Courts of First of any of the jurisdiction conferred upon them by the Organic Law.\u00a0 Upon this ground alone, then, Acts Nos. 2041 and 2131, in so far as they attempt to confer exclusive original jurisdiction upon courts of justice of the peace to try cases involving the title to realty valued at not more than P200, must be declared void.<br\/><br\/>There remains to be considered the concurrent jurisdiction conferred upon justices of the peace by the disputed provisions of those Acts in cases where the amount in controversy exceeds P200, but is less than P600.<br\/><br\/>The general rule is that where part of a statute is void, as repugnant to the Organic Law, while another part is valid, the valid portion, if separable from the invalid, may stand and be enforced.\u00a0 But in order to do this, the valid portion must be so far independent of the invalid portion that it is fair to presume that the Legislature would have enacted it by itself if they had supposed that they could not constitutionally enact the\u00a0 other.\u00a0\u00a0 (Mutual Loan Co. <i>vs<\/i>.

Cognevich,\u00a0 124 La., 414; 50\u00a0 Sou., 439.)\u00a0 The language used in the invalid part of a statute can have no legal force or epcacy for any purpose whatever, and what remains must express the legislative will independently of the void part, since the court has no power to legislate.\u00a0 (State <i>vs<\/i>. Junkin, 85\u00a0 Neb.\/l; 122\u00a0 N. W., 473; 23 L. R. A., N. S., 839.)<br\/><br\/>Courts of justices of the peace are courts of limited and <i>inferior<\/i> jurisdiction.\u00a0 They are the most inferior courts in our judicial system.\u00a0 Where they have jurisdiction at all, it has never been limited by the insignificance of the particular case.\u00a0 On the contrary, the province of those courts, is well known, is to handle precisely such cases.\u00a0 If litigation be divided into important and unimportant cases, then assuredly, to justices of the peace fall only the unimportant And when the division of jurisdiction in a particular class of cases is based upon the amount in controversy, as is the case with the provisions of Acts Nos. 2041 and 2131 in question, a law providing that because of\u00a0 the inferior amount in controversy a case should go to the Court of First Instance, while another case of the same nature, because of its greater amount, could be tried before a justice of the peace, would be an anomaly and at war with the only logical distribution of jurisdiction.\u00a0 In other words, the case of A <i>vs<\/i>. B is too small and inconsequential to be tried before a justice of the peace, and must be tried in the Court of First Instance; while the case of C <i>vs<\/i>. B, being of a larger amount, may be tried by a justice of the peace.\u00a0 Such reasoning has never heretofore been used by the Legislature in distributing jurisdiction over litigation between Courts of First Instance and justice of the peace courts.\u00a0 It seems clear that the concurrent jurisdiction in cases where the amount involved is more than P200 but Jess than P600, was meant only as supplemental and ancillary to the exclusive jurisdiction over cases not exceeding P200.\u00a0 This concurrent jurisdiction must therefore be considered as inseparable from and absolutely dependent upon the exercise of that exclusive jurisdiction which has already been declared void.\u00a0 The concurrent jurisdiction must therefore be declared void also.<br\/><br\/>Other\u00a0 additional jurisdiction granted to justices of the peace by Acts Nos. 2041 and 2131 is not before the court.\u00a0 We need only say that such other additional jurisdiction bears no relation whatever to those void provisions of the statutes which provide for jurisdiction in real-estate actions; and applying the same rules to the rest of the Act which we have applied to the clause conferring concurrent jurisdiction in real-estate actions between the amounts\u00a0 of P200 and P600, we are clearly of the opinion that the validity of the remainder of the Act is not in any case dependent upon the said void provisions.<br\/><br\/>In conclusion, it seems advisable to state that the able brief of counsel for the respondent judge is based upon the a <i>priori<\/i> assumption that original jurisdiction of Courts of First Instance in real-estate actions is, by the Organic Law, made exclusive.\u00a0 We have found it quite unnecessary to postulate any such theory in disposing of the case.\u00a0 Nor has it been necessary to rely upon the second point made by counsel to the effect that jurisdiction in real-estate actions has never been conferred upon justices of the peace in the United States or England.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the justice of the peace which it is desired to have the respondent judge in this action review is an absolute nullity.\u00a0 The respondent judge acquired jurisdiction of the cause\u00a0 only for the purpose of dismissing the appeal, and in further directing the justice of the peace to proceed with the execution\u00a0 of the void judgment, the respondent judge was in error.<br\/><br\/>The preliminary injunction granted by this court, staying the execution of the judgment, will be made permanent, and the writ of mandamus grayed for must be denied.\u00a0 The petitioner will pay the costs of the cause.\u00a0 This opinion will be substituted for the one handed down by this court in the same case at the close of the last term.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

GABRIEL FUSTER, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT..<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>JOHNSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">On the 7th of February, 1875, Gabriel Fuster and Conatanza Yanez were joined in a Catholic or canonical marriage in the city of Malaga, Spain. In February of 1892, Gabriel Fuster came to the Philippine Islands, settled, and acquired real and personal property. Toward the middle of 1896, Constanza Yanez came to Manila, where her husband was residing, and here lived with him in conjugal relations until the month of April, 1899. On the 4th day of that month and year they made an agreement, in a public document, by which they \"resolved to separate and live apart, both consenting to such separation, and by virtue thereof the husband authorized the wife to <i>move<\/i> to Spain there to reside in such place as the said lady pleases.\" (B. of E., p. 13.) In the same document, the husband under took to send his wife the sum of 300 pesetas monthly for her support, payable in Madrid, Spain, from the month of June of the said year 1899. The husband complied with this obligation until August, 1899, after which time he ceased to make further payments.<br\/><br\/>In the beginning of March, 1909, the wife returned to the Philippines, but the husband had absented himself therefrom in the early days of February of the same year. On the 11th of March, 1909, the wife commenced divorce proceedings against her husband, alleging as cause of action the adultery committed by him in or about the year 1899 with a certain woman that she named in the complaint and with whom he had lived and cohabited and by whom he had had two children. She prayed that she be granted a decree of divorce; that the court order the separation of the properties of the plaintiff and the defendant, to date from the date of the said decree; that the conjugal society be therefore liquidated, and after the amount of the conjugal property had been determined, that one-half thereof be adjudicated to her; furthermore, as to the amount of pension owing for her support but not paid to her, that the defendant be ordered to pay her the sum of 36,000 Spanish pesetas, that is, 7,220 Spanish dollars, which, reduced to Philippine currency at the rate of exchange on the date of the complaint, amounted to P12,959.90. <br\/><br\/>The defendant denied that either he or his wife was a resident of the city of Manila, as they had their domicile in Barcelona, Spain, and he alleged that both of them were natives and subjects of Spain. He admitted that he was married to Constanza Yanez; he also admitted having executed the document of the 4th of April, 1899, in which the had undertaken to make an allowance for the support of his wife in Madrid, but he denied the other paragraphs of the complaint. As a special defense with regard to the allowance, he alleged: \"That in or about the month of May, 1900, he wrote to his wife, the plaintiff, instructing her to return to Manila, with a view of joining her husband and being maintained by him in his own house; that the communication was ignored by the plaintiff, who, against the will of the defendant, continued to live separately from him; that from the year 1901, the defendant did not know her address; that since 1900, the plaintiff has lived in comfort and has known where her husband resided; that the plaintiff, during all of the time referred to, in addition to disposing of valuable property belonging to her husband, possessed and still possesses property of her own, acquired by her, in greater amount than that owned by her husband; and that in any case the action has prescribed by operation of law.\" (B. of E., pp. 7 and 8.) As to the divorce, he admits that he had by the plaintiff two children that have died. He expressly denied the contents of paragraph 5 of the complaint, relating to the charge of adultery and also those of paragraphs 6, 7, and 8, concerning the possession of real and personal property of the conjugal partnership, the statement of their amount, and their qualification as being all conjugal property. As a special defense, he alleged that prior to the year 1899 he conferred powers of attorney upon the plaintiff to administer and collect property and credits pertaining to him 'to the value of about 200,000 pesos; that the plaintiff accepted and exercised the said power of attorney, attached the property and collected the credits without ever having rendered any account of them. As a special preferred defense, he alleged that neither the trial court nor any other court in the Philippine Islands had jurisdiction over the subject matter of the complaint, because, as to the allowance for support, since neither the plaintiff nor the defendant are residents of Manila, or of any other place in the Philippine Islands, the agreement upon the subject was neither celebrated, nor was it to be fulfilled, in the Philippine Islands; and as to the divorce, because the action therefor ought to be tried by the ecclesiastical courts. In conclusion, he prayed that the court find: That the court was without jurisdiction over the two causes of action; that even if it had jurisdiction, it could not order the payment of the sum claimed as arrears of alimony; that, after all, the action with regard to this cause of action has prescribed; and as to the prayer for a decree of divorce, the defendant should be acquitted, while on the other hand the plaintiff should be required to render to the defendant an accounting, supported by proofs, of her operations as his attorney and administratrix of his property in Spain.<br\/><br\/>In deciding the case, the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila held itself to have jurisdiction, decreed the suspension of life in common between the plaintiff and defendant, ordered the latter to pay the former P5.010.17, directed that the communal property be divided between the parties, with costs against the defendant, and in event that the parties could not agree to the division, it was to be effected by commissioners according to law.<br\/><br\/>Both parties appealed from this judgment, but notwith-standing the appeal, the partition of the property, by means of commissioners, was proceeded with. These latter, after various vicissitudes, rendered their report and account of the partition to the court, who then rendered final judgment, from which, also, both parties appealed.<br\/><br\/><center>I. DEFENDANT'S APPEAL.<\/center><br\/>The first error assigned is the utter lack of jurisdiction of the trial court and of all other courts of the Islands to try the case, either with regard to the fulfillment of the contract to furnish alimony, or to decree a divorce or suspension of life in common between the spouses: lack of jurisdiction over the persons and over the subject matter of the litigation; and over the persons of the contending parties, because neither of the spouses was a resident of the Philippines on the date of the complaint. <br\/><br\/>The lower court did not commit this error attributed to him. The defendant had not proved that he had elsewhere a legal domicile other than that which he manifestly had in the Philippines during the seventeen years preceding the date of the complaint. On the contrary, it plainly appears, without proof to the contrary, that during this not inconsiderable period, extending from the year 1892 until a month prior to the arrival of his wife in the Philippines in March, 1909, he had constantly resided in the said Islands, had kept open house, and had acquired in the city of Manila quite a little real property which is now the object of the division of the conjugal society. It is also plainly shown, without proof to the contrary, that his wife resided in this city of Manila from the middle of 1896 until April, 1899,\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0at which time she was permitted by him to change her residence.\u00a0\u00a0 It is affirmed by the defendant in point five of his answer to the complaint, that in May, 1900, he sent a letter instructing the plaintiff to return to Manila to live with her husband and to be supported by him in his. house, but that the plaintiff, against the will of the defendant, continued to live apart from him.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (B. of E., p. 7.) It is also affirmed in the said answer, that during all of the time referred to in the complaint, and especially since, 1900,\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0the plaintiff knew where her husband resided.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (B. of E., p. 7.)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is also very evident that the contract, by virtue of which he authorized his wife to move to Spain and reside there in such place as was agreeable to her, was executed in these Islands, \"in the city of Manila on the 4th of April, 1889,\" as is to be seen in the heading of the document.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (B. of E., p. 12.)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, at page 11 of his brief, he says that the record shows him to be a Spanish subject, inscribed in the consulate of his nation, and cites article 26 of the Civil Code, the Treaty of Paris and the Philippine Bill.<br\/><br\/>Granting these facts, there can be no doubt that the defendant, although a Spanish subject, was a resident of these Islands. Article 26 of the Civil Code that he cites itself provides that \"Spaniards who change their domicile to a foreign country, where they may be considered as natives without other conditions than that of residents therein, shall be required, in order to preserve the Spanish nationality, to state that such is their wish before the Spanish diplomatic or consular agent, who must record them in the registry of Spanish residents, as well as their spouses, should they be married, and any children they may have.\" From this provision, which is the exclusive and irrefutable law governing the defendant, we are to conclude that the domicile of the defendant and the plaintiff is fully proven, irrespective of the Treaty of Paris. With\u00acout this supposition of having acquired his domicile and residence in these Islands, he could not have required his wife to return to live with him therein because this requirement could only be based on article 58 of the Civil Code of Spain, according to which the wife is obliged to follow her husband wherever he wishes to establish his residence, or on article 48 of chapter 5 of the Marriage Law in force in the Philippines, which imposes upon the wife the duty of obeying her husband, living in his company, or of following him to wherever he transfers his domicile or residence. And just because he was absent for a month before his wife returned to the Philippines, he cannot be understood to have surrendered his habitual domicile of more than seventeen years, without having established any other afterwards, and without making any declaration in legal form, before he absented himself, of it being his intention to change his domicile, while at the same time he retains here his house, real property and all manner of means of subsistence. Section 377 of the Code of Civil Procedure leaves to the election of the plaintiff the bringing of a personal action like the one at bar either in the place where the defendant may reside or be found, or in that where the plaintiff<i> resides.<\/i><br\/><br\/>The litigating spouses have gained not only domicile (domicilio) but also residence (vecindad) in Manila. In this litigation the defendant claims that, born as he says Jin Mallorca, in the Balearic Islands, he is not subject, in his marriage, to the rules governing conjugal property, that are in force in the territories of Spain that are governed by the common law of Castile (as the Philippines in their day), because they are opposed to the Foral Law in force in the said Islands and which is respected by the Civil Code. Even if this defense could be sustained herein, paragraph 2 of article 15 of the said Civil Code would be applicable. It provides: \"For the purposes of this article, residence (<i>vecindad<\/i>) will be acquired: By residence of ten years in <i>common<\/i> law provinces or territories, unless before the termination of that time he manifests his will to the contrary; or by a residence of two years, if the interested person declares this to be his will * * * In any case, the wife will follow the condition of her husband * * *.\" On no occasion had the defendant manifested his will to the contrary, not even as he was leaving, after a residence of seventeen years, a month before the return of his wife to these Islands. On the contrary, when he inscribed himself in the Spanish consulate, he declared his intention of continuing to reside in the Islands as a Spaniard and not as a <i>Mallorquin<\/i>, subject as such to the common law of Spain.<br\/><br\/>In an endeavor to demonstrate the lack of jurisdiction of the courts of these Islands over the subject matter of the complaint, that is, to try an action for divorce between two Catholic Spaniards, he alleges in his appeal: That both litigants are Spanish subjects and that they contracted a Catholic marriage; that in accordance with article 9 of the Civil Code of Spain (the same as that of these Islands) the laws relating to family rights and duties, or to the status, condition and legal capacity of persons, govern Spaniards although they reside in a foreign country; that, in consequence, \"all questions of a civil nature, such as those dealing with the validity or nullity of the matrimonial bond, the domicile of the husband and wife, their support, as between them, the separation of their properties, the rules governing property, marital authority, division of conjugal property, the classification of their property, legal causes for divorce, the extent of the latter, the AUTHORITY to decree it, and, in general, the civil effects of marriage and divorce upon the persons and properties of the spouses, are questions that are governed exclusively by the national law of the husband and wife, and, in our case, by the Spanish law by virtue of article 9 as above set out.\" (Brief, p. 12.) The appellant and defendant continues his argument, saying: That by the express provision of article 80 of the Civil Code of Spain, \"jurisdiction in actions for divorce and nullification of canonical marriages lies with ecclesiastical courts,\" while that of civil tribunals is limited to civil marriages; that this being so, the action for divorce brought by the plaintiff in this cause does not fall within the jurisdiction of the civil courts, according to his own law of persons, because these courts ought to apply the Spanish law in accordance with the said article 9 of the Civil Code of Spain, and this Spanish law grants the jurisdiction over the present cause to the ecclesiastical courts, in the place of which no tribunal of these Islands con subrogate itself. Says this appellant: \"If a law of a foreign country were of rigorous application in a given case, a North American tribunal would have no jurisdiction to apply it in a case where the said law conferred jurisdiction upon an ecclesiastical court and therefore the North American tribunal in applying it would have to exercise a faculty which that law reserved to the ecclesiastical court.\" (Brief, pp. 13, 14, and 15.)<br\/><br\/>Unless we take the question itself for granted, the foregoing reasoning cannot be upheld. The question is precisely whether the courts of the Philippines are competent or have jurisdiction to decree the divorce now on appeal, and it is taken for granted that the power to decree it is one of the rights included in the personal statute, but appellant does not prove by any law or legal doctrine whatever that the personal statute of a foreigner carries with it, to wherever he transfers his domicile, the authority established by the law of his nation to decree his divorce, which was what he had to demonstrate.<br\/><br\/>The authority of jurisdictional power of courts to decree a divorce is not comprised within the personal status of the husband and wife, simply because the whole theory of the statutes and of the rights which belong to everyone does not go beyond the sphere of private law, and the authority and jurisdiction of the courts are not a matter of the private law of persons, but of the public or political law of the nation. \"The jurisdiction of courts and other questions relating to procedure are considered to be of a public nature and consequently are generally submitted to the territorial principle * * *. All persons that have to demand justice in a case in which foreigners intervene, a law of their nation which gives jurisdiction in such a case to territorial courts, or to a certain court within or without the territory of their nation.<br\/><br\/>It is a question that has already been settled in two decisions of the Supreme Court (Benedicto <i>vs.<\/i> De la Rama, 3 Phil. Rep., 34, and Ibanez<i> vs.<\/i> Ortiz, 5 Phil. Rep., 325).<br\/><br\/>In the present action for divorce the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila did not lack jurisdiction over the persons of the litigants, for, although Spanish Catholic subjects, they were residents of this city and had their domicile herein.<br\/><br\/>The Courts of First Instance of the Philippine Islands have the power and jurisdiction to try actions for divorce. That of the city of Manila did not lack jurisdiction by reason of the subject matter of the litigation.<br\/><br\/>The second assignment of error is directed against the finding of the court that the defendant had committed adultery with a certain woman in this city from the year 1899 until 1909; the third was against the finding that the adultery was accompanied by public scandal and injured the dignity of his wife; and the fourth for having decreed the divorce, suspension of the married life, and the separation of the properties of the parties.<br\/><br\/>The evidence relating to the foregoing not being sent up on appeal, we are unable to review it, so we accept the findings of the trial court.<br\/><br\/>There is a point of law regarding the claim that the adultery, even though it were proven, would not be a cause for divorce, because no public scandal resulted therefrom nor was there contempt displayed for the wife. (Appellant's brief, p. 26.) The facts must be accepted by this tribunal as they were found by the trial court, since the evidence cannot be reviewed; moreover, the appellee affirms the contrary and maintains that it is a proven fact, public and notorious, an assertion that the trial court must have found to be proven. (Appellee's brief, p. 5.) In law, it is not necessary that adultery, to be a cause for divorce, should\u00a0 be\u00a0 accompanied by public\u00a0 scandal\u00a0 and\u00a0 contempt for the wife. There is no law that requires this. Law 2, title 9, of the Fourth Partida does not require it.<br\/><br\/>The fifth and sixth assignments of error are directed against the finding of the trial court that there exists conjugal property, a finding that the appellant maintains is without foundation, and that which holds that the property in the hands of the receiver (that sought to be divided) is conjugal property, a conclusion which the appellant claims to be contrary to the law which should be applied to the case and according to which, as alleged in the tenth assignment of error, the whole of the property should be adjudicated to the defendant as being exclusively his.<br\/>Facts: The appellant affirms that he is a native of Mallorca in the Balearic Islands and that that is also the condition of his wife, the plaintiff. Law: That although the rule of the Civil Code is that which legally governs conjugal property, yet at the same time it admits, as an exception, the laws, usages, and customs of the Foral Law, according to which, as applied in the Balearic Islands, the law of the family is that of the division of property and that of conjugal property is not known; so that the property pertains exclusively to the spouse who, by whatever title, has acquired it. In support of the facts, appellant cites pages 27 to 37 and 39 to 41 in the bill of exceptions; and of the law, the doctrinal authority of Manresa, Gutierrez, and Alcubilla.<br\/><br\/>The citation from pages 39 to 41 of the bill of exceptions, the only pertinent one, is but an affidavit filed by the defendant in which, under oath, he himself testifies as to the Foral Law in the Balearic Islands. The adverse party says with regard to this: \"This affidavit was never presented in proof, was never received by the trial judge, and cannot seriously be considered as an effort to establish the law of a foreign jurisdiction. Sections 300, 301 and 302 of the Code of Civil Procedure, now in force in these Islands, indicate the method by which the law of a foreign country may be proved. We maintain that the affidavit of a person not versed in the law, which was never submitted as proof, never received by the trial court, and which has never been subjected to any cross-examination, is not a means of proving a foreign law on which the defendant relies.\" (Brief, pp. 6 and 7.)\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<br\/><br\/>Furthermore, on the supposition that the defendant could invoke the Foral Law as the law of his personal status in the matter of the regimen of his marriage, and that to allege this he be considered as authorized by article 15 of the Civil Code, we have said before, in dealing with his law of domicile, that paragraph 2 of this article 15 of the Civil Code would be entirely adverse to his claim, and if it be advanced that there is a similar Foral Law in the Philippines by virtue of paragraph 1 of the said article 15, it might be said, though there is not at present any need to say it, that it is not in force. The two findings attacked are in perfect accord with the law. All the property of the marriage, says article 1407 of the Civil Code, shall fee considered as conjugal property until it is proven that it belongs exclusively to the husband or to the wife. No proof has been submitted to this effect.<br\/><br\/>As seventh assignment of error it is alleged that the court below erred in holding in the judgment that the plaintiff had brought to the marriage a dowry of 30,000 Spanish dollars. But the defendant himself adds that the court made no order or decree regarding the alleged dowry. On the other hand, the plaintiff, in her fourth assignment of errors, claimed that the court erred in not confirming the report of the commissioners which gave to the said plaintiff the sum of 30,000 Spanish dollars. It is unnecessary to say anything further.<br\/><br\/>The eighth error consists in that the court below ordered the defendant to pay to the plaintiff P5,010.17 Philippine currency, whereas the plaintiff had made no demand in her complaint with respect to this sum; that no arrears of payment are owing for alimony, even though payments had been stipulated in the contract, unless they are claimed by the person who had furnished the actual support, and that alimony is due only when it is necessary; so that.<br\/><br\/>as the plaintiff has had no need of it for ten years, nor has she stated who has furnished it, there is no reason for awarding her the amount of the arrears for all that time; that as she has allowed ten years to elapse before claiming it, her action prescribed in 1904, that is to say, after five years.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff acknowledges that there is no petition or prayer in her complaint as to this cause of action, but she considers that in equity such an omission can be supplied.<br\/><br\/>Paragraph 3 of section 89 (90) of the Code of Civil Procedure determines one of the requisites of the complaint: \"A demand for the relief which the plaintiff claims.\" The section goes on to say: \"If the recovery of money or damages is demanded, the amount demanded must be stated. If special relief, such as an order for the special restitution of property, etc., the ground of demanding such relief must be stated and the special relief prayed for. But there may be added to the statement of the specific relief demanded a general prayer for such further or other relief as shall be deemed equitable.\"<br\/><br\/>In the complaint of the case at bar the provisions of paragraph 2 of the said section 89 [90] are complied with by setting forth in its paragraphs 4 and 5 the relation of the cause of action, that is, the contract of the 4th of April, 1899, by which the defendant obligated himself to send to the plaintiff in Spain a certain amount of money monthly, for her support, and the failure to comply with this obligation after the month of August, 1899. Paragraph 6, as a consequence of the promise established in 4 and 5, says as follows: \"That the defendant Gabriel Fuster y Fuster actually owes the plaintiff the sum of 36,100 Spanish pesetas, that is, 7,220 dollars, which, reduced at the present rate of exchange, amounts to the sum of P12,959.90, Philippine currency.\" (B. of E., p. 2.) In the case of default on the part of the defendant \"the court shall proceed to hear the plaintiff and his witnesses and assess the damages or determine the other relief to which the plaintiff <i>may\u00a0 be entitled,<\/i> including the costs of the action, and render final judgment for the plaintiff to recover such sum or to receive such other relief as the pleadings and the facts warrant.\" The pleadings, not the prayer of the complaint.<br\/><br\/>This court has recently decided that the pleadings, not the prayer, exactly, are the essential part of a complaint.<br\/><br\/>It is not a question of alimony for the present, nor for the future, which constitutes the first cause of action, but of certain sums stipulated in a contract. This contract is a law for the contracting parties, a law which rises superior to those general laws which regulate the nature of the subject matter of the contract (in the present case an entirely voluntary one) and which govern judicial action.<br\/><br\/>An action arising out of a contract of this nature does not prescribe like all personal ones, but, by the provisions of article 1964 of the Civil Code, after fifteen years. But even though the provisions of article 1966 were applicable, by which an action to compel the fulfillment of an agreement to pay alimony prescribes in five years, yet by section 50 of the Code of Civil Procedure, \"when payment has been made upon any demand founded upon contract * * * an action may be brought * * * after such payment * * *.\" And the parties admit that on the 18th of August, 1908, the plaintiff secured the payment of 6,365.68 pesetas by virtue of the contract of April 4, 1899. So that from August, 1908, until March, 1909, the date of the complaint, the said period of five years had not elapsed.<br\/><br\/>The ninth assignment of error consists in that the court below erred in empowering the receiver to proceed to the separation of the property and in appointing commissioners to make the partition and distribution between the spouses, since the principal question in this action hinges upon the classification of the property; that it was erroneously classified as conjugal property, whereas all of it pertained to the husband alone and should be adjudicated to him for the reason that, as it reiterated in the tenth assignment of error, the conjugal partnership was not subject to the provisions of the law governing conjugal property, because such provision are totally foreign to the Foral Law of the Balearic Islands.<br\/><br\/>The action of the trial court, by the terms of section 184 of the Code of Civil Procedure, was in accordance with law. The only question before this court is the partition of real property. All that referred to in the second decision appealed from, dated September 9, 1911, is urban real estate. Its classification as conjugal property is in accordance with law, as is shown in the foregoing reasoning, and that no consideration of the Foral Law enters into the question has also been demonstrated.<br\/><br\/><center>II.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PLAINTIFF'S APPEAL. <\/center><br\/>As the trial court rendered judgment ordering the defendant to pay to the plaintiff only 5,010.17, the petitioner here prays that the judgment be reversed and that in its place this court order the defendant to pay to the plaintiff her claim of P12,959.90, plus the additional sum which the alimony amounts to at the rate of P107.70 per month, dating from the 1st of August, 1909, until the date of payment, with legal interest upon the said P12,959.90 from the date of the filing of the complaint until the date of payment, and, furthermore, legal interest upon each of the monthly payments due after the filing of the complaint, and which will continue to become due until the close of this litigation.<br\/><br\/>The trial court made the following findings: First, that the total amount of the alimony owing to the plaintiff amounted to 34,200 pesetas; second, that of this sum the plaintiff had collected in Madrid 6,365.68; third, that the remainder, that is, 27,834.32, was equivalent to $5,566.86 Mexican currency; fourth, that the Mexican peso was worth 90 centavos Philippine currency; fifth, that therefore the sum of $5,566.86 Mexican currency was equivalent to P5,010 Philippine currency; and finally, as there was no evidence as to the kind of pesetas agreed upon, it was to be presumed that it was that current at the time and place where the agreement was made, which was Mexican <i>pesetas.<\/i><br\/><br\/>In her appeal, the plaintiff contends that these findings are erroneous in that, firstly, the parties had admitted that the<i> pesetas<\/i> referred to in the contract of the 4th of April, 1899, were Spanish, and in view of this admission the court was not empowered to define them as being different from the kind admitted by the parties; secondly, if he were so empowered, his interpretation should be governed by the terms of the law.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the first error, the plaintiff says that the statement is made in her complaint that the defendant had obligated himself to pay her a \"monthly pension for her support of 300 Spanish pesetas, that is, 60 Spanish dollars, which, reduced to Philippine currency, amounts to P107.70;\" that the defendant had admitted this in his answer to the complaint, and that by his finding in a sense other than that accepted and not refuted in the answer of the defendant, the court violated the provisions of section 94 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br\/><br\/>The court has not incurred this error, because it does not appear that the defendant in his answer accepted the fact in the manner alleged in the complaint. The defendant said that he admitted having made the agreement referred to in paragraph 4 of the complaint, and that he stood upon its contents. The contents of the document to which he refers is of the following tenor: \"Mr. Fuster binds and obligates himself to pay to his said wife the sum of 300 pesetas, monthly, payable <i>de sucuenta<\/i> in the city and capital of Madrid, for her support * * *.\" He did not therefore admit the matter of the <i>Spanish pesetas;<\/i> that does not appear in the contents of the document\u2014the only thing he admitted in his answer.<br\/><br\/>As to the second error, the court did not commit it in applying the rule contained in article 1287 of the Civil Code. \"The usages or customs of the country shall be taken into consideration in interpreting ambiguity in contracts * * *.\" If in the contract the word \"pesetas,\" not being specific, was ambiguous, then it was in harmony with this precept to interpret it as being the peseta then in use or current when and where the agreement was made, Mexican being then the usual and current money in the Philippines. Furthermore, the phrase <i>de sucuenta<\/i> clearly means that it was not \"Spanish <i>pesetas<\/i>\" that the contracting parties had in mind, because if the agreement had been a specific one to pay 300 Spanish pesetas in Madrid, everyone would of course understand that the expense of following the fluctuations of change and of the differences in value between the money current in the country, and the Spanish <i>pesetas,<\/i> would have to be defrayed by the obligated party; whereas, if nothing more than pesetas was mentioned, it was necessary to decide which party should pay for the difference in value so that the 300 pesetas stipulated here should be 300 Spanish pesetas paid in Madrid. Against the reasons of the court below for his decision this court can offer no legal grounds. The rule of interpretation cited is the one applicable and it supports the reasoning of the decision appealed from.<br\/><br\/>The appellant also alleges as error that the court did not adjudicate to her the 30,000 Spanish dollars which the commissioners proposed in their report. First she characterizes this sum of 30,000 dollars as the dowry of the wife delivered to the husband, then, later, as paraphernal property brought to the marriage.<br\/><br\/>According to the last instructions of the court to the commissioners, this amount of 30,000 dollars could not enter into the partition, and with reason. If, as was claimed, it was inherited by the plaintiff from her uncle, it really constitutes paraphernal property under article 1381. \"Paraphernal property is that which the wife brings to the marriage without being included in the dowry and that she may acquire after the creation of the same without being added thereto.\" But it is a provision of article 1384 that \"The wife shall have the management of the paraphernal property unless she has delivered the same to her husband, before a notary, in order that he may administer said property.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In such case the husband is obliged to create a mortgage for the value of the personal property he may receive, or to secure said property, in the manner established for the dowry property.\" Not even was there offered in evidence the public deed of delivery, nor the equally public mortgage deed that is required by law. So that, therefore, the necessary proof of the obligation to return paraphernal property as here demanded does not exist.<br\/><br\/>The partition of property decreed in the judgment appealed from of the 9th of September, 1911, should be and is hereby confirmed.<br\/><br\/>The two judgments appealed from are hereby affirmed, without special pronouncement of costs in this instance.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Mateo, is a priest of the Roman Catholic Church and was stationed in the town of Aliaga in the Province of Nueva Ecija during the month of November, 1911, and had been for some months prior thereto.\u00a0 On the 27th day of October, 1911, he was called on in the performance of his duties to execute an affidavit.\u00a0 Being asked to produce his personal cedula for the current year, a necessary prerequisite under the law for a legal and valid affidavit, he, in ignorance, presented one not only for 1911, but also for 1910.\u00a0 Upon examination of the cedula for the latter year it was observed by the justice that the age therein had been changed, the figures \"23\" having been changed to \"25.\"\u00a0 A complaint was filed charging the accused with falsification of the cedula for 1910, in violation of section 55 of Act No. 1189.<br\/><br\/>The testimony of the prosecution tends to show that the accused went to the office of the municipal treasurer to cash a check.\u00a0 The check not having been indorsed by a person known to the municipal treasurer, the latter refused to cash it until the accused made an affidavit that the check belonged to him and that he was entitled to the sum named therein.\u00a0 Thereupon the accused went to the justice of the peace of the village to execute the affidavit thus required.\u00a0 The justice, as a prerequisite to administering the oath, asked the affiant to exhibit his cedula for the current year.\u00a0 The accused, being ignorant of what the law required, produced <i>two<\/i> cedulas, one for 1910 and one for 1911.\u00a0 On examination of the cedula for the year 1910 the change in the age of the accused was, as we have said, observed by the justice, who thereupon went to the office of the municipal treasurer to examine the stubs from which cedulas had been torn.\u00a0 A comparison of the cedulas with the stubs confirmed his observation that the age in said cedulas had been changed as already detailed.<br\/><br\/>The defense asserts, and the defendant testified, that, prior to going to the justice of the peace to make the affidavit referred to, he had never examined or even read the cedulas, or any other cedulas for that matter, and was, for that reason, ignorant of their contents; that\u00a0 he had never had occasion to use a cedula before, and, deeming that his duty was fully performed when he purchased those mentioned, he had laid them away\u00a0 without examination and without thought.\u00a0 Being asked to produce the cedula for 1911, he went home and got not only the cedula for 1911 but also that for 1910.\u00a0 The fact that he had been called upon to present a cedula aroused his curiosity as to the contents of those in his possession and he read them.\u00a0 To his surprise he found that the ages stated therein were incorrect.\u00a0 Being young\u2014he having been out of college little more than a year\u2014and ignorant of the law relating to documents of that kind, he was seized with fear as to the consequences which might follow if he exhibited to a public officer cedulas in which his age was stated incorrectly.\u00a0 He, therefore, went to the municipal treasurer, from whom he had obtained them, for the purpose of having them corrected before presenting them to the justice.\u00a0 He asserts that, on showing them to the municipal treasurer, he frankly stated to him that he himself had changed them in order to make them correspond with his actual age, and asked him for his aid in correcting them, and that that official then and there consented to and confirmed the change.\u00a0 He declares, further, that he had no intention of committing any wrong; that he in no sense intended to defraud or prejudice the municipality or the Government by his act; that he obtained no profit or benefit therefrom of any kind, and that he did not know that what he had done was illegal or unlawful.<br\/><br\/>It appears from the evidence of the defense, which seems to be uncontradicted, that there was a good deal of friction between the\u00a0 accused and the municipal officers who presented the complaint against him and upon whose testimony he was convicted.\u00a0 Several suits of one kind or another had been instituted against him by these officials or through their efforts or influence.\u00a0 In fact, the complaint against the accused seems to have been the immediate result of an angry reply made by him to a question put by the municipal treasurer.\u00a0 The latter in his testimony says:<br\/><blockquote>\"I asked him who had changed the number in the cedula and he answered me in a threatening voice that I had nothing whatever to do with that because he said that he had purchased the cedula and could do what he liked with it.\u00a0 Upon seeing this, I went at once to the court for the purpose of denouncing him for the falsification of a document.<\/blockquote>It is the claim put forward by the prosecution that a loss to the Government is not necessary to maintain the action;\u00a0 that no criminal intent is required; that gain or purpose of gain on the part of the accused is not necessary to violate the Act.\u00a0 It is maintained further that the Act is violated whenever a person makes any change whatever in a cedula, utterly regardless of whether the Government loses or the accused gains, or whether the intent or purpose is innocent or otherwise; that the object of the law is to preserve intact the certificates which the Government issues and to prevent them from being changed by\u00a0 any person for any purpose, whether the change be material or immaterial, whether it corrects the document or falsifies it, whether the document, after change, is capable of effecting a fraud or deception or not.<br\/><br\/>The information in this case reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"The undersigned, amending the information, accuses Alejandro R. Mateo of a violation of section 55 of the Internal Revenue Law, committed as follows:<br\/><br\/>\"On or about the month of October of the year 1911, said accused maliciously and criminally altered the age appearing in his personal cedula for the year 1910, putting the age of 25 years in place of 23, and retained in his possession such altered cedula for the purpose of using the same, thereby defrauding the internal revenues.\"<\/blockquote>Giving the information the broadest interpretation possible, it charges, first, that the accused altered the age in the 1910 cedula, and second, that he kept it in his possession with intent to use it, the phrase \"thereby defrauding the internal revenues\" being permitted to modify both clauses, namely, that which alleges the alteration of the cedula and that which alleges his retaining it in his possession with intent of future use.<br\/><br\/>While, under certain circumstances, it may not be necessary, in order to establish the charge of falsifying a cedula, to show a pecuniary loss to the Government, nevertheless, under the facts and circumstances of this case, we think we might fairly hold that\u00a0 the fraud charged, being one which relates to the revenues of the Government, and therefore to a pecuniary or financial matter, such\u00a0 loss must be shown.\u00a0 But, not to restrict too narrowly the consideration of this case, we will assume that the prosecution can be maintained without showing a financial loss to the Government.<br\/><br\/>In the discussion of this case we take it that it is undisputed that the accused stated his correct age in his testimony on the trial, and, accordingly, that the age in the altered cedula was his correct age; that, therefore, all that he did was to make the cedula speak the truth.\u00a0 It is also uncontradicted that he voluntarily stated to the officials to whom he presented the cedula that he had changed it and that he did so for the purpose of making it state his correct age; that he\u00a0 made no effort to conceal what he had done; that he maintained at the time that he had no intention to injure or defraud, and that he made the change in the interest of truth; that he set forth fully the reasons which moved him to make the change, all of which were, upon their face, innocent.<br\/><br\/>The foundation of judgment of conviction, given by the court, is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"From the evidence presented the court finds that on the 11th of January, 1910, the\u00a0 municipal treasurer of the municipality of Baliuag, Province of Bulacan, issued in favor of the defendant, Alejandro R. Mateo, personal cedula No. F-1208348 upon receiving the sum of P2; that in order to obtain said personal cedula the accused presented to the municipal treasurer his personal cedula for the year 1909 in which cedula the age appeared to be 22, and for which reason said municipal treasurer put in the said cedula the age of 23 years; that in the month of October, 1911, in the municipality of Aliaga the accused changed the age in said cedula, scratching out the figure 3 in the age 23 and putting in the place thereof the figure 5, making his age appear 25 instead of 23; that after having altered the cedula in the manner stated the accused presented said cedula to the justice of the peace of Aliaga and to the municipal treasurer of said municipality\u00a0 for the purpose of swearing to an affidavit relating to the cashing of a check; that by reason of said change the accused defrauded the internal revenues of the sum of P4, or more, in the sense that, according to the law, he should have begun payment of his personal cedula tax in the eighteenth year of his age, and, if it is true that he was 25 years of age in the year 1910 as he declared in this case, he ought to have paid the cedula tax for eight years, when, in reality, he had paid it\u00a0 for only six; that if the father of the accused had made a mistake as to the time when he ought to have begun to purchase the personal cedula for the accused, as the accused himself declares, this mistake ought to have been corrected and he should have settled the matter with the municipal treasurer by the payment to him of the tax corresponding to the two years, together with the corresponding fine; that having altered the cedula in the month of October, 1911, the accused presented said cedula to the justice of the peace of Aliaga and to the municipal treasurer of said municipality.\"<\/blockquote>From this quotation it is clear that the court inferred that the Government had been defrauded of F4.\u00a0 The basis of that\u00a0 inference is that, according to the admitted age of the defendant at the time the cedula was changed, he should have paid the tax for eight\u00a0 years, whereas he had actually paid it for only six.\u00a0 It seems to us that there is substantially no evidence in the case from which the inference can properly be drawn that the accused had paid the tax for only six years.\u00a0 There is no direct proof to that effect.\u00a0 He himself declared positively, more than once, that he, or his father, began\u00a0 paying the cedula tax when he was 18 years of age and that it had been paid every year from that time forward.\u00a0 The Government seeks to overcome that evidence by inferences from the fact that the cedula was changed and that the age stated therein before the change was incorrect\u2014in other words, that there had been, somewhere and sometime, a misrepresentation by the accused as to his age.\u00a0 There was no reason why the Government should have left that fact to inference, if it was a material fact.\u00a0 If the defendant had not paid his tax consistently from the time he was 18 years of age, it could easily have been proved by the production of the cedula stubs showing when the defendant began to pay, the age that appeared in the first cedula, and all the cedulas for that matter, and the number of years that he had actually paid.\u00a0 With evidence, clear and indisputable, easily at hand and capable of being presented, the Government, in a criminal case, ought not to leave to inference a fact which it seems to regard as so material.\u00a0 Under all the facts and circumstances of this case, and particularly in view of the failure of the Government to present the evidence in its possession upon that subject, we would, if we regarded it material, accept as true, according to the weight of the evidence, the declaration of the defendant that he had paid all of the cedula taxes to which the Government was entitled.<br\/><br\/>We do not, however, in this case, give much importance to this contention, even if true.\u00a0 We must observe that the information charges\u00a0 that the defendant, by the act of changing the cedula, defrauded the Government; and that he retained said altered cedula\u00a0 in his possession with intent to use it for the perpetration of other frauds.\u00a0 The issue in the case, then, is, did the act of altering the cedula and retaining it in his possesion\u00a0 after the alteration actually defraud the Government, or could it, in any possible way, defraud the Government?\u00a0 The question is not, did the defendant misrepresent his age at some time prior to the alteration of the cedula and thereby, <i>at that time<\/i>, defraud the Government, but is, rather, did this particular\u00a0 act of alteration deprive the Government, <i>at that time<\/i>, of any part of its revenues, or could it do so <i>in future<\/i>?\u00a0 Or did that act prejudice the Government in any possible way or benefit the accused in any possible way?\u00a0 In considering this question we must note:<br\/><br\/>In the first place, the cedula, with the alteration of which the defendant stands charged, was the cedula for <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">1910<\/span>, and said cedula was altered, in the month of October, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">1911<\/span>.\u00a0 According to the\u00a0 evidence, this cedula was issued to the defendant on the 11th day of January, 1910.\u00a0 It therefore expired on the 31st day of December of the same year.\u00a0 That being so, the only cedula that had any force or effect in October, 1911, when this 1910 cedula was altered, was the cedula for the year 1911.\u00a0 The 1910 cedula was, therefore, without force or effect on the date on which this crime is alleged to have been committed.\u00a0 The cedula being thus dead in law for all effects and purposes, was it possible to defraud the revenue by any alteration as to age made in October, 1911?\u00a0 Or was it possible for the accused, by such alteration, to obtain any of the privileges or immunities defined in section 125 of the law which he could not have obtained if there had been no alteration?\u00a0 While it is clear that it might have been altered as to the year, for example, thereby defrauding the Government of the\u00a0 tax for one year, still it seems to us impossible to have defrauded the revenues by merely altering the age.\u00a0 The tax had already been paid for the year to which that cedula referred.\u00a0 That cedula, altered or unaltered as to age, could not have been used for any other year.\u00a0 Would that cedula, altered or unaltered as to age, have served the accused if he had presented it to the justice of the peace in October, 1911?\u00a0 Clearly, no.\u00a0 Only a 1911 cedula would have availed him.\u00a0 Could he have used the 1910 cedula, altered or unaltered as to age, for any purpose after the expiration of 1910?\u00a0 Clearly, no.\u00a0 No official would have accepted\u00a0 it for a moment for any purpose whatever, altered or unaltered. How, then, did the act of the defendant defraud the revenues?\u00a0 Did the Government have less money in its coffers after the act was performed than it did before?\u00a0 Would it have had more money in its Treasury if the\u00a0 act had not been performed?\u00a0 Did the act prevent it from receiving a single centavo which it would have received otherwise?\u00a0 Would the act diminish its revenues the day or the month or the year after?\u00a0 Would not the Government have been in exactly the same position if the act had never been performed?\u00a0 The fundamental fact is that the cedula, after it was changed, was incapable of being used to commit a fraud.\u00a0 It is true that, if he had placed a <i>false<\/i> age in the cedula, he might thereby, by using that as the basis for the issuance of succeeding cedulas, as a matter of record, reach the age of exemption (60 years) quicker than he really ought.\u00a0 But it is undisputed that he\u00a0 did not put a false age in the cedula, and, even if he did, the assumption that he did so to save P4 thirty-five years later is so remote that we think it negligible in this case.\u00a0 Precisely these same\u00a0 reasons show that the Government was not injured or the accused benefited in any other way by the act complained of.<br\/><br\/>The only possible theory upon which it could be urged that the defendant committed any crime at all, and\u00a0 that is neither charged nor proved, would be that, at the outset, he or his father had misrepresented his age and, instead of beginning to pay the tax when he was eighteen, he had, by misrepresentation, deferred payment until he had reached the age of twenty; that, having misrepresented his age at the outset, it was necessary to continue the misrepresentation because any change in the age would be immediately discovered by the\u00a0 official who issued the cedula, who is required to refer to the cedula, or the record, of the previous year in issuing one for the current year; that, after the lapse of\u00a0 six or eight years, when the defendant was called upon for the first time to produce his cedula for the inspection of a public official, fearing that his former misrepresentation would be discovered, he thereupon, in order to cover up his fraud, changed the cedula to make it correspond to his real age.\u00a0 But even if this theory be held to be tenable, would the act of altering the cedula be more than an attempt to hide the evidence of a crime committed long since?<br\/><br\/>In the second place, we do not think that the defendant committed any crime on changing his age.\u00a0 He simply made the cedula speak the truth.\u00a0 What harm could ensue to the Government by making the data in the cedula conform to the facts?\u00a0 It is the undisputed evidence in the case that the cedula, before it was changed, did not contain the correct age of the accused, and that the age, as changed, was the correct age.\u00a0 How can the Government be injured by changing a cedula so that the correct age may appear therein?\u00a0 When done honestly and with no evil intent and when no gain or advantage results or could possibly result therefrom, it is not forgery (and falsification is but an extension of the crime of forgery as known in America) under Spanish or American authority to make a document of this kind speak the truth.\u00a0 While such a change by one party without the consent of the other is always something to be strongly discouraged, nevertheless, it is not criminal and cannot, therefore, be made the basis of a criminal prosecution.<br\/><br\/>The crime with which the defendant in this case stands charged is generally spoken of as the <i>falsification<\/i> of a cedula.\u00a0 The very word, <i>falsification<\/i>, gives a clear insight into the nature of the crime and the act which constitutes it.\u00a0 The change made by the accused in this case was not a <i>falsification<\/i>; it was a <i>correction<\/i>.\u00a0 It did not make the document speak a lie; it made it speak the truth.\u00a0 It did not deceive; it prevented\u00a0 deception.\u00a0 Nor was it an alteration of the document in the sense\u00a0 in\u00a0 which the word is ordinarily used.\u00a0 Generally, the word <i>alteration<\/i> has inherent in it the idea of deception-of making the instrument speak something which the parties did not intend it to speak.\u00a0 To be an alteration in violation of law it must be one \"which causes it (the instrument)\u00a0 to speak a language different in legal effect from that which it originally spake.\"<br\/><br\/>In the third place, and this is but an addition to the observations just made, the instrument was not changed in any material sense.\u00a0 Before the crime of falsification of a cedula is complete, it is necessary that the instrument be altered in some material respect.\u00a0 If the cedula could produce no other or different effect after the change than before, no crime has been committed.\u00a0 It\u00a0 is the capacity which the instrument has for mischief after the\u00a0 change which is the essence of the crime.\u00a0 In a decision of the supreme court of Spain of the 23d of December, 1885, published in the\u00a0 Gazette on the 21st of\u00a0 June, 1886, it appeared that one of the clerks in the office of the district court, in spreading upon the record the proceedings taken for the appointment of a guardian <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">ad litem<\/span> for certain minor children and the declaration of heirship in their favor, entered such proceedings as of a date anterior to the date on which they were actually entered.\u00a0 The clerk, for this act, was charged with the falsification of a public document, was convicted of <i>imprudencia temeraria<\/i> in the Court of First Instance, and appealed to the supreme court of Spain, which tribunal in reversing the judgment said in part:<br\/><blockquote>\"Considering that even though in the falsification of public or official documents, whether by public officials or by private persons, it is unnecessary that there be present the idea of gain or the intent to injure a third person, for the reason that, in contradistinction to private documents, the principal thing punished is the violation of the public faith and the destruction of the truth as therein solemnly proclaimed, it must, nevertheless, be borne in mind that the change in the public document must be such as to affect the integrity of the same or to change the effects which it would otherwise produce; for, unless that happens, there could not exist the essential element of the intention to commit the crime which is required by article 1 of the Penal Code; considering that the fact that Don Augustin Montes Moreno set out the proceedings as of a date prior to that on which they actually occurred, and therefore incorrectly, the remaining part of the document being true,\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 neither affected the integrity or truth of said proceedings nor affected in any essential way their results or effects, it is necessary to conclude that the criminal intent mentioned in the previous\u00a0 observation was absent; considering that, even though the accused consciously attached incorrect dates to the proceedings, nevertheless that act does not take on the character of a crime, and for that reason the Audiencia de Huelva erred in convicting the accused\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.\"<\/blockquote>Viada (vol. 2, p. 435) says in reply to the question, what is to be understood by the words \"essential element\" of a cedula as used\u00a0 in article 321:<br\/><blockquote>\"We are of the opinion that, there existing no other purpose in this class of documents than that of assuring the identity of the individual and the surveillance of the administrative authorities, only those elements should be considered <i>essential<\/i> in a cedula the alteration of which has for its object the prevention of identification of the citizen or the escape of that surveillance which the administrative authorities are to exercise in the interest of the public security.\u00a0 Moreover, it was very\u00a0 proper that the authors of the Code should have limited the falsification of this class of documents to the alteration of the <i>essential<\/i> elements of the document.\u00a0 Thanks to this prudent and well understood limitation, which is not found in the Penal Code of our neighboring republic, there could not arise in this country the situation recorded in French jurisprudence, wherein it appears that a <i>cura economo<\/i>, who was journeying in company with a woman with whom he was living in concubinage, sought to hide his identity as a cleric and falsified the passport or cedula he was carrying, by substituting the\u00a0 word <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">habitant<\/span> for the word <i>desservant<\/i>.\u00a0 The trial court acquitted him of the charge of having falsified a cedula, basing its decision upon the ground that, in altering the passport or cedula, he did nothing more than yield to a legitimate sense of shame without injuring either public or private interest.\u00a0 The supreme court, however, set aside the judgment of acquittal, in spite of the reasonableness and justice of the grounds upon which it was based, holding that he was guilty of the falsification charged because article 153 of the French Code punishes every alteration of a passport <i>without distinction as to circumstances or motives<\/i>.\u00a0 Under the better wording of our article 321, our supreme court would undoubtedly have affirmed the judgment of acquittal on the ground that the alteration in question could not be regarded as <i>essential<\/i>, either for what it represented in itself or for the very evident motive that prompted it, which was to avoid a public scandal.\"<\/blockquote>We do not hold that the age contained in a cedula issued to a particular person is not an essential element of the cedula.\u00a0 If the alteration in the age is of such a character as to hide the identity of the person, or to assist in doing so, such alteration would be essential and the crime of falsification would be complete.\u00a0 In the case before us, Jiowever, the alteration in the age was not sufficient to warrant us in holding that such an alteration was material with respect to the identity of the person to whom it was issued or with regard to his ability thereby to obtain a privilege or immunity which he could not have obtained if the change had not been made.\u00a0 (Sec. 125, Act No. 1189.)<br\/><br\/>The age would also be essential, and its alteration would be an essential alteration, if the change were of such character and extent as to enable the one altering it to secure a privilege or an immunity which he would hot have enjoyed if the change had not been made.\u00a0 Such, for example, would be a change in the age so as to make one a voter when he in fact was not.\u00a0 In the case in hand, however, the alteration was not of that character.\u00a0 The change did\u00a0 not affect in the remotest degree the privileges or immunities which the accused could enjoy under the cedula.\u00a0 (Sec. 125.)<br\/><br\/>The judgment is reversed\u00a0 and the\u00a0 accused\u00a0 acquitted.\u00a0 Costs <i>de oficio<\/i>.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Antonio M. Barretto, we beg leave to offer for sale to your principal, at their actual market value, the <i>participation<\/i> of Sr. Barretto in the joint venture known as La Insular and the one-half interest of the latter in the participation therein\u00a0 which stands in the name of Messrs. Barretto &amp; Co.\u00a0 As you are doubtless aware these participations represent nominal values of P20,000 and P69,400, making a total nominal value of P54,700 which is hereby offered.\"<\/blockquote>Again,\u00a0 the plaintiff's attorneys\u00a0 after acknowledging the receipt of the balance sheet of the profits for the year ending June 30, 1909, stated in their letter to the defendant's representative, dated March 2, 1910, that, \"Now that the accord between the interested parties no longer exists we do not deem it feasible to subscribe a balance of this nature, unless\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\"<br\/><br\/>And again, the plaintiff himself, in his letter of April 7, 1910, addressed to the defendant's representative, said:\u00a0 \"In view of\u00a0 the relations that have come about between Mr. Santa Marina and myself, I believe it would suit both of us that our interest in the La Insular\u00a0 business should be separated, and that the only point to be discussed is that of the amount that should be paid me for my share.\"<br\/><br\/>From the correspondence above mentioned it appears that the plaintiff offered to sell to the defendant his participation in La Insular.\u00a0 This offer\u00a0 was made on account of the strained relations existing between the parties at that time and the desire on the part of the plaintiff to separate himself from that business.\u00a0 In the offer the plaintiff's interest or participation was definitely defined and stated to be P20,000 in the nominal capital of P865,000.\u00a0 (We are not now dealing with the plaintiff's interest in the P69,400 of Barretto &amp; Company.)<br\/><br\/>Article 1450 of the Civil Code reads: \"The sale shall be perfected between vendor and vendee and shall be binding on both of them, if they have agreed upon the thing which is the object of the contract and upon the price, even when neither has been delivered.\"<br\/><br\/>This is supplemented by article 1447 of the Code which reads as follows: \"In order that the price may be considered fixed, it shall be sufficient that it be fixed\u00a0 with regard to another determinate thing also specific, or that the determination of the same be left to the judgment of a specified person.\"<br\/><br\/>The contract of May 3, 1910, after reciting the fact that each of the contracting parties is a participant in the joint account association known as La Insular, provides that:<br\/><blockquote>\"Whereas the respective contracting parties have agreed, the one to sell and the other to buy the whole of the right, title and interest of the said Antonio Maria Barretto in and to the said joint account association, including not only the individual participation of the said party of the second part standing on the\u00a0 books of the association in the name of Antonio M. Barretto, but also one-half of the share in the business which stands on the books in the name of Barretto &amp; Company constituting a\u00a0 total nominal share of P54,700 Philippine currency in the total nominal capital of P865,000 Philippine currency; and<br\/><br\/>\"Whereas the respective contracting parties have been unable to agree as to the true present value of the said interest of the party of the second part, but have agreed upon the method of fixing and determining the said value for which the party of the first part is to buy and the party of the second part is to sell that interest;<br\/><br\/>\"Wherefore, by reason and in consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual promises and agreements herein-after set forth, the respective parties herein contracting do hereby mutually stipulate, agree, and provide the following:<br\/><br\/>\"(1) That a board of assessors, composed of Enrique Barrera y Caldes, D, M.

Barretto hereby declares to have received from John D. MacGavin as legal representative of Jose Santa Marina as the price of the cession and transfer of the said shares, the sum of P280,025.70 Philippine currency by check No. 528525 drawn by the said MacGavin in his above-stated\u00a0 capacity upon the Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank of this city, for which sum the first named issues to him a most legal bill of sale.\u00a0 <i>Antonio M. Barretto also acknowledges by virtue of the present sale, cession, and transfer that he has from this date relinquished (separado) all intervention, claim, right, or action that he has in said factory by reason of the shares under consideration.\"<\/i><br\/><br\/>Under article 1450, <i>supra<\/i>, there are two indispensable requisites in a perfected sale:\u00a0 (1) There must be an agreement upon the thing which is the object of the contract; and (2) the contracting parties must agree upon the price.\u00a0 The object of the contract in the case at bar was the whole of the plaintiff's right, title, and interest in\u00a0 La Insular.\u00a0 This whole was 4\/173 of the entire net value of the business.\u00a0 The parties agreed that the price should be 4\/173 of the total net value.\u00a0 The fixing of such net value was unreservedly left to the judgment of the appraisers.\u00a0 As to the thing and the price the minds of the contracting parties met, and all questions relating thereto were settled.\u00a0 Nothing was left unfinished in so far as the contracting parties were concerned.\u00a0 Neither\u00a0 party could withdraw from the contract without the consent of the other.\u00a0 The result is that the two essential requisites necessary to constitute a perfected sale were present.<br\/><br\/>But the plaintiff strongly insists that the language used in the contracts of May 3 and November 22 and the fact that the appraisers did not take into consideration in fixing the value of the business the profits accruing after June 30, 1909, show beyond a doubt that the first named contract constitutes an agreement to sell in the future and not a perfected sale and that this is clearly in harmony with the intention of\u00a0 the parties.<br\/><br\/>In support of the above proposition the plaintiff calls our attention to the recital in the first paragraph of the excerpt from the contract of May 3, 1910, to the effect that the parties \"have agreed, the one to sell and the other to buy\" and the words of the fifth paragraph where it is stated that \"the party of the first part (the defendant) will immediately buy for cash and the party of the second part (the plaintiff) will immediately sell\" the plaintiff's entire interest in the business; cites Alcantara <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs.<\/span> Alinea et al. (8 Phil. Rep., 112); and quotes the following from the report of the appraisers:<br\/><blockquote>\"\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 proceed to make a valuation of the property, stock, securities, and credits which compose the assets of the said business known and designated as the Insular Cigar Factory, taking\u00a0 as a basis\u00a0 therefor the assets of the said business on <i>June 30, 1909<\/i>, and in order to act with greater certainty in the discharge of their duties have had the real estate in Manila appraised by a civil engineer, Mr. Irureta Goyena, the machinery by an engineer, Mr. Loader, and the stocks of tobacco by tobacco experts recommended by\u00a0 the managers of the cigar factories called Flor de la Isabela, La Comercial, and Maria Cristina, and these experts have discharged the duties imposed upon them in the manner shown in the respective reports filed by them.\u00a0 With respect to the real estate in the Provinces of Cagayan and Isabela, and the steam launch <i>Santa Marina<\/i>, the undersigned, after hearing evidence of persons whom they deem to be competent, have fixed the valuation of those properties in a manner deemed by them to be fair and equitable.\u00a0 With regard to the 'Sundry Debtors' account, they have proceeded to make an examination of the same and have disregarded the accounts which in their judgment may be regarded as uncollectible and deducted 25 per cent from those which in their opinion are doubtful.\u00a0 In view of the difference between the value placed by the parties on the furniture and fixtures, they have taken the average of those valuations so as to avoid the expense of an expert appraisal.\u00a0 And, finally, with respect to the rest of the items which make up the assets of the said business, they have accepted the figures at which they stand in the said\u00a0 inventory as these have been accepted by both parties.\"<\/blockquote>For the purposes of determining the soundness of the plaintiff's position with reference to the intention of the parties, we will examine (1) the contract of May 3, and (2) the report of the appraisers.<br\/><br\/>1. The recitals in the first and fifth\u00a0 paragraphs relied upon by the plaintiff standing alone indicate that it was the intention of the parties to make a contract to sell in the future, but it must be remembered that the whole contract must be interpreted or read together in order to arrive at its true meaning.\u00a0 Certain stipulations cannot be segregated and then made to control, neither do particular words and phrases necessarily determine the character of the contract.\u00a0 As to whether or not the parties, when they executed the contract of May 3,\u00a0 made a perfected sale or only an agreement to sell in the future is not to be determined alone by any particular provision the said contract contains, disconnected from all others, but in the ruling intention of the parties as gathered from all the language they have used and from their contemporaneous and subsequent acts.<br\/><br\/>In the contract of May 3, we find that the parties did not only agree \"the one to sell and the other to buy\" and that \"one will immediately sell and the other will immediately buy\" the whole of the plaintiff's interest but that they were unable to agree \"as to the\u00a0 true present value of the said interest;\" they did agree, however, upon the method of fixing and determining such value by appointing appraisers for this purpose.\u00a0 It was the duty of the appraisers to hear the respective claims\u00a0 of the one and\u00a0 the other party relative to the value and assets of the business, \"and in accordance with the proof adduced relative to said values to fix and determine the same <i>for the purposes of the purchase and sale above mentioned<\/i>.\"\u00a0 They did not say for the purposes of a sale to be made in the future.\u00a0 Is the language, \"for the\u00a0 purposes of the purchase and sale above mentioned\" any the less significant or controlling than that relied upon by the plaintiff found in the first and fifth paragraphs?\u00a0 When the parties used this language they had in mind the purchase and sale which they had just made.\u00a0 According to the\u00a0 ordinary and well-understood use of the words \"purchase\" and \"sale\" they mean, in the absence of any expression to limit their significance, a transmutation of property from one party to another in consideration of some price or recompense in value; a transmission of property by a voluntary act or agreement, founded on a valuable consideration; divesting the title out of the vendor and vesting it in the vendee.\u00a0 Again, not only was the title of the plaintiff's interest vested in the defendant on the execution of the contract of May 3 but the possession of that interest was also then\u00a0 transferred to the defendant.\u00a0 (Art.\u00a0 1462, Civil Code; Uy Piaoco <i>vs<\/i>. McMicking, 10 Phil. Rep., 286.)<br\/><br\/>The total value of the business as fixed by the appraisers was final and conclusive and binding upon each of the parties.\u00a0 Neither could question the correctness of such value when once thus fixed.\u00a0 The only thing which either could then do was the one to tender and the other accept the cash.\u00a0 The one could not \"immediately sell\" and the other could not \"immediately buy\" because the purchase and sale had already taken place.\u00a0 If they could have done this then the plaintiff could have sold his interest to any other person at any time after the execution of the contract of May 3 and before November 22 for the reason that by a contract to sell only a <i>jus in personam<\/i> is created; while, by a sale a <i>jus in rem<\/i> is transferred.<br\/><br\/>Now, did the parties intend to include the profits in question\u00a0 in the purchase and sale, and did the apraisers include said profits when they fixed the total net value of La Insular?<br\/><br\/>In the second paragraph of the contract of May 3 this language was used:\u00a0 \"Whereas the respective contracting parties have been unable to agree as to the true present value of said interest of the party\u00a0 of the second\u00a0 part,\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 .\"<br\/><br\/>The \"said interest\" was the whole of the right, title, and interest of the plaintiff in the factory.\u00a0 The \"true <i>present<\/i> value\" was the\u00a0 actual value of the plaintiff's entire interest on that date, May 3.\u00a0 The appraisers\u00a0 were appointed to ascertain and fix the total net value so that the true present value, 4\/173 of the whole net value, of the plaintiff's interest might be segregated and paid for.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff\u00a0 delivered to\u00a0 the defendant or his predecessor in interest a sum of money in order to participate in the profits and\u00a0 losses that might accrue from the business denominated La Insular.\u00a0 An obligation was thereby created between the parties by virtue of which the plaintiff became the creditor and the defendant the debtor.\u00a0 The plaintiff was a creditor in a double sense, to wit: (a) For the capital invested, and (6) for the profits which that capital might produce.<br\/><br\/>This juridical relation existed on May 3, 1910, when that contract was executed and signed by the parties.\u00a0 On this date the plaintiff had:<br\/><blockquote>\"1. Right to and right of action for his capital invested in the business of La Insular,<br\/><br\/>\"2. Right to participate, in proportion to his investment, in the expansion and increase of the company's capital.<br\/><br\/>\"3. Right in proportion to his capital in all the trademarks, credit, and good will of the business.<br\/><br\/>\"4. Right to a proportional share in the annual dividends of the business on his capital invested, after deduction of the 20 per cent of said dividends to which Santa Marina is entitled in his capacity of managing partner.<br\/><br\/>\"5. Right to revise, approve or impugn the annual statements rendered by the managing partner, Santa Marina.\"<\/blockquote>The sum total of these constituted on May 3, 1910, the whole of the plaintiff's right, title, and interest in the \"La Insular.\" In the absence of something in the contract showing that the word \"whole\" (totalidad) was not used in its ordinary sense it must be understood so to have been used, and we find nothing of that kind.\u00a0 All the authorities agree that when the word \"whole\" is thus used it means the entire thing; the entire assemblage of parts; totality; all of a thing without defect or exception; comprising all the parts; complete; entire.\u00a0 Exclude one part, the remainder would not be the whole.\u00a0 \"The whole of the right, title, and interest of the said Antonio Maria Barretto in and to said joint account association\" means what it says if it means anything at all.\u00a0 Language will not admit of a clearer and more expressive statement of what was sold.\u00a0 Exclude the profits sought to be recovered then the plaintiff did not sell the whole of his right, title, and interest, he only sold a part, and a part is never\u00a0 equal to the whole.\u00a0 That the profits were a part of the plaintiff's interest is self-evident.<br\/><br\/>In the case of Alcantara <i>vs<\/i>. Alinea et al.\u00a0 (<i>supra<\/i>), the defendants borrowed P480 from the plaintiff to be returned at the expiration of an agreed period, at the same time promised that in the event of their failure to pay the borrowed money within that time they would sell him certain property for the amount of the loan, the court holding that it was a contract of loan and a promise of sale of a house and lot.\u00a0 In this case, however, the consummation of the contract of sale depended upon the failure to pay the loan.<br\/><br\/>If the loan was repaid the sale did not take\u00a0 place.\u00a0 It was uncertain whether the sale of the house and lot would be consummated until after the loan was due.\u00a0 In the case at bar was there any such uncertainty as to the sale of the property?\u00a0 The one agreed to sell and the other agreed to buy a certain specified interest in La Insular.\u00a0 This agreement was carried into effect.\u00a0 No\u00a0 subsequent contingency could affect the sale.\u00a0 The distinction between the two cases is apparent.\u00a0 It is therefore clear that the recitals from the contract and the case cited do not support the contention of the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>2. The appraisers were appointed, as we have said, to ascertain and fix the total net value of the factory for the purpose of determining the true <i>present<\/i> value of the plaintiff's entire interest therein.\u00a0 The profits for the year ending June 30, 1910, were not ascertained until some twelve days after the appraisers submitted their report.\u00a0 Such profits\u00a0 were in the possession of the association during the entire period\u00a0 from May 3 to November 22, and had not been segregated from the general mass of property up to the latter date.\u00a0 It is true that the appraisers said that they made a valuation of the assets of the business, \"taking as a basis therefor the assets of said business on June 30, 1909.\"\u00a0 The appraisers could not have based their valuation exclusively upon the assets of that date for the reason that the books of the concern had not been balanced when they concluded their work.\u00a0 In fact, we find the appraisers saying in the very same paragraph in which the above quotation appears that \"in order to act with greater certainty in the discharge of their duties they had the real estate and the machinery appraised by civil engineers and the stock of tobacco by tobacco experts.\"<br\/><br\/>The value of the real estate in the provinces and a certain small launch was fixed by the appraisers upon the testimony of competent witnesses.\u00a0 The appraisers disposed\u00a0 of the accounts of various debtors not in accordance with the inventory or the books of the company but according to their own judgment, excluding those which they found were uncollectible and deducting 25 per cent from the doubtful ones.\u00a0 So it is clear from the quotation relied upon by the plaintiff that the appraisers paid very little attention to the assets of the business on June 30, 1909, in fixing the valuation of the property.\u00a0 The stock of tobacco which was appraised by tobacco experts was not that on hand on June 30, 1909, but was the amount belonging to the association at the time the appraisement was made.\u00a0 This item alone was fixed at P1,140,259.77.\u00a0 Another item of\u00a0 assets was the cash on hand of P323,235.20.\u00a0 This was the actual amount of cash in\u00a0 the possession of the association at the time the appraisement was made and was considered as\u00a0 a part of the assets.\u00a0 In fact, according to the report of the appraisers the books of the concern showed that the total assets, not including the trade-mark and good will, amounted to P2,505,767.83 while the appraisers fixed the value at P3,049,394.07, a difference of a little over a half million pesos.\u00a0 That the appraisers\u00a0 in fixing the total net value included the accumulated profits we think there can be no question.\u00a0 These profits formed for that purpose a part of the assets.\u00a0 The appraisers could not distinguish the profits from the other personal property as such profits had not at that time been set aside and the appraisers were instructed to ascertain and fix the total net value so that the entire present value of the plaintiff's interest might be ascertained.<br\/><br\/>The contracts and the report of the appraisers are so clear and cover the entire subject matter so fully that we are convinced that the subsequent demand for the profits in question was an afterthought.\u00a0 If there had been any doubt in the mind of the plaintiff about the inclusion of the accrued profits in the sale of May 3 or that the appraisers were authorized to take into consideration such profits in fixing the total net value of the business so that the entire present value of the plaintiff's interest might be ascertained, the plaintiff would certainly have raised the question at the time.\u00a0 He remained perfectly quiet until after he had received the full value for the whole of his right, title, and interest in the factory and had solemnly declared that he \"relinquished all intervention, claim, right, or action in said factory by reason of the shares under consideration.\"\u00a0 After this he came forward for the first time and demanded his share of the profits which he had sold and received payment therefor.\u00a0 Surely he does not expect to be paid twice for the same thing.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons the judgment appealed from is reversed upon the merits and the complaint dismissed without costs in either instance.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C, J., Torres, Johnson, Carson<\/i>, and <i>Moreland, JJ.<\/i>, concur. <\/div>",

PANGLIMA INDANAN, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>MORELAND, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">An appeal from a judgment convicting the appellant of the crime of murder, and sentencing him to be hanged.<br\/><br\/>The accused\u00a0 was at the time of the commission of the crime, the headman of Parang.\u00a0 He is alleged to have committed the murder by inducement.\u00a0 The proofs tend to demonstrate that on the 24th day of March, 1912, the accused sent Induk to bring to the house of the accused one Sariol.\u00a0 The following day, Induk, in obedience to the orders, brought Sariol to the house, whereupon the accused ordered the witnesses, Akiran and Suhuri, to tie Sariol.\u00a0 They obeyed the order in the presence of the accused, who was at the time lying upon a bed in the room.\u00a0 This was about 4.30 in the afternoon.\u00a0 Sariol remained there with his hands tied behind his back until night, when the accused, in the presence of, several witnesses, ordered Sariol to be taken to the Chinese cemetery and there killed, the accused asserting at the time that he had an order to that effect from the governor.\u00a0 He gave strict orders to Akiran that he should be present at the time that Sariol was killed, and that he should aid in killing him.\u00a0 To make sure of the work being well done, the accused ordered Akiran to take his (the accused's) bolo with which to assist in the killing.\u00a0 Sariol was taken to the cemetery, in an isolated spot a considerable distance from the road and about 200 yards from the nearest house, and there killed.\u00a0 Kalyakan struck the first blow with his bolo, while Akiran joined in and assisted thereafter.\u00a0 The deceased at the time he was killed had his hands tied behind his back.\u00a0 On returning to the house of the accused after the death of Sariol, Unding told the accused that Sariol had been killed, whereupon the accused said that it was all right and appeared to be very much pleased.<br\/><br\/>The proofs demonstrate beyond question that the accused was the recognized headman of Parang, and it appears from the testimony of the witnesses, Kalyakan, Suhuri, and Akiran, that he had a very powerful influence over them, hence his power over them was such that any order issued by him had the force and efficacy of physical coercion.\u00a0 One of the witnesses testified:\u00a0 \"He (the accused) knows what is good and what is bad, and he is the headman of the governor.\u00a0 He is the headman of Parang.\"\u00a0 And in answer to the\u00a0 question,\u00a0 \"He is the biggest chief in the Parang ward?\"\u00a0 replied:\u00a0 \"There is none, only himself.\" He further said:\u00a0 \"The people do not hesitate to take his orders because he is the headman of the governor.\"\u00a0 Later, in reply to the question, \"If he were to get angry with the people, what would he do to them?\" this witness answered:\u00a0 \"I do not know; might kill them.\"\u00a0 Another witness, answering the question as to why he did not run away instead of going to the Chinese cemetery as the accused ordered him, answered:\u00a0 \"The reason why I did not run away, well, take the same thing as the Government soldiers.\u00a0 They are told to do a thing and they do it.\"\u00a0 Prior to this time the same witness had said:\u00a0 \"If a chief says anything to a man like me and tells me it is by order of the governor and that he has a warrant there, well, a man like me does what he tells me.\"\u00a0 Another witness declared,: \"I am afraid of him.\u00a0 I did not believe that he would make me do anything unjust.\"\u00a0 The same witness afterwards testified in answer to the question:\u00a0 \"Would you have killed this man if any other person besides Panglima, the headman, had ordered you to?\"\u00a0 \"I would not.\"\u00a0 Another witness declared:\u00a0 \"Well, he was the headman.\u00a0 It was the headman's orders,sand if we did not do it, he would get angry with us.\"\u00a0 This witness, answering the question, \"Did Panglima make you think that he was acting under the orders of the Government in causing this man to be killed?\" testified:\u00a0 \"He said, 'I have a warrant here.'\u00a0 \" To the question, \"And you thought that it was a legal execution, did you?\" answered,<br\/><br\/>\"Yes, because he (the accused) is not afraid of the governor.\"<br\/><br\/>We are of the opinion that the domination of the accused over the persons who, at his orders, killed the deceased was such as to make him responsible for whatever they did in obedience to such orders.<br\/><br\/>Article 13, paragraph 2, of the Penal Code declares those to be principals in a crime \"who directly force or induce others to commit it.\"<br\/><br\/>Commenting upon this paragraph, Viada says:<br\/><blockquote>\"They <i>force<\/i> another to commit a crime who physically, by actual force or grave fear, for example, with a pistol in hand or by any other threatening means, oblige another to commit the crime.\u00a0 In our commentary on paragraph 9 of article 8 (page 28), we have already said that he who suffers violence acts without will and against his will, is no more than an instrument, and therefore is guilty of no wrong.\u00a0 The real culprits in such case, the only guilty persons, are those who use the violence, those who\u00a0 <i>force<\/i> the other to commit the crime.<br\/><br\/>\"One is <i>induced directly<\/i> to commit a crime either by <i>command<\/i>, or for a <i>consideration<\/i>, or by any other similar act which constitutes the real and moving cause of the crime and which was done for the purpose of inducing such criminal act and was sufficient for that purpose.\u00a0 We have already seen in our commentary on paragraph 12 of article 8 that the one who physically commits the crime may escape criminal responsibility by showing that he acted with due obedience to an order; in such case the criminal responsibility falls entirely upon the one who orders, that is, upon him who by his commands has directly induced the other to commit the act.\u00a0 But in case the obedience of the inferior is not due to the superior and therefore not necessary, and does not, therefore, exempt him from criminal responsibility as the physical author of the crime, he who thus, by his command, directly induced him to the criminal act is considered by the law\u00a0 also as a principal in the crime.<br\/><br\/>\"The <i>pacto<\/i> by virtue of which one purchases for a consideration the hand which commits the crime makes him who gives, promises, or offers the consideration the principal in the crime by direct inducement, because without such offer or promise the criminal act would never have been committed.\u00a0 But this does not mean that the one who actually commits the crime by reason of such promise, remuneration or reward is exempted from criminal responsibility; on the contrary, we have already seen in our comments on paragraph 3 of article 10 that such circumstance constitutes an <i>aggravation<\/i> of his crime.<br\/><br\/>\"We have heretofore said that in addition to the <i>precepto<\/i> and the <i>pacto<\/i> there are similar means by which another may be induced to commit a crime which also make the one who offers the inducement the principal in the crime by virtue of the provisions of article 13, paragraph 2.\u00a0 But it must be borne in mind\u00a0 that these <i>acts<\/i> of inducement do not consist in simple <i>advice<\/i> or counsel given before the act is committed,\u00a0 or in simple <i>words<\/i> uttered at the time the act was committed.\u00a0 Such advice and such words constitute undoubtedly an evil\u00a0 act, an inducement condemned by the moral law; but in order that, under the provisions of the Code, such act can be considered direct inducement, it is necessary that such advice or such words have a great dominance and great influence over the person who acts; it is necessary that they be as direct, as efficacious, as powerful as physical or moral coercion or as violence itself,\"<\/blockquote>The following decisions of the supreme court of Spain illustrate the principles involved and their application to particular cases:<br\/><br\/>It was held by that court on the 14th day of April, 1871, that one who, during a\u00a0 riot in which a person was killed, said to one of the combatants, \"Stab him! Stab him!\", it not appearing that he did anything more than say these words except to be present at the fight, was not guilty of the crime of homicide by inducement, the court saying that, \"considering that, although the phrases pronounced were imprudent and even culpable, they were not so to the extent that they may be considered the principal and moving cause of the effect produced; direct inducement cannot be inferred from such phrases, as inducement must precede the act induced and must be so influential in producing the criminal act that without it the act would not have been performed.\"<br\/><br\/>In a decision rendered on the 10th of July, 1877, the principle was laid down that \"a person who advised a married woman whose husband was very stingy and treated her badly that the only thing for her to do was to rob him, was not guilty of the crime of robbery by inducement, for the reason that imprudent and ill-conceived advice is not sufficient.\"<br\/><br\/>In a decision of the 22d of December, 1883, it was held that a father who simply said to his son who was at the time engaged in combat with another, \"Hit him! Hit him!\", was not responsible for the injuries committed after such advice was given, under the facts presented.\u00a0 The court said:\u00a0 \"It being held in mind that the inducement to the commission of the crime by means of which a person may be considered a principal in the same manner as he who executes the act itself can only be founded in commands, sometimes in advice, in considerations, or by inducement so powerful that it alone produces the criminal act.\u00a0 None of these characteristics pertain\u00a0 to the words of Miguel Perez, inasmuch as the circumstances which surrounded the event at the time do not appear in sufficient detail to show with clearness the effects which the words\u00a0 produced, or the relative situation of the deceased and of the one who killed him, or the point to which the fight had progressed at the time the words were spoken.\u00a0 Moreover, the decision of the court below does not show sufficient facts upon which to affirm that Miguel foresaw the use of the firearm on the part of his son when he spoke the words referred to, or, for that reason, that he thereby induced him to use said weapon.\"<br\/><br\/>In a decision of the 19th of December, 1896, the court held that the fact \"of having proposed to other persons the abstraction of the tickets which were the subject matter of the robbery, at the same time telling them the place where they were to be found, does\u00a0 not constitute inducement to commit the robbery because the proposal to commit the robbery was not sufficiently efficacious to be the cause of the crime, as the crime, under the facts, could have been committed\u00a0 without it; nor was the, indication of the place where the money was to be found a sufficient motive to induce the robbery.\"<br\/><br\/>The foregoing decisions have been presented for the purpose of showing concrete cases in which the acts of the accused were not sufficient, as matter of law, to constitute inducement.\u00a0 They not only lay down the legal principles which govern in prosecutions of this character, but they also illustrate in the most valuable way the application of those principles to actual cases.<br\/><br\/>The following decisions of the same court present instances in which the acts of the\u00a0 accused constitute inducement under the\u00a0 law and illustrate the application of the principles to concrete cases.<br\/><br\/>In a decision of the 14th of April, 1871, the facts as stated by the court were:\u00a0 \"It appeared that Lulu, who was living with Joe and Zozo (a married couple) in the town of X, gave birth, to a child on the morning of the 28th of March, the offspring of her illicit relations with William.\u00a0 It had been previously agreed upon by the first three named to deliver the child to William as soon as it was born, with instructions to deposit it in some frequented place so that it might be found and taken up; but Joe changed his mind and handed the child over to the father, telling him, 'Here is your child, do with it whatever you please; throw it into the sea if you choose to which the latter actually did.\"\u00a0 Under the facts the accused\u00a0 was held guilty by inducement.<br\/><br\/>In a judgment pronounced on the 22d of January, 1873, it was held that \"a woman who, living with a man in scandalous concubinage in the presence of a daughter who continually manifested her disgust and repugnance for such conduct, conceived against the daughter the most profound hatred and conceived the purpose of killing her by most insidious methods, obtaining for that purpose poison and various deadly weapons, and contriving that she and her family and all of the tenants in the house should go to the theater on an evening during which the daughter was sick and obliged to remain at home, in order that her lover might be entirely undisturbed in killing the daughter and that he might not be surprised in the act, such woman is the author and principal of the crime the same as her lover who actually committed the deed.\"<br\/><br\/>In a decision of the 6th of July, 1881, the court held that \"one who takes advantage of his position as an inspector for the maintenance of public peace and proposes to a private citizen the perpetration of a robbery, with the threat that unless he did commit the robbery he would be arrested as an escaped prisoner, at the same time offering to withdraw the officers from the vicinity of the place to be robbed, and who after the robbery received a part of the booty, was guilty of the crime as principal, although he did not take personal part therein.\"<br\/><br\/>In a decision of the 12th of April, 1882, it was said that \"an alcalde of a barrio who, accompanied by a number of peace officers, ordered them to stop certain music that was being played in the public street, and after the order had been obeyed and the music stopped one of the persons expressed his resentment against the act whereupon the alcalde ordered the peace officers to attack the man, which they did, inflicting upon him various wounds, was guilty of the crime of <i>lesiones graves<\/i> by inducement.\"<br\/><br\/>In a decision of the 21st of June, 1882, it was stated that \"a father who from the balcony of his house cried out in a loud voice to his sons who were fighting with others to kill those with whom they were fighting before they were killed themselves, because they might as well go to jail for a big thing as a little, was guilty of the crime of <i>lesiones graves<\/i> by inducement by reason of the injuries inflicted under such orders.\"<br\/><br\/>In a decision of the 22d day of December, 1883, the court said, \"that the inducement and the commission of a crime whereby the inducer becomes a principal to the same extent and effect as if he had physically committed the crime exist merely in acts of command, sometimes of advice, or agreement for a consideration, or through influence so effective that it alone determines the commission of the crime.\"<br\/><br\/>In a decision of the 11th of November, 1884, the court laid down the proposition that the secretary of the <i>ayuntamiento<\/i> who induced certain persons to form new lists <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">compromisarios<\/span> of  five days prior to the election of senators was guilty as principal of the crime against the election lists, saying:\u00a0 \"It appearing and it being a fact proved that the secretary of the <i>ayuntamiento<\/i> of Jalom, Miguel Antonio Dura, induced the members of the council to commit the act stated, his participation\u00a0 as principal in the commission of the act is well established according to the provisions of paragraph 2, article 13, of the Penal Code, because such inducement coming from a person of such influence as the secretary of the <i>ayuntamiento<\/i> in a small village\u00a0 must be considered sufficiently dominant to turn the mind\u00a0 of those induced.\"<br\/><br\/>In a decision rendered on the 28th of December, 1886, it was held that a woman who was at enmity with an uncle for having refused to renounce in her favor a donation which a relative had given to him, who made frequent threats to kill the uncle and who finally offered a third person a certain sum of money together with the land involved in the donation if he would kill the uncle, and who told her son that, if they were unable to get anybody else to kill\u00a0 the uncle, he must do it himself as he would thus inherit, 15,000 <i>pesetas<\/i> with which they could flee abroad, and in case he refused to do it he must leave the house because he was a coward, was guilty as principal of the crime of murder\u00a0 committed by the son under such inducement.\u00a0 The court said: \"It being borne in mind that the suggestions with which the mother moved the mind of her son to kill the uncle had the force of a real inducement and inclined and decided the will of the son by means of the relations which she bore to him as well as the reward which\u00a0 she held up before him.\"<br\/><br\/>In a decision of the 26th of January, 1888, it was held that finding as principal in a crime, him who, \"by direct and influential means and taking advantage of the inexperience of a boy of tender age,\" induces him to commit a crime, was warranted by law, the court saying that \"in view of the\u00a0 fact that the inducement exercised by Juan Santiso with regard to the boy, Ramon Carballo, to steal the jewels in question from his grandmother's house shows such a direct and inducing cause of the criminal act that without such inducement the crime would not have been committed.\"<br\/><br\/>In a decision of the 9th of April, 1892, the court held \"that the inducement referred to in paragraph 2, article 13, of the Penal Code exists whenever the act performed by the physical author of the crime is determined by the influence of the inducer over the mind of him who commits the act, whatever be the source of such influence.\"<br\/><br\/>In a decision of the 3d of February, 1897, it was declared that one was the \"principal by inducement in five different larcenies,\u00a0 it having been proved that the inducer, knowing that the oil which was brought to her for sale was stolen by the persons who were seeking to sell it to her, advised them thereupon to continue stealing oil and furnished them vessels in which to carry it and contributed on five different occasions to the realization of the larcenies, it appearing that the physical authors of the crime were boys under 15 years of age and that they acted upon the suggestions of the inducer without discernment or judgment of their own,\" the court saying that in view of the fact that she knew that the oil which she first purchased from the boys was stolen oil, that the boys were less than 15 years of age, and therefore easily led, that she furnished the vessels in which to carry the stolen property\u2014all indicate conclusively that the five crimes were committed by the influence exercised by the woman, which inducement was not merely that of favoring the execution of the crime but was that which determined its commission,\"<br\/><br\/>In a decision of the 31st of May,1898, it was laid down \"that the command of a master to his servant, by reason of the special relations which exist between them, contains the elements of inducement which makes the master who orders such servant to cut wood belonging to a third person, in order that he might benefit thereby, the principal of the crime committed by such servant,\" the court saying that \"in view of the fact that the command of the master to the servant, made within the sphere and under the ordinary conditions of domestic life, when they relate to acts simple and apparently legitimate, contains the necessary elements, directly and sufficiently efficacious, of inducement according to the provisions of paragraph 2 of article 13 of the Penal Code, it appearing that the master, taking advantage of the ascendency and authority which he naturally must exercise over his servant or inferior, ordered him to cut and carry away wood from land which he knew did not belong to him, without disclosing to the servant that circumstance, which concealment gave rise to the influence which the master exercised over the servant in that particular act.\"<br\/><br\/>The following decisions of the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands apply the foregoing principles to particular cases.<br\/><br\/>In the case of the United States <i>vs<\/i>. Galuran (12 Phil. Rep., S39) it appeared that one of the defendants conceived the idea of the robbery of a warehouse and assisted in procuring false keys with which to open it.\u00a0 He took no immediate part in the act of robbery itself.\u00a0 The court in its opinion said:<br\/><blockquote>\"These facts, which we hold to have been proven, clearly show the guilt of the appellant, Sy-Yoc, as the instigator of the crime herein prosecuted.\u00a0 From him came the initiative in the robbery; he was the first to conceive the idea of its commission, and, being unable or unwilling to carry it out himself, he employed Galuran, impelling him to the material execution of the crime by a promise to pay-him P16 for each case of whisky that he was able to steal.\u00a0 The better to induce him to commit the offense, he clearly demonstrated how easily it could be accomplished, instructed him as to the best means of carrying it out, and offered him money to pay for the false\u00a0 key.\u00a0 He thus removed all the difficulties in the way of the determination to execute, and the actual execution of the robbery in question.\u00a0 These acts constitute a real inducement made directly for the commission of the said robbery, and place the appellant, Sy-Yoc, in the position of principal in accordance with paragraph 2 of article 13 of the Penal Code.\"<\/blockquote>In the case of the United States <i>vs<\/i>. Ancheta (15 Phil. Rep., 470) it appeared that\u00a0 the accused induced certain Igorrotes to kill a third person by holding up before them the fact that by such act they would be able to obtain P40 which was then in the house of the victim, as well as the carabao which he owned, saying to them, \"If you go to work you only make a little; it is better to kill this man and take his carabao and the P40 which was received from the sale of the house in town.\"\u00a0 They having made an unsuccessful attempt upon the life of the proposed victim and having returned and explained why they had not been able to kill him, the accused said to them:\u00a0 \"Why did you eat my chickens if you are not going to do what I told you to do.\u00a0 I came here to spend the night in Cambaguio because I thought you were going to kill him.\"\u00a0 The Igorrotes then spent three days clearing some land for another person from whom they received P2.25.\u00a0 About noon of the third day of their work, the defendant went to them and said:\u00a0 \"Now you must repeat what I told you to do, and comply with our agreement; I am going to Ululing today, and I wish you to kill Tiburcio tonight.\u00a0 You go to the bushes and conceal yourselves in the same place you were concealed before.\"\u00a0 The murder was committed as proposed.\u00a0 Upon these facts the court held that the accused\u00a0 was the instigator and inducer of the crime, and that he was liable as principal.\u00a0 (Supreme court of Spain, 20th of October, 1881, 7th of January, 1887, 12th of January, 1889.)<br\/><br\/>In the case of the United States <i>vs<\/i>. Empinado (17 Phil. Rep., 230) it appeared that the accused had a conversation with Serapio Tapic, a laborer, in which the accused asked him if he knew Antonio Gavato and his associates, to which he replied in the negative.\u00a0 The defendant then said:\u00a0 \"I wish to confer upon you a commission, which is as follows:\u00a0 Order must be disturbed in the cockpit of Gavato, and when you arrive there wound any person.\"\u00a0 It seems that Tapic was reluctant to obey this order, but defendant gave him something to eat and drink until he became intoxicated, and then gave him a bolo and P10 and said:\u00a0 \"Comply with what I have ordered and in case you incur any responsibility I will be responsible to the court, and as soon as you wound any person or persons, return to me and I will defend you.\"\u00a0 The court held that these facts constituted sufficient inducement to bring the accused within the provisions of article 13, paragraph 2, of the Penal Code.<br\/><br\/>In the case of the United States <i>vs<\/i>. Gamao (23 Phil. Rep., 81) the court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"Mauricio Gamao, nephew of Gil Gamao, was a poor, ignorant fisherman, and more or less dependent upon his uncle for subsistence.\u00a0 On the other hand, Capt. Gil Gamao was, when this crime was committed, a man of great influence in Escalante.\u00a0 He had a great number of people working for him, one of whom was his nephew Mauricio.\u00a0 He was the local political leader of his party.\u00a0 One of his nephews was president of the town.\u00a0 He had two brothers-in-law in the municipal council.\u00a0 Of his nephews, one was chief of police and two others were members of the police force.\u00a0 He had acquired, as we have said, a bitter hatred toward the Roman Catholic Church and the Spanish friars and priests.\u00a0 He called a meeting in his own house on the afternoon of May 15, where the question of murdering the priest was discussed.\u00a0 He was the prime mover in this meeting.\u00a0 He dominated all who were present.\u00a0 He selected his nephew Mauricio to commit the crime and directed him to do it.\u00a0 Mauricio, immediately after murdering the priest, returned to the house of his uncle Gil and reported the fact.\u00a0 The influence exercised by Gil Gamao over his nephew was so great and powerful that the latter, through fear, could not resist it. That Mauricio was directly induced to murder the priest by his uncle Gil we think there can be no question.\"<\/blockquote>In the case of the United States <i>vs<\/i>. Chan Guy Juan (23 Phil. Rep., 105) it was held that the \"one who employs an innocent agent to commit a crime is liable as a principal, although he does nothing himself in the actual commission of the crime.\"<br\/><br\/>In the case of the United States <i>vs<\/i>. Alcontin (10 Off. Gaz., 1888) it appeared that \"a married woman suggested to her paramour, with whom she had been maintaining illicit relations that he kill her husband in order that thereafter they might live together freely.\u00a0 The paramour acting upon these suggestion and actuated by a desire to possess the woman for himself without the interference of the husband, killed him.\u00a0 The guilty pair immediately thereafter made their escape and lived together as man and wife until the time of their arrest.\"\u00a0 Upon these facts the court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"We think that the direct inducement to the commission of the crime is fully established <i>por pacto<\/i> (for a consideration); that is to say, on the understanding that the woman would live in illicit relations with the murderer after the death of her husband; and <i>por precepto<\/i> (by precept) which constituted 'a real, intentional, direct and efficacious exciting inducement <i>(excitacion)<\/i> to commit the crime.'\u00a0 The propositions and suggestions of the woman constituted something more than mere\u00a0 counsel or advice which her codefendant was entirely free to accept or not, in that they were coupled with a consideration which, in view of the relations existing between them, furnished a motive strong enough to induce the man to take the life of her husband; and for the further reason that due to these illicit relations\u00a0 she had acquired such an influence over her codefendant that her insistent suggestions that he commit the crime had a marked and controlling influence upon his mind.\"<\/blockquote>In the case of the United States <i>vs<\/i>. Matinong (22 Phil. Rep., 439) it appeared that the accused proposed to his companions an assault upon the house of Francisco Tolosa; that armed with a <i>talibon<\/i> he accompanied them during the assault; that, while\u00a0 the assault was being made, he stood watch at the foot of the stairs of said house so that his companions would not be caught, and\u00a0 that, finally, he accompanied them to the place where the deceased was killed.\u00a0 These facts were held by the court to be sufficient to make the accused a principal by inducement as well as by direct participation.<br\/><br\/>In the case at bar,the words and acts of the accused had the effect of a command.\u00a0 There does not seem to have existed, however, any official relation between the accused and the persons whom he induced to kill Sariol.\u00a0 While he appears to have been the headman of Parang, those whom he induced held no official position under him and owed him, legally speaking, no obedience.\u00a0 According to tradition and custom, however, the headman seems to have been a person whose word was law and whose commands were to be obeyed.\u00a0 Moreover, the accused represented to those who physically committed the crime that he had a warrant from the governor authorizing, if not requiring, the acts committed, and urged upon them, in effect, that all must obey the commands of the Government.\u00a0 This representation was false, but it produced the same effect as if it had been true.\u00a0 It cannot be doubted that the accused knew the representation was false and purposely and intentionally made it as an additional factor going to insure obedience to his orders.<br\/><br\/>Even if there should happen to be lacking any element sufficient to bring the acts of the accused within the definition of inducement by command, and we do not believe there is, there would still remain all of the elements necessary to qualify the crime as murder by inducement.\u00a0 From the authorities heretofore cited and the principles laid down therein as those which must govern in the determination of whether or not the acts of an accused constitute inducement under the law, it may be stated as a general proposition that, where the inducement offered by the accused is of such a nature and made in such a way that it becomes the determining cause of the crime, and such inducement was offered with the intention of producing that result, then the accused is guilty by inducement of the crime committed by the person so induced.\u00a0 The inducement to the crime must be intentional on the part of the inducer\u00a0 and must be made directly for the purpose in view.<br\/><br\/>The verb \"induce\" is sufficiently broad, generally speaking, to cover cases where there exists on the part of the inducer the most positive resolution and the most persistent effort to secure the commission of the crime, together with the presentation to the person induced of the very strongest kind of temptation, as well as words or acts which are merely the result of indiscretion or lack of reflection and which carry with them, inherently, almost nothing of inducement or temptation.\u00a0 A chance word spoken without reflection, a wrong appreciation of a situation, an ironical phrase, a thoughtless act, may give birth to a thought of, or even a resolution to, crime in the mind of one for some independent reason predisposed thereto without the one who spoke the word or performed the act having any expectation that his suggestion would be followed or any real intention that it produce a result.\u00a0 In such case, while the expression was imprudent and the results of it grave in the extreme, he would not be guilty of the crime committed.\u00a0 Therefore, in applying the principles laid down to\u00a0 concrete cases it is necessary to remember only that the inducement must be made directly with the intention of procuring\u00a0 the commission of the crime and that such inducement must be the determining cause of the crime.<br\/><br\/>In the case before us, as we have seen, the accused falsely represented to\u00a0 the persons who actually committed the crime that he had an order from the Government requiring the death of Sariol and that they were under obligation to carry put that order.\u00a0 It is clear from the evidence that this inducement was offered by the accused directly to the persons interested with the intention of moving them to do his bidding, and that such representation was the moving cause of the fatal act.\u00a0 While it may be said, and is true, that the personal commands of the accused were entirely sufficient to produce the effects which actually resulted and that such commands may be considered the moving cause of the crime, still there is no doubt, under the evidence, that the representation that the accused had in his possession an order from the Government commanding the death of Sariol was also of material influence in effecting the death; and where two fundamental causes work together for the production of a single result and one of those causes would lead to a conviction upon one theory and the other upon another, a conviction is sustainable upon either theory.<br\/><br\/>There was present premeditation, qualifying the crime as murder.\u00a0 There were present, also, the aggravating circumstances of <i>despoblado<\/i> and nocturnity.<br\/><br\/>We are of the firm conviction that the judgment of the court below is well founded, and we accordingly affirm the same, with costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Gale, then holding, by special appointment, a term of court in the Province of Tarlac, confirming the report of the commissioners and entering judgment in conformity therewith.\u00a0 On the 6th day of May, 1912, said Herbert D. Gale having left the province and the Honorable Julio Llorente, the judge regularly sitting in that province, having returned to duty, a motion\u00a0 was made before him for a new trial upon several grounds, among them being that fraud had been practiced upon the plaintiffs and the court\u00a0 by the defendants; that the judgment was against the weight of the evidence; that it was contrary to law; that the damages allowed were excessive; and also upon the ground of newly discovered evidence.\u00a0 In addition to these grounds others were urged at various times by the applicant for a new trial.\u00a0 After duly considering the motion and the arguments of counsel, the court vacated the judgment confirming the report of the commissioners, set aside the report itself, and ordered a new trial.<br\/><br\/>This petition for certiorari is based upon the ground that the Court of First Instance, having once entered a judgment confirming the report of the commissioners in a condemnation proceeding, has no authority or jurisdiction to entertain a motion for, or to grant, a new trial.\u00a0 To support this contention several special arguments\u00a0 were made by the petitioners :<br\/><br\/>They argued that all of the grounds upon which the application\u00a0 for a new trial was based were presented to the court and passed upon by it at the time of the confirmation of the referees' report; that the application for a new trial was not made in good faith but had ulterior purposes; that the alleged newly discovered evidence was not such in fact and did not fall within the provisions of the code and the decisions of this court sufficiently to warrant the granting of a new trial upon that ground.\u00a0 Other arguments of a similar character were made and urged with force and earnestness.<br\/><br\/>We do not stop to consider the merits of these arguments or to pass upon them one way or the other.\u00a0 We simply say in regard to them that they do not, in any sense, go to the power, authority or jurisdiction of the court to act in the premises.\u00a0 They deal, rather, with the proposition whether the court committed an error in its decision.\u00a0 In other words, such arguments as these are not founded in\u00a0 the lack of jurisdiction of the court or in the excess\u00a0 thereof, but in errors committed in the exercise of that jurisdiction.\u00a0 We have recently said in the case of Herrera <i>vs<\/i>. Barretto and Joaquin (p. 245, <i>ante<\/i>) that if a court has\u00a0 jurisdiction of the subject matter and of the person, decisions\u00a0 upon all questions pertaining to the cause are decisions within its jurisdiction, and, however irregular or erroneous they may be, cannot be corrected by certiorari.\u00a0 In that case we said:<br\/><blockquote>\"It has been repeatedly held by this court that a writ of certiorari will not be issued unless\u00a0 it clearly appears that the court\u00a0 to which it is to be directed acted without or in excess of\u00a0 jurisdiction.\u00a0 It will not be issued to cure errors in the proceedings or to correct erroneous conclusions of law or of fact.\u00a0 If the court has jurisdiction of the subject matter and of the person, decisions upon all questions pertaining to the cause are decisions within its jurisdiction and, however irregular or erroneous they may be, cannot be corrected by certiorari.\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 * *\u00a0 While the issuance of the mandatory injunction in this particular case may have been grossly irregular and erroneous\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 nevertheless its issuance was within the jurisdiction of the court and its action is not reviewable on certiorari.\u00a0 It is not sufficient to say that it was issued wrongfully and without sufficient grounds and in the absence of the other party.\u00a0 The question is, did the court act with jurisdiction?<br\/><br\/>\"*\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 One of the fundamental questions in a mandamus against a public officer is whether or not that officer has the right to exercise discretion in the performance\u00a0 of the act which the plaintiff asks him to perform.\u00a0 It is one of the essential determinations of the cause.\u00a0 To claim that the resolution of that question may deprive the court of jurisdiction is to assert a novel proposition.\u00a0 It is equivalent to the contention that a court has jurisdiction if he decides right but no jurisdiction if he decides wrong.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 In the case at bar no one denies the power, authority, or jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance to take cognizance of an action for mandamus and to decide every question which arises in that cause and pertains thereto.\u00a0 The contention that the decision of one of those questions, if wrong, destroys jurisdiction, involves an evident contradiction.<br\/><br\/>\"Jurisdiction is the authority to hear and determine a cause\u2014the right to act in a case.\u00a0 Since it is the power to hear and determine, it does not depend either upon the regularity of the exercise of that power or upon the rightfulness of the decisions made.\u00a0 Jurisdiction should therefore be distinguished from the exercise of jurisdiction.\u00a0 The authority to decide a cause at all, and not the decision rendered therein, is what makes up jurisdiction.\u00a0 Where there is jurisdiction of the person and subject matter, as we have said before, the decision of all other questions arising in the case is but an exercise of that jurisdiction.\"<\/blockquote>From these observations it is clear that the arguments urged by counsel above referred to do not touch the jurisdiction or power of the court to act in the premises, but simply challenge his right to act in a given way.<br\/><br\/>It is also contended that in a proceeding for the condemnation of real estate, the court, after entering a judgment confirming the report of the commissioners, loses jurisdiction and control of the action and cannot thereafter touch or alter the judgment in any way.\u00a0 An earnest and forceful argument was made to sustain this proposition, and reference was had to the various sections of the condemnation act to strengthen it.\u00a0 We are of the opinion, however, that the proposition is not sustainable.<br\/><br\/>An action for the condemnation of real estate is, in this jurisdiction, so far as procedure and appeals are concerned an ordinary action.\u00a0 It is begun by summons and complaint, to which may be interposed an answer and demurrer as in other actions; and from the judgment therein an appeal may be taken by bill of exceptions as in other cases.\u00a0 It differs essentially from other actions only in the fact that it has commissioners for the determination of certain questions in the case, and the court, in acting on the referees' report, performs a somewhat different function from that which he performs in ordinary actions.\u00a0 This fact, however, does not alter the essential character of the\u00a0 action, so far as the procedure is concerned or so far as\u00a0 it affects the\u00a0 right to appeal.<br\/><br\/>The fact that the plaintiff in condemnation proceedings may, immediately on the filing of judgment in its favor, enter into possession of the premises and begin the projected improvements thereon, is not sufficient upon which to base an argument that the judgment becomes instantly final and absolute and not subject to modification or vacation.\u00a0 It seems to us that the fact that the statute permits an appeal by bill of exceptions destroys completely that proposition.\u00a0 With the right to attack a judgment in an appellate court goes the corollary right to attack it in the court below.\u00a0 The concession of the appeal is an admission that the judgment is not final in the absolute sense.\u00a0 It is open to attack, and if it may be attacked in one place it may in the other.\u00a0 It would be unreasonable to give to a party the right to appeal from a judgment which was erroneous and unsustainable, and at the same time not concede the opportunity of avoiding the expense and delay of an appeal by a motion to the court to correct the judgment and thereby cure the errors.\u00a0 If one is given by law the right of an appeal it would seem that he would have the corresponding right to obtain the same remedy by the usual and ordinary course of a motion to correct the judgment or for a new trial; and it would appear to be but reasonable that a court from whose judgment an appeal may be taken should have the power, where error is patent and obvious, to avoid a\u00a0 reversal by itself correcting the judgment upon motion or by granting a new trial.<br\/><br\/>Furthermore, it is, generally speaking, the inherent power of every court whose jurisdiction is general and superior to hear, with certain limitations as to time, motions for the correction of errors in the\u00a0 judgment and for the granting of new trials where the errors are such that they cannot be corrected by mere modification of the judgment.\u00a0 In the case of Arnedo <i>vs<\/i>. Liongson (18 Phil. Rep., 257) the court said at pages 264 and 265:<br\/><blockquote>\"We are of opinion, however, that under the new system of procedure and organization of the courts no such rigid limitation on the right to amend and vacate judgments is prescribed by law or required by sound rules of practice: for while on the one hand the common-law rule under which plenary control over its judgments is held to be in all courts during the term wherein they are entered is not applicable here for the reasons above stated, on the other hand, the reasons for denying to courts the rig-lit to set final judgments aside in their discretion do not demand or require the denial to the courts of plenary control over the proceedings, including the judgment, up to the moment when the judgment becomes final in the sense that the party in whose\u00a0 favor it is rendered is entitled to execution thereon as of right.'\u00a0 Our statutes definitely prescribe the time\u00a0 when executions may issue as of right and does not leave its determination to the discretion of the court.\u00a0 Up to this time none of the parties can be said to have acquired any definite\u00a0 right in or to the judgment, and they have no just cause of complaint if prior thereto the court takes such action as may be necessary to correct any error into which in its opinion it may have fallen, and if an appeal lies from the judgment, such action on the part of the court may well avoid unnecessary and wasteful expense and delay incident to an appeal, reversal, and new trial.\"<br\/><br\/>Also, at page 267 the court said:\u00a0 \"Again, since the express authority to grant new trials under the provisions of section 145 of the Code of Civil Procedure is limited to cases wherein the judgments thus set aside are rendered in 'actions,' it is clear that this section can have no direct application in cases wherein the question is one of setting aside judgments, orders, and decrees entered in\u00a0 the special proceedings dealt with in Part II of the code, or decrees adjudicating title in the Courts of Land Registration, or in any other proceeding which does not fall under the definition of the word 'action as found in section 1 of the code.\u00a0 But the mere failure expressly to confer upon the courts the power to grant new trials in this numerous class of cases should not and cannot be construed as a denial to the courts in these Islands of the jurisdiction to grant new trials so universally recognized in the system of procedure in England and\u00a0 the United States from whence the body of our procedural law has been adopted, so far as such jurisdiction is not inconsistent with the general system of procedural law in force in these Islands.\u00a0 Indeed the right to vacate such judgments and grant new trials has always been freely exercised by the courts throughout the Islands,\u00a0 and the only questions in respect to this very salutary practice which are properly open for consideration at this time are the limitations and restrictions under which the right should be exercised.\u00a0 And while we cannot have recourse to the common-law rule of practice which is predicated on the so-called 'term system' of procedure and practice in determining these limitations and restrictions, we think that applying to our system of procedure and practice the reasoning upon which that rule is based, which is as applicable here as in England or the United States, the plenary power of the court over its proceedings in the absence of express statute, must be held to terminate when the judgment becomes final in the sense that the party in whose favor the judgment is rendered is entitled to have execution thereon as of right.\"<\/blockquote>Courts of First Instance have general jurisdiction over actions for the condemnation of real estate, and, within the sphere of action, their power and authority are\u00a0 no more restricted than in other actions which properly come before them.\u00a0 To deprive a court, under such circumstances, of power to modify or vacate its own judgment would be to limit its power without authority of the statute and in violation of precedent.<br\/><br\/>The petitioners for certiorari, to support their contention, have referred to the case of Arnedo <i>vs<\/i>. Liongson, already referred to.\u00a0 That case does not in our judgment sustain the proposition to which it was cited.\u00a0 It is true that we held in that case that:\u00a0 \"In the absence of statutory provisions expressly extending the time within which the courts in these Islands may vacate judgments on the\u00a0 ground of error of fact or of law into which the court may be of opinion that it has fallen, these courts have no jurisdiction thus to vacate judgments after they have become final in the sense that the party in whose favor they are rendered is entitled <i>as of right<\/i>, to have execution thereon.\"<br\/><br\/>But it is also true that we held in that case that: \"When not otherwise provided by statute, all courts in the Islands have plenary control over the proceedings had before them, as also of judgments entered therein, until such judgments become final in the sense that the party in whose favor they are rendered is entitled as <i>of right<\/i>, to have execution thereon, and, in the exercise of a sound discretion, the courts may take such action touching the vacation and amendment of these judgments as truth and justice may require.\"<br\/><br\/>In discussing this case it should be\u00a0 noted, in the first place, that it dealt with a petition for certiorari in a contested election proceeding.\u00a0 This court has held in numerous cases that proceedings to contest an election are proceedings of a special nature in which the power and jurisdiction of the court are distinctly limited, and, in those proceedings, it has only such power as is expressly conferred by the statute or is necessarily implied.\u00a0 In other words, it is, in that case, a court of limited jurisdiction.\u00a0 In the Liongson case above cited the court said at page 272:<br\/><blockquote>\"The remedy furnished for the trial of election contests, such as that under consideration, is one of the provisions of a general election law.\u00a0 Its peculiar and distinguishing features are manifestly the result of the demands of public policy that such contests should be instituted with the utmost promptitude, and dispatched and determined in the most summary manner consistent with the right of\u00a0 the various contestants to have an opportunity to be heard, and to submit evidence in support of their contentions; this in order 'to put a speedy and certain end to the litigation between the parties about a public matter so well calculated to promote and perpetuate discords and feuds'\u2014'and destroy confidence on the local magistracy and demolish their efficiency.'\u00a0 To this end, the statute confers exclusive and final jurisdiction over these election contests upon the Court of First Instance of the province\u00a0 wherein the contested election was held; and maps out a system of procedure, radically different from that prescribed in ordinary actions, and complete in outline from the 'institution' to the 'determination' thereof, and the execution of the judgment whereby the contest is 'determined;' a system, which in our opinion, does not contemplate and by necessary implication denies the right of the trial court to review its judgment and to grant a new trial or enter a new judgment.\"<\/blockquote>See also Navarro <i>vs<\/i>. Veloso (23 Phil. Rep., 625); Topacio <i>vs<\/i>. Paredes (23 Phil. Rep., 238).<br\/><br\/>Such proceedings are quite different from an action for the condemnation of real estate over which the courts have had plenary control from time immemorial.<br\/><br\/>It should be noted, in the second place, that, under the statute relating to proceedings in contested elections, the moment the judgment is entered and the corresponding order to the board issued, it passes out of the hands of that court and into those of the executive branch of the Government.<br\/><br\/>In those cases the judicial and executive branches of the Government seem to be working together for the accomplishment of a single result, that is, the determination of who was duly elected for the particular office under consideration.\u00a0 The province of the judiciary is limited to the determination of the question of which candidate received the highest number of votes cast in that particular election and the issuance of the corresponding order to the proper board.\u00a0 The proceeding is then taken over by the executive branch of the Government, which, from that moment, has exclusive authority to deal therewith.\u00a0\u00a0 One of the reasons leading to the decision in the Liongson case was the fact that the judicial and executive branch of the Government, in contested\u00a0 election proceedings, act together, the one alone up to a certain point, the\u00a0 other acting alone thereafter.\u00a0 The one has no jurisdiction after a certain point; the other has no jurisdiction before that point is reached.\u00a0 In the Liongson case the court said at page 274:<br\/><blockquote>\"Examining more particularly the provisions of the statute touching the determination of election contests, we find that it clearly contemplates the bringing of all the proceedings on the merits of all such contests to an end promptly upon the determination of the contest by the court.\u00a0 If, as a result of the contest, no one of the candidates appears to have been duly elected, the court shall <i>forthwith<\/i> so certify to the Governor-General, who shall order a special election to fill the office or offices in question; if as a result of the contest, the court is of opinion that the canvass of the board of canvassers was incorrect, it clearly becomes the duty of the court, without waiting the end of the term, to issue its mandamus directing the correction of the canvass; and on the other hand, if it appears that the canvass was correct, it is as clearly the duty to decline to issue the mandamus; and in all cases the imperative duty is thereupon imposed upon the clerk of the court to give <i>immediate<\/i> notice of the <i>determination<\/i> of the contest to the Executive Secretary.\u00a0 All this, manifestly, in order that the executive department of the Government may thereupon take such further steps as may be proper and necessary in giving to the election its proper effect, or for the holding of a new election, in the event that the court is of opinion that no person was in fact elected.\u00a0 We think that there can be no doubt these express provisions for what may be described as the immediate execution of the 'determination' of the contest by the court without giving any discretion to the court to stay the execution of its judgment, authorizing and directing the executive officers of the Government to proceed thereafter as if there were no contest pending, clearly, unmistakably, and unequivocally indicate the purpose of the legislator to bring these election contests to an end by the entry of the judgment of the court, without leaving it in the discretion of the court to reopen the contest thereafter.\"<br\/><br\/>In the third place, it will be observed that the Liongson case declares that the courts lose their plenary control over their judgments and decrees, as regards time, only when the party in whose favor it is\u00a0 rendered is entitled to execution \"as of right.\"<\/blockquote>It is important to determine exactly what is meant by this expression, as used in that\u00a0 case, and for that purpose it will be convenient to examine the decision itself.\u00a0 Discussing the rule in relation to criminal cases, the court points out that this plenary control is in the courts \"before the expiration of the period allowed for the taking of appeal, or in the language of the rule we have just laid down, before the prosecution can have execution upon the judgment of conviction 'as of right.'\"\u00a0 Again we said, discussing section 145 of the new Code of Civil Procedure:\u00a0 \"We think that the true limitation as to time within which this power is vested in the courts is the expiration of the period within which a bill of exceptions may be perfected, or in other words, of the period during which, under the provisions of section 144 of the Code, execution may not issue 'except by special order of the court.'\"<br\/><br\/>Again we said, discussing the provisions of Act No. 867, that:\u00a0 \"The time\u00a0 within which this right (the exercise of plenary control by the courts over their decisions) may be exercised in such cases must be held to coincide with the period therein allowed for the perfection of appeals in such cases; or in other words,\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 the period during which execution may not issue 'as of right.'\"<br\/><br\/>We think that these extracts, examined in connection with the opinion itself, justify us in saying that, with reference to the subject under discussion in the Liongson case, the court was of opinion that the phrase \"the time when the prevailing party is entitled to have execution as of right\" is, in general, identical with the phrase \"the time when the prevailing party has lost his right to appeal.\"<br\/><br\/>By express statutory provision or, in certain cases, by special order of the\u00a0 court, execution may issue in favor of the prevailing party, before the expiration of the period allowed for appeal; but it is manifest that the prevailing party, or anyone acquiring an interest in the judgment under him, who procures the execution of the judgment under such circumstances, takes the risk of being obliged to restore and of responding for any loss or damage which results from the reversal of the judgment on appeal.<br\/><br\/>The use of the phrase \"as of right\" in this connection does not mean merely the time when, under the circumstances of the case, he has a right to have execution; for it is to be presumed that when execution is issued by special order of the court he had a right to have it issued.\u00a0 It means, rather, that he has such a right to have execution issue, that he will not be liable to restore in the event\u00a0 of a reversal on appeal; and this right can exist only when the judgment, so far as it appears from the face of the record, is final as a result of the lapse of the time allowed for appeal.\u00a0 A judgment in an action for condemnation does not have this character prior to the expiration of the time to appeal.\u00a0 While, by express provision of the statute, the plaintiff may enter upon the property and begin the proposed improvements thereon immediately after the judgment is entered, he does so at the risk of having the judgment reversed and being obliged to restore possession and to pay the defendant the damages occasioned.\u00a0 In other words, until after the expiration of the time for an appeal the judgment cannot be executed in favor of the plaintiff as of right.\u00a0 Up to that time, therefore, it is, under the Liongson case, subject to the control of the court.\u00a0 For these reasons certiorari will not lie.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

FELIPE DEFENDANT  AND APPELLANT<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">This is an appeal by the defendant, Felipe Banagale, from the judgment of January 26,1912, whereby the Honorable Isidro Paredes, judge, sentenced him to the penalty of death, to be executed in the place and manner prescribed by Act No. 1577, after such judgment should have been reviewed and\u00a0 affirmed by the honorable Supreme Court, to pay an indemnity of P1,000 to the family of the deceased and the costs of the trial.\u00a0 From this judgment the defendant's counsel appealed.<br\/><br\/>On two different occasions prior to the month of July, 1911, Felipe Banagale tried to make love to Alexandra Solis, the wife of Domingo Posada, which couple had for about four years from the date mentioned been Ba\u00f1agale's tenants on shares and lived in a little house situated on the coconut land of their landlord, in the barrio of San Gregorio of the pueblo of San Pablo, Laguna. Alejandra Solis,, however, rejected the advances of her landlord, Banagale, saying to him \"that she was not independent, and did not wish to have trouble.\"\u00a0 Then the defendant, in view of her refusals, threatened her by saying \"that if she did not accept his love, something would happen to them.\"<br\/><br\/>About 10 o'clock on Friday morning, July 21, 1911, Mariano Ilao by\u00a0 order of Felipe Banagale, invited Domingo Posada to look for a horse belonging to the defendant, which he had missed.\u00a0 On this occasion Ilao entered Posada's house unaccompanied, while Ba\u00f1agale remained in the street, in front of the house, waiting for them.\u00a0 Present Posada, provided with a bolo and dressed in a white undershirt, a pair of dark trousers and a buri hat with a coffee colored band, came down from his house, following Mariano Ilao, and in the street they were met by Felipe Banagale.\u00a0 The three men\u00a0 being now together started to range the coconut land in that place in search\u00a0 of the said horse, and shortly afterwards met Maximino Atienza, who also carried a bolo and joined the party.\u00a0 Thereupon all four continued to scour the coconut lands, crossed a river of the barrio of San Joaquin and then another river until finally they arrived at the barrio of San Vicente, where Mariano Ilao, feeling sick and hungry, remained in a small warehouse and his three companions went on, but they had scarcely gone a distance of 30 brazas when Ilao heard cries:\u00a0 \"Spare my life,\" and, believing that the cry had been uttered by the thief in whose possession his three companions had probably found the horse they were looking for, he arose and went toward the place whence the cry proceeded, and upon his arrival within about 9 meters from his companions he saw from where he was that Domingo Posada was lying motionless\u00a0 and prostrate on the ground, apparently dead, while Ba\u00f1agale and Atienza, each with his bolo dyed in blood,\u00a0 were standing on either side of the corpse.\u00a0 Seeing Ilao approach, they called to him by making signals with their bolos, but he was afraid they might kill him, so he ran back home, where he arrived at dusk.<br\/><br\/>On Saturday morning, when the deceased's wife noticed that her husband had not returned home at any time during the preceding night, that of Friday, July 21, she sent word to her father, Mariano Solis, of what had occurred.\u00a0 On the morning of that same day, Saturday, Felipe Banagale appeared at the little house where\u00a0 Alejandra Solis lived and inquired of her whether her husband, Posada, had returned home yet.\u00a0 On the third day, Sunday, Mariano Solis went to the house of his daughter to obtain information\u00a0 relative to the disappearance of her husband.\u00a0 She then told her father that her husband, Posada, had left the house on the previous Friday morning, upon the invitation of Mariano Ilao, to look for a horse that had been lost, and that they both had gone away in company with Felipe Banagale, who\u00a0 returned to the said house on the following Sunday.\u00a0 There he met Mariano Solis, who begged him to assist in searching for Posada, inasmuch as the latter had disappeared in his company on entering his coconut land.<br\/><br\/>One day in the following month of August, the justice of the peace of the pueblo of San Pablo, having received confidential information as to what had occurred, sent for Mariano Ilao and began a preliminary investigation, as a result of which, on the afternoon of the 11th of the said month of August, a skeleton with clothing and a hat was found in the barrio of San Vicente, in the place indicated by Ilao, by some policemen, several residents, the father-in-law\u00a0 of the deceased Posada, and the said justice of the peace.\u00a0 The latter ordered that the bones and wearing apparel found be gathered up, and they were exhibited by the prosecution as the <i>corpus delicti.<\/i><br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, the provincial fiscal, on the 30th of September following, filed an information in the Court of First Instance of Laguna, charging Felipe Ba\u00f1agale with the crime of murder, and, this case having been instituted, the judgment aforementioned was rendered.<br\/><br\/>The facts related show that the unfortunate Domingo Posada met a violent death at the hands of two men who assaulted him with bolos in an uninhabited tract of land planted with coconut trees, and that the only known motive of the\u00a0 assault was because the deceased's faithful wife refused to yield to her landlord, Felipe Ba\u00f1agale, who sought to make her his concubine.\u00a0 These facts constitute only the crime of homicide, punished by article 404 of the Penal Code, for lack of proof that its perpetration had been attended by any of the qualifying\u00a0 circumstances enumerated in article 403 of the same Code, as the record does not show how or in what manner the assault commenced, whether there was trouble or any dispute or quarrel between them, and account must be taken of the fact that the deceased also carried a bolo on that occasion, although this weapon was not afterwards found in the place of the crime.<br\/><br\/>It could not be ascertained in a satisfactory manner whether in the present case there was a conspiracy between the assailants and plain deliberate premeditation for the perpetration of the crime, inasmuch as it is not enough to suspect and to presume the existence of said circumstance, even on the part of the principal supposed to be interested in the death of the husband of the woman courted, but it is necessary that the criminal intent to kill Domingo Posada should have been evident and manifest, and that by prior acts on the part at least of the defendant, Ba\u00f1agale, it should have been clear that the latter, on conceiving the crime, resolved, after mature deliberation and reflection, to carry it into execution and performed acts that demonstrated and decided his criminal purpose.\u00a0 The record does not show whether Banagale, upon extending the invitation to Domingo Posada through Mariano Ilao, did so for the purpose of killing the former, inasmuch as there is no proof that he had resolved upon doing so, through deliberation, meditation, and reflection, and performed acts revealing his criminal purpose, some days or even hours prior to carrying out his criminal determination to kill the unfortunate Posada.\u00a0 Article 10, circumstance 7, of the Penal Code establishes the requisite that the criminal should have acted, in the perpetration of the crime, with deliberate premeditation or that he should have prepared for its commission by outward acts such as denote in the agent a persistent criminal purpose and a meditated resolution to consummate the deed.<br\/><br\/>The commission of the crime may not be deemed to have been attended by the qualifying circumstance of <i>alevosia<\/i> or treachery, inasmuch as no person, other than the two assailants and the\u00a0 deceased, was present at the time, for Mariano Ilao only heard the latter cry out and when he came up within a certain distance to see what had occurred the crime was already consummated, the alleged struggle was over and the victim was lying prostrate and dead on the ground.\u00a0 There is no evidence of record that there was a struggle or fight between the assailants and the assaulted, though there may have been, since the latter also carried a bolo, and, therefore, it may not be held that the crime was attended by any qualifying circumstance such as that of treachery, without decisive and conclusive proof thereof.<br\/><br\/>The guilt of the defendant, Felipe Banagale, is evident and fully proved in this cause, as the perpetrator of the homicide charged (together with Maximino Atienza, who was not included in the case, as he died after the commission of the crime), for, notwithstanding his denial and plea of not guilty, the record shows decisive and conclusive proof of his responsibility and such that produces in the mind, beyond all peradventure, the most complete conviction that the said Banagale, together with the aforementioned Maximino Atienza, took a material part in the assault and killing of Domingo Posada.<br\/><br\/>Indeed, the following facts were duly proved at the trial, to wit, that Domingo Posada left his house on the morning of July 21, 1911, in company with Mariano Ilao,\u00a0 who expressly invited him to do so, and on the way they were joined by the defendant, Ba\u00f1agale, who had been waiting for them in the street, where he was seen by Posada's wife, and the three men together penetrated into the lands planted in coconut trees, until they met the said Maximino Atienza, who also joined the party; that Mariano Ilao, upon responding to the cry he had heard issue from the place where subsequently the remains were found, positively saw, without any doubt whatsoever, that Domingo Posada was lying prostrate on the ground and apparently dead at a distance of about 9 meters away from him, as he did not approach nearer for fear of the two\u00a0 assailants, who made signals to him with their bolos, which were dripping with blood; that the skull and other bones of the deceased, and the clothes he wore on leaving his house, were minutely examined, and the clothes were identified by his widow, Alexandra Solis, and by the latter's\u00a0 father, the\u00a0 deceased's father-in-law, Mariano Solis; and that the autopsy held by two physicians showed that the cuts or fractures in the back of the skull, the left side of the lower jaw, the second vertebra, the first cervical vertebra\u00a0 and in the left collar bone, Were produced by a short pointed instrument and must necessarily have been mortal Wounds and have caused instant death to the victim.<br\/><br\/>When, on August 11, 1911, an order was issued by the justice of the peace of San Pablo for the arrest of Felipe Ba\u00f1agale, as a result of the preliminary investigation made by that official of the facts related, the policemen who went in search of him were unable to find him in his residence, neither was he to be found in the town nor the adjacent barrios, despite the means employed for his arrest, on which\u00a0 occasion the agents of the authorities were accompanied by a son of the defendant, named Paulino.\u00a0 However, about the 28th of August, 1911, Ba\u00f1agale, having heard that a warrant had been issued for his arrest, gave himself up.\u00a0 Later, early in the evening of a date not recorded, but subsequent to the institution of this case and while the same was pending before the Court of First Instance, Mariano Ilao went to a Chinese store in the town of San Pablo to buy some wine and while there Ba\u00f1agale, who was out on bail, approached him, secretly called him aside to a dark place behind the store where he told Ilao that he would give him P500 if, in the hearing of the case against the accused, witness would change or retract the testimony he had given in the justice of the peace court.\u00a0 Thereupon they separated, but Ilao, notwithstanding his promise to the defendant, did not change his previous testimony, as the latter had proposed that he should, but, on the contrary, he persisted therein.<br\/><br\/>The defendant, desirous of knowing in what state of mind he might find the unfortunate wife of his victim, who during all the night of the 21st was awaiting the return of her husband, went to her house to inquire of her whether Domingo Posada had returned home yet, which procedure on defendant's part shows that he knew that the husband of Alexandra Solis had left and was absent from his house, and that the defendant was not unaware of the reason of the absentee's disappearance, for he exhibited no surprise when the woman replied to him that her husband had not yet returned, nor did he inquire of her where he had gone or the reason of his absence, when in fact the disappearance of Domingo Posada ought not to have been entirely a matter of indifference to the defendant, since the deceased was a tenant on shares of the latter.\u00a0 If, on that occasion, Ba\u00f1agale showed no interest whatever in the fate of his tenant on shares, it was because he was one of those who deprived him of his life.<br\/><br\/>From the third day after the crime, on July 23, the date when Mariano Solis, the deceased's father-in-law, learned of the occurrence, and for several days\u00a0 afterwards, the latter engaged in the\u00a0 search for his son-in-law.\u00a0 He was accompanied, among others, by the defendant Ba\u00f1agale who, according to the testimony given by the said Solis, again presented himself at the house of the deceased on the date above mentioned, and after the witness had, in company with the defendant and others, scoured several barrios, Banagale objected to the plan of visiting the barrio of San Vicente, where the body of the deceased was afterwards found, and induced Solis to request certificates from the lieutenants of the barrios of Soledad, Santa Maria, and San Gregorio, where they had been, in order to prove that they had been in the said barrios in search of Posada; and as Solis stated that he was going to report the matter to the authorities with the information that the deceased, on leaving\u00a0 his house, was in the company of Mariano Ilao, Ba\u00f1agale, having heard that statement, told\u00a0 Solis not to include Ilao in that report or denunciation, because he, the witness, already had three certificates issued by barrio lieutenants, and further said that if Solis should inform any person or authority of the facts, he would fight the case by the employment of legal counsel and the expenditure of all the money necessary.<br\/><br\/>Mariano Ilao, brother-in-law of the defendant, who also stood up with him at his marriage, was the only witness who, though not an eyewitness to the assault, testified that upon approaching the place whence the cry had issued he had heard some one begging for mercy and saw, at a distance of about 9 meters away from him, Domingo Posada prostrate and motionless on the ground, and, standing on either side of the latter, the defendant, Ba\u00f1agale, and Maximino Atienza, now deceased, each holding his bolo, the blade of which was apparently covered with blood; and that he did not proceed to the spot where the two latter were standing beside Posada's body,, because, upon their making signals to him with their bolos for him to approach, he was seized with fear lest they might also kill him, wherefore he immediately ran away from the place.\u00a0 This testimony, given with simplicity and voluntarily without subterfuges or evasions, which obscure the details related by a witness, is conclusive and decisive, and worthy, by the truthfulness it reveals, of consideration and credence, and does not appear to have been disproved, notwithstanding the very many and insistent cross-questions which were addressed to the witness, whose said testimony is corroborated by other evidence found in the record relating not only to the points before mentioned, but also to other facts\u00a0 and details, all tending to prove the responsibility of the defendant Ba\u00f1agale.<br\/><br\/>The witness Ilao testified that it was he who, in obedience to the defendant, entered the house of Domingo Posada to invite the latter to go in search of a strayed horse.\u00a0 He also gave a detailed description of the clothes the deceased was then wearing and of his bolo.\u00a0 These particulars were corroborated by the deceased's wife, who, after her husband's remains\u00a0 had been discovered, identified the undershirt, trousers, and hat which the deceased wore when he left his house at Ilao's invitation.\u00a0 She also testified that, on the occasion just mentioned, the defendant Ba\u00f1agale was standing in the street near her house waiting for Posada and Ilao to come down therefrom.<br\/><br\/>The expert examination made of the bones found by the justice of the peace in the place designated by the witness Mariano Ilao, confirms the latter's statements, to wit, that he saw the defendant and the said Atienza standing on either side of Posada's corpse and each holding a bloody bolo, especially since the said bones showed cuts and marks produced by bolos.<br\/><br\/>So the statements and revelations made by the witness Ilao appear to have been fully corroborated at the trial; and it is to be noted that, without exaggerations or the statement of unnecessary details, which obscure the relation of facts, this witness merely testified to what he had seen and simply told the truth without ulterior consideration whatsoever, and that he\u00a0 refused the offer of P500 with which Ba\u00f1agale attempted to corrupt him by inducing him to give false testimony and violate his oath.<br\/><br\/>The record does not reveal a jot of evidence, even circumstantial, that the witness Ilao, in relating the facts and accusing the defendant Banagale, as well as Atienza, acted under any impulse of revenge, hatred, or animosity toward the former, his brother-in-law, nor that he was instigated or moved by anyone to prefer very serious charges against him by perverting the truth as to what occurred and relating facts which did not take place.<br\/><br\/>The fact that, in spite of his intimate acquaintance with Domingo Posada, he did not recognize the voice he heard of the person who cried out begging for mercy, is not an indication of lack of truthfulness in his testimony, since Domingo Posada's cry was uttered in a\u00a0 moment of terror, fright, and horror which must have overwhelmed him upon seeing himself unexpectedly attacked by two men, one of them his landlord Ba\u00f1agale; and the witness Ilao, in testifying that he did not recognize the deceased's voice, though he afterwards saw\u00a0 him lying prostrate on the ground, thereby evidenced good faith and truthfulness on the stand, since he merely testified to what really and actually occurred and did not state that he recognized the voice of the person who uttered the cry, when, in testifying, he could have said that the voice was Domingo Posada's.<br\/><br\/>The defense maintains that the testimony of the witness Mariano Ilao is improbable, relative to his having seen Domingo Posada lying motionless and prostrate on the ground at a distance of 9 meters away from him in a place covered with a considerable growth of tall grass which must have made it impossible to see Posada's body; but the justice of the peace, who visited that place with agents of the authorities, and the witness Ilao, the deceased's father-in-law, and others testified that the said place where the remains of the deceased were found was clear and could be seen from a distance of 9 meters away, as the witness Ilao stated.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the testimony of Alejandra Solis, the deceased's widow, the record discloses no evidence or fact whatever in contradiction thereof.\u00a0 This witness, who was able to walk about the house, though only about 28 days before she had given birth to a child, corroborated the testimony of the witness Ilao, to the effect that her husband left her house in company with Ilao at the latter's invitation, and further testified that on that\u00a0 occasion Banagale was in the street near her house waiting for her husband, and that when the latter had left with Ilao they were joined by the defendant Ba\u00f1agale; it is, therefore, an incontrovertible fact and one duly proved, that when her husband left his house to search for a strayed horse, he was accompanied by Mariano Ilao and by the defendant Ba\u00f1agale.\u00a0 This woman, who, from the beginning, snowed that her only desire and interest had been for the return and appearance of her husband, and notwithstanding the covert threat which the defendant had addressed to her when she rejected his amorous advances, did not manifest any prejudice toward the defendant, for at first she accused Mariano Ilao of having caused the disappearance of her husband, not believing perhaps that her landlord could commit such a heinous crime, and changed and withdrew her accusation against Ilao only when she learned of the truthful revelations which the latter had made to the justice of the peace.\u00a0 After that, convinced of the truth of the facts related by the witness Ilao, she accused the defendant Ba\u00f1agale of the crime.<br\/><br\/>The absence of the defendant, Felipe Ba\u00f1agale, from his house and residence, on the 12th of August, 1911, and following days, owing to his concealing himself and keeping beyond the reach of the officers of the law who, accompanied by his son Paulino, were vainly hunting for him in his two houses and in the town and\u00a0 barrios of San Pablo, constitutes further circumstantial evidence of his guilt and is virtually corroboration of the damaging testimony of Mariano Ilao and the widow of the deceased, for, although he was aware that a warrant for his arrest had been issued by the justice of the peace of the said pueblo (as proven by the written petition presented in his name by the attorney, Jose Agoncillo, on the 15th of August, requesting the justice of the peace to cancel the said warrant, on the ground that it was issued without previous accusation or legal complaint) , the said defendant did not surrender to the authorities until the\u00a0 28th of August, and did so undoubtedly because he feared that he would finally be arrested.\u00a0 An innocent man with a clear conscience, even when aware of the search made for him by the officers of the law, will not conceal himself or evade an investigation of the unlawful acts charged against him, nor will he take any steps whatever to prevent the discovery of the guilty party, as did this defendant by proposing to Mariano Ilao\u00a0 that, in consideration of an offer of P500, he should, in the hearing of the case instituted against Ba\u00f1agale, change or retract his testimony previously given in the justice of the peace court, a proposition which the defendant decided to\u00a0 make to the witness Ilao, because he was aware that the latter was the only person who saw Domingo Posada after death in the coconut grove and, standing on either side of the corpse, the defendant and his co-principal in the crime, Maximino Atienza, and he well knew that the testimony of the witness Ilao would be conclusive and decisive evidence in\u00a0 establishing his guilt.\u00a0 So it was that\u00a0 when the defendant heard Mariano Solis, the deceased's father-in-law, casually say that he would report the matter to the authorities, as during several days of search he had been unable to find Posada either dead or alive, he, Ba\u00f1agale, suggested to Solis that the latter should not include Mariano Ilao in his complaint.\u00a0 This suggestion was boldly made by the defendant, not in the interest and behalf of Ilao, a relative of his by marriage, but undoubtedly because he feared lest Ilao, the only eye witness to the crime, though after its consummation, might tell the truth, as in fact he did.\u00a0 The defendant's conduct undoubtedly amounts to an additional corroboration of the direct' and circumstantial\u00a0 evidence of his participation in the crime under prosecution.<br\/><br\/>The defendant abstained from testifying in this case and maintained silence during the entire trial.\u00a0 He preferred not to explain where and when he separated from Domingo Posada in the morning or the afternoon of July 21, 1911, why he absented himself from his house, concealed himself for many days after it became publicly known in the pueblo of San Pablo that the remains of the deceased had been discovered, did not surrender to the authorities though he knew, through his children and other relatives, that his arrest had been ordered, and only did so when he realized that he would finally be arrested and would then have to appear and answer the charges preferred against him.<br\/><br\/>The testimony of the three witnesses, bearing on the alibi set up by the defendant's counsel to prove that on the day and at the hour the crime was committed Ba\u00f1agale was in the pueblo of Bi\u00f1an, quite a distance from San Pablo, was insufficient to invalidate the direct and circumstantial evidence which clearly showed that on the said 21st of July he was in the pueblo of San Pablo and in the place of the crime and did take part in the perpetration thereof.\u00a0 Besides the conclusive testimony of Mariano Ilao, the victim's widow, Alejandra Solis, positively testified, and in agreement with the former, that Banagale was near her house waiting in the street for Posada and Ilao to come down out of the building, on the morning of the 21st, several hours before the crime; that on the following day, Saturday, the defendant returned\u00a0 to her house to inquire of her, the widow, whether her husband had yet returned, and that on the next day, Sunday, Ba\u00f1agale again appeared at the said house for the same purpose, to wit, to inquire about the return of the unfortunate Posada, whom he, assisted by Maximino\u00a0 Atienza, had killed on the previous Friday morning; that on this last occasion the defendant met the widow's father, Mariano Solis, in the house (a detail corroborated by the latter) and, at Solis's request, accompanied him with others to search in several barrios for Domingo Posada, who not many days before had been killed by the defendant.\u00a0 All that unimpeachable evidence shows that Felipe Ba\u00f1agale was not away in Bi\u00f1an, but was present in the place of the crime.<br\/><br\/>The testimony before referred to, of witnesses, two of whom were relatives of Banagale and the third simply a day laborer in his employ, contains details which raise the presumption that there was collusion; and, therefore, it cannot be considered as sufficient to overcome the force and efficacy of the testimony given by the said witnesses Mariano Ilao, Alejandro Solis, and Mariano Solis, whose statements on the stand were made with a clearness and simplicity which render them credible; indeed, it was owing to the same that the crime in all its details could be reconstructed as it occurred.<br\/><br\/>The testimony of the witnesses Agustin Calabia and Miguel Banatlao, sons-in-law of the defendant, did not avail to disprove the truth of the fact, as averred by the witnesses for the prosecution, that Ba\u00f1agale, on the date aforementioned and in the company of the victim, of Mariano Ilao and Maximino Atienza, went into the coconut grove for the purpose of committing the crime, inasmuch as the said two witnesses, Calabia and Banatlao, merely denied that Ba\u00f1agale was in the company of those men and virtually stated that, on the morning in question, they had seen Posada Atienza, and Ilao walking along together, thus corroborating the statement made by the latter, with no other difference than that, according to Ilao and the widow Solis, Ba\u00f1agale went from Posada's house with those three men, while the aforesaid witnesses for the defense, relatives of the defendant, testified that, though they saw the three men, they did not see Ba\u00f1agale in their company.<br\/><br\/>The trial judge, weighing the evidence adduced by both sides, in accordance with the rules of sound judgment and common sense, held that the defendant Ba\u00f1agale's guilt had been established, and, therefore, it may not now be said that there can be any reasonable doubt of the defendant's participation in the crime, to offset the conviction acquired of his responsibility, as no grounds exist on which may be based an opinion different from that formed by the judge of the lower court, with respect to the credibility of the witnesses for the prosecution.<br\/><br\/>In the commission of the crime, there is to be considered the attendance of the aggravating circumstance of abuse of superior strength and that of the perpetration of the crime in an uninhabited place, in the midst of a field planted in young coco-palms where there were no inhabitants, for, notwithstanding the victim's cry upon being assaulted by his two assailants, no other person, except these three and Mariano Ilao, was aware of the commission of the crime.\u00a0 These aggravating circumstances are not counterbalanced by any extenuating circumstance whatever.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, whereby the errors assigned to the judgment appealed from have been completely refuted, we decide that the crime under prosecution must be classified only as homicide and that, with a reversal of the said judgment, we should and do hereby sentence the defendant Felipe Ba\u00f1agale, as the perpetrator of that crime, to the penalty of twenty years' imprisonment, to the accessories of article 59 of the Penal Code, to\u00a0 pay an indemnity of P1,000 to the widow and heirs of the deceased, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, in view of the nature of the penalty, and to the payment of the costs in both instances.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

In support of this contention he cites some authorities.\u00a0 In case of a desertion from the United States Army, for instance, the deserter may be tried by a court-martial in any jurisdiction in which he may be found.\u00a0 But this authority is conceded to courts-martial upon the theory that the jurisdiction of a court-martial is not limited by territorial bounds. The jurisdiction of the Courts of First Instance of the Philippine Islands, in criminal cases, is limited to certain well-defined territory.\u00a0 They cannot take jurisdiction of persons charged with an offense alleged to have been committed outside of that limited territory.\u00a0 There are well-defined offenses which are <i continuing=\"\"><\/i> or <i>transitory<\/i> offenses.\u00a0 Such offenses are well recognized at common law.\u00a0 (4 Blackstone's Commentaries, 305.)\u00a0 Such offenses may be tried by the court of any jurisdiction in which the defendant may be found. Such offenses are <i>continuing<\/i> or <i>transitory<\/i> upon the theory that there is a continuance or repetition of the offense wherever the defendant may be found.\u00a0 For example, in a case of larceny, if the defendant should commit the crime in one county or state and flee with the property stolen into another county or state, the courts have held that in each new county or state there is a <i>continuance<\/i> of the unlawful taking, and all the essential elements of larceny exist in the new county or state.\u00a0 (Commonwealth <i> vs<\/i>. Uprichard, 3 Gray, Mass., 434; Commonwealth <i>vs<\/i>. White, 123 Mass., 430; Clark's Criminal Law, 366.)<br\/><br\/>While the common law treated certain offenses as <i>transitory<\/i>, as in the case of larceny, many of the States of the Union have regulated it by statute, such statutes expressly authorizing the trial of persons accused of certain offenses, to be tried in any county or state where they may be found with the effects of the larceny.\u00a0 Act No. 518 of the Philippine Commission provides in section 3 that persons who conspire together to form a band of robbers, for the purpose of stealing carabaos or other personal property, by means of force and violence, etc., may be punished therefor in the Court of First Instance of <i>any province<\/i> in which they may be taken or from which they have fled.\u00a0 We find no such provision, however, in Act No. 1980, under which the present defendant is accused.<br\/><br\/>The theory upon which the accused in a continuing or transitory offense may be tried in any jurisdiction in which he is found, is based upon the ground that there is a new commission of the offense in the county or state in which he is found.\u00a0 The complaint presented in such cases does not,\u00a0 like that in the present, allege that the crime was committed in some other county or state, where it was originally committed, but in the county or state where the defendant is found.\u00a0 In the present case it will be noted from reading the complaint copied above, that the same alleges that the offense was committed iri the Province of Cebu.\u00a0 There is no allegation in the complaint that the offense was committed within the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila.\u00a0 The complaint should show that the offense was committed within the jurisdiction of that court A complaint which shows positively that an offense was not committed within the jurisdiction of the court is demurrable.<br\/><br\/>We do not feel called upon at the present time to decide whether the offense of desertion under Act No. 1980 is a continuing offense or not.\u00a0 We simply decide, at the present time, that, inasmuch as there is no allegation in the complaint alleging that the crime with which the defendant is charged was committed within the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, that said court is without jurisdiction to try said offense.\u00a0 The judgment, therefore, of the lower court sustaining the demurrer, is hereby affirmed and it is ordered that the cause be remanded to the lower court whence it came and that an order be issued permitting the plaintiff, within a period of five (lays, to make such amendments in the complaint originally presented, as may be deemed necessary, within the provisions of the law.\u00a0 If, within said period of five days, no amendments are made, then and in that case the judgment heretofore rendered by the Honorable Simplicio del Rosario, judge, shall become final.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Leoquinco, and Nazaria Galvez.\u00a0 This instrument appears also to have been signed by the witness Lorenzo Galvez, below the name and surname of the testator.\u00a0 (p. 3, B. of E., translated into Spanish on p. 5.)<br\/><br\/>Further on in the same record, pages 6 to 7, there appears another will written in Tagalog and executed on the same date by Victor Galvez in presence of the witnesses Cirilo Paguia, Florentino Sison, and Juan Mendoza.<br\/><br\/>In the course of the proceedings various witnesses were examined by the petitioner and by the respondent, Canuta Galvez, the only daughter of the alleged testator, and the attorney Antonio Constantino stated that he waived the right to present evidence and acquiesced in the petition made by Santiago Galvez for the probate of the will, in view of a transaction entered into by the parties; but the court did not accept the compromise, on the ground that it is improper to hold that a will is the faithful expression of the last wishes of a\u00a0 decedent, upon the mere fact of the parties' petitioning to that effect, when such will, as in the case at bar, was assailed at the commencement of the suit.<br\/><br\/>After due trial the judgment aforementioned was rendered, from which an\u00a0 appeal was entered by counsel for the petitioner, Santiago Galvez.<br\/><br\/>This case deals with the probate of the second will executed by Victor Galvez on August 12,1910, and signed in his presence by the witnesses Juan Dimanlig, Nazaria Galvez, and J. Leoquinco, and, as the testator was no longer able to sign on account of his sickness, Lorenzo Galvez, at his request, affixed his own signature to the instrument, for him and below his written name.\u00a0 This will, written in Tagalog and translated into Spanish, is marked as Exhibit B and is found on pages 3 and 5 of the bill of exceptions.<br\/><br\/>The other will, written in Tagalog and marked Exhibit A, was presented during the proceedings; it was the first one the testator executed on the same date, and, for the purpose of correcting an error contained in this first will, he executed another will, the second, which is the one exhibited for probate.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding the opposition by Canuta Galvez, the testator's daughter, who alleged that her father, owing to his very serious sickness with cholera, lacked the intellectual capacity and clear judgment requisite for making a will, and notwithstanding her testimony adduced in corroboration of her brief, the record sufficiently proved the contrary; the subscribing witnesses to the will affirmed under oath that they were present when Victor Galvez, then sick in his house, stated to them that the document read before them by Lorenzo Galvez contained his last will and testament, and that, as the testator was no longer able to sign, he charged his nephew Lorenzo to do so in his stead, which the latter did by affixing his own signature to the document, after having written at the foot of the same the name and surname of the testator, Victor Galvez, who, as these witnesses observed, was of sound mind and in the full enjoyment of his mental faculties; he talked intelligently and with perfect knowledge of what was taking place.\u00a0 They further testified that they all, including the said Lorenzo Galvez, signed the will in the presence of the testator, Victor Galvez, who was at the time lying on his bed.<br\/><br\/>In order to hold that Victor Galvez, on account of serious sickness, was not then of sound mind and did not have full knowledge of his acts and, therefore, waif incapable to execute a will, it is necessary that the proceedings disclose conclusive proof of his mental incapacity and of his evident lack of reason and judgment at the time he executed his will in the presence of the witnesses whose signatures appear at the foot thereof, for these witnesses positively affirmed that Victor Galvez, on executing his will, showed that he was in full possession of his intellectual faculties and was perfectly cognizant of his acts.<br\/><br\/>The physician Dr. Vicente de Jesus, in his testimony, referred to the\u00a0 effects and results of cholera on a patient in ordinary cases and in the regular course of this disease; but his statements, taken in general, cannot, in the present suit, serve as a ground upon which to predicate incapacity, for the reason that he did not examine Victor Galvez, nor did he even see him between the hours of 12 in the morning and 3 in the afternoon of the 12th of August, 1910, during\u00a0 which period the testator ordered his will drawn up and the attesting witnesses signed it, Galvez having died at about 6 o'clock that same afternoon.\u00a0 It may be true that cholera patients do, in the majority of cases, become incapacitated in the manner described by the witnesses; but there may be exceptions to the general rule, and to judge from the testimony of the witnesses who saw and communicated with the patient Victor Galvez at the time he executed his will, his physical and mental condition must have been an exception, since he demonstrated that he had sufficient energy and clear intelligence to execute his last will in accordance with the requirements of the law.<br\/><br\/>Besides the attestation of the aforesaid subscribing witnesses, the contents of the will and the testator's positive determination to rectify the error he incurred in the execution of his first will, show that Victor Galvez was in his sound mind and was perfectly aware of his duties in respect to the legal, inviolable rights of his daughter and sole heir, Canuta Galvez.<br\/><br\/>Inasmuch as, in the drafting and execution of the second will (Exhibit B), signed in the name of the testator by Lorenzo Galvez and the witnesses Juan Dimanlig, Nazaria Galvez, and J. Leoquinco,\u00a0 the formalities prescribed by section 618 of the Code of Civil Procedure were observed, for the testator's name appears written at the foot of the will and under this name Lorenzo Galvez signed by direction of the testator himself, and the instrument was also signed by the attesting witnesses before mentioned who affirmed that they heard and attested the dispositions made by the testator and witnessed the reading of the will, that they were present when the said\u00a0 Lorenzo Galvez signed the will in the name of the testator and that they signed it in the presence of all the persons assembled in the latter's house, the conclusion is inevitable that Victor Galvez, in executing his will, did so with a sound mind and the full use of his mental faculties; therefore, the will must be admitted to probate.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, with a reversal of the judgment appealed from in so far as it denies the probate of the said will,\u00a0 we hereby hold that the same was duly executed by Victor Galvez and expresses his last wishes, and we affirm the rest of the said judgment, with respect to the appointment, as administratrix, of Canuta Galvez, the testator's daughter and sole heir.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

YAP TICO ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>MORELAND, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">The action is one to determine the ownership of certain real property and to secure a permanent injunction restraining the defendants from levying upon and selling or other wise invading the same.<br\/><br\/>There is only one appellant, F. M. Yap Tico.\u00a0 Three questions are\u00a0 raised: one, the sufficiency of the complaint on demurrer; another, the sufficiency of the complaint to sustain the injunction; the third, upon the merits.<br\/><br\/>The ownership and right to possession of the plaintiffs to the property in question is conceded.<br\/><br\/>We regard this case as turning upon the question whether the defendant sheriff had levied upon or announced for sale the <i>corpus<\/i> of the property in litigation herein or whether he had\u00a0 seized upon and was selling merely the right to repurchase which\u00a0 at the time belonged to the judgment debtor, Secundino Mendezona, one of the defendants herein.\u00a0 If he had levied upon and was\u00a0 selling the latter only, an injunction would not lie.\u00a0 If the former, an injunction was proper.<br\/><br\/>The argument of counsel for the appellants is based upon the theory that the sheriff had levied upon and was about to sell only that interest in the premises belonging to Mendezona known as the right of repurchase.\u00a0 In such case the action would not lie and the injunction was, of course, improper.<br\/><br\/>In resolving this question it must be borne in mind that, although there was a trial with the introduction of evidence by both parties, such evidence has not been brought to this court.\u00a0 In deciding this appeal upon the merits we look only to the pleadings and proceedings in the action and to the facts stated in the opinion of the trial court.<br\/><br\/>It is true that the complaint seems to allege in a general way that the sheriff proposed selling the \"right, interest, and share\" which the judgment debtors had in the premises in litigation; but it does not state that that was all that the sheriff had actually seized and levied upon.\u00a0 On the contrary, it affirmatively alleges that the defendants, were actually invading the property, rights and interests of the <i>plaintiffs<\/i>. Moreover, the prayer of the complaint indicates that the <i>corpus<\/i> of the property had actually been seized by the sheriff under the execution, and was being advertised for sale.\u00a0 The prayer is to the effect that the court \"issue a preliminary injunction against all of the defendants and each of them, their agents, servants, lawyers, and other persons, requiring them to abstain from selling, taking possession of, or seizing any of the property described in the complaint until after final judgment in this case.\"\u00a0 While the prayer is not strictly an allegation of the complaint, it may, nevertheless, be used to make clear an allegation which might, rigidly speaking, be susceptible of different interpretations.<br\/><br\/>As we have said, the defendants failed to bring here the levy and return of the sheriff, which are primarily the best evidence of the nature and extent of the levy, and failed also to present on appeal the notice of sale published by the sheriff.\u00a0 We have, however, in addition to the finding of the court below, the answer of the sheriff in this case.\u00a0 In the absence of the evidence referred to, and, in fact, any other evidence in the case, we must take this answer, together with the finding of the court on the subject, as conclusive of the question as to what property was the subject of the levy and the proposed sale.<br\/><br\/>That answer, so far as material to this question, reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"The undersigned appears\u00a0 and respectfully represents:<br\/><br\/>\"1. That he is sheriff\u00a0 of the Province of\u00a0 Nueva Ecija and one of the defendants in the above-entitled action.<br\/><br\/>\"2. That in attempting to sell, as sheriff, the property described in the second\u00a0 paragraph of the complaint, he was\u00a0 doing so by virtue of the executions issued on the 24th of November, 1906, by the Honorable Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, or, in other words, he was engaged in the performance of his duties as sheriff.\"<\/blockquote>Paragraph 2 of the complaint describes the property as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"A warehouse of strong materials located on land situated in the\u00a0 pueblo of Cabanatuan of the Province of Nueva Ecija and leased to Dona Ruperta Garcia, which warehouse measures\u00a0 26 feet in length and 65 feet in width, with a wing 52 feet in length and 39 feet in width; a steam engine of 35 nominal English horsepower; 6 mills; 4 sifters; 7 elevators; 3 ventilating cones and complete accessories for threshing paddy and bleaching and polishing rice with a capacity of 1,500 sacks daily, installed in the said warehouse, as well as a locomotive of 15 American horsepower; a threshing machine with a capacity of 1,000 <i>cavanes<\/i> of paddy daily; and 75 carts with iron axles and wheels.\"<\/blockquote>This property, as is readily seen, is not the interest known as the right of repurchase, but is the property, and the whole thereof, which was purchased by the plaintiffs in this action from Mendezona and his partners and as to which said Mendezona reserved only the right of repurchase.<br\/><br\/>This admission of the sheriff that he had levied upon the <i>corpus<\/i> of the property and was attempting to sell it is of importance in this action for the reason that he is the person who knew best the nature of the levy and the property that he had actually seized.\u00a0 We regard this answer as substantially taking the place of the sheriffs levy and return and the published notice of sale, as it shows the property levied upon and exposed for sale as fully as the levy and return would do.<br\/><br\/>It is conceded in this case that the plaintiffs had a right to the possession and control of this property\u00a0 and that the sheriff had no right to interfere therewith.\u00a0 It is also conceded that the sheriff had no right to levy upon anything concerning said property except Mendezona's right to repurchase the same, leaving the plaintiffs in the possession and control of the <i>corpus<\/i> and permitting them to continue the business in which they were then engaged thereon.\u00a0 Such being the case, a seizure of and levy upon said property itself was an unwarranted invasion of the rights and interests of the plaintiffs; and an attempt to sell the property under said levy could be enjoined in the proper action.<br\/><br\/>It may be true that the terms of the injunction were somewhat broader than the prayer of the complaint.\u00a0 If so, a motion should have been made to vacate the injunction, or such part of it as wa in excess of the remedy demanded.\u00a0 In such case the execution creditor would have been at liberty to levy upon the right of repurchase\u00a0 and proceed with its sale.\u00a0 The only objection made, however, was directed against the sufficiency\u00a0 of the complaint as a basis for any injunction whatever.\u00a0 Such objection, in the form of a demurrer, was not made, however, until the 29th of April, 1907, when the demurrer was filed; while the answer of the sheriff above referred to, showing the nature of the levy, was filed on the 12th of March, 1907.<br\/><br\/>While the complaint, from the viewpoint of the draftsman is not well drawn, and while criticism of it in incidental particulars is easy, still the broad question is, Does it fairly apprise the defendants of the plaintiff's real contentions and claims against them? Would they be misled to their surprise and\u00a0 injury if they\u00a0 placed faith in its allegations? (Code of Civ. Proc, sec. 06.)<br\/><br\/>Paragraph 7 of the complaint, so much relied upon by those attacking the validity of the judgment below, does not allege what property was actually seized, or in what manner the execution had been levied, or <i>what methods were being used to carry the levy and sale to completion.<\/i> It simply states that the sheriff was <i>offering for sale<\/i> certain interests of the defendants.\u00a0 This would, of\u00a0 course, indicate that those interests were the only property levied upon. But it does <i>not<\/i> indicate what property had actually been seized, or taken possession of, or invaded, in order to make such levy and sale.\u00a0 It may well be, and it seems to be, the intention and purpose of paragraph 8 of the complaint to allege that, in order to sell the right to repurchase plaintiff's property, the sheriff <i>had gone upon and taken possession of the property itself,<\/i> or, at least, was attempting to do so. It would not be at all surprising if the\u00a0 sheriff\", attempting to levy upon such an indefinite thing as a right to repurchase, should deem it necessary for a valid levy, to take possession of or otherwise invade the\u00a0 property to which that right pertained.\u00a0 Construing paragraphs 7 and 8 together, and considering them in conjunction with the prayer for relief, one is forced to the conclusion that objection is made not only to the notice of sale, but also to what had\u00a0 been done to carry the proposed sale to completion.\u00a0 It is reasonably clear that the plaintiffs were complaining to defendants that they were actually invading the plaintiff's property.\u00a0 It matters not whether that invasion was for the purpose of selling the <i>corpus<\/i> of the property, or whether it had as its object merely the sale of the right to repurchase.\u00a0 It was an invasion in either event.\u00a0 Seizing one man's property for the purpose of selling that of another is, in principle, as illegal and indefensible as it is to seize and sell one man's property to pay the debt of another.\u00a0 <i>Selling<\/i> property is not the only way of committing trespass upon it.<br\/><br\/>For these reasons we believe that the demurrer was properly overruled.<br\/><br\/>But, granting all that may be said about the deficiency of the complaint, still it is not more deficient than the demurrer urged against it.\u00a0 Strictly speaking, the demurrer to the complaint in this case is valueless as a pleading, in that it fails in one of the essential requirements of a demurrer.\u00a0 Section 91 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"The demurrer must distinctly specify the grounds upon which any of the objections to the complaint, or to any the causes of action therein stated, are taken.\"<\/blockquote>When a demurrer is made to a complaint, whether upon one ground or another, it should set out distinctly the grounds upon which the objection is based.\u00a0 It cannot be couched simply in the language of the code.\u00a0 It must set forth distinctly the grounds upon which that language is founded.\u00a0 The reason for this is plain.\u00a0 It is not fair to the plaintiff to interpose to a complaint the simple objection that it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.\u00a0 Neither is it fair to the court.\u00a0 Neither the plaintiff nor the\u00a0 court should be left to make, possibly, a long and tiresome examination and investigation and then, perhaps, finally be compelled to guess.\u00a0 The grounds of the objection should be pointed out so that all may see.\u00a0 A demurrer was not invented to make useless work for a court, or to deceive or delude a plaintiff.\u00a0 Its purpose was to clarify all ambiguities; to make certain all indefinite assertions; to bring the plaintiff to a clear and clean expression of the precise grievance which he has against the defendant; to aid in arriving at a real issue between the parties; to promote understanding and prevent surprise.\u00a0 To that end, a demurrer should specify, for the benefit of the plaintiff and the court as well, the very weakness which the demurrant believes he sees tn the complaint.\u00a0 It should be so presented and handled as to bring to a quick determination the question whether the plaintiff has, at bottom, a legal claim against the defendant.\u00a0 To attain this object, the demurrer should be clear, specific, definite, and certain as to the precise weakness of the complaint.\u00a0 Being an instrument to cure imperfections, it should not itself be imperfect.<br\/><br\/>To the, complaint before us a demurrer was interposed, stating merely that the complaint did not allege facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.\u00a0 No particular ground was specified. No specific failure was asserted or named.\u00a0 No precise weakness was pointed out.\u00a0 The order overruling the demurrer does not indicate that the court was informed as to the specific grounds upon which it was based.\u00a0 Certainly, so far as the record goes, the plaintiffs never knew until after the demurrer was decided precisely what the defendant was driving at when he presented it.<br\/><br\/>Under such conditions, we do not feel that we should use our discretion to indulge presumptions in favor of the demurrant in determining whether or not the allegations of the complaint are sufficient.\u00a0 We do not feel like going out of the beaten path, even\u00a0 if we could, to search for defects in the complaint when neither the plaintiff nor the court was precisely informed of the alleged defects until it was too late to be of use to either. We do not feel like favoring a demurrer which is as full of defects as the pleading against which it is launched.\u00a0 The order of the court overruling the demurrer should be sustained if there is any legal ground upon which it can be, although such ground was not presented by the court below as one of the reasons for its decision.\u00a0 The fact that the demurrer was worthless as a pleading is one of the strongest reasons for overruling it.<br\/><br\/>It has been urged that\u00a0 our decision, requiring that in all demurrers the <i>specific grounds<\/i> of the <i>particular objection<\/i> should be set out distinctly, is against the weight\u00a0 of authority.\u00a0 We do not think so.\u00a0 But if it were, we should still be forced, in conscience, to stand upon the proposition as we have stated it, as it seems to us to be fundamentally right and to be fully supported by reason and logic.<br\/><br\/>In an examination of the authorities which have been urged against the proposition here taken, we have found only one State which has been shown, to our satisfaction, to have taken a position opposed to ours.\u00a0 The courts of the State of New York have been cited\u00a0 against us and one of the latest decisions presented in support thereof.\u00a0 An actual reading of the New York Code of Civil Procedure demonstrates that the case is not well cited.\u00a0 The New York Code of Civil Procedure provides expressly that a demurrer, based upon the ground that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, may be presented in those words, which are the words of the statute; and no specific grounds of such objection need be given.\u00a0 Instead, then, of requiring the specific grounds upon which the objection is based to be distinctly stated, as does our statute, the New York statute provides expressly that they need not\u00a0 be\u00a0 given.\u00a0 Therefore, the\u00a0 contention that the decisions of New York are opposed to our decision seems to be unfounded.\u00a0 As a necessary result, the claim that New York is not in accord with this decision is also unfounded.\u00a0 Most of the decisions\u00a0 presented from other States, such as those of Indiana, North Dakota, and Missouri, are based, so far as can be ascertained with the material at hand, upon statutes materially different from our own, and for that reason are not in point.<br\/><br\/>As highly as we respect the learning and ability of the supreme courts of the States holding contrary views, if there is more than one, we cannot accept their judgment as to the construction which should be given to section 91 of our Code of Civil Procedure.\u00a0 To our mind, that section clearly requires two things to be done by the demurrant:\u00a0 (1) He shall make an objection, putting such <i>objection<\/i> in the words of the statute, or substantially in those words; and (2) he shall specify the <i>grounds<\/i> of that objection.\u00a0 The construction given by that section by those who oppose that here set forth requires only <i>one<\/i> of those things to be done,namely, the making of the <i>objection<\/i> in the words\u00a0 of the statute.\u00a0 This construction leaves the other part of the statute, namely, that requiring that the <i>grounds<\/i> of the objection shall also be specified, without force and effect.\u00a0 Thus, by what appears to be construction, a very important, in fact the most important, part of the law has been abrogated.\u00a0 As for us, we do not construe or interpret this law. It does not need it.\u00a0 We <i>apply<\/i> it. By applying the law, we conserve both provisions for the benefit of litigants.\u00a0 The first and fundamental duty of courts, in our judgment, is to <i>apply<\/i> the law.\u00a0 Construction and interpretation come only after it has been demonstrated that application is impossible or inadequate without them.\u00a0 They are the very last functions which a court should exercise.\u00a0 The majority of the laws need no interpretation or construction.\u00a0 They require only application, and if there were more application and less construction, there would be more stability in the law, and more people would know what the law is.<br\/><br\/>Some authorities still adhere to the technicalities of the old pleading and procedure in spite of the liberal tendency of procedural laws.\u00a0 They still cling to the old difference between general and special demurrers, holding with the old authorities that in special demurrers the precise defect must be pointed out, while in a general demurrer no defect whatever need be specified.\u00a0 This is distinctly against the tendency of modern thought and modern legislation.\u00a0 The more general a demurrer is, the worse it is. The assertion that a special demurrer, which under the old practice was used only against form, should specify the particular defect, while the general demurrer, which under the old practice was used only as to substance, should specify none, does not appeal to us.\u00a0 The claim that, in an objection to the form, one must aim exactly at the defect; whereas, in an objection to the substance, he\u00a0 may aim at the sky, is not convincing.\u00a0 As we view it, it is not logical to maintain that, as to form, which, as a rule, is of slight importance, the party must be fully advised and informed of the alleged defect, and to that end the demurrant must point it out specially; while as to the\u00a0 substance, which, at all times, is the important thing of all, the party need not be advised or informed as to the precise defect alleged, and that, therefore, the demurrant need not point it out but is fully justified in keeping, so far as he can, both the court and the party in complete ignorance thereof.<br\/><br\/>It is claimed, following the old theory, that the general demurrer\u00a0 searches the whole record; but if it searches, it does not discover or disclose.\u00a0 It may search, but if it finds anything, it puts it carefully away in a dark place, cautiously concealing it from the eyes of the court and the knowledge of the adversary.\u00a0 The reason\u00a0 for this is that, if the court or the party knew the precise defect that had been \"searched' there would be an immediate amendment.\u00a0 If the party against whom a demurrer is interposed can be kept from discovering the real defect in his pleading until he is deeply in\u00a0 the meshes of demurrant's net, then the case many times is substantially won.\u00a0 He cannot escape except by loss of so much time and at so great expense that, many times, it is not worth while to recommence or continue his action.<br\/><br\/>It has been the policy of modern legislation to do away with these objectionable features, as well as others, and to that end the general demurrer has been, in effect, abolished in a number of States.\u00a0 Our own statute requires that \"the demurrer must distinctly specify the grounds upon which <i>any<\/i> of the objections to the complaint, or to any of the causes of action therein stated, are taken.<br\/><br\/>A pleading is not an instrument of deception.\u00a0 It is not something to get parties into trouble.\u00a0 It is not to be used to dig pitfalls\u00a0 or to lay traps or snares.\u00a0 It is not to be used to deceive but to inform; not to befog but to clarify; not to cause trouble but to obviate it; not to make expense but\" to save it.\u00a0 A demurrer, for example, should not leave the court and the party against whose pleading it is aimed as ignorant of the defect in the offending pleading as before the demurrer is filed.\u00a0 Many times the objection that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action means very little.\u00a0 There are occasions, of course, when it is sufficient. But it is certain that no injury can ever result from naming the <i>precise reason<\/i> why the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action; and, in\u00a0 the great majority of cases, great good will come of it Take this very case.\u00a0 Much of the real difficulty and uncertainty would have been avoided if the demurrer had pointed out the precise defect which it was claimed was found in the complaint.\u00a0 If the demurrer had specified arid stated that the complaint was defective, if it were really so defective, in that it alleged that the defendant had levied simply upon the interest of Mendezona in the premises known as the right to repurchase, something which he had a right to do\u00a0 and upon which no cause of action could be predicated, then the plaintiff would have been given a fair opportunity to meet the objection, either by amending his complaint and alleging a levy by\u00a0 the defendant upon the <i>corpus<\/i> of the property, or by standing upon the complaint and submitting to the court the question of law whether the defendant had a right to levy upon the right of repurchase.\u00a0 If the plaintiff had amended by alleging a levy upon the <i>corpus<\/i>, then the demurrer and all the questions relating thereto, now vexing the parties, would have been out of the case.\u00a0 If the plaintiff really intended to allege just what the demurrant now claims that he did allege, then the question of law above referred to would have been clearly presented and the case entirely resolved by the decision of that question.\u00a0 Indeed,\u00a0 it is more than probable that the plaintiff, if his complaint was really defective, would have withdrawn it after full consideration of the objection urged against it.<br\/><br\/>It is not to be taken, from what we have said, that we will, of our own motion, raise the question of the sufficiency of a demurrer.\u00a0 We treat it as we do every other pleading.\u00a0 If the parties do not make timely objection to the defect, it win be deemed to have been waived.\u00a0 We take cognizance of the defect only when it has been duly and, properly raised below or when, as in this case, it is necessary to sustain a judgment of the inferior court.<br\/><br\/>It must be remembered that, although, according to the record, there was a formal trial, with the introduction of testimony by both parties, the evidence has not been brought up on this appeal and we are, therefore, limited to the facts stated in the opinion of the trial court, together with the pleadings and proceedings\u00a0 in the\u00a0 action, in determining whether the judgment should be affirmed or reversed.\u00a0 The trial court, in its decision, finds as a fact that, \"by virtue of two executions issued out of the Court of First Instance of Manila against the property of Secundino Mendezona, the sheriff of Nueva Ecija announced for public sale the property described in paragraph 2 of the complaint.\"\u00a0 The property there described is concededly the property of the plaintiff.\u00a0 This finding is, of course, fatal to appellant's contention that only the right to repurchase was levied upon.\u00a0 We must assume this finding to be based upon the evidence, as none of it is here from which we may determine otherwise.<br\/><br\/>Having these things in mind, we consider the place which a demurrer, as a pleading, occupies in our practice.<br\/><br\/>In this jurisdiction, the results flowing from the interposition\u00a0 of a demurrer, as a pleading, lack some of the features which pertain to such interposition in other jurisdictions.\u00a0 It has been uniformly held by this court that an order overruling a demurrer is not separately appealable, for the reason that it is <i>interlocutory in its nature<\/i> and falls within the prohibition of section 123 of the Code of Civil Procedure. (Segovia <i>vs<\/i>. Prov. Board of Albay, 13 Phil. Rep., 331; Averia <i>vs<\/i>. Reboldera, 10 Phil. Rep., 316; Serrano <i>vs<\/i>. Serrano, 9\u00a0 Phil. Rep., 142.)\u00a0 There are two cases only in which proceedings based upon demurrers are appealable, and then only after final judgments have been entered, terminating definitely\u00a0 the action in that court.\u00a0 One case is where a demurrer to a complaint is sustained, the plaintiff refuses to amend and final judgment dismissing the complaint is entered.\u00a0 This is, however, in one sense, an appeal from a final judgment and\u00a0 not from an order.\u00a0 The other is where a demurrer is\u00a0 overruled, the defendant declines to answer and a judgment in favor of the plaintiff is entered upon the evidence thereupon offered to\u00a0 establish the allegations of the complaint.\u00a0 Even this case may partake much of the nature of an appeal from a judgment on the merits. In every other case, except, of course, where a demurrer is made to an answer, to a cross complaint, or to a counterclaim, in which substantially the same proceedings are had as are described above relative to a demurrer to the original complaint, the order overruling the demurrer and the exception taken thereto are brought to this court, not separately, but along with and as a part of the appeal from the final judgment after trial.\u00a0 In such appeal, if no objection has been made to the introduction of plaintiff's evidence, the case is here considered <i>upon the merits<\/i>, and, even though it clearly appears that the complaint was and is still fatally defective, the demurrer thereto is of no consequence in the decision of the appeal, provided the evidence presented by the plaintiff, received without objection, has cured the defect and established a cause of action.\u00a0 This court, under such circumstances, has never reversed a case based upon the fact that the demurrer was, in the first instance, well founded. On the contrary, the appeal has always been, and is now, decided upon the merits as presented by the evidence, and, if the evidence establishes a cause of action, the judgment is affirmed, no matter how defective the complaint may have been.<br\/><br\/>The reason for this practice is not far away:\u00a0 To prevent the multiplication of appeals, to secure the speedy termination of litigation, and to save expense to litigants.<br\/><br\/>It may be urged that, where the complaint fails to state a cause of action against a defendant, an appeal from an order overruling the demurrer should be permitted in order that he may not be forced to undergo the expense, trouble, and worry of a trial when nothing has been alleged against him.\u00a0 This contention, however, overlooks two very important considerations, aside from the insurmountable one that the Code of Civil Procedure prohibits it.\u00a0 One of them is, \"Who is to determine whether 6r not the complaint <i>does<\/i> state a cause of action?\"\u00a0 The answer to that question presents the other consideration, namely, that the decision of the court upon the demurrer holds that the complaint <i>does<\/i> state a cause of action.\u00a0 Now, the strong probabilities are that the decision is\u00a0 right.\u00a0 The chances are strongly against the defendant in his appeal from that decision.\u00a0 Why, then, should the plaintiff be put to the expense of an extra appeal when he has the judgment of a court in his favor, and when, for that reason, the probabilities are in favor of the proposition that the defendant is wrong in his pleading?\u00a0 To the contention that the defendant ought not to be pressed to trial if he is right is interposed the reply that the plaintiff ought not to be pressed\u00a0 to an appeal if <i>he<\/i> is right.\u00a0 The\u00a0 question is, \"Who is right?\"\u00a0 The only answer to that question is, \"The plaintiff \"\u00a0 It is always the one against whom the judgment of the court runs who is the appellant, and it is always he against whom all the presumptions are indulged.\u00a0 He cannot be permitted, therefore, to play\u00a0 his one chance of reversal against plaintiff's nine chances of affirmance, and thereby cause the plaintiff the expense, trouble, and worry of an appeal.\u00a0 It proves nothing to say that the defendant may be right in interposing his demurrer.\u00a0 The plaintiff may be right also.\u00a0 Having already a judgment in his favor, he has more chances of being right than the defendant.<br\/><br\/>Moreover, if the demurrer alone cannot be made the basis of an appeal, why should it be made the sole reason for a reversal in an appeal taken from a judgment on the merits?<br\/><br\/>It may be asked what, then, is the protection which a demurrer\u00a0 affords a pleader?\u00a0 There are several.\u00a0 In the first place, if a demurrer is well founded, an amendment, generally speaking, immediately results or the action is withdrawn or is dismissed, and the demurrer has accomplished a real purpose.\u00a0 In the second place, if the demurrer is overruled, the pleader, if he has sufficient faith, may still stand upon it, with or without answering, and, upon the proof of plaintiff's cause of action if there is no answer, or upon the trial if there is an answer, object to the introduction of any testimony which tends to surprise him in that it is not within the scope of the allegations of the complaint.\u00a0 Whatever testimony offered is, in reality, subject to objection must be rejected.\u00a0 This will prevent surprise and protect the demurrant from the establishment of a cause of action of which he was not apprised by the allegations of the complaint.\u00a0 Moreover, when the case has reached this point the trial court is given an opportunity to use its sound discretion relative to the allowance of amendments of the defective pleading, of giving time to the other party to procure witnesses to meet the purpose of the amendments, and of doing all those things necessary to dispose of the case according to the right and prevent an error or mistake from causing a miscarriage of justice.<br\/><br\/>It is apparent in this case that the complaint, if defective, was cured by the evidence introduced on the trial, as shown by the finding of the court, presumably based on the evidence, that the sheriff had levied upon the <i>corpus<\/i> of the property which concededly belonged to the plaintiff.\u00a0 The appeal must, therefore, be decided upon the merits.\u00a0 We are of the opinion that a sufficient case has not been made for reversal.<br\/><br\/>Much objection has been made to that branch of our decision which provides that, under the Code of Civil Procedure, the introduction of evidence upon the trial, without objection on the part of the defendant, which\u00a0 establishes a cause of action against the defendant, will prevent him from thereafter raising the question that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, as well as from taking advantage of an equivalent objection made before the trial.\u00a0 Cases are cited to the effect that \"such a defect is not cured by verdict and judgment, even in the absence of any\u00a0 objection by demurrer or answer in the lower court, and objection made on account thereof may be made at any time;\" and that \"pleadings which wholly and completely fail to state any cause of action or defense, so that the admitted allegations cannot be assumed to have been proved, is not cured by verdict.<br\/><br\/>It must be observed, however, that we are not asserting that a cure of the complaint is brought about by a verdict or a judgment. Our contention is that the cure is brought about by defendant's own act.\u00a0 An issue may be joined as well at the trial as before.\u00a0 The\u00a0 reason why issues are required by law to be joined before trial is to give all the parties due notice of the claims made against them, thereby offering full and fair opportunity to produce their witnesses and meet the charges against them. But, where the issue, by some defect in the complaint or answer, has not really been joined before the trial, the parties may, by mutual consent, join issue at the trial.\u00a0 Issues may be raised between the parties in other ways than by pleadings.\u00a0 They may be raised on the trial by the evidence of the parties.\u00a0 However defective the complaint may be, if the parties go to trial, and, without objection from the defendant, the plaintiff proves facts sufficient to constitute the particular cause of action which it was intended his complaint should allege and the defendant voluntarily produces his witnesses to meet the cause of action thus proved, there is then and there joined an issue as fully and effectively as if it had been joined long before by the most perfect pleadings.\u00a0 As we have already said, the purpose of pleadings is to notify the parties of the claims which each has against the other and what each expects to prove.\u00a0 This is in order that each may have a fair opportunity to rebut the evidence of the other by the production of witnesses of his own. If each can be informed of the claims and demands of the other and can have a fair opportunity to produce his evidence in relation thereto, then the object of pleadings has\u00a0 been subserved.\u00a0 When, therefore, upon the trial the plaintiff, by his own proof, tenders the issue which the complaint was intended to tender, and the defendant accepts it and presents his evidence in relation thereto, is it not unreasonable to say that, thereafter, the defendant may, nevertheless, successfully move to dismiss the whole matter for the reason that the <i>complaint<\/i> did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action?\u00a0 If necessary, may not the complaint be amended to meet the situation? (Code Civ. Proc, \u00a7\u00a7 107, 109, 110.)<br\/><br\/>It has also been urged that the sufficiency of the demurrer under the law was not raised at any time by anyone.\u00a0 It is asserted that the plaintiffs always accepted the demurrer as sufficient, and that this court, upon its own motion, has taken up the question of its sufficiency without either of the parties having been heard upon it.<br\/><br\/>While this objection has been fully answered before, we may here add that we do not regard this objection as sound either in fact or in law.\u00a0 The judgment of the court below is entitled to be upheld upon any legal ground, and it is of no consequence whether the court assigned that\u00a0 ground as a basis for its judgment or not.\u00a0 It could very well have dismissed the demurrer upon the sole ground that it was insufficient in law and that the court would not be moved to exercise its power by a pleading which itself did not comply with the law.\u00a0 All this court has done in this connection, therefore, if anything, is to add one more ground to the support of the decision of the lower court.<br\/><br\/>We are of the opinion that the judgment of the court below overruling the demurrer was, under all the conditions, proper, even though the complaint were as defective as is now contended. (<i>See<\/i> 31 Cyc, pp. 317,813, and cases cited.)<br\/><br\/>The judgment is accordingly affirmed, without special finding as to costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa<\/i>, and <i>Johnson, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><br\/><br\/><hr align=\"CENTER\" noshade=\"NOSHADE\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">DISSENTING<\/span><br\/><\/div><br\/><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">TRENT, J., <\/span><br\/><br\/>I dissent.<br\/><br\/>The important question\u00a0 in this case is whether the complaint constitutes a cause of action.\u00a0 It sets out in great detail that plaintiffs, by a number of transactions, became the owners of the property, subject only to the right of repurchase within a given period.\u00a0 A single paragraph (No. 7), however, is devoted to the nature of the levy made by the sheriff.\u00a0 It reads as follows: <br\/><blockquote>\"By virtue of two executions issued by the Court of First Instance of Manila in cases Nos. 4596 and 4597, in which two cases J. M. Yap-Tico is the plaintiff and Secundino Mendezona and Exequiel Pardo are defendants in the first, and in the second Secundino Mendezona is defendant, the sale at public auction has been announced by the sheriff of Nueva Ecija for the 11th day of March, 1907, of all the rights, interest and participation which said\u00a0 Secundino Mendezona and Exequiel Pardo have or may have in the property which I have mentioned in the second paragraph of this complaint, which property belongs to Lizarraga Hermanos.\u00a0 The two executions represent approximately eleven thousand pesos, Philippine currency.\"<\/blockquote>If paragraph 7 is to be believed, it was the intention of the sheriff to dispose of the right, title, and participation of the judgment debtors in the property mentioned \"in the second paragraph of the complaint, which property belongs to Lizarraga Hermanos.\"\u00a0 The statement that the property in question belongs to Lizarraga Hermanos was true in the qualified sense that it was subject to the right of redemption, and such could have been the only meaning intended to be conveyed by this statement in paragraph 7, in view of the express admission in paragraph 2 of the same complaint, that the property was subject to <i>pacto de retro<\/i> which expires December 31, 1907.\"\u00a0 The majority opinion disposes of the allegations contained in paragraph 7 by saying that the complaint \"seems to allege in a general way that the sheriff proposed selling the 'right, interest, and share' which the judgment debtors had in the premises in litigation.\"\u00a0 There can hardly be any argument as to the signification of paragraph 7 read in connection with the,preceding paragraphs of the complaint. All of the first seven paragraphs taken together simply set out that the judgment debtors\u00a0 sold certain specified property upon a <i>pacto de retro<\/i> agreement, and that the sheriff had advertised the sale of the \"rights, interest, and participation\" of the said judgment debtors.\u00a0 But the majority opinion further states as an argument in favor of its theory that the corpus was included in the sheriff's levy that the complaint \"does not state that that was all that the sheriff actually seized and levied upon.\"\u00a0 This holding in effect permits a plaintiff to take advantage of all matters which he does not specifically exclude from his complaint.\u00a0 <i>E converso<\/i>, it could be said under this ruling, that the plaintiff must specifically exclude all matters which he does not wish to include in his complaint.\u00a0 If any principle of construction would apply to the language used in paragraph 7, wherein it is alleged that the sheriff proposed to sell all of the \"right, interest, and participation\" of the judgment debtors in the property in question, it is that of <i>expressio unius est exclusio alterius<\/i>, and that, therefore, the <i>corpus<\/i> of the property was not included in the description.\u00a0 As to the prayer of the complaint:<br\/><blockquote>\"The court is asked<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"2.

Let us say that the <i>corpus<\/i> is described and set forth in the\u00a0 complaint; in the\u00a0 same paragraph (No. 2) is set forth the right to\u00a0 repurchase.\u00a0 Here, then, are two kinds, of property described in the complaint\u2014paragraph 7 states that only the right, interest, and participation of the judgment debtors \"in the property which I have mentioned in the second paragraph of the complaint\" is to be sold.\u00a0 According to the second paragraph, the only interest which they have in the property is the right to repurchase.\u00a0 Notwithstanding this fact, the language of paragraph 7 must be construed to mean the <i>corpus<\/i> of the said property in order to sustain the position of the court.\u00a0 This, in my opinion, furnishes to a plaintiff, who had neither, both a right of action and a cause of action.\u00a0 The only logical construction to be placed upon paragraph 7 is that there is therein alleged only the sale of the \"rights, interest, and participation\" of the judgment debtors in the property.\u00a0 Furthermore, the prayer for relief is no part of the cause of action. It is the legal consequence of the cause of action from the plaintiff's viewpoint, and derives all its force and effect from the cause of action.\u00a0 It is the operation of the cause of action and not the action itself, or any part of it.<br\/><br\/>But the principal reliance of the court is on the answer of the sheriff.\u00a0 It is quite true that admissions in the answer cure defects in the complaint.\u00a0 But the answer of the sheriff was unnecessary.\u00a0 It could serve no useful purpose in the pleadings, and the relief asked for by him (that he be relieved from all responsibility in the matter) could not have been granted without impairing the strength of the injunction.\u00a0 The relief asked for well illustrates the vagueness and ambiguity of the answer.\u00a0 He had incurred no responsibility except that of obeying the injunction,\u00a0 yet he asks to be relieved from all responsibility, which obviously could not have been granted. In fact, the answer of the sheriff was never taken into consideration at all by the lower court.\u00a0 Again, as to the property described in the second paragraph of the complaint, which the sheriff in his answer states he was attempting to sell.\u00a0 There are, as stated above, two kinds of property rights referred to in that paragraph, That part of the paragraph not quoted in the majority opinion reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"By said writing Don Secundino Mendezona sold the property described to the plaintiff for the sum of P25,000 Philippine currency <i>with the right to repurchase, which expires December 31, 1907.<\/i><br\/><br\/>Here, other property than the <i>corpus<\/i> is described.\u00a0 To which did the sheriff refer? Here are two constructions equally applicable to the language used.\u00a0 The adoption of the one (adopted by the court) not only protects the plaintiffs in their rights but effectually prevents the defendants from exercising their rights; the other infringes no right belonging to the plaintiffs and allows the full exercise by the defendants of their right to levy upon the \"right to repurchase.\"\u00a0 The ambiguity is due to the inapt language used by the plaintiffs in their complaint.\u00a0 Under these circumstances, it seems to me that, as a matter of construction as well as of equity, the latter meaning should have been adopted.\u00a0 It further occurs to me that in thus seizing upon the loose language of the sheriff, who had no real interest in the case, to establish a cause of action in favor of the plaintiffs, is a very unusual application of the rule that defects in the complaint are cured by admissions in the answer.\u00a0 But it is certainly unjust, in my opinion, to thus determine the cause of action\u00a0 stated in the complaint.\u00a0 By so doing, paragraph 7 is left entirely without force and effect.\u00a0 This is the only section of the\u00a0 complaint which alleges the invasion of any right belonging to any person. At the time this paragraph was framed, the notice of the sale was public property, and\u00a0 the interests to be sold were stated therein.\u00a0 What was stated in that notice was used by the plaintiffs\u00a0 in\u00a0 the preparation of paragraph 7. In the absence of the notice of sale itself, from what source at our command may we expect to find a more accurate description of its contents than in this paragraph, prepared by the plaintiffs themselves?\u00a0 It must be conceded that the import of the language there used does not amount to the invasion of any right belonging to the plaintiffs.\u00a0 The demurrer to this complaint should have been sustained on the first ground urged; i. e., \"that the facts set forth in the complaint do not constitute a cause of action in favor of the plaintiff nor against the defendants.\"<\/blockquote>In the meantime, however, a preliminary injunction was issued on the facts set out in the complaint.\u00a0 Of this injunction the court says:<br\/><blockquote>\"It may be true that the terms of the injunction were somewhat broader than the prayer of the complaint.\"<br\/><br\/>For the better consideration of this injunction and its terms, the following facts set forth in the complaint are stated:<br\/><br\/>\"1. The property in question was owned by the plaintiffs.<br\/><br\/>\"2. This property was subject to a right to repurchase in favor of the judgment debtors which had not yet expired.\"<\/blockquote>With the right of repurchase clearly set forth in the complaint, an injunction was issued enjoining further action in regard to this property, or \"any right, interest, or participation in the same.\"\u00a0 The most liberal construction placed upon the complaint by this court is to the effect that it asks for nothing except as to the <i>corpus<\/i> of the property.\u00a0 But the injunction is sweeping.\u00a0 Not only were the plaintiffs protected in their rights, but the defendants\u00a0 were prevented from exercising their undoubted right to levy upon the \"right to repurchase,\" a right which this court admits was theirs.<br\/><br\/>By relying on his demurrer to the complaint, the defendant has apparently lost his right to object to the scope of the injunction.\u00a0 The lower court has held that the right to repurchase expired on\u00a0 December 31, 1907, notwithstanding these proceedings.\u00a0 That judgment has been affirmed by this court, and the defendant is thus finally deprived of the value of the right to repurchase, which, according to his estimate, was P5,000. The injunction bond was for P7,500.<br\/><br\/><br\/><hr align=\"CENTER\" noshade=\"NOSHADE\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><br\/><br\/>Since writing the above, the opinion of the court has been modified.\u00a0 The argument as to the sufficiency of the complaint has been somewhat amplified, but I am still of theopinion that the complaint is fatally deficient and rest this assertion upon the above dissenting opinion.<br\/><br\/>Two additional points have, however, been touched upon by the court.\u00a0 Both relate to matters of pleading, and I am unable to agree with the majority of the court on either point.\u00a0 Whereas this case\u00a0 at first turned merely upon the sufficiency of the complaint on demurrer, it has now become the foundation for a doctrine of pleading which, with the profoundest respect for the judgment of my associates, I consider new in principle and unsupported by authority.<br\/><br\/>The first of these points is as to the sufficiency of the demurrer.\u00a0 The court says that granting that the complaint does not state a cause of action, the demurrer is also insufficient.\u00a0 The demurrer reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"Comes now the defendant in the above-entitled cause and interposes a demurrer against the complaint in this cause based upon the following grounds:<br\/><br\/>\"1. That the facts set forth in the complaint do not constitute a cause of action in favor of the plaintiff or against the defendants.<br\/><br\/>\"2. That the complaint is ambiguous, unintelligible, and vague.\"<\/blockquote>The second ground of demurrer is not urged on this appeal and could not have been considered in any case in view of the fact that the defendant answered after the overruling of his demurrer.<br\/><br\/>Section 91 was borrowed from the California Code of Civil Procedure, sections 430 and 431.\u00a0 The decisions of the supreme court of that State, therefore, as to the import of the language there used are entitled to great weight in construing section 91 of our Code.\u00a0 In the late case (1908) of Burke <i>vs<\/i>. Maguire (154 Cal., 456, 462) the very point at issue was decided by that court without a single dissenting vote.\u00a0 The court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"It is urged that this point cannot be considered in this court on appeal because it is in the nature of matter in abatement and the general demurrer merely states that this count 'does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against said\u00a0 defendant,' without specifying this omission as the particular point in which it was claimed to be lacking.\u00a0 It was decided in this State very soon after the adoption of the Practice Act, which in this respect is the same as the present Code of Civil Procedure, that a general demurrer need not specify the particulars wherein the complaint failed to state facts constituting a cause of action, but that, if couched in the language above quoted, it would search the entire complaint, or the count thereof to which it was directed, for any and every failure to state a material fact.\u00a0 (Ellisen <i>vs<\/i>. Halleck, 6 Cal., 393; Williamson <i>vs<\/i>. Blattan, 9 Cal., 501.) Afterwards, in Brown <i>vs<\/i>. Martin (25 Cal., 91), an exception to this rule was made in cases where the bar of the statute of limitations appeared on the face of the complaint.\u00a0 Apparently, though not expressly applying the familiar common law rule that the benefit of this statute is a personal privilege which is waived unless specially pleaded, the court, in that case, held that a general demurrer which did not specify the bar of the statute as the defect relied on was insufficient to present that objection.\u00a0 This precedent has been uniformly followed ever since, so far as the statute of limitations is concerned.\u00a0 The opinion in the case also attempted to establish and recommended the future observance of a rule to the effect that a general demurrer must always specify the particular facts which it is claimed are not alleged, else it will be disregarded. <i>This attempt proved futile<\/i>, and in Kent <i>vs<\/i>. Snyder (30 Cal., 666) the rule suggested\u00a0 was repudiated\u00a0 and it was declared that no specifications were necessary in a general demurrer, except where the benefit of a personal privilege, such as the statute of limitations, was claimed.\u00a0 Thenceforward, this has been the accepted rule of pleading, and, so far as we are aware, the statute of limitations is the only personal privilege which has been declared to fall within the exception.\"<\/blockquote>In Kent <i>vs<\/i>. Snyder (30 Cal., 666, 672) the court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The statute provides that unless the demurrer shall distinctly specify the grounds upon which any of the objections to the complaint are taken, it shall be disregarded, excepting only the objection to the jurisdiction of the court and the objection that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.\u00a0 (Practice Act, sees. 41 and 45.) Sections 41 and 45 of the Act are to be read in conjunction.\u00a0 To give unqualified force and effect to the former without regard to the excepted objections specified in the latter would be to abrogate an important provision of the statute.\u00a0 This we have no right to do, and hence we hold the objection taken by demurrer to the complaint that it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action to be well and sufficiently assigned in the language of the statute.\"<\/blockquote>And in Ellisen <i>vs<\/i>. Halleck (6\u00a0 Cal., 386, 393), where the demurrer was on the grounds, first, that the court had no jurisdiction either of the persons of the said defendants or of the subject of\u00a0 the action, and second, that the complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause\u00a0 of action, the court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The\u00a0 objection that the demurrer does not 'distinctly specify the grounds on which the objections to the complaint are taken would perhaps be maintained were it not for the fact that the courts of this State, following the analogies of the New York Code, have adopted the construction of her courts upon this subject, and maintained the sufficiency of such a demurrer.\"<\/blockquote>An examination of the law and decisions of New York to which reference is made in this latter quotation will show, first, that the language of the New York statute on the subject of demurrer (sees. 488 and 490, 1 Bliss, Code, 622, 642) is practically identical with that of the California statute, with the exception that the former specifically provides by section 490 that a demurrer on the ground in question \"may be stated in the language of\" the statute, which is, \"That the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action;\" and secondly, that the decisions of the New York courts on this point are practically one in sustaining a demurrer in such form.\u00a0 (Durkee <i>vs<\/i>. Saratoga &amp; W. R. Co., 4 How. Prac, 226; Johnson <i>vs<\/i>. Wetmore, 12 Barb., 145; Haire <i>vs<\/i>. Baker, 5 N. Y., 357; Paine <i>vs<\/i>. Smith, 9 N. Y. Super. Ct. (2 Duer), 298.) It\u00a0 is the form now in use in that jurisdiction. (See Long Island JR. R. Co. <i>vs<\/i>. City of New York, 199 N. Y., 288; Hirsch <i>vs<\/i>. New England\u00a0 Nav. Co., 200 N. Y., 263; Witherbee <i>vs<\/i>. Bowles, 201 N. Y., 427.)<br\/><br\/>In Indiana, where the grounds for demurrer are practically the same as in California and New York, but <i>no provision is made<\/i> as to what language shall be used in stating the demurrer, the supreme court of that State has consistently held since the adoption of the code\u00a0 system of pleading that a demurrer in the language of the statute which is \"That the\u00a0 complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action\" (sec. 344, subdivision 5, 1 Burns' Stat, 189) is good. (Pace <i>vs<\/i>. Oppenheim, 12 Ind., 533; Petty <i>vs<\/i>. Board, 70 Ind., 290; Ross <i>vs<\/i>.\u00a0 Menefee,\u00a0 125 Ind., 432; 25 N. E., 545; Hay <i>vs<\/i>. Bash, 37 App. Div., 167; 76 N. EM 644.)<br\/><br\/>The provisions of the code in North Dakota are very similar to\u00a0 those of California and our own jurisdiction.\u00a0 Section 6855, R. S. 1905, provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"The demurrer shall distinctly\u00a0 specify the grounds of objection to the complaint Unless it does so, it may be disregarded. *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\"<\/blockquote>Section 6854 (<i>idem<\/i>) provides as one of the grounds of demurrer as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"6. That the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.\"<\/blockquote>Nevertheless no objection is made to demurrers couched in the language of the statute under the above provision of the code.\u00a0\u00a0 (Tisdale <i>vs<\/i>. Ward County, 20\u00a0 N. D., 401; Weber <i>vs<\/i>. Lewis, 19 N. D., 473.)\u00a0 It may be well to here note that a distinction is made in this jurisdiction between a demurrer submitted as a part of the pleadings had\u00a0 prior to the opening of the\u00a0 trial, and a demurrer, <i>ore tenus<\/i>, offered after the trial has begun.\u00a0 In the latter case it has been held that a demurrer is not sufficient unless it points out defects in the complaint relied upon.\u00a0 (James River National Bank <i>vs<\/i>. Purchase, 9 N. D., 280.)<br\/><br\/>The Code of Missouri, section 599 (1 Ann. Stat., 1906, 627), provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"The demurrer shall distinctly specify the grounds of objection to the pleadings.\u00a0 Unless it does so, it may be disregarded.\"<\/blockquote>The supreme court of that State has held that a demurrer on the ground that the complaint does not state facts sufficient, etc., is good if to follows the language of the statute, which is the same as that used in our own code.\u00a0 (Wilson <i>vs<\/i>. Polk County, 112 Mo., 126; 20 S. W., 469; Darby <i>vs<\/i>. Cabanne, 1 Mo. App., 126; Hanson <i>vs<\/i>. Neal, 215 Mo., 256, 114 S. W., 1073.)<br\/><br\/>In O'Rourke <i>vs<\/i>. City of Sioux Falls (46 Am. St. Rep., 760; 4 S. D., 47; 54 N. W., 1044; 19 L. R. A., 789) the supreme court of South Dakota disposes of this point as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"A preliminary question is presented\u00a0 by the contention of appellant that, under section 4910 of the Compiled Laws, providing that the demurrer shall be disregarded unless it distinctly specify the grounds of objection, the court should have refused to entertain the demurrer, and, in the language of the statute, should have disregarded it.\u00a0 Appellant contends that even if, generally, that form of demurrer is allowable, as 'where the question is a lack of sufficient allegations in the complaint, yet it is not sufficient where it is attempted to take advantage of affirmative facts alleged in the complaint.' While we recognize some force and reason in the suggestion, we think the distinction has not generally been observed, and that the contrary rule prevails. (Maxwell's Code Pleading, 381; Bayliss on Code Pleading, 216, 217; Bliss on Code Pleading, sec. 416; Getty <i>vs<\/i>. Hudson River R. R.\u00a0 Co., 8 How. Pr., 177; Henderson <i>vs<\/i>. Johns, 13 Col.,\u00a0 280; Greensburgh, etc., Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Sidener, 40 Ind., 424.)\"<\/blockquote>Pleadings are designed to create only the skeleton or framework of a lawsuit.\u00a0 Their whole purpose is to form an issue by statements and denials, upon which a hearing may be had.\u00a0 Only ultimate facts are to be stated in the pleadings.\u00a0 Probative facts, conclusions\u00a0 of law, argumentation, etc., have no place in these preliminary proceedings.\u00a0 (See Green <i>vs<\/i>. Palmer, 15 Cal., 411.)\u00a0 After the issue has been formed, a hearing upon that issue is the place for all these matters.\u00a0 If a demurrer (which is one of the irregular parts of pleading) is interposed at the proper time, before a hearing is had, upon the ground that the pleading of the adverse party does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, an issue is immediately formed.\u00a0 A demurrer of this kind searches the whole record.\u00a0 To require the pleader to show in his demurrer <i>why<\/i> a complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action is to compel him to inject into his demurrer argument or conclusions of law, a procedure utterly at variance with the philosophy of the reformed procedure.\u00a0 If the pleader is there required to show the why and wherefore of his demurrer, at what point shall pleading cease and argument begin?\u00a0 It would be manifestly unfair to limit him to a certain number of words, as in some cases a very few words might suffice; while in others,\u00a0 where questions of negligence, liability in tort, in contract, etc., are involved, it often requires a lengthy brief to set forth the law on the subject.\u00a0 The issue would thus become beclouded and it would be often impossible to say whether the\u00a0 defendant had demurred to or answered the complaint.<br\/><br\/>Referring again to the stand taken by the majority of the court on this point, it is said that even admitting all that is said about the complaint (which is that it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action), the demurrer is\u00a0 also imperfect.\u00a0 It is not error to sustain a demurrer so defective <i>in form<\/i> as to present no question for decision, where the complaint to which it is addressed is insufficient for want of facts. (Garrett <i>vs<\/i>. Bissell, etc., Works, 154 Ind., 319; Spaulding <i>vs<\/i>. Mott, 167 Ind., 58.)\u00a0 As is sometimes said, \"a bad plea is sufficient for a bad declaration.\"<br\/><br\/>The second ruling contained in the majority opinion is that, given a complaint which fails to allege facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, and a demurrer to the same for that reason improperly overruled, no reversible error exists where it appears that evidence was presented at the trial without objection from the defendant which supplies the defects in the complaint.\u00a0 It must be remembered that the defects in such a case do not consist of matters of form, but of substance; that is, matters of substance wholly lacking in the complaint and riot to be legitimately inferred from other facts which may be stated in the complaint.<br\/><br\/>My dissent in the case at bar is based upon the ground that the complaint only goes so far as to allege that the sheriff was seeking to attach the interest (that is, the right to repurchase)\u00a0 of Mendezona et al. in the property in question; that it does not allege, by fair construction and interpretation, that the sheriff had attemped to attach the <i>corpus<\/i> of the said property, nor is such defect supplied by any subsequent pleading.\u00a0 Neither can it be legally inferred from the assertion that the sheriff had attached the interest which Mendezona had in the property that he had also attached the interest which the plaintiffs had in the property.\u00a0 Certainly, with the\u00a0 pleadings\u00a0 in such a state, it cannot be said that any <i>cause<\/i> of action was presented to the lower court for decision. And that no amount of evidence would supply this defect in the pleadings is abundantly supported by authority.<br\/><br\/>In Arnold <i>vs<\/i>. American Insurance Co. (148\u00a0 Cal., 660, 661) the court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"It is claimed that the amended complaint failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. <i>A general demurrer for want of facts was interposed in the lower court and overruled<\/i>.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"The complaint nowhere alleged that at the time of any of these fires either house was occupied as a dwelling house, or that the furniture\u00a0 insured was contained in\u00a0 the\u00a0 house No. 735 Stewart Street, nor did it allege any facts from which such a conclusion might be inferred or even surmise<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"The insurer was not liable upon the policies at all, except upon\u00a0 proof that the Joss occurred within the terms of the policy.\u00a0 It was therefore essential to the statement of any cause of action that a loss within the terms of the policy should be alleged.\u00a0 That the houses were occupied as dwelling houses at the time of the tires, and that the furniture was at such times contained in the specified house, were essential to [any liability on the part of the defendant, and therefore essential to] the statement of a cause of action.\u00a0 Not being alleged, they must be taken as haying no existence.

Cadwallader (158 Ind., 202, 205), the court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"If\u00a0 an averment essential to the sufficiency of a pleading is omitted therefrom, and the special finding finds said omitted averment, which, if it had been contained in the pleading, would have rendered the same sufficient, this will not supply the allegation omitted, or otherwise cure the defect in the complaint, for the reason that such a finding is outside the issues, and must be disregarded.\u00a0 (Citing many cases.)<br\/><br\/>\"A special finding, special verdict, or answer to interrogatories cannot supply essential averments omitted from a pleading, but many show that errors in rulings on pleadings were harmless.\" (Citing many additional cases.)<\/blockquote>\u00a0And the general rule is stated as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"A pleading which wholly and completely fails to state any cause of action or defense, so that the omitted allegations cannot properly be presumed to have been proved, is not cured by verdict.\u00a0\u00a0 As the rule is sometimes stated, a verdict cures a defectively alleged cause of action, but not the allegation of a defective cause of action.\"\u00a0 (31 Cyc, 770, citing a long array of authorities.)<\/blockquote>Finally, had there been no demurrer to the complaint on the ground in question, the objection in this court for the first time would have been properly presented for consideration.<br\/><br\/>This objection that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action is not waived by failure to demur, and may be taken at any stage of the case.\u00a0 (Code Civ. Proc, sec. 434.) Nor is the omission cured by verdict or judgment. (Buckman <i>vs<\/i>. Hatch, 139 CaL, 53; 72 Pac, 445; Bell <i>vs<\/i>. Thompson, 147 Cal., 689, 694.)<br\/><br\/>There is here another interpretation by the supreme court of California of the section of their Code which corresponds to our section 93.\u00a0 Under any state of the pleaings, the objection in question was properly presented to this court for decision.<br\/><br\/>All the cases cited in the majority opinion in support of this second proposition deal with attempts to appeal from the ruling on a demurrer before judgment was rendered int he lower court.\u00a0 It is submitted that these cases are not controlling where, as in this case, judgment had been rendered and the ruling ont he demurrer regularly brought to this court as an assigned error.<br\/><br\/>The lower court evidently took the same view of the complaint as the majority of this court has taken.\u00a0 If it were insufficient, due to the failure to allege the the sheriff was invading the rights of the plaintiffs, the lower court would nevertheless have deemed evidence admissible on the point, when clearly it was not admissible.\u00a0 It is also clear, therefore, that whether, as a matter of fact, the sheriff was actually attempting to attach the <i>corpus<\/i> of the property, or whether he was only attempting to attach the right to repurchase, the complaint, as it appears to me, failing to show the former state of facts, and no amount of evidence could cure this substantial defect.\u00a0 The complaints states no cause of action.\u00a0 Plaintiff failed to allege that the sheriff was attempting to sell the <i>corpus<\/i> of the property.\u00a0 This omitted averment cannot be implied or inferred from the facts which are alleged, especially if the allegations in paragraph 7 be kept in mind. As to whether or not the sheriff was attempting to sell the <i>corpus<\/i> of the property was not put in issue by the complaint.\u00a0 If the court did as a matter of fact find that this was what the sheriff was attempting to do, such a finding was outside of the issues and should be disregarded.<br\/><br\/>Again, neither the sufficiency of the demurrer nor the effect produced by overruling it was ever raised by anyone at any time.\u00a0 The plaintiffs always accepted it as sufficient; but this court upon its own motion has entered into an extended discussion upon these two points and announced a new and untried practice without the questions ever having been discussed by the partyies.\u00a0 It is a cardinal principle that appellate courts will rarely, if ever, discuss and decide question of this importantance without the same having been raised by the parties.<br\/><br\/>Again, the court says:<br\/><blockquote>\"The demurrer was not argued in the court below and the order overruling it does not indicate that the court was informed as to the specinc grounds upon which it was based.\"<\/blockquote>Here this court says that the appellant and his counsel failed in their duty in not arguing their demurrer, when, as a matter of fact, neither the appellant nor his counsel ever received notice of the day set for the hearing upon the demurrer.\u00a0 The overruling of the demurrer took place in their absence and without their knowledge.\u00a0 Immediately after they were notified that the demurrer had been overruled they appeared and moved the court to set aside that order and give them\u00a0 an opportunity to be heard.\u00a0 Counsel were anxious to argue the question, but the court refused to hear them and denied their motion.\u00a0 The appellant duly excepted and now assigns as an error this action of the court.\u00a0 To now hold in the face of these facts that counsel failed in the performance of their duty is, in my opinion, wholly unwarranted.<br\/><br\/>And again, this court says that the trial court found that the sheriff was attempting to sell the <i>corpus<\/i> of the property and that as the appellant has failed to bring the testimony to this court that finding of fact cannot be disturbed. The appellant made a motion for a new trial upon the ground that the findings of fact were contrary to the weight of the evidence.\u00a0 This motion was overruled and exception noted.\u00a0 The stenographic notes are in the record in this court, but it is true that they have not been transcribed and we therefore cannot read them; but in view of all the facts and circumstances in this case I think that in the interests of justice the appellant should be given an opportunity to have these notes transcribed so this court could determine with absolute certainty whether or not the sheriff was attempting to sell the <i>corpus<\/i> of the property of merely the right to repurchase of Mendezoha.<br\/><br\/>As a legal proposition, I am of the opinion that the judgment should be reversed with instructions to the lower court to sustain the demurrer and give the plaintiffs an opportunity to amend if they so desire.<br\/><br\/><br\/><hr align=\"CENTER\" noshade=\"NOSHADE\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><br\/><br\/>Since writing the second edition of this dissent, the court has again revised its opinion.\u00a0 The questions involved in this case are:<br\/><blockquote>\"1. Does the complaint state a cause of action?<br\/><br\/>\"2. Is a demurrer to a complaint, on the ground that it does not state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action, bad, if stated in the language of the statute?<br\/><br\/>\"3. Is a complaint which fails to state a cause of action cured by\u00a0 verdict or judgment, or, as this court prefers to state it, by the\u00a0 introduction of evidence without objection at the trial?\"<\/blockquote>The court answers all these questions in the affirmative, while I am of the opinion that each should be answered in the negative.<br\/><br\/>1. I am still content to rest\u00a0 my opinion as to the first proposition upon the first edition of this dissenting opinion.<br\/><br\/>2. As to the form of a demurrer addressed to the complaint on the ground of insufficient facts, the court has examined the authorities presented in the above dissenting opinion (which do,not by any means exhaust the list) and has declined to accept them as correctly expounding the law in this jurisdiction.\u00a0 As I conceive the position taken by the court, a new principle of pleading is established by its decision; a principle which deals with a much-used\u00a0 branch of pleading, and this decision is, therefore, of vital interest to every practitioner and court in this jurisdiction.\u00a0 It is a doctrine that has heretofore never been announced by the court and flatly\u00a0 disapproves of a form of demurrer which has heretofore been in constant use in this jurisdiction and accepted in this court without question as submitting the complaint to the test of law. Pascual <i>vs<\/i>. Del Saz Orozco (19 Phil. Rep., 82), Duran <i>vs<\/i>. Arboleda (20 Phil. Rep., 253), and Grattage <i>vs<\/i>. Standard Fuel Company (20 Phil. Rep., 460) are some <i>late<\/i> cases in which this form of demurrer was used without question.\u00a0 The point was not raised by counsel on either side, and the court's standing is admittedly at variance with the interpretation of an identical statute of long standing in another jurisdiction.\u00a0 By its decision upon the third question, the ruling of the court upon this point is rendered unnecessary to the disposition of the case.\u00a0 In the face of these conditions, it is difficult to understand the necessity of announcing such a ruling at this time.\u00a0 The original opinion of the court, as already stated, contained no suggestion\u00a0 that the court based any part of its decision sustaining the judgment of the lower court on the fact that the demurrer was too defective in form to raise a question as to the sufficiency of the complaint.\u00a0 In the first revision of that opinion the court first intimated that the <i>form<\/i> of the demurrer itself effectually barred the defendants from attacking the complaint.\u00a0 In the second revision, after an examination of the authorities, it has unequivocally sustained its position that a demurrer in the language of the statute will not raise the question of the sufficiency of the complaint.<br\/><br\/>The argument in chief in this last revision of the majority opinion, inferentially at least, considers a demurrer in the language of the statute\u00a0 a relic of the common law, which tends to cause the plaintiff delay and expense and conceals instead of discloses the real objection to the complaint.\u00a0 The court says:<br\/><blockquote>\"A demurrer, for example, should\u00a0 not leave the court and the party against whom it is aimed as ignorant of the defect in the offending pleading as before the demurrer is filed.\u00a0 Many times the objection that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action means very little.\u00a0 There are occasions, of course, when it is sufficient.\u00a0 But it is certain that no injury can ever result from naming the <i>precise reason<\/i> why the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action; and, in the great majority of cases, great good will come of it.\"<\/blockquote>If all that is alleged against this form of demurrer be true, it is difficult to understand just why there are so many modern authorities sustaining it.\u00a0 It is said that the law in the State of New York is dissimilar to our own in that it <i>permits<\/i> the demurrer for this cause to be stated in the language of the statute.\u00a0 It is true that this provision of law places it beyond the power of any court to disapprove of a demurrer in that particular form, but the question arises, Why does the law permit it?\u00a0 The State of New York (some sixty years ago) was the first to break the shackles of the common law pleading and enact a code of procedure.\u00a0 This code has been copied in its substantial parts in the great majority of the jurisdictions of the United States, and our own is no exception.\u00a0 During all this time, in the State which initiated the crusade against the common law with its costly and tedious procedure, we not only find this form of demurrer sanctioned by usage but safeguarded by law.\u00a0 If it be argued that this\u00a0 seeming backwardness in the State of New York is due to the obtuseness of the legislature or to powerful influences whose selfish interests are subserved\u00a0 by maintaining this particular feature of the common law pleading despite its incongruity in the code, let us turn to the sovereign State of Indiana, where no provision is made as to what form the demurrer shall take.\u00a0 We find the courts there, by an unbroken line of decisions, upholding this particular form, while the legislature has made no attempt to\u00a0 correct the practice.\u00a0 It is practically admitted by the court that the interpretation of a law exactly similar to our own in California is contrary to this doctrine which is to take its place in our practice.\u00a0 This court does not, however, accept as controlling the decisions from North Dakota and Missouri as to the form of the demurrer.\u00a0 No reason is given for this stand.\u00a0 The statutes of those States, as pointed\u00a0 out above, have the same provision as is found in our section 91, Code of Civil Procedure, that:<br\/><blockquote>\"The demurrer must distinctly specify the grounds upon which any\u00a0 of the objections to the complaint\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 are taken.\"<\/blockquote>It is this provision in our own law which the court construes to require a detailed statement of the allegations of fact which are lacking in the complaint.\u00a0 But whether the court admits any of these authorities to be contrary to its holding or not, certainly the chief argument against the demurrer in the language of the statute, that it is not in harmony \"with the liberal tendency of procedural laws,\" loses much of its force when we find it in vogue in so many jurisdictions where this tendency is at work.\u00a0 Nor, so fat as I am aware, have any objections ever been made by bench or bar in this jurisdiction of the vagueness or inconvenience resulting from a demurrer in this form.<br\/><br\/>By the new rule the demurrer itself is open to the charge that it is \"ambiguous, unintelligible, or uncertain.\"\u00a0 The sufficiency of the demurrer to present\u00a0 the insufficiency of the complaint must first be passed upon.\u00a0 No other formula that human ingenuity has ever devised so completely and unequivocally raises an issue as to the sufficiency of the complaint as the one now disapproved by this court.\u00a0 It is clear and it is direct.\u00a0 It is brevity personified.\u00a0 And it has a certainty of meaning rarely equaled.\u00a0 Again, it searches the whole record.\u00a0 On the other hand, the inquiry on a demurrer enumerating the allegations of fact upon which the defendant bases it will, of course, be restricted to the\u00a0 matters therein set forth.\u00a0 By thus limiting the scope of the demurrer, its efficiency is impaired and its object, in part at least, defeated.\u00a0 After a careful examination of section 91,I can find no provision which restricts the inquiry on the demurrer to any particular portion of the complaint.<br\/><br\/>3. The third and last question upon which I differ with the court is the most important.\u00a0 The court, without either agreeing to or dissenting from the authorities which hold that a complaint which fails to state a cause of action is not cured by verdict or judgment, disposes of this proposition and the authorities in its support in the following language: <br\/><blockquote>\"It must be observed, however, that we are not asserting that a\u00a0 cure of the complaint is brought about by a verdict or a judgment.\u00a0 Our contention is that the cure is brought about by defendant's own act.\u00a0 An issue may be joined as well at the trial as before.\u00a0 The reason why issues are required by law to be joined before trial is to give all the parties due notice of the claims against them, thereby offering full and fair opportunity to produce their witnesses and meet the charges against them.\u00a0 But, where the issue, by some defect in the complaint or answer, has not really been joined before the trial, the parties may, by mutual consent, join issue at the trial.\u00a0 Issues may be raised between the parties in\u00a0 other ways than by pleadings.\u00a0 They may be raised on the trial by the evidence of the parties.\u00a0 However defective the complaint may be, if the parties go to trial, and, without objection from the defendant, the plaintiff proves facts sufficient to constitute a particular cause of action, and the defendant voluntarily produces his witnesses to meet the cause of action thus proved, there is then and there joined an issue as fully and effectively as if it had been joined long before by the most perfect pleadings.\"<\/blockquote>I am very much of the opinion, however, that the principle of law and the authorities which the court declines to consider as being in point are very much so.\u00a0 When we consider that both verdicts and judgments are based, so far as the facts\u00a0 are concerned, upon the evidence admitted at the trial, it is mere quibbling to say that there is a distinction in meaning between the phrase \"a complaint cured by verdict or judgment\" and \"a complaint cured by evidence admitted at the trial.\"\u00a0 Evidence admitted at the trial is always followed by verdict or judgment, by which form and effect are given to it.\u00a0 By using the term \"verdict or judgment,\" we include in the name of the whole one of the heterogeneous parts; the genus includes the species.<br\/><br\/>In Goodwine <i>vs<\/i>. Cadwallader (158 Ind., 202), one of the authorities cited, <i>supra<\/i>, it is expressly said that a special finding, special verdict, or answer to interrogatories cannot supply essential averments omitted from a pleading.\u00a0 All of these are based upon the evidence admitted\u00a0 at the trial.\u00a0 In Daly, Admr., <i>vs<\/i>. New Haven (69 Conn., 644), the court quoted the following from\u00a0 Ives <i>vs<\/i>. Goshen (63 Conn,, 79, 82):<br\/><blockquote>\"It is not enough that a party <i>prove<\/i> facts constituting a cause of action; he must also have <i>alleged<\/i> them before he can recover.\"<\/blockquote>If the pains be taken to examine the authorities cited in support of the general rule in 31 Cyc, 770, quoted <i>supra<\/i>, it will be found that the rule applies, regardless of whether evidence was admitted at the trial.<br\/><br\/>Pomeroy on Code Remedies, \u00a7 550, says:<br\/><blockquote>\"It has even been held that where a cause of action is so defectively set out that a demurrer for want of sufficient facts would have been sustained, but the adverse party answers instead, and goes to trial, the objection to the pleading is hereby waived, and evidence in its support must be admitted.\u00a0 Other cases are directly opposed to this position, and expressly declare that if the complaint or petition fails to state any cause of action the objection is not waived, and all evidence should be excluded\u00a0 at the trial, even though the defendant has answered; and this ruling is in exact conformity with the provisions of all the codes regulating the use of demurrers.\u00a0 The doctrine first stated is clearly erroneous, and the <i>dicta<\/i> or decisions which sustain it ought to be wholly disregarded; it violates the section of the codes which enacts that the absence of sufficient facts as a ground of demurrer is not abandoned by an omission to demur; and it utterly ignores the established distinction between a failure to state any cause of action\u00a0 and the statement of a cause of action\u00a0 in an imperfect and defective manner.\u00a0 It is only when the answer itself by some of its averments supplies the omission in a complaint or petition otherwise demurrable, that the fault is cured and the objection waived by answering; <i>mere<\/i> answering instead of demurring cannot produce that effect.\u00a0 If the averments are so defective, if the omission\u00a0 of material facts is so great that, even under the rule of a liberal construction, no cause of\u00a0 action is stated, it is not a mere case of insufficiency but one of complete failure; and the complaint or petition should be dismissed at the trial, or a judgment rendered upon it should be reversed.\"<\/blockquote>It appears to me that the court's ruling is a radical departure from the authorities on the subject.<br\/><br\/>Section 90 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"The complaint <i>must<\/i> contain:<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"2. A brief statement of the facts constituting the cause of action *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.\"<\/blockquote>A casual reading of this section would indicate that this was mandatory and not merely directory or permissive.\u00a0 Under the new rule, this must be read as merely directory or permissive; or, in other words, \"The complaint may contain,\" since by mutual consent the parties may agree upon an issue which it does not contain.<br\/><br\/>By mutual consent, the pleadings may be wholly abandoned and an action in its inception <i>ex contractu<\/i> may conclude <i>ex delicto<\/i>.\u00a0 The court will be powerless to rule upon the admission of evidence so long as the parties\u00a0 mutually agree that it shall be received.\u00a0 By the same method, parties may confer jurisdiction upon the court of the subject matter of the action (a heretofore unheard-of privilege).<br\/><br\/>But the court evidently means to apply this rule to other cases than those where there is a mutual agreement as to what the issues shall be.\u00a0 In the present case there is no authority for assuming that there was a mutual agreement between the parties that evidence should be admitted showing that an attempt was made to levy upon the <i>corpus<\/i> of the property; nor, indeed,\u00a0 is there anything to\u00a0 indicate that such evidence was admitted without objection from the defendant.\u00a0 The rule therefore applies to those cases where there is no agreement between the parties as to what the evidence shall be.\u00a0 In other words, it applies to evidence <i>admitted<\/i> at the trial, whether with or without objection.<br\/><br\/>On appeal to this court, the pleadings will serve no useful purpose.\u00a0 If a transcript of the record is not elevated to this court, the inquiry on appeal will be limited to a consideration of the facts found in the decision of the lower court.\u00a0 If the facts\u00a0 of the case are not sufficiently set out in the decision of the trial court, an embarrassing situation will result.\u00a0 The pleadings cannot be relied upon to state the issues upon which the case was tried, and it will be necessary to\u00a0 either hazard a guess as to what occurred in the lower court or remand the case with a request for additional facts.<br\/><br\/>Section 93 of the Code of Civil Procedure reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"If no objection be taken to the <i>complaint<\/i>, either by demurrer or answer, the defendant shall be deemed to have waived all objections, excepting only the objection to the jurisdiction of the court over the subject matter, <i>and that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.\"<\/i><\/blockquote>This section expressly reserves to the defendant the right to object to the complaint at any time on the ground that it does not state sufficient facts.\u00a0 Yet the court holds that such defects will be supplied by the admission of evidence without\u00a0 objection.\u00a0 It appears, then, that the defendant's statutory right to object to the sufficiency of the complaint is abridged in certain cases.\u00a0 Nevertheless, the language used in section 93 indicates no exceptions to the rule.<br\/><br\/>Section 109 of the same code provides that if there be an immaterial variance between the allegations in the pleadings and the proof, the pleading shall be forthwith amended; but if it appears that a variance is material and that a party has been misled, the court shall, upon such terms as may be just, order the pleadings to be amended in accordance with the facts.\u00a0 In other words, if there be a variance between the pleadings and the\u00a0 proof, an amendment is required in any case.\u00a0 The pleadings are always considered the very foundation upon which the judgment must rest.\u00a0 If they are not in accordance with the facts they must be so amended as to cover such facts.\u00a0 Defective pleadings cannot be cured by evidence alone.\u00a0 This is the law according to the expressed will of the legislature.\u00a0 But, strange as it may seem, this court has stepped in and said: <br\/><blockquote>\"But where the issue, by some defect in the complaint or answer, has not really been joined before the trial, the parties may, by mutual consent, join issue at the trial.\u00a0 Issues may be raised between the parties in other ways than by pleadings.\u00a0 They may be raised on the trial by the evidence of the parties.\"<\/blockquote>It is unnecessary to enumerate the formidable opportunities for mischief made possible by this very liberal rule for raising an issue.\u00a0 They will undoubtedly suggest themselves as occasion arises to take advantage\u00a0 of the rule.\u00a0 Pleadings, under the new rule, will become a mere formality; an <i>open sesame<\/i> to a field of maneuvering, where counsel will bargain and bicker in the presence of the court as to what the issues of the case shall be.<br\/><br\/>Finally, in any methodical system of raising issues for trial, there must occur isolated instances where a departure from established rules would work a saving\u00a0 of time.\u00a0 But this loss is supposed to be more than compensated by time saved in a great number of other cases by adhering to the system.\u00a0 System, method, adherence to a fixed procedure, in any undertaking is usually recognized as a saving of energy and expense; a guaranty of stability and a surety of dispatch.\u00a0 But if the system be not observed, its beneficial results cannot be obtained.\u00a0 It is only when the cases where the system is inconvenient assume the dignity of a class that its procedure should be amended or disregarded.\u00a0 Admitting for the moment that the doctrine laid down by the court will, in the present case, permit a judgment upon the very merits of the case, as well as a saving of time, it must be remembered that the court has laid its rules in general language, and we must look beyond the present case to note their possible effect.\u00a0 I have always believed and still believe that there are\u00a0 certain well established rules of pleading which are conducive to fairness and\u00a0 justice, and without which the administration of justice must necessarily suffer.\u00a0 I am very much of the opinion that the actual operation of these two rules of pleading will require endless emendations and qualifications to prevent a failure of justice in cases as they come up and that in the end we shall have a system of pleading more cumbersome than the common law itself.<br\/><br\/>Reverting to the merits of this case, if these new rules will have the effect of expediting cases through the courts and facilitate their examination on the merits (a proposition with which I am unable to agree), they will, nevertheless, in my opinion, fail of their purpose in the present case.\u00a0 It appears\u00a0 to me that the equities of this case\u00a0 are altogether with the defendants.\u00a0 The uncertainty of the plaintiff's complaint, the fact that a preliminary injunction was issued manifestly more extensive than was called for, even on the assumption that the complaint correctly set forth the; cause of action stated in the majority opinion, and that the court overruled the demurrer of the defendants without giving them a hearing, could all be corrected by simply permittihg the enunciation of these rules to bide a more opportune time (when the questions have been raised and counsel have had an opportunity to be heard) and remanding the cause on the ground that the complaint does not set forth facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. <\/div>",

PETRONA MENDOZA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">Appeal raised, through a bill of exceptions, by counsel for the plaintiff from the judgment of March 19, 1912, whereby the Honorable Dionisio Chanco, judge, absolved the defendant from the complaint, with the costs against the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>By a written complaint filed on January 15,1912, counsel for Maximino Donato brought suit in the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Sur against Petrona Mendoza, and alleged therein that the plaintiff was the lawful owner of five-sixths of a lot situated in the city of Vigan, including the wooden house with nipa roof constructed on the land; that said lot was bounded on the north by the lot of Mariano Arce, on the east by Calle Magallanes, on the south by Calle Paez, and on the west by a property of unknown ownership, and that a rough plan of the same accompanied the complaint as a part thereof; that, up to about the year 1903, and during the preceding years, he had exercised full control over the said five-sixths of the lot and house in question; that, in the year above mentioned, the defendant usurped the plaintiff's property by seizing the whole of the said house and lot; that, notwithstanding the repeated and friendly demands made upon the defendant to vacate the said property and deliver to the.plaintiff the part thereof occupied by her which belonged to him, she had refused and continued to refuse to do so, and that thereby she has caused him losses and damages to the amount of P200.\u00a0 Said counsel therefore prayed that judgment be awarded in his client's behalf, by holding that the five-sixths of the house and lot referred to belonged to the plaintiff and ordering the defendant to deliver the\u00a0 same to the latter, to pay P200 for losses and damages, and the costs.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the defendant, in answer, admitted paragraphs 1 and 2, but denied the other paragraphs of the complaint.\u00a0 In special defense and as a previous question he alleged that the said five-sixths part claimed by the plaintiff had already been the subject matter of a former suit between the same parties, as shown by the record, No. 325, of a case tried by the same court and relative to a division of property, for, although the herein plaintiff had in that suit set up a claim as the owner and possessor of the said five-sixths part of the property in question and adduced evidence in support of his contention, the court decided that the plaintiff had not proved his alleged ownership\u00a0 and\u00a0 possession, nor his relationship with the original owners of the said parts of the land and building in dispute; that, therefore, the issue now raised was involved in the previous suit and, as the plaintiff did not appeal from the judgment of absolution therein rendered, had acquired the character of <i>res adjudicata<\/i> since it was concerned in a judgment between the same parties and on the same subject matter; and that it was to be presumed that the issues argued in that suit were therein decided (in support of which\u00a0 averment he attached to the answer a certified copy of the judgment rendered in the former case between the same parties); that the defendant had the absolute and exclusive ownership of the property in litigation, and\u00a0 that, in defending herself in this suit until its termination, she had been occasioned losses and damages to the amount of P300.\u00a0 Said counsel therefore prayed that judgment be rendered against the plaintiff by absolving the defendant from the complaint and sentencing the plaintiff to the payment of the losses and damages and the costs.<br\/><br\/>After a hearing of the case and the introduction of evidence by\u00a0 both parties, the court rendered the judgment aforementioned, to which counsel for the plaintiff excepted and moved for its annulment and the holding of a new trial.\u00a0 This motion was denied,\u00a0 exception to the ruling was taken by the plaintiff, and, upon presentation of the appropriate bill of exceptions, the same was approved and forwarded to the clerk of this court.<br\/><br\/>The principal and sole point to be decided in this suit is whether the exception of <i>res adjudicata<\/i> set up by the defendant, Petrona Mendoza, is or is not well founded, for, in an affirmative case, there would be no further need to determine whether or not the plaintiff is entitled to certain portions of the property in dispute and whether or not the other errors assigned to the judgment appealed from are improper and inadmissible.<br\/><br\/>In order to determine whether the issue herein set up by the plaintiff was previously decided in the said case, No. 325, heard by the same court of Ilocos Sur, it is necessary to show the nature and character of the action brought in that suit already terminated and in the present one for recovery.<br\/><br\/>In the final judgment rendered in the said former suit, No. 325, of which\u00a0 defendant's Exhibit 3 is a copy, it is recited that the plaintiff alleged that he was the owner and possessor, <i>pro indiviso<\/i> with the defendant, Petrona Mendoza, and another party named Severino Mendoza, of the property described in the complaint, and claimed to have a share of five-sixths thereof, and that but one-sixth belonged to the two defendants; that the plaintiff, therefore, asked that the said property be divided in the proportion stated; and that one of the defendants did not put in an appearance and the other denied the claim, on the ground that he, together with his brothers, was the owner of the property in question.\u00a0 The court decided that the\u00a0 plaintiff had not proved his ownership and possession of the said property, in the proportion\u00a0 aforementioned, nor the grounds upon which he alleged he became the owner of certain portions of the same, nor his relationship with the predecessors in interest.\u00a0 The defendants, therefore, were absolved from the complaint, without express finding as to costs.\u00a0 So, in the judgment referred to, the plaintiff requested a division or partition of certain <i>pro indiviso<\/i> property on the ground that he was a coowner and copossessor thereof.<br\/><br\/>In the complaint under which the present suit was brought the same plaintiff moved the court to hold that five-sixths of the house and lot in question lawfully belonged to him and must in due course of time be delivered to him by the defendant.\u00a0 Although it is now claimed that the action brought in this case is one for recovery of possession, it is nevertheless true that, both in the present complaint and in the former one which gave rise to that suit already terminated, it is now, as it was then, demanded that five-sixths of the property, the subject matter of the litigation, be delivered to the plaintiff, on the sole ground that he is, and was, the owner thereof.<br\/><br\/>Consequently, if in the first action only\u00a0 a division was asked of the property claimed to be held <i>pro indiviso<\/i>, it was undoubtedly because of the supposition that the plaintiff was coowner thereof; and in the complaint filed in the present case delivery was demanded of the same five-sixths part of the <i>pro indiviso<\/i> property, with no other difference than, that in the former case the plaintiff alleged and took it for granted that he was a coowner of the property held in common and entitled to a five-sixths share thereof, while in the present suit, in demanding the delivery of the said five-sixths of the property he does so as owner of that part and prays the court to hold him to be such.<br\/><br\/>In the midst of the confusion and diversity of the petitions made by the plaintiff, perhaps due to an effort to establish some dissimilarity between the action prosecuted in the present case and that brought in the former one, the sole fact which stands out clear and certain is that in both of them a demand was made for the delivery of the five-sixths of the property considered by the plaintiff lawfully to belong to him, and although the action instituted in the present suit be denominated one for recovery of possession, it is still true that in the case at bar claim is made\u00a0 for a certain portion of <i>pro indiviso<\/i> property, the same portion that was the subject matter of the judgment rendered in the previous case.<br\/><br\/>After Petrona Mendoza, together with another, was absolved from the complaint, under the finding that the plaintiff had not proved that\u00a0 he was the owner and possessor of the property in question, in the proportion stated of five-sixths thereof, and such absolution having become final, under no consideration may it be sustained in accordance with law that the demand\u00a0 made by the same plaintiff in this second suit must be granted, to wit, that the herein defendant, also a defendant in the former case, shall deliver to him the same five-sixths of the property in question on the assumption that such part thereof lawfully belongs to the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>The question of the propriety or impropriety of the delivery by partition of a certain portion of <i>pro indiviso<\/i> property, on the hypothesis that the claimant is the owner thereof, has already been decided by a final judgment, rendered in an action for recovery, and is deemed to be <i>res adjudicata<\/i>, against which no further remedy lies.<br\/><br\/>In order that the exception of <i>res adjudicata<\/i>, in relation to the subject matter of a previous action, may be valid in a subsequent one, it is indispensable that there be between both suits an identity of persons, things and actions; and these requisites must conjointly exist between the first case already\u00a0 finally decided and the second prosecuted afterwards, but pending judgment.\u00a0 It must\u00a0 appear that in the latter case the complaint presented concerns the same thing that was the subject matter of the former one, that the same cause of action is alleged, suppoted by the same grounds and between the same parties.<br\/><br\/>Article 1252 of the Civil Code prescribes, in its first paragraph: \"In order that the presumption of <i>res adjudicata<\/i> may be valid in another suit, it is necessary that, between the case decided by the sentence and that in which the same is invoked, there be the most perfect identity between the things, causes, and persons of the litigants, and their capacity as such.\"<br\/><br\/>Except in the cases specified in\u00a0 paragraph 1 of section 306 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and as provided in paragraph 2 of the same, the effect of a judgment or final order in an action is, in respect to the matter adjudged, conclusive between the parties, and their successors in interest, litigating for the same thing and under the same title, and in the same capacity.<br\/><br\/>In the former suit, finally decided, a division of the property in\u00a0 litigation was requested undoubtedly in order that it might be delivered to the plaintiff, on the presumption that he was a coowner thereof; and in demanding in the case at bar the delivery of the same five-sixths of that property, on the averment that he is the owner of such part thereof, the plaintiff prosecuted, both in that first suit and in the present one, an action based on the same cause, to wit, on the right of ownership which lies in behalf of the coowner of a property held in common, for he who seeks a division of <i>pro indiviso<\/i> property assumes at the start the existence of an ownership right which he, jointly with another, has in such property; therefore, in both the said actions but one single cause is recognized, which is that of the right of ownership alleged by the plaintiff in the present case and in the previous one.<br\/><br\/>It is unquestionable that there is perfect identity between the five-sixths part of the property claimed in the previous suit and the part thereof that is the subject matter of the case at bar.\u00a0 In each case the plaintiff and the defendant are the same persons and both claim under the same title, that of coownership in the property concerned.\u00a0 It is therefore undeniable that between both litigants there is an identity of persons, things, and actions, although the action instituted in the present case be termed one for recovery of possession, and that brought in the former suit, one for division of property, since in both actions but one single cause, motive, or reason is recognized, to wit, the right of ownership which the plaintiff now claims, and previously claimed, to have in the property in litigation.<br\/><br\/>It having been finally decided by a competent judge, and through the absolution of the defendant, Petrona Mendoza, that the plaintiff, Maximo Donato, was not entitled to demand, through a division and as a coowner, the five-sixths part of the property in question, there is no warrant in law to enable us to hold in the present case that he is the lawful owner of the said five-sixths part of the property and to sentence the\u00a0 defendant to deliver the same to him, inasmuch as, pursuant to the provisions of section 307\u00a0 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the right which the plaintiff claims to have in the said five-sixths part of the disputed property was previously adjudged and his claim made in the present suit was necessarily included in the former final judgment.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, it is unnecessary for this court to pass upon the other errors assigned to the judgment appealed from, or to discuss the rights which the plaintiff claims to have in the property in question.\u00a0 Since the plaintiff filed no appeal from the\u00a0 judgment rendered in the former suit, it is evident that he recognized the justness thereof and waived any right he might have had in the said property.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is in accordance with law and is hereby affirmed, with the costs against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Johnson, Carson<\/i> and <i>Trent, JJ<\/i>., concur. <\/div>",

As a result, I issued an order requiring the accused to put the house in a sanitary condition.\u00a0 The accused has complied with a part of the order, but has neglected to comply with the other part.\u00a0 He has not put in a bell-trap as required by paragraph 2 of said order, and he has not put in a bell-trap in the kitchen in the upper part of the house, as required by paragraph 3.\u00a0 He has complied with the remainder.\u00a0 He has not complied with any part of the work required to be done under paragraph 1 of said order.\u00a0 That is to say, he has not placed the ventilator in the closet in the upper part of the house, nor has he installed a closet below.\u00a0 There are living in the lower part of the house in question a Chinese tinner with his familiy and a Filipino silversmith with his family.\u00a0 An American family lives in the upper part of the house.\u00a0 The Chinaman's family consists of three members, but there are some workmen who aid the Chinaman in his work; from two to six of them remain in the tienda all day.\u00a0 I do not know the number of persons in the Filipino family, but the silversmith has three or four workmen.\u00a0 There is no closet in the lower part of the house aside from that which we ordered him to put in.\u00a0 Thus far he has not done the work which we ordered him to do.\"<\/blockquote>This witness testified on cross-examination, in part, that he issued no other or subsequent order to the accused, but he was sure that he had talked with him; that when the house was inspected by him he found therein no dirt or excrement, nor did he find in any of his inspections that the persons who lived in the house were in any way dirtying or committing nuisances on the lower floor.\u00a0 He also stated that some kind of construction for the discharge of the water was necessary in this house, as it collected on the floor and finally ran out upon the adjoining lots.<br\/><br\/>The failure to comply with the requirements of the order in question is admitted.<br\/><br\/>Article 6 of the municipal ordinances of Cebu, as amended by article 3 of Municipal Ordinance No. 111, is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"ART. 6. It shall be the duty of the owner, agent, or other person-in possession and in control of any lot, building, or place, declared to be in bad sanitary condition by the chief sanitary officer, or his representative, to comply with any order duly issued in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance, requiring repairs, improvements, alterations, or necessary construction, or to put the place designated in sanitary condition within the time specified in said order, which time shall not exceed sixty days, except by special permission of the sanitary officer of the district.\"<\/blockquote>Paragraph (<i>jj<\/i>) of section 39 of the Municipal Code is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"(<i>jj<\/i>) Make such ordinances and regulations, not repugnant to law, as may be necessary to carry into effect and discharge the powers and duties conferred by this Act, and such as shall seem necessary and proper to provide for the health and safety, promote the prosperity, improve the morals, peace, good order, comfort, and convenience of the municipality and the inhabitants thereof, and for the protection of property therein; and enforce obedience thereto with such lawful fines or penalties as the municipal council may prescribe under the provisions of paragraph (<i>dd<\/i>) of this section.\"<\/blockquote>It appearing that the city of Cebu at the time this ordinance was enacted had full authority from the Legislature to enact an ordinance upon the subject embraced within it, such ordinance is valid, unless it contravenes the fundamental law of the Philippine Islands, or an Act of the Philippine Legislature, or unless it is against public policy, or is unreasonable, oppressive, partial, discriminating, or in derogation of common right.<br\/><br\/>Where the power to legislate upon a given subject, and the mode of its exercise and the details of such legislation are not prescribed, the ordinance passed pursuant thereto must be a reasonable exercise of the power, or it will be pronounced invalid.\u00a0 (Le Feber <i>vs<\/i>.

Herrera as municipal president of Caloocan to compel the issuance to the plaintiff of a license to operate a cockpit in La Loma and Maypajo in said municipality.\u00a0 Later the summons and complaint were amended bringing in as additional defendants Lope K. Santos as provincial governor of Rizal, the provincial board of that province, and Jose Javier.<br\/><br\/>Certain motions were made in the cause, the hearings in which were set for the 24th day of May, 1913, at 8 o'clock in the morning, at the courthouse in Malolos, Bulacan.\u00a0 All of the parties appeared at that time and place, except Jose Javier.\u00a0 Before the hearing had begun the judge presiding, the Honorable Alberto Barretto, received a telegram from Mr. Cohn, attorney for Jose Javier, as follows:\u00a0 \"In cockpit cases Caloocan intervener and lawyer in Pasig by mistake.\u00a0 Notification says Manila to Pasig.\u00a0 They protest against the trial or the resolution of the motion by reason of lack of competency and disqualification of the judge and for insufficiency of notice.\"\u00a0 In view of this telegram the court adjourned the hearing to the 6th day of June, 1913, at 8.30 a. m., at the same place.\u00a0 On the adjourned day all the parties appeared with their attorneys.\u00a0 Thereupon such proceedings were had that the judge entered the following order:<br\/><blockquote>\"In this case, during the trial on this day, there has been presented for the first time the question of the disqualification of the present judge.\u00a0 The defendants who raised that question first based their objections upon supposed legal grounds, but, in the course of the argument, recognized in open court and publicly that, under the facts in this case and the discussion in connection therewith, there exists no legal reason or foundation whatever upon which such disqualification can be based, and they therefore appeal to the extreme delicacy (<i>extremada delicadeza<\/i>) of the judge making this order, who on his part recognizes that he has all of the independence of judgment necessary to a just decision of the case.<br\/><br\/>\"The judge making this order, although he is fully convinced that there exists no legal reason on account of which he ought to retire from this case, as the provincial fiscal of Rizal, representing the municipal president of Caloocan, the provincial governor, and the provincial board of Rizal, defendants, have publicly recognized, but desiring nevertheless, solely and exclusively for reasons of extreme delicacy to retire voluntarily from the case, does hereby retire therefrom and makes report thereof to the Supreme Court and to the Secretary of Finance and Justice for such action as may be necessary.\"<\/blockquote>This action was thereupon commenced by the plaintiff to obtain a writ of mandamus running to the Honorable Alberto Barretto, as judge of the Court of First Instance of Rizal, requiring him to proceed with the trial of the case from which he had, by said order, voluntarily retired.<br\/><br\/>The contention of the plaintiff, as shown by his complaint, is that the said judge was not disqualified in law or in fact and that he had, therefore, no legal right to retire from the cause; that the only ground upon which the defendants relied and which they alleged or presented to procure the retirement of the judge was that of extreme delicacy (<i>extremada delicadeza<\/i>), they expressly admitting in open court that there\u00a0 existed no legal ground of disqualification and that there were no facts in their possession upon which a, legal disqualification could be based; that the question whether or not the judge had been attorney in the case prior to its presentation to him was not raised by the defendants nor presented to the judge nor was there a resolution thereon; that extreme delicacy not being a legal ground upon which a judge can retire from the trial of a cause, the defendant judge erred when he refused to perform a duty which the law imposed upon\u00a0 him.<br\/><br\/>The defendants (in speaking of \"the defendants\" we do not include the defendant judge of whose answer we shall speak later) demurred to the complaint upon the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.\u00a0 The demurrer was overruled by this court upon the ground that \"under the allegations of the complaint there did not exist any sufficient reason why the Honorable Alberto Barretto should not take cognizance of the case to which the petition for mandamus refers.\"<br\/><br\/>The defendants answered, admitting certain allegations of the complaint and denying others.\u00a0 The important parts of the answers, however, for the purposes in hand, are those which set out facts in the nature of a special defense, the substance of which is that the judge is in fact disqualified by reason of having previously acted as attorney in the pending cause.\u00a0 The answers set up facts tending to establish that defense.<br\/><br\/>The answer of the defendant judge clearly contains no defense to the action\u2014so clearly, in fact, that it is unnecessary to discuss its sufficiency.<br\/><br\/>Demjurrers were filed to the answers upon the ground that they did not state facts sufficient to constitute a defense to the complaint.<br\/><br\/>We have in this case this situation:\u00a0 The plaintiff claims in his complaint and argues on the hearing that the only ground set forth by the defendant in the Court of First Instance as a reason why the judge should refuse to sit in the case was that of extreme delicacy; that the defendants did not present to the judge, nor did the judge decide, the question whether he had been attorney in the action then before him or in any other action in which the issues were identical.\u00a0 The defendants, on the other hand, claim in their answers and argue on the hearing that they presented to the judge as a reason for his retirement not only extreme delicacy but also the fact that he had been attorney for Tranquilina T., Vda. de Angeles, Antonio Bertol, and others, and that Constancio Joaquin was nothing more or less than the representative of those individuals, the judge's former clients, and that, while the names of the parties were different, they were in effect the same; that, while the actions did not bear the same registry number in the court, nevertheless, the the subject matter of the action in which the judge had been attorney was the same as in that then before him; that such facts and considerations were presented to the judge, and he, after due consideration thereof, found them to be well founded and withdrew from the case.<br\/><br\/>Defendants also claim that, even if the question of the judge's acting as attorney in the case was not presented to him, it can nevertheless be presented here for the first time, as any defense is a proper defense which will defeat the action and that if the judge is in fact really disqualified, no matter for what reason and no matter whether presented to the judge or not, this court will not compel him to go forward with the case.<br\/><br\/>Laying aside for the moment the contention of defendants last referred to and confining ourselves to the other contentions of the parties, we may say that, for a decision in this case, it is not material which contention is correct.\u00a0 The same result follows in either case.<br\/><br\/>It must be remembered that the proceeding to disqualify a judge is a proceeding special in its nature taken under a special statute.\u00a0 Section 8 of the Code of Civil Procedure reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Sec. 8. <i>Disqualification of judges<\/i>.\u2014No judge, magistrate, justice of the peace, assessor, referee, or presiding officer of any tribunal shall sit in any cause or proceeding in which he is pecuniarily interested, or related to either party within the sixth degree of consanguinity or affinity, computed according to the rules of the civil law, nor in which he has been counsel, nor in which he has presided in any inferior judicature when his ruling or decision is the subject of review, without the written consent of all parties in interest, signed by them and entered upon the record.<br\/><br\/>\"No challenge as to the competency of any of the officials named in this section shall be received or allowed; but if it be claimed that the official is disqualified by the provisions of this section, the party objecting to his competency may, in writing, file with\u00a0 the official his objection, stating the grounds therefor, and the official shall thereupon proceed with the trial, or withdraw therefrom, in accordance with his determination of the question of his disqualification.\u00a0 His decision shall be forthwith made in writing and filed with the other papers in the case, but no appeal or stay of action shall be allowed from, or by reason of, his decision in favor of his own competency, until after final judgment in his court.\"<\/blockquote>We held, in disposing of the demurrer to the complaint in this action, that extreme delicacy (<i>extremada delicadeza<\/i>) is not a legal ground of retirement.\u00a0 Therefore, if it be held that the judge disqualified himself upon that ground alone he did so illegally, and the writ of mandamus lies to compel him to go on with the case.<br\/><br\/>On the other hand, if the question whether or not the judge had been attorney in a prior action in which the issues were identical with those in the action pending before him was actually presented to him as provided by law, then we are met with the order of the 6th day of June, 1913, in which the judge finds that he was not disqualified for that reason\u2014that is to say, that he had not been attorney in that action or in one involving the same issues.\u00a0 The judge, in the order disqualifying himself, in\u00a0 effect not only asserts that he had not been such attorney, but declares that all of the parties admitted in open court that he had not been such attorney and that he was not, therefore, on that ground, subject to disqualification.\u00a0 The answer of the judge in this case sets forth no fact upon which his disqualification could have been based or predicated, under the law, in the case below.<br\/><br\/>Under the provisions of section 8, having found that he was not disqualified, it was his duty to go forward with the trial of the case; and the parties against whom the finding was made are not permitted to appeal or stay the action by reason of such finding until final judgment is entered after trial on the merits.<br\/><br\/>Summarizing, this, then, is the condition:\u00a0 If the Question of his having been an attorney in the case was presented to the judge, then the question was resolved against defendants, the judge refusing to disqualify himself upon that ground.\u00a0 His retirement was based exclusively upon extreme delicacy, which is no sufficient ground.\u00a0 Having held himself not legally disqualified, the judge should, under section 8 above quoted, have gone on with the\u00a0 trial.\u00a0 On the other hand, if that question was not presented to him, then it cannot be raised in this action, as section 8 requires, as we construe it, that every question involving the disqualification of a judge must, in the first instance, be presented for determination to the judge alleged to be disqualified.\u00a0 It cannot be presented\u00a0 in this court in any way until it has first been passed upon by the judge.<br\/><br\/>Turning now to the contention of the defendants heretofore momentarily laid aside, counsel says, in his argument before this court, that \"Much stress has been laid by opposing counsel on the reasons <i>assigned<\/i> by the Honorable Alberto Barretto for his disqualification in these proceedings.\u00a0 It will be admitted, I think, that it is entirely immaterial what reasons he assigned for his action, provided this court, from the entire record as now presented, finds that such disqualification is <i>reasonable and proper<\/i> and <i>in the interests of justice<\/i>.\u00a0 It may well be that the reasons assigned by the judge did not take into account all the circumstances of the case, or that for obvious reasons he did not care to express them.\u00a0 It may also result that reasons requiring his disqualification have come to light subsequently, of which he was then ignorant.\u00a0 It would certainly be anomalous if this court after inviting answers from the defendants herein should hold itself precluded from taking their allegations into account and be governed entirely by the statement of the judge claimed to be disqualified.\"<br\/><br\/>In considering this argument it should be noted, as we have already intimated, that this court has no authority to take into consideration in the decision of the case before it any fact, circumstance, or objection going to the competency of the judge which was not presented to him below.\u00a0 The judge has exclusive jurisdiction and authority to determine, in the first instance, his own competency, whatever may be the objection or theory upon which that incompetency is urged;\u00a0 and the issues in an action of mandamus to compel a judge to act are confined to the questions presented to and determined by him.\u00a0 Permitting the defendants to answer did not mean that they were to have the opportunity to present to this court facts or make objections which were not presented to and passed upon by the judge.\u00a0 In other words, the defendants are not permitted to create in this court new issues.\u00a0 The sole issue here is whether, upon the facts presented to the judge below, he acted legally m refusing to sit in the case and render judgment therein.\u00a0 Whether he committed an error is determined by an examination of the record made in the court below, together, possibly, with such facts and circumstances as will throw light upon or complete that record, if incomplete or defective.\u00a0 The error of a judge alleged to have been committed in a decision as to his competency can be predicated only upon the facts which he has before him in making his decision.\u00a0 It cannot be based upon new facts, new objections, or new conditions presented here for the first time.\u00a0 The judge himself may not come to this court in this action and urge his disqualification and the validity of his order of retirement upon facts or objections which were not presented to and passed upon by him while sitting in the case below.<br\/><br\/>Counsel says that \"it is entirely immaterial what reasons he assigned for his action, provided this court, from the entire record as now presented, finds that such disqualification is reasonable and proper in the interests of justice.\"\u00a0 It matters not what <i>reasons<\/i> a judge gives for his decision <i>if he has in the record facts sufficient to sustain that decision.<\/i>\u00a0 The trouble here is that the judge below gave in support of his decision not only reasons but facts.\u00a0 While, as we have said, it is immaterial what reason the judge assigns for sustaining his decision, the facts upon which he bases that decision are quite material.<br\/><br\/>Counsel also contends that \"where a judge feels that it would be unlawful or improper for him to act in a case, it is his duty and obligation to so state, irrespective of any challenge.\"\u00a0 Without deciding the question involved in this contention, the obvious answer in this case is, that the judge in his decision in the court below found, and asserted that it was also the admission of the parties, that it was not unlawful or improper for him to act in the case and that there existed no reason whatever why he should not act.<br\/><br\/>It is obvious from the provisions of section 8 that, no matter what may be the reasons which move the judge to disqualify himself\u00a0 in a particular case, it is his duty to place them in the record.\u00a0\u00a0 It is the clear intention of that section to give the\u00a0 parties an opportunity to challenge and contest the sufficiency of those reasons in ah appellate court.\u00a0 This opportunity would be rendered valueless if the judge could remain silent as to those reasons.\u00a0 An appellate court can resolve an appeal only upon the record as presented.\u00a0 If the facts or reasons upon which the judge based his retirement do not appear in the record, the party taking the appeal is deprived of the right to have a determination of the sufficiency of those\u00a0 facts or reasons in the appellate court.\u00a0 It is not sufficient that they be presented to this court in an action of mandamus.\u00a0 His right is to have them passed upon by the judge; and if this court should take cognizance of those facts and\u00a0 objections he might justly claim that it would be usurping the functions of the judge; and that such usurpation would deprive him of the right guaranteed to him by section 8.\u00a0 Moreover, we have held in a recent case (Herrera <i>vs<\/i>. Barretto and Joaquin, <i>ante<\/i>, pp. 245, 272) :<br\/><blockquote>\"It must be remembered that the people of the Philippine Islands may go to the Courts of First Instance to require a public officer to perform his duties; and they have the right to have that court pass upon the whole case and upon every phase thereof and upon every question arising therein.\u00a0 This right is conferred by statute.\u00a0 It must be respected by the courts as well as by others.\u00a0 It would be manifestly illegal, as it would be flagrantly unjust, so long as the court acts within its jurisdiction, to withdraw from the Court of First Instance the consideration of <i>that case<\/i> under color of any proceeding whatever.\u00a0 As long as the court is considering <i>that case<\/i>, its rights and the rights of the litigants to continue to final determination are inviolate.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"Questions which Courts of First Instance are required by law to decide should not be summarily taken from them and presented to this court without first giving\u00a0 them an opportunity of deliberately passing on such questions themselves.\u00a0 The most natural and proper thing to do, when such court, in the judgment of one of the parties has issued an injunction erroneously, is immediately to call the attention of that court to its supposed error and ask for its correction.\u00a0 The strongest reasons of policy and courtesy, if not actual legal right itself, require such procedure; and we discourage all attempts to come to this court upon questions which a court below is entitled to decide without first invoking its judgment thereon.\u00a0 There are special reasons for following this course in cases where the court has acted <i>ex parte<\/i>.\"<\/blockquote>The summary withdrawal from the Court of First Instance of a question which the law gives him a right to decide is thus seen to be more or less of an impropriety; but when that question relates to his own competency the judge has a right to consider it a reflection.<br\/><br\/>From these observations it is clear that the answers either present a question which was presented to the court below and there decided adversely, in which event the judge should have gone forward with the action, or else one that was never presented to the court below and which cannot therefore be heard here.\u00a0 The answers, therefore, disclose no reason why the writ prayed for should not issue.<br\/><br\/>No confusion should result from the fact that the judge refused to sit.\u00a0 That finding was based solely and expressly upon the untenable ground of extreme delicacy (<i>extremada delicadeza<\/i>)\u2014not upon the ground of having been an attorney in the case.\u00a0 That ground, if presented, was rejected.\u00a0 The order or decision of the judge withdrawing from the case does not state facts sufficient to justify the conclusion to withdraw.\u00a0 We treat that decision precisely the same, although perhaps for different reasons, as we would any other decision of a court where the facts stated therein do not justify the conclusion reached.\u00a0 As a consequence, we set aside the order and require the judge to proceed with the trial without prejudice to his right to hear and determine such objections, if any, to his competency as he may consider the law requires.<br\/><br\/>Demurrer sustained and writ issued.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

S. <i>vs<\/i>. Heery, 10 Off.\u00a0 Gaz., 2102.)\u00a0\u00a0 At the same time the appeal of the injured party against the ruling of the court refusing to allow him\u00a0 to submit evidence as to the damages suffered by him was sustained and the case was returned with the following instructions:<br\/><blockquote>\"It is therefore ordered that the record be returned to the court whence it came for the execution of the criminal judgment herein affirmed, and for the further purpose of completing the civil branch of the case.\"<\/blockquote>The lower court duly proceeded to take evidence as to the civil damages sustained by the injured person and then entered the following judgment:<br\/><blockquote>\"I therefore restate the judgment heretofore entered herein and affirmed by the Supreme Court, by finding the defendant, Joseph N.\u00a0 Heery, not guilty of frustrated murder as alleged in the complaint, but find him guilty of a lesser offense included within the charge made in the complaint, that of maliciously inflicting serious\u00a0 injury upon Alex\u00a0 Sternberg, causing him an illness and disability from the performance of any kind of manual labor for more than thirty days, and sentence him to one year and three months of <i>prision correccional<\/i> at Bilibid Prison, and, having found the amount of the indemnity which the defendant should pay, in accordance with the instructions contained in the judgment of the Supreme Court made herein, sentence the defendant\u00a0 to indemnify the complainant, Alex Sternberg, in the sum of P50,500\u00a0 and in case of insolvency to suffer subsidiary imprisonment, and to pay the costs of the action.\"<\/blockquote>The defendant appealed from this judgment, and by his first, third, and fourth assignments of error, raises the question of double jeopardy.<br\/><br\/>It will be noted that the trial court, in its judgment for civil damages says that it <i>restates the judgment by finding the defendant guilty<\/i>.\u00a0 The judicial procedure involved in finding a defendant guilty by restating a final judgment is not well understood.\u00a0 No exercise of judicial discretion is involved in the mere repetition of a final judgment, whether it be restated once or a dozen times.\u00a0 From the ambiguity of the language used, it cannot be determined whether the lower court merely intended to restate the penalty imposed for the sake of convenience or clearness, or whether it actually reconsidered the guilt of the appellant and found that its previous decision was correct.\u00a0 Both were unnecessary and beyond the instructions contained in the judgment of this court, and as the only addition to the judgment was the civil damages which the accused should pay, no attempt being made to change in any manner the punishment imposed upon the\u00a0 defendant, the question does not arise as to the effect such action would have upon the defendant's constitutional rights.\u00a0 In passing, however, it may be remarked that such action would be entirely beyond the jurisdiction of the lower court and absolutely void.<br\/><br\/>The basis for the plea of double jeopardy must be the same, therefore, as though the lower court had strictly confined its judgment to the limits set by the instructions of this court, above quoted.\u00a0 The question is reduced to the determination of whether remanding the case for determination of civil damages and their assessment against the defendant are to be considered as a modification of the punishment, by increasing the penalty or otherwise, meted out to the defendant for the commission of the crime.<br\/><br\/>In this jurisdiction it is well settled that the civil liability of the\u00a0 accused must be determined in the criminal action, unless the injured party expressly waives such liability or reserves his right to have the civil damages determined in a separate action.\u00a0 Section 107 of General Orders\u00a0 No, 58 reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"The privileges now secured by law to the person claiming to be injured by the commission of an offense to take part in the prosecution of the offense and to recover damages for the injury sustained by reason of the same shall not be held to be abridged by the provisions of this order; but such\u00a0 person may appear and shall be heard either individually or by attorney at all stages of the case, and the court upon conviction of the accused may enter judgment against him for the damages occasioned by his\u00a0 wrongful act\u00a0 It shall, however, be the duty of the <i>promotor fiscal<\/i> to direct the prosecution, subject to the right of the person injured to appeal from any decision of the court denying him a legal right.\"<\/blockquote>The procedure under the Spanish Code of Criminal Procedure for determining the civil liability of persons accused of crime, referred to in the above quoted section, has been discussed by this court a number of times.<br\/><br\/>In Springer <i>vs<\/i>. Odlin (3\u00a0 Phil. Rep., 344), it was said:\u00a0 \"By General Orders, No. 58, section 107, the privileges secured by the Spanish law to persons claiming to be injured by the commission of an offense to take part in the prosecution of the offense and to recover damages for the injury sustained by reason\u00a0 of the same, are preserved and remain in force, and it is therein expressly provided that the court, upon conviction of the accused, may enter judgment in favor of the injured person, against the defendant in the criminal case for the damage occasioned by the wrongful act.\"<br\/><br\/>In Finnick <i>vs<\/i>. Peterson (6 Phil. Rep., 172), it was said:<br\/><blockquote>\"This provision (art. 120, Penal Code) makes it the duty of the court, when the right to personal property is in question in a criminal cause, to order its return to the proper person, after giving all persons interested a hearing, and the Code of Criminal Procedure provided a method for an examination into the question of the right of the property.\"<\/blockquote>In Rakes <i>vs<\/i>. Atlantic, Gulf &amp; Pacific Co. (7 Phil. Rep., 359, 364), it was said:\u00a0 \"According to article 112 (of the Spanish Code of Criminal Procedure) the penal action once started, the civil remedy should be sought therewith, unless it had been waived by the party injured or been expressly reserved by him for civil proceedings for the future.\u00a0 If the civil action alone was prosecuted, arising out of a crime that could be enforced only on private complaint, the penal action thereunder should be extinguished.\"<br\/><br\/>Almeida <i>vs<\/i>. Abaroa (8 Phil. Rep., 17$), was a civil action for damages brought by the plaintiff against a person who had been previously acquitted on a criminal charge.\u00a0 It was held that his acquittal in the criminal action was a complete bar to a civil action for damages based upon the alleged criminal act of which the defendant had been accused.\u00a0 In the course of this decision it was said:<br\/><blockquote>\"Instituting a criminal action only, it will be understood, brings the civil action as well, unless the damaged or prejudiced person waives the same or expressly reserves the right to institute the\u00a0 civil action after the termination of the criminal case, if there be any reason therefor.\u00a0 (Art. 112 of the said Law of Criminal Procedure.)<br\/><br\/>\"The right to bring the civil action, as reserved by the person damaged or prejudiced, after the termination of the criminal case, is only permitted, <i>if there be any reason therefore<\/i>, and so says the law, in the event that the judgment rendered in the criminal cause is a finding of guilt against the accused; but if the accused be acquitted, then the complaint in the civil action must be based on some fact and or cause distinct and separate from the criminal act itself.\"<\/blockquote>The court then quotes from article 114 of the Spanish Code of Criminal Procedure which provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"When a criminal proceeding is instituted for the judicial investigation of a crime or misdemeanor, no civil action arising from the same act can be prosecuted; but the same shall be suspended, if there be one, in whatever stage or state it may be found, until final sentence in the criminal proceeding is pronounced,<br\/><br\/>\"To prosecute a penal action it shall not be necessary that a civil action arising from the same crime or misdemeanor be previously instituted.\"<br\/><br\/>In United States <i>vs<\/i>. Guy-Sayco (13 Phil. Rep., 292), it was said:\u00a0 \"As to the penalty of indemnity contained in the judgment appealed from and impugned by the defense, article 17 of the Code reads:\u00a0 '*\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *;'\u00a0 and according to the established rules of the courts, in order that an accused person may be declared to have incurred civil liability, it is sufficient that said liability shall proceed from, or be the consequence of the criminal liability, and in addition thereto, article 122 of said Code\u00a0 provides that the courts shall regulate the amount of indemnity for damages under said civil liability, upon the same terms\u00a0 as prescribed for the reparation of damage in article 121 of the Code, and a finding on the matter should be contained in the judgment\"<\/blockquote>As a further illustration of the procedure under the Spanish law for determining the civil liability of the accused person, it may not be out of place to revert to the decision of the supreme court of Spain of November 14, 1889.\u00a0 In this case the defendant was indicted for robbery.\u00a0 During the trial, his civil liability was raised by the state's prosecuting attorney, but in rendering judgment of conviction the trial court made no finding on this\u00a0 issue.\u00a0 The state appealed, and the supreme court of Spain held that the court's failure to resolve the civil liability of the defendant was reversible error, and remanded the case with instructions to determine this issue.\u00a0 It will be noted that this was precisely the procedure outlined by this court in the case at bar.<br\/><br\/>Under the Spanish criminal law, an injured person had the right to intervene in the prosecution of the accused for the purpose of having his damages ascertained.\u00a0 The trial court was required to include the amount of these damages in the judgment of conviction.\u00a0\u00a0 The plain\u00a0 provisions of section 107 of our criminal procedure, quoted <i>supra<\/i>, expressly preserves this right to the injured person.\u00a0 The refusal of the trial court to allow the injured person to introduce evidence as to his damages is, therefore, clearly prejudicial error.<br\/><br\/>We will first determine the soundness of the plea of double jeopardy had the lower court not erred in the criminal proceedings by refusing to consider the civil liability of the defendant.\u00a0 Had a finding of civil liability been made upon relevant evidence duly taken, and stated in the judgment of conviction, would there have\u00a0 been double jeopardy?<br\/><br\/>It is true that the connotation of the \"twice in jeopardy\" clause in the Philippine Bill must be found in American jurisprudence.\u00a0 (Kepner <i>vs<\/i>. U. S., 195 U. S., 100; 11 Phil. Rep., 669.)\u00a0 It is also true that this clause refers exclusively to punishment by the state and rendered to the state;\u00a0 that civil liability, as that term is\u00a0 used in the United States, attaches to most crimes and misdemeanors; that, as a general rule, the civil liability of a criminal can not be made an issue in the criminal proceedings, but must be adjudicated and determined in a separate, civil action; that civil liability is due to the person injured and criminal liability to the sovereign; that the criminal proceeding is not a bar to the civil action, or vice versa; and that the twice in jeopardy clause refers only to criminal prosecutions.\u00a0 We take these statements to be axiomatic, and\u00a0 therefore unnecessary of annotation.\u00a0 But we quote from one well considered case, which practically covers all of these propositions:<br\/><blockquote>\"The cases generally hold that the rule in criminal cases, that one shall not twice be put in jeopardy, implies more than the bar of a judgment to an action for the same cause.\u00a0 But no case is known where a conviction upon an indictment has been held a bar to a civil action for damages growing out of the same act; <i>a fortiori<\/i>, none in which a recovery in a civil action has been held a\u00a0 bar to an indictment for the same act.\u00a0 And the whole purview of section 8 plainly shows that the putting in jeopardy prohibited is confined to criminal prosecutions.\u00a0 Indeed, this is manifest in the clause itself, which is confined to the same <i>offense<\/i>, used in the same sense as <i>criminal offense<\/i> in the\u00a0 first clause of the section.\u00a0 Of course the same act may be an offense (in the sense of crime) against the State, and an offense (in the sense of tort) against a private person.\u00a0 It is manifest that judgment for the one is not a bar to the other. And it might be difficult, in principle, to hold a criminal conviction as a bar to the recovery of punitory damages in a civil action, and not a bar to the recovery of compensatory damages; not a bar to any civil action.\u00a0 See Jacks <i>vs<\/i>. Bell, 3 C. &amp; P., 316.\" (Brown <i>vs<\/i>. Swineford, 44 Wis., 282; 28 Am. Rep., 582, per Ryan, C. J.)<\/blockquote>What is the nature of the civil liability imposed upon criminals by the provisions of the Penal Code?\u00a0 If it be the same as the civil liability known to American authorities, then it has nothing to do with criminal liability, and <i>a fortiori<\/i>, can the defense of \"twice in jeopardy\" ever be utilized to prevent its imposition?<br\/><br\/>By article 17 of the Penal Code it is provided that \"Every person criminally liable for a felony or misdemeanor is also civilly liable.\"<br\/><br\/>If it be urged that this is not true under American law, it may be said\u00a0 with equal accuracy that it is not <i>literally<\/i> true under\u00a0 the\u00a0 Penal Code.\u00a0 As stated by both Groizard (vol. 1, p. 697) and Viada (vol. 1, p. 391), there are a number of crimes, such as contempt of court, attempts against the authorities, some of the offenses against religious cults, etc., which are not usually attended with damages to third persons.\u00a0 As stated by the first named commentator, this article must be understood to mean that there is civil liability <i>in those cases where private persons have suffered damages<\/i>.\u00a0 And this will be found to be substantially true in the United States.<br\/><br\/>Under the early common law, damages to a person injured by a crime were merged in the punishment thereof.\u00a0 Later, it was held that there was no merger except in cases of homicide, but that the remedy for the private wrong and injury must be suspended until public justice had been vindicated by\u00a0 the confession or acquittal of the wrongdoer in a criminal prosecution.\u00a0 (1 Cyc, 681.)\u00a0 But by\u00a0 statutory enactments in most jurisdictions, it is now held\u00a0 that the two actions are never merged.\u00a0 (See for instance, N. Y. Ann.\u00a0 Code, sec. 1899, and Mairs <i>vs<\/i>. B. &amp; 0. R. Co., 175 N. Y., 409; La. Stat, 1904, sec. 985.)\u00a0 For. specific crimes where civil liability attaches, see 33 Cyc, 1520, rape; 19 Cyc, 980, arson; 30 Cyc,\u00a0 1578, abortion; 24 Cyc, 802, kidnapping; 3\u00a0 Cyc, 1066,\u00a0 assault and battery; 19 Cyc, 319, false imprisonment; 26 Cyc, 6, malicious prosecution.\u00a0 Although at common law there was no civil liability for seduction, it has been created by statute in most jurisdictions: 35 Cyc, 1294.\u00a0\u00a0 Wrongful death, by statute, now carries with it\u00a0 civil\u00a0 liability: 13 Cyc, 310.\u00a0 Larceny and robbery: 25 Cyc, 55.\u00a0 Generally, in the United States, the owner of stolen\u00a0 property is entitled to have it back\u00a0 irrespective of the conviction of the thief.\u00a0 Identified stolen goods may be recovered even from a bona fide purchaser.\u00a0 Civil actions for debt, replevin, trover and conversion, etc., lie in this class of cases.\u00a0 Malicious prosecution, under the common law only a civil liability, is now, by statute, a criminal offense also: 26 Cyc, 120.\u00a0 But aside from these specific references, it would be sufficient to refer to the subject of torts, which occupies a large field in Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence.\u00a0 In this branch of law, pecuniary damages to the individual for injuries suffered by him are the controlling question, and one of its cardinal principles is that there is no wrong without a remedy.\u00a0 We may safely say, therefore, that civil liability\u00a0 coexists with\u00a0 criminal\u00a0 liability in the United States, the same as it does here.<br\/><br\/>Now, are the elements of civil liability the same in the two countries?\u00a0 Article 119 of the Penal\u00a0 Code reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"The civil liability established in Chapter II, Title II, of this book comprises:<br\/><br\/>\"1. Restitution;<br\/><br\/>\"2. Reparation of\u00a0 the damage\u00a0 caused;<br\/><br\/>\"3. Indemnification for consequential damages.\"<\/blockquote>What are restitution, reparation, and indemnification under this article?\u00a0 Of\u00a0 restitution, there can be no doubt that it exists also in American law.\u00a0 Where property is taken from its rightful owner, it must be restored if found, even though in possession of a bona fide purchaser.\u00a0 Reparation is not so easily\u00a0 recognized.\u00a0 It is treated by both Groizard and Viada as referring to damage caused to property in the commission of crimes such as robbery, as opposed to damages suffered by injuries to the person, as in assaults and homicide.\u00a0 It would appear that Groizard's comment upon this provision is justified when he says that these two elements of civil liability could\u00a0 well have been expressed in a single term.\u00a0 (Vol. 2, 621.)\u00a0 Taken together they are both allowable under the American law of civil liability, and are usually designated without distinction as <i>damages<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>Does the fact that in this country civil liability is, as a rule, determined in the criminal action transform it into criminal liability and thus make it a part of the punishment for the crime?\u00a0 Certainly the mere form of a remedy should not affect its substance.\u00a0 And there are many indications in the Penal Code that the civil liability therein imposed for the commission of crimes was not intended to be merged into the punishment for the crime.\u00a0 Articles 17, 119-126, which provide for civil liability of offenders, are confined strictly to that subject.\u00a0 Article 23 sharply defines one distinction between the criminal and civil liability, in that the former can not be waived by a pardon\u00a0 of the party injured, while the latter may be waived.\u00a0 The chapters of the Penal Code dealing with the classification and duration of penalties (articles 25 to 62 inclusive), nowhere list the civil liability attached to a crime.\u00a0 And article 133 provides that \"Civil liability arising out of crimes or misdemeanors shall be extinguished in the same manner as\u00a0 other obligations, in accordance with the rules of civil law.\"<br\/><br\/>In commenting upon this article, Groizard (vol. 2, p. 717), says:<br\/><blockquote>\"From crimes arise, as we know, two liabilities:\u00a0 criminal and civil.\u00a0 The first is extinguished by the methods to which we have just adverted.\u00a0 The method of terminating the second is not a subject of criminal law, but of civil law.\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>\"The character of this work does not permit us to tarry for further explanations.\u00a0 We would not be commenting upon subjects included within the Penal Code but laws of a purely civil character.\"<\/blockquote>And, as a complement of this article, article 1813 of the Civil Code provides that civil liability attached to crimes may be compromised but that the criminal liability is not thereby extinguished.\u00a0 Other distinctions might be noticed which show that there is no merger of the two kinds of liability from the mere\u00a0 fact that they are tried together.\u00a0 But these are, we think, sufficient to sustain the point<br\/><br\/>There is, therefore, no new or foreign element in civil liability under the Penal Code of this country as compared with civil liability under the American law.\u00a0 We do not consider the practice in the United Sates of allowing punitive or exemplary damages as affecting the question we are discussing.\u00a0 Here as there, civil damages are no part of the punishment for the crime; here as there, they are rendered to the citizen and not to the State.<br\/><br\/>As the civil liability is no part of the punishment for the crime, there would have been no question of double jeopardy, and counsel for the defendant in effect so admits, had the lower court not erred in refusing to consider the question of civil damages during the course of the criminal proceedings.\u00a0 What was the effect of the action of this court in affirming that judgment as to the guilt and punishment of the accused and of reversing it as to the question of civil damages, with instructions to execute the punishment imposed and to try the civil branch of the case?\u00a0 Bearing in mind the broad line of demarkation between the civil liability of the accused and his criminal liability, the bare fact that his civil liability was determined and fixed had nothing whatever to do with the punishment imposed.\u00a0 The latter was not thereby affected.\u00a0 This being true, by what reasoning could it be held that its determination prior or subsequent to the finding of guilt was merged into and became a part of the punishment?\u00a0 If two lines are parallel, they can not converge.\u00a0 This time intervening between the judgment of guilt and the judgment of civil damages could in no way give to the latter the character of the former.<br\/><br\/>It is urged that in such a case as the present, the defendant might serve the term of imprisonment fixed by the court as the punishment for his crime, and after the sentence for civil damages and in case of his insolvency, he would have to return to prison to serve the subsidiary imprisonment by reason of his insolvency,\u00a0 it being argued that this would constitute double jeopardy.\u00a0 Even so it is well settled that execution against the person will issue in civil actions in case of personal injuries, and that this is not imprisonment for debt or <i>punishment for crime<\/i>.\u00a0 It is in lieu of the payment of the indemnity and is considered as a discharge thereof.\u00a0 If the payment of the indemnity is not punishment for the crime, then imprisonment in lieu thereof is not punishment for the crime.<br\/><br\/>The practice, in civil cases, of partially affirming and partially reversing judgments appealed from, is well settled.<br\/><blockquote>\"Where a judgment appealed from\u00a0 consists of distinct and independent\u00a0 matters, so that an erroneous portion thereof can be segregated from the parts that are correct, the court will not set aside the entire judgment, but only so much as is erroneous, leaving the residue undisturbed.\"\u00a0 (3 Cyc, 447.)<\/blockquote>This rule is often applied to cases of tortious\u00a0 wrongs, where the culpability of the\u00a0 tort feasor is established but there has been error in the assessment of damages.\u00a0 (Smith <i>vs<\/i>. Whittlesey, 79 Conn., 189; George <i>vs<\/i>. Railroad, 214 Mo., 551; Austin &amp; McCargar <i>vs<\/i>. Langlois, 83 Vt., 104.)\u00a0 In the present case, the civil liability of the defendant was established, and the sole question determined upon the second trial was the amount of civil\u00a0 damages.\u00a0 The plea of double jeopardy can not be allowed.<br\/><br\/>By their second assignment of error, counsel for the defendant urge that the amount of damages, P50,500 awarded is excessive, and not supported by the evidence.\u00a0 There can be no objection to allowing the physicians fees of P500 arid P1,300 for three months salary, being the time the injured party was incapacitated from performing the work in which he was then engaged.\u00a0 The remainder, P48,700, appears to have been allowed on account of the permanent diminution of Sternberg's ability to earn money.\u00a0 The evidence of record does not establish such disability with that degree of certainty which will justify an award for\u00a0 that purpose.\u00a0 We have reached this conclusion after a most\u00a0 careful examination of all the testimony upon this point.<br\/><br\/>The award of damages is therefore reduced to P1,800, the defendant to suffer subsidiary imprisonment, which in no event can exceed one-third of the principal penalty, in case of insolvency.\u00a0 Costs in this instance <i>de oficio<\/i>.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

G. No. 7767 (10 Off. Gaz., 2102), rendered the following judgment in connection with the appeal of the accused:<br\/><blockquote>\"For the foregoing reasons, the judgment condemning the accused\u00a0 to 1 year and 3 months of <i>prision correccional<\/i> and to the\u00a0 payment of the costs of the cause, is hereby affirmed, and the accused is further sentenced to the accessory penalties provided by law, with costs.\u00a0 Let judgment be entered accordingly.\"<br\/><br\/>As to the appeal of the complaining witness, the court decided that it was well founded, rendering the following judgment:\u00a0 \"It is therefore ordered that the record be returned to the court from whence it came for the execution of the criminal judgment herein affirmed, and for the further purpose of completing the civil branch of the case.\"<\/blockquote>In pursuance of these judgments the cause was returned to the Court of First Instance, the criminal sentence was executed, and the civil branch of the case was continued as required by the judgment of the appellate court, terminating in a judgment in favor of the complaining witness.\u00a0 An appeal was taken by the accused from that judgment and that appeal is the one now before us.<br\/><br\/>In entering upon the consideration of this appeal it should be carefully noted that it is not an appeal from a judgment in an action.\u00a0 It is rather in the nature of an objection made to the execution by the trial court of a mandate of the Supreme Court.\u00a0 The trial court, in dealing with the civil as well as the criminal branch of the case, was simply obeying the judgment of the Supreme Court.\u00a0 Except as to the <i>amount<\/i> of the civil <i>damages<\/i>, the court had no discretion, power, or authority.\u00a0 It could do absolutely nothing except what was authorized by the mandate of the Supreme Court.\u00a0 But it had all power within the mandate-the power of the Supreme Court.\u00a0 So long as it kept within the terms of that mandate neither party could object or interfere in any way.\u00a0 Everything done under that judgment was done under the cover and protection of the mandate of the Supreme Court requiring the execution of its own judgment.<br\/><br\/>I, therefore, say that this is not an appeal from a judgment in an action, in which the usual and ordinary questions connected with such appeals can be raised.\u00a0 As I stated before, it partakes of the nature\u00a0 of an objection to the execution by the trial court of a judgment of the Supreme Court.\u00a0 Quite different results flow from an appeal in its ordinary sense and from the proceedings taken in the present case.\u00a0 I conceive it to be the general doctrine that an appeal from the acts of a trial court done in the\u00a0 execution of a mandate of the Supreme Court will not lie.\u00a0 If one is taken, and it appears to\u00a0 the appellate court on the consideration of that appeal that the trial court has kept within the mandate of the appellate court, the appeal will be dismissed.\u00a0 If it appears that the trial court did not keep within the mandate, the cause will be remanded for the correction of such proceedings as may have been erroneous or for the vacation of such as may have been outside of the terms of the mandate being executed.<br\/><br\/>In the case of Stewart <i>vs<\/i>. Salamon (97 U. S., 361), the court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"An appeal will not be entertained by this court from a decree entered in the circuit or other inferior court, in exact accordance with our mandate upon a previous appeal.\u00a0 Such a decree, when entered, is in effect our decree, and the appeal would be from ourselves to ourselves.\u00a0 If such an appeal is taken, however, we will, upon the application of the appellee, examine the decree entered, and if it conforms to the mandate, dismiss the case with costs.\u00a0 If it does not, the case will be remanded with appropriate directions for the correction of the error.\u00a0 The same rule applies to writs of error.\u00a0 This is not intended to interfere with any remedy the parties may have by mandamus.<br\/><br\/>\"This is an appeal from a decree entered upon our mandate.\u00a0 No complaint is made as to its form, and it seems to be in all respects according to our directions.\u00a0 The effort of the appellant was to open the case below, and to obtain leave to file new pleadings, introducing new defenses.\u00a0 This he could not do.\u00a0 The rights of the parties in the subject matter of the suit were finally determined upon the original appeal, and all that remained for the Circuit Court to do was to enter a decree in accordance with our instructions, and carry it into effect.\u00a0\u00a0 If in the progress of the execution of the decree, after its entry, either party is aggrieved, he may appeal from the final decree in that behalf; but such an appeal will bring up for reexamination only the proceedings subsequent to the mandate.\"<\/blockquote>In the case of Humphrey <i>vs<\/i>. Baker (103 U. S., 736), the court, speaking through Mr. Chief Justice\u00a0 Waite, said:<br\/><blockquote>\"In Stewart <i>vs<\/i>. Salamon (97 U. S., 361), we decided that we would not entertain an appeal from a decree entered in exact accordance with our mandate on a former appeal, and that when such an appeal was taken we would on application examine the decree, and if it conformed to the mandate, dismiss the case with costs.\u00a0 If it did not, we correction of the errors.\u00a0 The decree entered below, in the present case, followed the mandate in\u00a0 every particular and was, in legal effect, ours.\u00a0 It commanded Humphrey\u00a0 to convey, and the proceedings in which the order now appealed from was entered were, for the purpose of compelling him to do what we said must be done.\u00a0 Instead of carrying our decree into execution ourselves, we sent it below for that purpose. No discretion was given the Circuit Court as to\u00a0 requiring a conveyance.\u00a0 That was ordered here.\u00a0 The order appealed from was in furtherance of our express directions, and may with propriety be considered part of our decree.\u00a0 It was the appropriate way of getting the conveyance which we said must be made.\u00a0 If in the end it shall appear that Humphrey is\u00a0 entitled to the relief he asks, in what he denominates his 'bill of supplement and review,' the appropriate decree to that end will be made in that proceeding.\u00a0 The decree we directed is the final decree in the original suit, and the court below had nothing to do but to carry it into execution.\u00a0 Under the rule established in Stewart <i>vs<\/i>. Salamon, therefore, the appeal is dismissed with costs.\"<\/blockquote>In the case of Aspen Mining &amp; Smelting Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Billings (150 U. S., 31), the court said, page 37:<br\/><blockquote>\"Apart from these considerations, however, this is an appeal from a decree entered by the circuit court in conformity with the mandate from the circuit court of appeals for the eighth circuit.\u00a0\u00a0 That court took jurisdiction, passed upon the case, and determined by its judgment that the appeal had been properly taken.\u00a0 If error\u00a0 was committed in so doing, it was not for the circuit court to pass upon that question.\u00a0 The circuit court could not do otherwise than carry out the mandate from the court of appeals, and could not refuse to do so on the ground of want of jurisdiction in itself or in the appellate court.\u00a0 (Skillern's Executors <i>vs<\/i>. May's Executors, 6 Cranch, 267; <i>In re<\/i> Washington &amp; Georgetown\u00a0 Railroad, 140\u00a0 U. S., 91; Gaines <i>vs<\/i>. Rugg, 148 U. S., 228, 241.)\u00a0 And no rule is better settled than that an appeal from a decree entered by the court below in accordance with the mandate of the appellate court, cannot be maintained.\u00a0 (Stewart <i>vs<\/i>. Salamon, 97 U. S., 361; Humphrey <i>vs<\/i>. Baker, 103 U. S., 736; Texas &amp; Pacific Railway <i>vs<\/i>. Anderson, 149 U. S., 237,)\"<\/blockquote>In the case of Texas &amp; Pacific Railway <i>vs<\/i>. Anderson (149 U. S., 237, 242), the court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"Inasmuch as its action conformed to the mandate, and there were no proceedings subsequent thereto not settled by the terms of the mandate itself, the case falls within the rule often\u00a0 heretofore laid down and a second writ of error cannot be maintained.\u00a0 (Cook <i>vs<\/i>. Burnley, 11 Wall., 672, 677; Stewart <i>vs<\/i>. Salamon, 97 U. S., 361; Humphrey <i>vs<\/i>. Baker, 103\u00a0 U. S., 736.)\"<\/blockquote>From these decisions it is clear that no appeal can be taken from any action of the Court of First Instance in this case except such as the court took subsequent to the mandate.<br\/><blockquote>\"If in the progress of the execution of the decree, after its entry, either party is aggrieved, he may appeal from the\" final decree in that behalf; but such an appeal will bring up for reexamination only the proceedings <i>subsequent to the mandate<\/i>.\"\u00a0 (97 U. S., 361.)<\/blockquote>Every question settled by the original decree of this Court was <i>finally<\/i> settled and cannot be made the subject of a new adjudication in any action or\u00a0 proceeding.\u00a0 It is only those questions which are based upon some action of the trial court taken subsequent to the mandate which may be the subject of examination on this appeal.<br\/><br\/>It is clear that, under the Spanish law, the judgment of conviction affirmed by our original decree established the civil liability of the accused conclusively and in a manner which permits of no questioning.\u00a0 There can be no doubting this as the same judgment established finally and unalterably the <i>criminal<\/i> responsibility of the accused, there having been no appeal therefrom; and it being conceded that when the criminal liability is fixed, the civil liability is thereby carried beyond the domain of doubt.<br\/><br\/>The first judgment of the Supreme Court not only settled the civil liability of the accused but it also settled the proposition that the two actions were, at least in part, severable and <i>capable of being separately tried and executed<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>It also settled beyond possibility of doubt the question of former conviction and former jeopardy.\u00a0 When the Supreme Court, in its judgment, declared that the action could be divided and ordered the judgment as to the criminal part executed and the civil part returned for completion, that was an unequivocal declaration that the completion of the civil part would not be a second conviction or a second jeopardy, that the civil judgment would not be a second punishment, and that it was not a part of the criminal penalty.\u00a0 In other words, that decree must be conclusively presumed, unless we now propose to reverse or at least reexamine it, to be a legal and constitutional act of the court-that it did not violate that provision of the Constitution of the United States incorporated in the Philippine Bill which provides that no person shall be twice placed in jeopardy of punishment for the same offense.\u00a0 That decree was never\u00a0 reversed and is not now open to question.\u00a0 That decree is final and is the law.<br\/><br\/>I regard it as evident, therefore, that the only questions that could have been raised below or that can be raised on this appeal are those which relate purely to the civil branch of the case and which were not settled by the judgment of the Supreme Court.\u00a0 Such\u00a0 are the <i>measure<\/i> and <i>amount<\/i> of damage and those arising on such exceptions as were taken on the trial to the rulings of the court on the admissibility of evidence and the like.\u00a0 All other questions are conclusively settled.<br\/><br\/>In spite of all this, however, the\u00a0 court states the questions before it for decision as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"The defendant appealed from this judgment, and by his first, third and fourth assignments of error, raises the question of double jeopardy.\"<br\/><br\/>And\u2014\"We will first determine the soundness of the plea of double jeopardy.\u00a0 Had the lower court not erred in the criminal proceeding by refusing to consider the civil liability of the defendant; had the finding of civil liability been made upon relevant evidence duly taken, and stated in the judgment of conviction, would there have been double jeopardy?\"<br\/><br\/>And\u2014\"Does the fact that in this country civil liability is, as a rule, determined in the criminal action, transform it into a criminal liability, and thus make it a part of the punishment for the crime?\"<\/blockquote>As will be seen from these quotations and from the whole opinion, these are the only questions, apart from the amount of damages, discussed or considered by the court on this appeal.\u00a0 But it is clear from what has already been said that these questions were improperly discussed and decided, as they are questions which\u00a0 were finally determined by the previous judgment of this court and are not now open even to discussion, much less decision.\u00a0 In order to demonstrate the unsoundness of the court's position in holding that these questions are open questions now pending for consideration and decision, let us see what might be the result of it.\u00a0 It is clear that the fact that the court considers these questions open for discussion and decision\u00a0 is an admission that they are open to decision <i>either way<\/i>.\u00a0 In other words, if the question is an open one it is certain that it must be decided as law and justice require.\u00a0 That being the case, let us suppose that the court hold the plea of former jeopardy to be well founded and accordingly reverse the judgment before us and discharge the defendant from civil liability, What would be the situation?\u00a0 In our former judgment we have already held that the trial court could do exactly what it has done.\u00a0 Not only that, we <i>ordered<\/i> it to do it.\u00a0 We sent the former case back to it with the order that it determine the amount of civil damages and that it enter a judgment therefor against the defendant.\u00a0 If we should now hold that it had no right to do so, that to do so would be to violate constitutional rights, what is the result?\u00a0 Necessarily it is a complete reversal\u00a0 of our former judgment and an unequivocal declaration that we had absolutely no authority to order the Court of First Instance to do what we actually ordered it to do, and that we were violating the Constitution of the United States when we made the order.\u00a0 This shows how impossible it is, legally speaking, for this court to consider any of the questions which the court has considered, except the amount of damages.<br\/><br\/>It cannot be too often asserted that this is an appeal from the acts of a court performed in the execution of a mandate of the Supreme Court.\u00a0 This being so, the defendant could not have raised in the court below and cannot raise here any question which was settled by that judgment.\u00a0 As a necessary result the only questions that it was possible to raise in the court below were those which\u00a0 were pertinent to the issues involved in the civil proceeding, namely, those relating to the measure and amount of damages and the introduction of evidence in relation thereto.\u00a0 Even the liability of the accused to pay damages was settled by the original decree and could not have been questioned in these proceedings either below or here.\u00a0 The <i>amount<\/i> was the only question open to the court.<br\/><br\/>Even though it be admitted for the sake of argument that the defendant could have raised the question of former jeopardy in the court below, he did not do so,\u00a0 and, therefore, it is doubtful if he can raise it here for the first time.\u00a0 In making this statement\u00a0 I do not forget the claim made by some authorities that even though the question of former conviction or acquittal, or former jeopardy, is not pleaded in or otherwise brought to the attention of the court below, it can nevertheless be raised in the appellate court provided the record upon which that defense is based is a record of the appellate court.\u00a0 The theory is that such court will take judicial notice of its own records as evidence sustaining the plea and will take up\u00a0 and pass upon the question in the same manner as if the plea had been made and evidence presented in relation thereto in\u00a0 the court below.\u00a0 I do not at this moment express an opinion contrary to that theory.\u00a0 I simply say that, in spite of the advantages which it has, it has many dangers and should be applied with care and caution.\u00a0 Orderly procedure, as established by General Orders No. 58, requires that the plea of former conviction or acquittal, or former jeopardy, shall be <i>specially made on the trial<\/i>.\u00a0 It should be with great hesitation that a court hold those provisions for naught and, to the great surprise of the government, permit the accused suddenly to raise the question for the first time in the appellate court.\u00a0 The right of a court to act upon what is, in point of fact, known\u00a0 to it, should, in some degree at least, be subordinate to those requirements of form and orderly communication which regulate the mode of\u00a0 bringing controversies into court and of stating and conducting them.<br\/><br\/>Section 24 of the Code of Criminal Procedure says:<br\/><blockquote>\"Should the demurrer be disallowed, the court must require the defendant to plead.\u00a0 If he refuses, a plea of not guilty\u00a0 shall be entered for him.<br\/><br\/>\"There are four kinds of pleas to an information or complaint: (1) Guilty; (2) not guilty; (3) a former judgment of conviction or acquittal of the offense charged, which may be pleaded either\u00a0 with or without the\u00a0 plea or not guilty; (4) once in jeopardy, which may be pleaded with or without the plea of not guilty.<br\/><br\/>\"The plea must be oral, and a minute thereof in writing filed with the papers in the case.\"<\/blockquote>If pleas numbered 3 and 4 are not specifically made they are waived.\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Junio, .1 Phil. Rep., 50.)<br\/><br\/>Moreover, the plea should not only be expressly made, but the facts upon which it is based should be clearly proved on the trial.\u00a0 Not only was the plea not made but no evidence whatever was offered or received to substantiate it.\u00a0 Therefore, apart from the results of judicial notice, we have before us upon this appeal neither the plea nor the evidence upon which such plea could be based or by which it could be sustained.\u00a0 The plea of a previous conviction or acquittal or of once in jeopardy is a plea in\u00a0 bar, and, as such, to be available on the trial or elsewhere, should not only be specially pleaded but should be fully proved.<br\/><br\/>Not only was the plea not made and not only was there no effort to prove it, but no question was raised and no suggestion made at the trial which in any manner informed the court or the government that\u00a0 the accused was relying upon the defense of former conviction or once in jeopardy.\u00a0 The trial was begun and continued to the end without objection of any kind and particularly without objection or plea based on former conviction or jeopardy.\u00a0 The court found against the defendant; still nothing was offered or intimated with respect to former conviction or jeopardy.\u00a0 On the contrary, counsel moved for a new trial upon these grounds only :<br\/><blockquote>\"(1) That the decision is contrary to law, and (2) that the decision is contrary to the evidence.\"<\/blockquote>This\u00a0 motion was denied, and the accused filed a notice of appeal.\u00a0 From beginning to end no plea, no evidence, no objection, no suggestion, no thought of former conviction or once in jeopardy.<br\/><br\/>The record being in this condition, I am inclined to believe that this court should not take up and discuss, much less decide, the question of former jeopardy.\u00a0 To do so it must not only hold, in violation of the provisions of section 24 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, that it is unnecessary to plead the defence in the trial court but must also hold that it is unnecessary to introduce\u00a0 evidence in that court to substantiate the plea.\u00a0 The plea of former conviction or once in jeopardy should, according to established rules and the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, be substantiated by the production of the record of the former trial and the introduction of the same in evidence.\u00a0 That was not done in this case.\u00a0 While the <i>evidence<\/i> taken in the former trial was introduced in the present case for the purpose of establishing the extent of defendant's civil liability, the remaining part of the record was not introduced as evidence and was not, therefore, considered by that court.\u00a0 If it had been introduced as evidence, the government would have had the right to meet it and be heard upon it in that\u00a0 court.\u00a0 To permit the question to be raised here for the first time, and, in the resolution thereof, to consider evidence that was never introduced in the trial court and which the government has never had an opportunity to meet in an orderly way, is not only to take the prosecution by surprise but is to establish a precedent which may be dangerous in practice\u00a0 and subversive of orderly procedure.<br\/><br\/>It would seem, therefore, that, under all the facts and circumstances of this case, this court should not permit the appellant to raise here the question of former jeopardy even though it be, for the moment, conceded that he had the right to raise it in the court below.<br\/><br\/>I do not agree with the majority conclusion that any part of the proceedings of the trial court was \"entirely beyond the jurisdiction\" and \"absolutely void,\" and especially\u00a0 not when it restated its former judgment and relaid the foundation of the civil liability of the accused.\u00a0 The trial court changed nothing.\u00a0 It proceeded in precise accordance with the mandate of this court and determined nothing but the amount of damages caused by the criminal acts of the accused.\u00a0 While it may have done some things, strictly speaking, unnecessary to that\u00a0 end, they were not illegal, or unlawful, or void.\u00a0 They disturbed\u00a0 nothing settled by\u00a0 the judgment the court was then executing, and all of those acts tended toward the same result, namely, the execution of the mandate of the Supreme Court.\u00a0 It should be noted that there is no contention anywhere that the court below retried the criminal\u00a0 case.\u00a0 The evidence of guilt was reintroduced, not for the purpose of reconvicting the accused of the crime of which he had already been convicted and sentenced, or of resentencing him therefor, but simply to have appear in the record of that proceeding the foundation of his civil responsibility.\u00a0 The restatement of the judgment was for precisely the same purpose and not to reconvict or resentence the accused.\u00a0 It was simply that there might appear in the record of that proceeding, by formal declaration, the civil liability of the accused.\u00a0 While these acts may have been, strictly speaking, unnecessary, because the civil responsibility had already been established by a final judgment of this court, nevertheless, no prejudice resulted\u00a0 therefrom and they made the proceedings and judgment of the trial court in the civil instance orderly, symmetrical and clear.<br\/><br\/>I do not deem it necessary to consider the question of the amount\u00a0 of damages, as I agree with the court upon the subject; nor the error assigned as No. 4.<br\/><br\/>The cause should be remanded with instructions to enter a judgment against the accused for the sum established by this court with costs. <\/div>",

McElroy.<br\/><br\/>The case was submitted on an agreed statement of facts and the contract entered into on November 25, 1910, by and between the plaintiff and the deceased.\u00a0 The pertinent parts of these documents are as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"It is further stipulated that the assessment work mentioned in said claim has been performed and salary of the watchman therein mentioned has been paid; that the mining property mentioned in the contract was operated for the first year under the terms of the contract, and as a result of such operation the claimant, Mr. Hibberd, suffered a loss, and that it is impossible to operate the property at a profit; that after the expiration of the first year's operation and after ceasing the further development of the property the claimant gave notice to the administrator requesting that they perform their share of the assessment work; but that the administrator refused to perform his share of the assessment work and that no part of the claim for his share of such assessment work has been paid.\"\u00a0 (Stipulation of facts.)<br\/><br\/>\"It is further agreed by and between the parties hereto that the said L. 0. Hibberd shall have the exclusive right to the possession of the said mining claims during the period of one year to commence from date of this instrument and shall have the sole and exclusive right to exploit the same and take all the profits of such exploitation unto himself as his own and exclusive individual property, and for that purpose shall have the right to make use of all the improvements now in and upon any of the above mentioned mining claims.\"\u00a0 (Contract.)<br\/><br\/>\"It is further agreed by and between the parties hereto that if the said J. P. McElroy at the expiration of one year from the date of this instrument should not be in sufficiently good health to be himself upon said claims and assume comanagement thereof with the said L. O. Hibberd, then the said L. O. Hibberd shall continue in the exclusive possession, occupation, management and exploitation of the said mining claims and their improvements and after paying all expenses of the exploitation shall pay one-half of the net proceeds monthly to the said J. P. McElroy.\"\u00a0 (Contract.)<br\/><br\/>\"The said H. 0. Hibberd does hereby bind and obligate himself to do and perform all the assessment work on the said mining claims required under the laws of the Philippine Islands.\"\u00a0 (Contract.)<\/blockquote>The only question raised on the appeal is the interpretation of the contract.\u00a0 Counsel for the administrator contends, and the Court of First Instance has decided, in effect, that the plaintiff is bound to do all of the annual assessment work upon the\u00a0 mining\u00a0 claims mentioned in the contract necessary to secure patents therefor, while counsel for the appellant contends that under the terms of the contract the plaintiff was obligated to perform on his own account only the annual assessment work required for the period of one year.<br\/><br\/>Under the terms of the third paragraph of the contract, McElroy was to assume the comanagement of the property at the end of the first year if the condition of his health permitted, and if not, the plaintiff was to continue in the exclusive\u00a0 possession and management and, after deducting all expenses of the exploitation, to pay over monthly to the said McElroy one-half of the net profits.<br\/><br\/>It is perfectly\u00a0 apparent from the terms of paragraph 3 of the contract that if McElroy had lived and had been in good health, he would have had\u00a0 to go upon the property himself at the end of the first year, and assume the comanagement of the same, thus sharing with the plaintiff the work of the administration and exploitation thereof, which necessarily included the annual assessment work, and it is unreasonable and inequitable to construe the sixth clause of the contract so as to require Hibberd to contribute twice as much labor and money while assuming the burden of the administration on account of the death of McElroy as he would have had to contribute had McElroy been able to perform his share of the labor and management.<br\/><br\/>The only reasonable interpretation that can be placed upon the contract is that it was intended to obligate plaintiff to perform the annual assessment work for the first year unconditionally, and that for any subsequent period during which he might remain in the\u00a0 exclusive possession and management of the property due to the illness or incapacity of his partner, he was to do such annual assessment work as manager without assistance from the coowner only in the event of there being sufficient proceeds from the operation of the property to defray the\u00a0 expenses thereof.\u00a0 If counsel for the appellee and the trial court are correct in their interpretation of the contract to the effect that it obligates the plaintiff to do all of the assessment work on his own account and for an indefinite period of time, then by the same logic the plaintiff would be obligated to continue the exploitation of the mining claims under the terms of the third paragraph of the contract even though the property should not produce a dollar in return for the heavy expenditures necessary to continue its operation.<br\/><br\/>Articles 1283, 1284, and 1285 of the Civil Code provide:<br\/><blockquote>\"However general the terms of the contract may be, there should not be understood as included therein things and cases different from those with regard to which the persons interested intended to contract.<br\/><br\/>\"If any stipulation of a contract should admit of different meanings, it should be understood in the sense most suitable to give it effect.<br\/><br\/>\"The stipulations of a contract should be interpreted in relation to one another, giving to those that are doubtful the meaning which may appear from the consideration of all of them together.\"<\/blockquote>Under section 36 of the Act of Congress of July 1,\u00a0 1902, in order to retain possession of a mining claim the locator or possessor must do assessment work to the value of P200 per annum each year.\u00a0 Under section 37 of the same Act, labor or improvements of the value of P1,000 must be done upon each claim before patent can be obtained therefor.\u00a0 If the judgment of the trial court is correct, then the plaintiff would be obligated to make an outlay in labor or improvements of P10,000 upon the ten claims covered by the contract before he would be relieved from the obligations thereof.\u00a0 It is a principle of law well established that where a specific provision in a contract is followed by a general provision covering the same subject matter, the special provision will be held to prevail over the general provision when the two cannot stand together, but if reasonable effect can be given to both, each is to be retained.<br\/><br\/>In the case of Calvo <i>vs<\/i>. Olives (6 Phil. Rep., 88), the question was one as to the construction of a contract the third paragraph of which was in question.\u00a0 Under the terms of the will of one De la Fuente, all of his property was given to the defendants Angeles, Paz, and Gabriel Olives, subject to a life interest in the usufruct thereof in favor of his widow, Concepcion Calvo, the plaintiff in the case.\u00a0 In the settlement of the estate differences arose between the plaintiff and defendants, and with a view to the adjustment of these differences the contract in question was entered into, the third paragraph of which was as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"The remainder shall be turned over to Concepcion Calvo to be used by her as usufructuary heiress after she has given a mortgage bond.\"<\/blockquote>The court, in interpreting this clause, says:\u00a0 \"Article 1283 of the\u00a0 Civil Code provides:\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 and we are of the opinion that although the word 'remainder' as used in the third paragraph of the said agreement might, in the broadest acceptation of the term, refer to the total balance resulting from the sale of the Escolta property, nevertheless, under the provisions of the foregoing paragraph it should be limited to the subject matter of the agreement and thus limited, it must be taken to refer to the remainder of the share of the inheritance in which Concepcion Calvo had a usufructuary life interest.<br\/><blockquote>\"That this is the correct interpretation of the language used is confirmed by the fact that the paragraph itself expressly provides that the 'remainder' to be turned over to Concepcion Calvo was to be used by her 'as usufructuary heiress,' and it is not contended that she had an interest as usufructuary heiress in more than an undivided one-half interest in this particular property.\"<\/blockquote>In the case at bar, although the words used in the sixth paragraph of the contract require Hibberd to do all the assessment work required\u00a0 by the laws of the Philippine Islands, it will be seen from the first alternative in paragraph 3 that after the first year, McElroy was to assume comanagement, possession, and exploitation of the claims.\u00a0 The words \"possession, management, and exploitation\" are certainly broad enough in meaning to include all and every requisite and thing necessary in connection with the operation and enjoyment of the possession of said claims, and the assessment work required by law to be done on said claims being necessary for the retention by both parties of the possession of the claims, the use of such words by the parties in this contract infixing their obligations after the first year must naturally include the obligation of performing such work thereafter as a joint one, the claims being held by them in common.\u00a0 Under the second alternative, Hibberd was authorized to deduct from the income of the property the expenses of such management and exploitation, the profits remaining to be divided equally between the parties.\u00a0 The assessment work being a necessary requisite to such possession, managament, and exploitation as above pointed out, it\u00a0 follows that an expenditure for that purpose is a proper charge\u00a0 to the expenses of such management.\u00a0 Therefore, under either alternative open to McElroy, it is plain that the intention of the parties was that Hibberd was to do on his own account the assessment work for the first year and that thereafter such work was to be a joint obligation of the parties.\u00a0 This, then, would have the effect of limiting the provision of the sixth clause so as to make it applicable only to the first year after the date of the contract.<br\/><br\/>It appears from the stipulation between the parties that the operation of the claims for the first year by Hibberd, exclusively, resulted in a loss and that said claims cannot be operated at a profit.\u00a0 While it is true the contract does not provide for the liability of the coowners in case of loss in the operation of the\u00a0 property, still, in accordance with article 1689 of the Civil Code, the losses must be shared in the same proportion as the profits.\u00a0 Hibberd has paid the expenses of the assessment work of the second year and there having been no income from the property to reimburse him, he has a right to look to the estate of McElroy for such reimbursement.<br\/><br\/>Article 395 of the Civil Code provides:\u00a0 \"Every coownershall have the right to oblige the participants to contribute to the cost of keeping the thing or right held in common.\u00a0 Only the party renouncing his share in the ownership can exempt himself from this obligation.\"<br\/><br\/>The property mentioned in the contract is listed and claimed as one of the assets of the estate of McElroy and there can, therefore, be no contention that his share in the ownership of the same has been renounced.\u00a0 Before performing the assessment work upon the property after the first year, Hibberd demanded of the administrator of McElroy that he perform his share of such work and the administrator refused.\u00a0 Hibberd was then compelled to do the work in order to retain the property held in common by him and said estate.<br\/><br\/>Section 36 of the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902, providing for the forfeiture of the interest of the coowner who fails to contribute his share of the assessment work is not in conflict with article 395 of the Civil Code, above quoted, and would perhaps not be construed as an exclusive remedy in cases of ordinary coownership resulting from joint location of mining claims, but it is unnecessary to determine that point in this controversy because the contract imposes the duty upon Hibberd to manage and administer the property in the event of McElroy's being unable to assist him and such administration necessarily includes the assessment work.\u00a0 This was clearly intended to be paid out of the proceeds of the operation of the property whether managed by the partners jointly or by Hibberd alone on account of McElroy's inability to participate in the management by reason of illness or death.\u00a0 In default of any proceeds of operation the language of the contract and the law imply a joint obligation to do the annual assessment work as coowners and managers or in the event of the disability or death of McElroy an obligation on his part or that of his administrator to contribute .one-half of the expense which the plaintiff was bound to incur to protect his possession held for the joint benefit of himself and his cotenant in accordance with the terms of article 395, <i>supra<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>The defendant does not contend that section 36 of the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902, is applicable to this case because such a defense would amount in effect to a renunciation of any interest in the claims.\u00a0 The administrator should have renounced all interest in the property at the time demand was made upon him to contribute his share of the assessment work in order to have escaped the absolute obligation imposed upon him by the terms of the contract and the law to reimburse the plaintiff for the estate's share of the expense incurred for the joint benefit of the coowners.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment appealed from, in so far as it disallows the claim of the plaintiff for P1,000 for assessment work on the claims in question, done in behalf of the defendant, is reversed; and it is hereby ordered that this claim against the estate be allowed in full.\u00a0 Otherwise, the judgment is affirmed.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Carson<\/i>, and <i>Moreland, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><\/div>",

Gimenea (24 Phil. Rep., 464), this court said: \"Viada, vol. 2, p. 642, in discussing article 381, says that to constitute the crime of bribery as provided in this article, four things\u00a0 are necessary:\u00a0 (1) That the defendant be a public officer according to the meaning of this term in article 401; (2) that he has received either personally or through another gifts or presents or accepted offers or promises; (3) that such reception of gifts or presents or acceptance of offers or promises has been for the purpose of executing a crime; and (4) that the act constituting the crime relates to the exercise of the office which the public officer discharges.\"<br\/><br\/>The money was not delivered to the two policemen for the purpose\u00a0 of executing a crime.\u00a0 Had Lua been allowed to retain possession of the molasses no law would\u00a0 have been violated, nor would the two policemen have been guilty of a noncompliance with their official duties.\u00a0 Several reasons are advanced as to why the acts of the policemen did not constitute robbery all based upon the misconception of the injured person as to the nature of the substance which he had purchased as opium.\u00a0 It is quite true that had the latter been aware of the true state of affairs he would not have permitted the appellant and his companion to force him to pay them the P150.\u00a0 But the guilt of the appellant is not contingent upon the conception or misconception of Lua as to the true state of affairs.<br\/><br\/>In the case of United States <i>vs.<\/i> Flores (19 Phil. Rep., 178), the court laid down the following doctrine: \"A policeman who, knowing that a person has committed no crime for which he could be lawfully arrested and tried, nevertheless arrests such person, falsely accusing him of a crime, and then by means of threats of presentation and imprisonment, thus\u00a0 playing upon his ignorance and fear, obtains money from the said person, secures such money by force and intimidation and commits the crime of robbery as defined by the Penal Code.\"<br\/><br\/>In the case of United States <i>vs.<\/i> Navarro (18 Phil. Rep., 357), which is practically identical with the case at bar with the exception that the threats and intimidation employed were more serious than those used by the appellant and his companion, it was held that the following facts constituted the crime of robbery:\u00a0 Several persons entered the store of a Chinaman, one of whom pretended to be an internal revenue agent and exhibited a badge.\u00a0 The intruders commenced a search of the store and after a little while pretended to find a small quantity of opium in one of the boxes.\u00a0 The owner of the store was thereupon threatened with arrest, and at the point of revolvers he was ordered to accompany the party to the municipality.\u00a0 At this moment the pretended internal-revenue agent interfered and offered to release the storekeeper if he would pay him P500.\u00a0 The sum of P260 was finally extorted from the Chinaman.<br\/><br\/>The decision of the supreme court of Spain of June 24, 1875, from which a quotation appears in United States <i>vs<\/i>. Flores, cannot be distinguished in principle from the case at bar.\u00a0 It appears that a stranger represented to some villagers that he was a representative\u00a0 of a gang of robbers who had their rendezvous in the mountains and demanded money from them under threats of a visitation from the robbers.\u00a0 His demands were acceded to, and it was held that he was guilty of robbery.\u00a0 In that case the villagers were not aware of the true character of the defendant or they would not have paid tribute to him.<br\/><br\/>The decision of the supreme court of Spain of November 3, 1879,\u00a0 relied upon by counsel for the appellant, is not in point here, for the reason that the person who paid the hush money to the officer of the law in that case was guilty of defrauding the revenues.<br\/><br\/>We are, therefore, of the opinion that\u00a0 the appellant is guilty of the crime of robbery as defined and penalized in paragraph 5 of article 503, in relation with article 502 of the Penal Code, with the aggravating circumstance No. 11 of article 10 of the same Code, and without any extenuating circumstances.\u00a0 He is therefore sentenced to six years ten months and one\u00a0 day of presidio mayor, to indemnify the offended party in the sum of PI50, to the accessory penalties provided by law, and to the payment of the costs of the cause.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Porter Hamilton, an attorney at law, who was practicing his profession in the Court of First Instance of Cebu and in other courts of these Islands, at the time the charges herein set forth were formulated.<br\/><br\/>The charges were filed by the fiscal upon the order of the Honorable Adolph Wislizenus, judge of the Eleventh Judicial District, and the formal accusation sets out four separate counts of professional misconduct, as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"1. The attorney L. Porter Hamilton, being such for the plaintiff Luciano Andrada, in civil cause No. 1344, defended and counseled, without the latter's consent, the defendant Isabelo Alburo in the same matter or business.<br\/><br\/>\"2. The attorney L. Porter Hamilton, having received from the plaintiff Luciano Andrada, in the above-cited case, various documents among which were vouchers or notes signed by some municipal policemen of Cebu and countersigned by the defendant Isabelo Alburo,\u00a0 did\u00a0 maliciously and willfully\u00a0 keep and deny that he\u00a0 had received said documents, for the purpose of thwarting the complaint of Luciano Andrada prepared by himself on said instruments, as he had undertaken the defense of the defendant Isabelo Alburo.<br\/><br\/>\"3. The\u00a0 attorney L. Porter Hamilton, being such in various affairs of Isabelo Alburo, betrayed his client by instigating complaints against the latter, solely in order that his client should entrust him with the defense of said complaints instigated by him.<br\/><br\/>\"4. The attorney L. Porter Hamilton, under date of April 8, 1911, proposed to S. L. Joseph of Cebu that he be employed as attorney for the concern known\u00a0 as the S. L. Joseph Lumber Yard, with a salary of Pl,200 a year, under a threat to compel the said Joseph to accept his proposition.<br\/><br\/>\"Therefore, the fiscal respectfully begs the court to proceed in legal manner to suspend the attorney L. Porter Hamilton from the practice of his profession and to recommend to the Honorable Supreme Court his exclusion from the list of those admitted to practice law in the courts of the Islands.\"<\/blockquote>The defendant answered formally denying the charges, and the cause came on for final hearing before Honorable Jose C. Abreu, acting as a special judge for the trial of this case, on January 22,1912, and upon the proofs adduced, an order of suspension from the practice of law was entered against the defendant, and the case is now before this court for review.<br\/><br\/>By agreement of counsel the case was submitted on briefs, and on the record of the proceedings had in the court below.\u00a0 The only matters which need to be inquired into at this time relate to the conduct of the defendant in\u00a0 civil cause No. 1344 in the Court of First Instance of Cebu, entitled Luciano Andrada <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>. Isabelo Alburo, arid his conduct in addressing to S. L. Joseph the letter referred to under the fourth count of the accusation\u00a0 and\u00a0 filed as Exhibit B for the prosecution, as to both of which matters the court below found the\u00a0 respondent guilty of unprofessional conduct of so grave a character as to justify and require his suspension.<br\/><br\/>It appears from the record that the defendant advised and counseled with one Luciano Andrada in regard to a claim which the latter had against Isabelo Alburo, and that he prepared for Andrada a formal petition which was filed in the office of the clerk of the Court of First Instance of Cebu under the caption \"Luciano Andrada <i>vs<\/i>. Isabelo Alburo, civil case No. 1344;\" and that he also prepared for the plaintiff Andrada in that cause papers relating to attachment proceedings against the property of the defendant, Alburo.\u00a0 The petition as well as the other papers filed with the clerk in this case were signed by the plaintiff, Andrada, who himself delivered them to the clerk.\u00a0 Mr. Hamilton's name was not noted as attorney\u00a0 of record for Andrada.\u00a0 It appears that there was some formal defect in the papers relating to the attachment proceedings, and on September 16, 1911, the defendant Hamilton addressed the following communication to the clerk of the\u00a0 court :<br\/><blockquote><div style=\"text-align: center;\">\"[L.

I.<br\/><br\/>\"SIR:\u00a0 In compliance with the order of this court of this I have the honor to transmit to your possession all the papers, documents, etc., belonging to Sr. Luciano Anin the case of Luciano Andrada, plaintiff, vs. Isabelo defendant, civil cause, No. 1344, and also all of the papers of Sr. Andrada on all other matters which I found in my office.<br\/><br\/>Respectfully,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Sgd.) \"L. PORTER\u00a0 HAMILTON.\"<\/blockquote>Upon the hearing of the disbarment proceedings in the court Luciano Andrada testified that the defendant had advised and counseled with him in regard to his claim against Isabelo Alburo, and that an understanding had been entered into touching the fees to be charged for his services; that the latter was his attorney with respect to this claim, and that as such he delivered to him certain <i>vales<\/i> and papers relating to the claim, and that he was surprised when defendant appeared as attorney for Alburo.<br\/><br\/>The defendant does not offer any satisfactory explanation of his conduct in this matter.\u00a0 He admits that Andrada came to his office and consulted with him regarding this claim against Alburo, and that he prepared the petition and other papers in the case.\u00a0 He insists, however, that he did this solely as a favor to Andrada and that he told Andrada at the time that he could not act as his attorney in the matter.\u00a0 In his brief the defendant states that he refused to\u00a0 appear as the attorney of record for Andrada for two reasons:\u00a0 First, because he failed to secure him his fee, and second, because Senores Martinez and Vamenta were Andrada's regular attorneys at that time.\u00a0 The record clearly establishes, however, that Andrada had no attorney of record in this matter.\u00a0 It is possible that he had consulted other attorneys with reference to his claim against Alburo, but so far as the record shows the defendant is the only person who assumed the relationship of attorney to Andrada.\u00a0 He accepted from\u00a0 him the papers relating to his claim, and to all intents and purposes he was his attorney so far as such relationship could be established by overt acts.\u00a0 He did all that was necessary to establish between himself and Andrada the confidential relationship of attorney and client.\u00a0 He accepted from Andrada such papers as he had relating to the claim against Alburo, papers which, as Andrada testified, disclosed both the strength and the weakness of his claim.\u00a0 He counseled with him regarding the subject matter of the suit and prepared all of the necessary papers for the institution of the litigation, and in fact he rendered all the necessary services of an attorney with reference to the whole matter up to the time of his appearance as attorney for the opposing litigant.\u00a0 The only thing that he had not done was to allow his name to be affixed to the papers filed in the office of the clerk, and this act, far from being to his credit, can only serve as cumulative evidence of the fact that he was not acting in good faith with the man to whom he was rendering professional services.\u00a0 Andrada claims that he was working for a stipulated fee, but it is not necessary to determine here whether or not he had been secured with his fee, or whether he was acting as he claims as a matter of favor to Andrada.\u00a0 He voluntarily assumed the relationship of attorney to Andrada and he received from the latter every confidence that such a relation implies; he assumed the obligation.of preparing the petition and other papers in the case and of expediting the same to the point where an answer was forthcoming from the defendant to the suit; and then without warning to Andrada he entered his appearance as attorney for the defendant and filed a demurrer to the very petition which he had prepared for the plaintiff.\u00a0 At the very time that he appeared for the defendant he had in his possession paper belonging to Andrada which pertained to the litigation and which had been delivered to him as the attorney for the plaintiff, and these were only delivered up at the order of the court.<br\/><br\/>What may have been his motive in this matter we are only left to conjecture, but from every standpoint his conduct was reprehensible in the highest degree.\u00a0 The record clearly establishes the relationship of attorney and client between the defendant and Andrada, and the conduct of defendant was a violation of the confidence which naturally resulted from this relationship.\u00a0 It was a violation of his oath as an attorney and officer of this court, in that he did not offer his services in good faith to his client and failed to serve his client's interest as it was his sworn duty to do.\u00a0 If in serving Andrada in the capacity that he did, he was acting in good faith, and if there had been any reasonable grounds on which he could have justified his transferring his services to the opposing litigant, he should have, and, we take it, he would have, informed Andradaof his intentions and delivered up to him such papers as he had relating to his claim.\u00a0 But without seeking permission from Andrada or the court, and without disclosing his intentions in the matter, he suddenly and unexpectedly, to the surprise of his former client, appeared in opposition to the very suit he had instituted.\u00a0 His whole action in the premises reveals a distorted conception of the ethics of his profession and an utter disregard for his duty and his obligations to both his client and the court.<br\/><br\/>The second charge of professional misconduct against the defendant relates to the following letter addressed by the defendant to Mr. S. L. Joseph, viz:<br\/><blockquote><div style=\"text-align: center;\">\"[L. Porter Hamilton, lawyer, Cebu, Cagayan, and Surigao, P. I.]<br\/><br\/>\"CEBU, CEBU, P. I., <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">April 8, 1911.<\/span><br\/><\/div><br\/>\"Mr. S. L. JOSEPH, <i>Cebu, Cebu<\/i>, P. I.<br\/><br\/>\"Dear Sir:\u00a0 It has been some time since we have had anything to say relative to the proposition of keeping up your collections and looking after your delinquent contract men during your absence in the U. S.\u00a0 What is your opinion relative to the proposition of P1,200 per year, or\u00a0 have you dropped your original idea?<br\/><br\/>\"By the way, I have an offer of P500 to make a thorough investigation into the reason why the Mpl., Prov., and Ins. Govmts. buy so much lumber and so exclusively from the S. L. Joseph Lumber Yard, and P500 more if the investigation brings satisfactory results.<br\/><br\/>\"What do you know about that and what do you think of the proposition?<br\/><br\/>\"Very respectfully,<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: right;\">(Sgd.)\u00a0 \"L. PORTER HAMILTON.\"<\/div><\/blockquote>The lower court in\u00a0 passing upon this letter held that the second paragraph was in the nature of a threat inserted in this letter solely to influence Mr. Joseph in the employment of the defendant in the matter referred to in the first paragraph, and that the defendant in writing such a letter was guilty of such gross professional misconduct as showed him to be unworthy of that esteem and confidence which is necessary in one who aspires to discharge the important functions\u00a0 of an attorney.<br\/><br\/>The defense interposed by defendant to the charge of professional\u00a0 misconduct relating to this letter was that he did not use the language referred to as a threat in any sense, and that it was never so understood by Mr. Joseph; that he had been Mr. Joseph's attorney with reference to other matters and had advised him with reference to the best interests of his business, and that the information imparted in the second paragraph of the letter was simply referred to in an incidental way.\u00a0 It is further contended that the letter in question should have been considered as a <i>privileged\u00a0 communication<\/i>, it having been addressed by him as attorney to his client.\u00a0 Respondent claims that for that reason it is not proper to consider it as evidence in a proceeding of this nature.<br\/><br\/>The letter is self-explanatory and needs but little comment from the court.\u00a0 A careful examination of the language used by the defendant in the second paragraph of this letter discloses that the defendant does not say that he will not accept such employment, or that he refused to accept such employment.\u00a0 The only reasonable interpretation that the language\u00a0 conveys is that he has the matter under advisement and that he is holding his final decision in abeyance.\u00a0 It is further quite evident from the context of the first paragraph of the letter that Mr.Joseph had apparently dropped the question of employing defendant with reference to the matter proposed, and that defendant was anxious that he take the matter up for further consideration.\u00a0 No reasonable explanation was given for the incorporation of the second paragraph in this particular letter, nor does any reason suggest itself, unless it be that it was inserted there as a threat.\u00a0 Following as, it does immediately upon the solicitation for employment, the reasonable and logical interpretation which it bears is that it was used as a threat to induce Mr. Joseph to give favorable consideration to the proposition advanced in the first paragraph of the letter. This was the conclusion of the trial court and it is also our conclusion.<br\/><br\/>The contention that this letter is a privileged communication is not tenable.\u00a0 The general rule is well recognized that professional communications are privileged, but that statements made by a client to his attorney, or the statements of an attorney to his client fall within this rule only when it is shown that the relation of attorney and client existed with reference to the matter to which the communication relates.\u00a0 (23 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 58.)\u00a0 Furthermore, in a proceeding of this nature, where the alleged client himself is not insisting on the privilege, counsel can not be permitted to shield himself behind the privilege.<br\/><br\/>The context of the whole letter in the present case shows conclusively that no such relation existed with reference to the subject matter of the letter.\u00a0 The defendant was soliciting employment, and this very fact is evidence that the relation of attorney and client did not exist.\u00a0 As to the second paragraph of the letter we can not accept the contention that this information was imparted as professional advice.<br\/><br\/>After a very careful examination of the whole record we have regretfully reached the conclusion that the facts before us show a flagrant and willful violation on the part of defendant of his professional obligations, and a reckless disregard of the fundamental ethics of his profession.<br\/><br\/>We have encountered some difficulty in determining whether the name of the defendant in these proceedings should be permanently stricken from the roll, or whether, under all the circumstances, an order suspending him for a substantial period would sufficiently subserve the interests of justice, and of the administration of justice in these Islands.<br\/><br\/>Under the provisions of the Spanish Penal Code (art. 357) an attorney found guilty of the unprofessional conduct of which, as appears from the record in these proceedings, this defendant was guilty is liable to suffer the penalty of temporary special disqualification, that is to say, disqualification for a period of from six years and one day to twelve years; and after some hesitation we have concluded that the suspension of the defendant for a period of six years will secure the ends for which these proceedings were instituted.\u00a0 It is true, of course, that, as was said by Mr. Justice Hooker, <i>In re<\/i> Shepard (109 Mich. 631).<br\/><br\/>\"This is not a proceeding by way of punishment, though the deprivation of the privileges of an attorney may be a matter of serious importance to a practitioner.\u00a0 It is a measure necessary to the protection of the public, who have a right to expect that courts will be vigilant in withholding, and, if already given, withdrawing, their certificates of qualification and character, upon which the public rely.\"<br\/><br\/>But in determining the question whether the defendant should be suspended or permanently disbarred, it would seem proper to have in mind the provisions of the statute fixing the penalty to be imposed in the event that a criminal action had been instituted against the defendant.<br\/><br\/>Let the proper orders be entered suspending the defendant in these proceedings from the practice of law for a period of six years from the date of his original suspension in the court below, with the costs of these proceedings against him.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

or whether he was more or less negligent by depositing the money in his personal account than he would have been if he had deposited it in a separate account as trustee.\u00a0 We regard such discussion as\u00a0 substantially fruitless, inasmuch as the precise question is not one of negligence.\u00a0 There was no law prohibiting him from depositing it as he did and there was no law which changed his responsibility by reason\u00a0 of the deposit.\u00a0 While it may be true that one who is under obligation to do or give a thing is in duty bound, when he sees events approaching the results of which will be dangerous to his trust, to take all reasonable means and measures to escape or, if unavoidable, to temper the effects of those events, we do not feel constrained to hold that, in choosing between two means equally legal, he is culpably negligent in selecting one whereas he would not have been if he had selected the other.<br\/><br\/>The court, therefore, finds and declares that the money which is the subject matter of this action was deposited by Father De la Pe\u00f1a in the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation of Iloilo; that said money was forcibly taken from the bank by the armed forces of the United Sates during the war of the insurrection; and that said Father De la Pe\u00f1a was not responsible for its loss.\u00a0 The judgment is therefore reversed, and it is decreed that the plaintiff shall take nothing by his complaint.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres<\/i> and <i>Carson, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><br\/><br\/><hr align=\"CENTER\" noshade=\"NOSHADE\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">DISSENTING<\/span><br\/><\/div><br\/><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">TRENT, J.,<\/span><br\/><br\/>I dissent.\u00a0 Technically speaking, whether Father De la Pe\u00f1a was a trustee or an agent of the plaintiff his books showed that in 1898 he had in his possession as trustee or agent the sum of P6,641 belonging to the plaintiff as the head of the church.\u00a0 This money was then clothed with all the immunities and protection with which the law seeks to invest trust funds.\u00a0 But when De la Pe\u00f1a mixed this trust fund with his own and deposited the whole in the bank to his <i>personal<\/i> account or credit, he by this act stamped on the said fund his own private marks and unclothed it of all the protection it had.\u00a0 If this money had been deposited in the name of De la Pe\u00f1a as trustee or agent of the plaintiff, I think that it may be presumed that the military authorities would not have confiscated it for the reason that they were looking for insurgent funds only.\u00a0 Again, the plaintiff had no reason to suppose that De la Pe\u00f1a would attempt to strip the fund of its identity, nor had he said or done anything which tended to relieve De la Pe\u00f1a from the legal responsibility which pertains to the care and custody of trust funds.<br\/><br\/>The Supreme Court of the United States in United States <i>vs<\/i>. Thomas (82 U. S., 337), at page 343, said:\u00a0 \"Trustees are only bound to exercise the same care and solicitude with regard to the trust property which they would exercise with regard to their own.\u00a0 Equity will not exact more of them.\u00a0 They are not liable for a loss by theft without their fault.\u00a0 But this exemption ceases when they mix the trust-money with their own, whereby it loses its identity, and they become mere debtors.\"<br\/><br\/>If this proposition is sound and is applicable to cases arising in\u00a0 this jurisdiction, and I entertain no doubt on this point, the liability of the estate of De la Pe\u00f1a cannot be doubted.\u00a0 But this court in the majority opinion says:\u00a0 \"The fact that he (Agustin de la Pe\u00f1a) placed the <i>trust<\/i> fund in the bank in his <i>personal account<\/i> does not add to his responsibility.\u00a0 Such deposit did not make him a debtor who must respond at all hazards.\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 There was no law prohibiting him from depositing it as he\u00a0 did, and there was no law which changed his responsibility, by reason of the deposit.\"<br\/><br\/>I assume that the court in using the language which appears in the\u00a0 latter part of the above quotation meant to say that there was no statutory law regulating the question.\u00a0 Questions of this character are not usually governed by statutory law.\u00a0 The law is to be found in the very nature of the trust itself, and, as a general rule, the courts say what facts are necessary to hold the trustee as a debtor.<br\/><br\/>If De la Pe\u00f1a, after depositing the trust fund in his personal account, had used this money for speculative purposes, such as the buying and selling of sugar or other products of the country, thereby becoming a debtor, there would have been no doubt as to the liability of his estate.\u00a0 Whether he used this money for that purpose the record is silent, but it will be noted that a considerable length of time intervened from the time of the deposit until the funds were confiscated by the military authorities.\u00a0 In fact the record shows that De la Pe\u00f1a deposited on June 27, 1898, P5,259, on June 28 of that year P3,280, and on August 5 of the same year P6,000.\u00a0 The record also shows that these funds were withdrawn and again deposited all together on the 29th of May, 1900, this last deposit amounting to P18.970.\u00a0 These facts strongly indicate that De la Pe\u00f1a had as a matter of fact been using the money in violation of the trust imposed in him.<br\/><br\/>If the doctrine announced in the majority opinion be followed in cases hereafter arising in this jurisdiction trust funds will be placed in a precarious condition.\u00a0 The position of the trustee will cease to be one of trust.<\/div>",

MATEO ANTONIO FELIX, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">This is an appeal raised, through a bill of exceptions, from the judgment of May 26, 1911, whereby the Honorable A. S. Crossfield, judge, dismissed the complaint, without finding as to costs.<br\/><br\/>By a writing of May 5, 1908, counsel for the plaintiffs filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance of this city, alleging that prior to the month of April, 1905, a company known as <i>La Protectora<\/i> was organized in Tondo by and between Tomas Cabangis, Antonio Valencia, Juan Lazaro, and the plaintiffs Simplicio Santos, Modesto Santos, Francisco Icasiano, Perfecto Santisteban, the defendant Mateo Antonio Felix, and Jose Flor Mata, for the purpose of conducting on a large scale the business of the purchase and sale of fresh fish in the <i>sitio<\/i> of Bancusay; that the cashier of the company was Antonio Felix until the 22d of April of that year, when the company was dissolved, the stockholders Cabangis, Valencia, and Lazaro withdrawing their capital and there remaining only Simplicio Santos, Modesto Santos, Francisco Icasiano, Perfecto Santisteban, and Mateo Antonio Felix, who continued the business by organizing another new company, the cashier of which, from the 24th of April, was the aforesaid Mateo Antonio Felix, which joint stock company, established in Tondo, a district of this city, for the purpose of buying and selling fresh fish in Bancusay and receiving consignments of fresh fish for sale, was called <i>La Consignataria<\/i> and was organized on October 8, 1905, with a capital of P4,400 distributed in the following manner: P900 among Simplicio Santos, Modesto Santos, and Mateo A. Felix; Jose Flor Mata, P500; Perfecto Santisteban, P500; Andrea A. Felix, P500; Francisco Icasiano, P500; Trinidad Icasiano, P500; Alipio Icasiano, P500; and Ambrosio Delgado, P500; that, on the very day of the organization of the company <i>La Consignataria<\/i>, all the members thereof by unanimous vote confirmed Mateo A. Felix in the position of cashier, who, after accepting the same, continued to discharge the duties of his office by paying for the fish purchased and after its sale securing through collectors and on receipt the value of the fish sold, by disbursing on the days designated the weekly shares of the profits among the members of the company, by paying the. expenses of the concern and by advancing money, when required, to the company's customers and members; that, on January 17, 1907, on account of increase of business, the company then in existence was changed into one of joint stock, under the name of <i>Los Obreros<\/i>, and two more members were admitted, Nicolas Gatdula, who brought in no capital whatever, wherefore he was given no share, and Jose Santiago, who brought in Pl,000, which change was no hindrance to the increase day by day of the company's business; that, on August 3, 1907, the members requested that the company's accounts be balanced and the cash on hand be counted, which, on being done, showed that during the period comprised between April 24, 1905, and August 3, 1907, the cashier, Mateo A. Felix, according to the receipts issued by him to his collectors, had received from the latter the net sum of P582,488.28, which together with the value of eleven shares of stock representing the sum of P5,400, made an aggregate amount of P587,888.28 as funds' turned into the company; that, upon balancing the payments made and expenses incurred, with the debts of the members and others, it was found that they amounted to the net sum of P561,621.42, which result did not satisfy the plaintiffs, because of the lack of vouchers; that, upon deducting the said expenditures of P561,621.42 from the receipts of P587,888.28, there appeared a difference of P26,266.86, which should be the amount of the cash on hand after the balance struck on August 3, 1907; that the plaintiffs, being satisfied with the good results obtained in the business, demanded that the cashier, the defendant Mateo A. Felix, count the cash in his keeping, but that the latter, instead of so doing, turned over to the new cashier, Modesto Santos, the sum of P190.60\" as the cash on hand and a receipt for a loan of P400 made to Jose Flor Mata; that when the plaintiffs demanded an explanation from the said Mateo Felix with respect to the disappearance of the sum of P25,676.26, the net balance obtained by a deduction of the aforesaid sums of P190.60 in cash and P400 given as a loan, the defendant requested that he be allowed a certain period of time for the purpose of checking up his balance sheet or in order to make a new one; that, although this delay and others were allowed the defendant, he did not account for the disappearance of the said funds or capital stock of the company, wherefore it became necessary to appeal to the courts; and that it was the defendant's duty, according to the by laws, to keep the company's funds and count the same every Saturday, which he did not do, although the faithful performance of his duties was guaranteed by a bond, to wit, by a lien on his house, situated at Nos. 131 to 135 Calle Ilaya, Tondo.\u00a0 Therefore, plaintiffs' said counsel asked that judgment be rendered in his clients' behalf ordering the defendant to return to the company the amount misappropriated, P25,676.26, for partition among the members, and that, should he fail so to do, the defendant's said house be sold as well as such other property of his as might be necessary in order to cover the said sum and interest thereon at 10 per cent per annum, as the average income on capital employed in the fish business, from August 3, 1907, until final judgment; and furthermore, that he be sentenced to pay the costs.<br\/><br\/>The defendant's demurrer to the complaint having been overruled, he made in \"his answer a general and specific denial of each and all of the facts alleged in the complaint and of each and all the paragraphs thereof, and, as a special defense, alleged that an employee of the plaintiffs, taking advantage of the defendant's ignorance of bookkeeping and of Spanish, induced him on a certain occasion by surprise and deceit to sign some documents, the scope and meaning of which he could not suspect and which subsequently were invoked as the foundation and grounds for such exorbitant claims as those made in this suit, which documents the defendant would impugn in due season; that, as a counterclaim, he set forth that, for the purpose of furthering with greater interest and zeal the business of the purchase and sale of fish, in which he was a partner with the plaintiffs, he had on several occasions contributed various sums from his own personal funds, and that, as a result of such advances of money, the plaintiffs owed him the sum of P1,769.21; and he prayed for any other relief proper under the law.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the plaintiffs, in view of the defendant's aforesaid answer and counterclaim, denied, by a writing of September 15, 1908, each and all of the facts specified in the said counterclaim and alleged in his clients' defense that the defendant, during the time he held the office of cashier of the said company, had never reported at any meeting of the members that he had made any advances of money to the company out of his own private funds.\u00a0 Said counsel therefore argued that the defendant was not entitled to the relief sought by him, and asked that he be sentenced as requested in the complaint.<br\/><br\/>The case was heard on August 12, 1909, evidence was introduced by both parties, and the court, on October 3, 1910, rendered judgment sentencing the defendant to pay to the plaintiffs the sum of P25,676.26, together with legal interest thereon from the date of the filing of the complaint, and to pay the costs of the trial, and absolving the plaintiffs from the counterclaim made by the defendant.<br\/><br\/>In virtue of the motion for a rehearing, made by the defendant's counsel, and in spite of the plaintiffs' objections, the court by an order of November 12, 1910, granted a new trial.<br\/><br\/>The case having been reopened and the evidence requested by the defendant party having been introduced, the court, on May 26, 1911, rendered the judgment aforementioned, exception to which was taken by the plaintiffs' counsel, who asked for reversal of the said judgment and the holding of a new trial.\u00a0 This motion was overruled by an order of June 10, 1911, with exception thereto by counsel for the plaintiffs, and the proper bill of exceptions having been presented, the same was approved and forwarded to the clerk of this court.<br\/><br\/>From a careful examination of the record of this case, including the bill of exceptions and the briefs filed by both parties, the first question which stands out before any other for determination by this court is whether, on account of the appellant's having made no assignment whatever of any error the trial judge may have incurred in the judgment appealed from, the court should or should not dismiss the pending appeal which, by reason of such defect, is in fact understood legally to be abandoned, inasmuch as this court cannot review the judgment appealed from, since no error expressly specified by the appellant has been attributed thereto.<br\/><br\/>The first part of rule 19 of the rules of this Supreme Court is as follows: \"Prefixed to the brief of the appellant, but stated separately, shall be an assignment of errors intended to be urged. Each specification of error shall be separately, distinctly, and concisely stated without repetition, and they shall be numbered consecutively.\"<br\/><br\/>Rule 20 prescribes:\u00a0 \"No error not affecting the jurisdiction over the subject matter will be considered unless stated in the assignment of errors and relied upon in the brief.\"<br\/><br\/>These provisions of the rules of this court, which are supplementary to the procedural law, have not been observed or complied with by the appellants in their brief, for attached to the end thereof is a sheet whereon appears as the only assignment of error the trial judge has incurred the following:<br\/><br\/>\"The Court of First Instance of this city incurred error in rendering the judgment appealed from, for it is contrary to law and the weight of the evidence.\"<br\/><br\/>This same statement was made in their written petition to the trial judge for setting aside the judgment and a rehearing in the Court of First Instance; but it is unquestionable that they have not thereby complied with the foregoing provisions of the rules, inasmuch as they have not expressly specified what error the judge incurred by holding in his judgment that the plaintiff appellants have not proved any cause of action against the defendant, wherefore the complaint against the latter had to be dismissed.<br\/><br\/>It is a rule enunciated in various decisions of this court, and which by its repeated and uniform application has now become a well-established principle, that if in an appeal the appellant fails to make an assignment of the errors which the lower court may have incurred, and merely discusses questions of fact in general, it is not possible for this court to consider or review findings adverse to the appellant, on the ground that they are contrary to law and the weight of the evidence; but the error or errors upon which the judgment appealed from, qualified as illegal and unjust, is based, must be pointed out and specified.\u00a0 (Enriquez <i>vs<\/i>. Enriquez, 8 Phil. Rep., 565; Capellania de Tambobong <i>vs<\/i>. Antonio, 8 Phil. Rep., 683; Paterno <i>vs<\/i>. City of Manila, 17 Phil. Rep., 26.)\u00a0 The same legal doctrine is followed in the courts of the United States of North America, as a general statement that the court erred in rendering judgment in behalf of one of the parties is not sufficient as a basis to enable the Supreme Court to review the judgment appealed from, for the reason that the assignment of errors should specifically set forth those complained of by the appellant.\u00a0 Unless the findings of the court below with respect to the facts alleged and proved at the trial are manifestly contrary to the evidence, the appellate court usually accepts the opinion of the trial judge on the questions of fact and does not reverse the judgment appealed from.\u00a0 Such procedure has become established by repeated decisions of this court.<br\/><br\/>Although the judgment appealed from must of course be affirmed because of the defect of the appellants' not having presented a statement of errors, still this court proceeded with an examination of the result and merits in the record, for the purpose of ascertaining whether the plaintiffs had or had not succeeded in proving the facts alleged in their complaint and the responsibility attributed to the defendant, Mateo Antonio Felix, because of his alleged misappropriation of capital and profits belonging to the company, to the grave prejudice of the members thereof, and also whether the defendant was able to justify his procedure and the exceptions which he, also, alleged in his defense.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiffs, in their endeavor to establish, as it was proper that they should, the misappropriation alleged to have been committed by the defendant as cashier of the company successively denominated <i>La Protectora<\/i>, <i>La Consignataria,<\/i> and <i>Los Obreros Pescadores<\/i> exhibited as proof of their averments and allegations the documents designated as Exhibits A, B, C, and D, pp. 5 to 7, and the testimony of the bookkeeper, Rafael V. Abellana, from all of which, as well as from the various books produced during the hearing of the case, it is concluded that the plaintiffs have not succeeded in proving satisfactorily the facts alleged in the complaint, but, on the contrary, the evidence adduced by the very plaintiffs themselves, taken as a whole, shows that there is a balance of more than P1,000 due the cashier charged with misappropriation.<br\/><br\/>In the complaint payment is demanded of the sum of P25,676.26, for which it is claimed the defendant, Mateo A. Felix, is liable, with interest thereon at the rate of 10 per cent per annum, and yet in the objection made by means of Exhibit C to the accounts contained in Exhibit B-documentary evidence presented on page 7 by the attorney for the plaintiffs and by one of the latter at the time the bookkeeper Rafael V. Abellana, a witness for the said plaintiffs, was testifying-there appears the statement, under note No. 36 of the said Exhibit C, that, although the defendant was found to owe the considerable sum of more than P32,000, the company claimed only P3,623.14, which was the amount of the deficit shown to exist by the account prepared by the said bookkeeper, who drew up the said Exhibit C.<br\/><br\/>The record discloses no satisfactory explanation as to why, while the sum of P25,676.26 is demanded in the complaint, the account Exhibit C nevertheless shows a debit balance of P32,189.77, and notwithstanding which it is stated in the note at the end of the same account that the company demands from the defendant as a deficit only the small sum of P3,623.14.\u00a0 If the defendant really owes but this minor sum, it is not understood how the plaintiff members of the company, relying as they must have done upon documentary evidence, should nevertheless have demanded in their complaint the considerable amount of P25,676.26.\u00a0 This disagreement between the complaint and the result derived from the evidence adduced in its support virtually proves that conclusive proof of the facts alleged in the complaint is really lacking in the record for the courts to have sentenced the defendant to the payment of the debt claimed; for if the documentary evidence presented at the trial is insufficient, the oral testimony in the ease seems even to have an opposite effect, as does the testimony of the principal witness for the plaintiffs, the company's bookkeeper, in view of the contradictions and divergencies apparent therein.<br\/><br\/>As a result of a careful study and examination of the accounts, in themselves deficient, jumbled, and confused, which were kept from April 24, 1905, until August 3, 1907, when the defendant ceased to hold his position of cashier of the company, the following: balance sheet has been made:<br\/><blockquote><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" width=\"100%\"> <tbody><tr valign=\"top\"> <td width=\"80%\">Proceeds from the sale of fish, from April to May, 1905, according to Nos. 1 and 2 of the account, Exhibit C... <\/td> <td width=\"20%\"><div align=\"right\">P7,294.64<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>Proceeds from the sale of fish, from October, 1906, to August 3, 1907, according to No. 3 of the account, Exhibit\u00a0 C........................................... <\/td> <td><div align=\"right\"><br\/> 606,793.11<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>\u00a0<\/td> <td><div align=\"right\">__________<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>Total................................................<\/td> <td><div align=\"right\">614,087.95<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>\u00a0<\/td> <td><div align=\"right\">=========<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>\u00a0<\/td> <td><div align=\"right\"><\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>Value of the furniture, warehouse, bancas, and amount of taxes, etc., according to Nos. 13 to 25 of Exhibit C. ........................................................<\/td> <td><div align=\"right\"><br\/> 1,891.20<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>Debts of members, admitted in No. 26 of Exhibit G, as recorded in the company's journal and ledger..................................................<\/td> <td><div align=\"right\"><br\/> 7,784.89<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>Accounts pending in the hands of the collectors, as shown by the journal and the ledger..................................................<\/td> <td><div align=\"right\">8,456.48<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>Payments on consignments, according to item 33 of Exhibit C .............................................<\/td> <td><div align=\"right\">10,079.77<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>Payments made on consignments, according to No, 34 of Exhibit C and the testimony of the bookkeeper, a witness for the plaintiffs, found on pages 18 to 19, 91, 92 of the record oi oral testimony.............................................<\/td> <td><div align=\"right\"><br\/> 572,598.70<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>Total amount of the due bills, admitted in Exhibit C, according to Nos. 27 to 81 thereof......................<\/td> <td><div align=\"right\">1,847.21<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>Cash on hand..............................................<\/td> <td><div align=\"right\">190.60<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>Dividends to members of the company, as recorded in the ledger.............................................<\/td> <td><div align=\"right\">12,441.01<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>\u00a0<\/td> <td><div align=\"right\">__________<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>Total ................................................<\/td> <td><div align=\"right\">616,289.86<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>\u00a0<\/td> <td><div align=\"right\">=========<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>Debit................................................<\/td> <td><div align=\"right\">614,087.95<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>Credit...............................................<\/td> <td><div align=\"right\">615,289.86<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>\u00a0<\/td> <td><div align=\"right\">__________<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>Balance in favor of thedefendant.........................<\/td> <td><div align=\"right\">1,201.91<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <\/tbody><\/table><\/blockquote>In this balance sheet the capital stock is not included, for whatever the sum brought by each of the members into the common fund, it is certain that, from the time the company began operations, the sums on hand were, without any reservation whatever, invested in the purchase of fish, aside from the amounts employed in furniture, warehouse, boats, and other effects for the use of the company; therefore, in the sum of the proceeds from the sale of fish, the sole business of the company, there is comprised the amount of the capital stock separate from the value of the warehouse, boats, furniture, etc., and consequently in the sum of the proceeds from the business the capital stock is really included, for, were this not so, the latter would be counted twice as a charge against the defendant, unless the amount of the said stock were excluded from the total sum of the proceeds from the sale of fish.<br\/><br\/>For a like reason, neither would it be just to charge the defendant with the sum of P33,170.95 paid by Perfecto Santisteban in the course of the company's transactions, without crediting the defendant with the same amount, since Santisteban, during the time that he substituted the latter in the position of cashier, must have made such disbursements out of the company funds which the defendant had on hand, for neither Santisteban nor the plaintiffs have proved that the latter made those payments out of his own private funds, while it is to be believed that, considering the nature of the business of the purchase and sale of fish, its operations were conducted by the company's buying the fish for cash from' various fishermen and afterwards selling it to others for cash or on credit, in such manner that the proceeds from such sales, collected at the time or later by the collectors from those who took the fish on credit, were immediately employed in the acquisition or purchase of other fish for subsequent resale, and so on each day, so that the amounts gathered and collected from the sales were successively invested in the acquisition and purchase of fish, in order to continue the company's business in the manner stated.<br\/><br\/>The nature and character of the company concerned in the pending litigation does not appear to have been discussed at the trial; and therefore this decision shall not determine whether it is mercantile or civil.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the balance of P1,2O1.91 in favor of the defendant, as disclosed in the balance of accounts hereinbefore given, although it is to be believed that the same was paid by the defendant out of his own private funds, yet, in view of the fact that he kept no cashbook and has not proved that he paid out such amount, the petition in his counterclaim must, also, be denied.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, and the judgment appealed from having been found to be in accord with the law and the evidence, it should be, as it is hereby, affirmed, with the costs in this instance against the plaintiffs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

and that when he declined to do so the accused, who carried a dagger, threatened him with death if he would reveal anything that had been said.\u00a0 This witness was corroborated\u00a0 by another who swore that on the 10th of January, 1912, the accused accompanied by Dungca went to the storehouse of Hizon and there talked with Sanchez, though this witness could not testify as to the subject of the conversation.\u00a0 Two other witnesses testified that some time after 7 o'clock on the night of January 10, 1912, they went to the deceased Chinaman's store to buy wine, and there saw three persons leaning on the table, one of whom was the accused.\u00a0 These witnesses also testified that about 8 o'clock on\u00a0 the same night they passed by the store and saw three persons, one of whom was the accused, leaving the store, in which the lights had been put out, and closing the door behind them.\u00a0 Two other witnesses testified that they passed the store about 8 o'clock on the night of January 10, 1912, and that they saw the accused holding the Chinaman by the arms and heard the Chinaman crying \"guapelo,\" which was shown to be a Chinese expression of distress or fear.\u00a0 Another witness, who lived about 50 meters from the store of the deceased, testified that he observed that the store was closed and the lights extinguished not long after 8 o'clock on the night of January 10, 1912, and that it continued closed until the night of the 12th, when the local officials entered and found the dead body of the Chinaman.<br\/><br\/>Testifying in his own behalf, the accused set up an alibi, alleging\u00a0 that he had passed the night in question in the house of one Catalina in the town of Angeles.\u00a0 The prosecution introduced evidence to show that at the time of his arrest the accused\u00a0 informed the arresting officers that he had spent the night in Dau; that an investigation having been made and it appearing that the accused had not in fact been in Dau upon the night in question, the accused then stated that he had spent the night in Angeles.\u00a0 The defense failed utterly to sustain the alibi set up on behalf of the accused, and indeed the woman Catalina flatly contradicted the statement:\u00a0 of the accused in this connection.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for appellant lays considerable stress upon the inherent improbability of the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution, especially those who testified that they saw the accused holding the Chinaman by his arms and heard the Chinaman crying out in distress.\u00a0 These witnesses also testified that although they\u00a0 saw the incident they passed on without paying any attention and had no further knowledge as to what occurred.\u00a0 Counsel for the accused insists that it is impossible to believe that natural curiosity would not have induced them to stop and see the rest of the quarrel had they in fact seen as much of it as they claim to have seen.\u00a0 Counsel for the accused also point to some apparent differences between the impression of the foot of the accused as made in ink and the bloody footprint on the brick floor of the store of the deceased Chinaman.\u00a0 Photographs of the bloody footprint and of the impression of the foot made in ink are included in the record, and while both are sufficiently distinct to justify the acceptance of the evidence as to the size, we doubt if the impression of the bloody\u00a0 footprint is clear enough to treat it as\u00a0 an absolute identification of the accused.\u00a0 At the same time the very slight differences in form to which attention is directed by counsel for the appellant may well be accounted for by the fact that in one instance the bloody footprint may have been made while the accused was in motion, while the impression in ink was taken while he was standing still.<br\/><br\/>It may be admitted that the testimony of the two witnesses who claim to have seen the accused holding the deceased at the precise hour at which the crime appears from the other evidence in the record to have been committed is not wholly satisfactory, but we think that even if this evidence be rejected, the testimony as to the proposition made by the accused to one of the witnesses to join him in robbing the Chinaman, and the testimony showing that the accused with two others was in the store about the time when the crime must have been committed and left it with his companions after the lights had been extinguished, taken together with the proof as to the identity in length and breadth of his foot with that of the bloody footprint found in the store, leaves no reasonable doubt as to his guilt.\u00a0 This conclusion is confirmed by the evidence which tends almost conclusively to establish the falsity of the alibi which he undertook to set up in his own defense.<br\/><br\/>The trial court properly acquitted\u00a0 the defendant of the crime of assassination with which he was charged, because of the lack of evidence upon which to base a finding as to the existence of any of the qualifying circumstances necessary to raise the degree of guilt of the accused from that of homicide to assassination.\u00a0 We think, however, that the trial court should have found the existence of one aggravating circumstance, in that the crime was committed in the house of the deceased.\u00a0 The penalty should have been imposed in the maximum degree, that is to say, from seventeen years four months and one day to twenty years of <i>reclusion temporal.<\/i><br\/><br\/>The judgment of conviction by the trial court is affirmed, but the sentence should be modified by sustituting for so much thereof as imposes the penalty of fourteen years eight months and one day of\u00a0 <i>reclusion temporal<\/i> the penalty of twenty years of <i>reclusion temporal<\/i>, and thus modified the sentence imposed by the trial court should be and is hereby affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Subsequently thereto (the exact time not alleged in the complaint) the consignee discovered that 42 barrels had been broken open and about half of the cement in each barrel lost, and it is alleged that this loss was due to the careless handling on the part of the defendant's agents.\u00a0 There is no allegation in the complaint showing that either the plaintiff or the consignee or anyone else representing them made any complaint or demand on the defendant company at any time prior to the presentation of this complaint, which was filed on February 18, 1911, to be reimbursed for the loss of the cement.<br\/><br\/>Articles 866 and 952 of the Code of Commerce read:<br\/><blockquote>\"Art. 366.\u00a0 Within the twenty-four hours following, the receipt of the merchandise a claim may be brought against the carrier on account of damage or average found therein on opening the packages, provided that the indications of the damage or average giving rise to the claim cannot be ascertained from the exterior of said packages, in which case said claim would only be admitted on the receipt of the packages.<br\/><br\/>\"After the periods mentioned have elapsed, or after the transportation charges have been paid, no claim whatsoever shall be admitted against the carrier with regard to the condition in which the goods transported were delivered.<br\/><br\/>\"Art. 952.\u00a0 The following (actions) shall prescribe after one year:<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"2.

Such actions must be brought within the periods therein set forth after the right of action accrues.<br\/><br\/>The first paragraph of clause No. 2 of article 952 of the Code of Commerce relates to the same matter as that covered by section 43 of Act No. 190, and may properly be said to have been repealed by said section 43.\u00a0 Article 366 and the last paragraph of clause No. 2 of article 952 of the Code of Commerce do not relate to the prescription or limitation of actions.\u00a0 They create conditions precedent to the accruing of the right of action against carriers for damages caused to merchandise, and have not been repealed by section 43.<br\/><blockquote>\"If the plaintiff's right of action depends upon a condition precedent, he must allege and prove the fulfillment of the condition or a legal excuse for its nonfulfillment.\u00a0 And if he omits such allegation his declaration, complaint, or petition will be bad on demurrer.\" (9 Cyc, 699, and cases cited.)<\/blockquote>It is urged that section 67, <i>supra<\/i>, changes the rules of law applicable to the liability of carriers of merchandise belonging to the Government.\u00a0 A careful examination of this section will show that it has made no change whatever in the existing law except with respect to the liability of the consignee as an officer or agent of the Government.\u00a0 The section first appeared as section 23 of Act No. 215 under the heading of \"Transportation of Property,\" the title of that Act being \"An Act establishing, and regulating accountability for public property in the Philippine Archipelago.\"\u00a0 The Act as a whole relates solely to the liability of officers of the Government by reason of the possession of Government funds and other property.\u00a0 This Act, including the section in question, went through a series of amendments until the section was finally inserted in its present form in the Accounting Act as section 67, <i>supra<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>It is quite clear from a reading of this section (section 67 of Act No. 1792) that the only part which can by any possibility be construed as affecting the liability of common carriers is that which follows the word \"Provided.\"\u00a0 All the rest of the section in terms relates to the liability of the consignee, The latter part, of this section makes the carrier liable for any shortage in any package of public property or any damage thereto upon proof of the opening or tampering with such package, and when a notation is made upon the bill of lading or receipt of such evidence, the burden of proof that the shortage or damage occurred after the shipment left the carrier's possession is upon the carrier.<br\/><br\/>Before the passage of Act No. 1792, evidence of the \"opening\" of a package or \"tampering\" with the goods delivered to him for transportation made the carrier liable for the loss, provided the required notice was given in time.\u00a0 And when the fact that the packages in which goods have been received showed evidence of having been opened or tampered with at the time of delivery, and this fact was noted upon the bill,of lading, the burden rested upon the carrier to show that, although the package may have been broken at the time of delivery, the contents were intact.\u00a0 This being so, the mere repetition in the Act or section of a part of the existing law on the subject of the liability of common carriers cannot be construed so as to have the effect of repealing by implication the unrepealed parts of that law in the absence of a clear intention on the part of the Legislature to effect such repeal.\u00a0 In other words, the statement that an annotation of the receipt of goods in bad condition on the bill of lading throws the burden of proof on the carrier to show that they were in fact intact and in good condition at the time of delivery does involve as a necessary corollary the proposition that when the goods are received and receipted for as being in <i>good<\/i> condition, that the shipper can bring an action against the carrier at any time within the ten years allowed by section 43 of Act No. 190, within which to sue on an obligation arising from a contract in writing and recover upon proof that the goods, although receipted for as being in good condition, were really received in bad condition.\u00a0 The whole purpose of the law according to the Code of Commerce is to give the carrier an opportunity to ascertain whether the claim is a well-founded one before the goods leave his hands with respect to damages which are observable upon the exterior of the goods or of the packages in which they are contained, and before the goods have been consumed or their identity destroyed in cases in which it is alleged that the damage has been discovered after the goods were received by the consignee.\u00a0 To impose upon the carrier the liability which plaintiff seeks to impose by his action would be to make the business of a common Carrier a most hazardous one so hazardous, indeed, that carriers would be obliged to charge much higher rates for carrying goods belonging to the Government than for carrying goods belonging to other persons not entitled to any such exemption from the general provisions of law relating to rights and liabilities of shippers and carriers as is here claimed on behalf of this plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the question insisted upon by the plaintiff that article 366 of the Code of Commerce is not applicable to maritime transportation, it is sufficient to say that this court has decided this point in the case of Cordoba <i>vs<\/i>.\u00a0 Warner, Barnes &amp; Co. (1 Phil. Rep., 7) adversely to the contention of the plaintiff.\u00a0 We now see no reason for changing the doctrine announced in that case.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons the order appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

United States (164 U. S., 492) appellant assigned as error the following instruction given to the jury by the trial judge:<br\/><br\/>Now, then, you consider his conduct at the time of the killing and his conduct afterwards.\u00a0 If he fled, if he left the country, if he\u00a0 sought to avoid arrest, that is a fact that should be taken into consideration against him, because the law says unless it is satisfactorily explained\u2014and he may explain it upon some theory, and you are to say whether there is any effort to explain it in this case\u2014if it is unexplained the law says it is a fact that may be taken into account against the party charged with the crime of murder upon the theory that I have named, upon the existence of this monitor called conscience that teaches us to know whether we have done right or wrong in a given case.\"<br\/><br\/>In discussing this assignment of error the Supreme Court of the United States said:<br\/><blockquote>\"In the case of Hickory <i>vs<\/i>. United States (160 U. S., 408, 422), where the same question, as to the weight to be given to flight as evidence of guilt, arose, the court charged the jury that 'the law recognizes another proposition as true, and it is that \"the wicked flee, when no man pursueth, but the innocent are bold as a lion.\"\u00a0 That is a self-evident proposition that has been recognized so often by mankind that we can take it as an axiom and apply it to this case.'\u00a0 It was held that this was error, and was tantamount to saying to the jury that flight created a legal presumption of guilt, so strong and conclusive, that it was the duty of the jury to act on it as an axiomatic truth.\u00a0 So, also, in the case of Alberty <i>vs<\/i>. United States (162 U. S., 499, 509), the court used the same language, and added that from the fact of absconding the jury might infer the fact of guilt, and that flight was a silent admission by the\u00a0 defendant that he was unwilling or unable to face the case against him, and was in some sense feeble or strong, as the case might be, a confession.\u00a0 This was also held to be\u00a0 error.\u00a0 But in neither of these cases was it intimated that the flight of the accused was not a circumstance proper to be laid before the jury as having a tendency to prove his guilt.\u00a0 Several authorities were quoted in the Hickory case (p.\u00a0 417), as tending to establish this proposition.\u00a0 Indeed, the law is entirely well settled that the flight of the accused is competent evidence against him as having a tendency to\u00a0 establish his guilt.\u00a0 (Whart. on Homicide, par. 710; People <i>vs<\/i>. Pitcher, 15 Michigan, 397.)<br\/><br\/>\"This was the substance of the above instruction, and although not accurate in all its parts we do not think it could have\u00a0 misled the jury.\"<\/blockquote>We find no error in the\u00a0 proceedings prejudicial to the rights of the accused, and the judgment of conviction and the sentence imposed by the trial court should therefore be affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

and the defendant as a creditor with a preference under article 1600 as well as under subdivision 1 of said article 1922.\u00a0 Having settled the question as to the provisions of the Civil Code to which the parties must look in the determination of their rights, the court then states that the question before it consists \"in determining whether a creditor who alleges a preference has the right to litigate the amount of his adversary's credit in spite of the fact that the amount of said credit had been fixed in a judgment obtained in a cause in which he was not a party.\"\u00a0 The court found that, in spite of the fact that both Mantel and Bachrach, the parties in this action, had each previously secured a judgment against Aldecoa, the one for the value of the repairs and the other for the purchase price of the machines themselves, the parties in this action could litigate, as between themselves, the value of the repairs, and that the court was competent to determine what that value was, notwithstanding the existence of the previous judgment upon that question.\u00a0 Proceeding to a determination of the cause the court found, as we have already noted, that the defendant was entitled to recover upon his\u00a0 counterclaim and that, as to that credit, he had a preference over the plaintiff in the proceeds of the sale of the two automobiles, which had been sold by virtue of the foreclosure of the chattel mortgage by\u00a0 the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>Without discussing the method or the steps by which the court arrived at the result in this case (and no question relative thereto has been raised by either party), we proceed\u00a0 to a determination of the questions raised on this appeal.<br\/><br\/>From the facts in this case it appears unquestioned that automobile No. 57 was delivered to the defendant for repair with the full knowledge, authority, and consent of the mortgagee, the plaintiff.\u00a0 Plaintiff had his place of business next door to that of the defendant and was fully aware of the fact that Mantel was repairing the machine in question.\u00a0 In fact, the record shows that the plaintiff himself brought the machine in question from the Para\u00f1aque road where the accident occurred to the defendant's workshop, and, during the course of the repairs, went in, from time to time, and counseled with the defendant as to the character of the repairs necessary, noted the progress made and advised him to go forward with the work.\u00a0 He not only made no objection to these repairs, but he approved them and the way in which they were being\u00a0 made.\u00a0\u00a0 When the automobile was delivered\u00a0 to the defendant for\u00a0 repair it was generally considered to be substantially unfit for anything but the scrap heap.\u00a0 In this condition it represented no security for the mortgage which plaintiff held on it.\u00a0 It cannot be denied that it was, very largely, the labor and materials furnished by the defendant that gave the machine the value, P1,000, which the plaintiff received\u00a0 for it at the foreclosure sale.<br\/><br\/>Much stress is laid\u00a0 by the plaintiff upon the case of Meyers <i>vs<\/i>.\u00a0 Thein (15 Phil. Rep.,\u00a0 303).\u00a0 That case dealt with a chattel mortgage from the viewpoint of the Civil Code respecting preference of creditors, treating the mortgagee as a creditor with a pledge.\u00a0 Chattel mortgages have another aspect, however, and one from which their real nature more clearly appears.\u00a0 Under the Chattel Mortgage Law the mortgagee becomes the owner of the property in the sense that he has the legal title, the mortgagor having the right to retain possession, to have the beneficial use, and to defeat the title of the mortgagee by compliance with the terms of the mortgage.\u00a0 In a sense, the mortgagee is the legal,\u00a0 the mortgagor the equitable owner.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff having the legal title to the property, and having himself brought the machine to the defendant for repairs, and having himself requested and urged the prosecution of such repairs, became personally liable to pay for them.<br\/><br\/>No question has been raised here relative to the effect, if any, of the prior judgments obtained by the parties against Aldecoa, and we therefore do not touch that subject.\u00a0 The judgment appealed\u00a0 from is affirmed, with costs.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Isidora Ventura directed to the Court of Land Registration, having for its object the modification of the decree of registration of the title to certain\u00a0 lands described in the motion so that the title shall be registered in the name of said Isidora Ventura.<br\/><br\/>On the 17th of October, 1908, Isidora Ventura made a donation of the lands in dispute in this action in favor of her grandchildren Aurea Consuelo, Filomena Natividad, Leonarda Concepcion, and Paz Romana, all surnamed Felix, reserving to herself the life use of said premises, she to be responsible for all taxes and ordinary repairs during the time of her occupation.\u00a0 On the same day and within the same instrument the donation was accepted by the recipients thereof.\u00a0 On the 18th of December of the same year the said Isidora Ventura, notwithstanding the donation which had become effective theretofore in favor of her grandchildren, sold the said lands to Ines Feliciano, reserving to herself the right to repurchase the same.\u00a0 On the 30th of June, 1909, a proceeding having been commenced by Isidora Ventura to register the title to said lands, decree was entered therein registering the title in her name, subject to an incumbrance of P1,400 in favor of Concepcion Enriquez, and subject also to the sale with a right to repurchase hereinabove mentioned.\u00a0 Before that decree became final a motion was made for the revision thereof praying that it be vacated and that a new decree be issued registering the title in the name of those to whom said Isidora Ventura had\u00a0 made the donation.\u00a0 To this motion Isidora Ventura gave her full and free consent and in pursuance thereof the original decree was vacated and a new decree made and entered registering the title to the lands described therein in the name of the donees.<br\/><br\/>The 18th of December, 1910, being the last day upon which the repurchase could be made by virtue of the terms of the sale with a right to repurchase made between Isidora Ventura and Ines Feliciano, said Isidora Ventura on the 9th of that month paid to Ines Feliciano the sum required by said instrument for the redemption of the lands described therein.\u00a0 Upon receiving payment said Ines Feliciano executed in favor of Isidora Ventura a resale of the premises described in the sale with a right to repurchase, which was duly acknowledged before a notary public on the 18th of February, 1911.\u00a0 Said instrument was presented to the registrar of\u00a0 titles for registration under the Torrens Law.\u00a0 Registration thereof was refused and this proceeding was brought.<br\/><br\/>Isidora Ventura pretended in the court below and pretends on this appeal that she is the absolute owner of the lands in litigation by virtue of having redeemed them from the sale which she had made to Ines Feliciano and that she is entitled to have the instrument of resale registered under the Torrens system and a declaration of title in her favor.<br\/><br\/>The learned Court of Land Registration disapproved of this contention and refused the remedy prayed for.<br\/><br\/>We are clearly of the opinion that the Court of Land Registration correctly decided the case.\u00a0 Isidora Ventura having made in due and legal form a donation of her lands to the donees mentioned in the instrument, and said donation having been duly accepted in accordance with law, title to the lands donated passed immediately to the donees subject to the reserved life interest of the donor.\u00a0\u00a0 From that time forward Isidora Ventura had no interest in the lands other than that of a life tenant.\u00a0 She had no power to make an absolute sale of the lands in question and, therefore, the sale with a right to repurchase executed in favor of Ines Feliciano on December 18, 1908, was an act wholly beyond her\u00a0 power and conveyed nothing, so far as the donees were concerned, to Ines Feliciano.<br\/><br\/>Nor did the fact that a decree in the Court of Land Registration was issued in favor of Isidora Ventura registering title to said lands in her name confer any permanent rights or interests.\u00a0 That decree before becoming final was vacated and set aside and another decree substituted in its place wherein and whereby the title to the lands described therein was registered in the name of the rightful owners.\u00a0 No benefits could be claimed, therefore, under the original decree either by Isidora Ventura or by her alleged vendee Ines Feliciano.\u00a0 When, therefore, on the 9th of December, 1910, Isidora Ventura paid to Ines Feliciano\u00a0 the purchase price of the lands as provided in their contract of sale with a right to repurchase, she accomplished nothing more than the payment of a personal debt which she owed, the payment of which in nowise affected the lands in litigation.\u00a0 The title to such lands was not in Ines Feliciano nor did she have any interests therein by virtue\u00a0 of the sale with a right to repurchase executed in her favor by Isidora Ventura.\u00a0 As a necessary consequence, the instrument of resale executed by Ines Feliciano in favor of Isidora Ventura was without force or effect so far as the title to the premises therein described was concerned.\u00a0 Having no title or interest therein, she could convey or reconvey none to Isidora Ventura.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the appellant in this instance.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

that the debt to secure the payment of which the instrument had been made was not paid within the time required therein; that, by reason thereof the purchaser became the absolute owner of the premises described therein; and that, as such owner, he was entitled, under section 80 and the following sections of the Code of Civil Procedure, to prosecute the proceeding of unlawful detention.<br\/><br\/>The petitioner for the writ appealed from the judgment of the justice of the peace, asserting in the appellate court-that the justice of the peace had no jurisdiction to try the action upon the ground that the relations between the parties under the instrument in question were not such as came within the purview of the act relating to forcible entry and detainer.\u00a0 This contention\u00a0 was overruled by the appellate court which found that the instrument in question constituted a sale with a right to repurchase, that, being such, it created relations which fell within the meaning of section 80 and succeeding sections of the Code of Civil Procedure; that the justice's court, therefore, had jurisdiction; and for these reasons affirmed the judgment of that court.<br\/><br\/>The contention of the petitioner is, that the justice of the peace had no jurisdiction of the\u00a0 action for the reason that the relations between the parties thereto created\u00a0 by the instrument in question were not such as fall within the purview of the act relating to forcible entry and detainer; and that the justice of peace having no jurisdiction of the subject matter of the action, the Court of First Instance, on the appeal, had no jurisdiction further than to set aside and annul the void judgment of the justice's court.<br\/><br\/>We are of the opinion that the contention of petitioner is well founded.\u00a0 The pertinent part of the instrument which is the basis of the proceeding and which was the foundation of the two judgments attacked is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"That in consideration of the sum of P927.36, which amount we hereby declare that we have received to our entire satisfaction from Mariano Santero, Valentin Toledo, and Mercedes Tibayan, with the consent and approbation of the husband, Baldomero San Juan, the said Mariano Santero, Valentin Toledo, and Mercedes Tibayan being our joint creditors, that part of said sum corresponding to the first being P550.01 and the second P218 and to the third P159.35; we hereby transfer to said Mariano Santero, Valentin Toledo, and Mercedes Tibayan, to their heirs and assigns, as pledge or security in the nature of a <i>pacto de retro,<\/i> our rights in and to the land of the Pasay Estate Company and our property\u00a0 rights above described, obligating ourselves to our said creditors, their heirs and assigns, to warrant and defend title thereto; and if on or before the 31st day of December of the present year 1912 we do not exercise the right to repurchase, the said creditors, their heirs and assigns, shall become absolute owners of the rights and properties above described, the said pledge or security shall be canceled and this document shall have the force and effect of an absolute sale with all the rights and prerogatives which the law gives to a completed sale.\"<\/blockquote>This instrument is typical of the contract of sale with a right to repurchase.\u00a0 Fundamentally these instruments are executed for the purpose of securing the payment of a debt already existing or one at the moment created.\u00a0 They are in real essence and at bottom a security.\u00a0 While not a mortgage or pledge, they have, from the point of view of the parties, the same general\u00a0 purpose.\u00a0 They secure the payment of a debt.\u00a0 They have the advantage over the mortgage of allowing the borrower to obtain a larger sum than he could obtain upon a mortgage and of permitting the lender to make the instrument effective without trouble or expense.\u00a0 While in a mortgage the mortgagee secures title only after action, in a <i>pacto de retro<\/i> he secures title by mere lapse of time and by operation of law.\u00a0 The mortgage is never a sale, but the <i>pacto de retro<\/i> is, from its inception, under the repeated decisions of this court, a sale subject to defeasance and, at the last, a sale absolute.<br\/><br\/>In every case where there has been a controversy in this court growing out of a sale with a right to repurchase the question of title has been necessarily\u00a0 at issue.\u00a0 This is because the question of title is the only one that can be raised.\u00a0 In these cases it is contended either that the instrument constitutes a mortgage only or that the payments stipulated therein have not been made.\u00a0 Usually it is contended that the instrument is not a sale with a right to repurchase, but is a mortgage instead.\u00a0 The resolution of that question requires, of course, an interpretation of the instrument.\u00a0 If it is a sale with a right to repurchase, the question then arises as to performance.\u00a0 If the time within which the payment is to be\u00a0 made has expired, the title has become irrevocable in the vendee and he is entitled to immediate possession.\u00a0 On the other hand, if the instrument is a mortgage, or if the payment required by the instrument has been made, or if there has been a tender of payment, or if the vendor has tried in good faith to make the payment required by the contract and has been prevented from so doing by some act of the vendee, then the title has not become absolute and the vendor is entitled to retain possession.\u00a0 In other words, in all of these cases the question of title necessarily arises one way or the other.\u00a0 Until the instrument has been defined by interpretation no one knows where the title to the premises is; and if the instrument be found to be a sale with right to repurchase, still no one knows where the title is until the questions revolving around the fact of payment have been settled.\u00a0 Both of these questions affect title, and a bona fide\u00a0 dispute as to either of them will raise the question of title in such a way and to such an extent that it must be one of the necessary determinations of the court trying the cause.<br\/><br\/>This is a typical case of a sale with right to repurchase as they come to this court, and the typical questions presented in such case are raised herein.\u00a0 It is claimed by the vendor that the instrument is a mortgage and not a sale with a right to repurchase; that she has paid the amount of the indebtedness within the time required by the terms of the document, and that she is therefore the owner of the premises and entitled, by virtue of such ownership, to retain possession thereof.\u00a0 The vendees, on the other hand, assert that the instrument is not a mortgage but a sale with a right to repurchase; that the time stipulated in the instrument within which payment must be made has expired and that no such payment has been made or tendered; that by virtue of that fact they have become absolute and sole owners of the premises, and, by virtue of such ownership, are entitled to the immediate possession thereof.\u00a0 It is, therefore, clear that the question to be determined in this case is primarily the question of ownership, for upon\u00a0 ownership, pure and simple, depends the right to possession.\u00a0 It is equally clear that the justice's court, therefore, had no jurisdiction of the subject matter of the action and that, as a necessary consequence, the Court of First Instance on appeal had no jurisdiction further than to set aside and annul the judgment entered in the justice's court.<br\/><br\/>While these observations are sufficient to dispose of the case before us, we may still reach the same conclusion by repeating the\u00a0 statement which we made at the outset, namely, that the contract known as a sale with right to repurchase does not, under any circumstances, create such a relation as falls within the purview of section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure; and that, therefore, the contention that it is such a sale as to make the vendor and the vendee therein the same kind of a vendor and a vendee mentioned in section 80 is unsustainable.\u00a0 It is our opinion that, in enacting section 80, it was the intention of the Legislature to give the justice of the peace jurisdiction of actions of unlawful detainer based upon sales only in those cases where the sale is admitted and the ownership cannot, therefore, in the nature of things, be disputed.\u00a0 This is necessarily so, for, if the sale itself is disputed\u2014that is, if an attempt is made to take from the\u00a0 parties the quality and relation of vendor and vendee\u2014there is presented instantly the question of ownership; and the right to possession resting wholly upon the fact of sale, such right must wait and be dependent upon the determination of that question.\u00a0 Whether there was really a sale or not and whether the parties take on the qualities of vendor and vendee are matters which go to the very essence of title.\u00a0 But when the question of title necessarily arises the justice's court loses jurisdiction.\u00a0 It is, therefore, apparent that the cases included within the definition of the sale specified in section 80 are only those in which the question of whether or not there <i>was<\/i> a sale, that is to say, as to who owns the property, cannot arise.\u00a0 This is true as to the other cases described in section 80.\u00a0 No question of title can arise where possession has been obtained by force, intimidation, threat, strategy or stealth, or where there is a lease.\u00a0 There is not a case mentioned in section 80 in which the title to the property can come in question.\u00a0 If it does arise and its determination is necessary for\u00a0 a resolution of the cause, then instantly the case is taken from the domain of section 80 and the justice's court loses jurisdiction.\u00a0 Perhaps it were better said, and more nearly correctly, that the case was never within the section.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, we say that the conditional sale, which is created by the contract known as a sale with a right to repurchase, is not such a sale and\u00a0 does not create such a relation as is defined by section 80.\u00a0 It is a conditional sale made as security for a debt.\u00a0\u00a0 If any controversy at all arises over such a contract, it is necessarily one which involves the title to the land in suit.\u00a0 Does the controversy arise over the interpretation of the instrument, that\u00a0 is, as to whether it is a mortgage or a sale with a defeasance?\u00a0 If so, then the question of title arises and must be decided:\u00a0 for if the instrument is a mortgage the title never passed, whereas it did pass if the instrument was a sale with the right to repurchase.\u00a0 Does the question arise over the payment of the sum named in the instrument within the time therein required?\u00a0 If so, the question of title arises because the sale becomes absolute in favor of the vendee only in case there has been a failure of payment, and the vendor becomes again the absolute owner if there has been a payment.\u00a0 Thus, the determination of the question of payment is at the same time a determination of the question of ownership.\u00a0 It is apparent, from what has been said, that the vendee, in ousting the vendor from the possession of the premises after the failure to fulfil the contract, must do so upon the rights inherent in ownership.\u00a0 Under the contract he has no other rights on which he can base the claim to possession.\u00a0 In the same way the vendor must maintain his right to possession on the theory that he is the absolute owner.\u00a0 He has no other rights in which he can found his continued occupation.\u00a0 From whatever point of view we look, therefore, there cannot arise\u00a0 a contested case relative to a contract of sale with a right to repurchase which falls within section 80; and for that reason the action begun by the vendee to recover possession against the vendor, under said instrument, cannot be within the jurisdiction of a justice's court as that jurisdiction is now defined.\u00a0 The action is one in ejectment.\u00a0 This was true under Spanish law and it is true under the present law.<br\/><br\/>For these reasons we are of the opinion that the judgment of the justice of the peace was entered without jurisdiction and is therefore of no force or effect.\u00a0 The judgment of affirmance by the Court of First Instance adds nothing to it.\u00a0 If it was without effect before, it was after.\u00a0 We do not at this time enter into a discussion of the right of the Court of First Instance to dismiss the appeal and at the same time affirm the judgment appealed from.\u00a0\u00a0 If an appeal is dismissed, that terminates the matter before the court, and a judgment of affirmance entered at the same time the appeal is dismissed is inconsistent with the act of dismissal.<br\/><br\/>The complaint states a cause of action, if we may so speak, in certiorari with respect to the judgment of the justice's court.\u00a0 As to the judgment of the Court of First Instance, we think that nothing need be said inasmuch as, the judgment of the justice of the peace being void, the affirmance by the Court of First Instance made it no less so.\u00a0 The annullment of the justice's court is all that is necessary to put the plaintiffs in the proceeding at bar in a position where the matter in dispute between the parties may be settled in an original action.in the\u00a0 Court of First Instance.<br\/><br\/>The return made to the order to show cause is insufficient in law.\u00a0\u00a0 It appearing, however, that all the pertinent parts of the record in the court\u00a0 below are now before us, and the whole case having been considered, we find it unnecessary to require the elevation of the record.<br\/><br\/>The judgments of the justice of the peace and of the Court of First Instance are hereby annulled, with the costs against the defendants.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

and therefore the certainty of said contract and the consolidation of the vendees' ownership are prima facie and at a glance fully proven, because the property was not repurchased by the vendor within the period stipulated between the parties.<br\/><br\/>The circumstance that the vendor remained in possession of the land sold does not affect or invalidate the character and attributes of the contract; and after the sale had once been consummated by lapse of the period for the repurchase, and the ownership of the vendee in said property consolidated, he is entitled to recover it, for there is no reason whereby the vendor, who is\u00a0 no longer the owner thereof, may unduly retain it.<br\/><br\/>I see no difference between the right of a vendee in an absolute sale and that of the vendee with right of repurchase after his ownership has been consolidated; and if the former is entitled under said section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure to ask for restitution of his property in the justice of the peace court, why cannot the latter exercise the same right in the same justice of the peace court, being clothed with the same character of owner, and after his ownership has been consolidated having exactly the same status as the vendee in an absolute sale?\u00a0 Some legal provision must be shown to establish the difference and to prevent him from exercising his right under the law.<br\/><br\/>Retention of the property sold with right of repurchase is equivalent to usurpation committed by a vendor who has alienated his property absolutely and unconditionally, and that of the tenant who unjustifiably continues to occupy the leased property to the prejudice of the owner, for when the ownership of a vendee with\u00a0 right of repurchase has been consolidated, he is in the same situation and has the same qualifications as the vendee in an absolute sale or the owner of leased property.\u00a0 The contract whence arises the right of the vendees, the present defendants, their qualifications, the price and the time for the resale have been duly proven by a notarial instrument not impugned or show to be false, and therefore its force and validity are incontrovertible.<br\/><br\/>There is an ancient principle of law recognized in cases of dispossession, detainer or usurpation that, before everything else, the person dispossessed or the owner of the property usurped or detained must be restored to his possession; and, following this principle, the owners of the realty in question applied to the justice of the peace in order to have the defendant deliver to them possession of the realty sold, which is no longer her property and which she is illegally and unjustly usurping.<br\/><br\/>The allegation that the contract executed between them was not a sale\u00a0 with right of repurchase but a mortgage, as well as the other contentions of the defendant and her sister the intervener, could be adduced by them in the Court of First Instance in exercising the proper action in the premises.\u00a0 But in spite of all these allegations the plaintiffs undoubtedly deserve the protection\u00a0 of the law and before everything else should be restored and placed in possession of the realty which they have purchased and of which they are now the absolute owners.\u00a0 After they have been placed in possession the vendor may present whatever claims she likes.<br\/><br\/>In the oral trial they instituted in the justice of the peace court they raised no question other than the recovery of the possession of said realty belonging to them; and if the defendants, now the plaintiffs, in order to avoid a decision favorable to the plaintiffs in that suit, now the defendants in these proceedings, and in order to have them dispossessed from the illegal detainer one of them enjoys, alleged that the latter is still\u00a0 the owner of the realty in litigation, for the reason that the contract entered into between them was a mortgage, such contentions and any other cannot prevent the justice of the peace from granting the petition of the plaintiffs based especially on their right of ownership acquired in virtue of a contract perfectly proven by a notarial instrument.<br\/><br\/>They could have raised questions over the ownership in the Court of First Instance, but the plaintiffs, who have been despoiled of the possession of the property of which they are the owners, ought first of all to be restored to possession of the realty belonging to them and unduly usurped by the defendant in the justice of the peace court.<br\/><br\/>If the owner of a thing legitimately acquired by virtue of a sale with right of repurchase, wherein the vendor has not exercised his right of repurchase, is to be denied the right to demand restitution of the possession detained by the latter merely through the presentation of some allegation relating to the property, it must be acknowledged that it will be easy for any vendor or tenant in bad faith to render ineffective the remedy established in section 80 of Act No. 190, the spirit whereof is undoubtedly imbued with the very ancient principle of law: <i>spoliatus ante omnia restitutus.<\/i><br\/><br\/>On the foregoing grounds it must be acknowledged that the justice of the peace of Pasay is clothed with full jurisdiction to hear and decide the claim made by Mariano Santero et al. for recovery of\u00a0 possession of the realty in question, and the decision of the Court of First Instance of Rizal has been rendered within its authority by virtue of its jurisdiction on appeal.<br\/><br\/>For the reasons set forth, issuance of the writ of eertiorari requested should be denied, with the costs against the appellant and the intervener in equal parts.<\/div>",

HEISER, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>JOHNSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">This is an appeal by the defendants from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, in which said court enjoined them from proceeding in the performance of their alleged duties, as prescribed in Ordinance No. 125 of the city of Manila.<br\/><br\/>The lower court held that said ordinance (No. 125) was null and void and for that reason enjoined the defendants from enforcing the same.<br\/><br\/>It appears from the record that the plaintiff, Edwin William Case, is the owner of a certain house and lot, located at No. 202 Calle Solana, within the walled city of Manila; that said house is occupied, from time to time, by a large number of persons. It seems to be an apartment house, gymnasium, or dormitory.<br\/><br\/>On or about the 20th of November, 1909, the assistant sanitary engineer of the Bureau of Health, by order of the Director of Health, addressed a letter to the representatives of the plaintiffs, informing them that the sanitary condition of said premises (202 Calle Solana) was very bad, and directing them to make connections with the new sewer system. (See Exhibit A.)<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff not having complied with the order contained in said notice (November 20, 1909), on the 28th of December, 1909, the said assistant engineer of the Bureau of Health addressed another letter (Exhibit B) to the representatives of the plaintiff, calling attention to the fact that the instructions in the former order not having been carried out he would be given ten days in which to comply with the same.<br\/><br\/>The foregoing notices of the orders and directions of the Director of Health were given to the plaintiff in compliance with the provisions of Ordinance No. 125 of the city of Manila, entitled:<br\/><blockquote>\"An ordinance to regulate and enforce the use of sewers and drains in the city of Manila, Philippine Islands.\"<\/blockquote>Thereafter, on the 12th of January, 1910, the plaintiff filed a petition in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, praying that the defendants be enjoined from carrying out the performance of said orders requiring the improvements in the sanitary conditions of said premises, and for a judgment of the court, declaring that the sanitary conditions of said property are good and in no manner injurious to the public health; and further, that the defendants were without lawful power or authority to order and compel the plaintiff to make on said premises the improvements ordered by said Director of Health.<br\/><br\/>To the said petition, the defendants presented the following demurrer:<br\/><blockquote>\"Now come the above-named defendants, through the Attorney-General, and demur to the complaint in the present case, on the following grounds:<br\/><br\/>\"1. That the court has no jurisdiction over one of the defendants in this action, for the reason that there does not exist any legal entity known as 'Junta de San idad de Manila.'\u00a0 (See section 21 of Act No. 183 and 5 (<i>e<\/i>) of Act No. 1407.)<br\/><br\/>\"2. That the court lacks jurisdiction over the subject matter of these proceedings, since an application for injunction cannot be sustained unless some material and irreparable damage is about to be done, and also because the legal remedy of injunction cannot be invoked to prevent a criminal prosecution under a city ordinance, even when that ordinance is null and void.<br\/><br\/>\"3. That there is omission and erroneous joinder of plaintiffs and defendants, for the firm of Ferrer &amp; Codina, agent of the plaintiff, who does not reside in the Philippines, has not been joined with its principal as plaintiffs, and, moreover, because there does not exist any legal entity named 'Junta de Sanidad de Manila,' and Victor G. Heiser is not director of said 'Junta.'<br\/><br\/>\"4. That the complaint does not set forth facts sufficient to constitute a right of action, because paragraph 3 of section 90 of Act No. 190 requires that when a complaint asks for a special remedy, like that of injunction, the basis whereon such remedy is asked should be stated therein, and the complaint in this case does not allege' the nullity of any ordinance, execution whereof the court is asked to prohibit.<br\/><br\/>\"5. That the complaint is vague, ambiguous and unintelligible, for it does not allege that no other remedy exists; that the complaint is contradictory in its terms, for paragraph VIII alleges that the Director of Health has no authority to issue the notice and order contained in Exhibit A, filed in this case, and paragraph IX that the court ought to prevent the defendants from compelling and obliging the plaintiff to make the changes and alterations mentioned in Exhibit A, prohibiting a criminal prosecution under municipal ordinances; and further because if the plaintiff is prosecuted for infraction of a municipal ordinance he cannot be caused irreparable damage, aside from the fact that the questions here raised can be raised in defense against said prosecution.<br\/><br\/>\"6. That the petition for relief is vague and ambiguous, because in paragraph (<i>a<\/i>) it asks for the issuance of a preliminary injunction to prohibit the defendants from executing the order marked Exhibit A, and in (<i>b<\/i>) it asks the court to declare that the sanitary conditions of the house mentioned therein are good and in no way prejudicial to the public health and that the defendants are not authorized to require the plaintiff to make the changes and alterations ordered in said Exhibit A; for the fact does not appear that Ordinance No, 125 of the city of Manila expressly authorizes the defendants to order the plaintiff to make in said building the alterations mentioned in Exhibit A.<br\/><br\/>\"Manila, P.

Heiser, are residents of said city of Manila;<br\/><br\/>\"(2) That said firm of Ferrer &amp; Codina, as the representative and agent in Manila of Edwin William Case, received on November 26, 1909, from the defendants a written order dated the 20th of said month, copy of which is attached to the complaint, marked Exhibit A and made a part, thereof, ordering the said Ferrer &amp; Codina to connect with the new sewer system all the sanitary apparatus, except those which receive rain water, of the premises at No. 202 Calle Solana, the property of the plaintiff, Edwin William Case;<br\/><br\/>\"(3) That on January 4, 1910, the said Ferrer &amp; Codina received another communication from the defendants dated December 28, 1909, copy of which is attached to the original complaint, marked Exhibit B, and made a part of this complaint, extending ten days the time for the execution of the order of November 20, 1909;<br\/><br\/>\"(4) That in the year 1902 the plaintiff, Edwin William Case, having received from the defendant 'Junta de Sanidad' a communication, copy of which is marked Exhibit C and attached to the complaint, ordering that he do and complete on the said premises at No. 202 Calle Solana the sanitary work set forth in said communication, executed all of said work and it was approved by said Board of Health and that said work cost the plaintiff P3,110.08;<br\/><br\/>\"(5) That for many years there has existed in the walled city, in which said premises No. 202 Calle Solanaare situated, a sewer system constructed for sanitary purposes by the municipality of Manila, which sewer system drains into the bay and has <i>thus far<\/i> been in good condition and in use, and that all the sanitary apparatus of said premises are at present connected with the said sewer system;<br\/><br\/>\"(6) That the premises in question are manifestly in as good sanitary condition now as immediately after the execution of the said work ordered by the defendant 'Junta de Sanidad' in its communication, Exhibit C, attached to the complaint in this case;<br\/><br\/>\"(7) That the performance of the work directed in the communication from the defendants of November 20, 1909, would cost at least P500 and would cause other additional expenses on account of the work that the city engineer of Manila would have to execute at the expense and risk of the plaintiffs;<br\/><br\/>\"(8) That the plaintiffs, upon the execution of said work, would have to pay thenceforth 50 per cent over the general rate for hydrant water in Manila on account of the consumption thereof on the property at No. 202 Calle Solana;<br\/><br\/>\"(9) That the defendant 'Junta de Sanidad' and its director are absolutely without lawful power and authority to order and compel the plaintiffs to perform the work mentioned in the communication, Exhibit A; and<br\/><br\/>\"(10) That the <i>Ordinance No, 125<\/i>, approved and published by the Municipal Board of Manila, and invoked by the defendants in their additional memorandum upon the demurrer to the complaint,<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> is<\/span> <i>null<\/i> and <i>void<\/i> in all and each of its parts and is in no manner obligatory, because the Municipal Board of Manila and said defendants are without lawful power and authority to enact, approve, and enforce said ordinance.\"<\/blockquote>The prayer of the amended complaint was to the effect that the court declare the plaintiff firm of Ferrer &amp; Codina entitled to the benefits of said order of January 25, 1910; that the court declare that the sanitary conditions of the premises No. 202 Calle Solana are very good, and in no manner and by no means injurious to the public health; and that the defendant 'Junta de Sanidad' and its director are absolutely without lawful power and authority to order and compel the plaintiffs to perform on said premises the work ordered by the defendants in their communication of November 20, 1909; that the court declare said Ordinance No. 125 to be <i>null and void and in no manner obligatory<\/i>; and finally, that the court condemn the defendants to the payment of the costs of the case and to grant the plaintiffs any other positive remedy to which they may be entitled in justice and equity.<br\/><br\/>To the foregoing complaint, on the 12th of July, 1910, the defendants presented their answer, alleging:<br\/><blockquote>\"1. They admit the allegations set forth in paragraphs Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 of said complaint.<br\/><br\/>\"2. Further answering said complaint, defendants (1) deny that the sewer connection required to be made in pursuance of the orders referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 of said complaint would cost the sum of P500 as therein alleged, and state to the court that the reasonable cost thereof would not exceed P100; (2) deny that defendants are not empowered to make the orders in question, and (3) deny that ordinance of the city of Manila, numbered 125, referred to in paragraph 10 of said amended complaint, is invalid owing either to lack of power of the Municipal Board of the city of Manila to enact and enforce said ordinance, or for any other reason.<br\/><br\/>\"3. Further answering said complaint, defendants allege and show to the court that the orders referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 of said amended complaint were issued in connection with many other similar orders and as a part of a general sanitary plan of the city of Manila to have the premises known as No. 202 Calle Solana, Intramuros, as well as all other premises in the walled city occupied and used by a considerable number of people, connected with the new sanitary sewers which have been recently constructed and completed by the municipality at great expense for the purpose of improving the sanitary conditions within said city. In this connection defendants respectfully state and show to the court that the old sewers, with which said premises are now connected, run on flat and faulty grades, the sewage passing directly through the old moat and other surface channels into the Pasig River; thereby polluting all of said surface watercourses; that the contents of the new or sanitary sewers are pumped from the pumping station on the Tondo beach for a distance of over a mile over the flats into the deep water of Manila Bay; and that according to the present plans adopted by the city of Manila the old sewers are in the future to be reserved for storm or rain water only, in order that the small channels left in the old moat and other watercourses into which said sewers empty may be kept comparatively free from pollution.<br\/><br\/>\"Defendants further represent to the court that it is particularly urgent that said premises No. 202 Calle Solana, Intramuros, be connected with the new sewers, as directed to be done by said orders, for the reason that although almost every house in the walled city of Marilla is equipped with an aseptic tank or modern cesspool which purifies the sewage to a certain extent, said premises No. 202 Calle Solana, Intramuros, have no vault or cesspool, but that the crude sewage (human feces, etc.) from said house enters the old sewer direct, passing thence into the city moat and gradually finding its way by means of a small, sluggish watercourse to the Pasig River, catch basins Nos. 1 and 2 of the order dated January 3, 1902, referred to in paragraph 4 of said amended complaint, being merely small sediment basins which do not interrupt the free flow of crude sewage as above explained.<br\/><br\/>\"<i>Wherefore<\/i>, defendants pray that the restraining order granted in this case by this court on the 25th day of January, 1910, be set aside, and that plaintiff's complaint and amended complaint be dismissed at the cost of plaintiffs; and they further pray for such other relief as equity and justice may require.'<\/blockquote>Upon the issues thus formed by the amended complaint and answer, the cause was set down for trial.<br\/><br\/>After a consideration of all of the facts submitted, the Honorable Simplicio del Rosario, judge, in a very interesting opinion, in which he discussed the facts and the law relating to the questions presented, reached the conclusion that said Ordinance No. 125 was null and without force, and made the preliminary injunction issued on the 25th of January, 1910, permanent, perpetually prohibiting the defendants from carrying into effect said orders of November 20, 1909.<br\/><br\/>From that conclusion of the lower court the defendants appealed, after having made a motion for a new trial in the lower court.<br\/><br\/>The appellants allege that the lower court committed the following errors:<br\/><blockquote>\"1. The Court of First Instance erred in declaring that Ordinance No. 125 of the city of Manila is null and void, on the ground that it is unreasonable, unjust, oppressive and opposed to the civil laws and the provisions of the Philippine Bill.<br\/><br\/>\"2. The Court of First Instance erred in declaring that the health authorities are without legal authority or power to require plaintiff to connect his premises with the new Fewer system, except at the expense of the city of Manila, or upon the payment of damages in the amount of the cost to plaintiff of the connection made with the old sewer system in the year 1902.<br\/><br\/>\"3. The Court of First Instance erred in declaring that the plaintiff, Edwin William Case, cannot be disturbed in his use of the connection made by him at No. 202 Calle Solana with the old sewer system in the year 1902 or be deprived thereof, wholly or partially, by the defendants, without the payment of the corresponding damages.<br\/><br\/>\"4. The Court of First Instance erred in granting a permanent injunction against the defendants, thus preventing them from proceeding in the performance of their duties under the provisions of said Ordinance No. 125 of the city of Manila for the protection of the health of the inhabitants of said city.<br\/><br\/>\"5. The Court of First Instance erred in overruling defendant's motion for a new trial.\"<\/blockquote>Before discussing the questions presented by the assignments of error, we deem it advisable to present the questions of fact which the record discloses. The present case presents questions both of fact and of law. The plaintiffs maintain:<br\/><br\/><i>(a)<\/i> That the premises in question are in a sanitary condition; and <i>(b)<\/i> That the city of Manila had no right or authority to adopt and enforce said Ordinance No. 125.<br\/><br\/>The defendants allege that the premises are in an insanitary condition and maintain that the city of Manila had authority to adopt and enforce said ordinance.<br\/><br\/>From the record it appears that there were two hearings during the pendency of the cause in the lower court, at which proof was adduced.\u00a0 The first was when the question as to the right of the plaintiffs to a preliminary injunction was under consideration, and the second when the merits of the, cause were investigated. In neither of these hearings did the plaintiffs present any proof whatever in support of the facts alleged in the complaint. At the first hearing the defendants presented two witnesses, Dr. Victor G. Heiser, Director of Health of the Philippine Islands, and W. C. Palmer, assistant sanitary engineer of the city of Manila. At the second hearing the defendants presented Mr. George H. Guerdrum, sanitary engineer of the Bureau of Health.<br\/><br\/>As was said above, the plaintiffs presented no proof whatever in support of the allegations contained in the complaint. Whatever facts were presented by the defendants therefore stand undisputed in the record.\u00a0 By mutual agreement Ordinance No. 125 was admitted in evidence without objection. Dr. Victor G. Heiser testified with reference to the sanitary condition of the premises in question as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Q. Are you familiar with the property or lot at No. 202 in Calle Solana, Intramuros?\u2014A.\u00a0 In a general way, yes.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.

Board of Health new sewer system of the city.\u2014A.\u00a0 The new sewer system is modern in every way. It is a covered system, offering no menace to the public health; I mean that it is underground ; and one of the principal reasons assigned for this new system is to eliminate the old system.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Please state the cost of this new sewer system and the time needed to put it into operation.\u2014A.\u00a0 It took several years to construct, and cost several million pesos.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Please explain to the court the sewer plan prepared by the health authorities, and in particular the plan of the sewer system in Intramuros. What is desired is the reason for constructing this sewer system.\u2014A.\u00a0 In view of the fact that the walled city is especially congested, and the greater part of the people live in dwelling houses, which are not apartments or hotels and lodging houses, it is difficult to handle the question of hygiene and it is desired that this part of the city be connected immediately with the new sewer system.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. State whether at the present time a general effort has been made for the purpose of connecting the house with the new sewer system.\u2014A.\u00a0 Yes, sir.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Please tell the court whether in your opinion as a health officer this house in question in this case ought to be connected with the new sewer system.-A.\u00a0 Not only necessary, but also it is imperative, especially In this house mentioned in this case, that it be connected immediately with the new system, on account of the crowd of people that live in said house.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. State whether the old sewer system has been declared by competent authority to be dangerous to the public health.\u2014A, I have informed the division of engineering and the Department of Sanitation that the old system is a menace to the public health.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Do you know how many live in the house No. 202 Calle Solana?\u2014A. I don't know the exact number, but I do know that many people live there. <br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 And is that the only reason for issuing the order to the owner of that house to connect its sanitary installations with the new system?\u2014A.\u00a0 The order was issued because the house is in an insanitary condition.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. As soon as the houses in Manila are connected with the new sewer system, what disposition will be made of the old?-A.\u00a0 The old one will be abolished.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Will it be absolutely abandoned or will it be destroyed?\u2014A. That is the intention.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. What is the present nature of that sewer system, is it a permanent structure, or merely temporary?\u2014A.\u00a0 With reference to the sewer system outside the walls, it is a temporary structure.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Of what materials?\u2014A.\u00a0 The greater part of wood,<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Is it covered in any way?\u2014A.\u00a0 The greater part is not covered.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. You mean that it is an open ditch around the walls, conveying the feces from Intramuros?\u2014A.\u00a0 Yes, sir.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. How long, Doctor, have those conditions existed in that sewer system?\u2014A.\u00a0 Outside the walls, in the outer part, for several years.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. And the old sewer system that exists in the city of Manila, how long has it existed, the old one?\u2014A.\u00a0 I don't know exactly, but it has certainly existed for many years.\" George H. Guerdrum, being first duly sworn, testified as follows ;<br\/><br\/>\"Q. State your name, occupation, and residence.\u2014A.\u00a0 George H.

Are you familiar with the building at No. 202 Calle Solana, Intramuros?\u2014A.\u00a0 Yes, sir.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Can you state to the court the conditions in which this building is, with reference to its connection with the new sewer system, and also with reference to its sanitary installations?\u2014A. The question, your honor,M that the exterior installations connected with the sewer are defective, and are not good conductors of the feces that come from that building.\u00a0 More or less sanitary installations have been placed inside the house; these sanitary installations are now in a rather defective condition.\u00a0 The question we wish to demonstrate is not exactly with reference to these few defects that exist in the sanitary installation in this house, but the way in which feces that issue from the building ought to be disposed of, which is the duty of the sanitary department.\u00a0 The records of our office show that the sanitary installations inside this house were renewed in the year 1902; at that time, nevertheless, the feces that came from this house were carried away by the old Spanish sewer, by the storm drain.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. <i>How might that have been avoided<\/i>?\u2014A,\u00a0 That might have been avoided by properly constructing an aseptic vault. These aseptic vaults are constructed in such way that the feces which pass through that vault are filtered, letting the liquid part flow away.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. To what degree, or to what extent is this aseptic vault to which you refer in use here in the walled city?\u2014A.\u00a0 I would like to state that during the three years I have been working in this line, I have examined all the houses in Manila, and only with the exception of some houses beside the Pasig, <i>almost 95 per cent have been connected with these aseptic vaults<\/i>, long before the termination of the new sewer system.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Describe to the court with more details the exact purpose of constructing these vaults.\u00a0 (Counsel for the plaintiffs excepted to this question, saying: \" <i>I admit that the house has no aseptic vaults, because it is connected with the old sewer system.\")<\/i>\u2014A.\u00a0 The purpose of an aseptic vault is to hold the solid material that comes from these feces issuing from the house, and in a general way to purify it in such manner that the liquid part which afterwards flows through the installations be free from germs.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. And without this vault, where do the feces from this building pass out?\u2014A.\u00a0 Without these aseptic vaults, the feces pass out in that crude form through the Spanish sewer in Calle Solana, and afterwards pass along Oalle Real and flow into that open ditch in the Parian Gate.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. What kind of building is this at No. 202 Calle Solana?\u2014A.\u00a0 It is a very large building, of stone and wood, has a frontage, that is, a frontage on Calle Solana, of 15 or 20 meters, and on the Calle San Francisco side, probably about 20.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. To what use is this house put?\u2014A.\u00a0 It was used for several years as a students' dormitory, and before that it was a big hotel known as the 'Hotel de Francia and is now used as a gymnasium.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. What would have been done with regard to the feces which issue from that building, if the ordinance had been enforced?\u2014A. If this order had been enforced the feces that issue from this building would have passed through the new sewer system.\u00a0 This new sewer system was constructed by the city at a cost of several million pesos and after a careful investigation which demonstrated that the old Spanish sewer system was defective and unsubstantial.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Wherein is it defective?\u2014A.\u00a0 One of the defects of this old system is the grade of the sewer, which is so low that the solid matter of the feces remains in the bottom of the sewer and upon its sides; and the feces that also pass through this old sewer flow directly through these open ditches and also into the Pasig River, which is subject to ebb and flow, this matter is deposited in the estuaries and open ditches of the city, in this way contaminating with germs the greater part of the localities of the city.\u00a0 In the new sewer system this defect in the grade of the sewer has been corrected by establishing stations where the material is pumped to give more flow to the feces, whereby they flow rapidly from a higher to a lower level, and thence, by means of a pump, this material is raised up, these feces, and then again from a lower to a higher level, and so on successively.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. In this new system, what is finally done, what procedure is used with these feces?\u2014A.\u00a0 The crude material is finally ejected by means of a pumping station on the Tondo beach.\u00a0 This is the final pumping station; and from this last pumping station the feces are ejected through pipes laid under the water, more than a mile out to sea, where the current takes them up and carries them away, whence they may not return to the city.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Has the waterworks system of the city any connection with this sewer system, and if so, what connection?\u2014A.\u00a0 This new waterworks system was constructed in the first place for the purpose of furnishing water; and this new waterworks system brings water to many private houses, and that water is used in the sanitary installations, water closets, and ditches,<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Do there exist in any of the houses that are not connected with this new sewer system facilities for getting this help from the new water system, for the purpose of being able to get rid of the human feces and other filth?\u2014A.\u00a0 Before the construction of this system the old way was to let the water carry these feces to the place where the aseptic vaults are, and from these aseptic vaults, although at greater expense, they used sometimes to take out these feces and put them on board the steamer <i>Pluto<\/i> and carry them outside the bay, where the material was dumped.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. You are now referring to the properties that are connected with the aseptic vaults?\u2014A.\u00a0 Yes, sir.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Then, of what use would be this new sewer system if no orders existed for buildings to connect their sanitary installations with the new system, or if they should not make connection?\u2014A.\u00a0 Then it would be of no use.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Explain to the court.\u2014A.\u00a0 I will explain to your honor the reason for what I have just said, and that is, because the rain water is not allowed, to pass through the new sewer system.\u00a0 The new sewer system is only for the feces gathered from all parts of the city of Manila.\u00a0 I would like to explain to your honor that this crude material not only comes from the feces but for the greater part consists principally of water from this Carriedo system, which mixes the human feces with the filth or material that is taken from the stables, fish entrails, and other things. All this water, after being used by the houses, is mixed with these feces and other matter, which forms what we call the crude material that passes through this new sewer system.\u00a0 <br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"Q. You have said that the old sewer system empties into open ditches toward the outside of the Parian Gate?\u2014A. Yes, sir.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. How long have these ditches been open?\u2014A.\u00a0 For several hundred years, several centuries.\u00a0 Since the construction of the walls, of those moats.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Those ditches have never been covered?-A.\u00a0 So far as I know those ditches have never been covered. I only know that recently the Government has filled up a part of these ditches, reducing them merely to a small ditch which is for the flow there of the human feces.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Does the old sewer of Intramuros, inside the walled city, empty into any estuary?\u2014A.\u00a0 There are several points of discharge; some of them empty through that open ditch, others through the Pasig River.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. But none of the final mouths of that sewer empty into any estuary?\u2014A.\u00a0 These open ditches lead, though in an indirect way, to the estuary, because they empty into the Pasig River and the river flows into those estuaries.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Do you know how many houses of the walled city are connected with the old sewer?\u2014A.\u00a0 At present and during the last few months, about a hundred houses have removed their connections with the old system.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. But isn't it true that the greater part, if not all, the houses in Intramuros were and are connected with the old sewer system, with the exception of those hundred houses to which you refer?\u2014A.\u00a0 Ninety-nine per cent of the houses here in Intramuros do not discharge the crude material into the old system for this reason, because the greater part of these houses still have the privy, as it was called in the time of the Spanish government, and those that have no privies have an aseptic vault.\u00a0 And this house at No. 202 Calle Solana is one of the few that have direct connection with the old system, <i>without having a privy or an aseptic vault.<\/i><br\/><br\/>\"Q. Have those orders issued by the 'Junta de Sanidad' for connection of the house with the new sewer system been issued to the houses with a privy or an aseptic vault?\u2014A.\u00a0 I would like to explain to your honor that we have issued orders and have tried to carry out these orders in the houses that have had aseptic vaults since 1903, 1904, up to 1906, and this was done for two reasons: one of which is <i>that the construction of these aseptic vaults is merely for temporary or provisional use, pending the construction of this new sewer system<\/i>; and another reason is that when the aseptic vault is defective, is out of order, we give orders for connection with the new system; and another reason is, when we have an order to compel the houses to connect with the new system of a district, for example, we compel all the houses in a block to connect their installations with the new system, we aren't going to make an exception of one house in each block, so that it should not make connection, all the houses have to make connection. For example, four months ago we issued orders to all the houses in the Escolta, and in that case, all were notified to comply with that order.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Do you mean to tell the court that inside Intramuros this old system is entirely open?\u2014A.\u00a0 In Intramuros there are many openings in this old system, for example, at the street corners there is generally and ordinarily that iron grating for reception of rain water.\u00a0 In this way it may be said that that crude material is exposed to the air on the street corners.\"<\/blockquote>The foregoing proof shows, beyond question, that the method of depositing the sewage from said premises No. 202 Calle Solana, Intramuros, is insanitary and likely to produce disease and discomfort, not only to the occupants of said house, but to the people of the city of Manila. It would be possible, under the system used, for instance, if a typhoid germ should be deposited in the water-closet system of said premises, for the same to reach the Pasig River, and thence be carried to every one of the numerous <i>esteros<\/i> of the city and thus be communicated to the thousands of inhabitants who use water from the rivers and <i>esteros<\/i> for bathing and other purposes. The detrimental effect from such possibilities to the health and comfort of the people of the city can scarcely be overestimated.<br\/><br\/>From the proof clearly showing that said premises are insanitary, we pass to a consideration of the question whether or not the city of Manila, through the sanitary authorities, had the power to remedy such conditions, in the manner attempted by the defendant in the present case.<br\/><br\/>The city of Manila is clearly authorized by its charter to enact ordinances.\u00a0 It is thus authorized to legislate upon certain questions which are defined in said charter.\u00a0 These questions are more or less definitely and expressly defined by said charter. The charters of municipalities generally contain powers which are known and included within \"the general welfare powers of municipal corporations.\" We find such a general welfare clause in the charter of the city of Manila (Act No. 183).\u00a0 Section 16 of said charter, among other things, provides that the Board \"shall make such ordinances and regulations as may be necessary to carry into effect and discharge the powers and duties conferred by this Act, and to provide for the peace, order, safety, and general welfare of the city and its inhabitants.\u00a0 In addition to the foregoing general powers of the Board, we find enumerated in section 17. of said charter a number of specific powers conferred upon said Board. In paragraph (<i>t<\/i>) we find that the Board is authorized \"to lay out, construct, improve and regulate the use of streets, avenues, alleys, sidewalks, wharves, piers, parks, cemeteries, and other public places; to prevent and remove encroachments from the same; to provide for the lighting, cleaning and sprinkling of streets and public places, * * *\u00a0 To prohibit the throwing or depositing of offal, garbage, refuse or other,offensive matter in the same and to provide for its collection and disposition; to regulate openings therein for the laying of gas, water, sewer and other pipes therein, the building and repair of tunnels, sewers, and drains, and all structures therein and thereunder, and the erecting of poles and the stringing of wires therein, etc.\"<br\/><br\/>In paragraph (<i>x<\/i>) of said section (17) we find that the Board is authorized \"to establish and maintain public drains, sewers, latrines, and cesspools.\"<br\/><br\/>In paragraph (<i>dd<\/i>) of said section (17) we find that the Board is authorized <i>\"to enforce the regulations of the Bureau of Health for the Philippine Islands<\/i> and by ordinance to prescribe fines and penalties for violations of said regulations.\"<br\/><br\/>Under paragraph (<i>jj<\/i>) of said section (17) the Board is authorized \"to declare, prevent, and abate nuisances;\" while in paragraph (<i>kk<\/i>) of the same section the Board is authorized <i>\"to make, publish, amend and repeal all ordinances, necessary to carry into effect the powers herein granted, and to enforce the same by fines and penalties, within the limits authorized by law\"<\/i><br\/><br\/>Section 33 of the charter of Manila provides that the city engineer \"shall have the care and custody of the public system of water works and sewers, and all sources of water supply and shall control, maintain, and regulate the use of the same in accordance with the <i>ordinances<\/i> relating thereto, shall inspect and regulate, subject to the approval of the Board, the use of all private systems for supplying water to the city and its inhabitants, and <i>all private sewers and their connection with the public sewer system.\" <\/i> In, addition to the foregoing general and special powers conferred upon the Municipal Board and the officers of the city of Manila, Act No. 1150 of the Philippine Commission further defines the powers and duties of the Board of Health for the Philippine Islands and of the Municipal Board of the city of Manila, in connection with the preservation of the public health of said city. Section 1 of said Act (No. 1150) provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"Subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, the Board of Health for the Philippine Islands, acting in its capacity as a local board of health fpr the city of Manila, shall draft and forward, through the Secretary of the Interior, to the Municipal Board for enactment, health ordinances for that city.

Said ordinance provides that:<br\/><blockquote>\"When any premises shall have been so inspected and defects found in the material or plumbing, written notice of such defects shall be served upon the owner or agent of the premises, who shall make the repairs or changes directed within the time specified therein. Failure to comply with the order shall be a violation of this Ordinance\" (No. 86).<\/blockquote>Said Ordinance (No. 86) in article 18 (Revised Ordinances, section 183) provides for a system of permissible receptacles until the new sewer system, which was at the date of said ordinance under construction shall be completed. Said section 18 (183) provides that until the new sewer system now under construction is in operation the different systems of receptacles for the collection and removal of filth in sanitary installations, to be permitted after the 1st of January, 1907, shall be as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"First.

Under the amendment different systems of receptacles for the collection of filth and sewage of the city and the removal thereof were permitted, subject to the approval of the Director of Health, on and after the 1st of August, 1909. By said amendment (Ordinance No. 120), direct discharge into the new sewer system became obligatory in the case of all <i>premises abutting<\/i> upon a street through which the new sewer system had been laid. It will be noted, therefore, that connection with the new sewer system, under said Ordinance No. 120, did not apply to all premises. By Ordinance No. 125, however, it will be noted that Ordinance No. 120 was amended, requiring <i>every building<\/i> or premises in the city of Manila to be connected with the sanitary sewer system, when the owner or agent of such building or premises shall be 30 required in writing, by the official designated by the Municipal Board or by the Director of Health, or his authorized representative, provided that the sewer into which such building or premises may be drained is ready for service.<br\/><br\/>In the present case it is admitted that the new sewer system into which the sewage from the house in question (202 Calle Solana) may be drained was completed prior to the said notice of November 20, 1909, on which date the plaintiff herein was required to connect the drainage system of his house with the new sanitary sewer system.<br\/><br\/>From the foregoing provisions of the charter of Manila (Act No. 183) and the amendment thereto (Act No. 1150) it seems clear that the Municipal Board had been expressly authorized to adopt the ordinance in question, and that the defendants herein were duly authorized to require the plaintiffs to do the things demanded of them to be done in said notice of November 20, 1909, and that by virtue of Ordinance No. 125, the plaintiffs are liable to be punished in the manner prescribed therein for a failure to comply\u00a0 with the terms of said notice.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiffs contend that said ordinance is unreasonable, illegal, and void.\u00a0 As we observed above, said ordinance was adopted in pursuance of express power conferred upon the city of Manila by the legislative department of the Government.\u00a0 The plaintiffs have not called our attention to any fundamental law which is contravened by said charter or ordinance. The defendants contend that said charter and ordinance are clearly within the police powers of the State, and that there is no fundamental law of the State restraining the power of the city, under the \"general welfare clause\" of the charter, from adopting: such ordinances as may be deemed necessary to regulate and abate nuisances, and thus to protect the health, peace, and comfort of the inhabitants. The said ordinance being within the express powers conferred by the legislative department of the Government, the courts will not pronounce the same unreasonable, illegal, and void, unless and until it is shown to have contravened or violated some fundamental law.\u00a0 Courts are slow to pronounce statutes invalid or void.\u00a0 The question of the validity of every statute is first determined by the legislative department of the Government itself, and the courts should resolve every presumption in favor of its validity. Courts are not justified in adjudging statutes invalid, in the face of the conclusion of the legislature, when the question of its validity is at all doubtful.\u00a0 The courts must assume that the validity of the statute was fully considered by the legislature when adopted.\u00a0 Courts will not presume a statute invalid unless it clearly appears that it falls within some of the inhibitions of the fundamental laws of the State.\u00a0 The wisdom or advisability of a particular statute is not a question for the courts to determine\u2014that is a question for the legislature to determine.\u00a0 The courts may or may not agree with the legislature upon the wisdom or necessity of the law.\u00a0 Their disagreement, however, furnishes no basis for pronouncing a statute illegal. If the particular statute is within the constitutional power of the legislature to enact, whether the courts agree or not in the wisdom of its enactment is a matter of no concern.\u00a0 Upon the other hand, however, if the statute covers subjects not authorized by the fundamental laws of the land or its constitution, then the courts are not only authorized but are justified in pronouncing the same illegal and void, no matter how wise or beneficient such legislation may seem to be.\u00a0 <br\/><br\/>Courts are not justified in measuring the opinions of the legislative department of the Government, as expressed in statutes, upon questions of the wisdom, justice, and advisability of a particular law.<br\/><br\/>In exercising the high authority conferred upon the courts to pronounce valid or invalid a only the administrators of the public the fundamental law of the land.\u00a0 If an act of the legislature is to be held illegal, it is not because the judges have any control over the legislative power, but because the act is forbidden by the fundamental law of the land and because the will of the people, as declared by such fundamental law is paramount and must be obeyed, even by the legislature. In pronouncing a statute illegal, the courts are simply interpreting the meaning, force, and application of the fundamental law of the State. (U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Ten Yu, <i>supra<\/i>, p. 1; State Board of Health <i>vs<\/i>. City of Greenville, 98 N. E. Reporter, 1019.)<br\/><br\/>It is also argued by the plaintiffs that said ordinance is unreasonable, in that it requires another expenditure so soon after the expenditure of a large sum of money, namely P3, 110.08, in the year 1902, for the purpose of complying with an order of the defendants at that time.\u00a0 The plaintiffs allege that to comply with the order of November 20, 1909, would require an expenditure of the additional sum of P500. This fact is denied by the defendants.\u00a0 The defendants allege that the order of November 20, 1909, might be complied with by an outlay of a sum not to exceed P100.\u00a0 Upon this question, however, neither party offered any proof.\u00a0 It is within the possibilities to have orders, of the character of that with which we are dealing, to follow each other, in point of time, so rapidly that the courts would be justified in intervening, by the extraordinary equitable remedy of injunction, to prevent the doing of a positive injustice, under a perfectly legal and valid law. While the courts hesitate to intervene in the method of enforcing the law by the executive department of the Government, they have a right to insist that even a valid law shall not be enforced in a\u00a0 manner that will amount to practically a confiscation of private property.\u00a0 In the present case, however, viewing all the facts and circumstances, there seems to be no reason for sustaining the contention of the plaintiffs, that the enforcement of the ordinance is being done in an unreasonable manner.\u00a0 The enforcement of the ordinance, under the evidence presented in the present case, is a reasonable application of the same, when we take into consideration the insanitary conditions produced as a result of the failure of the plaintiffs to comply with the order of the defendants.\u00a0 The only changes apparently necessary to make at the present time, in order to comply with the order of the defendants, is simply to connect the old system installed in the house with the new sewer system, at practically a nominal cost. The sanitary fixtures in the house itself apparently need no, change or alteration, in order to comply with the order of the defendants.<br\/><br\/>In the case of The Health Department <i>vs<\/i>. Trinity Church (145 N. Y., 32, 49; 27 L. R. A., 710, 716; 45 American State Reports, 579, 590), Judge Peckham, who was later an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, in discussing, the necessity of a strict compliance with orders looking to the sanitation of insanitary premises, said:<br\/><blockquote>\"Dirt, filth, and nastiness in general are great promoters of disease-that they breed pestilence, contagion, sickness, and death, cannot be successfully denied.\u00a0 There is scarcely a dissent from the general belief on the part of all who have studied the disease that cholera is essentially a filth disease.\u00a0 The so-called ship fever or jail fever arises from filth. Most diseases are aggravated by it.\"<\/blockquote>Every citizen of every community, in civilized society, must bear certain burdens imposed for the good of all.\u00a0 The plantiffs complain that the expense imposed upon them, by virtue of said order of the defendants, is unreasonable.\u00a0 It has been shown, however, by the proof adduced during the trial of the cause, that the filth and human excrement deposited in the old sewer from said house might reach every one of the numerous <i>esteros<\/i> in the city of Manila and thus jeopardize the health of the people of the entire city.\u00a0 A simple illustration may show the unreasonableness of the contention of the plaintiffs.\u00a0 Under the law men are not permitted to appear on the streets in public in a nude condition. Might the plaintiffs justify a violation of that law upon the ground that they had purchased expensive suits of clothing eight or ten years before and that it was unreasonable to require them to buy other suits now, even though the first had lost their capacity to hide their nakedness?\u00a0 Could they justify a violation of the law upon that ground\u2014upon the ground solely that it was too expensive?\u00a0 That law is made to protect public morals and public decency.\u00a0 The ordinance is to protect public health.\u00a0 There seems to be little difference in principle between the above example and the present case, so far as the reasonableness of the contention of the plaintiffs is concerned.<br\/><br\/>The particular ordinance now under consideration was clearly designed to preserve and protect the health, comfort, and convenience of the inhabitants of the thickly populated city of Manila, and therefore, in its scope, falls directly under what is generally known as the police power of the Government.\u00a0 This power of the State has but few limitations when it is exercised to secure the <i>peace, safety health, morals,<\/i> and the <i>best<\/i> and <i>highest interests of the public.<\/i><br\/><br\/>Judge Cooley, one of the best and clearest law writers and jurists, in discussing this power, said:<br\/><blockquote>\"No definition of the power can be more complete and satisfactory than some which have been given by eminent jurists in deciding cases which have arisen from its exercise, and which have been so often approved and adopted that to present them in any other than the language of the decisions would be unwise, if not inexcusable. Says Chief Justice Shaw:\u00a0 'We think it is a settled principle, growing out of the nature of well-ordered civil society, that every holder of property, however absolute and unqualified may be his title, holds it under the implied liability that his use of it shall not be injurious to the equal enjoyment of others having an equal right to the enjoyment of their property, nor injurious to the right s of the community.\u00a0 All property in this Commonwealth is * * * held subject to those general regulations which are necessary\u00a0 the common good and general welfare.\u00a0 Right of property like all other social and convention rights, are subject to such reasonable limitations in their enjoyment as shall prevent them from being injurious and to such reasonable restraints and regulations established by law as the legislature, under the governing and controlling power vested in them by the constitution, may think necessary and expedient.\u00a0 This is very different from the right of the eminent domain\u2014the right of government to take and appropriate property when ever the public exigency requires it, which can be done only in condition of providing a reasonable compensation therefor.\u00a0 The power we allude to is to rather the police power; the power vested in the legislature by the constitution to make, ordain and establish all manner of wholesome and reasonable laws, statutes, and ordinances either with penalties or without, not repugnant to the constitution, as they shall judge to be for the good and welfare of the Commonwealth, and of the subjects of the same.\u00a0 It is much easier to perceive and realize the existence and sources of this power than to mark its boundaries, or prescribe limits to its exercise.<br\/><br\/>\" This police power of the State', says another eminent judge, 'extends to the protection of the lives, limbs, health, comfort, and quiet of all persons, and the protection of all property within the State.\u00a0 According to the maxim, <i>Sicutere tuo ut alienum non laedas<\/i>, which being of universal application, it must, of course, be within the range of legislative action to define the mode and manner in which every one may so use his own as not to injure others.'\u00a0 And again: (By this) 'general police power of the State, persons and property are subjected to all kinds of restrains and burdens, in order to secure the general comfort, health, and prosperity of the State; of the perfect right in the legislature\u00a0 to do which, no question ever was, or upon acknowledged general principles, ever can be made, so far as natural persons are concerned.' And neither the power itself, nor the discretion to exercise it as need may require, can be bargained away by the State.\" (Cooley's Constitutional Limitations, Chapter XVI, pages 705, 706; Commonwealth vs. Alger (7 Cush. (Mass.), 53, 84); Thorpe vs. R. R. Co. (27 Vt., 140, 149).)<\/blockquote>In discussing the same question, the late Mr. Justice Field, of the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of Crowley <i>vs<\/i>. Christensen (137 U. S., 86, 89) said:<br\/><blockquote>\"Even liberty itself, the greatest of all rights, is not unrestricted license to act according to one's own will.\u00a0 It is only freedom from restraint under conditions essential to the equal enjoyment of the same right by others.\"<\/blockquote>In the case of Holden <i>vs<\/i>. Hardy (169 U. S., 366, 395) Mr. Justice Brown said:<br\/><blockquote>\"It is as much for the interest of the State that the public health should be preserved as that life should be made secure. With this end in view quarantine laws have been enacted in most if not all of the States; insane asylums, public hospitals, and institutions for the care and education of the blind established; and special measures taken for the exclusion of infected cattle, rags, and decayed fruit.\u00a0 In other States laws have been enacted limiting the hours during which women and children shall be employed in factories; and while their constitutionality, at least as applied to women, has been doubted in some of the States, they have been generally upheld.\"<\/blockquote>It is now generally recognized by all civilized States that J the legislative department of the Government, under the ' police powers of the State, is possessed with plenary power to deal with all matters relating to the public, health, morals, and safety of the people, so long as it does not contravene any positive inhibition of the organic law, and providing that such power is not exercised in such a manner as to justify the interference of the courts to prevent positive wrong and oppression.<br\/><br\/>In discussing this power of the State, the late Mr. Justice Harlan of the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of Jacobson <i>vs<\/i>. Massachusetts (197 U. S., 11, 31; 3 A. &amp; E. Ann. Cas., 765), said:<br\/><blockquote>\"If there is any such power in the judiciary to review legislative action in respect of a matter affecting the general welfare, it can only be when that which the legislature has done comes within the rule that if a statute purporting to have been enacted to protect the public health, the public morals, or the public safety has no real or substantial relation to those objects, or is, beyond all question, a plain palpable invasion of rights secured by the fundamental law, it is the duty of the courts to so adjudge, and thereby give effect to the Constitution.\"<\/blockquote>This doctrine has also been declared in the following cases: Mugler <i>vs<\/i>. Kansas (123 U. S., 623, 661; 8 Sup. Ct., 273; 31 L. Ed., 205); Minnesota <i>vs<\/i>. Barber (136 U. S., 313, 320; 10 Sup. Ct, 862; 24 L; Ed., 455)\"; Atkin <i>vs<\/i>. Kansas (191 U. S., 207, 223; 24 Sup.Ct., 124; 48 L. Ed., 148).<br\/><br\/>The present is not the first time the. courts have been called upon to answer the question whether or not a statute or ordinance is reasonable and legal which requires owners of private property to incur expense in order to remedy an insanitary condition, and thereby preserve the health and convenience of the people.\u00a0 This question has been answered by various eminent jurists and by courts of the highest standing, practically unanimously in the affirmative.<br\/><br\/>In the case of the Tenement House Department of the City of New York <i>vs<\/i>. Moeschen (179 N. Y., 325; 70 L. R. A., 704; 103 American State Reports, 910; 203 U. S., 583), the defendant was required by law to change the water closets theretofore used in her premises for another system. In that case, as in the present, the system which had been installed in the house of the defendant had been installed pursuant to an order of the board of health of the city of New York and the mandate of the legislature of the State.\u00a0 The defendant argued that to require her to incur the expense of installing another and new system was, in effect, depriving her of her property without due process of law; that to require the additional expense, in view of the former expense incurred by virtue of an order of the plaintiff, rendered the statute or ordinance unreasonable and therefore unenforceable.\u00a0 The question of the legality of the statute having been sustained in the lower court, it finally reached the supreme court of the State of New York, where the court, speaking through Mr. Justice Bartlett, said, in part (pp. 330, 331) :<br\/><blockquote>\"It is not the hardship of the individual case that determines the question, but rather the general scope and effect of the legislation as an exercise of the police power, in protecting the health and promoting the welfare of the community at large.<br\/><br\/>\"The single question is presented in this case whether the legislation under consideration is a lawful exercise of the police power, imposing upon the citizen only such expenses as are reasonable.\u00a0 We are of the opinion that, considering the facts in the case, the language of the section under review, and the expense incurred in making the necessary changes required, that the legislation is a proper exercise of the police power.\"<\/blockquote>In the case of the Health Department <i>vs<\/i>.\u00a0 Trinity Church <i>(supra)<\/i>, Mr. Justice Peckham, in discussing the question of the effect of the additional expense in complying with an order such as was made in the present case, said (p. 43):<br\/><blockquote>\"Instances are numerous of the passage of laws which entail expense on the part of those who must comply with them and where such expenses must be borne by them without any hearing or compensation because of the provisions of the law.\" (Thorpe <i>vs<\/i>. R. R. Co., 27 Vt., 140-152; 62 American Decisions, 625.)<\/blockquote>Many more analogous cases might be cited in support of the doctrine that if the premises are insanitary, the mere fact that the owner of the property is required to incur expense in rendering the same sanitary, can in no sense render an ordinance like the one under discussion unreasonable.\u00a0 (State Board of Health <i>vs<\/i>.

Santamaria, judge, set aside the sale of a house and of the land described in the complaint made by the defendant Cipriano Dandoy to his codefendant, Fruto Alarba, with respect to two-thirds of the property, of which the said Dandoy was not the owner, and declared that the said land belonged <i>pro indiviso<\/i> to Cipriano Dandoy and his nephews, Juan and Dominga Dandoy, represented by the plaintiffs, with right to apply for the partition thereof; with the costs of the suit against the defendants, Dandoy and Alarba.<br\/><br\/>On October 14, 1909, the attorney for Isidoro Caballo, curator <i>ad litem<\/i> of the minors Emiliano, Policronia and Petronilo Caballo, and counsel for Nazario and Celerina Caballo, Gregoria Dandoy and her husband Ciriaco Partis and Demetria Dandoy, filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance of Bohol, setting forth that the spouses Geronimo Dandoy and Gertrudis Semano had died intestate more than twenty years before, and had at their death left in the pueblo of Baclayon of the said province a parcel of land 9 <i>brazas<\/i> in width by 12 in length, bounded on the north by the lot of Narciso Ca\u00f1ete and Catalino Pates, on the south by Washington Street, on the east by a lot of Narciso Ca\u00f1ete, and on the west by that of Fruto Alarba; a house of mixed materials, constructed on said land; a wooden bed, and a glass lamp; all of which property was worth P500; that the said deceased spouses had three children who, upon the death of their parents, came into possession of the property aforementioned and of their rights and obligations as sole heirs; they were named Dominga, Juan, and Cipriano Dandoy, of whom Juan also died and left two children, Gregoria and Demetria, who likewise succeeded to their rights in the aforementioned property; that afterwards, more than eight years ago, Juan's sister, Dominga Dandoy, also died in the same pueblo and was succeeded by her only daughter, Juana Dandoy, who likewise subsequently died in the said pueblo and left five children, Nazario, Emiliano, Policronia, Petronilo, and Celerina, surnamed Caballo, which children succeeded their mother, Juana, as her heirs, and inherited her rights in the said property; that, after the death of the spouses, Geronimo Dandoy and Gertrudis Semano, the property specified in the complaint remained intact; and after the death of Dominga and Juan the said property still remained to be divided between the defendant Cipriano Dandoy and the successors in interest of the two aforesaid deceased persons, two-thirds belonging to the plaintiffs and the remaining third to Cipriano Dandoy; that the latter, with no right and without the consent of the plaintiffs, sold the said property, in 1908, to Fruto Alarba who, knowing that it was not owned exclusively by Cipriano, purchased it and exercised dominion over the same, against the plaintiffs' will; that, both prior and subsequent to the sale, the partition of the said property having been demanded of Cipriano Dandoy, he refused to accede to such demand and, up to the date of the complaint, had continued so to refuse, thereby causing to the plaintiffs losses and damages to the amount of P500; that also the defendant Alarba, after the purchase,\u00a0 declined to divide the said property, resulting in additional loss to the plaintiffs; wherefore counsel for the latter asked that judgment be rendered in favor of his clients awarding the property described in the complaint to the deceased spouses Geronimo Dandoy and Gertrudis Semano; that both the plaintiffs and the defendant Cipriano Dandoy were the heirs and, as such, the owners <i>pro indiviso<\/i> of the said property; and further requested that, after annulment of the said sale, it be ordered that the property in question be divided between the plaintiffs and the defendant Dandoy, or, should such partition of the property not be feasible, that it be ordered sold and the proceeds divided in legal shares among the said heirs, and that the defendants be sentenced to pay to each one of the plaintiffs an indemnity of P500 as losses and damages, and the costs.<br\/><br\/>The demurrer filed by counsel for the defendants having been overruled, the attorney for Cipriano Dandoy in his answer denied generally and specifically all of the facts alleged in the complaint, with the exception of those clearly admitted and, as a special defense, alleged:\u00a0 That the spouses Antonio Geronimo Dandoy and Juana Gertrudis Dolores Semano, at the time of their death more than thirty years ago, left three legitimate children, named Dominga, Juan, and Cipriano, and three parcels of land situated, the first, in the barrio of Cambayado, pueblo of Baclayon, and bounded on the north by the land of Catalino Pates, on the south by a thoroughfare, on the east by the property of Clemente Realista, and on the west by that of Faustino Buhion; the second, in the barrio of Baclayon, of the pueblo of the same name, bounded on the north by the main highway, on the south by the seashore, on the east by the Bahabaha <i>estero<\/i>, and on the west by the land of Isidro Semano; and the third parcel, within the town, bounded on the north by the land of Catalino Pates, on the south by America Street, on the east by the property of Demetrio Narciso Ginete, and on the west by that of Fruto Alarba, on which parcel there was a house constructed of mixed materials; that, prior to the death of the said spouses, their son, Juan Dandoy, occupied the first parcel of land, Dominga Dandoy the second parcel, and Cipriano Dandoy the third parcel aforementioned; that, after the death of the said spouses, their children divided the said three parcels of land among themselves, each of them taking what he had occupied for more than twenty years, and that the parcel which fell to Dominga was in the possession of her husband, Isidoro Caballo; that Cipriano Dandoy, to whom in the partition the third parcel was allotted, which he held in good faith peaceably and publicly as the owner thereof, sold the same in 1898 to Fruto Alarba, and that Juana and Dominga Dandoy, the plaintiffs' predecessors in interest, each received a wooden bed and a glass lamp, which came to them in the division made.\u00a0 Therefore, said counsel for Cipriano Dandoy requested that judgment be rendered absolving the latter from the complaint and sentencing the plaintiffs to recognize the ownership and possession of the said house and lot which Cipriano Dandoy had enjoyed up to 1898, to hold their peace forever, and to pay the costs.<br\/><br\/>The other defendant, Fruto Alarba, in his written answer, denied generally and specifically each and all of the facts contained in each and all of the allegations of the complaint, with the exception of those clearly admitted hereinafter.\u00a0 As a special defense he alleged that the correct description of the land is as follows:\u00a0 A parcel of land within the town, bounded on the north by the property of Catalino Pates, on the south by America Street, on the east by the land of Nemesio Narciso Ginete, and on the west by that of Fruto Alarba, on which lot there is a house constructed of mixed materials; that the said house and lot were purchased in 1898 from Cipriano Dandoy and since then he had been in quiet, peaceable, public, and continued possession adverse to the petitioner as the owner thereof, and that the plaintiffs were not entitled to ask for the nullification of the said sale.\u00a0 This defendant, therefore, requested that judgment be rendered in his behalf by sentencing the plaintiffs to recognize his ownership and possession of the said house and lot, to hold their peace forever, and to pay the costs.<br\/><br\/>The motion presented by the plaintiffs having been overruled, the case came to trial and, after the introduction of evidence by the parties, the court rendered the judgment aforementioned, to which the defendants excepted and presented a written petition for the annulment of the said judgment and for a new trial, upon the grounds set forth.\u00a0 This motion was overruled, exception was entered by the appellants, who presented the proper bill of exceptions, which was approved and forwarded to the clerk of this\u00a0 court.<br\/><br\/>The action brought by the plaintiffs against the defendant Cipriano Dandoy, their coheir in the intestate succession of the deceased Geronimo Dandoy and Juana Gertrudis Dolores Semano, the ancestors and predecessors in interest of the litigants, must be characterized as an action for partition of an inheritance.\u00a0 They agree that the house and lot in question, sold by the defendant Cipriano Dandoy to his codefendant, Fruto Alarba, originally belonged to those deceased spouses, Geronimo and Juana, from whom they derive their rights in this property of disputed\u00a0 ownership.<br\/><br\/>The record does not show satisfactory proof that, during the lifetime of the original owners of the house and lot in litigation, a partition of their property was made among their three children, named Dominga, Juan, and Cipriano, or that the said house and lot were awarded to the defendant Cipriano, as he alleges.<br\/><br\/>It is\u00a0 neither natural nor likely that, while the parents were still living, a partition of their property\u00a0 was made among their children, as averred by the defendant, because it does not appear from the record that, after the alleged division of the property of the parents among their three children, there remained any part thereof which might have afforded subsistence for the parents, especially since the latter were not rich or had any other property or means whereby to obtain a livelihood.<br\/><br\/>Aside from this, the evidence adduced at the trial does not substantiate the defendant's allegation that such partition of\u00a0 the property was made and that, besides the house and lot which the defendant Cipriano appropriated to the prejudice of his coheirs, there existed other property belonging to his deceased parents, and that, in the alleged division, such other property was allotted respectively to his brother and sister, Juan and Dominga, whose rights are now represented by the plaintiffs.<br\/><br\/>The partition of an estate determines the property belonging to each heir; so long as such partition has not been made, the property belongs to them all in common.<br\/><br\/>For this reason, the house and lot in question have the status of <i>pro indiviso<\/i> property, common to the three heirs of the said deceased, and, on this hypothesis, the defendant Cipriano Dandoy could make no absolute disposal of the two-thirds of the property, without the consent of his coowners, to whom such part belongs; as Cipriano is the owner of only one-third, he could not dispose of the entire property or sell it, without the consent of\u00a0 his coowners, to the other defendant, Fruto Alarba, to whom he could transmit no owner's rights whatever except with respect to one-third of the said land and house, two-thirds of which unquestionably belong to his legitimate coheirs between whom the same must be divided.<br\/><br\/>The right to an inheritance is transmitted immediately to the heirs by operation of law, at the moment of the death of their predecessor in interest.\u00a0 Possession of hereditary property belonging to several heirs, but held by one of them only, is understood to be enjoyed by him in the name and representation of his coheirs, for they are all entitled to be regarded as coowners of the common property.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, refuting the errors assigned to the judgment appealed\u00a0 from, we hereby affirm the same as being in accord with the law and the evidence, with the costs against the appellants.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

MANUEL CIRIA Y VINANT, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">Various\u00a0 documents and certified portions of the record from the proceedings in the Court of First Instance of this city in the probate of the will of the deceased Mrs. Luz Ciria Reyes have been forwarded here in connection with the appeal from the decision of October 2, 1912, filed by counsel for Rafael Reyes; also, the written assignment of errors on appeal, and therein it is requested that in printing the evidence all the proofs submitted in the probate proceedings be included with the transcript of the stenographic notes in the case.\u00a0 But in view thereof counsel for Manuel Ciria, appellee, objects to the printing of all the proofs presented at the trial, consisting of public documents, letters, post cards, accounts, and stenographic notes, as appellant requests in paragraph 8 of his petition, on the ground that such is not according to the rules.<br\/><br\/>In another petition counsel for the same Manuel Ciria asks that the court disallow said appeal, because it has been raised at an improper time, and even had it been, the judgment appealed from is not final, for it contains no statement of the hereditary property nor of the proportional part, expressed in number and amount, belonging to Manuel Ciria. Hence, to shorten the proceedings and avoid a new appeal that may be taken as a result of the division of the property, the procedure in the Court of First Instance should be terminated by compelling the testamentary executor to submit the itemized inventory of the property of the inheritance, appraisal thereof by commissioners and indication of the amount that would appear for the heir Manuel Ciria.\u00a0 Therefore the appeal is improper until final judgment of partition has been rendered,\u00a0 which has not yet been done.<br\/><br\/>It is to be noted that by the order\u00a0 appealed from of October 2, 1912, Manuel Ciria y Vinant is declared to be heir by force of law of the deceased Luz Ciria, with right to share in her property to the extent the law authorizes and, by a supplementary order of\u00a0 the\u00a0 28th of the same month and year, the share to which the said heir is declared to be entitled is one-sixth of the property of the conjugal partnership between said deceased and the appellant Reyes.<br\/><br\/>The only question for the court to decide now is whether the judgment of October 2, 1912, supplemented by the order of the 28th of the same month and year, is in\u00a0 itself final and therefore susceptible of appeal, or whether it is not, as appellee contends.<br\/><br\/>Said judgment of October 2 with its supplement determines two important points of law essentially affecting the interest of the litigants, to wit:\u00a0 (1) The declaration that Manuel Ciria y Vinant is heir\u00a0 by force of law of the deceased Luz Ciria; and (2) the declaration that the claimant as such heir is entitled to one-sixth of the property of the conjugal partnership between said deceased and the appellant Rafael Reyes.<br\/><br\/>If in due time this judgment should become final, there can be no question that the controversy between the parties would be finally settled, as it would also be finally decided by reversal on this pending appeal, should final decision be handed down in the case that the said Manuel Ciria y Vinant is not entitled to the inheritance from the deceased Luz Ciria.<br\/><br\/>Section 782 of the Code of Civil Procedure prescribes the following:<br\/><blockquote><i>\"Appeal from decree of distribution<\/i>.\u2014If there shall be a controversy before the Court of First Instance as to who the lawful heirs of the deceased person are, or as to the distributive share to which each person is entitled under the law, the testimony as to such controversy shall be taken in writing by the judge, under oath, and signed by the witnesses.\u00a0 Any party in interest whose distributive share is affected by the determination\u00a0 of such controversy may appeal from the judgment of the Court of First Instance determining such controversy to the Supreme Court, within the time and in the manner provided in the last preceding section, and it shall thereupon be the duty of the clerk of the Court of First Instance forthwith to transmit to the Supreme Court a certified copy of all the testimony taken upon that issue, and of the judgment of the court thereon,\"<\/blockquote>Manuel Ciria's claim regarding his right to inherit from the deceased Luz Ciria to the extent fixed by law is dealt with in the probate proceedings on her account.\u00a0 The testamentary heir appealed from the decision of the judge recognizing such right, and this appeal of his, duly interposed, must be admitted and heard in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing section of the law of\u00a0 procedure, perfectly applicable to the case, for the testamentary inheritance of the appellant Reyes is substantially affected by the judgment; and in granting the right to appeal from said judgment to this court, within the time and in the manner provided by the next preceding section 781, said section directs that the clerk of the Court of First Instance shall immediately transmit to the clerk of this court a certified copy of all the testimony taken upon that issue and of the judgment of the court.<br\/><br\/>The decision of the court, therefore, declaring Manuel Ciria heir of the testatrix with right to one-sixth of the conjugal partnership property belonging to her is final as a declaration of heirship, and as such is susceptible of exception and the consequent appeal.\u00a0 Nor should this appeal be postponed or hearing thereon suspended but it should\u00a0 be carried forward at once without delay\u00a0 or hindrance, as provided in the section cited from the law of procedure.<br\/><br\/>It is neither rational nor just that final partition of the property in litigation should await settlement of the controversy pending over a right to inherit, when this partition really depends upon the determination of who are the heirs that are entitled to the hereditary property.\u00a0 Appellee's right to inherit from the testatrix depends upon affirmation of the judgment appealed\u00a0 from, for otherwise partition of the property of the inheritance in litigation would be unnecessary.<br\/><br\/>In view of these facts, we hold that there is no ground for disallowing the appeal interposed by Rafael Reyes as requested by counsel for Manuel Ciria, and for the carrying forward of said appeal it is proper to print the\u00a0 will, documents, record, and testimony to which appellant's petition refers along with the statement of errors it assigns, with exception of the documents, letters, and post cards mentioned in appellee's petition of December 9 last.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

save only chapter 42, which is devoted to \"Appeals in Special Proceedings.\"<br\/><br\/>In the present case, it is presumed, at least, that the administration of the estate has reached the point where an order of distribution is proper.\u00a0 If, therefore, there be anything lacking in the order of distribution essential to the distribution of the estate, the order is fatally deficient.\u00a0 If any further order or decree is required, it is not final.<br\/><br\/>Section 753 provides that the order of distribution \"shall name the persons and <i>proportions or parts to which each is entitled.<\/i>\"\u00a0 Does the order or decree of the court in the present case comply with these directions?\u00a0 That it has decided who the lawful heirs of the deceased are is not questioned.\u00a0 It has, therefore, complied with the law\u00a0 to that extent.\u00a0 But the order is also required to designate the proportions or parts to which each person is entitled.\u00a0 The order sets out that Ciria is entitled to\u00a0 one-sixth of the conjugal property. This cannot by any means be considered as <i>distributing<\/i> the estate.\u00a0 To say to Reyes that he is entitled to five-sixths of the estate, and to Ciria that he is entitled to one-sixth of the estate is merely affording a basis, a rule of division, and not the division itself.\u00a0 It leaves the estate where it is found.\u00a0 It divides nothing.\u00a0 It no more complies with the law than would an order decreeing that all children of the deceased were entitled to equal shares in the estate without naming them.<br\/><br\/>Section 762 provides in part:<br\/><blockquote>\"Upon the filing of the petition the court or judge shall appoint a committee to make the partition and the proceedings of such committee, and of the court in its action upon the report of the committee, shall be in all respects the same as those in this Code provided for partition of real estate by action.\"<\/blockquote>This directs that the proceedings of the committee and the action of the court upon its report shall be the same as is provided for partition of real estate by action.\u00a0 Sections 181 <i>et seq<\/i>.\u00a0 regulate the partition of real estate.\u00a0 Section 194 requires:<br\/><blockquote>\"The record of the final judgment in such action shall state definitely by metes and bounds and adequate description, the particular portion of the estate that is assigned to each party to the action, if partition is made; if the whole estate is assigned to one of the parties upon his paying to the other party the sum ordered by the court, the record shall state the fact of such payment, and of the assignment of the estate to the party making such payment.\u00a0 If the estate is sold, and the sale is confirmed by the court, the record shall state the name of the purchaser or purchasers and a definite description of the parcels of the estate\u00a0 sold to each purchaser.\"<\/blockquote>In short, the code specifically requires that an order of distribution shall distribute; that it shall set forth exactly those facts which the petitioner claims are lacking from the order or decree in the present case; that is, a statement of the hereditary property and of the proportional part, expressed in number and amount, belonging to each heir.\u00a0 Whatever else the order contains which satisfies the court of its finality, it certainly does not contain those facts which are required of it by the\u00a0 code.\u00a0 Nevertheless, the court has approved it, and makes the statement that,<br\/><blockquote>\"If in due time this judgment should become final, there can be no question that the controversy between the parties would be finally settled.\"<\/blockquote>Is this conclusion correct?\u00a0 Let us\u00a0 suppose that the appeal which is thus allowed results in affirming the order of the lower court.\u00a0 What is settled?\u00a0 According to the court, the order decides (1) that Ciria is an heir, and (2) that\u00a0 as such heir he is entitled to one-sixth of the estate.\u00a0 These are the only points decided.\u00a0 The order appealed from being affirmed, the record will\u00a0 be remanded for execution.\u00a0 But it cannot be executed because the estate has not been divided or distributed.\u00a0 It cannot be divided or distributed because a committee has never been appointed as provided by law; the estate has never been appraised; and\u00a0 the\u00a0 heirs (nor anyone else for that matter) know nothing of what portions of the estate they are to receive.\u00a0 Clearly, these steps must all be taken\u00a0 before delivery can be made to Ciria of one-sixth of the property belonging to the estate.\u00a0 They can only be taken in the manner provided by law; that is, by the appointment of a committee to appraise the estate and to divide the same; then, the submission of its report to the court, which may accept it in whole or in part, reject it, or make such order as it may see\u00a0 fit.\u00a0 (Sec. 189.) Form and effect can be given to the action of the court only by a final judgment or order.\u00a0 But the difficulty with this proceeding is that all of these things are by the code directed to be included in the first order; that is, the order in which the court declared Ciria to be an heir and entitled to one-sixth of the estate.\u00a0 To my mind, this is a flagrant disregard of the provisions of the Code.\u00a0 It splits\u00a0 up into two separate proceedings that which the law directs shall be done in one.\u00a0 It allows two appeals where only one is provided by law, unless this court rules that when the record is returned and proceedings looking to the partition of the estate are instituted,\u00a0 no appeal will lie from the action of the committee and of the lower court in such partition proceedings.\u00a0 I cannot believe that the court will go so far.\u00a0 Nevertheless, when it grants an appeal in the partition proceedings, it will in effect admit that the decree which it now holds to be the final action of the court was not final.<br\/><br\/>Again, it will be noted that section 782, <i>supra<\/i>, provides that \"any party in interest whose distributive share is affected by the determination of such controversy may appeal from the judgment of the Court of First Instance determining such controversy.\"\u00a0 By express provision there must be a determination of the controversy before an appeal will lie, and this determination must necessarily be a judicial one.\u00a0 Such a determination can only mean the end; the conclusion of the controversy.\u00a0 When the controversy has been brought to an end, or has been concluded, it has\u00a0 been definitely settled; that is, every phase or part of the controversy has been determined.\u00a0 It cannot be said that the controversy has been finally ended if there be any part of it undetermined.\u00a0 The distribution of the property is the predominating part of the controversy, as will be seen from the heading of the section.\u00a0 \"Distribution\" is the act of dividing or making an apportionment. (<i>In re<\/i> Creighton, 12 Neb., 280.) In general, the term \"distribution,\" when applied to the estate of a deceased person, refers to the <i>ultimate<\/i> division of the estate of the deceased among the next of kin in case of intestacy, or among the beneficiaries under a will, after the estate is free from debt.\u00a0 (Thomson <i>vs<\/i>. Tracy, 60 N. Y., .31.)<br\/><br\/>The concurring opinion in the case at bar reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"I base my concurrence upon the provisions of section 782 of the\u00a0 Code of Civil Procedure.\u00a0 They are clear, specific, and mandatory and conclusive of the question. Moreover, this court has, on several occasions, tacitly held proper the appeal here in question.\u00a0 (Conde <i>vs<\/i>. Abaya, 13 Phil. Rep.,249; In the matter of the intestate estate of Malignad, 11 Phil. Rep., 158; Moreno <i>vs<\/i>. Gruet, 1 Phil. Rep., 217; Thunga Chui <i>vs<\/i>. Que Bentec, 1 Phil.\u00a0 Rep., 356; Domingo m Warden of Bilibid, 1 Phil. Rep., 542; Alemany <i>vs<\/i>. Sweeney, 2 Phil. Rep., 654.) Although in these cases the question was not discussed, still the court must have held that the orders were appealable or it would have had no jurisdiction to decide the case on the merits.\u00a0 The decisions in Montemayor <i>vs<\/i>. Cunanan (14 Phil. Rep., 454); Toribio <i>vs<\/i>. Toribio (7\u00a0 Phil. Rep., 526); Ron <i>vs<\/i>. Mojica (8 Phil. Rep., 328); Insular Government <i>vs<\/i>. Bishop of Nueva Segovia (17 Phil. Rep., 487), and other cases of the same nature are not in conflict with this decision, as they refer to appeals in ordinary actions taken under other sections of the Code of Civil Procedure which expressly prohibit appeals in such cases, and do not refer to appeals on special proceedings such as is the one at bar.\"<\/blockquote>\"They (the provisions of section 782) are clear, specific, and mandatory, and conclusive of the question.\"\u00a0 With this statement I fully agree.\u00a0 Said provisions are clear and specific in that they clearly and specifically state that an appeal will only lie from the decree of distribution and not from incidental orders which are necessary to be entered and which are integral parts of the final decree of distribution.\u00a0 They are mandatory in that they direct that each and every part of the controversy must be settled before an appeal\u00a0 will lie.<br\/><br\/>\"Moreover, this court has, on several occasions, tacitly held proper the appeal here in question.\"\u00a0 A number of cases are cited in support of this assertion.<br\/><br\/>The first is that of Conde <i>vs<\/i>. Abaya (13\u00a0 Phil. Rep., 249).\u00a0 In that case the court declared that Conde was the sole heir of the deceased Casiano Abaya, and was entitled to all the property of the said deceased.\u00a0 The administrator was directed to act accordingly.\u00a0 From this judgment Roman Abaya appealed to the Supreme Court.\u00a0 It is clear that the order appealed from was a final decree of distribution; a declaration of heirs had been made and the property directed to be turned over to the sole heir. Every question had been finally settled in the court below before the appeal was entered.<br\/><br\/>In the next case, <i>In re<\/i> Estate of Malignad (11 Phil. Rep., 158), the commissioners appointed to divide the property submitted their report to the court and the same was approved.\u00a0 From the order of the court approving' this division an appeal was entered.\u00a0 This case directly supports my position in the case at bar. There was a final order of distribution in which the commissioners said that they had divided the property set forth in the inventory into two parts almost mathematically equal.\u00a0 This was likewise a final decree of distribution.<br\/><br\/>In Moreno <i>vs<\/i>. Gruet (1 Phil. Rep., 217), the decision of the court relates solely to a motion to dismiss an appeal from an order removing a guardian, and has no connection whatever with appeals brought under section 782.\u00a0 The only time this section is mentioned or referred to in any manner is where the court said that article 782 is limited to orders directing the partition of property.\u00a0 Any bearing that this case has upon the question involved in the case at bar is clearly against the position taken by the majority of the court in the present case, since it was declared in the former that section 782 is limited to orders directing the <i>partition<\/i> of property.<br\/><br\/>In the next case, Thunga Chui <i>vs<\/i>. Que Bentec (1 Phil. Rep., 356), the following quotation\u00a0 from the syllabus is sufficient to show that it is entirely inapplicable:<br\/><blockquote>\"Where the only exception taken was an exception to the judgment, the appellate court has no power to review the evidence, and a motion to include the evidence in the bill of exceptions will be denied.\"<\/blockquote>In the next case, Domingo <i>vs<\/i>. Warden of Bilibid (1 Phil. Rep., 542), the syllabus\u00a0 reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"<i>Habeas corpus<\/i> is a special proceeding in which no appeal has been provided for by the Code of Civil Procedure.\"<\/blockquote>Section 782 is incidentally referred to as permitting appeals from <i>decrees of distribution<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>The syllabus in the last case, Alemany <i>vs<\/i>. Sweeney (2 Phil. Rep., 654), reads in part as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"A petition for a writ of mandamus to compel a judge of First Instance to allow an appeal from an order removing petitioners from their office of guardian\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 is not subject to demurrer on the ground that the facts related do not constitute a cause of action.\"<\/blockquote>This case had nothing whatever to do with section 782, but was brought under section 783.<br\/><br\/>The result is that not a single one of the cases cited support the proposition that an appeal from a decree of distribution which does not contain a proposed division of the property is proper.\u00a0 But, on the\u00a0 contrary, all of the said cases show that this\u00a0 court has\u00a0 always treated the appeals provided for in section 782 as being appeals from decrees of final distribution, and not appeals from incidental orders or decrees, as the one in the case at bar.<br\/><br\/>It is\u00a0 said that the decisions in Montemayor <i>vs<\/i>. Cunanan (14 Phil. Rep.,.454), Toribio <i>vs<\/i>. Toribio (7 Phil. Rep., 526), Ron <i>vs<\/i>. Mojica (8 Phil. Rep., 328), Insular Government <i>vs<\/i>. Bishop of Nueva Segovia (17 Phil. Rep., 487), and other cases of the same nature are not in conflict with the decision of the court in the case under consideration.<br\/><br\/>In Montemayor <i>vs<\/i>. Cunanan, Montemayor commenced an action against her husband\u00a0 for a divorce and for a division of the marital property.\u00a0 Judgment was rendered granting the divorce, dissolving the conjugal partnership, and\u00a0 directing that the property be divided in accordance with the law.\u00a0 From this judgment an appeal was taken The appellee filed a motion in this Supreme Court asking that the appeal be dismissed upon the ground that the judgment appealed from was not final.\u00a0 This petition was granted, and the appeal dismissed, the court saying:<br\/><blockquote>\"It will be noted also that these sections provide for an appeal only upon a judgment which '<i>finally determines the action or proceeding<\/i>.'\u00a0 This phrase, '<i>final judgment disposing of\u00a0 the action or proceeding,'<\/i> seems to be significant.\u00a0 The evident purpose of the legislature in using this phrase was to prevent (except in very extreme cases) appeals from n order, decree, or judgment of the lower court which <i>disposed of only a part of the proceeding\u00a0 or action<\/i>.\u00a0 Appeals always mean delay in the final determination of causes.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 In the present case the plaintiff was attempting to seek (<i>a<\/i>) a divorce, and (<i>b<\/i>) a division of the conjugal property.\u00a0 The court granted the divorce.\u00a0 If an appeal should be allowed against that decree, then it would be useless to proceed to a division of the conjugal property until after the question whether or not the plaintiff was entitled to her divorce was settled on the appeal.\u00a0 And then suppose the Supreme Court should affirm the decree of the lower court and return the cause for further proceedings, and in settling the second question with reference to the division of\u00a0 the conjugal property, one or both of the parties might claim that an error was committed, they would then be entitled to another appeal against that order or decree of the lower court and have the case brought to this court again.\"<\/blockquote>It appears to me that the reasons given for dismissing the appeal in this case are perfectly applicable to the case at bar.\u00a0 The principle that an appeal will not lie from an order or judgment which does not finally determine the action or proceeding is the same in each case.\u00a0 In the one the divorce was granted, but no actual division of the property had been made.\u00a0 In the other, Ciria was declared to be an heir but no actual division of the property had been made.\u00a0 In the first the court dismissed the appeal upon the ground that the judgment appealed from was not final, while in the second it is held that the order is final. Logically, the two holdings are absolutely inconsistent, and, in my opinion, the latter is openly and manifestly against the law.<br\/><br\/>An examination of the other cases will show that this court has steadfastly held to the principle that an appeal will not lie from any order or judgment of the trial courts which does not finally determine the action or proceedings.<br\/><br\/>The decision in this case permits two appeals where only one is provided by the code.\u00a0 It at least doubles the time necessary for the distribution of the estate.\u00a0 It will have the effect of depriving the heirs of the enjoyment of the estate for a long\u00a0 time, and will increase the expense of administration and decrease the net value of the estate.\u00a0 It is a notorious fact that in this jurisdiction it is an exceedingly difficult and tedious task to wind up the affairs of the estates of deceased persons, and that\u00a0 in many instances several years elapse before they are finally disposed of.\u00a0 Both the Legislature and the courts are endeavoring to reduce this time and dispose of the estates promptly.\u00a0 But now this court, in a strained and unwarranted construction of section 782, indefinitely extends the time for the winding up of estates of deceased persons.\u00a0 The decision is not only in conflict with every other decision of this court upon the principle of finality of judgments, but it is, in my opinion, absolutely in conflict with the plain provisions of section 782.\u00a0 Knowing the disastrous effects which must necessarily flow from this holding is the reason which has prompted me to record my dissent at length.<br\/><br\/>The appeal should be dismissed with instructions to the lower court to proceed with the distribution of the estate in the manner provided by law.<\/div>",

FRANCISCO ECO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/> D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>PER CURIAM:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\"> This is an appeal by Francisco Eco from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of the province of Ambos Camarines, condemning him to six months of arresto mayor and to the payment of the costs of the cause, for the crime of estafa.<br\/><br\/>It is insisted by the government that the appellant obtained from one Felipe Marasigan a carabao worth P100., through falsely representing to Marasigan that he had paid the attorney who represented the said Marasigan in the Supreme Court in a certain criminal case P200, while on the other hand the appellant contends that he paid Mr. Contreras P200. for his services as counsel for Marasigan in the Court of First Instance. All agree that if the contention of the appellant is correct he is not guilty of estafa, as he was authorized by Marasigan to secure the services of Mr. Contreras as Marasigan's attorney in the Court of First Instance. But if the carabao was received from Marasigan by the appellant upon representations of the latter to the effect that he had paid attorneys in Manila to represent Marasigan in the Supreme Court, then quite a different question arises, as it is admitted that Marasigan was represented in this Supreme Court by counsel de oficio. A careful examination of the testimony is necessary in order to determine these questions.<br\/><br\/>In 1908 and 1909 the appellant was Presidente of the Municipality of Paracale, and Felipe Marasigan was Justice of the Peace of that town. A criminal complaint was filed against Marasigan charging him with having falsified various public documents and failed to account for moneys collected in his capacity as Justice of the Peace, eco and Marasigan being close friends at that time, the former, with the knowledge and consent of the latter, consulted with Contreras with a view to securring the services of Contreras to represent Marasigan in the Court of First Instance. Marasigan was released on bail, eco being one of his bondsman. The trial of the cause was held in Daet in February 1910. Here again Eco discussed with Contreras the matter of the defense of Marasigan. Contreras represented Marasigan in the trial of that cause, at the conclusion of which Marasigan was sentenced to imprisonment for fourteen years, eight months and one day, and to pay a fine of P1500. From this judgment Marasigan appealed to the Supreme court, where, as we have said, Marasigan was represented by counsel de oficio. The Supreme Court reversed the decision of the lower court and dismissed the case against Marasigan.<br\/><br\/>Upon the conviction of Marasigan in the Court of First Instance, Eco again signed Marasigan's bond and secured another bondsman. Marasigan was then allowed his liberty during the pendency of the case in the Supreme Court. eco also took up with Contreras the question of handling the case on appeal. Contreras came to Manila as a member of the Philippine Assemby, and Eco, at the request of Marasigan, came to Manila also in the month of December 1910 or January 1911, for the purpose of consulting with Contreras with reference to Marasigan's case then pending on appeal. On his arrival here he took up the matter with Contreras, and Contreras gave Eco to understand that Mr. Lukban would look after Marasigan's case. That saome such arrangement was actually made is clearly evidenced by exhibit 1, being a document of Marasigan acknowledging receipt of a letter from Lukban asking a remittance of P200. to pay for a copy of the testimony. After eco returned to Paracale Marasigan turned over to him the Lukban letter, and Eco wrote to Contreras concerning the matter. Neither Eco nor Marasigan heard anything further about the latter's case until on April 1, 1911, when eco received the following telegram from Contreras:<br\/><br\/><div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\"Tell Marasigan that his case has been dismissed by the Supreme Court.\"<br\/><\/div><br\/>On receipt of this information Marasigan proceeded to call in a number of his friends, including eco, and bought a quantity of wine and celebrated the occasion. This ended the proceedings against Marasigan, leaving only the question of paying the attorneys. Up to this time Contreras, attorney for Marasigan, had received but P40. for his services. This services had included various consultations in Nueva Caceres, a trip from Nueva Caceres to daet, the trial of the case at that point, and such intervention as he had taken in the appeal.<br\/><br\/>Eco testified that at the time they were celebrating the good news contained in the telegram heretofore mentioned, he called Marasigan's attention to the fact that he, Marasigan, had better make arrangements for the payment of Contreras' fees, which he, eco, had guaranteed. Nothing appears to have been done further until August 1911, when Eco went to Nueva Caceres to take the Justice of the Peace examination. Here he met Contreras P100. on Marasigan's Account, remitting P100 y mail from Paracale in September of that year. These two payments, together with the P40. paid by Marasigan, amounted\u00a0 to P240., the full amount of Contreras' bill. The P200. which Eco agreed to guarantee did not include the P40. paid by Marasigan. During August also, and while Eco was in Nueva Caceres, Marasigan caused the carabao in question to be delivered to Juan Eco, brother of the appellant, in partial payment of the advances made or to be made on his account.<br\/><br\/>When Marasigan was informed that he had been represented in the Supreme court by counsel de oficio he proceeded to accuse Eco of having obtained the possession of the carabao by falsely representing that he, Eco, had spent P200. in employing counsel to represent Marasigan in the Supreme Court. certain investigations were made with reference to this matter by the Provincial Fiscal of Ambos Camarines, and in February 1912 the carabao, not having been legally transferred to Eco, was returned to Marasigan. On April 26, 1912, the complaint which forms the basis of this criminal action was filed against Eco for estafa of the carabao.<br\/><br\/>To establish that Eco had represented that he had spent P200. on the marasigan appeal, the prosecution presented three witnesses, namely, Felipe Marasigan, Crisanto Oco, and Pedro Veluz. On a close examination of the testimony of these three witnesses it will be found that the whole case virtually rests upon the unsupported declaration of Marasigan, the prosecuting witness. On page 4 of the testimony Marasigan states:<br\/><blockquote><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"> <tbody><tr valign=\"top\"> <td width=\"10%\">\"A. <\/td> <td width=\"90%\"><div align=\"justify\">He asked me three times to pay him P200.

Oco attempted to corroborate the testimony of Marasigan as to the demand for the carabao, but he did not fix either the time or place of the demand, and finally testified that the carabao was worth P200., whereas Marasigan never did contend that the animal was worth more than P100.<br\/><br\/>The witness Pedro Veluz testified in part as follows:<br\/><blockquote><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"> <tbody><tr valign=\"top\"> <td width=\"10%\">\"Q.<\/td> <td width=\"90%\"> <div align=\"justify\">Do you remember of having been present when Eco demanded of Marasigan the payment of P200.?<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>A.<\/td> <td> <div align=\"justify\">Yes sir.<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>Q. <\/td> <td><div align=\"justify\">For what were the P200. which Eco demanded of Marasigan?<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>A.<\/td> <td> <div align=\"justify\">To pay a lawyer of the Supreme Court.<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>Q.<\/td> <td> <div align=\"justify\">What month more or less was this demand made?<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>A. <\/td> <td><div align=\"justify\">The 9th of September at 6:30.<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>Q.<\/td> <td> <div align=\"justify\">What year?<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>A.<\/td> <td> <div align=\"justify\">1911.<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>Q.<\/td> <td> <div align=\"justify\">On September 9th at 6:30 sharp?<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>A. <\/td> <td><div align=\"justify\">Yes sir.<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>Q.<\/td> <td> <div align=\"justify\">Did you see your watch?<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>A.<\/td> <td> <div align=\"justify\">Yes sir, I always carry a watch.<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>Q.<\/td> <td> <div align=\"justify\">Isn't it true that you testified in the Justice of the Peace court in the preliminary investigation that you know nothing about the P200. until after you left the house when Marasigan told you about it?<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>A.<\/td> <td> <div align=\"justify\">My testimony from the first in the Justice of the Peace court was that the collection of the P200. was for the payment of a lawyer who defended in the Supreme Court.<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>Q. <\/td> <td><div align=\"justify\">Reading your declaration made before the Justice of the Peace in the preliminary investigation in Paracale-- ' When we left the house of Eco, Marasigan told me that he owed Eco P200. for having paid the lawyers' fees.'<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>A.<\/td> <td> <div align=\"justify\">Yes sir.<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>Q.<\/td> <td> <div align=\"justify\">Then what you have just testified is a little inexact?<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>A. <\/td> <td><div align=\"justify\">Yes sir, because when we left the house Pilar was trying to collect from Marasigan P200.<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>Q. <\/td> <td><div align=\"justify\">Who is Pilar?<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>A. <\/td> <td><div align=\"justify\">Their companion in the house.\"<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <\/tbody><\/table><\/blockquote>This witness in fact admits that he knew nothing of the P200. except what had been told him by Marasigan.<br\/><br\/>Eco testified that he returned to Paracale from Manila the latter part of February 1911. Marasigan states that it was in March, and that Eco then told him he had been absolved by the Supreeme Court. That this statement of Marasigan's is false is established in two ways-- First, the case of the United States vs. Marasigan, R.G. 5989, was not decided by this court until March 16, 1911, and the notice thereof was mailed to Ramon Salinas and the Attorney-General on March 17th. The record was returned to the Clerk of the Court of First Instance of Ambos Camarines\u00a0 on March 17th, and acknowledged by him on March 29th. Contreras was doubtless advised by the Clerk shortly afterwards and immediately sent the telegram of April 1st to eco. Second, Attorney Lukban wrote Marasigan asking for P200. with which to pay for a copy of the testimony. The fact of this letter is testified to by Contreras, by Eco, and admitted by Marasigan. Eco testified that on his return to Paracale in February 1911 he answered this letter on behalf of Marasigan. This is uncontradicted. It is evident that such answer would have been absurd had Eco brought the news with him that Marasigan had been acquitted by the Supreme Court.<br\/><br\/>More palpably false than the above however is Marasigan's attempted denial of having been shown a telegram from Contreras announcing his acquittal. He says:<br\/><blockquote>\"He (Eco) did not show me any telegram. How could he show a telegram if everyone was drunk?\"<\/blockquote>Marasigan admits they were drunk, and then asked how, being drunk, they could see the telegram. If the evidence establishes any one point conclusively it is that it was the receipt of the telegram that caused the drunkenness. The testimony of record shows that at the time the telegram was received, Marasigan asked Eco to advance for him the P200. to Contreras. Again, the record shows that when Marasigan was tried for falsification of a public document, he was accompanied to Daet by Eco and by Agapito G. Fierro. At Daet Eco and Marasigan lived together and Eco testified during the trial. Marasigan now denies that Eco accompanied him to Daet, says he does not know why he was there, and does not remember that he (Eco) testified upon the hearing. And again, Marasigan stated that Eco secured the carabao in question in June 1911. Diego de Villa, who had the custody of the carabao, testified that it was delivered into his keeping by Marasigan in May, and was taken by Juan Eco under instructions from Marasigan in August 1911. The witness further stated that he was instructed by Marasigan to testify that the carabao was taken in June, though it was in fact taken in August. This is corroborated by Juan Eco, who states that in taking the carabao he was acting under the orders of Marasigan. The time of this taking is fixed by both witnesses as coincident with the fiesta of Bacabolani. Their testimony is corroborated by that of the accused and also by Marasigan's letter to this Court written August 7th, wherein he states that the accused is demanding of him P200. Had the carabao been delivered in June as testified to by Marasigan, the unpaid balance in August would have been P100. only.<br\/><br\/>The intervention of the defendant on behalf of Marasigan when the latter was prosecuted for falsification, is admitted. He went his bail when arrested and again when an appeal was taken. He was given a power of attorney to arrange for his defense before the Supreme Court, in which power of attorney Marasigan specifically recited his poverty and his inhability to pay attorney's fees. Eco took up with Contreras the matter of the defense of Marasigan, and undertook to be responsible to Contreras for his fees. Upon this point Contreras testified as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Mr. Eco was always speaking to me about this matter, and I spoke one time with Mr. Lukban in the Assembly committee, asking him about the case, and he replied that he had written to Marasigan.\"<\/blockquote>That Eco actually paid P200. to Contreras is shown by the direct and positive testimony of both Contreras and Eco. That Contreras regarded the accused as Marasigan's representative is conclusively shown by the fact that it was to Eco Contreras sent the telegram announcing Marasigan's acquittal. Eco did not know until December 1911 that Marasigan had not been defended in the Supreme Court by a regular attorney.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons and after a careful examination of this entire record we have encountered very little difficulty in reaching the conclusion that the prosecution failed to establish the guilt of the appellant. The judgment appealed from is therefore reversed, and the appellant is acquitted, with costs de oficio.<br\/><br\/>It is so ordered.<\/div>",

PAULINA, VALERIANA, LINO, AND RAYMUNDO GACO, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">Appeal through bill of exceptions by counsel for the plaintiff, from a judgment of July 29, 1912, whereby the Honorable P. M. Moir, judge, absolved the defendants from the complaint, with the costs against the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>On July 13, 1911, counsel for the plaintiff Marciana Moreno de Worrick filed a written complaint in the Court of First Instance of Ambos Camarines, alleging therein that she is the lawful owner of a tract of abaca land situated in the barrio of Cabanbanan, pueblo of San Vicente, Camarines, 129 hectares and 68 ares in area, the boundaries of which are given for the four cardinal points; that the defendants Paulina, Valeriana, Lino, and Raymundo, all surnamed Gaco, claimed to be the owners and possessors of a parcel of the said land, which has an approximate area of 10 <i>pisosones<\/i> and is bounded on the north, south, east, and west by the plaintiff's land; that the latter had suffered losses and damages to the extent of P200 through the annoyances occasioned her by the defendants' complaints and claims; wherefore the court was asked to render judgment by finding the plaintiff to be the exclusive lawful owner of the property described in the complaint and the sole person entitled to the possession and enjoyment thereof, by imposing perpetual silence upon all the defendants with respect to the ownership and possession of the said land, and by sentencing them to pay the sum\u00a0 of P200 as losses and damages, and the costs.<br\/><br\/>After confirming his exception entered to the order overruling the\u00a0 demurrer made to the complaint, counsel for defendants in reply denied each and all of the allegations contained therein, except that set out in the first paragraph thereof, which he admitted.\u00a0 In special defense, he alleged that the defendants had been for some time past the owners and proprietors of the\u00a0 land\u00a0 claimed by them and were in quiet and peaceable possession of it up to January 1, 1911, when the plaintiff unlawfully entered into possession of it; for they\u00a0 had acquired ownership thereof by inheritance from the [father] of the defendant Paulina and grandfather of the other defendants, the deceased Juan Gaco, their predecessor in interest, who had held the land until the said month of January; and that at his death the defendants had remained in quiet and peaceable possession of it; wherefore the defendants had through a possession of more than forty years acquired ownership and control by prescription also; and, further, the plaintiff's right to claim the property in question, on the supposition that she may have had such, had prescribed.<br\/><br\/>As a counterclaim, he alleged that the plaintiff did, on or about January 1, 1911, without the knowledge or consent of the defendants, the owners of the land claimed by them for some time past, appropriate and take possession thereof and refuse to return it to the defendants; that the plaintiff, by such unlawful act of\u00a0 dispossession and by having ordered the stripping of the abaca plants on the said land for her own profit, caused the defendants losses and damages to the extent of P500.\u00a0 He therefore petitioned that they be absolved from the complaint, and that the plaintiff be sentenced to return to them the land in question, to hold their peace forever, to pay P500 to the defendants as losses and damages, and to pay the costs of the\u00a0 suit.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the plaintiff, in his reply of June 25, 1912, denied each and all of the allegations contained in the defendants' counterclaim and prayed that judgment be rendered in his client's behalf and against the defendants, in conformity with the petition in his complaint.<br\/><br\/>After hearing of the case and introduction of evidence by the parties, the documents exhibited being attached to the record, the court rendered the judgment aforementioned, to which counsel for the plaintiff entered an exception and asked for a new trial.\u00a0 This motion was overruled, and exception taken thereto by the appellant.\u00a0 The proper bill of exceptions was filed, approved, and transmitted to the clerk of this court.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff has brought against the defendants an action for recovery of possession, for the purpose of obtaining from the courts an express finding that she is the owner of the parcel of land which the defendants claim to hold under title of ownership.<br\/><br\/>This parcel or portion of land of some <i>10 pisosones<\/i> in area, equivalent approximately to three hectares, is entirely embraced within and bounded on all its sides by the large tract of land which belongs to the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>Aside from the oral evidence by which an attempt was made to show that\u00a0 the defendants enjoyed\u00a0 possession of the land in question,\u00a0 the document marked A was exhibited for the purpose of proving the ownership held in the said land by Juan Gaco, alleged to be the defendants' predecessor in interest.<br\/><br\/>This Exhibit A is a copy of an original document found among the protocols of the public instrument filed in the archives of the old <i>alcaldia mayor<\/i> of the Province of Camarines Norte and was issued on September 14, 1870, by the <i>alcalde<\/i> and signed by two witnesses.<br\/><br\/>In the information contained in the document above mentioned are the statements of three witnesses who asserted that to their knowledge Juan Gaco brought under original cultivation the land situated in Cabanbanan, planted it to abaca and had been in possession of the property for a period of twenty to thirty years.\u00a0 The said document also shows a general sketch of\u00a0 the land, with statement of its boundaries for the four cardinal points.\u00a0 By a decree of September 14,1870, that information initiated by Juan Gaco relative to the possession of the said land was approved in so far as it was in accord with the law and with the proviso of not being to the prejudice of third parties.<br\/><br\/>As against this document and the other evidence adduced by the defendants, the plaintiff presented a composition title for 129 hectares and 68 ares of land, situated in the said barrio of Cabanbanan, <i>sitio<\/i> of Nueva Segovia, issued to Estanislao Moreno by the <i>Direccion General de Administracion Civil<\/i>, on January 10, 1887.\u00a0 A memorandum of this title was made in the records of the government of that province and in those of the <i>Inspeccion General de Montes<\/i> and the instrument itself was entered in the property registry on September 18, 1890.<br\/><br\/>Upon the death of Estanislao Moreno the property passed by inheritance to Udefonso Moreno y Ramirez, and, on account of the latter having died intestate, in proceeding with the division of his estate among his declared heirs, the land before\u00a0 mentioned, together with some other property, was allotted to his sister Marciana Moreno.\u00a0 This division of the estate was approved by the Court of First Instance, and Marciana Moreno's hereditary title\u00a0 to the said land, originally acquired by her first predecessor in interest through \"composition\" with the state, was inscribed in the registry.<br\/><br\/>From the testimony brought out by the plaintiff, it was shown that none of the defendants was in possession of the parcel of land in litigation, and that they resided and had their houses on adjacent land belonging to Felix Moreno, whose laborers they were, it being customary in that province for the tenants or laborers of the owner of the land to build their houses and live on the land where they work and where grows the abaca they are required to\u00a0 cultivate and strip.\u00a0 However, it is concluded from the whole of the evidence submitted by both parties, that the defendants did in fact occupy the land in question, comprised within, and situated almost in the center of the large tract belonging to the plaintiff, as the laborers, if not of the plaintiff, of her predecessors in interest, with the knowledge and tolerance of such owners.<br\/><br\/>The document exhibited by the defendants does not constitute proof that the land to which it refers was undoubtedly the land now in litigation.<br\/><br\/>The record does not show that when the state awarded a \"composition\" title to Estanislao Moreno, the plaintiff's predecessor in interest, for the large tract of land of 129 hectares and 68 ares, the grant was made subject to the exclusion of the land of which the defendants claim to' be the owners as having inherited it from their alleged predecessor in interest, Juan Gaco, for it does not so appear in the \"composition\" title, and in recording the boundaries of the 129 hectares and 68 ares no express exclusion was made of the land in question as not being comprised within that title.<br\/><br\/>Article 444 of the Civil Code prescribes:\u00a0 \"Acts which are merely tolerated and those clandestinely executed, without knowledge of the possessor of the thing, or by force, do not affect the possession.\"<br\/><br\/>Article 1942 of the same code also provides:\u00a0 \"Acts of a possessory character, performed by virtue of a license, or by mere tolerance on the part of the owner, are of no effect for establishing possession.\"<br\/><br\/>Even supposing that Juan Gaco, the defendants' predecessor in interest, actually occupied the parcel of land in litigation, yet,\u00a0 once the state had, after fulfillment of the procedure established by administrative laws, awarded the entire tract of land described in the \"composition\" title, without exception or exclusion whatever of any part thereof as private property, it is to be presumed that all the land so granted to Ildefonso Moreno under title of \"composition\" belonged to the State, and that Juan Gaco occupied the disputed parcel of land by mere tolerance and without any title whatever, for his heirs have not proved that their said predecessor in interest was the lawful owner of the property, or that he acquired it in accordance with law.<br\/><br\/>Upon the institution and termination of administrative proceedings for the award by the state of a \"composition\" title to a tract of land that had not become private property, it is presumed that all the formalities prescribed by law were fulfilled and that the land concerned was in fact new and unappropriated ground; and when once title issued to the grantee, he became the sole owner and proprietor of the land so granted and awarded by the state through \"composition,\" since the Government, in granting the ownership title in such land, did so on the assumption that it was unappropriated and not legally in the possession of any one, for the reason that, in response to the notices and edicts published, no one protested or presented any claim whatever against the \"composition\" sought of a part or portion of the land concerned in the aforesaid possessory proceedings.<br\/><br\/>The land obtained by Ildefonso Moreno during his lifetime comes within the case described in the preceding paragraph, since it is not disclosed by the record that, upon the institution of the proper proceedings for award of title, either Juan Gaco or any of his descendents protested or presented any claim against the application for \"composition,\" submitted by the grantee.\u00a0 Upon the issuance of the title referred to, memorandum made thereof in the records of the government of the province and its inscription in the property registry, the grantee Moreno became the sole lawful owner of the entire 129 hectares and 68 ares of land specified in the title, and without the exclusion of the parcel claimed by the defendants, for they did not duly prove that they were the owners, and before them their predecessor in interest, Juan Gaco, of the parcel of land in question, prior to the proceedings for obtaining the \"composition\" title.<br\/><br\/>In the decision in the case of Balatian <i>vs<\/i>. Agra (17 Phil. Rep., 501), the following legal principle was laid down:\u00a0 \"A title by composition with the state is a title of exclusive ownership\u00a0 in favor of the party who appears therein as grantee.\u00a0 It excludes all other claimants and no adverse claim can be recognized unless such claim is clearly proven.\"<br\/><br\/>In the case of Dancel and Mina <i>vs<\/i>. Ventura (24 Phil. Rep., 421), it was held: \"The concessionary of an unappropriated tract of land who has obtained a composition title thereto, issued by and in the name of the Government and duly registerd, is the sole owner of the property appearing in his name in the property registry, until his title be annulled or cancelled by a final judgment of the courts.\"<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 defendants have not proved that they are the lawful owners of the parcel of land in dispute, and even if the possessory information, Exhibit A, were admissible as proof of their possession, yet, as it was given\u00a0 under the proviso of not being in prejudice of third parties with a better right, once the plaintiff has proven her better right to the whole of the land comprised within the said title, without exclusion of any definite portion thereof in the defendants' favor, the plaintiff has an incontrovertible right of ownership in the entire property and, likewise, in the land in litigation.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the claim for losses and damages, it must be borne in mind that there is no evidence of record to show that the defendants acted in bad faith in usurping the property.\u00a0 By reason of the document they held, they probably believed they had a right to it.\u00a0 Therefore, as it must be held that they acted in good faith, so long as there is no proof to the contrary, it would not be right to oblige them to pay the indemnity demanded.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, we hereby reverse the judgment appealed\u00a0 from and hold that Marciana Moreno de Worrick is the lawful owner of the aforesaid parcel of land, with respect to which we enjoin upon the defendants perpetual silence.\u00a0 No special finding is made as to costs,<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Johnson<\/i> and <i>Moreland, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><i>Carson, J<\/i>., dissents.<\/div>",

(2) Pedro Sablan had acquired them from his ascendant Victoriano Sablan, likewise by inheritance; (3) Victoriano Sablan had likewise acquired them by inheritance from his ascendants, Mariano Sablan and Maria Rita Fernandez, they having been adjudicated to him in the partition of hereditary property had between him and his brothers.\u00a0 These are admitted facts.<br\/><br\/>A very definite conclusion of law is that the hereditary title is one without a valuable consideration [gratuitous title], and it is so characterized in article 968 of the Civil Code, for he who acquires by inheritance gives nothing in return for what he receives; and a very definite conclusion of law also is that the uncles german are within the third degree of blood relationship.<br\/><blockquote>\"The ascendant who inherits from his descendant property which the latter acquired without a valuable consideration from another ascendant, or from a brother or sister, is under obligation to reserve what he has acquired by operation of law for the relatives who are within the third degree and belong to the line whence the property proceeded.\"\u00a0 (Civil Code, art. 811.)<br\/><\/blockquote>Marcelina Edroso, ascendant of Pedro Sablan, inherited from him these two parcels of land which he had acquired without a valuable\u00a0 consideration\u2014that is, by inheritance from another ascendant, his father Victoriano.\u00a0 Having acquired them by operation of law, she is obligated to reserve them intact for the claimants, who are uncles or relatives within the third degree and belong to the line of Mariano Sablan and Maria Rita Fernandez, whence the lands proceeded.\u00a0 The trial court's ruling that\u00a0 they partake\u00a0 of the nature of property required by law to be reserved is therefore in accordance with the law.<br\/><br\/>But the appellant contends that it is not proven that the two parcels\u00a0 of land in question have been acquired by operation of law, and that only property acquired without a valuable consideration, which is by operation of law, is required by law to be reserved.<br\/><br\/>The appellees justly argue that this defense ,was not alleged or discussed in first instance, but only herein.\u00a0 Certainly, the\u00a0 allegation in\u00a0 first instance was merely that \"Pedro Sablan acquired the property in question in 1882, before the enforcement of the Civil Code, which establishes the alleged right required by law to be reserved, of which the opponents speak; hence, prescription of the right of action; and, finally, opponents' renunciation of their right, admitting that it existed and that they had it\" (p. 49).<br\/><br\/>However that be, it is not superfluous to say, although it may be unnecessary, that the applicant inherited the two parcels of land from her son Pedro, who died \"unmarried and without issue.\"\u00a0 The trial court so held as a conclusion of fact, without any objection on the appellant's part.\u00a0 (B. of E., 17, 20.)\u00a0 When Pedro Sablan died without issue, his mother became his heir by virtue of her right to her son's legal portion under article 935 of the Civil Code:<br\/><blockquote>\"In the absence of legitimate children\u00a0 and descendants of the deceased, his ascendants shall inherit from him, to the exclusion of collateral's.\"<\/blockquote>The contrary could only have occurred if the heiress had demonstrated that any of these lands had passed into her possession by free disposal in her son's will; but the case presents no testamentary provision that demonstrates any transfer of property from the son to the mother, not by operation of law, but by her son's wish.\u00a0 The legal presumption is that the transfer of the two parcels of land was abintestate or by operation of law, and not by will or the wish of the predecessor in interest (Act No. 190, sec. 334, No. 26.) All the provisions of article 811 of the Civil Code have therefore been fully complied with.<br\/><br\/>If Pedro Sablan had instituted his mother in a will as the universal heiress of his property, all he left at death would not be required by law to be reserved, but only what he would have perforce left her as the legal portion of a legitimate ascendant.<br\/><blockquote>\"The legal portion of the parents or ascendants is constituted by one-half of the hereditary estate of the children and descendants.\u00a0 The latter may unrestrictedly dispose\u00a0 of the other half, with the exception of what is established in article 836.\"\u00a0 (Civil Code, art. 809.) <\/blockquote> In such case only the half constituting the legal portion would be required by law to be\u00a0 reserved, because it is what by operation of law would fall to the mother from her son's inheritance; the other half at free disposal would not have to be reserved.\u00a0 This is all that article 811 of the Civil Code says:<br\/><br\/>No error has been incurred in holding that the two parcels of land which are the subject matter of the application are required by law to be reserved, because the interested party has not proved that either of them became her inheritance through the free disposal of her son.<br\/><br\/>Proof of testate succession devolves upon the heir or heiress who alleges it.\u00a0 It must be admitted that a half of Pedro Sablan's inheritance was acquired by his mother by operation of law.\u00a0 The law provides that the other half is also presumed to be acquired by operation of law\u2014that is, by intestate succession.\u00a0 Otherwise, proof to offset this presumption must be presented by the interested party, that is, that the other half was acquired by the man's wish and not by operation of law.<br\/><br\/>Nor is the third assignment of error admissible-that' the trial court failed to sustain the renunciation of the right required by law to be reserved, which the applicant attributes to the opponents.\u00a0 Such renunciation does not appear in the case.\u00a0 The appellant deduces it from the fact that the appellees did not contradict the following statement of hers at the trial:<br\/><blockquote>\"The day after<i> my brother-in-law Pablo Sablan<\/i> died and was buried, his brother came to my house and said that those rice lands were mine, because we had already talked about making delivery of them\" (p. 91).<\/blockquote>The other brother alluded to is Basilio Sablan, as stated on page 92.\u00a0 From the fact that Basilio Sablan said that the lands belong to the appellant and must be delivered to her it cannot be deduced that he renounced the right required by law to be reserved in such lands by virtue of the provisions of article 811 of the Civil Code, for they really belong to her and must be delivered to her.<br\/><br\/>The fourth assignment of error sets up the defense of prescription of the right of action.\u00a0 The appellant alleges prescription of the opponents' right of action for requiring fulfillment of the obligation they attribute to her recording in the property registry the right required by law to be reserved, in accordance with the provisions of the Mortgage Law; and as such obligation is created by law, it prescribes in the time fixed in No. 2 of section 43 of Act No. 190.\u00a0 She adds: \"Prescription of the <i>right<\/i> alleged to be reserved by force of law has not been invoked.\"\u00a0 (Eighth allegation.)<br\/><br\/>The appellant does not state in her brief what those provisions of the Mortgage Law are.\u00a0 Nor did she do so in first instance, where she says only the following, which is quoted from the record: \"I do\u00a0 not refer to the prescription of the right required by law to be reserved in the\u00a0 property; I refer to the prescription\u00a0 of the\u00a0 right of action of those who are entitled to the <i>guaranty<\/i> of that right for seeking that guaranty, for to those who are entitled to that right the Mortgage Law grants a period of time for recording it in the property registry, if I remember correctly, ninety days, for seeking entry in the registry, but as they have not exercised that right of action, such right of action for seeking here that it be recorded has prescribed.\u00a0 <i>The right of action for requiring that the property be reserved <\/i>has not prescribed, but the right of action for guaranteeing in the property registry that this property is required by law to be reserved\" (p. 69 of the record).<br\/><br\/>The appellees reply:\u00a0 It is true that their right of action has prescribed for requiring the applicant to constitute the mortgage imposed by the Mortgage Law for guaranteeing the effectiveness of the right required by law to be reserved;\u00a0 but because that right of action has prescribed, that property has not been divested of its character of property required by law to be reserved; that it has such character by virtue of article 811 of the Civil Code, which went into effect in the Philippines in December, 1889 and not by virtue of the Mortgage Law, which only went into effect in the country by law of July 14,1893; that from December, 1889, to July, 1893, property which under article 811 of the Civil Code acquired the character of property reserved by operation of law was such independently of the Mortgage Law, which did not yet form part of the positive legislation of the country;\u00a0 that although the Mortgage Law has been in effect in the country since July, 1893, still it has in no way altered the force of article 811 of the Civil Code, but has operated to reinforce the same merely by granting the right of action to the persons in whose favor the right is reserved by operation of law to require of the\u00a0 person holding the property a guaranty in the form of a mortgage to answer for the enforcement, in due time, of the right; that to lose the right of action to the guaranty is not to lose the right itself; that the right reserved is the principal obligation and the mortgage the accessory obligation, and loss of the accessory does not mean loss of the principal.\u00a0 (Fifth and sixth allegations.)<br\/><br\/>The existence of the right required by law to be reserved in the two parcels of land in question being indisputable, even though it be admitted that the right of action which the Mortgage Law grants as a guaranty of final enforcement of such right has prescribed, the only thing to be determined in this appeal is the question\u00a0 raised in the first assignment of error, that is, how said two parcels of land can and ought to be registered, not in the property registry established by the Mortgage Law, but in the registry newly organized by Act No. 496.\u00a0 But as there have slipped into the allegations quoted some rather inexact ideas that further obscure such an intricate subject as this of the rights required to be reserved in Spanish-Philippine law, a brief digression on the most essential points may not be out of place here.<br\/><br\/>The Mortgage Law of July 14,1893, to which the appellees allude,\u00a0 is the amended\u00a0 one of\u00a0 the colonies, not the\u00a0 first enforced in the colonies and consequently in the Philippines.\u00a0 The preamble of said amended Mortgage Law states:<br\/><blockquote>\"The Mortgage Law in force in Spain for thirty years went into effect, with the modifications necessary for its adaptation, in the Antilles on May 1, 1880, and in the Philippines on December 1, 1889, thus commencing in those regions the renovation of the law on real property, and consequently of agrarian credit.\"<\/blockquote>The Civil Code went into effect in the Philippines in the same year, 1889, but on the eighth day.<br\/><br\/>Two kinds of property\u00a0 required by law to be reserved are distinguished in the Civil Code, as set forth in article 968 thereof, where it says:<br\/><blockquote>\"Besides the reservation imposed by article<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> 811<\/span>, the widow or widower contracting a second marriage shall be obliged to set apart\u00a0 for the children and descendants of the first marriage the ownership of all the property he or she may have acquired from the deceased spouse by will, by intestate succession, by gift, or other transfer without a valuable consideration.\"<\/blockquote>The Mortgage Law of Spain and the first law that went into effect\u00a0 in the Philippines on\u00a0 December 1, 1889, do not contain any provision that can be applied to the right reserved by article 811\u00a0 of the Civil Code, for such right is a creation of the Civil Code.\u00a0 In those laws appear merely the provisions intended to guarantee the effectiveness of the right in favor of the children of the first marriage when their father or mother contracts a second marriage.\u00a0 Nevertheless, the holding of the supreme court of Spain, for the first time set forth in the decision on appeal of November 8, 1894, has been reiterated:<br\/><blockquote>\"That while the provisions of articles 977 and 978 of the Civil Code that tend to secure the right required to be reserved in the property refer especially to the spouses who contract second or later marriages, they do not thereby cease to be applicable to the right established in article 811, because, aside from the legal reason, which is the same in both cases, such must be the construction from the important and conclusive circumstance that said provisions are set forth in the chapter that deals with inheritances in common, either testate\u00a0 or intestate, and because article 968, which heads the section that deals in general with property required by law to be\u00a0 reserved, makes reference to the provisions\u00a0 in article 811; and it would consequently be contradictory to the principle of the law and of the common nature\u00a0 of said provisions not to hold them applicable to that right.\"<\/blockquote>Thus it was again stated in a decision on appeal, December 30, 1897, that:\u00a0 \"As the supreme court has already declared, the guaranties that the Code fixes in articles 977 and 978 for the rights required by law to be reserved to which said articles refer, are applicable to the special right dealt with in article 811, because the same principle exists and because of the general\u00a0 nature of the provisions of the chapter in which they are found.\"<br\/><br\/>From this principle of jurisprudence it is inferred that if from December, 1889, to July, 1893, a case had occurred of a right required to be reserved by article 811, the persons entitled to such right would have been able to institute, against the ascendant who must make the reservation, proceedings for the assurance and guaranty that articles 977 and 978 grant to the children of a first marriage against their father or mother who has married again.\u00a0 The proceedings for assurance, under article 977, are:\u00a0 Inventory of the property subject to the right reserved, annotation in the property registry of such right reserved in the real property and appraisal of the personal property;\u00a0 and the guaranty, under article 978, is the assurance by mortgage, in the case of realty, of the value of what is validly alienated.<br\/><br\/>But since the amended Mortgage\u00a0 Law went into effect by law of July 14, 1893, in the Philippines this is not only a principle of jurisprudence which may be invoked for the applicability to the right reserved in article 811 of the remedies of assurance and guaranty provided for the right reserved in article 968, but there\u00a0 is a positive provision of said law, which is an advantage over the law of Spain, to wit, article 199, which read thus:<br\/><blockquote>\"The special mortgage for\u00a0 guaranteeing the right reserved by article 811 of the Civil Code can only be required by the relatives in whose favor the property is to be reserved, if they are of age; if minors, it will be required by the persons who should legally represent them.\u00a0 In either case the right of the persons in whose favor the property must be reserved will be secured by the same requisites as set forth in the preceding\u00a0 articles (relative to the right reserved by article 968 of the Civil Code), applying to the person <i>obligated<\/i> to reserve the right the provisions with respect to the <i>father<\/i>.\"<\/blockquote>In article 168 of the same law the new subsection 2 is added in connection with article 199 quoted, so that said article 168 reads thus:<br\/><blockquote>\"Legal mortgage is established:<br\/><br\/>\"1.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>\"2. In favor of the relatives to whom article 811 of the Civil Code refers, for the property required to be reserved, upon the property of the person obligated to reserve it.\"<\/blockquote>This being admitted, and admitted also that both the litigating parties agree that the period of ninety days fixed for the right of action to the guaranty, that is, to require the mortgage that guarantees the effectiveness of the right required by law to be reserved, has prescribed, it is necessary to lay down a principle in this\u00a0 matter.\u00a0 Now it should be noted that such action has not prescribed, because the period of ninety days fixed by the Mortgage Law is not for the exercise of the right of action of the persons entitled to the right reserved, but for the fulfillment of the obligation of the person who must make the reservation.<br\/><br\/>Article 191 of the law reads thus:\u00a0 \"If ninety days pass without the father's instituting in court the proceeding to which the foregoing article refers, the relatives themselves may demand fulfillment, etc.,\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 applying, according to said article 199, to the person obligated to reserve the right the provisions with respect to the father.\"<br\/><br\/>Article 203 of the regulation for the application of the Mortgage Law says: \"In the case of article 199 of the law the proceedings to which article 190 thereof refers will be instituted within the ninety days succeeding the date of the date of the acceptation of the inheritance by the person obligated to reserve the property;\u00a0 <i>after this period has elapsed<\/i>, the interested parties may require the institution of such proceedings, if they are of age; and in any other case, their legal representatives.\"<br\/><br\/>Thus it clearly appears that the lapse of the ninety days is not the expiration by prescription of the period for the exercise of this right of action by the persons in whose favor the right must be reserved, but really the commencement thereof, and enables them to exercise it at any time, since no limit is set in the law.\u00a0 So, if the annotation of the right required by law to be reserved in the two parcels of land in question must be made in the property registry of the Mortgage Law, the persons entitled to it may now institute proceedings to that end, and an allegation of prescription against the exercise of such right of action cannot be sustained.<br\/><br\/>Since the applicant confesses that she does not allege prescription of the right of action <i>for requiring that the property be reserved<\/i>, for she explicitly so stated at the trial, and as the case presents no necessity for the proceedings that should be instituted in accordance with the provisions of the Mortgage Law, this prescription of the right of action cannot take place, because such right of action does not exist with reference to instituting proceedings for annotation in the registry of Act No. 496 of the right to the property required by law to be reserved.\u00a0 It is sufficient, as was done in the present case, to intervene in the registration proceedings with the claim set up by the two opponents for recording therein the right reserved in either parcel of land.<br\/><br\/>Now comes the main point in the appeal.\u00a0 The trial court denied the registration because of this finding set forth in its decision:<br\/><blockquote>\"Absolute title to the two parcels of land undoubtedly belongs to the\u00a0 applicant and the two uncles of the deceased Pedro Sablan, and the application cannot be made except in the name of all of them in common.\"\u00a0 (B. of E., p. 20.)<\/blockquote>It must be remembered that absolute title consists of the rights\u00a0 to use, enjoy, dispose of,, and recover.\u00a0 The person who has in himself all these rights has the absolute or complete ownership of the thing; otherwise, the person who has the rights to use and enjoy will have the usufruct, and the person who has the rights of disposal and recovery the direct title.\u00a0 The person who by law, act, or contract is granted the fright of usufruct has the first two rights of using and enjoying, and then he is said not to have the fee simple\u2014that is, the rights of disposal and recovery, which pertain to another who, after the usufruct expires, will come into full ownership.<br\/><br\/>The question set up in the first assignment of error of the appellant's brief is this:<br\/><blockquote><i>\"What are the rights in the property of the person who holds it subject to the reservation of article 811 of the Civil Code?\" <\/i><\/blockquote>There are not lacking writers who say, only those of a usufructuary, the ultimate title belonging to the persons in whose favor the reservation is made.\u00a0 If that were so, the person holding the property could not apply for registration of title, but the person in whose favor it must be reserved, with the former's consent.\u00a0 This opinion does not seem to be admissible, although it appears to be supported by decisions of the supreme court of Spain of May 21, 1861, and June 18, 1880, prior to the Civil Code, and of June 22, 1895, somewhat subsequent to the enforcement thereof.<br\/><br\/>Another writer says:\u00a0 \"This opinion only looks at two salient points\u2014the usufruct and the fee simple; the remaining features of the arrangement are not perceived, but become obscured in the presence of that deceptive emphasis which only brings out two things: that the person holding the property will enjoy it and that he must keep what he enjoys for other persons.\"\u00a0 (Manresa, VII, 189.)<br\/><br\/>In another place he says:\u00a0 \"We do not believe that the third opinion can now be maintained-that is, that the surviving spouse (the person obligated by article 968 to make the reservation) can\u00a0 be regarded as a mere usufructuary and the descendants immediately as the owner; such theory has no serious foundation in the Code.\"\u00a0 (Ibid., 238.)<br\/><br\/>The ascendant who inherits from a descendant, whether by the latter's wish or by operation of law, acquires the inheritance by virtue of a title perfectly transferring absolute ownership.\u00a0 All the attributes of the right of ownership belong to him exclusively\u2014use, enjoyment, disposal and recovery.\u00a0 This absolute ownership, which is inherent in the hereditary title, is not altered in the least, if there be no relatives within the third degree in the line whence the property proceeds or they die before the ascendant heir who is the possessor and absolute owner of the property.\u00a0 If there should be relatives within the third degree who belong to the line whence the property proceeded, then a limitation to that absolute ownership would arise.\u00a0 The nature and scope of this limitation must be determined with exactness in order not to vitiate rights that the law wishes to be effective.\u00a0 The opinion which makes this limitation consist in reducing the ascendant heir to the condition of a mere usufructuary, depriving him of the right of disposal and recovery, does not seem to have any support in the law, as it does not have, according to the opinion that has been expressed in speaking of the rights of the father or mother who has married again.\u00a0 There is a marked difference between the case where a man's wish institutes two persons as his heirs, one as usufructuary and the other as owner of his property, and the case of the ascendant in article 811 or of the father or mother in article 968.\u00a0 In the first case, there is not the slightest doubt that the title to the hereditary property resides in the hereditary owner and only he can dispose of and recover it, while the usufructuary can in no way perform any act of disposal of the hereditary property (except that he may dispose of the right of usufruct in accordance with the provisions of article 480 of the Civil Code), or any act of recovery thereof except the limited one in the form prescribed in article 486 of the Code itself, because he totally lacks\u00a0 the fee simple.\u00a0 But the ascendant who holds the property required by article 811 to be\u00a0 reserved, and the father or mother required by article 968 to reserve the right, can dispose of the property they inherit itself, the former from his descendant and the latter from his or her child in first marriage, and recover it from anyone who may unjustly detain it, while the persons in whose favor the right is required to be reserved in either case cannot perform any act whatsoever of disposal or of recovery.<br\/><br\/>Article 975 states explicitly that the father or mother required by article 968 to reserve the right may dispose of the property itself:<br\/><blockquote>\"Alienation of the property required by law to be reserved which may be made by the surviving spouse <i>after<\/i> contracting a second marriage shall be valid\u00a0 only if at his or her death no legitimate children or descendants of the first marriage survive, without prejudice to the provisions of the Mortgage Law.\"<br\/><br\/>It thus appears that the alienation is valid, although not altogether effective, but under a condition subsequent, to wit:\u00a0 \"If at his or her death no legitimate children or descendants of the first marriage survive.\"<\/blockquote>If the title did not reside in the person holding the property to be reserved, his alienation thereof would necessarily be null and void, as executed without a right to do so and without a right which he could transmit to the acquirer.\u00a0 The law says that the alienation subsists (to subsist is to continue to exist) \"without prejudice to the provisions of the Mortgage Law.\"\u00a0 Article 109 of this Law says:<br\/><blockquote>\"The possessor of property subject to conditions subsequent <i>that are still pending<\/i> may mortgage or alienate it, provided always that he preserve the right of the parties interested in said conditions by expressly reserving that right in the registration.\"<\/blockquote>In such case, the child or legitimate descendant of the first marriage in whose favor the right is reserved cannot impugn the validity of the alienation so long as the condition subsequent is pending, that is, so long as the remarried spouse who must reserve the right is alive, because it might easily happen that the person who must reserve the right should outlive all the persons in whose favor the right is reserved and then there would be no reason for the condition subsequent that they survive him, and, the object of the law having disappeared, the right required to be reserved would disappear, and the alienation would not only be valid but also in every way absolutely effective.\u00a0 Consequently, the alienation is valid when the right required by law to be reserved to the children is respected; while the effects of the alienation depend upon a condition, because it will or will not become definite, it will continue to exist or cease to exist, according to circumstances.\u00a0 This is what the law establishes with reference to the reservation of article 968, wherein the legislator expressly directs that the surviving spouse who contracts a second marriage shall reserve to the children or descendants of the first marriage <i>ownership<\/i>.\u00a0 Article 811 says nothing more than that the ascendant must <i>make the reservation.<\/i><br\/><br\/>Manresa, with his recognized ability, summarizes the subject under the heading, \"<i>Rights<\/i> and obligations during the existence of the right required by law to be reserved,\" in these words:<br\/><blockquote>\"During the whole period between the constitution in legal form of the right required by law to be reserved and the extinction thereof, the relatives within the third degree, after the right that <i>in their turn<\/i> may pertain to them has been <i>assured<\/i>, have only an expectation, and therefore they do not even have the capacity to transmit that expectation to their heirs.<br\/><br\/>\"The ascendant is in the first place a usufructuary who should use and enjoy the things according to their nature, in the manner and form already set forth in commenting upon the articles of the Code referring to use and usufruct.<br\/><br\/>\"But since in addition to being the usufructuary he is, even though conditionally, the owner in fee simple of the property, he can dispose of it in the manner provided in articles 974 and 976 of the same Code.\u00a0 Doubt arose also on this point, but the <i>Direccion General<\/i> of the registries, in an opinion of June 25, 1892, declared that articles 974 and 975, which are applicable by analogy, for they refer to property reserved by law, reveal in the clearest manner the attitude of the legislator on this subject, and the relatives within the third degree ought not to be more privileged in the right reserved in article 811 than the children in the right reserved by article 975, chiefly for the reason that the right required to be reserved carries with it a condition subsequent, and the property subject to those conditions can validly\u00a0 be alienated in accordance with article 109 of the Mortgage Law, such alienation to continue, pending fulfillment of the condition.\"\u00a0 (Civil Code, VI, 270.)<\/blockquote>Another commentator corroborates the foregoing in every way:\u00a0 He says:<br\/><blockquote>\"The ascendant acquires that property with a condition subsequent, to wit, whether or not there exist at the time of his death relatives within the third degree of the descendant from whom they inherit in the line whence the property proceeds.\u00a0 If such relatives exist, they acquire ownership of the property at the death of the ascendant.\u00a0 If they do not exist, the ascendant can freely dispose thereof.\u00a0 If this is true, since the possessor of property subject to conditions subsequent can alienate and encumber it, the ascendant may alienate the property required by law to be reserved, but he will alienate what he has and nothing more because no one can give what does not belong to him, and the acquirer will therefore receive <i>a limited and revocable title<\/i>.\u00a0 The relatives within the third degree will in their turn have an expectation to the property while the ascendant lives, an expectation that cannot be transmitted to their heirs, unless these are also within the third degree.\u00a0 After the person who is required by law to reserve the right has died, the relatives may rescind the alienation of the realty required by law to be reserved and they will acquire it and all the rest that has the same character in complete ownership, <i>in fee simple<\/i>, because the condition and the usufruct have been terminated by the death of the usufructuary.\"\u00a0 (Morell, <i>Estudios sobre bienes reservables<\/i>, 304, 305.)<\/blockquote>The conclusion is that the person required by article 811 to reserve the right has, beyond any doubt at all, the rights of use and usufruct.\u00a0 He has, moreover, for the reasons set forth, the legal title and dominion, although under a condition subsequent.\u00a0\u00a0 Clearly he has, under an express provision of the law, the right to dispose of the property reserved, and to dispose of is to alienate, although under a condition.\u00a0 He has the right to recover it, because he is the one who possesses or should possess it and have title to it, although a limited and revocable one.\u00a0 In a word, the legal title and dominion, even though under a condition,\u00a0 reside in him while he lives.\u00a0 After the right required by law to be reserved has been assured, he can do anything that a genuine owner can do.<br\/><br\/>On the other hand, the relatives within the third degree in whose favor the right is reserved cannot dispose of the property, first because it is in no way, either actually, constructively or formally, in their possession; and, moreover, because they have no title of ownership or of fee simple which they can transmit to another, on the hypothesis that only when the person who must; reserve the right should die before them will they acquire it, thus creating a fee simple, and only then will they take their place in the succession of the descendant of whom they are relatives within the third degree, that is to say, a second contingent place in said legitimate succession in the fashion of aspirants to a possible future legacy.\u00a0 If any of the persons in whose favor the right is reserved should, after their right has been assured in the registry, dare to dispose of even nothing more than the fee simple of the property to be reserved his act would be null and void, for, as was\u00a0 definitely decided in the decision on appeal of December 30, 1897, it is impossible to determine the part \"that might pertain therein to the relative at the time he exercised the right, because in view of the nature and scope of the right required by law to be reserved the extent of his right cannot be foreseen, for it may disappear by his dying before the person required to reserve it, just as it may even become absolute should that person die.\"<br\/><br\/>Careful consideration of the matter forces the conclusion that no act of disposal <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">inter vivos<\/span> of the person required by law to reserve the right can be impugned by him in whose favor it is reserved, because such person has all, absolutely all, the rights inherent in ownership, except that the legal title is burdened with a condition that the third party acquirer may ascertain from the registry in order to know that he is acquiring a title subject to a condition subsequent.\u00a0 In conclusion, it seems to us that only an act of disposal <i>mortis causa<\/i> in favor of persons other than relatives within the third degree of the descendant from whom he got the property to be reserved must be prohibited to him, because this alone has been the object of the law:\u00a0 \"To prevent persons outside a family from securing, by some special accident of life, property that would otherwise have remained therein.\"\u00a0 (Decision of December 30, 1897.)<br\/><br\/>Practically, even in the opinion of those who reduce the person reserving the right to the condition of a mere usufructuary, the person in\u00a0 whose\u00a0 favor it must be reserved cannot attack the alienation that may be absolutely made of the property the law requires to be reserved, in the present case, that which the applicant has made of the two parcels of land in\u00a0 question to a third party, because the conditional alienation that is permitted her is equivalent\u00a0 to an alienation of the usufruct, which is authorized by article 480 of the Civil Code, and, practically, use and enjoyment of the property required by law to be reserved are all that the person who must reserve it has during his lifetime, and in alienating the usufruct all the\u00a0 usefulness of the thing would be transmitted in an incontrovertible manner.\u00a0 The question as to whether or not she transmits the fee simple is purely academic, <i>sine re<\/i>, for it is not real, actual and positive, as is the case of the institution of two heirs, one a usufructuary and the other the owner, by the express, wish of the predecessor in interest.<br\/><br\/>If the person whom article 811 requires to reserve the right has all the rights inherent in ownership, he can use, enjoy, dispose\u00a0 of and recover it; and if, in addition to usufructuary, he is in fact and in law the real owner and can alienate it, although under a condition, the whole question is reduced to the following terms:<br\/><br\/>Cannot the heir of the property required by law to be reserved, merely because a condition subsequent is annexed to his right of disposal, himself alone register the ownership of the property he has inherited, when the persons in whose favor the reservation must be made agree thereto, provided that the right reserved to them in the two parcels of land be recorded, as the law provides?<br\/><br\/>It is well known that the vendee under <i>pacto de retracto<\/i> acquires all the rights of the vendor:<br\/><blockquote>\"The vendee substitutes the vendor in all his rights and actions.\"\u00a0 (Civil Code, art. 1511.)<\/blockquote>If the vendor can register his title, the vendee can also register this same title after he has once acquired it.\u00a0 This title, however, in its\u00a0 attribute of being disposable, has a condition subsequent annexed-that the alienation the purchaser may make will be terminated, if the vendor should exercise the right granted him by article 1507, which says,:<br\/><br\/>\"Conventional redemption shall take place when the vendor reserves to himself the right to recover the thing sold, with the obligation to comply with article 1518, and whatever more may have been agreed upon,\" that is, if he recovers the thing sold by repaying the vendee the price of the sale and other\u00a0 expenses.\u00a0 Notwithstanding this condition subsequent, it is a point not at all doubtful now that the vendee may register his title in the same way as the owner of a thing mortgaged-that is to say, the latter with the consent of his\u00a0 creditor and the former with the consent of the vendor.\u00a0 He may alienate the thing bought when the acquirer knows very well from the title entered in the registry that he acquires a title revocable after a fixed period, a thing much more certain and to be expected than the purely contingent expectation of the person in whose favor is reserved a right to inherit some day what another has inherited.\u00a0 The purposes of the law would be defeated in not\u00a0 applying to the person who must make the reservation the provision therein relative to the vendee under <i>pacto de retracto<\/i>, since the argument in his favor is the more powerful and conclusive; <i>ubi eadem ratio, eadem legis dispositio.<\/i><br\/><br\/>Therefore, we reverse the judgment appealed from, and in lieu thereof decide and declare that the applicant is entitled to register in her own name the two parcels of land which are the subject matter of the application, recording in the registration the right required by article 811 to be reserved to either or both of the opponents, Pablo Sablan and Basilio Sablan, should they survive her; without special finding as to costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson<\/i>, and

When the obligation does not fix a term, but it can be inferred from its nature and circumstance that there was an intention of granting it to the debtor, the courts shall fix the duration of such a term.<br\/><br\/>\"The courts shall also fix the duration of a term when it may have been left at the will of the debtor.\"<\/blockquote>The obligation in question seems to leave the duration of the period for the payment thereof to the will of the debtor.\u00a0 It appears also that it was the intention of the instrument to give the debtor time within which to pay the obligation.\u00a0 In such cases this court has held, on several occasions, that the obligation is not due and payable until an action has been commenced by the mortgagee against the mortgagor for the purpose of having the court fix the date on and after which the instrument shall be payable and the date of maturity is fixed in pursuance thereof.\u00a0 The case of Eleizegui <i>vs<\/i>.\u00a0 The Manila Lawn Tennis Club (2 Phil Rep., 309), in which the opinion was written by the Chief Justice of the court, is the leading case upon the subject.\u00a0 In that case the question was over the duration of a lease concerning \"a piece of land for a fixed consideration and to endure at the will of the lessee.\" In discussing the question the court said (p. 310): <br\/><blockquote>\"With respect to the term of the lease the present question has arisen.\u00a0 In its discussion three theories have been presented: One which makes the duration depend upon the will of the lessor, who, upon one month's notice given to the 'lessee, may terminate the lease so stipulated; another which, on the contrary, makes it dependent upon the will of the lessee, as stipulated; and the third, in accordance with which the right is reserved to the court to fix the duration of the term.\"<\/blockquote>The clause on which the case turns is as follows (p. 312):<br\/><blockquote>\"Mr. Williamson, or whoever may succeed him as secretary of the club, may terminate this lease whenever desired without other formality than that of giving a month's notice.\u00a0 The owners of the land undertake to maintain the club as tenant as long as the latter shall see fit.\"<\/blockquote>Considering the case the court said (p. 314):<br\/><blockquote>\"The Civil Code has made provision for such a case in all kinds of obligations.\u00a0 In speaking in general of obligations with a term it has supplied the deficiency of the former law with respect to the 'duration of the term when it has been left to the will of the debtor and provides that in this case the term shall be fixed by the courts. (Art. 1128, sec. 2.)\u00a0 In every contract, as laid down by the authorities, there is always a creditor who is entitled to demand the performance, and a debtor upon whom rests the obligation to perform the undertaking.\u00a0 In bilateral contracts the contracting parties are mutually creditors and debtors.\u00a0 Thus, in this contract of lease, the lessee is the creditor with respect to the rights enumerated in article 1554, and is the debtor with respect to the obligations imposed by articles 1555 and 1561.\u00a0 The term within which performance of the latter obligation is due is what has been left to the will of the debtor.\u00a0 This term it is which must be fixed by the courts,<br\/><br\/>\"The only action which can be maintained under the terms of the contract is that by which it is sought to obtain from the judge the determination of this period, and not the unlawful detainer action which has been brought-an action which presupposes the expiration of the term and makes it the duty of the judge to simply decree an eviction.\u00a0 To maintain the latter action it is sufficient to show the expiration of the term of the contract, whether conventional or legal; in order to decree the relief to be granted in the former action it is necessary for the judge to look into the character and conditions of the mutual undertakings with a view to supplying the lacking element of a time at which the lease is to expire.\"<\/blockquote>The case of Barretto <i>vs<\/i>.\u00a0 The City of Manila (7 Phil. Rep., 416) dealt with a case where the terms of a donation did not fix the time of the performance of the condition placed upon the donation, and the court held that the period must be determined by the court in a proper action in accordance with article 1128 of the Civil Code, saying (p. 420):<br\/><blockquote>\"The contract having fixed no period in which the condition should be fulfilled, the provisions of article 1128 of the Civil Code are applicable and it is the duty of the court to fix a suitable time for its fulfillment. Eleizegui <i>vs<\/i>.\u00a0 The Manila Lawn Tennis Club, 2 Phil. Rep., 309' (11 Phil. Rep., 624.<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup>)<\/blockquote>In the case of Levy Hermanos <i>vs<\/i>. Paterno (18 Phil. Rep., 353) the court said (p. 355):<br\/><blockquote>\"The defendant having bound himself to pay his debt to the plaintiffs in <i>partial payments<\/i>, as set forth in the note in question, it is seen that the obligation is one of payment by installments, since its fulfillment cannot be required immediately nor does its existence depend upon the happening of any particular event.\u00a0 But, though the obligation is one of payment by installments, nevertheless no fixed day was specified for its fulfillment, so that the period for payment is undetermined or was not fixed by the parties when they executed the contract.\u00a0 Besides, it is evident that the term for payment was granted for the exclusive benefit of the defendant and for his own convenience, as by the language of the document, the plaintiffs gained nothing by the fact that the debt was not immediately demandable. Nor was any interest stipulated on the debt during the time that it should remain unpaid by the defendant.\u00a0 For the foregoing reasons, and in whatever manner this case be considered, it is unquestionable that it falls within the provisions of article 1128 of the Civil Code.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>\"The obligation being manifestly defective with regard to the duration of the period granted to the debtor, that is, to the defendant, that defect must be cured by the courts through judicial decision which shall determine the said duration, under the power expressly granted them for such purpose by the legal provisions just above transcribed.<br\/><br\/>\"The trial court, therefore, acted in accordance with the law in exercising the said power in the present case, by fixing the duration of the period on the basis that the payment of the debt should be made at the rate of P200 a month; and we see no abuse of judicial discretion in fixing such a rate, considering the importance of the obligation and the absence of any stipulation of interest in favor of the creditors.\"<\/blockquote>From these decisions it is clear that the instrument sued upon in the case at bar is one which leaves the period of payment at the will of the mortgagor.\u00a0 Such being the case, an action should have been brought for the purpose of having the court set a date on which the instrument should become due and payable.\u00a0 Until such action was prosecuted no suit could be brought for the recovery of the amount named in the instrument.\u00a0 It is, therefore, clear that this action is premature.\u00a0 The instrument has been sued upon before it is due.\u00a0 The action must accordingly be dismissed.<br\/><br\/>Ordinarily, when an action of this sort is dismissed the plaintiff may at once begin his action for the purpose of fixing a date upon which the instrument shall become due.\u00a0 From the undisputed facts in this case and from the facts and conditions that very probably cannot be charged hereafter, it is our present opinion that such action is itself prescribed. Section 38 of the Code of Civil Procedure reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"SEC. 38. <i>To what this chapter does not apply<\/i>.\u2014This chapter shall not apply to actions already commenced, or to cases wherein the right of action has already accrued; but the statutes in force when the action or right of action accrued shall be applicable to such cases according to the subject of the action and without regard to the form; nor shall this chapter apply in the case of a continuing and subsisting trust, nor to an action by the vendee of real property in possession thereof to obtain the conveyance of it: <i>Provided, nevertheless<\/i>, That all rights of action which have already accrued, except those named in the last preceding paragraph, must be vindicated by the commencement of an action or proceeding to enforce the same within ten years after this Act comes into effect.\"<\/blockquote>This section evidently covers all rights of action of whatever kind or nature, except those which have special limitations and are referred to in subsequent sections.\u00a0 A right of action to fix a day for the determination of the time of payment is included within the terms of this section.\u00a0 The mortgage in question having left the period of payment to the will of the mortgagor, an action could have been maintained by the mortgagee at any time after its execution for the naming of a date on which the instrument must be paid in full.\u00a0 That right of action accrued as soon as the instrument was executed. Such action, therefore, falls within the provisions of section 38, and not having been, commenced within the ten years next following the 1st day of October, 1901, such action cannot, under the facts as they now appear, be maintained.<br\/><br\/>While the expression of an opinion as to the prescription of the action to fix a date for the maturity of the obligation in question is unnecessary for a complete resolution of the case before us, still we do not hesitate to express that opinion for the reasons which we have heretofore given in one or two other cases, particularly that of Lichauco <i>vs<\/i>. Limjuco (19 Phil. Rep., 12).\u00a0 That case went off upon the finding of the court that the action could not be maintained by the plaintiff, Lichauco, on behalf of his brothers and sisters and upon that finding the complaint was dismissed. While the merits in that case were not necessarily before us, we nevertheless took up the facts as they appeared and expressed our opinion of what the result of the case would be upon the merits if it subsequently came before us upon the same facts.\u00a0 In that case we said (p. 17):<br\/><blockquote>\"We believe, however, that, for the information of the parties interested in the subject matter of this action and to the end that unnecessary litigation may be avoided, the opinion of the court should be given upon the facts presented in this case.\u00a0 Knowing what our opinion is upon these facts it is probable that the heirs will not care to pursue the litigation further unless, which is somewhat unlikely, they are able to present new facts.\u00a0 We, therefore, proceed to a consideration of the case upon the merits as presented by the record.\"<\/blockquote>The judgment is affirmed, with costs against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

The court erred in declaring that another case is pending in this matter between the same parties.<br\/><br\/>\"2. The court erred in declaring that the foreclosure action instituted has prescribed.<br\/><br\/>\"3. The court erred in holding that the presentation of the claim for collection to the appraisement committee was invalid and destroyed the creditor's right to present an action for collection of the mortgage.<br\/><br\/>\"4. The court erred in absolving the defendants from the complaint.\"<\/blockquote>With reference to the first assignment of error, from an examination of the record we find that on or about the 8th day of May, 1909, the present plaintiff presented the claim contained in\u00a0 said\u00a0 mortgage, constituting the basis of the complaint in the present action, before the commissioners appointed by the court for the purpose of considering claims against the estate of the said Benito San Agustin, and prayed that said commissioners allow said claim in favor of the estate of the said Antonio Osorio and against the estate of Benito San Agustin.\u00a0 After a consideration of said claim, the said commissioners disallowed the same.\u00a0 From that conclusion of the commissioners, the plaintiff appealed to the Court of First Instance.\u00a0 On the 27th day of August, 1910, the plaintiff, in furtherance of said appeal, presented a complaint in the Court of First Instance, in which he alleged the execution and delivery of the mortgage described in the present cause, the fact that said claim\u00a0 had been presented to the said commissioners and had been disallowed, and prayed that the Court of First Instance render a judgment in favor of the estate of the said Antonio Osorio and against the estate of said Benito San Agustin for the amount due on said mortgage, including the P150 stipulated as costs, resulting from the failure of the defendants to pay said mortgage.\u00a0 In that cause (No. 603, Court of First Instance) the said defendant in the\u00a0 present cause, Crisanta Hernandez, appeared and answered and made substantially the same defense which she has made in the present cause (No. 634, Court of First Instance).<br\/><br\/>After hearing the evidence in that cause (No. 603) the Honorable Vicente Jocson, judge, on the 10th day of March, 1911, in a very interesting opinion, reached the following conclusion: \"The court absolves Crisanta Hernandez from the complaint and declares prescribed the action or credit herein claimed by the estate of Antonio Osorio from the estate of Benito San Agustin, sentencing the plaintiff to payment of the\u00a0 costs occasioned to Crisanta Hernandez.\"<br\/><br\/>From that judgment (cause No. 603, Court of First Instance) the plaintiffs gave notice of their intention to appeal.<br\/><br\/>From the foregoing it is clearly seen that the purpose of the present action (No. 634, Court of First Instance) had for its object exactly the same purpose for which said action No. 603 was brought.\u00a0 In other words, the two actions were for the purpose of securing a judgment upon exactly the same indebtedness.\u00a0 The appellant contends that she had a right to maintain the two actions by virtue of the provisions of section 708 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"A creditor holding a claim against the deceased, secured by mortgage or other collateral security, <i>may abandon the security and prosecute his claim before the committee<\/i>, and share in the general distribution of the assets of the estate; or he may foreclose\u00a0 his mortgage or realize upon his security, by ordinary action in court, making the executor or administrator a party defendant;\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.\"<\/blockquote>It is clear by the provisions of said quoted section that a person holding a mortgage against the estate of a deceased person may abandon such security and prosecute his claim before the committee, and share in the distribution of the general assets of the estate.\u00a0 It provides also that he may, at his own election, foreclose the mortgage and realize upon his security.\u00a0 <i>But the law does not provide that he may have both remedies.\u00a0 If he elects one he must abandon the other.<\/i>\u00a0 If he fails in one he fails utterly.\u00a0 He is not permitted, under said section, to annoy those interested in the estates of deceased persona by two actions for exactly the same purpose.\u00a0 A multiplicity of actions is abhorrent to the law and is not permitted in equity and justice:\u00a0 In view of the fact that the plaintiff <i>had elected to abandon<\/i> the security given him by his mortgage and to prosecute his claim before the\u00a0 committee, <i>he forfeited his right to bring an action upon the security in another separate and distinct action<\/i>.\u00a0 With this conclusion, the judgment of the lower court must be affirmed, with\u00a0 costs.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing conclusion, we deem it unnecessary to discuss the other assignments of error made by the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Moreland<\/i>, and <i>Trent, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><br\/><br\/><hr align=\"CENTER\" noshade=\"NOSHADE\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">CONCURRING<\/span><br\/><\/div><br style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\/><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">CARSON, J.,<\/span><br\/><br\/>I concur in the disposition of this case.<br\/><br\/>Merely to avoid possibility of misunderstanding, I think it well to point out that under the provisions of section 708 of Act No. 190, part of which is quoted in the opinion, it would appear that in case a creditor elects to rely upon his mortgage he may foreclose his mortgage or realize upon the security by an ordinary action in court, making the executor or administrator a party defendant; and if there is a judgment for a deficiency after the sale of the mortgaged premises or the other property pledged in the foreclosure or other proceeding, he may prove his deficiency judgment before the committee and to that amount he may share in the general assets of the estate of the deceased.\u00a0 In other words, a creditor holding a claim against the deceased person secured by mortgage or other collateral security may rely upon his security and institute an ordinary action based thereon without abandoning his right to present his claim to the committee should the security not be sufficient to pay the debt.<br\/><br\/>I call attention to this because the language of the majority opinion seems to me to go too far in declaring that \"the law does not provide that he (the creditor) may have both remedies.\u00a0 If he elects one he must abandon the other.\"\u00a0 While that statement is true as a general proposition, nevertheless the express language of section 708 of Act No. 190 evidently contemplates that in the case just mentioned the creditor may rely upon both remedies.<br\/><br\/>The case at bar does not fall under this exception to the general rule, and I concur with the disposition of this case in the majority opinion. <\/div>",

Rep., 343, the said strip of land was adjudged to belong to the aforenamed\u00a0 spouses, precisely against the claims of the\u00a0 opponent, Luis Perez Samanillo, made in case No. 4548 of the Court of Land Registration; and that the opponent had not up to date and within the period allowed of forty days presented an amended plan excluding such land therefrom as he was directed to do by the Court of Land Registration on January 9, 1911.\u00a0 He therefore asked that the adverse claim filed by Luis Perez Samanillo be denied, and that the latter be directed to pay the costs and to comply with the said order of January 9, 1911, given in case No. 4548 aforementioned.<br\/><br\/>After the hearing and the introduction of evidence by both parties the judgment before referred to was rendered, to which counsel for Perez Samanillo excepted and asked for a new trial.\u00a0 This motion was denied and the proper bill of exceptions having been presented, the same was approved and forwarded to the clerk of this court with a transcript of the evidence.<br\/><br\/>The object sought in this case is the inscription in the Court of Land Registration of three adjoining parcels of land, situated on Calle David, Binondo, and belonging to Allison D. Gibbs and Eva Johnson Gibbs, who acquired one of them, Lot 1, with the building thereon, by purchase from the spouses Vicente Gonzalez and Manuela Eugenia Salvador, and the other two parcels, described as lots 2 and 3, by exchange with the city of Manila.<br\/><br\/>The said application for the registration of the aforementioned property was opposed only by the counsel for Luis Perez Samanillo,\u00a0 who alleged that his client was the owner of the parcel or strip of land comprised, in the plan presented, between the lines 3 and 4 and a line parallel to line 4, drawn from the point No. 5, and that this property had been held in peaceable possession by the opponent and his predecessors in interest from time immemorial.<br\/><br\/>This same strip of land has already been the subject matter of a suit maintained by the herein opponent, Luis Perez Samanillo, who applied for the registration of his property situated on Calle Escolta and bounded on the rear by the property previously owned by the spouses Vicente Gonzalez and Manuela Eugenio Salvador y Padilla and afterwards, on February 2, 1911, sold by them to the present applicants, Mr, and Mrs. Gibbs.\u00a0 The said strip of land lies between the property of Luis Perez Samanillo, in its northwest side, and that which formerly belonged to the said Vicente Gonzalez and Manuela Eugenia Salvaldor, on its southeast side.\u00a0 Upon the trial of the case before the Court of Land Registration, it was held in the judgment rendered on December 27, 1909, that the piece of land in dispute was an integral part of the applicant Perez Samanillo's lot, in whose name it was ordered to be registered, and Vicente Gonzalez' adverse claim was rejected; but the Supreme Court, in its\u00a0 decision of November 19, 1910, upon affirming the judgment appealed from, ordered the exclusion of the said disputed strip of land, for the reason that it was held to belong to the opponent, Vicente Gonzalez, without prejudice to any rights of easement which might encumber the small excluded lot in favor of the registered property.\u00a0 The findings\u00a0 which, among others, served as a basis for the aforesaid decision\u00a0 of this court, are those herein below transcribed:<br\/><blockquote>\"By an examination of the plan and technical description accompanying the application and of the description of the opponent's property given in his title inscribed in the registry of property, page 129, it is observed that, while the division line of the two properties consists of two straight lines with one short perpendicular line crossing them at their point of meeting, as shown in the said plan, in the aforesaid title this division appears as a broken line composed of five straight lines with two chamfers, the first line 19.95 meters long, the second line, the first chamfer, 4.50\u00a0 meters long, the third 27.40 meters long, the fourth, the second chamfer, 2.60 meters long, and the fifth, 2.38 meters in length.\u00a0 From these two contradictory descriptions it is deduced that, if the applicant's plan is taken as correct, the space of land in litigation forms a part of his property, while to judge from the text of the opponent's title the said fractional lot is comprised within his title and cannot be a part of the applicant's property.\u00a0 It is impossible that the divisional line of the two adjoining lots could be formed at the same time by two straight lines on one side and by five straight lines and two chamfers on the other.<br\/><br\/>\"When the applicant's building was erected in 1887, for many years, since before 1883, the opponent's building, with its stone wall and a door opening into the small disputed lot, had been in existence, and in the two titles of the two adjoining lots, on which the applicant's building was erected no record appears of the form and configuration of the lots on the side adjacent to the\u00a0 opponent's property, while in the latter's title there is shown\u00a0 the configuration of his lot and the different forms in which the same adjoins the two immediate lots, surrounded by their respective stone walls, before their sale to the applicant's father.\u00a0 From all of these facts it is concluded that the small lot in question belongs to the opponent and forms a part of the land on which his building is constructed, inasmuch as the detailed description of its boundaries coincides with the configuration of the said land on the side thereof which is adjacent to the applicant's lots, according to the plan in the trial record, and the wall of the said opponent's building, from the first central chamfer, runs in a straight line, parallel with the wall of the applicant's building, toward the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">estero<\/span>, with the little disputed lot between them both; moreover, it does not appear that the said wall of the opponent had two chamfers and lay in five straight lines, assuming the configuration described in the applicant's plan and title:\u00a0 Wherefore it is unquestionable that the said disputed lot is of the form described, on its side adjacent to the applicant's property.<br\/><br\/>\"The lots pertaining to each one of the said buildings, Nos. 37 and 39 of Calle Escolta, which were destroyed by the fire, must have been surrounded by a wall on their boundary line adjoining the lot of the building at No. 28 Calle David; whence it is that, in the instrument of sale, at least of the lot occupied by the\u00a0 building numbered 39 before the fire, mention is made of walls and stone pavement, an important detail, because the space of land in question, in nearly its entire length, adjoins this lot and does not appear to be included in the aforesaid instrument of sale (pp.\u00a0 109 to 116 of the record), and therefore it must be found that the said disputed strip of land was not comprised in the sale made to Perez by Keller's representative, in March, 1886.<br\/><br\/>\"The opponent averred that the said disputed lot belonged to him and, since 1833 or 1834, had been in his possession and that of his wife and her predecessors, which was confirmed by one of the latter, Maria Barbara Padilla, who declared in an affidavit that when her father, Narciso Padilla, acquired the building at No. 28 Calle David in the year mentioned, the strip of land in dispute formed a part of the lot on which the said building stood and that the disputed land was used and enjoyed ever afterwards by her father and herself, without any objection on the part of the owners of the two adjoining properties.\u00a0 This witness added that when she first began to live in the said building she was seven years of age; that, to provide a means of entrance to the land in controversy, a doorway, which still existed, had been opened\u00a0 through the wall of the said building, No. 28, the eaves of the roof of which shed water onto the said lot, where her father and her family were accustomed to store lumber and other things and where they kept hogs and other animals; that there was also a window with a projecting iron grating in the upper story of the building and which overlooked the lot in litigation without objection or complaint by anybody.<br\/><br\/>\"The existence of the said door, which allowed entrance to the little lot from the opponent's house, appears to be confirmed by the testimony of Jose M.a Arriola, the applicant's attorney in fact, and of Otto Mur, the manager of the firm of Sprungli &amp; Co., the tenants of the opponent's building, and by the evidence obtained during the ocular inspection held by the court on the said small lot and on the adjoining properties.\u00a0 Moreover, the said Arriola testified that, when the water-closet was built on the end of the disputed strip of land, toward the <i>estero<\/i>, the inclosing partition was constructed on the side away from the <i>estero<\/i>, and on a diagonal line, for the purpose of respecting the said door opened in the wall of the opponent's building, a detail confirmed by the proceedings of inspection.<br\/><br\/>\"The petitioner Perez having erected his building in 1887, if he were the owner of the strip of land in question he would at least have constructed his walls on the part of this strip on which the water from the eaves of the opponent's house did not fall; and if he did not do so, it was because he then believed that he should respect another's real property in the same manner that he did the\u00a0 door opened in the opponent's wall.<br\/><br\/>\"The small area of land in litigation is approximately two meters and some few centimeters in width, and the successive owners of the house No. 28 of Calle David and their tenants have exercised acts of dominion over the said land, for the eaves of this house extended over it and shed the rain water thereupon, the iron grating of a window opened in the upper story of the said house projects half a meter over the said land and from this space receives light, and the said owners and tenants have been in the habit of entering upon the property by passing through the door before mentioned, for the purpose of enjoying the full and free use thereof, while no exit whatever existed from the applicant's building to the said strip of land, and if sometimes his tenants were obliged to enter the same they had to pass through the lot on which the opponent's house stands, after obtaining permission from the latter's tenants, and through the only door there which was opened in the wall of this house.<br\/><br\/>\"Article 582 of the Civil Code prescribes:<br\/><br\/>\" 'Windows with direct views, or balconies or any similar openings projecting over the estate of the neighbor, can not be made if there is not a distance of, at least, two meters between the wall in which they are built and the said estate.<br\/><br\/>\" 'Neither can side nor oblique views be opened over said property, unless there is a distance of sixty centimeters.'<br\/><br\/>\"Article 586 of the same code also provides:<br\/><br\/>\" The owner of a building is obliged to construct his roofs or coverings in such a manner that rain water may fall on his own land or on the street or public place, and not on the land of his neighbor.\u00a0 Even if it falls on his own land, the owner is obliged to collect it in such manner that it will not injure the adjoining estate<br\/><br\/>\"Had the applicant or some of his remote predecessors owned the strip of land in question, they would not have consented to the opponents' house, No. 28, being constructed with a roof and window\u00a0 grating projecting or extending over their property, nor would they have permitted the rain water from such a roof to fall onto it to the detriment of their rights and interests, which are protected by the civil law, both ancient and modern, in accordance with the prein serted articles of the code.<br\/><br\/>\"If for more than seventy-five years, up to the date of the commencement of this suit, the opponents' building has been maintained with the said projections and entrance door to the land in question without objection or complaint on the part of the successive owners of the two adjacent properties, it is because the said strip of land forms an integral part of the opponents' property and never belonged to the applicant's predecessors, and the trial record shows not even circumstantial evidence that the applicant or his predecessors ever were in possession of or exercised any acts of ownership over the said strip of land.\"<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><\/div><br\/>The recent act of the applicant's representative in having opened a door affording entrance from his property to the fractional lot in question, as appears by the written notice given to this court by the opponent on the 28th of July of this year, does not affect the reasoning herein set forth, but, on the contrary, confirms the conclusion that the said lot does not belong to the applicant, but is the property of the opponent.\"\u00a0 (17 Phil. Rep., 343.)<\/blockquote>The foregoing findings are perfectly applicable to the present suit and determine the proper and just resolution of the issues in controversy between the parties.<br\/><br\/>On the hearing of this case before the Court of Land Registration,\u00a0 on August 17, 1911, Miguel Rosales, as the attorney in fact of Perez Samanillo, exhibited a plan and stated that his opposition was based solely on his claim that the easements of right of way and eaves' drip should be recognized and respected by the applicants (record, p. 51); but by a written petition presented on the following day (record, p. 53) counsel for the opponent Perez Samanillo asked for the denial of the application for registration, in so far as the said strip of land was concerned, for the reason, as he alleged, that the opponent was the owner of this strip of land, comprised between the lines 3 and 4 and a line parallel to line 4, running from point No. 5, and that he and his predecessors in interest had held the same in peaceable possession as its owners, from time immemorial.<br\/><br\/>The evidence adduced at trial shows that, on the proposal of the opponent's attorney, the parties agreed that the strip of land in question was the same trip that was the subject of controversy in case No. 4548 of the Court of Land Registration and No. 5897 of this court, wherein the said Perez Samanillo was the applicant for\u00a0 the registration of that piece of property.<br\/><br\/>The plan, Exhibit 1 (presented\u00a0 by the opponent's attorney, page 177 of the record, for the purpose of proving that the strip of land in\u00a0 litigation is not shown to be included therein, notwithstanding that it was exhibited by Vicente Gonzalez in the Bureau of Internal Revenue as the basis for the assessment of the property, lot No. 1, now sought to be registered), is admitted by this court at its face value and in spite of the applicant Gibbs' objection on the ground that it is not duly authenticated; however, from a subsequent certificate issued by an official of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (record,\u00a0 p. 131) it appears that the said plan, Exhibit 1, was on file in his department, though\u00a0 there was no record as to who presented it there on the 20th of January,\u00a0 1902, the date of the memorandum of its receipt, while the sworn declaration of August 30, 1901 (record, p. 27), which served as a basis for the computation of the land tax for 1902, shows that the said strip of land was comprised therein, according to the rough sketch drawn on its reverse side.\u00a0 It is, therefore, unquestionable that when the tax was paid on the entire property, the proportional amount thereof pertaining to this strip was included in that payment.<br\/><br\/>The opponent's witness, Jose Arriola, testified that the present buildings\u00a0 of the opponent were constructed sometime between 1885 and 1886; that the wall or partition, designated on the plan, Exhibit A, as between the letter C, written in pencil, and the point No. 5, and the doorway opened in the said wall and which serves as a means of communication between the applicant's lot and the strip of land in question, were both very old, for they were already in existence before the opponent's buildings were erected; that the new doorway, opened between the points 4 and 5, was constructed subsequent to the rendition of the judgment of the Court of Land Registration, in the previous case, and because without it there was no means whatever of ingress from the opponent's property to the strip of land in dispute, so that, in order to clean this ground of mud and rubbish, it was necessary to enter the <i>zaguan<\/i> or interior porch of the applicants' house and thence pass through the said old doorway indicated on the plan, Exhibit A, between the No. 5 and the penciled letter.<br\/><br\/>From the preceding evidence it is concluded that the strip of land in question now belongs to the applicants, the successors in interest of the spouses Vicente Gonzalez and Manuela Eugenia Salvador who in the former decision of this court, before mentioned, were adjudged to be its owners.\u00a0 Such ownership, moreover, was admitted by the opponent himself in the proceedings had before the Court of First Instance for the issuance of an injunction, initiated by the said spouses and predecessors in interest of the applicants.<br\/><br\/>So that, even though it would have been possible in law to decide this suit in accordance with the merits and proofs found in the record, upon duly examining and weighing them in conformity with the rules of sound judgment and common sense and with entire independence of the previous decision of this court declaratory of the rights of the applicants' vendors in the strip of land in question, our final conclusions would undoubtedly not have been in favor of the opponent who, in this second litigation as in the first, did not succeed in proving that he was the owner and proprietor of the portion of land expressly excluded, by the former decision, from the registration of his property.<br\/><br\/>The applicants have proved in a satisfactory manner that they acquired by a lawful deed of conveyance the three parcels of land, together with the buildings thereon, the registration of which they have applied for and have furnished a description of their respective areas and boundaries for the purpose of their indispensable registration; consequently, the opponent's petition must be\u00a0 denied.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the easements, also referred,to in the judgment appealed from, it is not deemed necessary to treat of them in this decision, inasmuch as the appellant has not alleged the commission of any error in respect thereto by the lower court in the judgment appealed from.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, whereby the errors assigned to the trial judge are deemed to have been refuted, we should affirm, as we do hereby, the judgment appealed from, with the costs against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Mapa, Moreland<\/i>, and <i>Trent, JJ<\/i>., concur. <\/div>",

Abreu absolved the defendant, Inocentes Fuentes, from the complaint, with the right to collect from the plaintiff the costs of the trial.\u00a0 Counsel for the latter moved for a reopening of the case and a new hearing, which motion was overruled by an order of January 8, 1910, whereupon said counsel excepted.<br\/><br\/>On July 21, 1908, counsel for Agustin Aldea filed a written complaint in the Court of First Instance of Capiz against Inocentes Fuentes, setting forth that, by virtue of an instrument executed in his favor by Juana de la Pena, on May 24, 1905, before the justice of the.peace of Mambusao, he was the owner of two parcels of irrigated land situated in the places known as Ilo and Naboongan, Mambusao, of 4 hectares 27 ares and 86 centares, being bounded on the north by the property of Maria Arluida, on the east by Calle San Jose, on the south by the property of Diego Orleans, Ramon Veedor, and Juan Lopez; and on the west by the properties of Juan Lopez and Sixto Lema; and the second parcel of 1 hectare 74 ares and 80 centares, on the north by the property of Luciana Laguda; on the east by and on the south by that of Santiago de la Cena; and on the west by the Dumalag Road; that, prior to the date of the sale of the said land, March 2, 1900, Juana de la Pe\u00f1a had mortgaged the same to Pedro Arcenas as security for a debt she owed him, and, the said debt not having been paid by Pe\u00f1a at its maturity, the latter stipulated with the plaintiff, Aldea, that she should sell him the lands in question, in consideration whereof he should pay her debt to Arcenas, which was done; that, on or about the month of February, 1907, while Aldea was in the full enjoyment of possession and usufruct of the said lands the defendant, Fuentes, took possession of them, despoiling him of possession thereof, and by intimidation obliged the latter's tenant, Vito Navarra, to cease to occupy and cultivate them; that, when a demand was made upon Fuentes for the restitution of the said lands, he refused to restore them and unlawfully continued to bold them from February, 1907; and that, as a result of such despoliation, the plaintiff had been deprived of the fruits and products of the said lands, whereby he had suffered loses and damages to the amount of P600.\u00a0 He therefore asked that judgment be rendered in his behalf by sentencing the defendant to the payment of the said sum as losses and damages, to restore to the plaintiff the said two parcels of land, and to pay the costs of the trial.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the defendant in reply denied each and all of the allegations contained in each and all of the paragraphs of the complaint, and, as a special defense, set forth: that the land held by Juana de la Pena in the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">sitio<\/span> of Naboongan, also known as Maralag, the boundaries whereof were described in paragraph 1 of the complaint, was then partially under the control of the plaintiff's mother-in-law, Josef Jaber, with whom he was living, and partially under that erf one Euittquio Aro; that the land held by the defendant in the <i>sitio<\/i> of Ilo, Mambusao, has an area of only \"2 cavanes and 10 <i>gantas<\/i> of seed rice\" and does not amount to 4 hectares and 86 ares, which land he had acquired from Juana de la Pe\u00f1a in payment of a debt and had possessed without interruption since 1901; that Pe\u00f1a had another parcel of land in the same <i>sitio<\/i> of Ilo, of an area of \"half a <i>cavan<\/i> of seed rice,\" adjoining: the land he had received from the said Pena, which parcel of land was to have been conveyed to him by Pe\u00f1a aa a part of the land not mortgaged in his name, but that, instead of so doing, she conveyed it to Josefa Jabar, the plaintiff Aldea's mother-in-law; and that the said parcel of land was then in the possession of Dalmacio Navarra, an uncle by marriage of the plaintiff. He therefore prayed that he be absolved from the complaint, with the costs against the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>The case came to trial on July 17, 1909, evidence was introduced by both parties, and, on October 12 of the same year, the judgment aforementioned was rendered.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff in this case claims to own a certain piece of land of 4 hectares 27 ares and 86 centares, situated in the place called Ilo, of the pueblo of Mambusao, of which he alleges he was violently despoiled by the defendant, who, he avers, has usurped the same since February, 1907.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding the allegations of Agustin Aldea in his complaint, it is not shown by the record to have been duly proved that the plaintiff was in possession of at least the parcel of land of the area of \"2 <i>cavanes<\/i> and 10 <i>gantas<\/i> of seed rice,\" which the defendant, Inocentes Fuentes, now holds and has held since 1901 when it was conveyed to him through a contract of antichresis because its original owner, Juana de la Pe\u00f1a, had not paid him a sum which she had owed him from July 23, 1900, as evidenced by Exhibit 2, translated on the next page.<br\/><br\/>If the plaintiff Aldea has not succeeded in proving in this suit the right of possession which he claims to have in the land of lesser area now held by the defendant by virtue of a perfectly legal contract executed between the latter and the previous owner of the land, in 1890, neither has he proved the alleged despoliation or usurpation which the plaintiff charges the defendant with having committed, through a violent act performed one day of the month of February, 1907, and consequently there is no lawful reason for the success in law of the improper complaint whereby this litigation was commenced.<br\/><br\/>Though it be true that Juana de la Pe\u00f1a may have sold to Agustin Aldea, in May, 1905, a parcel of land of greater area, as stated in Exhibit A, and the land now held by the defendant was comprised within that sale, yet once it is proved that on the said date the vendor was not in possession nor could dispose of the land of the area of \"2 <i>cavanes<\/i> and 10 <i>gantas<\/i>\" which she herself had, many years before through a legal contract, ceded or conveyed to her creditor, Inocentes Fuentes, the latter being in legitimate possession of the land which he had received from his debtor by virtue of the contract recorded in the said Exhibit 2, therein translated, it is not proper nor just that the defendant be deprived of his legitimate possession upon the petition of Agustin Aldea who, in order to give an honest appearance to his claim, which he himself probably believed was not a lawful one, saw fit to allege an act of despoliation that could not have been performed, and which he did not succeed in proving, for the reason that the alleged despoiler was, in 1907, in legitimate possession of the land said to have been unlawfully seized in 1901, as shown to have been fully proven at the trial and according to the opinion very correctly held by the lower court in the judgment appealed from.<br\/><br\/>In addition to the lack of due proof of the possession and despoliation alleged by the plaintiff in his complaint, the defendant, on his part, proved in a satisfactory and conclusive manner that from 1901 to 1904 four persons successively leased the land in question on shares, subject to the defendant Fuentes' control, and that subsequently the original owner herself, Juana de la Pena, and Vito Navarra leased from this same defendant the said land of \"2 <i>cavanes<\/i> and 10 <i>gantas<\/i> of seed rice\" in area, though the latter afterwards had to rescind the lease in 1907 on account of Navarra's failure to pay rent for the years 1905 and 1906, wherefore Fuentes had to sue him in the justice of the peace court of Mambusao and obtained a judgment against him; but Navarra appealed therefrom to the Court of First Instance where, through agreement of the parties, the case was left pending until the judgment in the present suit.<br\/><br\/>The witness Vito Navarra, presented by the plaintiff Aldea as having been a former lessee of the land, according to a contract of lease which Navarra himself stated he had executed with Pedro Arcenas, a former possessor and transferee of the land, denied that he ever was a tenant on shares and lessee of the defendant, Inocente Fuentes; but the testimony of this witness is invalidated by the evidence introduced by the defendant and by the letter, Exhibit 1, addressed to the latter, wherein Vito Navarra requested Fuentes to permit him to cultivate the land concerning which the writer had already spoken to the defendant; and, as held by the trial court in his judgment, the Exhibits F and G, which purport to be receipts issued by Pedro Arcenas to Vito Navarra, on December 25, 1905, and January 15, 1907, each for 20 <i>cavanes<\/i> of rice, are not credible, in view of the facts and circumstances stated in the said judgment, for the reason that both documents were written at the same time on two parts of one and the same sheet of paper divided into halves. '<br\/><br\/>If it is true that, since May 24, 1905, the plaintiff, Agustin Aldea, has been the owner of the land of greater area, including the property in dispute, and that Pedro Arcenas since that date has ceased to own the same, it is inexplicable how, on December 25, 1905, and on January 15, 1907, according to said receipts, Exhibits F and G, Arcenas still could have collected rents from the land of which he was no longer the owner or possessor, but which was held and owned by Aldea, according to the latter's allegations. <br\/><br\/>Aside from this positive conclusion derived from the evidence, it was proved furthermore, that the defendant, Fuentes, has been since 1902 paying the land tax on the said land of the area of \"2 <i>cavanes<\/i> and 10 <i>gantas<\/i> of seed rice,\" which had been levied against him from that year up to date, a fact the plaintiff could not establish.<br\/><br\/>Article 445 of the Civil Code prescribes: \"Possession, as a fact, cannot be recognized in two different personalities, except in cases where there is no division. Should a question arise as to the fact of the possession, the actual possessor shall be preferred; when there are two, the oldest shall be preferred; if the dates of the possession are the same, the one presenting a title; and if all these conditions are equal, the thing shall be placed in deposit or judicial keeping until the possession or ownership thereof is decided in the proper manner.\"<br\/><br\/>Solely with reference to the possession of the land in litigation, it is unquestionable that the defendant Fuentes, the present possessor of the property, has been in possession thereof longer than the plaintiff, and, on the hypothesis that Juana de la Pe\u00f1a delivered the land to the defendant, Inocentes Fuentes, under a lawful contract it is undeniable that the debtor, Pena, cannot reacquire the enjoyment of the land that is the subject of the antichresis, without previously paying in full what she owes to her creditor (art. 1883 of the Civil Code); and it cannot be alleged that the plaintiff has a better right, since the contract contained in the instrument, Exhibit 2, executed by Pe\u00f1a in the defendant's favor bears a date long prior to that of the instrument presented by the plaintiff, Exhibit Although this latter document was certified by the justice of the peace of Mambusao, but is not, however, of a public character and the said justice of the peace, when he certified it, did not hold the office of notary.<br\/><br\/>For all the foregoing reasons, whereby the errors assigned to the judgment appealed from are deemed to have been refuted, such judgment should be, as it is hereby, affirmed, with the costs against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Mapa<\/i>, and <i>Johnson, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><i>Trent, J<\/i>., concurs in the result.<br\/><\/div>",

from a judgment of the Court of Land Registration denying the registration of the title to certain parcels of land prayed for by the petitioner.<br\/><br\/>The prayer is for the registration of the title to 51 parcels of land in various municipalities of the Province of Ilocos Norte.\u00a0 Titles to certain of the parcels were refused registration by the court and appeals were taken in these cases.<br\/><br\/>The questions presented on the\u00a0 appeal are very largely those of fact.\u00a0 We have carefully taken up one by one the parcels involved in this appeal and have examined the plan and the evidence, both documentary and oral, presented in reference thereto.\u00a0 In each one of them we find the decision of the court thoroughly sustained by the evidence.\u00a0 By this we do not mean to say that evidence to the contrary was not found in each case, but in none would we feel justified in holding that the decision of the court was against the fair preponderance of the\u00a0 evidence.\u00a0 Neither the petitioner nor the respondents presented paper titles.\u00a0 Their rights are founded upon possession merely.<br\/><br\/>The petitioner presented what it claims to be a title to a large part of the land involved in the litigation.\u00a0 We do not so consider it.\u00a0 It consists merely in a certificate executed by the Archbishop in which he asserts that the Church is the owner of the lands described therein.\u00a0 This certificate was registered in the registry of property.\u00a0 This certificate is merely a self-serving statement issued by the person in interest.\u00a0 It does not have the force or effect of an instrument issued by a Government official upon any proceeding relating to the ownership of lands known to the Spanish law in force at the\u00a0 time the certificate was made.\u00a0 It is not a title known as a <i>composicion con el estado<\/i> nor is it a title known as an <i>informacion posesoria<\/i>.\u00a0 We have been cited to no law which gives to the registration of such a certificate any force\u00a0 or effect as a title, particularly against persons who were in possession\u00a0 of the land or who had an interest therein at the time the certificate was made and registered.\u00a0 It appears in the evidence in this case that all of the respondents who are here as appellees, either by themselves or their predecessors in interest, were in possession of the parcels of land to which they make claim of ownership at the time this certificate was made and registered.<br\/><br\/>The only evidence of title being parol testimony relative to possession, we must, perforce, follow the judgment of the trial court as to the relative credibility of the witnesses who testified for the parties, there appearing nothing in the record indicating that the judge erred in that regard.\u00a0 The credibility of the witnesses having been disposed of, the only remaining question is the due appreciation of the probative force of the evidence adduced.\u00a0 As we have already said, a careful examination of the evidence relative to each parcel concerning which there is a contest does not disclose grounds upon which we may consistently declare that the trial court in any particular instance resolved the questions involved against the fair preponderance of the evidence.<br\/><br\/>The appellant objects to the form of the decree registering title to the parcels of which the court found the petitioner the owner.\u00a0 The court decreed the registration of a number of parcels of land in favor of the Roman Catholic Bishop of Nueva Segovia \"in trust for the use, purpose, behoof, and sole benefit of the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church in these Islands.\"\u00a0 The purpose of the court in framing the decree in this\u00a0 wise was evidently to comply with the provisions of section 157 of the Corporation\u00a0 Law\u00a0 (Act No. 1459)\u00a0 as it understood them.\u00a0 This section provides that, where a bishop or other prelate mentioned has filed the certificate required by section 154 and following sections\u00a0 of the\u00a0 Corporation Law, he \"shall become a corporation sole, and all temporalities, estates, and properties of the religious denomination, society, or church, theretofore administered or managed by him as\u00a0 such bishop, chief priest, or presiding elder shall be held in\u00a0 trust by him as a corporation sole, for the use, purpose, behoof, and sole benefit of his religious denomination, society, or church, including hospitals, schools, colleges, orphan asylums, parsonages, and cemeteries thereof.\"<br\/><br\/>We are of the opinion that the contention of the appellant in which it claims that the decree should be modified by striking out that portion which\u00a0 provides that the registration shall be in trust for the use, purpose, behoof, and sole benefit of the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church in these Islands must be sustained.\u00a0 There is a large\u00a0 difference between registering title in the name of the Roman Catholic Bishop of Nueva Segovia in trust for the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church and in registering title in the name of the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church.\u00a0 In the one case the title would be in the Roman Catholic Bishop of Nueva Segovia, while in the other it would be in the Roman Catholic Church.\u00a0 In the one case the Church has only the beneficial use, in the other it has absolute ownership.\u00a0 In the one case the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church is a <i>cestui que trust<\/i>, in the other the owner.\u00a0 The form of the decree as made by the Court of Land Registration would result,\u00a0 if strictly construed, in defeating the purposes of the law which it sought to follow instead of carrying out its provisions.\u00a0 The proper way to proceed is to decree the registration of title in the name of the petitioner as in any other case.\u00a0 After the decree is entered, the Corporation Law, section 157, operates and declares that the title to the property is in the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church, where, in all these cases, it is found to be, and the Bishop of Nueva Segovia is administering it as the representative of that Church.\u00a0 Moreover, it has been the practice in the courts of the Islands to bring actions and proceedings in favor of the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church in the name of the archbishop or the bishop of the locality, it having been held by this court repeatedly, and it being\u00a0 generally understood, that any judgment rendered in such an action or proceeding is in favor of or against the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church and not in favor of or against the archbishop or the bishop individually or as a separate and independent corporation.<br\/><br\/>The decree of registration is hereby modified by striking out the phrase \"in trust for the use, purpose, behoof, and sole benefit of the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church in these Islands,\" and, as so modified, is affirmed.\u00a0 No costs in this instance.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

S. Crossfield, judge, found the defendant guilty of the crime charged in the complaint and on account of the fact that he was but 16 years of age, ordered that he should be confined on the Lolomboy estate for one year eight months and twenty-one days, or until a new order of the court should be made.\u00a0 From that sentence the defendant appealed to this court.<br\/><br\/>A question of fact only is presented by the appellant.\u00a0 The appellant alleges that the proof adduced during the trial of the cause in the lower court was not sufficient to show that he was guilty of the crime charged, beyond a reasonable doubt.<br\/><br\/>The proof shows that the defendant was less than 16 years of age; that the offended party, Antonia Silvestre, was less than 17 years of age; that at the solicitation of the defendant Antonia Silvestre, at or about 7 o'clock on the evening of the 16th of May, 1912, left her mother's house without the knowledge of her mother; that she went to a side street near the place where they lived where the defendant was waiting in a carromata; that the\u00a0 defendant took the said Antonia Silvestre in a carromata which he had rented, to a place which he stated was the house of a minister, and then said to Antonia that they could not be married because they were too young; that the defendant immediately thereafter took the said Antonia Silvestre to the house of one Justa Arran, in the District of Tayuman, and kept her there for several days, during which time he had illicit relations with her, under a promise that he would later marry her.<br\/><br\/>It seems clear from the record that Antonia Silvestre left her home without the knowledge of her parents and consented to the said illicit relations by virtue of the promise of marriage made to her by the defendant.\u00a0 The defendant attempted to prove that he had been abducted by the said Antonia Silvestre; that he went with her, after she had escaped from her home, without the knowledge of her parents, to the house of Justa Arran, and there had illicit relations with her at her request.\u00a0 The lower court did not believe the contention of the defendant, and there is nothing in the record to justify this court in changing the findings of fact of the lower court.<br\/><br\/>The proof shows that the said\u00a0 Antonia Silvestre was abducted with her consent.\u00a0 The defendant should, therefore, be punished in accordance with article 446 of the Penal Code.\u00a0 In view, however, of the fact that he was over 15 years of age and less than 18 years of age, the penalty to be imposed under said article, in relation with paragraph 2 of article 85, must be <i>arresto mayor<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>It will be remembered that the lower court sentenced the defendant to be confined at Lolomboy farm, for a period of one year eight months and twenty-one days, or until a further order of the court.\u00a0 Said imprisonment was imposed by the lower court in accordance with the provisions of Act No. 1438.\u00a0 Section 1 of said Act provides that:<br\/><blockquote>\"Whenever any male minor between the ages of eight and sixteen or any female between the ages of eight and eighteen shall be found guilty by any court of competent jurisdiction of an offense not punishable by life imprisonment or death, the court, instead of directing the confinement of such minor in any public prison or jail, may, <i>in its discretion<\/i>, suspend judgment and commit such minor to the custody of any orphan asylum, reform school, charitable society, or society for the prevention of cruelty to children, or to any other charitable or educational institution having for its purpose the care, betterment, reform, or education of minors <i>until such minor shall have reached his, majority, or for such less period as to the court may seem proper<\/i>,\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.\"<\/blockquote>It will be noted that the period of confinement in such institution is within the discretion of the court, limited only by the period of time between the age of the defendant and his year of\u00a0 majority.\u00a0 The penalty imposed by the lower court is entirely within the provisions of the law and we find no reason for changing the same.\u00a0 Therefore the sentence of the lower court is hereby affirmed with costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

En defensa especial alego que el referido terreno fue legalmente vendido a consecuencia de una ejecucion contra Esteban Ocerin y fue comprado por el demandado cuyo terreno era realmente de Ocerin en la epoca de la venta y si se ha hecho por este alguna trasferencia al demandante, la impugna por ser fraudulenta y con motivo de impedir la demandado de hacer uso de sus derechos adquiridos mediante la venta por el Sheriff.<br\/><br\/>Celebrada vista del juicio y practicadas las pruebas suministradas por las partes, el Juez con fecha 27 de Octubre de 1910 dicto la decision de que se ha hecho merito, contra la cual se excepcionaron ambas partes y las mismas pidieron celebracion de nueva vista,cuyas modines fueron denegadas pidieron celebracion de nueva vista, cuyas modines fueron denegadas con las respectivas excepciones por ambas partes las cuales convinieron en que se presentaria una sola pieza de excepciones, como asi hizo, la cual fue aprobada y elevada a la Escribania de esta Corte.<br\/><br\/>Se trata en este asunto de la reivindicacion de un terreno de la propiedad del demandante que fue embargado y vendido a peticion de un acreedor a las resultas de un juicio seguido sobre cobro de cierta cantidad que adeuda un tercero que ha sido el anterior dueno del terreno vendido.<br\/><br\/>Resulta de autos probado que Esteban ocerin vendio con pacto de retro en 10 de Diciembre de 1907 la parcela de terrenoddescrita en el parrafo 3.o de la demanda al demandante Benito Carino en la cantidad de P50 pesos con el pacto de poder recomprarlo dentro del termino de un ano a contar desde la citada fecha y por no haberlo hecho quedo consolidado el dominio del comprador Benito Carino sobre de dicho inmueble del cual desde entonces ha venido poseyendo por mediode sus encargados Margarito Obnala y Regino Panesares que eran los que recogian el abaca cosechado y lo entregaban a su dueno.<br\/><br\/>Tambien resulta que embargado dicho terreno fue vendido por el Sheriff en 27 de Marzo de 1909 por cierta deuda de Esteban ocerin, habiendose adjudicado el inmueble a favor del chino Lim Quionjui acreedor a cuya instancia se procedio el embargo, no habiendose probado que haya habido fraude por parte del anterior dueno el citado Esteban Ocerin ni del comprador Benito Carino que es el unico y legitimo dueno del terreno.<br\/><br\/>El contrato de compra y venta consignado en un documento privado, reconocido por los que lo han suscrito es perfectamente valido y eficaz siempre que en el concurran las condiciones esenciales establecidad en el Art. 1261 de Codigo Civil.<br\/><br\/>En un pleito de terceria de dominio no es improcedente la admision de un documento privado expresivo de un contrato de compra y venta para hacer valer los efectos del mismo contra el que ha obquirido sobre ella ningun derecho real, ni algun gravamen, y solo tiene accion personal contra el anterior dueno para el cobro de un credito.<br\/><br\/>Es condicion legal de toda clase de embargo la de que la cosa embargada pertenezca al deudor. El tercero que protesta contra el embargo de sus bienes y formula se reclamacion con arreglo a la ley, tiene derecho a ser amparado o restituido en la posesion de los mismos, sin ser permitido que fuese despojado de ellos a no ser mediante el debido proceso de ley. (Decision en el asunto de Lopez contra Alvarez pag. 29 y en el de Ui Piaoco contra Osmena pag. 308 Tomo 9 de la j. F.)<br\/><br\/>Benito Carino segun el referido documento privado adquirio por compra con pacto de retro el terreno en cuestion y por haber trascurrido el ano para el retracto quedo dueno absoluto del terreno no por el adquirido y como el comprador o adquirente no esta obligado por ningun vinculo a favor del chino acreedor de esteban Ocerin anterior dueno y vendedor del expresado terreno, es insostenible el derecho alegado por el acreedor Chino Lim Quiongjui, por cuanto que este no ha adquirido por el embargo derecho real ni gravamen alguno sobre terreno, toda vez que solo tiene accion personal contra Esteban Ocerin para el cobro de su credito. (Decisiones en el asunto Guillermo contra Matienzo pag. 368, Fabian contra Smith Bell y Compania pag. 501, Tomo 8.o y Boncan contra Smith Bell y Peterson Sheriff de la Ciudad de Manila pag. 111, Tomo 9.o de la Jur. Fil.)<br\/><br\/>Por estas consideraciones en las que se estiman refutados los errores atribuidos a la sentencia apelada y no hallandose debidamente justificada la cuantia e importancia de los danos alegados por el demandante, procede la revocacion de la referida sentencia, se deciara que el terreno embargado y vendido al demandado chino Lim Quuionjui es de la exclusiva propiedad del demandante Benito Carino y se condena a dicho demandado a que lo restituya con las plantaciones en el sembradas a dicho demandante, sin especial pronunciamiento sobre las costas.<br\/><br\/>Trascurridos veinte dias desde la notificacion de esta decision dictese sentencia a tenor de lo resuelto, y diez dias despues devuelvanse los autos al Juzgado de su procedencia a los efectos oportunos.<br\/><br\/>Asi se ordena.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, Johnson, Moreland<\/i> y <i>Trent.<\/i> <\/div>",

THE INSULAR COLLECTOR OP CUSTOMS, RESPONDENT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TRENT, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">The admitted facts in this case are these:\u00a0 Victorino Lim Teco was born in Manila November 8, 1885, the legitimate son of Apolonio Lim Teco and Lucia Tiangco.\u00a0 Victorino was sent to China at the age of 5 and remained there until he returned to Manila on the steamer <i>Yingchow<\/i>, October 14, 1910, and sought admission as a citizen of the Philippine Islands.\u00a0 Apolonio Lim Teco, a Christian Chinese, died in Manila on October 22, 1900.\u00a0 His widow Lucia Tiangco is now living in the city of Manila.\u00a0 She was born in the Philippine Islands of a Chinese mestizo father and mother, who were likewise born here.\u00a0 Victorino, his seven brothers and sisters, and his father and mother, were all Christians and members of the Catholic church.\u00a0 His mother has never been outside the Philippine Islands.<br\/><br\/>Petitioner's right to enter the Philippine Islands as a citizen thereof was passed upon by a board of special inquiry and the board denied his right to enter upon two grounds:\u00a0 (1) Because his father was a subject of the Chinese Emperor on the 11th day of April, 1899, and his nationality followed that of his father; and (2) because the fact that he remained in China some five years after reaching his majority shows that he elected the nationality of that country and abandoned his right, if he had any, to citizenship here.\u00a0 The Court of First Instance of Manila, upon habeas corpus proceedings, ordered the petitioner discharged from custody.\u00a0 From this order the Collector of Customs appealed.<br\/><br\/>In the case of Tranquilino Roa (23 Phil. Rep., 315), we held that persons born of Chinese fathers and Filipina mothers within the Philippine Islands are citizens thereof, with certain well-recognized exceptions as stated in United States <i>vs<\/i>. Wong Kim Ark (169 U. S., 649).\u00a0 If, during minority they are taken to the country of their father's origin, they still remain citizens of the Philippine Islands.\u00a0 But in case the country of their father's origin claims them as citizens under the principle of <i>jus sanguinis<\/i>, such children are then considered as possessing a so-called dual nationality.<br\/><br\/>The laws of the several States with reference to the status of children born of foreign parents within the State are by no means uniform, and give rise to conflicting claims and difficulties of all sorts, at the present day when there is a large floating population of aliens in most countries.\u00a0 Some states, as the United States and England, claim all persons as citizens with the exceptions above noted-born within the state.\u00a0 Others, as Austria Hungary, Germany, and Switzerland, have adopted the rule that descent alone is the decisive factor, and claim the children of their nationals as citizens wherever born, recognizing the corresponding right of other nations to claim the children of their nationals born within the state.\u00a0 The result of the actual operation of both these rules as they are more or less modified by the different States, has brought forward the principle, recognized either tacitly or by express municipal law by all civilized nations, that a child born of an alien may choose on reaching its majority between the country of its birth and the country of its parents' birth.\u00a0 In the meanwhile, difficulties are generally avoided by the tacit consent of each nation to attempt no exercise of authority over such a person as long as he remains outside of its borders, and to make no objection to the exercise of\u00a0 authority over him by the other while he resides within its limits.\u00a0 (Lawrence, Int. L,, par. 94; Taylor, Id., par. 177; Hall, Id., par. 68; Wilson &amp; Tucker, Id., par. 50.)\u00a0 The right of election is recognized in the United States.\u00a0 (Moore, Int. L. Dig., par. 430.)\u00a0 There is no law in the United States regulating the time within which this right of election must be exercised after the child has attained its majority.<br\/><br\/>It follows from\u00a0 the foregoing that the appellee was a citizen by birth of the Philippine Islands, and that, due to the fact of his foreign parentage, the obligation of election devolved upon him upon attaining his majority.\u00a0 The domicile of his father and after the latter's death that of his mother and his two brothers and one sister who are still living was and has been in the Philippine Islands.\u00a0 Until he became of age, the appellee's legal right to claim a domicile within the Philippine Islands cannot be denied.\u00a0 The question is thus narrowed down to what the appellee did from the date of his majority until he returned to the Philippine Islands in October, 1910, a period of about five years, indicative of his selection of a permanent domicile.<br\/><br\/>By the Act of 1868, the Congress of the United States definitely declared that expatriation could be accomplished.\u00a0 But until the passage of the Act of March 2, 1907 (34 Stat. at L., 1228) Congress did not provide for any method by which this could be done.\u00a0 It was therefore necessary for the executive and judicial branches of the Government to decide whether expatriation was an accomplished fact as each individual case was presented.\u00a0 Several principles were gradually settled upon by these departments by which to determine this question with some degree of uniformity, and these principles were given definite and authoritative form by their embodiment in the Act of 1907, <i>supra<\/i>.\u00a0 By section 2 of that Act it is provided that any American expatriates himself by becoming a naturalized citizen of another country, or by taking the oath of allegiance to another country; and that any naturalized citizen of the United States shall be presumed to have expatriated himself by a residence of two years in the state from whence he came or of five years in any other state, this presumption to be overcome by satisfactory evidence.\u00a0 By section 6, all children born outside the United States who are citizens by virtue of their fathers' being citizens of that country must, if they continue to reside outside the United States, indicate their desire to retain their American citizenship at the age of 18, and upon attaining their majority must take the oath of allegiance to the United States.\u00a0 It will be noted that this last section recognizes the principle of the right of selection.\u00a0 But it\u00a0 does not cover those cases where, as in the case at bar, the child has acquired citizenship by reason of birth within the jurisdiction of the State, and who removes to the country of his father's origin during minority.<br\/><br\/>Such cases do, however, on the one hand bear some resemblance to the case of a naturalized citizen who returns to his native country, and on the other hand to the case of the child born a citizen without the United States.\u00a0 In the first place, the environment of a,child up to the age of 5 has little, if any, permanent influence upon his subsequent life if taken to another and very different environment.\u00a0 And a child born of an alien father, taken to his father's country at that age, and remaining there until he attains his majority, is, for all practical purposes, as much a resident of the latter country as a native born who has never left it.\u00a0 Little trace of his foreign birth and residence is left upon such a child after a residence of several years in his father's country.\u00a0 He lapses into the manner of the native born as easily and as effectually as his father who sired him during a residence of a number of years in a foreign land.\u00a0 Again, having ceased to regard the country of his birth as his home, he is practically in the same position as an American citizen who has never lived in the United States, and who is referred to in section 6 of the Act of 1907, <i>supra.<\/i><br\/><br\/>It follows, therefore, that a child born of alien parents who goes to his father's native land at a tender age and remains there during\u00a0 minority, on becoming of age should, if he desires to retain his Filipino citizenship, indicate that desire by exercising his right of election; and a failure to express such a desire within a reasonable time should be regarded as a strong presumption of his purpose to become definitely identified with the body politic of his father's country.\u00a0 The length of time within which this right must be exercised, as stated above, has never been the subject of legislation.\u00a0 The State Department of the United States has, however, repeatedly held that such election must be made within a reasonable time and is best evidenced by an early return to the country of his birth.\u00a0 In fact, the decisions of the Department of State have gone further and have held almost uniformly that a return to the country of the child's birth at an early date after attaining majority is absolutely essential for him to retain citizenship therein.<br\/><blockquote>\"It has further been repeatedly held by us, as you are aware, that when a person thus born in the United States arrives at 21 in a foreign country, the mode of expressing his election to be a citizen of the United States is be promptly returning to the United States.\u00a0 The same distinction is applied to children born abroad to the citizens of the United States.\u00a0 There is, in both these cases, what is called double allegiance; and by the law of nations the nationality of such persons is to be determined by their own election of nationality at their majority, which election is evidenced by placing themselves in the country they elect.\u00a0 Should such persons after electing the United States, and here taking up their domicile, go to France for a transient visit, it will be your duty to\u00a0 protect them as citizens of the United States.\"\u00a0 (Mr. Bayard, Sec. of State, to Mr. McLane, Min. to, France, Feb. 15, 1888, For. Rel. 1888, I, 510, 511.)<\/blockquote>It will be noted that the State Department's ruling as to children born abroad to citizens of the United States, in so far as a prompt return to the United States is required, is modified by section 6 of the Act of 1907, <i>supra<\/i>, so that such children may exercise their right\u00a0 of election by taking the oath of allegiance upon attaining majority, the return to the United States no longer being required.\u00a0 But as no legislation has been promulgated regarding children born within the United States of foreign parents, we must hold that the ruling of the State Department requiring an early return to the country remains, to that extent, unchanged.<br\/><br\/>Cases could readily be conceived where circumstances prevented the child from returning to the country of his birth immediately after\u00a0 attaining majority, and in such cases, upon a proper showing, the return at an early date would, no doubt, be waived, so far as the exigencies of the case required. No such claims have however, been made in the case at the bar, and the board of special inquiry having found as a fact that the appellee by his conduct had\u00a0 expatriated himself, we cannot entertain the idea that the appellee may, after a residence, under these circumstances, of five years in his father's native country after\u00a0 attaining majority, now elect to become a citizen of the Philippine Islands.\u00a0\u00a0 He has irrevocably lost that right by his failure to exercise it within a reasonable time after becoming of age.\u00a0 He is no longer a citizen of the Philippine Islands.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is reversed and appellee ordered returned to the custody of the Collector of Customs.\u00a0 Without costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C, J., Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson<\/i>, and <i>Moreland, JJ<\/i>., concur. <\/div>",
