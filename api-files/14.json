It is conceded in effect, however, that if the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution is true the defendant is guilty.\u00a0 That he is guilty if the\u00a0 witnesses of the Government are to be believed is beyond\u00a0 possibility of doubt.\u00a0 The real question resolves itself ultimately, then,\u00a0 into the question\u00a0 of the credibility of the witnesses.\u00a0 We have said in a recent case that where there is\u00a0 a conflict in the testimony of witnesses the peculiar province\u00a0 of the trial court is to resolve the question of credibility, and, unless there is something in the record impeaching by fair interpretation the resolution of the trial court in relation to that question, this court will assume that he acted\u00a0 fairly, justly, and\u00a0 legally in the exercise of that function.\u00a0 We have read the evidence adduced on the trial with great care.\u00a0\u00a0 The testimony of the witnesses CasteJIanes, Baquiran,\u00a0 Bienvenido Duarte, Anacleto Duarte, Magas, Balayan, Claravall, Banta, Bayad, and Bugenio, produced by the prosecution, is clear, direct, unequivocal, and powerful, disclosing no elements of untruth. Their probative force is overwhelming.\u00a0 They support in the very clearest and most forcible manner the findings of the trial court.<br\/><br\/>We have only one criticism of\u00a0 the judgment below.\u00a0\u00a0 We are convinced that the court, in imposing the penalty, should have taken into consideration in favor of the\u00a0 accused the extenuating circumstance described in article 9, subdivision 3, of the Penal\u00a0 Code, namely, that \"the delinquent had no intention of committing so grave an injury\u00a0 as that which he inflicted.\"\u00a0 There not having been present any aggravating circumstance, the penalty should have been imposed in its minimum degree.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below is hereby modified, and the defendant is hereby sentenced to seventeen years four months\u00a0 and one day\u00a0 of cadena temporal, to the accessories provided by law, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of Pl,000, and to pay the\u00a0 costs of the trial.\u00a0 So modified the\u00a0 judgment is affirmed,\u00a0 with\u00a0 the\u00a0 costs of this instance against the\u00a0 appellant.<br\/><br\/>The defendant makes a motion for a new trial, alleging the discovery of new\u00a0 and material evidence which could not have been discovered before the trial in the court below by the exercise of reasonable\u00a0 diligence and which is of such a character as probably to change the\u00a0 result.\u00a0\u00a0 In support of his motion he presents his own affidavit and the affidavits of Hermogenes Ramos and Maria del Pilar.\u00a0 In his statement Ramos\u00a0 swears\u00a0 that on the night\u00a0 in question he was riding a carabao upon the road along which the Chinaman, Go-Siengco, was being conducted from\u00a0 the house of Castellanes to that of the accused; that the Chinaman walked well; that he\u00a0 saw Balayan, the deaf-mute, a witness for the prosecution, suddenly strike the Chinaman three heavy blows with the butt\u00a0 of a gun, on receiving which the Chinaman fell to the\u00a0 ground; that Balayan picked him\u00a0 up and they passed on toward defendant's house; that affiant approached closer and\u00a0 Balayan told him that he had struck the Chinaman three blows with his gun; that soon thereafter Balayan again struck the Chinaman in the right side with his gun, causing\u00a0 the Chinaman to cry out with\u00a0 pain; that the next morning Balayan told him that\u00a0 the\u00a0 Chinaman was dead, having\u00a0 succumbed\u00a0 to the blows\u00a0 which he had\u00a0 given him the\u00a0 night before.\u00a0 Maria del Pilar\u00a0 states in\u00a0 her affidavit that she is the mother of Balayan and\u00a0 that she heard him tell\u00a0 the\u00a0 wife of the accused after the trial, in response to the\u00a0 question why he had sworn against\u00a0 her husband at the hearing\u00a0 of the cause,\u00a0 that he had\u00a0 sworn\u00a0 against the accused for\u00a0 fear of some Chinamen and\u00a0 the\u00a0 sergeant of police of Ilagan, who told him that they would shoot him and hang him unless\u00a0 he so testified.<br\/><br\/>We do not believe that the motion for a new trial ought in justice to be granted.\u00a0 It has been held by this court that a new trial will not be granted \"unless the following conditions exist:\u00a0 (1) The evidence must have been\u00a0 discovered since the trial;\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 it must\u00a0 be\u00a0 such that with\u00a0 the\u00a0 use of reasonable diligence on the part of the defendant it could not have been secured on the former trial;\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 it must be material and not\u00a0 merely\u00a0 collateral\u00a0 or\u00a0 cumulative or corroborative or impeaching;\u00a0 (4) it must be such as ought to produce a different result\u00a0 on\u00a0 the merits on another trial; (5)\u00a0 it must go to the merits,\u00a0 and\u00a0 not rest\u00a0 on a merely technical defense.\"\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs.<\/i>\u00a0 Luzon,\u00a0 4\u00a0 Phil. Rep., 343.)<br\/><br\/>In the case at bar it was fully known\u00a0 to the defendant that Hermogenes\u00a0 Ramos was a very material and important witness since\u00a0 he was one of those, according to the defendant's own proof, who accompanied the Chinaman from the house of Castellanes to that of the accused.\u00a0\u00a0 No effort whatever was made by the defendant to secure the attendance of this man as a witness on the trial.\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover the evidence which the defendant offers to present on the occasion of a new trial is contradictory in\u00a0 the extreme\u00a0 to the evidence which he actually presented on trial at which he was convicted.\u00a0 There it\u00a0 was contended\u00a0 stoutly, and evidence was adduced by him to support that contention, that the Chinaman was not assaulted or struck by any person in any way from the\u00a0 time he left the house of Castellanes until he reached that of\u00a0 the accused.\u00a0 In corroboration of this the defense presented\u00a0 evidence tending to show that the Chinaman died a natural and not a violent death.\u00a0 In addition, while Hermogenes, in his\u00a0 affidavit,\u00a0 states that he\u00a0 joined those who were conducting the\u00a0 Chinaman only\u00a0 after they had progressed a\u00a0 considerable distance on the way\u00a0 to the house of the accused, having inadvertently come upon them while he, mounted upon a carabao, was traveling upon his own affairs, nevertheless it appears from the testimony of defendant's\u00a0 witness on the trial that he, Hermogenes, was present as one of\u00a0 the companions of the accused from the time he left the <i>casa-hacienda<\/i> search of several <i>malhechores<\/i> until he returned there with one lone Chinaman roughly dragged from peaceful slumber.<br\/><br\/>The motion for a new trial is denied.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

He was the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">muchacho<\/span> of Lieutenant Prueyn, of the United States Army.\u00a0\u00a0 The house where the robbery occurred was occupied by Lieutenant Prueyn and Captain Taylor, with their <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">muchachos,\u00a0<\/span> who were the defendant\u00a0 and another. Lieutenant Prueyn on the 4th day of December, 1908, had in his possession\u00a0 certain funds of his company,\u00a0 which, together with money and jewelry of his own, was on said date kept in a\u00a0 strong box in the house aforesaid.\u00a0 On the night of said December 4th, at about 12 o'clock, said strong box\u00a0 was found broken open and the money and jewelry gone.\u00a0 It was\u00a0 conclusively\u00a0 proved on the\u00a0 trial that\u00a0 the box\u00a0 had been\u00a0 opened by means\u00a0 of a\u00a0 hatchet which was kept in the house.\u00a0\u00a0 The marks upon said box corresponded with\u00a0 the size of the hatchet's edge\u00a0 and\u00a0 the hatchet upon being examined was found stained with the red paint with which a portion\u00a0 of said\u00a0 strong\u00a0 box was\u00a0 covered at\u00a0 the time it was forcibly opened.<br\/><br\/>The defendant was\u00a0 convicted upon\u00a0 circumstantial evidence.\u00a0 No one saw the crime committed and none of the property has\u00a0 been discovered.\u00a0 The following\u00a0 facts and circumstances were used by the court below to convict the defendant:<br\/><br\/>Lieutenant Prueyn left the house on\u00a0 the afternoon\u00a0 of the 4th of December at 5 o'clock and did not return until about\u00a0 12 o'clock of the same night.\u00a0 When he left\u00a0 the house the strong box was securely locked\u00a0 and he carried with\u00a0 him the only key thereto.\u00a0 Only four persons lived in the house - Lieutenant Prueyn,\u00a0 Captain\u00a0 Taylor, the defendant <i>muchacho <\/i>of Lieutenant Prueyn, and Agaton, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">muchacho<\/span> of Captain Taylor.\u00a0 These two <i>muchachos<\/i> did\u00a0 not ordinarily remain in\u00a0 the house at night, but at the end of each day, after serving at supper at the residence of the colonel of the regiment, went to their respective homes to pass the night. Before\u00a0 leaving the house on the day in question Lieutenant Prueyn\u00a0 had\u00a0 sent\u00a0 the\u00a0 accused to\u00a0 the village after a horse.<br\/><br\/>On the morning after the robbery the accused did\u00a0 not return to the house at the usual time, but remained away until\u00a0 9 o'clock.\u00a0 On arriving at the house he appeared to Lieutenant Prueyn to be very nervous and on entering his room told\u00a0 him that the box had been broken\u00a0 open and that he was very much afraid.\u00a0 Upon being questioned by the lieutenant as to when he\u00a0 returned\u00a0 from the village where he had been sent for the horse, he stated first that he had returned at\u00a0 7.30 o'clock,\u00a0 then\u00a0 at 7 o'clock, and then at 6 o'clock, and then at 6.30 o'clock.\u00a0 Ordinarily the accused did not\u00a0 appear nervous nor did\u00a0 he prior to the robbery appear to be of a nervous temperament.<br\/><br\/>The accused knew that the\u00a0 box contained money and jewelry, as\u00a0 he had many times seen Lieutenant Prueyn open it and\u00a0 take out considerable\u00a0 sums of money and had seen\u00a0 him close it up, leaving large sums of money and valuable jewelry\u00a0 therein.\u00a0 The hatchet with which the box was forced\u00a0 was the one usually kept in\u00a0 the house for the ordinary uses of the occupants, particularly the\u00a0 servants, and was always\u00a0 kept in\u00a0 a\u00a0 particular place\u00a0 in the house. So far as appears from the evidence, nobody knew where the hatchet was kept in the house except the two occupants and their <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">muchachos,<\/span> one of whom\u00a0 was the accused.\u00a0 After the robbery the hatchet was found\u00a0 in its ordinary place in the room where\u00a0 it was\u00a0 usually kept.\u00a0 Immediately after the discovery of the robbery Captain Taylor and\u00a0 Lieutenant\u00a0 Prueyn, observing that the box\u00a0 had been opened with\u00a0 an instrument resembling a hatchet,\u00a0 got the hatchet and discovered that it had upon its blade and nose marks of the red paint\u00a0 with which the strong box was covered. They\u00a0 observed also that the marks and indentures\u00a0 made upon\u00a0 the box were closely fitted by the various\u00a0 portions of the hatchet.\u00a0 Prior to the commission of the robbery no such paint marks had been observed upon\u00a0 the hatchet.<br\/><br\/>It was the custom of Captain\u00a0 Taylor and Lieutenant Prueyn to leave the house at\u00a0 about 6 o'clock to go to the colonel's apartments for their\u00a0 supper.\u00a0 Sometimes Agaton closed the house;\u00a0 sometimes the accused.\u00a0\u00a0 Ordinarily after having served supper the servants, including the accused, did not return to\u00a0 the house but went directly to their own homes.\u00a0 The proofs show that\u00a0 the servants never returned to the house without orders.\u00a0\u00a0 Upon the night of the robbery there\u00a0 was no order to the servants to return to the house.<br\/><br\/>The accused knew that Lieutenant Prueyn was going for a walk on this particular night, and he also knew that when he did go for a walk he was usually away about three hours. When not taking his walk the lieutenant was usually absent from the house from one and one-half\u00a0 to three hours. Prior to the robbery the lieutenant had missed from his pocket a P20 bill.\u00a0 This was the only time any of his property had disappeared.\u00a0 The accused usually borrowed money of the lieutenant during the\u00a0 month in anticipation of his salary.<br\/><br\/>Captain\u00a0 Taylor left the house\u00a0 on the\u00a0 afternoon of the robbery at about 6 o'clock to get his\u00a0 supper at the colonel's. Ordinarily Agaton, who served at the colonel's table, left the lieutenant's house at about 6 o'clock or a little before, while the accused remained at the house until a little later, when he too went to assist with the supper at the colonel's house.\u00a0 On\u00a0 the night of the robbery Captain Taylor arrived at the colonel's house at about 6.30 o'clock and found there Agaton, whom he saw there\u00a0 until a little after 7.\u00a0 When he left the lieutenant's house at about 6 o'clock Agaton had already gone, but there still remained in the house another person,\u00a0 who, while not seen by the\u00a0 captain, was taken by him to\u00a0 be the defendant.\u00a0 The captain returned from his supper\u00a0 to the\u00a0 lieutenant's house\u00a0 at about 7 o'clock.\u00a0 On arriving there he found the accused.\u00a0 It was not\u00a0 usual or customary for the accused to be there at that time of night. The captain seated himself at a table to read.\u00a0 While so seated the\u00a0 accused two or\u00a0 three\u00a0 times entered the\u00a0 room in which the hatchet\u00a0 was kept and passed several times through the room in\u00a0 which the captain was seated, going from one thing to another\u00a0 in the room and appearing to be very nervous.\u00a0 The conduct of the accused being very unusual, the captain\u00a0 ceased\u00a0 reading and\u00a0 observed him, whereupon\u00a0 the\u00a0 accused, noticing that he\u00a0 was observed, stopped\u00a0 and asked him when Lieutenant\u00a0 Prueyn\u00a0 would return.\u00a0 The captain replied that he did not know.\u00a0 The captain remained at the house until twenty minutes past 9, when he went to the house next to the one occupied by him,\u00a0 located\u00a0 about 30 or 35 yards therefrom, returning before 10.\u00a0 While at that house he would have been able to hear very easily the sounds which would necessarily have been made in forcing open the strong box in the manner in which it was found to have been opened.\u00a0 He heard no such sounds while there.\u00a0 He returned to the lieutenant's house before\u00a0 10.\u00a0 At 11 o'clock he went to bed.\u00a0 While in the room he was about 24 feet from the strong box.\u00a0 He was thus in a position from 7 o'clock until the discovery of the robbery where he would undoubtedly have heard the noise\u00a0 which would necessarily have been made in opening the box.\u00a0 He\u00a0 heard no\u00a0 such noise.\u00a0 The robbery,\u00a0 then, must\u00a0 have been committed before 7 o'clock.\u00a0 The accused was at the house from 6 to 7.<br\/><br\/>The servant Agaton was continuously at the lieutenant's house until 6 o'clock, when he went to the colonel's house to prepare supper.\u00a0\u00a0 When he left\u00a0 the\u00a0 house the accused was still there.\u00a0 Captain\u00a0 Taylor was\u00a0 also there.

These\u00a0 facts were averred by\u00a0 the widow and two other witnesses.\u00a0 The widow\u00a0 moreover testified that there was no issue by her marriage with Marigsa,\u00a0 and that she\u00a0 no longer had any ascendants, nor knew of any\u00a0 collateral relative of her deceased husband; that the plaintiff himself was named Marigsa only\u00a0 as a nickname,\u00a0 his father's family name being Magcauayan, and that the\u00a0 carabaos had been registered in the name\u00a0 of Esteban Marigsa because the latter was her husband.<br\/><br\/>The Court of First Instance\u00a0 of Nueva Ecija, in accordance with the petition appearing in the complaint, declared that\u00a0 the six animals specified therein belonged\u00a0 exclusively to the intestate estate of Esteban Marigsa and were subject to the plaintiff's administration, and ordered the defendants to return them to Narciso Marigsa as such administrator. The court also declared rescinded and\u00a0 invalid the\u00a0 sales made by the defendant, Ildefonsa Macabuntoc, to her codefendants, with one-sixth of the costs of the trial against each of the defendants.\u00a0 The latter appealed from the said judgment and alleged the following assignments of error:<br\/><br\/>First. That the court found that the plaintiff had\u00a0 fully proved the allegations of his complaint\u00a0 by means\u00a0 of the certificates\u00a0 of ownership issued by\u00a0 the municipality\u00a0 of Cuyapo.<br\/><br\/>Second. That the court found that the carabaos sued for belonged\u00a0 exclusively\u00a0 to\u00a0 the intestate Esteban Marigsa, formed a part of his estate\u00a0 under administration, and adudged their return to the defendants; and<br\/><br\/>Third. That the court declared the sales made by the defendant, Ildefonsa llacabuntoc, to her codefendants to be rescinded and invalid.<br\/><br\/>This court has already decided that the initiation of intestate proceedings must not disturb the\u00a0 possession, either of the surviving\u00a0 spouse, or\u00a0 of the legitimate\u00a0 heirs, much less that of a third party.<br\/><br\/>In the registration of animals belonging to husband and wife, the record thereof is often made\u00a0 out only in the name of the husband, on account\u00a0 of his being the administrator of the conjugal partnership;\u00a0 so that the registration herein concerned is not conclusive evidence of the exclusive ownership of the husband.\u00a0\u00a0 Other kind of proof\u00a0 is necessary to destroy the presumption implied by\u00a0 article 1407 of the Civil Code, which\u00a0 provides;<br\/><blockquote>\"All the property of the marriage shall be considered\u00a0 as partnership property until it is proven that it belongs exclusively to the husband or to the wife.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Although the property appears as registered\u00a0 in the name of the\u00a0 husband, if it was acquired for a valuable consideration during the marriage it\u00a0 has\u00a0 the inherent character\u00a0 of partnership property, whether the acquisition\u00a0 is made for the partnership or for one of the spouses only.\u00a0 (Art. 1401, par. 1, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>The marriage of Marigsa with Macabuntoc having lasted for more than thirty years, according to the testimony, and some of the\u00a0 carabaos being the offspring of others which were purchased, as stated\u00a0 by the defendant, during\u00a0 the marriage, such animals are not paraphernal property of the widow, as she claims, for even such offspring is considered as community\u00a0 property, according to paragraph\u00a0 3 of\u00a0 the said article 1401; nor were they the private property of the deceased husband.<br\/><br\/>The community property of the marriage, at the dissolution of this bond by the death of one of the spouses, ceases to belong to the legal partnership and becomes the property of a\u00a0 community, by operation\u00a0 of law, between the\u00a0 surviving spouse and the heirs of the deceased Espouse, or the exclusive property of the widower or the widow if he or she be\u00a0 the heir of the deceased spouse.\u00a0\u00a0 In the present suit, no proof was adduced to show what right the plaintiff has to call himself coowner with the defendant widow, the only action which could appertain to him\u00a0 in order that he might interfere with the acts of a person who, in the exercise of her rights with respect to property of which she is a coowner, or perhaps an absolute owner, disposed of such property by transferring\u00a0 the\u00a0 same, without the need therefor of\u00a0 any authorization whatever.\u00a0 Although it were\u00a0 upon no other basis than that of coownership, which coownership is irrefutably shown to have existed by the\u00a0 evidence in this case, the surviving widow\u00a0 acted perfectly\u00a0 within\u00a0 her\u00a0 rights in transferring the property in question.\u00a0 Whenever\u00a0 it shall be shown that there is another coowner as the hem of the deceased husband, then there will\u00a0 be occasion to prosecute an action for the annulment\u00a0 of the sale with respect to one-half of\u00a0 the said property; in\u00a0 order that it may be inventoried as belonging to the testate or intestate succession of the predecessor in interest.<br\/><blockquote>\"ART.\u00a0 399. Every coowner shall have full\u00a0 ownership of his part and in the fruits and benefits derived therefrom, and he therefore may alienate, assign, or mortgage it, and even substitute another\u00a0 person\u00a0 in its\u00a0 enjoyment, unless personal rights are in question.\u00a0 But the effect of the alienation or mortgage, with regard to the coowners, shall be limited to the share which may be awarded him in the division on\u00a0 the dissolution\u00a0 of\u00a0 the community.\"\u00a0 (Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>\"SEC. 685. <i>Community Property.<\/i> - One-half the\u00a0 community property,\u00a0 as determined by the law in force in the Philippine Islands before the thirteenth\u00a0 day of\u00a0 August, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, belonging to a husband and wife, shall be deemed to belong to the deceased husband or wife, and shall be inventoried\u00a0 and accounted for, and distributed as a part of the estate, in the same manner as all other property belonging to the estate.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Code of Civil Procedure.)<\/blockquote>From the preceding premises it is concluded:<br\/><br\/>First. That sufficient grounds\u00a0 have not been\u00a0 shown in this\u00a0 suit to adjudge that the property in question was the private property of the deceased spouse, as against the legal presumption\u00a0 that it was\u00a0 the\u00a0 community property\u00a0 of both spouses; and, consequently, the first part\u00a0 of the first finding of the judgment appealed from, declaring it to be\u00a0 such,\u00a0 is improper and should be reversed.<br\/><br\/>Second. That the second finding\u00a0 of the said judgment\u00a0 is premature, in so far as it declares the sales made by the defendant, Ildefonsa Macabuntoc, to be\u00a0 rescinded\u00a0 and invalid, as this could be done only after it had been proven, in a proper action, that there is another coowner as heir of the deceased husband\u00a0 of the vendor;\u00a0 and,\u00a0 consequently, this finding also should be reversed.<br\/><br\/>Third. That the second part of the first finding, in so far as it declares all the animals\u00a0 claimed to be subject to the intestate estate of Esteban Marigsa, is likewise improper, inasmuch\u00a0 as, by virtue of the legal presumption that has until now prevailed,\u00a0 only a one-half\u00a0 interest that might have pertained to the deceased husband in the said property, presumptively the\u00a0 community\u00a0 property of the dissolved marriage, can, in\u00a0 principle, be considered as subject thereto, until proof to the contrary be adduced.\u00a0\u00a0 Consequently, this finding must also\u00a0 be disapproved.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is reversed, without\u00a0 special finding as to costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Johnson,\u00a0 Carson, <\/i>and <i>Moreland, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><\/div>",

That, under No. 1869, a case was tried in the Court of First Instance of Manila concerning the testate estate of Antonio Enriquez and the intestate estate of Ciriaca Villanueva.<br\/><br\/>Second. That in the said estates defendants appear as heirs to the property left by the said spouses at their death.<br\/><br\/>Third. That the plaintiff held a claim against the said estates amounting to 10,557 francs, or their equivalent in Philippine currency, which was allowed and ordered paid by the court on August 26, 1905.<br\/><br\/>Fourth. That the administrator of the estates did not immediately pay the said debt, alleging that at the time he did not have the necessary cash, but that he would get the money to liquidate the debt as soon as possible, which, up to the present time, he has not done.<br\/><br\/>Fifth. That on the 2d of January, 1906, the heirs of the spouses Enriquez and Villanueva executed ,an instrument of partition of property, which appears in the record of the said case No. 1869 and was approved by the court on January 25, 1906; that by virtue of the instrument aforesaid, the proceedings in case No. 1869 above mentioned were concluded without the plaintiff's knowledge.<br\/><br\/>Sixth. That as a result of the proceedings in the said case, without previous payment to the plaintiff, who is a recognized creditor in the suit, the plaintiff is obliged to file this complaint praying for the rescission of the partition of the property of the deceased spouses Enriquez and Villanueva, unless their heirs give a sufficient and proper bond to secure the payment of his claim.<br\/><br\/>Seventh. That the plaintiff suffers great detriment by this delay in the payment already authorized by the Court of First Instance, and by having to file the new complaint.<br\/><br\/>On the grounds hereinbefore related, the plaintiff prays that judgment be rendered against the defendants for the sum of 10,557 francs, or their equivalent in Philippine currency, with legal interest thereon, and the costs, and that the partition already made between the heirs be annulled, unless they give bond to secure the payment of the amount claimed.<br\/><br\/>The defendants Francisco Enriquez and Carmen de la Cavada de Enriquez denied in their answer, among other alleged facts, that contained in paragraph 3 of the complaint, and alleged expressly that the debt therein claimed was contracted solely and exclusively by their codefendant Rafael Enriquez for the latter's use and exclusive benefit and that such liability was incurred long after the death of their predecessors in interest, Francisco Enriquez and Ciriaca Villanueva. They further set up, as a special defense, the agreement made in the instrument of partition of the property left by their said predecessors, executed on January 2, 1906, in clause 9 of which their coheirs and codefendants in the present cause state, textually, that they \"release the aforementioned Don Francisco Enriquez and his wife, Dona Carmen de la Cavada, from all obligation by reason of any hereditary or testamentary debt, inasmuch as they, the said codefendants and coheirs, do take upon themselves the payment of all the debts and obligations of both estates, with the exception of the mortgage of P7,500, and interest, on the property situated at No. 42 Calle David, the payment of which is assumed by the said Francisco Enriquez and his wife, the other heirs being relieved and released from this mortgage obligation.\" The partition and the agreement above mentioned were judicially approved.<br\/><br\/>The other defendants confined themselves to a denial of the last clause of paragraph 5 and the first clause of paragraph 6 of the complaint, without denying either generally or specifically the other facts alleged therein which, therefore, must be deemed to have been admitted by them, in accordance with the provisions of section 94 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br\/><br\/>The trial having been conducted with all its necessary proceedings, the defendants were acquitted with the costs against the plaintiff, who appealed from the judgment to this court.<br\/><br\/>It is declared as approved in the judgment appealed from, without such declaration having been impugned in the present instance, that the administrator of the testate estate of Antonio Lopez (it must be Enriquez), in his quality as such, bound himself to pay the credit herein claimed to the attorney for the plaintiff, and that the judge authorized the payment of the same in the special administration proceedings. The order authorizing the said payment recognizes, according to the judgment, that the claim mentioned in favor of the plaintiff is a debt contracted by the estate. This being granted, it follows as a necessary and inevitable consequence that it should be paid out of the property of the estate itself.<br\/><br\/>It is no bar to this conclusion that the said debt was contracted many years after the death of the testator Enriquez, because this circumstance in itself alone does not show that it was not done in the interest of the estate, to attend the needs and meet the obligations of which it is very possible that the debt was contracted. No precise and specific data appear in the record of the trial which sufficiently support the allegation that it was contracted solely for the personal and exclusive benefit of one of the defendants; on the contrary, there is other data of much importance which tends directly to connect the said debt with the estate in question. It is insinuated in the testimony of one witness that the credit claimed in the complaint originated from advances made by the plaintiff as a pension that had to be paid to one of the heirs of the administrator of the estate. It also appears to be indicated that a part of these advances was paid, without opposition by the heirs, out of funds pertaining to the estate; and, finally, the present administrator of the same, in testifying with regard to some letters wherein reference is made to plaintiff's credit, stated that \"they must be among the administrator's accounts which should be united with the records of the cause in this court, as vouchers showing the fulfillment of his duty.\" If the debt in question was not properly one chargeable against the estate, neither would a part of it have been paid out of funds of the estate, nor would there be any reason for including the documents relative thereto among the administrator's accounts, with which, on such a supposition, they would have absolutely no concern whatever.<br\/><br\/>But this is not the true aspect of the question.\u00a0 Our point of view is that there exists an order, assented to and final, which recognized and declared that the debt, the subject of the complaint, was a debt contracted by the estate, and in consequence thereof ordered the payment of the same by the administrator of the estate, in the special proceedings had with reference thereto. No appeal having been taken at any time against the order mentioned, there is no reason for incidentally discussing herein either the legality of the same, or, consequently, the nature of the said debt already defined in a conclusive manner in the order itself which, on account of such failure to appeal, has become final and irrevocable in accordance with law. The authority of the matter thus adjudged makes all further discussion on these points entirely irrelevant and improper.<br\/><br\/>The complaint is directed against the heirs individually, upon the allegation that the partition of the estate left by Antonio Enriquez and Ciriaca Villanueva, the predecessors in interest of the said heirs, has already been made and judicially approved. The judgment appealed from relates, with regard to this point: First, that if the estate is actually liable for the debt herein claimed, collection thereof should be undertaken in the special administration proceedings concerning the said estate, which are not yet entirely terminated, as some houses belonging to the estate are still in litigation; and, second, that a sufficient reason has not been adduced for making the heirs individually liable for the debt in question.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the first conclusion, it is found to be sufficiently proven that the division of the estate, as alleged in the complaint, was actually made. The defendants themselves admit it as true in their respective written answers, and only deny that, by virtue of such division, the proceedings in the settlement of the testate estate of Antonio Enriquez and of the intestate estate of Ciriaca Villanueva were considered as terminated, without the <i>knowledge of the plaintiff<\/i>, as also alleged in the complaint. So certain it is that the partition was made that the defendants Francisco Enriquez and Carmen de la Cavada base one of their defenses on the instrument of partition <i>of the property of both estates, then not in litigation,<\/i> * * * as they say textually. And, in conformity with this, the administrator of the said estates testified at the trial that the property which had not yet been divided among the heirs consisted of buildings that were then in litigation, a litigation which in the first instance resulted adversely to the within defendants, as stated, and without contradiction, in appellant's brief. And if all the estate was divided, with the exception of those houses in litigation, it is evident that there is now nothing more to divide among the heirs, for what is subject to the eventualities and contingencies of a lawsuit can not at the present day be deemed to be actual property of the estate. This being the case, one should not, nor can one oblige the creditor or creditors of the estate to await the result, which may well be unfavorable, of such litigation, in order to realize upon his or their claim, as by virtue of the partition the heirs have in their possession the property derived from the estate. The right of the creditors to collect is one which has preference over that of the heirs to inherit, in view of the well-known fact that the inheritance consists only of what remains after the payment and settlement of all the debts and liabilities outstanding against the entire hereditary assets.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the second conclusion, the theory of the lower court would be correct, were it a question of an inheritance in the state of administration. Under such circumstances the heir can not personally be sued for either hereditary or testimentary debts, nor for those of administration, which may lie against the estate, the legal representation of which is assumed entirely by the executor or administrator. This, briefly, is the doctrine that is deduced, in so far as this point is concerned, from the judgment rendered in the case of Pavia <i>vs.<\/i> De la Rosa (8 Phil. Rep., 70), cited in the judgment appealed from. But such is not the present case.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Here, the estate has already been divided and the property belonging thereto is in the possession of the heirs. The judicial administration has been practically terminated, for if it still subsists it is, apparently, for the sole purpose of enabling a continuance and maintenance of some pending suits, its purposes having come to an end with respect to the totality of the divisible and cash assets from the succession which, in fact and by law, have passed to the control and personal and exclusive administration of the heirs by virtue of the partition. Because of this circumstance, and because the legality of the plaintiff's credit has been judicially recognized and the payment of the same ordered in the special proceedings for the administration of the testate and intestate estates of the predecessors in interest of the said defendants, we believe that the provisions of section 731 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the caption of which is <i>\"Devisees, legatees, and heirs, in possession, must contribute\" are applicable to the present case. It is provided in the text of this section that the persons who, as heirs, have received the estate not disposed of by will, shall be liable to contribute like the devisees or legatees <\/i>to the payment of the debts and expenses, etc. Substantially identical with this provision is that contained in section 749 of the same code in reference to contingent claims, wherein it is provided that \"* * * the assets so distributed shall still remain subject to the liability of the claim when established, and the creditor may maintain an action against the distributees to recover his debt, and such distributees and their estates shall be liable for such debts in proportion to the estate they have respectively received from the property of the deceased.\"<br\/><br\/>According to the spirit of these provisions, after the partition has been made, the heirs become liable individually, in proportion to the hereditary share received by each of them, for the payment of the debts the legality of which has been duly and properly recognized, such as the claim of the plaintiff, and which when the partition was made may have remained yet unpaid. This avoids the necessity of annulling the partition and restoring the succession to the state of administration, as requested in the complaint, which undoubtedly would be much more expensive and detrimental to the heirs; by applying the legal provision above cited the same result is obtained without the outlays and expenses of a new administration.<br\/><br\/>The proportionate liability of the heirs, as before stated, must be understood to be limited to the part of the hereditary assets that each shall have received or to the value thereof, for, in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, \"it is understood that a testate or intestate succession of a deceased person is always accepted and received with benefit of inventory, and his heirs, even after having taken possession of the estate of the deceased, do not make themselves responsible for the debts of said deceased with their own property, but solely with that property coming from the testate or intestate succession of said deceased.\" (Pavia <i>vs.<\/i> De la Rosa, herein above cited.)<br\/><br\/>It is maintained in appellees' brief that the plaintiff herein should have appealed from the order approving or ordering the partition, if he did not comply with the requirements prescribed by section 754 of the Code of Civil Procedure. According to this section, the heirs or devisees shall not obtain the partition of the estate until after the payment of the debts, unless they give a sufficient bond to secure the payment of the same. It is not necessary to discuss here whether the plaintiff could or could not have appealed from the said order; be this as it may, it is unquestionable that, issued as it was without the plaintiff being summoned or heard, it can in no manner injure him, as it could only affect those interested in obtaining it. Besides, the said order, by reason of its very nature, it having merely a distributional effect among the heirs and not being declaratory of the rights of third parties, can in no case deprive the plaintiff of the right to collect his claim once it has been duly recognized in the manner and form prescribed by law. The same section, 754, allows the supposition that some debt may be pending payment at the time of making the partition, in which case the heirs must give the proper bond to secure the payment of the debt. It is the duty of the judge to require the bond and the obligation of the heirs to furnish it; but it would be entirely unjust that a noncompliance on the part of the one or of the other should redound to the prejudice of the creditors, who are not required to take any part whatever in the partition. In the present case the partition was effected without prior summons or knowledge of the plaintiff who, for this reason, was unable opportunely to oppose it or to apply for the execution of the bond to secure the payment of his claim.<br\/><br\/>The agreement made among the heirs to release Francisco Enriquez and Carmen de la Cavada from the obligation of paying the debts of the estate, if effective among themselves, is not nor can it be binding upon the plaintiff, who was not a party thereto. (Art. 1257, Civil Code,) The heirs can not reduce by their own acts the creditor's security by limiting the liability of the estate to specific portions of the succession, which is equivalent to the release agreed upon of all responsibility with respect to the portions adjudicated to the heirs. The hereditary assets are always liable in their totality for the payment of the debts of the estate.<br\/><br\/>Therefore the defense made by the defendants and which is based on the agreement referred to, can not be admitted as valid.<br\/><br\/>By virtue of all the foregoing, the defendants should be adjudicated to pay to the plaintiff the amount claimed in the complaint, together with the legal interest thereon at the rate of 6 per cent per annum to count from the date of the filing of the complaint, proportionately to the part received by each one of them respectively in the quality of heir, and only to the extent of its value, from the testate estate of Antonio Enriquez and the intestate estate of Ciriaca Villanueva. And the debt having been contracted in francs and it being required that the payment of the same be ordered to be made in Philippine currency (sec. 3, Act No. 1045), an opportunity should be given to the parties to present evidence, which was not adduced at the trial, relative to the present equivalence between the two currencies, for which sole purpose, it being absolutely necessary for the fulfillment of the purposes of the Act cited, a new trial is ordered.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

that on or about\u00a0 the\u00a0 3d of August, 1900, the defendants illegally, without any rights, and in\u00a0 the absence of the plaintiffs\u00a0 herein, took\u00a0 possession of\u00a0 all the said personal and real property left by the said Sy Quia, deceased, and since then have managed and\u00a0 administered the same, alleging to be the owners thereof; that since the said\u00a0 3d day of August, 1900, the defendants\u00a0 and each of them have converted and are converting part\u00a0 of the property of the said Sy\u00a0 Quia, deceased,\u00a0 to the use and benefit of each of them,\u00a0 and a\u00a0 large\u00a0 part\u00a0 of\u00a0 the said property, consisting of real and personal property\u00a0 unknown to the plaintiffs, they being in possession thereof as owners, exercising over them acts of ownership, and\u00a0 converting them to their own use;

that in the said year 1852, Sy\u00a0 Quia having been converted to Christianity,\u00a0 was baptized An the parish church\u00a0 of San\u00a0 Vicente, Ilocos\u00a0 Sur,\u00a0 and\u00a0 named\u00a0 Vicente Ruperto Romero Sy Quia, as shown by the canonical certificates exhibited by the\u00a0 defendants, and\u00a0 marked \"Exhibits 1 and A,\" which are\u00a0 made a part\u00a0 of this answer; that on June 9, Vicente Ruperto Romero Sy Quia\u00a0 was married by the\u00a0 Church to Petronila\u00a0 Encarnacion in accordance with the canonical laws, as\u00a0 shown by\u00a0 the certified copies of the marriage certificate, marked \"Exhibits 2 and B,\" introduced by the other defendants; that Sy Quia and his wife Petronila Encarnacion established themselves\u00a0 and fixed their conjugal domicile in the Philippine Islands,\u00a0 where they continued to reside until the\u00a0 9th of January,\u00a0 1894,\u00a0 when the marriage was dissolved by the death of the husband in Manila;\u00a0 that\u00a0 the said\u00a0 spouses\u00a0 since\u00a0 their marriage had five\u00a0 children,\u00a0 of\u00a0 whom Apolinaria died\u00a0 a\u00a0 spinster, and Maria, who had married, died leaving a child, the defendant Generoso Mendoza, the grandson of the\u00a0 deceased Sy Quia, the said Generoso Mendoza and\u00a0 the other children\u00a0 of the deceased Sy Quia, named Gregorio, Pedro, and Juan, having survived; that Vicente Romero Sy Quia\u00a0 at the time of his marriage owned no property,\u00a0 while Petronila Encarnacion brought to the conjugal partnership a small capital, amounting to P5,000, which was the foundation of the large fortune subsequently acquired by them through their labor and industry, subsequently augmented with the aid of their own children.<br\/><br\/>That\u00a0 on\u00a0 the 9th of\u00a0 January,\u00a0 1894,\u00a0 Vicente Romero Sy Quia died, and\u00a0 after the necessary legal\u00a0 proceedings under the law of civil procedure then in force in these Islands, the Court\u00a0 of First Instance by\u00a0 a decree dated the 26th of the said month and year,\u00a0 declared that the surviving children, Apolinaria, Gregorio, Pedro, and Juan,\u00a0 and his grandchild\u00a0 Generoso Mendoza, representing his mother Maria, deceased, were the heirs of the deceased Sy Quia, intestate, as\u00a0 shown\u00a0 by Exhibits 8 and D,\u00a0 introduced by the other defendants; that\u00a0 on May 1,\u00a0 1900, the oldest daughter, Apolinaria, died\u00a0 intestate and single,\u00a0 leaving as her only heir her mother\u00a0 Petronila Encarnacion; that since the death of the said Vicente Romero Sy Quia the defendants had been in quiet, public, peaceful, and uninterrupted possession of the property left by the deceased Sy Quia, having held the same\u00a0 adversely, with good faith and just\u00a0 title; and that they have never been disturbed by the plaintiffs in such possession, notwithstanding the fact that they, the plaintiffs, were in the Philippine\u00a0 Islands at the time of the death of Vicente Romero Sy Quia, and had knowledge of the fact that the defendants had\u00a0 applied to the Court of\u00a0 First Instance\u00a0 for and secured\u00a0 a\u00a0 declaration to\u00a0 the effect that they were\u00a0 the heirs of the deceased Sy Quia; and that neither the plaintiffs\u00a0 nor\u00a0 the said Sy By Bo and Sy\u00a0 By Guit had ever been recognized or considered by the deceased Vicente Romero Sy Quia as his descendants, heirs or relatives, they never having been in possession of the legal status\u00a0 of children or legitimate descendants of\u00a0 the said Sy Quia; wherefore this defendant\u00a0 prayed that judgment be rendered in favor of all the defendants, acquitting them of the complaint, and directing that the plaintiffs pay the costs.<br\/><center><br\/>AMENDMENT TO THE COMPLAINT.<br\/><\/center> <br\/>The plaintiffs\u00a0 on the 31st of January, 1906, presented by way of\u00a0 reply to the answers of the various defendants an amendment to the original complaint, denying generally and specifically all and each of the\u00a0 material allegations set out in the answers of the defendants\u00a0 and alleging that the pretended marriage between Vicente Romero Sy Quia and Petronila Encarnacion was not a lawful marriage,\u00a0 but a false and fraudulent one, without\u00a0 any\u00a0 force,\u00a0 efficacy, or legal validity, the certificate of marriage presented by the defendants not\u00a0 being a true and correct certificate of marriage, the same being false, fraudulent, and without any force, efficacy,\u00a0 or legal validity, for the reason that on June 9, 1853, Vicente Romero\u00a0 Sy Quia was and thereafter continued to be the lawful husband of one Yap Puan Niu, until the year 1891, when she\u00a0 died, and that the marriage of Sy Quia\u00a0 with the said Yap Puan\u00a0 Niu, since 1847\u00a0 and until her death\u00a0 in 1891, was continuously in full force and effect, Sy Quia\u00a0 not having married again after the\u00a0 death of the said wife; and that Apolinaria,\u00a0 Maria, Gregorio, Pedro and Juan, the alleged legitimate children of Vicente Romero Sy Quia and Petronila Encarnacion, were not and never had been\u00a0 the\u00a0 legitimate children\u00a0 of Sy Quia, and that they were not and never had been his legitimate heirs and descendants, the certificates\u00a0 of baptism produced by the defendants, and marked\u00a0 \"Exhibits 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7,\" not being true nor proper, but false and fraudulent, and of no force, efficacy, or legal validity, tKe said children not being the legitimate descendants of the deceased\u00a0 Sy, Quia. Paragraphs 9 and 10 of the amended complaint are a repetition of similar paragraphs contained in the original.<br\/><center><br\/>ANSWER TO THE AMENDED COMPLAINT.<br\/><\/center> <br\/>The defendants, Generoso Mendoza,\u00a0 Petronila Encarnacion, Pedro Sy Quia, Gregorio Sy Quia, and Juan\u00a0 Sy Quia, filed their\u00a0 answers to the amended complaint on\u00a0 the 7th and\u00a0 13th of February, 1906,\u00a0 denying all and each of the allegations contained in paragraphs 2, 3, 4, and\u00a0 5 of the amended complaint,\u00a0 stating that they ratified each and all of the allegations, denials\u00a0 and defenses contained in their previous answer, which they\u00a0 reproduced\u00a0 therein, and that they renewed their prayer that judgment be rendered acquitting them\u00a0 of the said complaint, with the costs\u00a0 against the plaintiffs.<br\/><br\/>On June\u00a0 19,\u00a0 1906, counsel for Petronila\u00a0 Encarnacion notified the court in writing of the death of\u00a0 the said Petronila\u00a0 Encarnacion, who died in this city on\u00a0 the\u00a0 6th of the said month, and as counsel for the other defendants, \u00a3edro and\u00a0 Juan Sy Quia,\u00a0 moved the court that\u00a0 in accordance with section\u00a0 119\u00a0 of the Code\u00a0 of Civil Procedure, an order be made directing that\u00a0 the action\u00a0 be\u00a0 proceeded with in the name of the administrator of her estate, Pedro Sy Quia, which\u00a0 motion was granted without any\u00a0 objection on the part of the plaintiffs' attorney, on June 21, 1906.<br\/><br\/>On August 20, 1906, it\u00a0 was stipulated between\u00a0 counsel for both parties that by order of the court the deposition of several witnesses then designated by the plaintiffs be taken at Amoy, China,\u00a0 before the consul,\u00a0 vice-consul, or a consular agent\u00a0 of the United\u00a0 States in the\u00a0 said city, during the days\u00a0 and in the manner agreed upon,\u00a0 in accordance with\u00a0 section 362 of the Code of Civil\u00a0 Procedure,\u00a0 the defendants\u00a0 being\u00a0 authorized to take the deposition\u00a0 of\u00a0 such witnesses as they might desire to present in the\u00a0 manner agreed upon.<br\/><br\/>On November 8, 1906, counsel for plaintiffs informed the court of the death of one of the plaintiffs, Sy Jui\u00a0 Niu, at Amoy, China, on or about the 28th of July of the said year, and she having died intestate, the court on November 8, appointed C.\u00a0 W. O'Brien as special\u00a0 administrator of\u00a0 her estate, and said counsel thereupon asked the\u00a0 court to allow the action to be continued\u00a0 by him, and, by a subsequent petition filed on the\u00a0 13th of the same month, the administrator C. W. O'Brien, appointed as aforesaid,\u00a0 filed a written appearance as such\u00a0 administrator of the estate of the deceased Sy Jui Niu.<br\/><br\/>On a petition filed\u00a0 on the 17th of November, 1906, counsel for both\u00a0 parties informed\u00a0 the\u00a0 court that the documents presented by the defendants, and marked \"Exhibits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,\u00a0 and 7, and A, B, and C,\" which are\u00a0 certificates of baptism, marriage, and burial, should\u00a0 be considered as original and authentic documents, so as to avoid the necessity of presenting the originals themselves, which were\u00a0 bound in book form, together\u00a0 with\u00a0 other documents\u00a0 relating to\u00a0 persons who had no connection with this litigation.<br\/><br\/>On the 4th of January, 1907, the defendants presented a motion to the Court\u00a0 of\u00a0 First Instance, asking that the\u00a0 depositions taken\u00a0 before the consul\u00a0 of\u00a0 the United\u00a0 States at Amoy, China, as given\u00a0 by the witnesses for\u00a0 the plaintiffs, named Li Ung Bing, Sy Peng, Lim Chio, Yap Si Tan, Yap Chia, Sy Kay\u00a0 Tit, Yap Chong, Sy Boan, Sy Kong Len, and Sy Hong Oan, whose testimony the plaintiffs attempted to introduce in this action, be not admitted, defendants' motion being based on the ground\u00a0 that the\u00a0 said depositions contained a formal defect concerning the manner in which the oath was administered to the witnesses.<br\/><br\/>In a petition filed on the same date, January 4, the defendants\u00a0 reproduced their former\u00a0 motion,\u00a0 alleging as a further ground in\u00a0 support thereof that the\u00a0 certificates by the\u00a0 officer who\u00a0 took the said depositions did not comply with the essential requisites provided by law, and after due notice to the plaintiffs, a\u00a0 hearing was had\u00a0 upon\u00a0 the said petition on January 7, 1907.\u00a0 After the recital of the evidence introduced by both parties, and after the documents exhibited by them, together\u00a0 with the depositions\u00a0 taken at Vigan of various witnesses for the defendants, and of the depositions taken at Amoy, China, had been united to the record, the Court of First Instance on the 26th of February, 1908, rendered a judgment declaring that the plaintiffs Sy Joe Lieng, Sy Yoc Chay, Sy Chua Niu, and C.\u00a0 W.\u00a0 O'Brien, the\u00a0 latter as guardian of Sian\u00a0 Han, and the defendants Gregorio\u00a0 Sy\u00a0 Quia,\u00a0 Pedro Sy Quia, Juan Sy\u00a0 Quia, and Generoso Mendoza Sy Quia, and the heirs of the deceased Petronila Encarnacion, represented by\u00a0 one of the defendants, Pedro Sy Quia, as the administrator of the property, were the heirs\u00a0 of\u00a0 the property of the estate of Vicente Romero Sy Quia, now deceased, consisting of one-half of the\u00a0 property distributed by the order of the Court of'First\u00a0 Instance of the district of Quiapo\u00a0 of the 3d of August,\u00a0 1900, in the following form: To\u00a0 Sy Joe Lieng, one-ninth; Sy Yoc Chay, one-ninth;\u00a0 Sy Chua Niu, one-ninth; C. W.\u00a0 O'Brien, as the guardian\u00a0 of Sian Han, one-ninth; Pedro\u00a0 Sy\u00a0 Quia, one-ninth; Juan Sy Quia, one-ninth; Gregorio Sy Quia, one-ninth ; Generoso Mendoza Sy Quia, one-ninth; and the heirs of Petronila\u00a0 Encarnacion,\u00a0 represented by\u00a0 Pedro\u00a0 Sy Quia as the administrator of the latter's\u00a0 estate,\u00a0 one-ninth; the heirs of\u00a0 the\u00a0 said Petronila\u00a0 Encarnacion,\u00a0 represented\u00a0 by the administrator of her estate, being the owners\u00a0 with the right to possession of the\u00a0 other half of the property left by Vicente Romero Sy Quia at the time of his death.<br\/><br\/>That the defendants, Gregorio, Pedro, Juan, and Generoso, and Pedro Sy Quia as the administrator of the\u00a0 property of his mother Petronila Encarnacion and as a representative of the\u00a0 latter's heirs,\u00a0 render a statement of the property which was distributed among them under and by virtue of the order of the Court of First Instance, of the 3d of August, 1900.<br\/><br\/>That the said defendants and each of them render an accounting of the rents and profits of all the property respectively received by them\u00a0 from the dates\u00a0 when they\u00a0 were delivered to them, it being understood that if upon making the inventory of the property it appears that the portion thereof assigned to Petronila Encarnacion as her share does not exceed one-half of all the property left by Vicente Romero Sy Quia, at the time of his\u00a0 death, it will not be necessary\u00a0 to\u00a0 render an accounting of the rents anol profits of the portion to her thus assigned.<br\/><br\/>That a receiver, to\u00a0 be selected later, be appointed\u00a0 upon the giving of a sufficient bond,\u00a0 the amount of which will be hereafter fixed, to take charge and possession of all the property known as aforesaid, it being understood that if upon\u00a0 making a list of the said property it appears that the part thereof assigned to Petronila Encarnacion as her share does\u00a0 not exceed one-half of\u00a0 all the property of the estate of Vicente Romero Sy Quia\u00a0 at the time of his death, the said receiver shall only take possession\u00a0 of one-half of the property assigned to the other persons who have accounted for them.\u00a0\u00a0 The Court of First\u00a0 Instance\u00a0 made no special order as to costs.<br\/><br\/>To\u00a0 this decision of\u00a0 the trial court counsel\u00a0 for the defendants, Pedro Sy Quia,\u00a0 by himself\u00a0 and as administrator of the estate of Petronila Encarnacion, Juan Sy Quia, Gregorio Sy Quia, and Generoso Mendoza, duly excepted, and by a\u00a0 motion presented to the court\u00a0 asked that\u00a0 the\u00a0 said judgment be set aside and\u00a0 a new\u00a0 trial\u00a0 granted, on the ground\u00a0 that the evidence was\u00a0 insufficient to justify the decision in favor of the plaintiffs, and because the decision of the trial court was contrary to law, the findings of fact being plainly\u00a0 and manifestly against the weight of the evidence.\u00a0 Upon notice to counsel for\u00a0 plaintiffs, a hearing was had upon said motions, which were subsequently over-ruled by the court.\u00a0 Defendants having duly excepted to the order of the court overruling the same,\u00a0 and upon filing their bill of\u00a0 exceptions, asked the court to unite\u00a0 to the\u00a0 same all\u00a0 of the evidence taken and introduced by both parties, with the\u00a0 documents and pleadings presented during the course of the trial, the transcript of the stenographic\u00a0 notes containing the testimony of the witnesses, and the depositions taken\u00a0 at Vigan and Amoy, which said bill of exceptions defendants asked the court to approve and certify to the Supreme Court, with all of the said evidence which was made an integral part thereof.<br\/><br\/>By an order entered on the 28th of March, 1908, the court upon\u00a0 certifying the bill\u00a0 of exceptions,\u00a0 directed that the execution\u00a0 of the\u00a0 judgment\u00a0 be\u00a0 not stayed in\u00a0 so far\u00a0 as\u00a0 it required the defendants to submit a statement showing the property received\u00a0 by them, and to render an account of all the rents\u00a0 and profits,\u00a0 upon giving a bond satisfactory to the court,\u00a0 to secure the fulfillment of the judgment in\u00a0 case the same\u00a0 be totally or partially affirmed by the Supreme Court.<br\/><br\/>The trial\u00a0 court\u00a0 in deciding the motion for\u00a0 the appointment of a\u00a0 receiver, and after hearing both parties, made an order on the 17th\u00a0 of March, 1908, appointing Gregorio Sy Quia as receiver\u00a0 of the property in\u00a0 question, upon the giving of a bond in the sum\u00a0 of P400,000, to be approved by the court, and in case that\u00a0 the\u00a0 person thus appointed did not accept,\u00a0 the appointment\u00a0 would be set aside, and\u00a0 a stranger duly qualified substituted.\u00a0 To this order of the court the defendants Pedro Sy Quia and Juan Sy Quia duly excepted, and on the 27th of March, 1908, there was united to the proper files\u00a0 the personal bond for P400,000 given by the receiver.<br\/><br\/>By another order made on the said 17th day of March, the court in deciding\u00a0 the motion that\u00a0 a time be\u00a0 fixed within which the defendants should report to the court whatever property belonging to the deceased Vicente Romero Sy Quia was distributed among them, directed that the defendants Juan Sy Quia, Generoso Mendoza and Pedro Sy Quia, the latter by himself and\u00a0 as administrator of the\u00a0 estate of Petronila Encarnacion,\u00a0 submit a\u00a0 statement of the property distributed among them under and by virtue of the order of the 3d of August, 190D, on or before the\u00a0 23d day\u00a0 of March, 1908, and that Gregorio Sy Quia submit a similar\u00a0 statement on or before the 31st day of the\u00a0 said month and\u00a0 year.<br\/><br\/>Pedro Sy Quia and Juan Sy Quia excepted to this order of the court dated March\u00a0 17 as\u00a0 aforesaid, requiring them to submit a statement of the property they had received, and

plaintiffs, upon being notified of the said judgment of the court, excepted thereto, and requested in writing that the court modify its decision and\u00a0 conclusions of law by declaring\u00a0 that the plaintiffs Sy Joe Lieng, Sy Yoc Ohay, Sy Chua Niu, and G. W. O'Brien, as the guardian of Sian Han,\u00a0 were\u00a0 the\u00a0 only heirs\u00a0 of\u00a0 Vicente\u00a0 Romero\u00a0 Sy Quia, deceased;\u00a0 that they were entitled to all the property left by the latter, and distributed under the order of the court of the 3d of August, 1900;\u00a0 that Petronila\u00a0 Encarnacion, deceased, and her children and heirs had no interest in the said estate of Sy Quia; that they were not the heirs of the deceased\u00a0 Vicente Romero Sy Quia; that the receiver appointed\u00a0 by\u00a0 the court be authorized to take possession of all the property left by the said deceased, especially the property which was distributed by the decree of the court of the\u00a0 3d\u00a0 of\u00a0 August, 1900, together with the rents and profits, and that the said judgment be modified, awarding the plaintiffs\u00a0 the costs\u00a0 of the\u00a0 action, and directing that defendants submit an accounting of the property in litigation.<br\/><br\/>This\u00a0 action\u00a0 has for its purpose primarily to recover from the present possessors the property left at\u00a0 the time of his death in this\u00a0 city by the Christian Chinaman, Vicente Romero Sy Quia, the\u00a0 plaintiffs alleging that three of them are the grandchildren and one\u00a0 the great-grandson\u00a0 of the deceased Sy Quia by his lawful marriage in his own country with their\u00a0 deceased grandmother, Yap Puan Nzu.\u00a0 So that the marriage of the said\u00a0 Sy Quia with this woman in China is practically\u00a0 the fundamental basis of the\u00a0 action brought by the plaintiffs for the recovery of the inheritance against the defendants, who appear to\u00a0 be the\u00a0 children\u00a0 of the deceased Sy\u00a0 Quia by his marriage in these Islands with the native, Petronila Encarnacion.<br\/><br\/>Does\u00a0 the record\u00a0 show that the Chinaman\u00a0 Sy Quia removed from Vigan,\u00a0 Philippine Islands, to his native town or village\u00a0 of\u00a0 Am Thau, Amoy,\u00a0 China, in\u00a0 1847, and then married in accordance with the rites and ceremonies of his native country, Yap Puan Niu?<br\/><br\/>Plaintiffs having failed to present at the trial\u00a0 the matrimonial letters\u00a0 which should have been exchanged between the contracting parties at the time the said marriage was performed, according to the ancient laws and customs of the Celestial Kingdom, and there being no allegation\u00a0 in the complaint as to the day and month of the common calendar year, or of the Chinese calendar year,\u00a0 when the said marriage took\u00a0 place, there is no ground on which to base the conclusion that such an\u00a0 important act\u00a0 in the life\u00a0 of Sy Quia has been duly established by authentic documents, nor is his alleged voyage to China\u00a0 from the port of Manila for the purpose of contracting such marriage, satisfactorily proven thereby, for the plaintiffs\u00a0 have\u00a0 likewise failed to introduce in evidence the passport, required by the legislation then in force, which should and would have been then issued to Sy\u00a0 Quia in order to\u00a0 enable him to leave\u00a0 this country and\u00a0 return to his own.\u00a0\u00a0 (See superior decree of December 20,1849.)<br\/><br\/>Seven witnesses, named Sy Peng, Lim\u00a0 Chio, Yap Si Tan, Yap Chia, Sy Kai Tit, Yap Chong, and Sy Botm, whose respective ages are not less than 71 nor more than 80 years, in their testimony or depositions before\u00a0 the vice-consul of the United States at Amoy, having\u00a0 promised to tell the truth, affirmed through an interpreter that they were present at the ceremony of the wedding\u00a0 of the said Sy Quia with the Chinese woman Yap Puan Niu; that\u00a0 Sy Quia, who was in these Islands, having\u00a0 been expressly called\u00a0 to China by his father for the\u00a0 purpose of marrying the said Yap Puan Niu, accordingly returned to his native town\u00a0 or village of Am Thau, and, after being\u00a0 married to Yap Puan Niu, remained\u00a0 in the said village three of four years with his wife, by whom he had two children, Sy By Bo and Sy By Guit, the latter having been bom one year after the birth of the former.<br\/><br\/>To overcome the testimony pi the witnesses for the plaintiffs, the defendants presented nine witnesses, to wit: Felix Millan, Aniceto Singson, Norberta Feril,\u00a0 Remigio Tongson, Estefania Crisologo, Alexandra Singson, Benita Encarnacion, Paulino Revilla, and Silveria\u00a0 Damian, whose respective ages were not less than 71 nor\u00a0 more than 87 years, except Aniceto Singson, who was only 66 years of age, who testified, some of them in the Court of First Instance of Manila, and the others before the justice of the peace of Vigan by virtue of a commission, that they knew\u00a0 Sy Quia when he was an unmarried resident of the city of Vigan, for six or seven years according to most of the said witnesses, and for five years according to others, prior to his marriage with Petronila Encarnacion, they having known him when he was a clerk and dry goods salesman for another\u00a0 Chinaman by the name of Jose Gloria Lecaroz, a resident of Manila, the witness Revilla stating that he was gobernadorcillo in 1852, when Sy Quia, after being converted to the\u00a0 Christian religion,\u00a0 was baptized in\u00a0 the\u00a0 church of San\u00a0 Vicente, the priest of which, who was his (Revilla's)\u00a0 uncle, being frequently\u00a0 visited\u00a0 by the said Sy Quia for the purpose of the Iatter's instruction in the new religion,\u00a0 and that Sy Quia\u00a0 upon being baptized was named Vicente Ruperto Romero, after his godfather Romero, who was at\u00a0 that time the clerk of the court; and Silveria Damian further testified that to the best of her recollection Sy Quia arrived in Vigan in the year 1848, stopping at her\u00a0 house,\u00a0 Sy Quia being a friend and countryman\u00a0 of her\u00a0 husband, who was\u00a0 also a Chinaman, and\u00a0 that she\u00a0 knew\u00a0 that Sy Quia was then a bachelor, that he was baptized\u00a0 some\u00a0 years later,\u00a0 and on the following year\u00a0 was married to Petronila\u00a0 Encarnacion. Silveria\u00a0 Damian, her husband and\u00a0 other witnesses\u00a0 in the case attended the wedding.<br\/><br\/>It will be seen therefore that the record contains\u00a0 strikingly conflicting evidence, that\u00a0 is to say,\u00a0 the evidence introduced by the plaintiffs is directly in conflict with that adduced by the defendants for while the witnesses for the\u00a0 plaintiffs asserted that Sy Quia was at Am Thau, Amoy, in\u00a0 1847, and contracted marriage in that year with Yap Puan Niu, with whom be continued to live for\u00a0 about three or four years thereafter, during which\u00a0 time the\u00a0 children\u00a0 Sy By Bo and Sy By Guit were born; the witnesses for the defendants on the other hand affirmed that\u00a0 Sy Quia was at the time in Vigan, and that he did not leave\u00a0 that city during the six or seven\u00a0 years,\u00a0 according to\u00a0 most of the\u00a0 witnesses,\u00a0 and during tfre five years, according to the others, which immediately preceded his marriage with Petronila Encarnacion in 1853.<br\/><br\/>In order to determine whether the weight and preponderance of the evidence is with the plaintiffs or in favor of the defendants, in accordance with the provisions of section 273 of the\u00a0 Code of Civil Procedure, it becomes necessary to examine\u00a0 and analyze each of the\u00a0 declarations of the respective witnesses presented at the trial, and ascertain the result of their various declarations taken as a whole, bearing in mind the circumstances of the case, the probability or improbability of their\u00a0 testimony, with due regard to the nature of the facts as to which they testified, their degree of intelligence, and the manner in which they testified.<br\/><br\/>The presence of Sy Quia\u00a0 in Vigan, and his presence at the same time at Am Thau, Province of Amoy,\u00a0 China, for a period of four years, to wit, from 1847 to 1850, two facts which are directly inconsistent with each other, might have been\u00a0 satisfactorily established\u00a0 by the\u00a0 testimony of witnesses, but the only proof of the fact of the marriage alleged to have\u00a0 been contracted\u00a0 by Sy\u00a0 Quia at the said Chinese town in\u00a0 1847 could only have consisted of the matrimonial letters or cards which should have been exchanged between the families\u00a0 of the two contracting parties\u00a0 in the manner referred to by\u00a0 the witness\u00a0 Li Ung\u00a0 Bing, the\u00a0 interpreter of the American Consulate, who was called by the plaintiffs themselves, and whose testimony in this respect is uniformly corroborated by Nicolay\u00a0 in his book entitled \"<i>Historia de las Creencias,\"<\/i>\u00a0 by Ratzel in his\u00a0 book entitled \"<i>Las Razas Humanas,<\/i>\" by Cantu in\u00a0 his work entitled\u00a0 <i>\"Historia\u00a0 Universal,<\/i>\" and by the authors of the \"Spanish American Encyclopedic Dictionary.\"\u00a0 These matrimonial letters, once\u00a0 they have been mutually exchanged by the contracting parties, constitute the essential requisite\u00a0 required by the laws of that country\u00a0 in order that a Chinese marriage may be considered duly\u00a0 solemnized, and at the same time are the best proof of\u00a0 its having actually taken place.<br\/><br\/>The party obliged\u00a0 to\u00a0 exhibit these letters can only be relieved from the necessity of so doing by proving that the same\u00a0 have been lost or\u00a0 disappeared, for in the absence of such proof\u00a0 (there being none of this character in\u00a0 the record), they must be produced\u00a0 at the trial\u00a0 in\u00a0 order to establish the fact of the marriage\u00a0 alleged to have taken place, and\u00a0 only in the cases expressly excepted by law\u00a0 can any\u00a0 other\u00a0 proof,\u00a0 such\u00a0 as the testimony of witnesses,\u00a0 be allowed, but the letters themselves must\u00a0 be produced as evidence of the contract to which they relate, in accordance with the provisions of section 285 of the\u00a0 Code of Civil Procedure.<br\/><br\/>The failure to produce the said matrimonial letters which, according to some of the\u00a0 witnesses for the plaintiffs, were exchanged\u00a0 between both\u00a0 families prior to the celebration of the\u00a0 marriage of Sy\u00a0 Quia with Yap Puan Niu, and\u00a0 the lack of proof that they had been destroyed or lost,\u00a0 give rise to the\u00a0 legal presumption\u00a0 that the marriage was\u00a0 not performed; and such\u00a0 presumption can not be overcome by\u00a0 the testimony of witnesses, some of them incompetent, while the testimony of others is conflicting, not to say contradictory, in itself, as well as\u00a0 highly improbable; for\u00a0 this is a most important contract,\u00a0 which, according to\u00a0 the ancient laws and customs of China, must be evidenced by\u00a0 such\u00a0 letters or cards, and\u00a0 the fact that these letters\u00a0 have\u00a0 not been produced shows that the marriage never took place; if they actually exist they should be exhibited, for it is a well-known rule that where evidence\u00a0 is wilfully suppressed, it is presumed that it would be\u00a0 adverse to the party presenting\u00a0 the same, if produced.\u00a0\u00a0 (Sec. 334, par.\u00a0 5, Code of Civil Procedure.)<br\/><br\/>Entering upon an analysis of the testimony\u00a0 of\u00a0 the witnesses\u00a0 for\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiffs,\u00a0 it will be\u00a0 noticed that Sy Peng stated that upon the death of\u00a0 Sy Quia, the women of\u00a0 his house extended their sympathy, as customary, to his widow in China.\u00a0\u00a0 This, however, is not true, because it appears in the\u00a0 record\u00a0 as\u00a0 a proved fact that Yap Puan Niu died in 1891, while Sy Quia died\u00a0 in\u00a0 this city\u00a0 in 1894,\u00a0\u00a0 Lim Chio affirmed that Sy By Bo,\u00a0 the alleged son of\u00a0 Sy Quia, had two children by his wife,\u00a0 one of them being\u00a0 Sy Yoc Chay. This is not true, because Sy Yoc Chay was only an adopted son.\u00a0 The witness Yap Si Tan\u00a0 testified that Yap Puan Niu lost a natural child, whose name she did not remember, and in his place adopted Sy Yoc Chay as her son.\u00a0 This fact is not\u00a0 testified to by any\u00a0 of the other witnesses, who simply said that the adoption had been made by Sy By Bo.\u00a0\u00a0 The witness Yap Chio, 72 years of age, who testified that he had been present at the wedding of Sy\u00a0 Quia with Yap Puan Niu, must have been 8 years old at the time.\u00a0\u00a0 The other witness, Sy Kai Tit, who was 71 years of age, and who, according to himself, was about 12 years\u00a0 old at the time, stated that he had taken part in the investigation made as to the status and condition\u00a0 of the bride,\u00a0 Yap Puan Niu, having\u00a0 assisted\u00a0 Sy\u00a0 Quia's parents and\u00a0 the\u00a0 mediator in the investigation.\u00a0 Another witness by the name of Sy Boan testified that Sy Quia, when he died in this city, was survived by his wife, Yap Puan Niu,\u00a0 who was still living in China,\u00a0 this being in direct\u00a0 contradiction\u00a0 with the established fact that Yap Puan Niu\u00a0 died before Sy Quia.\u00a0\u00a0 This witness further said that when Sy Quia returned for the second time to China, in order to attend his parents' funeral, his alleged wife, Yap Puan\u00a0 Niu, was still living,\u00a0 his\u00a0 testimony\u00a0 in this respect being in contradiction with that of the other witnesses, Lim Chio,\u00a0 Yap Si Tan, Yap Chio and Sy Kai\u00a0 Tit.<br\/><br\/>The testimony of\u00a0 these witnesses,\u00a0 most of whom have seriously contradicted themselves upon important points in the course of their examination, and some of them, considering the fact that they were very young in 1847, having told a very improbable story, claiming that they had assisted Sy Quia's parents in bringing about the latter's marriage, can be given no credence by the courts to sustain a finding that Sy\u00a0 Quia actually married Yap Puan Niu, much less so the marriages of Sy By\u00a0 Bo and\u00a0 Sy By Guit who are alleged to be the legitimate children\u00a0 of the said Sy Quia and Yap Puan Niu,\u00a0 and the marriage of Sy Jui Niu, the\u00a0 mother of Sian\u00a0 Han, a grandson of Sy By Bo and a great-grandson of Sy Quia, for the reason that there were not introduced in evidence at the trial the matrimonial\u00a0 letters that must have been\u00a0 exchanged before the celebration of these marriages, all of these witnesses having simply said that they attended the wedding of Sy Quia and Yap Puan Niu, that their said sons were also subsequently married and each had two children,\u00a0 and that\u00a0 Sy By Bo adopted Sy Yoc Chay in place of one of his deceased children.\u00a0 From the testimony of these witnesses,\u00a0 taken as\u00a0 a whole, it is impossible to arrive at the truth and to lay the foundation of a just judgment in accordance with the law.<br\/><br\/>The witness Sy Hien, who claims to be a younger brother of Sy Quia, and was a witness for the plaintiffs, among the many conflicting statements made by him, as may be seen from his testimony, said\u00a0 that his certificates\u00a0 of marriage, which presumably consisted of similar matrimonial\u00a0 letters or cards,\u00a0 were kept in his own town, and\u00a0 that he was unable\u00a0 to state the difference in age between\u00a0 himself, who was\u00a0 59 years\u00a0 old, and\u00a0 his\u00a0 brother Sy Quia,\u00a0 who, had\u00a0 he lived, would today\u00a0 be\u00a0 about 80 years old, unless he was permitted to examine a certain book kept\u00a0 in his own home in China\u00a0 (p.\u00a0 116 of the record).\u00a0 His\u00a0 testimony\u00a0 clearly shows that such matrimonial letters are duly preserved and that the date\u00a0 of birth of the members\u00a0 of\u00a0 a family\u00a0 is noted or entered in a book\u00a0 kept in the paternal residence, in like\u00a0 manner as the death of such members of the family is\u00a0 recorded by\u00a0 mortuary\u00a0 inscriptions\u00a0 on tablets,\u00a0 a practice which\u00a0 is\u00a0 very natural among\u00a0 people who live in civilized communities and cities with\u00a0 a civilization\u00a0 of their own\u00a0 and who, like the Chinese,\u00a0 notwithstanding their remarkable backwardness with reference to more advanced and\u00a0 cultured races, generally speaking are not barbarians and do not live a nomad or savage life.<br\/><br\/>The mortuary inscriptions upon one of the\u00a0 tablets presented in evidence at the time of taking the\u00a0 evidence of some of the witnesses who were called by the plaintiffs for the purpose of establishing\u00a0 that the deceased, Sy\u00a0 Quia,\u00a0 had in his lifetime married Yap Puan Niu, an English translation of\u00a0 which\u00a0 appears in the records,\u00a0 are not conclusive or supplementary proof of the said marriage, because they are absolutely false and contrary to the actual facts with reference\u00a0 to\u00a0 Sy Quia, for\u00a0 the latter was still alive in\u00a0 1891, when he\u00a0 was presumed to be dead\u00a0 according to the said inscriptions, he having actually died in January, 1894; therefore the said mortuary tablet, and the inscriptions appearing thereon, can not serve to corroborate the testimony of the witnesses who testified to the celebration of the marriage, because such tablet\u00a0 and inscriptions are\u00a0 glaringly false, the fact that the\u00a0 witness Sy\u00a0 Peng said that Jthis tablet, together with others, was taken\u00a0 by him from the temple or sanctuary of Sy Quia's family\u00a0 at Am Thau, to be introduced as evidence\u00a0 in this action,\u00a0 to the contrary notwithstanding.\u00a0 The falsity of the inscription of Sy Quia's death, when he\u00a0 was still alive, made upon a tablet which was evidently prepared with remarkable haste and temerity, is borne\u00a0 out by the\u00a0 witness\u00a0 Li\u00a0 Ung\u00a0 Bing,\u00a0 the interpreter of the American consulate, who claimed to be familiar with the laws and customs of his country, for, according to him, where Chinese die out of China no\u00a0 inscription is made at the place of their\u00a0 former residence in\u00a0 China,\u00a0 upon\u00a0 such tablets, of the fact of their death; and as it is a fact, admitted\u00a0 by\u00a0 the plaintiffs, that\u00a0 Sy Quia died in Manila and was buried in La Loma cemetery, there is no doubt that the tablet in question was fraudulently prepared and fabricated to supply the lack of documentary proof as to the so much talked about marriage in China which is the fundamental basis of plaintiffs' claim.<br\/><br\/>In the\u00a0 administrative\u00a0 proceedings that\u00a0 Sy Quia must have instituted for the purpose of securing the\u00a0 necessary permission\u00a0 to marry\u00a0 Petronila Encarnacion,\u00a0 and\u00a0 at the investigation which, after the obtaining of such permission, must\u00a0 have been\u00a0 conducted by the\u00a0 ecclesiastical\u00a0 court\u00a0 of the ^bishopric of Vigan, he, Sy Quia, necessarily must have declared that he was single, as evidently he did,\u00a0 according to the\u00a0 testimony of the witness Roman Gray, 72\u00a0 years of age, then a clerk of that court, whose testimony under oath is supported by that of other witnesses, two of them being of the same race as Sy Quia, and in view of the result of the\u00a0 said\u00a0 proceedings and\u00a0 investigation, conducted\u00a0 as aforesaid, the parish priest of the said city of Vigan was authorized to marry Vicente Sy Quia to Petronila Encarnacion, the certificate of marriage reciting the fact that there was no impediment whatever to the performance of the marriage.<br\/><br\/>Without the aforesaid permission of the Governor-General, sought\u00a0 and obtained in accordance with sections\u00a0 34 and 35 of the superior decree of the 20th of December, 1849, the vicar-general of the\u00a0 bishopric of Vigan would not have admitted\u00a0 the testimony\u00a0 given by the\u00a0 witnesses in the investigation for\u00a0 the purpose of\u00a0 proving that Vicente Sy Quia was\u00a0 single and free to marry, nor could the parish priest have performed the marriage\u00a0 ceremony without first securing the necessary authority from the court of the vicar-general in the name of the bishop.<br\/><br\/>Therefore the result of those proceedings and the canonical\u00a0 certificate,\u00a0 evidencing\u00a0 the\u00a0 marriage of\u00a0 Vicente Sy Quia and\u00a0 Petronila Encarnacion,\u00a0 corroborate the testimony of the\u00a0 witnesses for the\u00a0 defendants to the effect\u00a0 that Sy Quia was single and had resided for many years in that city before he married Petronila\u00a0 Encarnacion, and that he could not\u00a0 have spent four years\u00a0 at Am Thau,\u00a0 province\u00a0 of Amoy,\u00a0 China, during that period,\u00a0 as alleged.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the validity and efficacy of the canonical certificates and the certified copies thereof introduced here in evidence, we adhere to and follow\u00a0 the doctrine laid down by this\u00a0 court in the case of the\u00a0 United States<i> vs,<\/i> Nicolas Arceo\u00a0 (11 Phil. Rep., 530), No.\u00a0 4539, wherein this court said:<br\/><br\/>\"The canonical entries in\u00a0 parochial books have not lost the character of public documents for the purpose of proving such acts as are therein related, inasmuch as, since the change of sovereignty in\u00a0 these Islands, no legal provision has been\u00a0 promulgated to destroy\u00a0 the official and\u00a0 public character that the said entries had under the former regime.<br\/><br\/>\"Parish priests continue in the legal custody of the parochial books kept during the former sovereignty, and as such legal custodians they may issue literal copies in the form of certificates of the entries contained therein, in like manner as custodians of archives.\"<br\/><br\/>To strengthen\u00a0 the proof\u00a0 introduced by the plaintiffs as to Sy Quia's marriage\u00a0 to Yap\u00a0 Puan Niu, an\u00a0 attempt was made to establish that the said Yap Puan Niu had been twice in Manila, the last time in\u00a0 1886; that on these two occasions she\u00a0 stopped for five or six months at the house of\u00a0 Sy Tay, Sy Quia's\u00a0 brother, and that Sy Quia frequently called\u00a0 on her\u00a0 at the said house; but,\u00a0 notwithstanding the testimony of some witnesses who testified to this effect, particularly Sy Hien, who claimed to be one of Sy Quia's brothers, and who testified long after Sy Quia's\u00a0 death, we\u00a0 have in\u00a0 the record the sworn statement\u00a0 to the contrary by the\u00a0 Chinese woman, Ana Quang Su, the wife of the said\u00a0 Sy Tay, who positively\u00a0 testified\u00a0 that upon the\u00a0 two occasions that\u00a0 the said Yap Puan Niu stopped as a guest at the house of\u00a0 her husband for a\u00a0 period of five or six months, she had never seen Sy Quia call on her, Yap Puan Niu,\u00a0 and that the said Yap Puan\u00a0 Niu\u00a0 never went out\u00a0 of the house but remained at home as was\u00a0 customary with Chinese women, adding that she would have known if\u00a0 it had been otherwise,\u00a0 because said Yap Puan Niu occupied\u00a0 a room adjoining hers in the same house, the witness being always at home, further saying that her husband Sy Tay supported the said guest, Yap Puan\u00a0 Niu, and paid for her transportation both ways between\u00a0 Manila and China,\u00a0 and that Sy\u00a0 Joe Lien\u00a0 and\u00a0 Sy Yoc\u00a0 Chay, who on successive dates came to Manila from China, also stopped at her, the witness's house, where they lived at the expense and under\u00a0 the\u00a0 orders of\u00a0 her husband Sy Tay.\u00a0 The testimony of\u00a0 this witness\u00a0 is of the utmost importance, and has not been impugned\u00a0 or discredited in any way in this case.<br\/><br\/>The witness, Roman\u00a0 Gray, above referred to, affirmed that while he was clerk of the ecclesiastical court of Vigan, which position he had held since 1850, he met the Chinaman\u00a0 Sy Quia when\u00a0 the latter went to his\u00a0 court for\u00a0 the purpose of being baptized as a Christian, stating that\u00a0 the said Sy Quia several years thereafter, in 1853, presented a petition for permission to marry, whereupon the necessary proceedings were instituted, in which said proceedings two Chinese witnesses and Sy Quia himself stated\u00a0 under oath that Sy Quia was single and free to marry, and a decree was subsequently\u00a0 entered authorizing the performance of the marriage with Petronila\u00a0 Encarnacion, the witness further stating that he\u00a0 had read the proceedings but that in 1898 the papers were destroyed by the insurgents, who\u00a0 removed everything from\u00a0 the place where the\u00a0 archives were kept and occupied the premises for some\u00a0 length of time.<br\/><br\/>Aside from what has been said before,\u00a0 there\u00a0 is no other evidence in the record to show that the\u00a0 plaintiffs, particularly Sy Chua Niu,\u00a0 Sy\u00a0 Joe Lieng and Sy Yoc Chay, were ever recognized as legitimate grandchildren and adopted grandchild, respectively, and\u00a0 that Sian Han\u00a0 is the greatgrandchild of the said Sy Quia, nor is\u00a0 there any proof to show that the plaintiffs Sy\u00a0 Joe\u00a0 Lieng and\u00a0 Sy Chua Niu have been\u00a0 continuously in possession of the legal status of children of the said Sy By Guit, and the said Sy Yoc Chay as the adopted child\u00a0 of\u00a0 Sy By Bo,\u00a0 and Sian Han as the grandchild of the\u00a0 said Sy By Bo, who, as well as Sy\u00a0 By Guit, is said to be the\u00a0 legitimate son of Sy\u00a0 Quia by his wife, Yap Puan Niu.<br\/><br\/>Further, there is no evidence to the effect\u00a0 that Sy\u00a0 Quia had ever provided for the support of Yap Puan Niu, nor that Petronila\u00a0 Encarnacion at any time delivered\u00a0 money,\u00a0 as alleged, to Sy Joe Lieng and Sy Yoc Chay by reason of their hereditary\u00a0 income,\u00a0 inasmuch\u00a0 as\u00a0 the delivery of the\u00a0 sum of ?4,000 to the said\u00a0 Sy\u00a0 Joe Lieng, entered in a book kept by Sy Tay, as per the\u00a0 copy of the entries appearing on page 300 of the book marked \"A.\u00a0 S.,\" is\u00a0 no proof of the\u00a0 payment of a part of the\u00a0 inheritance, and without any express declaration on the part of Petronila Encarnacion, an entry in a book kept by the firm 'of Sy Tay could not be binding upon the said Encarnacion, this, aside from the fact that the entries do not show the reason why this sum of P4,000 was charged to\u00a0 the account of Petronila Encarnacion and credited to Sy Joe Lieng; and, even if we admit as true the statement of the witness Emilio Medina that in his presence, the said Sy Joe Lieng received an additional sum of P2,000 from Petronila\u00a0 Encarnacion\u00a0 there\u00a0 is no evidence to show why this sum was paid to and received by the said Sy Joe Lieng;\u00a0 the witness himself said that the receipt made out at the time set\u00a0 forth that the\u00a0 money was for commercial purposes. \u00a0<br\/><br\/>It likewise appears from the record that the plaintiffs, who now seek to be recognized as\u00a0 the\u00a0 grandchildren, and Sian Han as the great-grandchild of the deceased Sy Quia, incidentally attempting to recover the property which the said Sy Quia left at the time of his death,\u00a0 have not shown by competent documentary proof that Sy By Bo and Sy By Guit were in fact the children of Sy Quia by his wife Yap Puan Niu; that Sy Yoc Lieng and Sy Chua Niu are the children of Sy By Guit; that Sy Yoc Chay is the adopted child\u00a0 of Sy By Bo, and Sian Han the son of Sy Jui Niu, who was the daughter of the said Sy By Bo, for the parentage and affiliation of the said parties,\u00a0 as well as\u00a0 the marriage of Sy By\u00a0 Bo and Sy By Guit,\u00a0 the\u00a0 adoption of Sy Yoc Chay,\u00a0 and the marriage of Sy Jui Niu, should have been established\u00a0 by means of the documents in which such facts\u00a0 are customarily recorded, as stated by Sy Hien, one of the witnesses\u00a0 for the plaintiffs and who also was alleged to be a brother\u00a0 of Sy\u00a0 Quia; the testimony of witnesses, the most dangerous and risky of evidence, not being sufficient to sustain\u00a0 a finding that the court erred in its estimation of\u00a0 the facts, since\u00a0 the preponderance of the evidence must be fixed precisely\u00a0 where the judge believes the truth lies, taking into\u00a0 consideration the facts which were sought to be established,\u00a0 together with the nature of\u00a0 the\u00a0 same and the circumstances of the case; and it should be noted that for the lack of documentary evidence it is impossible to determine on what date Sy Quia was actually married, if he was married at all, to Yap Puan Niu; and\u00a0 considering as a\u00a0 whole the evidence introduced by the\u00a0 plaintiffs as to the stay and residence of\u00a0 the said Sy\u00a0 Quia in the city of Vigan, Philippine Islands, during the three or four years when it is alleged he was at Amoy and there married, it can not be said that the preponderance of the evidence lies with the plaintiffs.<br\/><br\/>It further appears\u00a0 from the record that while\u00a0 the\u00a0 body of the deceased\u00a0 Vicente Romero Sy\u00a0 Quia\u00a0 was\u00a0 lying in state\u00a0 at the house\u00a0 where he died, in\u00a0 January, 1894, for the purpose of performing the ceremony of\u00a0 robing a descendant of the deceased\u00a0 with the nine silk suits which had been prepared for the corpse in accordance with the Chinese custom, and although Sy Hien, a brother of the\u00a0 deceased, was\u00a0 in charge\u00a0 of the ceremonies, it did not occur\u00a0 to him to dress Sy Yoc Chay in\u00a0 these garments, he, Sy Yoc Chay, being the\u00a0 son of By By Bo, and if the said Sy Hien thought that this would not be proper for the reason that Sy Yoc Chay was merely an adopted son, it is significant that Sy Joe Lieng, who was also present or at least in the house, was not dressed in\u00a0 the said nine suits, but the same were worn by Tomas Sy Quia, the eldest son of Gregorio, who for this purpose was expressly taken out of the\u00a0 college where he\u00a0 was\u00a0 at the time, as testified to by\u00a0 several witnesses, among\u00a0 them Macario Pavila, a\u00a0 resident merchant of Pangasinan, who chanced to be at the house\u00a0 on\u00a0 that occasion.\u00a0 The\u00a0 statement of Sy Hien to the effect that he did not remember\u00a0 the said ceremony,\u00a0 is not worthy of credit in view of the\u00a0 positive testimony of the defendants Pedro and Juan and of the witness Pavila, who, together with several Chinese, among them Sy Yoc Chay and Sy Joe Lieng, witnessed the same.\u00a0 The latter's statement\u00a0 that he was not present at the ceremony on account of his\u00a0 having temporarily left the house in order to carry out certain instructions received by him, can not be believed, for,\u00a0 if it is a fact that he was the proper person to wear the said nine\u00a0 silk\u00a0 suits according to the customs of his\u00a0 country, the master of the ceremonies would have suspended the same until he,\u00a0 Sy Joe Lieng, returned to the\u00a0 house; but instead\u00a0 of this the eldest son of Gregorio Sy Quia was brought, it is alleged, from the\u00a0 college where he was, his father Gregorio being at the time in Vigan, for the investiture of the nine robes before they were placed upon the corpse.\u00a0 From\u00a0 all this\u00a0 it may\u00a0 be inferred that Sy Yoc Chay, who denied that the said ceremony took place, and Sy Joe Lieng, were not,\u00a0 as a matter of fact, the grandsons of\u00a0 Sy Quia, as Sy Hien,\u00a0 a brother\u00a0 of the deceased, who conducted\u00a0 the ceremony well knew, and\u00a0 that the only descendant to be\u00a0 designated in accordance with\u00a0 traditional customs\u00a0 of the\u00a0 Chinese\u00a0 was Gregorio Sy Quia, the eldest son of the deceased, and, in his absence,\u00a0 the latter's eldest son, Tomas Sy Quia,\u00a0 which\u00a0 designation was\u00a0 accordingly made.<br\/><br\/>In\u00a0 addition to the foregoing considerations it should be stated that the sworn statement by\u00a0 Vicente Romero Sy Quia\u00a0 before the civil and ecclesiastical authorities of the city of Vigan in the proceedings which were instituted in 1853 in connection with his marriage in the parish church of that city, the continued possession for\u00a0 a period of many years of the status of a single man enjoyed by\u00a0 him and recognized and\u00a0 accepted by the\u00a0 whole community of the capital of\u00a0 the\u00a0 Province\u00a0 of Ilocos Sur, the belief on the part of his townsmen and neighbors that he was in fact a single\u00a0 man, all these facts being corroborated, as they are, by the uniform testimony of the witnesses for the defendants, and the\u00a0 unexplained silence on the part of his alleged wife, Yap Puan\u00a0 Niu, who might have\u00a0 asserted Whatever rights she may have had as the legitimate wife of Sy\u00a0 Quia before the tribunals of this country, if she reafty had\u00a0 any,\u00a0 completely overcome and destroy the improvised\u00a0 parol\u00a0 evidence\u00a0 as to the\u00a0 pretended marriage of Sy Quia in China, the performance of which was for the first time alleged in December, 1905, after Sy Quia's death and\u00a0 the\u00a0 demise\u00a0 of the latter's brother, Joaquin Martinez Sy\u00a0 Tiong Tay,\u00a0 who, having\u00a0 sheltered in his house\u00a0 the woman\u00a0 Yap Puan Niu on the two occasions aforesaid, as well as the plaintiffs Sy Yoc Chay and Sy Joe Lieng since these latter landed in the Philippines, might\u00a0 have testified to the existence of the marriage, thus supporting the plaintiff's claim to the Sy Quia estate.<br\/><br\/>It is admitted by the plaintiffs in this case that\u00a0 two of them, Sy Yoc Chay and\u00a0 Sy Joe Lieng, and the woman Yap Puan\u00a0 Niu,\u00a0 when they\u00a0 came to this country stopped at the house of\u00a0 the said Sy Tiong Tay, who provided for their support\u00a0 and maintenance, gave\u00a0 employment\u00a0 to\u00a0 the first two in his own\u00a0 business and paid for the transportation\u00a0 of the woman to Manila and back to China on the two occasions when\u00a0 she\u00a0 came to this\u00a0 country;\u00a0 and, notwithstanding the truth and certainty of these facts,\u00a0 the plaintiffs, nevertheless,\u00a0 did not even endeavor to\u00a0 show that the said Sy\u00a0 Tiong Tay\u00a0 had defrayed\u00a0 all these expenses by order and on account of his\u00a0 brother Sy Quia, a fact which would appear\u00a0 from the entries in the books kept by him as a merchant, if such payments were really made in behalf of\u00a0 the said Sy\u00a0 Quia.\u00a0 The plaintiffs\u00a0 introduced\u00a0 in evidence a certain book\u00a0 alleged to\u00a0 belong\u00a0 to the firm\u00a0 of Sy Tay\u00a0 for the purpose of establishing a certain payment made by Petronila Encarnacion to the said plaintiffs.\u00a0 They, however, were unable to produce any book to show that the expenses incurred by the\u00a0 said Sy Tay for the maintenance\u00a0 and support of the said plaintiffs and of the woman, Yap Puan Niu,\u00a0 as well as the latter's traveling expenses were paid by and on account of\u00a0 Sy Quia.<br\/><br\/>They\u00a0 were unable to explain\u00a0 the\u00a0 reason for\u00a0 these disbursements made by Sy Tay for the benefit of two of the plaintiffs and their alleged grandmother, notwithstanding the\u00a0 fact that\u00a0 death had\u00a0 forever\u00a0 stilled the lips\u00a0 of\u00a0 the two\u00a0 brothers, Sy Tay and Sy\u00a0 Quia, plaintiffs having confined themselves to attributing to him whom they believed to be the wealthier of the two brothers, who unfortunately can not now speak, the paternity and parentage of a family which is not proved to be his.<br\/><br\/>This court,\u00a0 in the strictest administration of justice and in conformity with the law, can not admit that plaintiffs have proved four marriages and three generations,\u00a0 since the evidence introduced by them in\u00a0 support of these\u00a0 facts only consists of the testimony of witnesses, most of whom have made conflicting statements and some have contradicted themselves, as for instance the brother of Sy Quia, Sy Hien, whose testimony is absolutely\u00a0 unworthy of\u00a0 credence, and other witnesses have told improbable stories and testified\u00a0 as to things\u00a0 which are not likely to occur in the natural and ordinary course of human events.<br\/><br\/>Even assuming that Sy Quia before he became a Christian actually\u00a0 married Yap Puan\u00a0 Niu in 1847, as alleged,\u00a0 and that his second marriage in 1853 with a Christian woman, by whom he had five children and with whom he lived cotentedly\u00a0 in these Islands since the marriage until\u00a0 he\u00a0 died, covering a period of forty-one years, while the first marriage was still in full force and effect, was null and void, he, Vicente Romero Sy Quia, having therefore married twice in violation of the\u00a0 law, the plaintiffs, nevertheless, would not be entitled to the relief sought by them in their complaint.<br\/><br\/>There\u00a0 is not the\u00a0 slightest evidence in the record which even tends to indicate that\u00a0 Sy\u00a0 Quia, at\u00a0 the time of his marriage\u00a0 at Vigan in 1853\u00a0 with Petronila Encaraacion, brought any property or money\u00a0 into the conjugal partnership.\u00a0\u00a0 The fact\u00a0 that\u00a0 he did\u00a0 not is not surprising, as he was then a mere clerk in the employment of another Chinaman by the name of Jose Gloria, who was a resident of this city, with a salary of P200 per annum, as per the testimony of Silveria Damian, an aged woman, whose husband\u00a0 was also a\u00a0 Chinaman and worked for the same man that Sy Quia did and for the same salary; while, on the other hand, there is evidence in the record to the effect that Petronila Encarnacion, who belonged to a\u00a0 wealthy family of Vigan, brought to the marriage, as a gift from her parents, the sum of P5,000, which, together\u00a0 with their common labor and industry, was the basis of the fortune accumulated by both husband and wife in the course of years.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, even assuming that the second marriage which was contracted by Sy Quia at Vigan\u00a0 was void, while a former marriage alleged to have\u00a0 been performed at Amoy, China,\u00a0 was still\u00a0 in full force and effect, and upon\u00a0 which the plaintiffs in this case base their contention, the second marriage, however,\u00a0 produced civil effects\u00a0 under the laws here in force in 1853, the time\u00a0 when\u00a0 it\u00a0 was performed. These laws are as follows:<br\/><br\/>Law\u00a0 3, title 3, Partida 4, provides\u00a0 in part as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Further, if people marry advisably,\u00a0 knowing that such impediment existed, and that for this reason they should not have married, the children which\u00a0 may be born will not be legitimate;\u00a0 but if only one of the contracting parties, and not both, was cognizant of the\u00a0 existence of such impediment, the children will be legitimate, for the ignorance of one of the contracting parties\u00a0 excuses them, and no one can say that they are not legitimate children.\"<\/blockquote>Law 1, title 13, <i>Partida <\/i>4, provides in part as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"And even if it should happen that between those who are married manifestly in <i>facie\u00a0 ecclesia<\/i> such impediment exists which would require that the marriage be set aside, the children which may\u00a0 be born to\u00a0 them\u00a0 before the contracting parties\u00a0 knew that the\u00a0 impediment existed, will be legitimate.\u00a0\u00a0 And\u00a0 this\u00a0 would also be\u00a0 the case\u00a0 if neither of the contracting parties knew that the impediment existed, as well\u00a0 as if only one\u00a0 of them had knowledge thereof, for the ignorance on the part of one of them would make the children legitimate.\u00a0 But\u00a0 if after knowing with\u00a0 certainty that the impediment existed between them, they should have children, any that should\u00a0 be born subsequent thereto will not be legitimate.\u00a0 But,\u00a0 if\u00a0 while such\u00a0 impediment\u00a0 exists without the knowledge of both parties or of either of them, they should be accused before the judges of the Holy Church, and before the impediment is\u00a0 duly established and final judgment entered, children be born to them, such children as may be born while the doubt exists,\u00a0 will be legitimate.\"<\/blockquote>The Civil Code has merely reproduced with certain modifications the provisions of the old legislation in force in 1853 as to the civil effects of a void marriage where\u00a0 both parties married in good faith,\u00a0 as well as where only one of them acted in good faith,\u00a0 for\u00a0 whether one or both married\u00a0 in good\u00a0 faith, the\u00a0 marriage will produce civil effects only\u00a0 in favor of the innocent spouse, and of the children born\u00a0 of this void marriage.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<br\/><br\/>If in all the\u00a0 acts of life good\u00a0 faith is\u00a0 to be presumed unless the contrary is\u00a0 proven,\u00a0 it can\u00a0 not\u00a0 be\u00a0 denied that Petronila Encarnacion acted in good faith when she married Vicente Romero Sy Quia in 1853, since there is no evidence in the record to the\u00a0 effect that she knew before or after her marriage that the said Vicente Romero Sy\u00a0 Quia was married in China to another woman.<br\/><br\/>The marriage contracted by a Christian\u00a0 Chinese\u00a0 at the time when Sy\u00a0 Quia was\u00a0 married in the\u00a0 Philippines, was preceded by\u00a0 such formalities, and so many requisites had first to be complied with, that\u00a0 it\u00a0 was difficult, not to say impossible, that in the natural and ordinary course of things the marriage could have been performed if there were any impediment at all thereto.\u00a0\u00a0 In\u00a0 the case of Sy\u00a0 Quia, not only for many years was he considered in the city of\u00a0 Vigan by the community at large as a bachelor, his name appearing as such in the municipal census, but it must be\u00a0 fairly assumed that when he instituted the proceedings before the civil authorities, and ecclesiastical proceedings in the ecclesiastical court of Vigan, in order to secure permission and authority to marry in accordance with the various decrees then in force, among them the\u00a0 decree of the 20th of December, 1849, he must\u00a0 have positively\u00a0 said then that he was a bachelor, and this fact must have appeared from the summary investigation conducted by\u00a0 the ecclesiastical authorities of Vigan for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not he was a bachelor and free to marry, and when at last the parish priest of Vigan was authorized to proceed with the marriage ceremony, there is little room for doubt that Petronila Encarnacion, as well as her family, relying upon the result of both\u00a0 proceedings, and\u00a0 upon the\u00a0 license\u00a0 or authority granted\u00a0 by the government,\u00a0 and the authority given by the vicar general in\u00a0 the name of the bishop, for the performance of the marriage, they consented thereto in the best of good faith, particularly Petronila Encarnacion, to the latter's union to Vicente Romero Sy Quia in lawful wedlock.<br\/><br\/>If, on the contrary, it were true that Sy Quia had married in\u00a0 China many years\u00a0 before, there is no doubt that he acted in bad faith by deceiving his wife Petronila Encarnacion, as well as the civil and ecclesiastical authorities of this country, perjuring himself.\u00a0\u00a0 And upon the assumption that the marriage with Petronila Encarnacion was void by reason of the existence of a prior undissolved\u00a0 marriage, the second marriage, nevertheless, produced its civil\u00a0 effects in\u00a0 favor of the deceived spouse, and\u00a0 of the children born to\u00a0 them, who, notwithstanding the nullity of the second\u00a0 marriage, are in\u00a0 the eyes of the law legitimate, as though they had been born of parents lawfully married.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, assuming that Vicente Romero Sy Quia acted in bad faith\u00a0 by concealing the fact of\u00a0 his first marriage at the investigation made by the authorities for the purpose of determining\u00a0 whether or not he was a\u00a0 bachelor and free to marry, one of the civil effects\u00a0 produced by the marriage thus rendered void was that Sy Quia thereby absolutely forfeited all his rights and interest to\u00a0 one-half of the conjugal\u00a0 property appearing in the instrument of partition, Exhibit A. F.,\u00a0 and\u00a0 by operation\u00a0 of law\u00a0 all the property which\u00a0 would otherwise have belonged to\u00a0 him, became the property of his wife, Petronila\u00a0 Encarnacion,\" in\u00a0 accordance with the provisions of the Civil Code applicable to the case in conformity with rule 3\u00a0 of the transitory provisions.<br\/><br\/>Law 16, title 17, Partida 7, with reference to this subject, provides:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/><blockquote>\"Notorious wickedness is committed by men who knowingly marry\u00a0 twice while their first wife is living, and the same may be said\u00a0 of women who marry twice knowing that their first husband\u00a0 is still alive.\u00a0\u00a0 Because such marriages give offense to God, and bring about great damages and dishonor to those who are deceived, and they should be careful to marry well and properly, as directed by the holy Church, for they would otherwise be married to persons with whom they would later live in sin, and while they endeavor to be happy in their marriage, and have children, the first wife or first husband appears when least expected, and disrupts\u00a0 the marriage, and on account of this rupture many women are dishonored and ruined forever, and men are disgraced in many ways.\u00a0 We therefore command that everyone who should knowingly enter into such a marriage, in any\u00a0 of the manners specified in\u00a0 this law, be hence banished to some island for five years, and that he forfeit whatever\u00a0 he\u00a0 may own\u00a0 at the place\u00a0 where the marriage was performed, and\u00a0 that it be given to his children or his grandchildren,\u00a0 if he has\u00a0 any, and if\u00a0 he has no children or grandchildren, one-half of such property\u00a0 should go to the person deceived,\u00a0 and the other half to the king's chamber ; and if both parties knew that one of them was married, and wilfully\u00a0 married him or her, then both\u00a0 shall be banished, each to a separate\u00a0 island, and the property of either of them who\u00a0 may have no children should go to the king's chamber.\"<\/blockquote>Article\u00a0 1417\u00a0 of the Civil Code provides as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"The\u00a0 conjugal partnership expires on\u00a0 the dissolution of the marriage or when it\u00a0 is declared void.<br\/><br\/>\"The\u00a0 spouse\u00a0 who, by\u00a0 reason of\u00a0 his or\u00a0 her bad faith, caused the annulment, shall not receive any\u00a0 share of\u00a0 the property of the partnership.\"<\/blockquote>This\u00a0 article embodies and\u00a0 reproduces under\u00a0 different aspects the provisions contained in articles\u00a0 72, 1333, subsection\u00a0 3,\u00a0 1373, 1378, and\u00a0 1429 of the same code, and\u00a0 a mere reading of this article, together with\u00a0 the provisions of law 16 of the <i>Partidas<\/i> above quoted, will show the difference between the two.\u00a0 It will be noticed that the code contains more\u00a0 favorable and less\u00a0 strict provisions on this subject than the\u00a0 law of the <i>Partidas<\/i>, wherefore, in accordance with\u00a0 rule 3\u00a0 of the transitory\u00a0 provisions of the said code,\u00a0 the intestate succession\u00a0 of the deceased Vicente Romero Sy Quia should be\u00a0 governed and regulated by the new code,\u00a0 which\u00a0 was\u00a0 in force on January 9,\u00a0 1894,\u00a0 the date of Sy Quia's death.<br\/><br\/>True,\u00a0 article 72 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 said code is included in title 4, the application and enforcement of which in these Islands was suspended\u00a0 under the former sovereignty;\u00a0 but there is no doubt that article 1417 and\u00a0 the other sections cited are\u00a0 now in\u00a0 force, said article 1417 providing\u00a0 that\u00a0 the spouse who by reason\u00a0 of his or her bad faith causes the annulment of the marriage, shall not\u00a0 receive any\u00a0 share of the property of the conjugal partnership.<br\/><br\/>It should be\u00a0 borne\u00a0 in mind that\u00a0 on account of the unexplained silence of Yap\u00a0 Puan Niu\u00a0 during her lifetime, and the silence of the plaintiffs during Sy\u00a0 Quia's lifetime, the conjugal partnership\u00a0 constituted in 1853 between Sy Quia and Petronila\u00a0 Encarnacion was dissolved in 1894 by the death of the husband, and only then, when the Civil Code was already in operation, would\u00a0 their\u00a0 presumptive heirs have acquired a right to claim the inheritance, for the right to inherit\u00a0 while the\u00a0 deceased\u00a0 was still\u00a0 living is a mere right in expectancy,\u00a0 and not\u00a0 until\u00a0 after the decease of the person whose succession is\u00a0 in concern can such a right be said to\u00a0 exist or to be duly acquired.\u00a0\u00a0 See the preamble to the Civil Code and the doctrine laid down by the supreme court of Spain on the subject in its judgment of the 24th of June, 1897, wherein the\u00a0 court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"That upon the settlement and distribution of the estate of a person who dies subsequent to the\u00a0 promulgation of the Civil Code, any action for the recovery of the property of the estate\u00a0 should be governed by the\u00a0 provisions of the said code,\u00a0 in conformity with\u00a0 the first rule\u00a0 and the one preceding the last,\u00a0 of the\u00a0 transitory provisions, because the rule as to the nonretroactivity of the new law only applies to rights acquired under the former legislation;\u00a0 and it is a well-known fact that hereditary rights exist only after the demise of the decedent;\u00a0 and the trial court having so decided, it did not infringe the\u00a0 provisions of laws 11 ancf 12, title 13, Partida 6, and the general provision\u00a0 of the transitory\u00a0 rules for the\u00a0 application\u00a0 of the Civil Code.\"<\/blockquote>However,\u00a0 as\u00a0 a matter of\u00a0 fact the action\u00a0 instituted by plaintiffs in 1905,\u00a0 claiming the property\u00a0 left by Sy\u00a0 Quia at the time of his death, is based especially upon the alleged nullity of the second marriage on account of the existence of the former performed in China.\u00a0 Therefore,\u00a0 the rights claimed by the\u00a0 plaintiffs should\u00a0 be determined\u00a0 in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Code which has been in operation since 1889 and\u00a0 under which the rights now asserted\u00a0 by the plaintiffs\u00a0 might\u00a0 have sprung\u00a0 and\u00a0 been acquired\u00a0 by them,\u00a0 this\u00a0 assuming\u00a0 that the\u00a0 alleged\u00a0 first marriage was actually performed in China and that the claimants were in\u00a0 fact the\u00a0 issue of the said\u00a0 pretended marriage of Sy Quia\u00a0 and\u00a0 Yap Puan Niu.<br\/><br\/>Since the 9th of\u00a0 June, 1853, when Vicente Romero\u00a0 Sy Quia married Petronila Encarnacion, the conjugal partnership commenced to exist between the two spouses.\u00a0 All the property\u00a0 acquired by\u00a0 them up to the time of the dissolution of the said partnership\u00a0 on\u00a0 account of the death of Sy Quia on January 9, 1894,\u00a0 belonged to this partnership. (Law 1, title 3, of the Fuero Real; laws 1, 3 and 4,\u00a0 title 4, book 10,\u00a0 of the<i> Novisima Recopilacion;<\/i> and arts.\u00a0 1393, 1401, 1403-1407, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>During Sy Quia's lifetime\u00a0 the validity of his marriage with Petronila Encarnacion,\u00a0 as has been said before, was never questioned, no one having indicated any defect which rendered the same void.\u00a0\u00a0 It was only afterJus^death that the plaintiffs ventured to attack the validity of the same by claiming that they were his legitimate\u00a0 heirs\u00a0 and as such entitled to his estate.<br\/><br\/>The Laws of the <i>Partidas <\/i>above cited, as well as the Civil Code, both recognize as a fact that a marriage contracted in\u00a0 good faith,\u00a0 by one at least of the parties\u00a0 to the same, produces the same\u00a0 civil\u00a0 effects\u00a0 as a valid marriage with reference to the innocent spouse and the children born of such marriage,\u00a0 even though the same be subsequently declared null and void.<br\/><br\/>It can not be denied that Petronila Encarnacion married Sy Quia in the best of good faith, there being not the slightest proof to the contrary so far as the\u00a0 record shows.\u00a0 Therefore, being innocent, she must\u00a0 be held to have acquired all the\u00a0 rights to which a wife is ordinarily entitled,\u00a0 and neither\u00a0 she\u00a0 nor her children can be made\u00a0 to suffer the consequences of the nullity of such marriage, this, assuming that the\u00a0 marriage was void;\u00a0 nor\u00a0 can they in any event be\u00a0 made to\u00a0 suffer the consequences of the bad\u00a0 faith of her husband Sy Quia.<br\/><br\/>The nullity of the marriage, once declared by the courts, may\u00a0 deprive the partnership created by the\u00a0 marriage of the alleged spouses of its\u00a0 otherwise legal character, but can not destroy the legal consequences of the marital union while it existed.\u00a0 Consequently the children are considered legitimate, and\u00a0 the\u00a0 innocent\u00a0 spouse\u00a0 is unquestionably entitled to one-half of the conjugal property acquired during the marriage.<br\/><br\/>From the legal provisions above cited, especially the sections of the\u00a0 Civil Code referred to,\u00a0 it necessarily follows that the half of the conjugal property to which Vicente Romero Sy Quia would have been otherwise entitled, on account of the\u00a0 alleged nullity of his\u00a0 marriage with Petronila Encarnacion and of\u00a0 his\u00a0 bad faith\u00a0 in contracting the same, was forfeited by him and\u00a0 by\u00a0 operation\u00a0 of the\u00a0 law passed to the other spouse, Encarnacion; and the plaintiffs, in their alleged capacity\u00a0 as legitimate descendants of the said Sy Quia,\u00a0 deceased, can not now claim the said property, as\u00a0 the decedent, by the express provisions of the law, absolutely forfeited\u00a0 his right to the said half of the property acquired during\u00a0 the\u00a0 marriage.\u00a0 Such marriage must be\u00a0 considered null\u00a0 and void if it is true, as alleged by the\u00a0 plaintiffs, that Sy Quia's marriage with Yap Puan Niu was still in full force and effect when he married Petronila\u00a0 Encarnacion.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for\u00a0 plaintiffs now ask this court to modify the judgment appealed from and to declare that the said plaintiffs are\u00a0 the only legitimate heirs of Sy Quia and consequently entitled to his entire estate, together with all rents and profits, for which judgment should be entered in their favor with costs.\u00a0 In support of their contention they have assigned\u00a0 various errors as committed by the\u00a0 trial court, among them that the court erred in finding as a conclusion of law that the said Sy Quia was a subject of the Chinese Empire\u00a0 and that his estate should\u00a0 be distributed in accordance with the laws of China.<br\/><br\/>It is\u00a0 an admitted fact that Sy Quia was a native Chinaman and therefore a foreigner; that he came to this country in 1839 or 1840, when he was 12 years of age.\u00a0 He having resided\u00a0 in these Islands since then and until January, 1894, when he died, that is to say, for a period of more than 53 years, having obtained for this purpose the necessary license or permission,\u00a0 and having\u00a0 been converted to the Catholic religion, marrying a native woman in the city of Vigan and establishing\u00a0 his domicile first\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 Province of Ilocos and later in this city of Manila, with the intention of residing here permanently, engaging in business generally and acquiring real estate, it is unquestionable that by virtue of all these acts he acquired\u00a0 a residence and became definitely domiciled in these Islands with the\u00a0 same rights as any nationalized citizen in accordance\u00a0 with the\u00a0 laws in force in these Islands while he lived here and until his death.<br\/><br\/>It should be noticed that, as the laws have no retroactive effect, in\u00a0 order to determine what rights Sy Quia had actually acquired\u00a0 since he removed to the Philippines in 1839 or 1840, it will be necessary to resort to the laws in force at that time; and the provisions of the Civil Code promulgated in November, 1889, could not affect in the least rights thus acquired by virtue of his\u00a0 long residence\u00a0 in these Islands.\u00a0\u00a0 Article 3 of the Civil Code is as follows:\u00a0 \"Laws shall not have retroactive effect unless\u00a0 otherwise prescribed therein.\"\u00a0 This provision is in\u00a0 accordance with the provisions ofiaw 15, title 14, <i>Partida<\/i> 3.<br\/><br\/>The legislation then in force on the subject of naturalization and residence of foreigners in\u00a0 the\u00a0 Philippine Islands will be found in the following laws.\u00a0\u00a0 Law 1, title 11, book 6 of the <i>Novisima Recopilacion<\/i>, is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"We permit that the subjects of other kingdoms (provided they are Catholics and friendly to our\u00a0 Crown)\u00a0 who\u00a0 may desire\u00a0 to come here to practice their trade or profession may do so, and we command that if they do now practice some trade\u00a0 or profession\u00a0 and live twenty leagues\u00a0 inland from any port, they\u00a0 shall be forever exempt from the\u00a0 payment of taxes, and shall be likewise exempt,\u00a0 for a\u00a0 period of six years,\u00a0 from\u00a0 the payment of municipal taxes and from the\u00a0 performance\u00a0 of\u00a0 any\u00a0 ordinary\u00a0 or extraordinary services, as\u00a0 well as from holding office as members of municipal councils at the\u00a0 place\u00a0 where\u00a0 they may\u00a0 reside; and they, like other\u00a0 residents,\u00a0 shall be permitted to use\u00a0 the common pastures and\u00a0 enjoy all the\u00a0 privileges\u00a0 accorded to the latter: and we hereby command the authorities to provide them with house and\u00a0 lands, if necessary.\u00a0\u00a0 And other foreigners, whether they have any trade or profession, <i><i>provided\u00a0 they have lived in this kingdom for a period\u00a0 of ten years<\/i><\/i>\u00a0 in a home\u00a0 of\u00a0 their own,\u00a0 and\u00a0 have been married to native women for a period of six years, shall be admitted to all the offices of the republic except to\u00a0 those of magistrate, governor, mayor,\u00a0 alderman, warden, treasurer, revenue collector,\u00a0 secretary of city council, or any\u00a0 other government position of trust.\u00a0 As to these latter offices, as well as to all ecclesiastical offices,\u00a0 all\u00a0 existing laws shall continue in full force and effect, etc.\"<\/blockquote>And law 3 of the same title and book of the <i>Novisima Recopilacion <\/i>provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"There shall be considered as denizens, in the first place. all foreigners who obtain the privilege of naturalization and those who are born in these kingdoms; those who residing therein may be converted to our holy Catholic faith; those who, being self-supporting, establish their domicile therein; those who ask for and obtain residence in any town thereof; those who marry\u00a0 a native woman of the said kingdoms and are domiciled therein; and in the case of a foreign woman who marries a native man, she thereby becomes subject to the same laws and acquires the same domicile as her husband; those who\u00a0 establish\u00a0 themselves in the country by acquiring real property; those who have a trade or profession and go there to practice the\u00a0 same; also those who practice some mechanical\u00a0 trade therein\u00a0 or keep a\u00a0 retail store; those who hold public or honorary offices or any such position whatsoever\u00a0 which\u00a0 can\u00a0 only be\u00a0 held by natives; those who enjoy the\u00a0 privilege of the common pastures and other privileges usually accorded to\u00a0 other residents; those who shall reside in the said kingdoms for a period of ten years in a home\u00a0 of\u00a0 their own;\u00a0 and also\u00a0 those foreigners who, in accordance with the common law, royal orders and other laws\u00a0 of the kingdoms, may have become naturalized or acquired residence therein, they being obliged to pay the same taxes as the natives\u00a0 for the legal\u00a0 and fundamental reason that they also participate in their privileges, etc.\"<\/blockquote>Article 18 of the\u00a0 Code\u00a0 of Commerce of\u00a0 May 30,\u00a0 1829, which was\u00a0 in operation until 1888, is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Foreigners who have become naturalized or\u00a0 have acquired residence in Spain in the manner provided by\u00a0 law may freely engage in commerce with the same rights\u00a0 and under the same conditions as natives of the kingdom.\"<\/blockquote>Although the royal decree of the 17th of November, 1852, was not extended to the\u00a0 colonies, with\u00a0 the exception of section\u00a0 28 thereof, nevertheless, it\u00a0 is\u00a0 only\u00a0 proper to\u00a0 call attention to the provisions of the said decree in so far as they have any bearing upon the case\u00a0 at bar,\u00a0 in view of the provisions of laws 1 and 2, title 1, book 2, of the Compilation of the Laws of the Indies, which direct that the laws of Castile shall be\u00a0 observed in all cases not otherwise covered by said laws.\u00a0 Section 2 of the said royal decree of 1852 is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Foreigners who\u00a0 have gained or obtained\u00a0 a residence, in accordance with\u00a0 the\u00a0 laws, shall be\u00a0 considered Spanish subjects.\"<\/blockquote>Section 3 provides that all other foreigners who reside in Spain without having taken out naturalization papers, or otherwise gained a residence therein, shall continue to be foreigners.\u00a0 And section 12 provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"Those persons shall\u00a0 not be legally considered as\u00a0 foreigners,\u00a0 under\u00a0 any\u00a0 circumstances, who\u00a0 have\u00a0 failed to register as such in the registry of transients or domiciled persons kept by the civil\u00a0 authorities of the provinces or with the consuls of the respective nations.\"<\/blockquote>It is a proven and undeniable fact that Sy Quia resided in the Philippines for more than fifty years, he having only absented himself occasionally\u00a0 for\u00a0 a short time\u00a0 with the intention of immediately returning to the Islands; and it is also\u00a0 a fact that in various documents and public instruments\u00a0 executed\u00a0 before notaries\u00a0 public, which have\u00a0 been introduced in evidence marked as\u00a0 \"Exhibits 1, 2, and 3,\" said Vicente Romero\u00a0 Sy Quia has uniformly stated that he was a resident of the district of Binondo, having declared in one of the said documents that he was a freeholder.\u00a0 If the Chinaman Vicente Romero Sy Quia on account of his continuous residence in these Islands for a\u00a0 period of more than fifty\u00a0 years, and by virtue\u00a0 of the fact that he\u00a0 had permanently established\u00a0 himself\u00a0 in\u00a0 this country, living in a house of his own, with his wife and children, and having acquired real estate therein, did become a domiciled denizen under the\u00a0 laws\u00a0 then\u00a0 in\u00a0 force,\u00a0 even if\u00a0 it be held that the royal decree of the 17th of November, 1852, was applicable to these Islands by virtue of the provision\u00a0 contained in the Laws of the Indies, the legal status of Vicente Romero Sy\u00a0 Quia has not changed,\u00a0 because the provisions of the said decree do not in any way affect the rights acquired by\u00a0 him; and\u00a0 the\u00a0 supreme court of Spain\u00a0 in\u00a0 a judgment of the 30th of April, 1861, in construing this provision of the law, declared\u00a0 and held that the purpose of the royal decree of the\u00a0 17th of November, 1852, was not to promulgate a new law, but merely to condense and embody in one single act the various provisions then in force with reference to foreigners, and to preserve the <i>fuero de extranjeria<\/i> (the rights which\u00a0 foreigners had in certain cases to invoke their own\u00a0 laws) in the same manner as it existed before. In\u00a0 another judgment of the 29th\u00a0 of August of the same year the said\u00a0 supreme court of Spain held that under the provisions of law 3, title 11, book 6, of the <i>Novisima Recopilacion<\/i>, there should be\u00a0 considered as domiciled denizens of Spain all foreigners who,\u00a0 being self-supporting, established their domicile in the country; the double inscription in the registry, as required by the royal\u00a0 decree of the\u00a0 17th of November,\u00a0 1852, being no obstacle thereto.<br\/><br\/>Many years prior\u00a0 to the promulgation\u00a0 of the Civil Code in these Islands, there was published in the Official Gazette of this city on September 18,\u00a0 1870, the decretal law of the 4th of July of\u00a0 the said year relating to foreigners,\u00a0 section 2 of which provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"Foreigners who, in accordance with the laws,\u00a0 shall become naturalized\u00a0 or\u00a0 gain residence in\u00a0 any town of\u00a0 the Spanish provinces beyond the seas, shall be considered as Spanish subjects.\"<\/blockquote>After dividing into three different classes the foreigners who should come into and establish themselves in the provinces beyond\u00a0 the\u00a0 seas,\u00a0 classifying them respectively\u00a0 as domiciled,\u00a0 transient,\u00a0 and immigrant foreigners,\u00a0 the\u00a0 said section provided that\u00a0 \"Domiciled foreigners are those\u00a0 who have a regular residence and have lived for three years in any province or who may have registered as such residents in the registry\u00a0 of domiciled, persons kept for this purpose,\" etc.<br\/><br\/>Section 7 of the said\u00a0 decree\u00a0 provides\u00a0 as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Any foreigner residing in the provinces beyond the seas, in order to be\u00a0 considered as such foreigner under the laws of the country, shall register in the registry of foreigners to be kept for this purpose\u00a0 by the civil supreme authorities and by the consuls of their respective nations.\"<\/blockquote>The above-quoted sections of the said decree are\u00a0 in harmony with similar sections contained in the decree of the 17th of November,\u00a0 1852,\u00a0 which,\u00a0 as has been said, was never extended to these Islands - with the exception\u00a0 of section\u00a0 28 thereof relating\u00a0 to the settlement of the estates of\u00a0 deceased\u00a0 foreigners.\u00a0 The doctrine\u00a0 laid\u00a0 down\u00a0 by the supreme court of Spain with reference to the interpretation\u00a0 and proper construction of\u00a0 the said\u00a0 decree\u00a0 is not, therefore,\u00a0 inconsistent with the provisions of the\u00a0 decree or law of 1870, also relating to foreigners.<br\/><br\/>True that prior\u00a0 to 1870 there existed\u00a0 in these\u00a0 Islands no\u00a0 registry of foreigners and that even the civil registry was not then in operation, the provisions of titles 4 and 12 of the Civil\u00a0 Code relating thereto having been suspended by\u00a0 telegraphic order of the 29th\u00a0 of December, 1889.\u00a0 It is also true that no registry was kept by the foreign consulates and that there was\u00a0 no Chinese consul here\u00a0 at that time.\u00a0 However, if the Chinaman\u00a0 By Quia Kad really intended to\u00a0 preserve his nationality and the\u00a0 protection\u00a0 of the laws of this country, he would have registered\u00a0 in the registry\u00a0 which\u00a0 was\u00a0 kept by the\u00a0 Government here after the publication in these Islands of the said decree of 1870; and\u00a0 under the\u00a0 theory of the\u00a0 law a foreigner,\u00a0 in order to have the right\u00a0 to invoke the laws of his\u00a0 own country, must register\u00a0 in the\u00a0 proper registries as such\u00a0 foreigner; if Sy Quia did not see fit to so register at any time prior to his death in\u00a0 1894,\u00a0 we must presume\u00a0 that he\u00a0 did not\u00a0 do\u00a0 so because\u00a0 he desired to, preserve\u00a0 the rights\u00a0 which he had acquired as a resident of Manila.<br\/><br\/>Continuous and permanent residence\u00a0 in the country for a period of years,\u00a0 and the rights\u00a0 thereby\u00a0 acquired as\u00a0 a denizen of any town,\u00a0 were always taken into consideration by the Spanish legislators\u00a0 in determining the\u00a0 rights of\u00a0 a foreigner residing: in Spanish territory.\u00a0\u00a0 The constitution of 1812 provides in section 5 that there shall be considered as Spanish subjects:<br\/><blockquote>\"2. Foreigners who have obtained from the cortes a certificate\u00a0 of naturalization;\u00a0 and,\u00a0 3. Those\u00a0 who\u00a0 have otherwise gained\u00a0 residence in accordance with the\u00a0 laws of the country\u00a0 and lived as such residents for a period of\u00a0 ten years in any town of\u00a0 the kingdom.\"<\/blockquote>A similar\u00a0 provision is contained in section 1 of the constitution of 1845, paragraph 4 of which\u00a0 is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Spanish subjects\u00a0 are those who, not having\u00a0 otherwise obtained a certificate of naturalization, have, nevertheless, gained residence in any town of the kingdom.\"<\/blockquote>It becomes necessary to refer to the Spanish laws which were applicable or in operation\u00a0 in\u00a0 these Islands at\u00a0 the time that\u00a0 Vicente Romero Sy Quia gained residence and acquired the status of a domiciled denizen of the municipality of Vigan and subsequently of this city of\u00a0 Manila, for the reason that they were the only laws regulating his personal rights.<br\/><br\/>In addition to what has been said for the purpose of demonstrating that Vicente Romero Sy Quia acquired the legal status\u00a0 of a domiciled resident\u00a0 of these Islands,\u00a0 we should not forget to say that the Chinese residents of these Islands under the former sovereignty, and particularly at the time that Sy Quia gained a residence in\u00a0 this Archipelago, were\u00a0 governed by the Laws of the Indies and other special laws, some\u00a0 of them quite ancient;\u00a0 although they had no consul or any other representative of the Chinese Government,\u00a0 they, nevertheless, had a gobernadorcillo who was\u00a0 elected by their\u00a0 most prominent citizens, subject to the approval of the Governor-General.\u00a0 They were governed by laws different from the general laws of the country and paid a tax different from that which was paid by the natives and foreigners,\u00a0 and, upon their landing for the purpose of establishing themselves in the Islands, they had to obtain what was known as a resident's license and secure passports and permits whenever they desired to\u00a0 leave the Islands, and\u00a0 not only had\u00a0 they to obtain such permission from the Government,\u00a0 but\u00a0 also from their native wife, if they\u00a0 were married.\u00a0 It should be noticed also that\u00a0 they were not permitted to land in Manila without first obtaining a permit from the Government,\u00a0 and that they had to state\u00a0 before the\u00a0 Chinese immigration authorities whether they came here as mere transients, or visitors for a period of three months, which could be extended\u00a0 if they really intended to establish themselves in the country.\u00a0 For this purpose certain proceedings were instituted before the immigrant was given the said\u00a0 resident's license.\u00a0\u00a0 This license entitled them to\u00a0 more liberty and privileges in their business journeys\u00a0 and excursions through the provinces than the other\u00a0 transients\u00a0 who merely had\u00a0 permission to\u00a0 stay here three months.\u00a0 All this may be verified by reference to the decrees\u00a0 of the 31st\u00a0 of August, 1839;\u00a0 16th of\u00a0 September, 1840; 13th of December, 1843; and 20th of December, 1849. <br\/><br\/>It should be\u00a0 noticed\u00a0 further that section 19 of the\u00a0 said decree of the 16th\u00a0 of September, 1840, provided that\u00a0 the children\u00a0 always follow\u00a0 the\u00a0 status of their father and pay the same taxes,\u00a0 except the children\u00a0 of Chinese,\u00a0 who, according to the\u00a0 decree of the\u00a0 2d of May,\u00a0 1786, were\u00a0 considered as\u00a0 Chinese <i>mestizos<\/i>.\u00a0 These decrees may be found in the work entitled\u00a0 <i>\"Legislacion Ultra Marina<\/i>,\"\u00a0 by Rodriguez San Pedro, vol. 2, pp. 471-483, and vol. 8, p. 401.<br\/><br\/>The foregoing will\u00a0 clearly show that Vicente Romero Sy Quia\u00a0 gained residence in these Islands under\u00a0 the laws of the <i>Novisima Recopilacion.<\/i>\u00a0 Therefore\u00a0 the\u00a0 questions raised by those who now claim to be his descendants should be decided in accordance with the laws in force in the Philippines to which\u00a0 Sy Quia submitted himself from the time he applied for a resident's license and abstained from\u00a0 registering in 1870 as a foreigner.\u00a0\u00a0 Most of the\u00a0 property left by him being real, the\u00a0 same is subject to\u00a0 the laws of\u00a0 the country in which\u00a0 it is located.<br\/><br\/>In support of what has been said with reference to\u00a0 the special laws governing\u00a0 in the Philippines\u00a0 concerning Chinese,\u00a0 we will cite the\u00a0 decision in a case where a Chinese Christian by the name of Bonifacio Lim Tuaco requested that the\u00a0 children of\u00a0 Chinese married\u00a0 to\u00a0 native\u00a0 women, whether pure natives or half-castes,\u00a0 pay the same taxes as their father and be permitted to wear the same costume as the latter up\u00a0 to the age\u00a0 of 25.\u00a0 The Spanish Government, inspired by the\u00a0 traditional spirit of the ancient special\u00a0 laws relating to\u00a0 Chinese residents\u00a0 in\u00a0 these Islands, after consulting various heads of departments and obtaining the opinion\u00a0 of the Philippine council, denied the said petition\u00a0 in a\u00a0 royal order of\u00a0 the 24th of February, 1880, which was communicated to the Governor-General of these Islands and published in the Official Gazette April 17, 1880.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiffs in this case have invoked certain provisions of the Chinese laws as one\u00a0 of the\u00a0 grounds of the action by them\u00a0 instituted and now contend that\u00a0 the\u00a0 estate\u00a0 of Vicente Romero\u00a0 Sy\u00a0 Quia, deceased, should be distributed in accordance with the laws of that\u00a0 country.\u00a0 Even disregarding the fact that the plaintiffs should have, but have not,\u00a0 alleged in their complaint, as one of the facts\u00a0 constituting their cause of action,\u00a0 the existence of a law\u00a0 passed and\u00a0 promulgated\u00a0 in\u00a0 China,\u00a0 the\u00a0 existence\u00a0 of which law, being foreign, should\u00a0 have been alleged in\u00a0 the complaint, the fact\u00a0 remains that there\u00a0 is absolutely no evidence\u00a0 in the record as to the existence of the Chinese laws referred to by plaintiffs in their subsequent pleadings, the evidence of this character introduced by them consisting of\u00a0 books or pamphlets\u00a0 written\u00a0 in\u00a0 Chinese characters and marked \"Exhibits AH, AI, AJ, and AK,\" which they claim\u00a0 contain a compilation of the laws of China, being useless and of no value.<br\/><br\/>It may be that they\u00a0 contain, as plaintiffs claim, the laws of China, but we have\u00a0 no Spanish translation of them, they being in the Chinese language, and written with characters which are absolutely unknown to this\u00a0 court and to the defendants.\u00a0 Further, the plaintiffs have not\u00a0 introduced expert testimony in the manner and form\u00a0 prescribed by section\u00a0 292\u00a0 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and, finally, there is no evidence that these four books or pamphlets were printed by authority of the Chinese Government or that they have been duly authenticated by the certificate of competent authorities\u00a0 or that they\u00a0 are properly sealed with the seal of the nation to which they belong.\u00a0 For this\" reason the said books or pamphlets\u00a0 can not, under any circumstances, be considered as documentary proof of the laws of China.<br\/><br\/>Section 300 of the Code of Civil Procedure reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Books printed\u00a0 or published under the authority\u00a0 of the United States, or of one of the States of the United States, or a foreign\u00a0 country, and purporting to\u00a0 contain statutes, codes, or other written law of such\u00a0 State\u00a0 or country, or proved to be\u00a0 commonly admitted in the tribunals of such State or country as evidence of the written law thereof, are admissible in\u00a0 the\u00a0 Philippine Islands\u00a0 as evidence of such law.\"<\/blockquote>Section 301 of the same code provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"A\u00a0 copy of the\u00a0 written law, or other public writing of any State or country, attested by the certificate of the officer having charge of the original,\u00a0 under\u00a0 the seal of the State or country, is\u00a0 admissible as evidence of such law or writing.\"<\/blockquote>Section 302 provides as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"The oral testimony of witnesses, skilled\u00a0 therein,\u00a0 is admissible as evidence of the unwritten\u00a0 law\u00a0 of the United States or of\u00a0 any\u00a0 State of the United\u00a0 States, or foreign country, as are also printed and published books of reports of decisions of the courts of the United States or of such State or country, or proved to be commonly admitted in such courts.\"<\/blockquote>The jurisprudence of American and Spanish tribunals is uniform on this subject.\u00a0 For the purposes of this decision however it\u00a0 will be sufficient to refer to the judgment of the supreme court of Spain of the 26th of May, 1887, wherein it is said:<br\/><blockquote>\"Whenever\u00a0 a foreign law is\u00a0 invoked in our tribunals, its existence must be\u00a0 satisfactorily established\u00a0 as any\u00a0 other fact.\"<\/blockquote>If the pamphlets or books, written in Chinese characters, do not satisfactorily establish the existence of certain Chinese laws invoked by the plaintiffs, not only because such pamphlets or books lack the aforesaid formalities and requisites, but\u00a0 further because\u00a0 there is\u00a0 no\u00a0 evidence as\u00a0 to the nature of the laws contained in those books or pamphlets and the subjects with which they deal; on the\u00a0 other hand, the two witnesses whose testimony was introduced for the purpose of establishing the authenticity of the laws which, according to the plaintiffs, are contained in the said books, were unable\u00a0 to say positively at least that the book\u00a0 marked Exhibit AH\u00a0 contains an exact copy of the original.\u00a0 And the Chinese\u00a0 consul of this city, Sy\u00a0 Int Chu, after stating that he had never made a regular study of\u00a0 the laws of his country, simply consulting the same in connection with his official reports, admitted that he had never read or seen the original copy of this\u00a0 alleged compilation,\u00a0 the\u00a0 books not being duly certified, adding that he\u00a0 could not say whether the book marked \"Exhibit AH\" was an exact copy of the original.<br\/><br\/>The testimony of the witness\u00a0 Ly Ung Bing, the interpreter, as to\u00a0 the written and unwritten laws of China, does not show, as required by the Code of Civil Procedure, that he knew such\u00a0 laws or\u00a0 that\u00a0 he was acquainted\u00a0 with the nature of the laws alleged to be contained in the said books. He merely confined himself to expressing his own\u00a0 opinion with reference to\u00a0 the two classes of laws.\u00a0 He, not being an expert on the\u00a0 subject thoroughly conversant with the laws of China,\u00a0 his testimony, considering\u00a0 the manner in which\u00a0 he testified, can not even be\u00a0 accepted as\u00a0 partial evidence that the said four books really contain\u00a0 the written and unwritten laws of China.<br\/><br\/>From the foregoing facts and provisions of law referred to we conclude:<br\/><br\/>First. That it has not been\u00a0 duly established in this case that the Chinaman Sy Quia, married in 1847 at Am Thau, Amoy, China,\u00a0 the woman Yap\u00a0 Puan Niu, or\u00a0 that\u00a0 the plaintiffs are the descendants of the said\u00a0 Sy Quia, for the reason that the marriage of Sy\u00a0 By Bo, Sy By Guit and Sy Jui Niu, respectively,\u00a0 the affiliation\u00a0 and parentage of the latter and of Sy Chua Niu and\u00a0 Sian Han, and the adoption of Sy Yoc Chay have not been proven.<br\/><br\/>Second.\u00a0 That, even assuming that Sy Quia actually married Yap Puan Niu in\u00a0 1847, and that the second marriage with Petronila Encarnacion in\u00a0 1853 is, therefore, void, Sy Quia having contracted this second marriage in bad\u00a0 faith by concealing the fact that his former wife was still living, his half of the property of the conjugal partnership between him and his second wife, who married him in good faith, was forfeited by operation\u00a0 of law in favor of his said second wife, for although the law recognizes civil effects to a void marriage, it, nevertheless, deprives the party who married in bad faith of his share\u00a0 in the community property acquired during the existence of the marriage\u00a0 up to the time of its\u00a0 annulment.<br\/><br\/>Third. That, as a consequence of the foregoing conclusion and\u00a0 under the same hypothesis, the plaintiffs,\u00a0 as the descendants of Sy\u00a0 Quia by his first marriage, have no right to claim Sy Quia's share in the conjugal property acquired during his second marriage with Petronila Encarnacion for the reason that\u00a0 by\u00a0 the express provision of the law the half of the said conjugal property which would have otherwise belonged to the husband was transmitted to Petronila Encarnacion, together with the other half of the said property to which she was rightfully entitled under the law as the deceived wife.<br\/><br\/>Fourth. That,\u00a0 under\u00a0 the\u00a0 same hypothesis\u00a0 that the marriage of Sy Quia with\u00a0 Petronila Encarnacion\u00a0 is void, his former marriage not having been dissolved when he married the said Petronila Encarnacion, the children by the second marriage are,\u00a0 nevertheless,\u00a0 legitimate, this being one of the civil effects of a marriage contracted in\u00a0 good faith, as in this case, at least on the part of one of the contracting parties, Petronila Encarnacion.<br\/><br\/>Fifth. That\u00a0 Vicente Romero\u00a0 Sy Quia,\u00a0 having become a regularly domiciled denizen under the laws above cited by reason of his long residence in this country for more than fifty years and by reason of the further fact that he married a native woman, established\u00a0 himself\u00a0 in\u00a0 this city with a home of his own, acquired real\u00a0 property and engaged in business generally, most of the property left by him at the time of his death being real property, the questions raised by plaintiffs' petition must be determined in accordance with the laws of the Philippines to\u00a0 which\u00a0 Sy Quia\u00a0 submitted himself when he came to the Islands and secured a residence therein, and not\u00a0 in accordance with any other foreign or unknown law.<br\/><br\/>Sixth. That,\u00a0 aside from the fact that it does not specifically appear from the record what are the Chinese laws applicable to the\u00a0 issues\u00a0 of this case, there is no proof of the existence of the Chinese laws referred to by the\u00a0 \"plaintiffs, nor is\u00a0 there anything to show that the books or\u00a0 pamphlets introduced by them in\u00a0 evidence\u00a0 contain\u00a0 any specific laws of the\u00a0 Celestial Empire.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 foregoing disposes explicitly or implicitly, affirmatively or otherwise, of all the questions raised by the various assignments of error submitted by both parties; and in our opinion it is not necessary to dispose of each of them in detail\u00a0 in view\u00a0 of the conclusion at which\u00a0 the\u00a0 court\u00a0 has arrived in this most important litigation.<br\/><br\/>For\u00a0 the reasons hereinbefore stated, we are of the opinion,\u00a0 and so\u00a0 hold, that the judgment\u00a0 of the\u00a0 trial court, appealed from by\u00a0 both parties, should\u00a0 be\u00a0 reversed,\u00a0 and that we should, and do hereby, absolve the defendants of the complaint upon which this action was instituted, without any special order\u00a0 as to\u00a0 the\u00a0 costs of both\u00a0 instances.

He was understood to be single.\u00a0 He alleged that fact\u00a0 in a public document and added to that allegation the solemnity of his oath.\u00a0\u00a0 He was taught the tenets of the Catholic faith and entered the fold of its church a\u00a0 ceremony which required the better part of two years.\u00a0 The espousals were made, the banns published, and the marriage publicly solemnized.\u00a0\u00a0 For more than\u00a0 half a century no one appeared to question its legality or attack its validity.\u00a0\u00a0 Death had stilled the lips of the husband for more than eleven years, and the wife,\u00a0 enfeebled in mind and body, was on the very verge of the grave, so near in fact that she died before this action was tried, when the attack was made upon it.\u00a0\u00a0 Even then the assault was not made by the alleged wife in\u00a0 China, nor by her children.\u00a0 They\u00a0 lived for\u00a0 nearly forty years wholly apart from the alleged husband and father, and died, mother and children, without having asserted, during all that time, their\u00a0 rights before the world.\u00a0 It remained for the second generation, the grandchildren of the Chinese\u00a0 wife, those whom Sy\u00a0 Hien brought from\u00a0 China to this country,\u00a0 to resuscitate and revive an alleged relationship which had lain dormant for more than fifty years.<br\/><br\/>Again, I\u00a0 ask, what kind\u00a0 of evidence must public policy, indeed, public necessity require before it will permit that the marriage be held established?<br\/><blockquote>\"Every intendment of the law leans to matrimony. When a marriage\u00a0 has been shown in evidence, whether regular or irregular, and\u00a0 whatever the form of the proofs, the law raises a strong presumption of its legality - not only casting the burden\u00a0 of proof on the party objecting, but requiring him throughout, in every particular, to make plain, against the constant pressure of this presumption, the truth of law and fact that it is illegal and void.\u00a0 So that this issue can not be tried like the ordinary ones, which are independent of this special presumption.\u00a0 And the strength of the presumption increases with the\u00a0 lapse of time through which the parties are\u00a0 cohabiting as husband and wife.\u00a0 It being for the highest\u00a0 good of the parties,\u00a0 of the children, and of the community, that all intercourse\u00a0 between the sexes in form matrimonial should be such in fact, the law, when administered by enlightened judges, seizes\u00a0 upon all probabilities, and presses into its service all things else which can help\u00a0 it, in each particular case, to sustain the marriage, and repel the conclusion\u00a0 of\u00a0 unlawful commerce.\u00a0 This doctrine explains why,\u00a0 as between the two\u00a0 presumptions of innocence and life, the law prefers the one which makes the marriage good.\u00a0 It extends through the entire law of marriage, and casts\u00a0 its weight beneficially into\u00a0 the balance\u00a0 when other considerations are\u00a0 conflicting, or their effect\u00a0 is doubtful. Persons dwelling together in apparent matrimony are\u00a0 presumed, in the absence of any counterpresumption or evidence special to the case, to be in fact married.\u00a0 The reason is that such is the common order of society, and that if the parties\u00a0 were not what they thus hold themselves out\u00a0 as being, they would\u00a0 be\u00a0 living in the\u00a0 constant violation\u00a0 of decency and of law.\u00a0 And because marriage is the highest public interest, this presumption' is stronger and less easily overthrown than the other and ordinary presumptions of fact.\u00a0\u00a0 If a ceremony of marriage appears in evidence, it is presumed to have been rightly performed, and to have been preceded by\u00a0 all the needful preliminaries.\u00a0 <i>If one of the 'parties had before been married,\u00a0 there is notv a presumption of great strength that the partner in such former marriage is dead.\u00a0\u00a0 Yet if such partner is shoivn to have been living shortly before this second\u00a0 marriage transpired, the presumption of life will be in conflict with that of the validity of the marriage, whereupon all the\u00a0 circumstances should be made to appear, and the fact\u00a0 be deduced from the entire evidence\u00a0 as operated upon by these rules.\u00a0 <\/i> An absence of the standard period of seven years will not now be required to make the second marriage good, because the seven-years presumption of life is weakened\u00a0 or overcome by that of the validity of the second marriage.\"\u00a0 (Bishop, Marriage, Divorce and Separation, vol. 1, sees. 956, 958, 959.)<br\/><br\/>\"The law always\u00a0 presumes against the\u00a0 commission\u00a0 of crime, and therefore, where a woman, twelve months after her first husband was last heard of, married a second husband, and\u00a0 had children by\u00a0 him, the\u00a0 sessions did right in presuming,<i> prima facie<\/i>, that the first husband was\u00a0 dead at the time of the second marriage; and that it was incumbent on the party objecting to the second marriage\u00a0 to give some\u00a0 proof that the first\u00a0 husband was then alive.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (The King\u00a0 <i>vs.<\/i> The Inhabitants of Twining, 2 B. &amp; Aid., 386.)<br\/><br\/>\"As against the duly proved marriage\u00a0 of Patrick\u00a0 Larkin and Cephalia\u00a0 P.

That\u00a0 when the said Sy Quia was about 12 years of age he came to the Philippine Islands and remained here until he was about 25 years of age.<br\/><br\/>Third. That in the year 1847 he returned to China\u00a0 where he was married to\u00a0 one Yap\u00a0 Buanju\u00a0 (Yap\u00a0 Pua\u00a0 Niu), a Chinese woman, in accordance with the\u00a0 laws and customs of the Chinese Empire.<br\/><br\/>Fourth. That\u00a0 Sy Quia and Yap Buanju\u00a0 lived\u00a0 together from 1847 to 1851 or 1852; that during this\u00a0 period\u00a0 two children were born of that marriage\u00a0 and were called\u00a0 respectively, Sy Bibo and Sy Biguel.<br\/><br\/>Fifth. That about 1870 the said\u00a0 Sy Bibo was\u00a0 lawfully married to Ho Gim Niu, a Chinese woman, and there were born to them two children,\u00a0 one of which died\u00a0 in\u00a0 infancy, and\u00a0 the other,\u00a0 named Sy Jui Niu, one\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiffs in the present case, died after\u00a0 the\u00a0 commencement of the present action, leaving an only child named Sian Han, a minor, now represented in the present case by his guardian, C.\u00a0 W. O'Brien; that when\u00a0 the first\u00a0 child\u00a0 of the said\u00a0 Sy Bibo died\u00a0 in\u00a0 infancy\u00a0 he\u00a0 adopted\u00a0 in\u00a0 accordance\u00a0 with the laws and customs of China, a Chinese child named Sy Joe Chay,\u00a0 one\u00a0 of\u00a0 the plaintiffs\u00a0 in\u00a0 the present case.\u00a0 Sy Bibo died in China in\u00a0 1882.<br\/><br\/>Sixth. That said Sy Biguel,\u00a0 on or\u00a0 about the year 1871, was lawfully married in China to a Chinese woman named Yap Su Niu,\u00a0 from which marriage there\u00a0 were born two children, named,\u00a0 respectively, Sy Joe Lieng and Sy\u00a0 Chuaniu, who are each plaintiffs in\u00a0 the present action.\u00a0 Sy Biguel died in China in\u00a0 or about the year 1880, leaving his two above-named children as his only heirs.<br\/><br\/>It will be seen, therefore, that each of the plaintiffs included in the\u00a0 title of this cause is a direct descendant of the said Sy Quia and his\u00a0 Chinese wife, Yap\u00a0 Buanju.<br\/><br\/>Seventh. Yap Buanju, the Chinese wife of the said\u00a0 Sy Quia, died\u00a0 in China, intestate, in the year 1891.<br\/><br\/>Eighth.\u00a0 In the year 1851 or 1852 Sy Quia returned to the Philippine\u00a0 Islands where he\u00a0 became a member of the Catholic\u00a0 Church and adopted the name of Vicente Romero Sy Quia.<br\/><br\/>Ninth. In 1853 the\u00a0 said\u00a0 Sy Quia\u00a0 (Vicente Romero Sy Quia) was married, in accordance with the forms prescribed by the Roman Catholic Church, to the defendant, Petronila Encarnacion, who died in the year 1906, after the commencement of the present action, and her estate is now represented by Pedro Sy Quia, her son,\u00a0 as\u00a0 administrator.<br\/><br\/>Tenth. The said Sy Quia (Vicente Romero Sy Quia) died intestate in the city of Manila, in the year 1894.<br\/><br\/>Eleventh. After the\u00a0 marriage of the said Sy Quia (Vicente Romero Sy Quia) and Petronila Encarnacion, there were born\u00a0 to\u00a0 them five children, whose names,\u00a0 with the years of their birth, are as\u00a0 follows:<br\/><br\/>Apolinaria\u00a0 Sy\u00a0 Quia, 1853\u00a0\u00a0 (who died,\u00a0 without\u00a0 being married, intestate, in May 1900, leaving her mother as her only heir.)<br\/><br\/>Maria Sy\u00a0 Quia, who died before the commencement of the present suit, leaving as her only heir surviving Generoso Mendoza Sy Quia, one of the defendants in the present action.<br\/><br\/>Gregorio Sy Quia, 1856, Pedro Sy Quia, 1858, and Juan Sy Quia, 1860.<br\/><br\/>It will be seen that the present defendants, Petronila Encarnacion\u00a0 (Pedro Sy Quia now being the administrator of her estate), Generoso Mendoza Sy Quia, Gregorio Sy Quia, and Pedro Sy Quia, on his own behalf and as administrator of the estate of Petronila Encarnacion, and\u00a0 Juan Sy Quia, are the direct descendants of the said Sy Quia (Vicente Romero Sy Quia) and Petronila Encarnacion.<br\/><br\/>Twelfth. After the death of Sy Quia (Vicente Romero Sy Quia) on the 9th day of January, 1894,\u00a0 his\u00a0 estate was duly administered by his Filipino wife, Petronila Encarnacion,\u00a0 and a final distribution of his estate was made by order of the court of\u00a0 First\u00a0 Instance of Manila,\u00a0 on the 3d day of August, 1900, among the defendants herein.<br\/><br\/>Thirteenth. That the said Sy Quia (Vicente Romero Sy Quia)\u00a0 during his married\u00a0 life had accumulated\u00a0 a large fortune,\u00a0 consisting of real\u00a0 and personal property,\u00a0 all of which was located in the Philippine Islands.<br\/><br\/>Fourteenth. That while there is some dispute upon the question\u00a0 as to the amount of\u00a0 property which the said Petronila Encarnacion brought\u00a0 to the marriage,\u00a0 we\u00a0 are of the opinion that\u00a0 the proof justifies\u00a0 the conclusion that at the time\u00a0 of the marriage of the said Sy Quia and Petronila Encarnacion, they each brought\u00a0 to the marriage relation property\u00a0 of about the same value.<br\/><br\/>Fifteenth.\u00a0 That each of the marriages of\u00a0 the said Sy Quia, the first\u00a0 in China in 1847\u00a0 to the said Yap Buanju, and\u00a0 the\u00a0 second in the\u00a0 Philippine Islands in\u00a0 1853\u00a0 to the said Petronila Encarnacion, was made in accordance with the laws\u00a0 and customs of the respective countries in which the marriage ceremonies were performed.<br\/><br\/>Sixteenth.\u00a0 There\u00a0 is nothing in the record which shows or tends\u00a0 to show that each of said marriages, so\u00a0 far as the two women were concerned, was not made in absolute good faith, believing that they had a\u00a0 right to enter into the said marriage relation, and that there was no impediment in law\u00a0 against it.\u00a0\u00a0 There is\u00a0 nothing in the record which shows or tends to show that\u00a0 Petronila Encarnacion did not enter into the marriage relation in good faith, believing\u00a0 that there was nothing in law,\u00a0 at least, which forbade\u00a0 it.<br\/><br\/>Seventeenth. We have, therefore,\u00a0 in\u00a0 brief, the following facts:<br\/><br\/>(<i>a<\/i>) That Sy Quia (Vicente Romero Sy Quia)\u00a0 and his Chinese wife, Yap Buanju, were married according to the laws\u00a0 and customs of China in 1847, and that the present plaintiffs are the direct descendants\u00a0 of that marriage.<br\/><br\/>(<i>b<\/i>) That Sy Quia (Vicente Romero Sy\u00a0 Quia)\u00a0 and\u00a0 Petronila\u00a0 Encarnacion were married in\u00a0 1853,\u00a0 in\u00a0 accordance with\u00a0 the laws and customs of the Philippine Islands, and that the defendants\u00a0 in the present case are\u00a0 the direct descendants of that marriage.<br\/><br\/>(<i>c<\/i>) That the marriage of\u00a0 the\u00a0 said\u00a0 Sy Quia with Yap Buanju had not been dissolved or annulled at the time of the marriage of Sy Quia with Petronila Encarnacion.<br\/><br\/>(<i>d<\/i>) That so far as Petronila Encarnacion was concerned her marriage was entered into in absolute good faith.<br\/><br\/>Basing his conclusions upon the foregoing facts, the Hon. A. S.\u00a0 Crossfield rendered a decision as follows:<br\/><br\/><i>(a) Giving to the children of Vicente Romero Sy Quia by his first wife, Yap Pua Niu, one-half of the said estate; and<br\/><br\/>(b) Giving to the\u00a0 children of his second wife, Petronila Encarnacion, the\u00a0 other half of the said estate.<\/i> From\u00a0 this decision the plaintiffs and defendants each appealed and each presented a bill of exceptions.<br\/><br\/><i>The plaintiffs and appellants agree to\u00a0 the findings of fact made\u00a0 by the lower court and present\u00a0 only a question of law in their\u00a0 appeal.\u00a0 The contention\u00a0 of the plaintiffs\u00a0 is that they are entitled to all of the estate of Vicente Romero Sy Quia,\u00a0 under the law.<\/i><br\/><br\/>The defendants and appellants each excepted to the judgment of the lower court and each presented a motion for a new trial, based upon the ground that the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause did not justify the findings of fact made by the lower court, which motion the court denied; to which order of the lower court the defendants duly excepted.<br\/><br\/>The contention of the defendants and\u00a0 appellants is:<br\/><br\/>First.\u00a0 That the findings of fact made by the lower court are not supported by the evidence; and<br\/><br\/>Second. That under the evidence they are entitled to all of the estate of Vicente Romero Sy Quia.<br\/><br\/>The lower court, in speaking of the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause, said: <i>\"There is practically no conflict in the evidence received, except such as possibly may be drawn from inference, and\u00a0 I find the following facts undoubtedly established:\" <\/i> [The findings are set out above.]<br\/><br\/>The appeals\u00a0 brought to this court present both a question of fact and of law.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiffs\u00a0 and appellants, under\u00a0 their appeal,\u00a0 are not entitled to have the evidence examined.\u00a0 (See par. 2, sec,\u00a0 1, Act No. 1596, Philippine\u00a0 Commission.)\u00a0 They made no motion for a new trial in the court below.<br\/><br\/>The defendants, by virtue of their having made a motion for a new trial based upon the ground\u00a0 that the\u00a0 evidence was insufficient to justify the decision, and having excepted to the order of the court thereon, are entitled to have the evidence examined in this court.\u00a0 This court, however, while it may review the evidence taken in the court below, can not affirm or reverse except:<br\/><br\/>(<i>a<\/i>) By giving due weight to the fact that the judge who tried the case saw the witnesses\u00a0 when they testified; and<br\/><br\/>(<i>b<\/i>) When there is a preponderance of evidence against the findings of the lower court.\u00a0 (See sec. 1, Act No. 1596, Philippine Commission.)<br\/><br\/><i>Our contention, taking into consideration the fact that the lower court saw and heard the witnesses, is that his findings of fact are supported by a clear preponderance of the\u00a0 evidence and that his judgment, based upon such facts, is clearly supported by the lato as well as by sound reason and justice.<\/i><br\/><br\/>The majority opinion finds that Sy Quia and Yap Pua Niu were not married in China, as is alleged by the plaintiffs for the reasons:<br\/><br\/>First. That his\u00a0 children and grandchildren,\u00a0 after the lapse of about fifty-eight years,\u00a0 could not present\u00a0 the letters which passed between the father of Sy Quia and the father of his\u00a0 wife\u00a0 Yap Pua Niu, before\u00a0 the marriage, by which these parents arranged for the said marriage, without\u00a0 the consent of the contracting\u00a0 parties, which\u00a0 letters they (the contracting parties)\u00a0 never had in their possession and\u00a0 never saw; and<br\/><br\/>Second. Because\u00a0 when Sy Quia in the Philippine Islands was\u00a0 trying to practice a fraud upon his Chinese wife and his to be second Filipino wife, he then said that he was not married.<br\/><br\/>All of the Chinese children of Sy Quia, born of his Chinese wife, were born in China between the years of 1847 and 1852, and those who were living at the time of the trial were between\u00a0 fifty-three\u00a0 and fifty-eight\u00a0 years of age.\u00a0 As\u00a0 a practical\u00a0 question,\u00a0 how many\u00a0 men\u00a0 of the most civilized nations,\u00a0 who\u00a0 have\u00a0 reached the\u00a0 age of fifty years, could then\u00a0 prove\u00a0 by documentary evidence, in the absence of public record, the\u00a0 marriage of their parents? I\u00a0 doubt whether there is a single member of this present court who would\u00a0 be\u00a0 able to\u00a0 prove by documentary evidence the marriage of\u00a0 his parents.\u00a0 The assertion is ventured that not a single member of the Supreme Court of the United States, the recognized greatest judicial body, would be able to prove by documentary proof, outside of public\u00a0 records, that his parents were legally married.<br\/><br\/>There is no\u00a0 proof in the record that the Chinese Government had a system of\u00a0 public\u00a0 records\u00a0 of\u00a0 marriage at the time of the marriage of Sy Quia with his first wife Yap Pua Niu, or that they have any such system now.<br\/><br\/><i>Sy Quia could not, by any representation of his made at the time or before\u00a0 his\u00a0 second marriage in the\u00a0 Philippine Islands, change the fact of his first marriage in China for the purpose\u00a0 of\u00a0 defeating the legitimacy\u00a0 of\u00a0 his\u00a0 children born of his Chinese wife. <\/i><br\/><br\/>The evidence\u00a0 adduced by the plaintiffs relating to the marriage of Sy Quia in China is literally as follows:<br\/><br\/>Sy Peng testified as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Q.

Civilians\u00a0 recognized the\u00a0 hardship\u00a0 resulting\u00a0 to\u00a0 children born of the second marriage and\u00a0 provided a remedy earlier than\u00a0 those who were subject to\u00a0 the common law.\u00a0 While law 1, title 13 of the fourth <i>Partida <\/i>does not expressly make the second marriage valid, when one or both of the parties entered into the\u00a0 same in good faith, believing\u00a0 that there existed no impediment, yet this is the effect of the law,\u00a0 for the reason that it expressly makes the\u00a0 issue of such marriage legitimate, which, of course, could not be done except upon\u00a0 the theory\u00a0 that\u00a0 the marriage\u00a0 itself was legitimate and legal.\u00a0 This provision of the <i>Partidas<\/i> does not, however, allow the legality\u00a0 of such manage to exist nor the legitimacy of the children, except\u00a0 up to the time\u00a0 when the innocent spouse has knowledge that the marriage is\u00a0 illegal.\u00a0 From that time the\u00a0 marriage is\u00a0 regarded as an illegal marriage and children which are born after that time are illegitimate. Law 1,\u00a0 title 13, <i>Partida<\/i> 4, is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"By a legitimate child is meant he who is begotten according to law; and\u00a0 they are\u00a0 called\u00a0 legitimate\u00a0 who are\u00a0 born of a father and mother who are really married according to the ordinances of Holy Church.\u00a0 And\u00a0 although\u00a0 it should happen, that between those who were married\u00a0 openly and publicly in the Church, there should exist any impediment for which the marriage\u00a0 ought to\u00a0 be\u00a0 dissolved,\u00a0 yet\u00a0 the children they\u00a0 beget\u00a0 (<i>fiziessen)<\/i>\u00a0 before they\u00a0 know of\u00a0 such impediment, will\u00a0 be legitimate.\u00a0 And so\u00a0 it would be,\u00a0 as well where both\u00a0 of the spouses were ignorant of the existence of the impediment, as when one\u00a0 only of them knew it; for the ignorance of one of the spouses alone, would render the children legitimate.\u00a0\u00a0 But if after they knew with certainty\u00a0 of the existence of such impediment,\u00a0 they should beget children, those that they afterwards have, will not be legitimate.\u00a0 Yet if during the existence of such impediment, and while both or one of them was ignorant of it, they should be accused before\u00a0 the judges of the Holy Church and before the impediment was\u00a0 proved or the sentence\u00a0 pronounced, they should have\u00a0 children,\u00a0 those that they beget (<i>fiziessen<\/i>) during the\u00a0 existence of the doubt, will all be legitimate.\u00a0 And so the children a man has by his\u00a0 concubine\u00a0 (<i>barragana<\/i>) will be legitimate, if he afterwards marry her.\u00a0 For although\u00a0 they\u00a0 are\u00a0 not legitimate when they are born, yet so great is\u00a0 the force of matrimony, that they become legitimate immediately their father and mother are married.\u00a0 And so ft woujd\u00a0 be, if a man have a\u00a0 child by his slave, and\u00a0 he afterwards marry her.\u00a0\u00a0 For marriage has so great an\u00a0 effect;\u00a0 that as soon as it is contracted, the mother becomes free,\u00a0 and the children legitimate.\"<\/blockquote><i>The above-quoted provision of the Partidas is a very just and humane provision of law.\u00a0 It justly protects those who have innocently entered into the solemn relation of marriage, and their descendants.<\/i>\u00a0 The good faith of the parties will be presumed until the contrary is shown\u00a0 or proved.\u00a0\u00a0 (Art. 69, Civil Code (Spanish); <i>Las Leyes\u00a0 de Matr'inonio<\/i>, sec. 96; Gaines<i> vs. <\/i>Hennen, 65 U.

In other words, the\u00a0 Civil Code is nothing more or less, with a few modifications, than a codification of the separate decrees and\u00a0 royal acts applicable to the Philippine\u00a0 Islands.\u00a0 The Civil Code was not put\u00a0 in force in the Philippine Islands until on or about the month of December, 1889.\u00a0 Sy Quia was married to his first wife in 1847 and to\u00a0 his second\u00a0 wife\u00a0 in 1852 or 1853.\u00a0 If his second marriage was null and void, it was null and void in 1852\u00a0 or 1853, and the laws governing the effect of\u00a0 such nullity in force at that time must govern, which\u00a0 were \"The Laws of the Indies\" above quoted.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Law 1, title 13, <i>Partida<\/i> 4.)\u00a0\u00a0 But even admitting that article\u00a0 1417\u00a0 is the law applicable in cases where the marriage is null, we contend that it was\u00a0 not the\u00a0 intention of the\u00a0 legislature\u00a0 to\u00a0 apply said provision\u00a0 to a\u00a0 case like the present.\u00a0\u00a0 We\u00a0 do not believe that it was the intention of the\u00a0 wise\u00a0 legislators of the Spanish Government, where a man\u00a0 having a legal wife and children marries another woman\u00a0 and has children by\u00a0 such other woman, that the effect of the\u00a0 second marriage was to turn over to the second wife and children all of the\u00a0 property belonging to him, to the prejudice of the first wife and legitimate children.\u00a0 Such an interpretation is\u00a0 nauseating to every sense of justice and right.\u00a0\u00a0 We do not believe that it was the intention of the Spanish Government to enforce said article (1417)\u00a0 to the prejudice of\u00a0 a prior legal\u00a0 wife and legitimate children.\u00a0 To give article 1417 the interpretation which the majority opinion contends for is to deprive the first wife and the first children,\u00a0 who have committed no wrong\u00a0 whatever,\u00a0 of their legitimate\u00a0 participation\u00a0 in the property of their husband and father.<br\/><br\/>We believe that\u00a0 article 1417 is not applicable to a case where a man or\u00a0 a woman, having a legitimate wife\u00a0 or husband and children, marries a second\u00a0 wife or husband. We do not believe that it was the intention of the legislature to punish the first wife and children in the way indicated by said article.\u00a0 We do not believe that it is the intention of said article to take\u00a0 away from the legitimate wife and children property\u00a0 to which they are legally entitled\u00a0 and give it to a second wife and\u00a0 children, in\u00a0 the manner contended for\u00a0 in the majority opinion.\u00a0 There can be no objection to the interpretation given to article 1417 when the marriage is declared null and void, by reason of the provisions of the Civil Code,\u00a0 (Arts. 101, 102, and 103.)\u00a0\u00a0 But even the cases mentioned in these articles do not contemplate the existence of a\u00a0 former wife and legitimate children.<br\/><br\/>The Civil Code contains no\u00a0 provisions for the division of property in a case like the present.\u00a0 We, therefore, insist that the law which is applicable to the present case is that provision of the Partidas which we have quoted above (law 1, title 13,\u00a0 Partida 4)\u00a0 and which is the\u00a0 provision\u00a0 of\u00a0 law followed by the\u00a0 Supreme Court\u00a0 of the United States and the other States above\u00a0 quoted.\u00a0\u00a0 We believe that this provision\u00a0 affords an adequate, equitable, and\u00a0 just remedy, and one in consonance with\u00a0 sound reason and justice\u00a0 for a case like the present.\u00a0 Courts are frequently called upon to solve questions where there is no express provision of statutory law to assist\u00a0 them.\u00a0 We are\u00a0 fortunate,\u00a0 however,\u00a0 in\u00a0 the present complicated case, to find that the wise legislators of the Spanish\u00a0 Government, assisted always by the pure motives and high ideals\u00a0 of the Holy Roman Catholic Church, have made an express provision governing the present case. (Law 1, title 13, <i>Partida<\/i> 4.)<br\/><br\/>Suppose, for example, that Sy Quia had married his first wife in 1847 in one part of the Philippine Archipelago and as a result of said\u00a0 marriage there were born to\u00a0 them two children,\u00a0 and that\u00a0 after the birth of the two children Sy Quia had gone to some remote part of the Archipelago and had there married his second wife and had lived with her for a number of years and\u00a0 had had children and acquired property as\u00a0 he did in the present case.\u00a0 Would the courts, under\u00a0 these facts,\u00a0 have given all of the\u00a0 property\u00a0 to the second wife and children?\u00a0 So far as the present case is concerned, in our opinion, the mere fact that the first wife happened to live in China, instead of in the Philippine Islands, makes no difference in the solution of the problem. It is of no importance\u00a0 whatever whether he married his first\u00a0 wife in\u00a0 one part of\u00a0 the Archipelago or in a foreign country.\u00a0 (GaineS <i>vs.<\/i> Hennen, 65 U. S., 553; Hubbell <i>vs.<\/i> Inkstein, 7 La. An., 252; Germann<i> vs.<\/i> Tenneas, 39 La An., 1021.)<br\/><br\/>With\u00a0 reference to the second question, \"What\u00a0 are the rights of the respective wives in the estate of the said Sy Quia, he having died intestate?\" and having held that for the purposes\u00a0 of participation in the estate of the husband, they\u00a0 are each regarded\u00a0 as legitimate, it would seem to be a just and humane conclusion to hold that each wife in the present\u00a0 case\u00a0 should succeed to that interest\u00a0 in\u00a0 the estate of the husband to which\u00a0 she would be entitled were she the only legitimate wife.<br\/><br\/>There is no evidence that the Chinese wife brought\u00a0 any property whatever\u00a0 to the marriage relation.\u00a0 The\u00a0 proof showed\u00a0 that\u00a0 the\u00a0 Filipino\u00a0 wife,\u00a0 Petronila\u00a0 Encarnacion, brought\u00a0 to the marriage relation about the same amount of property which\u00a0 the husband had at the time of their marriage.<br\/><br\/>Article 1392 of the Civil Code provides that \"by virtue of the conjugal\u00a0 partnership, the earnings or\u00a0 profits indiscriminately obtained by either of\u00a0 the spouses during the marriage, shall belong to the husband and wife,\u00a0 share and share alike, upon\u00a0 the dissolution of the marriage,\"<br\/><br\/>Article 1424 of the Civil Code provides that the\u00a0 amount of indebtedness\u00a0 against\u00a0 the respective spouses, chargeable to the conjugal partnership, shall first be deducted, and that then the\u00a0 remainder shall be divided.<br\/><br\/>Article 1426 of the Civil\u00a0 pode\u00a0 provides that \"the\u00a0 net remainder of the partnership property <i>shall be divided, share and share alike, between the husband and wife, or their\u00a0 respective heirs.\"<\/i><br\/><br\/>From these provisions of the Civil Code, which were in force at\u00a0 the\u00a0 time of the\u00a0 settlement of the\u00a0 estate of\u00a0 the said Sy Quia, it would follow, having held that each of the wives was legitimate, for the purposes of sharing in\u00a0 the conjugal partnership property, that each would be entitled to one-half of the net estate of the said Sy Quia.\u00a0 No decisions of the supreme court of Spain have been found bearing upon this question.\u00a0\u00a0 Several decisions, however, have been found in the\u00a0 decisions of the\u00a0 Supreme\u00a0 Court of\u00a0 the United States and of the supreme court of\u00a0 the\u00a0 State of Louisiana, as well as other States of the United States.\u00a0 The decisions\u00a0 of the\u00a0 Supreme Court of\u00a0 the\u00a0 United\u00a0 States and those of the State of Louisiana are especially\u00a0 applicable to the\u00a0 present case, for the reason that they deal with\u00a0 the Spanish codes.<br\/><br\/>The first case that we find is that of\u00a0 Clendenning <i> vs.<\/i> Clendenning et al. (March, 1825), 7 Martin's Reports (La.), 587.\u00a0 In that case a man had married two women and had had children by each of them.\u00a0 The question\u00a0 presented to the court was, What were the respective rights of the wives and thier respective children?\u00a0\u00a0 The court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The defendants contend, that notwithstanding that\u00a0 the plaintiffs' father had had a\u00a0 lawful wife,\u00a0 at the time of\u00a0 the second marriage, as the woman he last married was in good faith, at the time of the marriage,\u00a0 and\u00a0 ever since,\u00a0 at least till after the birth of the last child she had\u00a0 by him, <i>her marriage has its\u00a0 civil effects, and she and her\u00a0 children,\u00a0 the present defendants, are\u00a0 entitled to al<\/i>l the advantages the law gives to a lawful wife and children.\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 There seems to be no dispute on the question of law.\u00a0 The woman, who was deceived by a\u00a0 man, who\u00a0 represented himself as single, and his children\u00a0 begot\u00a0 while the deception lasted, <i> are bona fide wife\u00a0 and\u00a0 children, and as such are entitled to all the rights of a legitimate wife and issue.<\/i>\"<\/blockquote>The\u00a0 next case which we find is that of Patton et al. <i> vs.<\/i><br\/><br\/>The Cities of Philadelphia and New Orleans (May, 1846), (1 La. An., 98).\u00a0\u00a0 The facts, as related\u00a0 by the judge who wrote the\u00a0 opinion in the\u00a0 case, are as follows:<br\/><br\/>In the year 1790 Abraham Morehouse married Abigail Young in the State of New\u00a0 York and had two children\u00a0 by her.\u00a0 He subsequently came to the Spanish colony of Louisiana, gave it to be understood that he was a widower, and in September, 1799, by an act passed by the commandant of Fort Miro, in the District of Ouachita, acting as a notary public,\u00a0 agreed\u00a0 to take as his wife Eleonore Hook.\u00a0\u00a0 The commandant states in the act that it is passed before him in conformity\u00a0 with a custom sanctioned by the Government on account of the want of spiritual assistance, and that the marriage is to be solemnized before the church on the first opportunity.<br\/><br\/>At the time of the marriage Abraham Morehouse declared that he was\u00a0 the widower of Abigail Young.<br\/><br\/>During the trial at the cause it\u00a0 was insisted that the second marriage ceremony performed in Louisiana in September,\u00a0 1799, was simply a contract <i>per verba de futuro.<\/i> The court held that the ceremony was followed by cohabitation and that a marriage <i>per verba de futuro cum copula <\/i>had all the\u00a0 legal\u00a0 effects of a\u00a0 marriage per verba de prsesenti. The court\u00a0 held further that\u00a0 it was\u00a0 the intention of the parties\u00a0 to make a marriage <i>per verba de prsesenti. <\/i><br\/><br\/>After the marriage with the second wife in 1799, Abraham Morehouse acquired\u00a0 large landed estates in\u00a0 the State of Louisiana. He died in 1813, his two wives being then alive.\u00a0 Many years\u00a0 after the death\u00a0 of\u00a0 Abraham Morehouse, one Stephen Girard acquired some\u00a0 of this\u00a0 land through the\u00a0 first wife, Abigail Young, and her sons, they representing\u00a0 themselves to be\u00a0 the only legitimate wife and children of the said Abraham Morehouse.\u00a0 Later the said Stephen Girard, who\u00a0 had acquired about 208,000 acres of land from the said Morehouse, by will, bequeathed to the city\u00a0 of\u00a0 New\u00a0 Orleans\u00a0 the\u00a0 undivided\u00a0 one-third of the said 208,000\u00a0 acres of\u00a0 land and the remaining two-thirds to the city of Philadelphia.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiffs in the case\u00a0 of Patton\u00a0 et al.\u00a0 claimed to be the only lawful heirs\u00a0 and\u00a0 representatives of the said Abraham Morehouse\u00a0 and brought\u00a0 an action against the defendants (the Cities of Philadelphia and New\u00a0 Orleans) to get possession of the said\u00a0 property obtained through the said Stephen Girard.\u00a0 The essential facts being as we have just stated, the supreme court of Louisiana discussed the following questions:<br\/><br\/>First.<i> Was the marriage of Abraham Morehouse to Eleonore Hook\u00a0 valid as a civil contract, under\u00a0 the laws in force in Louisiana at the time\u00a0 of\u00a0 its celebration, although that marriage\u00a0 was not\u00a0 afterwards solemnized\u00a0 before the Church?<\/i><br\/><br\/>Second. If the marriage was\u00a0 not\u00a0 valid, when\u00a0 did Eleonore Hook acquire such\u00a0 a knowledge of tyie previous marriage of her husband as\u00a0 to put an end to her good faith?<br\/><br\/>Third. While she\u00a0 continued\u00a0 in\u00a0 good faith,\u00a0 what right had each of the wives to the acquests and gains made by the husband?<br\/><br\/>It will be remembered that the commandant who solemnized the marriage ceremony between Morehouse and his second wife, stated to the parties that the marriage was to be solemnized before the church on the first opportunity. It was\u00a0 contended on the part of\u00a0 the defendants that the marriage never having been solemnized before the church, that there in fact never existed a marriage between Morehouse and his\u00a0 second\u00a0 wife.\u00a0 In other words, that it was a\u00a0 clandestine\u00a0 marriage\u00a0 (<i>clandestina matrwioni<\/i>a).\u00a0 The defendants\u00a0 further argued that under and\u00a0 by virtue\u00a0 of the provisions\u00a0 of the\u00a0 Council\u00a0 of\u00a0 Trent, which had been adopted in Spain by\u00a0 a\u00a0 <i>real cedula<\/i> of Philip II, on the 12th day of August, 1564, the marriage could not be considered a valid marriage.\u00a0 The court held, however,<i> that no proof had\u00a0 been presented\u00a0 showing that the provisions\u00a0 of\u00a0 the Council of\u00a0 Trent had ever been\u00a0 made applicable to\u00a0 the Territory of Louisiana. <\/i> The court admitted,\u00a0 for the purpose of argument, that the Kings of Spain intended that the adoption of the General Council of Trent should extend to all the countries\u00a0 which they might subsequently discover or acquire.\u00a0 <i>It has never\u00a0 been understood that when the King of Spain\u00a0 had\u00a0 adopted any ecclesiastical orders or laws that such laivs had the effect of annulling the civil laws in force at the time.<\/i><br\/><br\/>From the earliest periods of which we have any authentic\u00a0 history, there was a constant effort\u00a0 on the part of the Christian\u00a0 Church to bring about\u00a0 reforms in the method of entering into the marriage relation\u00a0 and to make it\u00a0 a most holy\u00a0 relation.\u00a0 Marriages by\u00a0 purchase, sale, and capture, concubinage, and\u00a0 polygamy\u00a0 were always\u00a0 abhorrent to the high\u00a0 ideals of the Christian\u00a0 Church.\u00a0 A study of the history of the growth of the marriage relation shows clearly that the Church believed that the marriage should be a holy\u00a0 sacrament,\u00a0 that\u00a0 the state in\u00a0 its civil functions was not capable of dealing with such a holy relation, and therefore the Christian Church, from\u00a0 the earliest period of its history, made a strenuous effort to have the entering into the\u00a0 marriage relation controlled absolutely by Church ordinances.\u00a0 As\u00a0 early as the year 325\u00a0 at Nice\u00a0 a general council\u00a0 of\u00a0 318 bishops was convened for the purpose of considering reform in the matter of marriages.\u00a0 Again in the year 787 another council was called\u00a0 at Nice, composed of 350 bishops for the same purpose.\u00a0 Again at the Council of Winchester in the year 1076 it was resolved: \"That no man give his\u00a0 daughter or kinswoman in marriage\u00a0 without the priest's benediction,\" and declared that \"otherwise the marriage shall not be\u00a0 deemed legitimate, but as fornication.\" Twenty-six years\u00a0 later (1102)\u00a0 at the Council of London,\u00a0 an attempt\u00a0 was made to put\u00a0 a check upon all clandestine contracts of marriage.\u00a0\u00a0 This council resolved that \"promises of marriage\u00a0 made between a\u00a0 man\u00a0 and woman without witnesses are declared to be null, if either party deny them.\"<br\/><br\/>In the year 1175 the resolutions of the preceding councils were reinforced\u00a0 by the\u00a0 canons of\u00a0 Archbishop Richard, taken from the\u00a0 decrees of Pope Ormidas of the\u00a0 year\u00a0 514, ordering that \"no faithful man, of what\u00a0 degree soever, marry in private, but in public, by receiving the\u00a0 priest's benediction.\u00a0 If any priest\u00a0 be discovered to have married any in private, let him be suspended\u00a0 from his office\u00a0 for three\u00a0 years.\"<br\/><br\/>Later, in\u00a0 the\u00a0 year 1200, Archbishop\u00a0 Walter ordained that \"no marriage be contracted without the banns thrice published in the\u00a0 church, nor\u00a0 between persons\u00a0 unknown, and no marriage not\u00a0 publicly solemnized in the face of\u00a0 the Church is to be\u00a0 allowed except\u00a0 by special\u00a0 authority\u00a0 of the bishop.\"<br\/><br\/>It was contended for many years that\u00a0 no marriage was valid unless it had been entered into by\u00a0 prescribed religious celebration.\u00a0 The\u00a0 efforts\u00a0 of the Church to control marriages to the end that it should be recognized as\u00a0 a holy sacrament and not a\u00a0 civil contract, were evidenced\u00a0 in each of the\u00a0 councils of Lateran (Letran).\u00a0 The last of the councils of Lateran (Letran) was held in the\u00a0 year 1215.\u00a0 This council resolved that\u00a0 all unblessed\u00a0 marriages were\u00a0 illegal. Notwithstanding the\u00a0 efforts of the Christian Church\u00a0 to make all marriages illegal which had not been celebrated under\u00a0 the rites of the Church, it was finally compelled to recognize, as valid, marriages which were celebrated without the intervention\u00a0 of priest.<br\/><br\/>The next\u00a0 general\u00a0 effort\u00a0 on\u00a0 the\u00a0 part\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 Christian Church to control the question of\u00a0 marriage and to make the relation more holy and\u00a0 sacred, was by the Council\u00a0 of Trent.\u00a0 The\u00a0 Council\u00a0 of Trent was\u00a0 the\u00a0 nineteenth ecumenical council of the Holy Catholic Church,\u00a0 held at\u00a0 Trent, an imperial free\u00a0 city, under a\u00a0 prince bishop, in the Province of Tyrol.\u00a0 The council was called by\u00a0 Pope Paul\u00a0 III on\u00a0 November 1,\u00a0 1542, and was finally opened December 13, 1545.\u00a0 This council held twenty-five sessions at various times,\u00a0 some of them at Bologna.\u00a0 It was prorogued\u00a0 several times.\u00a0\u00a0 It was prorogued on the 28th of April, 1552.\u00a0 Pope Pius IV convoked the council\u00a0 again on the 18th of January, 1563.\u00a0\u00a0 This council passed many resolutions\u00a0 for\u00a0 reform, among which the recommendations as to\u00a0 marriage were not the least.\u00a0\u00a0 (See Alcubilla, <i>Diccionario de la Administracion\u00a0 Espanola<\/i>, p. 4.)<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 Council\u00a0 of Trent resolved\u00a0 \"that henceforward\u00a0 all marriages not contracted\u00a0 in the presence of a priest and two or three witnesses\u00a0 shall be void.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (See 3 Alcubilla, 63.)<br\/><br\/>It was the purpose of the Council of Trent to have its resolutions adopted and\u00a0 enforced in all Catholic communities.\u00a0 Philip II accepted as a law of the\u00a0 State\u00a0 by royal cedula dated in Madrid the 12th of July,\u00a0 1564, the decrees of the Council of Trent.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (See <i>Novisima\u00a0 Recopilacion<\/i>, law 13, title I, book I.)<br\/><br\/>W. Prescott states\u00a0 in his famous history of the reign of Philip II that it was his\u00a0 policy to enforce strict conformity to the Roman Catholic communion.\u00a0\u00a0 That no marriage was valid unless, celebrated according\u00a0 to the rites\u00a0 of, and\u00a0 in observance of\u00a0 the principles laid down by the canon law. These ecclesiastical\u00a0 laws\u00a0 continued to rule in Spain\u00a0 for over three centuries, but upon the dethronement of Isabela II\u00a0 (1868)\u00a0 the question\u00a0 arose whether the civil marriage ought not to be introduced.\u00a0\u00a0 On\u00a0 the 18th day\u00a0 of\u00a0 June, 1870, a new law was passed\u00a0 (<i>La Ley Provisional de Matrimonio Civi<\/i>l) enacting that a civil ceremony alone made a lawful contract and that the\u00a0 marriage\u00a0 ceremony should be performed by civil officials.\u00a0\u00a0 But in 1875 when the conservative party was reinstated, and\u00a0 the minor king, Alfonso XII had ascended the throne, the\u00a0 regency, by a mere <i>decreto (real decreto\u00a0 de 9\u00a0 de\u00a0 Febrero, 1875)<\/i> revived the religious marriage of the Council of Trent.\u00a0 It will be borne in mind, however, that this real decreto of the Queen Regent allowed the laws relating to civil marriage to remain in force.\u00a0 The\u00a0 said\u00a0 real decreto\u00a0 (9th of February, 1875)\u00a0 made\u00a0 certain exceptions.\u00a0 They, <i>\"de otra creencia que la verdadera y malos catolicos\"<\/i> who remained, in consequence of their nonobservance of\u00a0 religion regarding marriage\u00a0 <i>\"imposibilitados\u00a0 de\u00a0 santificarlo\u00a0\u00a0 el\u00a0 Sacramento.\"<\/i> Later, on the 27th of February, 1875, another decree was issued by the Queen\u00a0 Regent,\u00a0 providing\u00a0 that no\u00a0 Roman Catholic could celebrate in Spain a valid marriage before acivil official. (See 25 American Law Review, p.52<br\/><blockquote>\"Philip the Second, by royal cedula dated Madrid, July 12, 1564, accepting as law of the State the decrees of the Council of Trent, extinguished completely the last vestiges of our laws of the forum, and he brought to the highest state of perfection the unification of civil and Catholic marriages, at the time when, in the rest of Europe, a new era was opened to\u00a0 the\u00a0 marital legislation\u00a0 of\u00a0 the middle ages through\u00a0 the reform that broke the bonds which up to then had united\u00a0 Church and\u00a0 State.\u00a0 Wherever\u00a0 religious\u00a0 communions were established other\u00a0 than Catholic, it <i>was no longer possible for the State not to recognize as legitimate many marriages which the Catholic Church had not blessed.<\/i>\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The resolutions of the Council\u00a0 of Trent were adopted as a part of the laws\u00a0 of the Kingdom of\u00a0 Spain.\u00a0 Article 75 of the Civil\u00a0 Code (Spanish) provides that \"the requisites, forms, and solemnities for the celebration of canonical marriages shall\u00a0 be governed by the provisions of the Catholic Church, and of the Holy Council of Trent,\u00a0 accepted as laws of the kingdom.\"\u00a0\u00a0 It will be noted, however, that the provisions of the Catholic Church and of the Holy Council of Trent\u00a0 were only accepted with reference to canonical marriages.\u00a0 The Civil Code\u00a0 (Spanish) chapter 3, title 4, from articles 83 to 100, relating to civil marriages, provides for the capacity of the contracting parties\u00a0 and the celebration of the marriage.\u00a0 The Civil Code (Spanish) also\u00a0 provides for civil marriages in which there was no provision\u00a0 for the intervention of priest or of the Church.<br\/><br\/>The Civil\u00a0 Code was promulgated in\u00a0 Spain on\u00a0 the 30th of June, 1876.\u00a0 It will be remembered, however,\u00a0 that six years\u00a0 prior to the adoption of the Civil Code, to wit, on the 18th\u00a0 of June, 1870, there were promulgated \"<i>Las Leyes Provisionales del Matrimonio\" <\/i> In said law (June 18,1870) there seems to\u00a0 have been no provision whatever for the celebration of canonical marriages, recognized by said law; neither were the forms prescribed by the\u00a0 Catholic Church and by the holy Council of Trent for the celebration of marriages expressly prohibited.<br\/><br\/>The exact date when the preparation of the <i>Siete\u00a0 Partidas<\/i> was commenced and completed is not expressly stated by any of the authors.\u00a0\u00a0 It is certain, however, that <i>El Rey Don Alfonso\u00a0 El Sabio,<\/i>\u00a0 ordered\u00a0 their preparation in the early part of the thirteenth century (1251) and that they were probably completed in the early part of the\u00a0 fourteenth century\u00a0 (perhaps 1330).\u00a0 The\u00a0 provisions of law\u00a0 1,\u00a0 title 13, Partida 4, above quoted, relating to the effect of a second marriage entered into in good faith by one or both of the spouses,\u00a0 continued in force up to the time of the promulgation of <i>\"Las Leyes Provisionales del Matrimonio\"<\/i> in 1870, and were in force in Las Indias during all that period.\u00a0 The law of 1870 makes no express reference to the provisions of the Partidas.\u00a0 Said law, however, in the third\u00a0 section of chapter 3, contains the following provisions:<br\/><blockquote>\"Art.\u00a0 94.\u00a0 A null marriage, contracted\u00a0 in good faith by both spouses, shall produce all its civil effects while it

forward and now constitute in effect article 69 of the Spanish Civil Code, which was made effective in the Civil\u00a0 Code applicable to the\u00a0 Philippine Islands on the\u00a0 8th of December, 1889.\u00a0 The above provisions\u00a0 of the Civil Code,\u00a0 however, remained in force in the Philippine Islands but a\u00a0 few days, for the reason that General Weyler on\u00a0 the 29th of

the\u00a0 reason that some of the other books of the Civil Code also contain titles 4 and 12.\u00a0\u00a0 It is now,\u00a0 however, well established that\u00a0 the titles referred to by\u00a0 General Weyler are titles\u00a0 4 and 12 of\u00a0 book I.\u00a0\u00a0 (See Benedicto <i>vs.<\/i> De la Rama, 3 Phil. Rep., 34.)<br\/><br\/>The law of 1870 was never promulgated\u00a0 in the Philippine Islands, except articles 44-78, inclusive.\u00a0\u00a0 (See\u00a0 royal decree of April 13, 1883.)<br\/><br\/>It might be argued that\u00a0 the promulgation of\u00a0 the provisions of article 69 of the Civil Code in the Philippine Islands had the effect of annulling the provisions of the Partidas theretofore in force. But even admitting that to be\u00a0 true, by reference to the proclamation or decree\u00a0 of General Weyler, it will be found that he provided for the reestablishment of the laws relating to marriage, legitimacy, etc., which had hitherto been in force.\u00a0\u00a0 It would seem to be clear, therefore, without referring to the provisions of the Civil Code, that at the time of the marriage of Sy Quia, law 1, title 13 of Partida 4\u00a0 was the law in force in the Philippine Islands, and that each of his wives,\u00a0 under the circumstances in the present case, should\u00a0 be\u00a0 considered legitimate, and the children born of each marriage should be regarded as legitimate children, and that said wives should each be entitled to the benefits of the provisions of article 1392 of the\u00a0 Civil Code.<br\/><br\/>The ecclesiastical decrees had no effect in Spain until they had been\u00a0 adopted by the King.\u00a0\u00a0 They were only binding upon the ecclesiastical bodies within the territory and\u00a0 upon the\u00a0 civil authorities when the Government of Spain expressly made them so; in\u00a0 other words, the mere adoption of an ecclesiastical order\u00a0 or law\u00a0 governing the holy\u00a0 Catholic Church in Spanish territory was only binding as a civil law, when the same\u00a0 was expressly adopted by the King. Therefore, the mere fact that the marriage ceremony had not been solemnized in accordance with the provisions of the holy council of Trent,did not make such marriage null.<br\/><br\/>In the case of Patton <i>vs.<\/i> The Cities of Philadelphia and New Orleans, the court held that the ceremony performed by the said <i>commandante <\/i>had all the legal effect of a marriage per verba de prsesenti and that t he parties to the contract\u00a0 were\u00a0 recognized as husband and\u00a0 wife, and that<i> it had all the\u00a0 civil effects of a marriage\u00a0 contract <\/i> The <i>commandante, <\/i> in the\u00a0 celebration of the marriage ceremony, declared that he had performed the marriage in conformity with a <i>custom sanctioned<\/i> by the Government.\u00a0 The Supreme Court\u00a0 of the United\u00a0 States,\u00a0 in the case of Arredondo vs. United States\u00a0 (6 Peters, 691, 714),\u00a0 said that when the <i>commandante <\/i>says\u00a0 he had authority and exercised it, his authority will be presumed and that no one can\u00a0 question it but\u00a0 his superiors.<br\/><br\/>It was admitted that Eleonore Hook married\u00a0 Morehouse in good faith,\u00a0 believing that there was no existing impediment\u00a0 to such marriage\u00a0 and\u00a0 that\u00a0 all\u00a0 of the\u00a0 children were begotten\u00a0 or born before\u00a0 she\u00a0 had any knowledge of the fact that there existed\u00a0 a legal impediment\u00a0 to\u00a0 such marriage.\u00a0\u00a0 The court held, in discussing\u00a0 the question of the rights\u00a0 of each of the wives,\u00a0 <i>\"that the laws of Spam recognized in such cases, two entire communities.\" <\/i>\u00a0 As the wife, under those laws forfeits her share of the\u00a0 acquests and gains,\u00a0 when she is guilty of\u00a0 adultery, <i>so the\u00a0 husband forfeits his\u00a0 share when he has two wives living, and each of the wives takes the undivided one-half to which the law would\u00a0 entitle her if she was alone.\"<\/i><br\/><br\/>Paz, in his sixty-first consulta, class\u00a0 9, states the law as follows, in a case identically\u00a0 the same\u00a0 as the present:<br\/><blockquote>\"Out of the acquests and gains, the\u00a0 debts must\u00a0 be paid, because what the parties owe during the marriage\u00a0 can not form a part of the acquests and gains, and belongs to the creditors.\u00a0 The\u00a0 balance, after paying the debts, must\u00a0 be divided between the two wives, without any\u00a0 portion of it going\u00a0 to the succession\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 husband.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 reason\u00a0 of this is that by the laws of\u00a0 this realm, one-half of the acquests or gains belongs to the first wife, although they have been made by the husband\u00a0 (book 5,\u00a0 N<i>ew Recopilacion, <\/i>title 9, I, 1-6), and although the second law of this title requires the cohabitation\u00a0 of the wife with the husband in order that she be entitled\u00a0 to her share, yet as the marital cohabitation has not failed\u00a0 through her fault, but on the contrary through the fault of\u00a0 her husband, who abandoned her, s<i>he is not to\u00a0 lose her rights on account\u00a0 of the faults or misconduct of her husband.\u00a0 Imputari non debit ei per quern non stat si\u00a0 non faciat quod\u00a0 per cum fuerat faciendum.\"\u00a0 <\/i>(De Reg.\u00a0 Jur. 6, reg. 41.)<\/blockquote>To the\u00a0 second\u00a0 wife, the\u00a0 other\u00a0 one-half is\u00a0 due because by virtue\u00a0 of her good faith at the time of her marriage, <i>she\u00a0 is reputed the lawful wife, for the same reason for which the, law recognizes her issue as legitimate.<br\/><\/i><br\/>This\u00a0 doctrine\u00a0 is confirmed by Covarrubias <i> en Epi<\/i>t.\u00a0 (p. 2, chap. 7, sec. 1,\u00a0 No. 7); Antonio Gomez\u00a0 (1, 50 de Toro, No.\u00a0 77) ; and Molina (De Just.\u00a0 Tract. 2, Disp.\u00a0 432), who all agree that it is the common opinion of the\u00a0 doctors of the\u00a0 law that a woman marrying\u00a0 in good\u00a0 faith, although the marriage may be null,\u00a0 is entitled to one-half the acquests and gains, <i>from which it results that one-half goes to each of the wives<\/i>, and that the husband, deceiving the second\u00a0 and doing\u00a0 a grievous wrong to the first, refuses unjustly to either, the share which belongs\u00a0 to her,\u00a0 and that he is bound to satisfy both out of everything he possesses,\u00a0 because the\u00a0 law favors\u00a0 those\u00a0 who\u00a0 are deceived against those deceiving them. <i> Cum deceptis\u00a0 et non decipientibus jura subveniunt<\/i><br\/><blockquote>\"In\u00a0 taking from the father's succession those acquests and\u00a0 gains, no wrong is done the inheritance or legitimate portion of his children, because\u00a0 this is a just debt, which he owes to his two wives, and the thing which the father owes is not inherited by his\u00a0 children,\u00a0 but taken by his creditors as\u00a0 their\u00a0 own.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Paz,\u00a0 <i>Consultas\u00a0 Varias,<\/i>\u00a0 pp. 483-484.)<\/blockquote>The next case\u00a0 involving the same question is\u00a0 that\u00a0 of Hubbell <i>vs<\/i>. Inkstein (April, 1852), 7 La.

Smith, in 1831 or 1832, married,\u00a0 according to the\u00a0 laws of the State of\u00a0 Texas,\u00a0 one Maria Jesusa Delgado.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 said\u00a0 Maria\u00a0 Delgado\u00a0 (the second wife)\u00a0 was totally ignorant of the first marriage. The husband died in 1845.\u00a0 During the marriage with the second wife a\u00a0 large estate\u00a0 was acquired.\u00a0 At the\u00a0 time\u00a0 of the marriage with the second\u00a0 wife neither had any property.\u00a0\u00a0 Harriet\u00a0 Stone,\u00a0 the first wife,\u00a0 in\u00a0 or about the year 1833, obtained a divorce from her husband, the said William Smith.\u00a0\u00a0 Later, the children of the\u00a0 first wife brought an action for the partition and distribution\u00a0 of the property\u00a0 of their father\u00a0 between\u00a0 them and the\u00a0 wife and children\u00a0 of the second\u00a0 marriage.\u00a0 The court granted the partition, and, in deciding the question, said (p. 145):<br\/><blockquote>\"The second\u00a0 marriage of Smith with\u00a0 Maria Jesusa Delgado\u00a0 was not null and void in law,\u00a0 with reference either to the wife or\u00a0 the children of\u00a0 that marriage.\u00a0 In Spanish law, such a marriage\u00a0 is designated\u00a0 as\u00a0 putative,\u00a0 and the consort who enters into such matrimony ignorant that her partner\u00a0 has a\u00a0 wife\u00a0 or husband living, <i>is in law not only innocent of a crime, but has all the\u00a0 rights, incidents, and privileges pertaining to a\u00a0 lawful marriage,<\/i> and these are continued as long as there is ignorance of the former or\u00a0 of an impediment to\u00a0 the\u00a0 second marriage.\"<\/blockquote>In the case of Abston et al. <i>vs.<\/i> Abston et\u00a0 al.\u00a0 (March, 1860), (15 La.

After\u00a0 the making of the said will and\u00a0 before\u00a0 his\u00a0 death, John Abston, with his\u00a0 third wife and\u00a0 child removed to the State of Louisiana and there died.\u00a0 Later his said\u00a0 will was duly admitted\u00a0 to probate and executed in the State of Louisiana.\u00a0 (No dates are given\u00a0 as\u00a0 to these various incidents.)<br\/><br\/>Later the said Olive Abston and her son, John N.

Hennen (December, 1860),\u00a0 (65 U.

Kelley.\u00a0 Soon after\u00a0 the\u00a0 marriage of Harrington\u00a0 with Barfield, they left the State of Louisiana and went to the State of Arkansas, where a son was born to them.\u00a0 Cecelia, at the time of her marriage, had a brother and sister living; her parents were also living at that time.\u00a0 Later her parents died and her brother and sister, Ira and Isabelle, divided the estate of their parents, believing that Cecelia was no longer living.\u00a0 Later, in 1875,\u00a0 the son born of the marriage of Harrington and Cecelia appeared in the locality where <i><i>Ira and Isabelle lived and\u00a0 demanded his mother's\u00a0 share of his grandfather's\u00a0 estate.\u00a0\u00a0 His mother had then\u00a0 been dead several\u00a0 years, having died\u00a0 in the State of Arkansas. Ira and Isabelle\u00a0 claimed that he\u00a0 was a bastard and had no interest in the estate\u00a0 of their father.\u00a0\u00a0 The court held that the marriage of Harrington and Cecelia, so far as Cecelia was concerned, was a lawful manage and that the son born of said marriage was a legitimate son and was entitled to his mother's interest\u00a0 in his grandfather's estate. <\/i><\/i><br\/><br\/>(See also the succession of J.

The question is,\u00a0 Should said article 10\u00a0 apply equally to\u00a0 them?\u00a0 The first is\u00a0 a <i>permanent resident,<\/i> with a<i> permanent domicile;<\/i> the second a <i>temporary resident<\/i>, with a temporary domicile. Should\u00a0 the wife and children of A in\u00a0 the administration and distribution of his estate be\u00a0 compelled to invoke the provisions of\u00a0 the\u00a0 law of the State of the\u00a0 United States from which he came, in view of the fact that they have never had the slightest intention to return to the United States from the time they landed here?\u00a0\u00a0 We\u00a0 do not\u00a0 believe that it was\u00a0 the purpose of the code makers,\u00a0 at the time they drafted\u00a0 said article 10, to compel the descendants of permanent\u00a0 residents\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 Philippine Islands, even though not permitted to exercise the political rights under the Government, to invoke the laws of a foreign country, one to which they owed no allegiance whatever, in the administration and distribution of their inheritance.\u00a0 We believe that article 10 should be given such an interpretation as would permit\u00a0 foreigners\u00a0 who have permanently allied themselves with the interests of the country\u00a0 to have their property administered after their death in accordance <i>with the laws of the country which they have selected as their home. <\/i>\u00a0 We are living in a progressive age,\u00a0 and it is\u00a0 not believed that the present age should be governed by\u00a0 any ironclad interpretation of a statute of the centuries gone by which is contrary to the sense\u00a0 of the people of today.\u00a0\u00a0 Statutes should be interpreted, so far as it is possible, to meet the conditions. While the courts are not permitted to amend the law, yet, nevertheless, they are\u00a0 permitted\u00a0 to give a law\u00a0 such an interpretation as will make it\u00a0 applicable to new conditions. Many examples might\u00a0 be given to show where this has been done.\u00a0\u00a0 It is believed that the conditions in the Philippine Islands will justify the assertion that there are literally hundreds of families here who are not entitled to exercise the political rights of the Government, who are\u00a0 strangers in fact under the law, but who have adopted the Philippine Islands as the place of their <i>permanent abode<\/i>.\u00a0\u00a0 They have forsworn either in fact or by implication their\u00a0 allegiance to any\u00a0 other country or government.\u00a0 Should\u00a0 their descendants,\u00a0 in the face of\u00a0 these conditions, be compelled\u00a0 to resort to\u00a0 the laws of a\u00a0 foreign\u00a0 country,\u00a0 of\u00a0 which they know nothing and for which\u00a0 they care less, for\u00a0 rules and regulations in the administration\u00a0 and\u00a0 distribution of their inheritance?\u00a0\u00a0 It may possibly be that they left their native land for the\u00a0 very purpose of evading the very laws\u00a0 in question.\u00a0\u00a0 We believe that it\u00a0 is perfectly justifiable under the provisions of article 10, and in view of the provisions of the real decreto of the 17th day of November, 1852,\u00a0 as well as\u00a0 that of the 4th of July, 1870,\u00a0 to give said\u00a0 article such an interpretation as\u00a0 will permit foreigners\u00a0 who have adopted the Philippine Islands\u00a0 as their permanent\u00a0 home and domicile\u00a0 to\u00a0 have their property, after their\u00a0 death, administered and distributed to their descendants\u00a0 in accordance with the laws\u00a0 of this country\u00a0 the\u00a0 land\u00a0 which they have\u00a0 adopted as\u00a0 their permanent home and\u00a0 not\u00a0 in accordance with\u00a0 the laws of\u00a0 the\u00a0 country\u00a0 which they had permanently abandoned.\u00a0 No doubt many\u00a0 of\u00a0 the families to which reference is made above have for years not only been\u00a0 exercising the civil\u00a0 rights accorded\u00a0 them under the Spanish Government but have also exercised political rights. We believe that under such circumstances the law of presumption should\u00a0 be applied\u00a0 after\u00a0 they have exercised civil and political rights for a number of years, and\u00a0 that they should be presumed to be citizens\u00a0 of the country\u00a0 which they have\u00a0 adopted as\u00a0 their permanent home.\u00a0 To sustain this conclusion we invoke the doctrine established by the Supreme Court\u00a0 of the United States\u00a0 in the case of Boyd <i>vs.<\/i> Thayer (143\u00a0 U.

We are of the opinion and so hold that the question of his citizenship is of no importance.\u00a0\u00a0 All of the property of his estate was in the Philippine Islands at\u00a0 the time of his death, both\u00a0 real and\u00a0 personal, and therefore should.be\u00a0 governed in its descent\u00a0 in accordance with\u00a0 the laws in force here. In the absence of a\u00a0 special\u00a0 contract\u00a0 between the spouses to the\u00a0 contrary, their respective\u00a0 rights\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 conjugal property will\u00a0 be governed by the <i>lex\u00a0 domicilii,<\/i> and not by the law of the\u00a0 place\u00a0 of\u00a0 the marriage.\u00a0\u00a0 It\u00a0 may well\u00a0 be doubted whether the spouses could control the descent of their\u00a0 property\u00a0 even\u00a0 by contract when their children\u00a0 or descendants or ascendants were the only parties interested. The record does not disclose that Sy Quia, with either wife, had made a contract at the time of entering into\u00a0 the marriage relation\u00a0 which in any way\u00a0 affected the\u00a0 descent\u00a0 or distribution of his estate. <br\/><br\/>The defendants herein\u00a0 are\u00a0 in possession pf\u00a0 their respective distributive shares of the estate of Sy Quia.\u00a0 They were given possession of it by order of the Court of First Instance of Manila, and\u00a0 it\u00a0 is to be\u00a0 presumed that\u00a0 they went into possession of the same in good faith.\u00a0 They are, therefore, not subject to\u00a0 pay interest\u00a0 or rent for the use of the same until after a judicial demand had been made by the persons who\u00a0 claimed a lawful possession.\u00a0 From that\u00a0 date,\u00a0 however,\u00a0 the defendants are liable to pay interest\u00a0 or rent upon\u00a0 that\u00a0 portion\u00a0 of the property which they possess which rightfully belongs to the plaintiffs.<br\/><br\/>From the judgment of the lower\u00a0 court both the plaintiffs and\u00a0 defendants appealed.\u00a0\u00a0 Each presented a bill\u00a0 of\u00a0 exceptions,\u00a0 together\u00a0 with numerous assignments\u00a0 of error. Each of the appellants presented most interesting and readable\u00a0 briefs.\u00a0 The\u00a0 assignments of\u00a0 error of\u00a0 the respective parties have not been\u00a0 considered\u00a0 in detail.\u00a0 We\u00a0 believe, however, that the fundamental questions which were presented by the different\u00a0 bills of exceptions and the various assignments of error have been answered in the\u00a0 foregoing opinion.<br\/><br\/>Our conclusions are,\u00a0 therefore:<br\/><br\/>First.\u00a0 That each of the wives of the said Sy\u00a0 Quia was in law a legitimate wife of the said Sy Quia and the children born of the respective wives were\u00a0 legitimate children.<br\/><br\/>Second. That as a legitimate\u00a0 wife,\u00a0 each is entitled\u00a0 to one-half\u00a0 of the conjugal property of\u00a0 the estate of the said Sy Quia.<br\/><br\/>Third. That the\u00a0 children of each wife\u00a0 are entitled\u00a0 to a proportional amount\u00a0 of\u00a0 their respective\u00a0 mother's share in said estate.<br\/><br\/>Therefore the judgment of\u00a0 the lower court should\u00a0 be hereby modified and it should be ordered and adjudged:<br\/><br\/>(<i>a<\/i>)\u00a0 That a judgment be entered giving the descendants of each of the respective\u00a0 wives\u00a0 one-half of the estate\u00a0 of the said\u00a0 Sy Quia.<br\/><br\/>(<i>b<\/i>)\u00a0 That the said defendants each render an\u00a0 account of all the property received by them respectively under the said\u00a0 judicial order of the\u00a0 Court of First Instance of the city of Manila in\u00a0 1900.<br\/><br\/><i>(c<\/i>)\u00a0 That the receiver heretofore appointed By the lower court take possession of the whole estate and administer the same until the lower court can make an order\u00a0 distributing the said estate in accordance herewith.<br\/><br\/>(<i>d<\/i>)\u00a0 That the plaintiffs\u00a0 recover of the defendants legal interest\u00a0 on one-half\u00a0 of all the\u00a0 moneys received\u00a0 by the defendants from the said estate and\u00a0 a reasonable rent for the use and occupation of one-half\u00a0 of all the property\u00a0 of the said estate, said interest and rent to begin to run from the 4th of December, 1905.<br\/><\/y><\/div>",

Co., in liquidation, filed suit in the Court of First Instance of Manila against Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., Ltd., alleging in the first three paragraphs of their complaint, as a cause of action, that the plaintiff is a regular collective mercantile association organized in accordance with the laws of these Islands, duly registered in the mercantile registry, and at present in liquidation; that the defendant is a joint stock mercantile firm organized in accordance with the laws of England, registered in the mercantile registry of Manila, and has done and is still doing business in these Islands under the name of Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., Ltd., which acquired the business that was conducted in these Islands by Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., the assets, liabilities, and all the obligations of which were assumed by the defendant.<br\/><br\/>In the other paragraphs of the complaint, from the fourth to the twelfth, the plaintiff set forth that, prior to December 1, 1898, Warner, Barnes &amp; Co. were conducting a business in Albay, the principal object of which was the purchase of hemp in the pueblos of Legaspi and Tabaco for the purpose of bringing it to Manila, here to sell it for exportation, and that on the said date of December 1, 1898, the plaintiff company became interested in the said business of Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., in Albay and formed therewith a joint-account partnership whereby Aldecoa &amp; Co., were to share equally in the gains and losses of the business in Albay; that the defendant is the successor to all the rights and obligations of Warner, Barnes &amp; Co,, among which is that of being manager of the said joint-account partnership with Aldecoa &amp; Co.; that the defendant acted, and continues to act as such manager, and is obliged to render accounts supported by proofs, and to liquidate the business, which defendant not only has not done, in spite of the demand made upon it, but it has expressly denied the right of plaintiff to examine the vouchers, contenting itself with forwarding copies of the entries in its books, which entries contain errors and omissions that hereinafter will be mentioned.<br\/><br\/>Said entries moreover, show the partnership to have commenced on June 30, 1899, whereas its operations should have commenced and did commence on December 1, 1898, on which date the joint-account partnership commenced; that, with respect to the liquidation of the business, the operations having been closed on December 31, 1903, Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., Ltd., the defendant, has not realized upon the assets of the firm by selling the property which constitutes its capital; that the persons who were the managers and general partners of Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., are also members of Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., Ltd., and are the managers and directors of that firm in the Philippine Islands and are the same ones who, under the previous firm name of Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., admitted Aldecoa &amp; Co. as a participant in one-half of the said business, on the 1st day of December, 1898; that the said directors of the defendant company, unlawfully, maliciously, and criminally conspired with the persons who were managing the commercial firm of Aldecoa &amp; Co. during the years 1899, 1900, 1901, 1902, and 1903, to defraud the latter of its interest in the said joint-account partnership, buying the silence of the said managers with respect to the operations of the joint-account partnership during the time comprised between the 1st of December, 1898, and the 30th of June, 1899, and also with respect to the errors and omissions in the accounts relating to the second semester of 1899, and those relating to 1900, 1901, 1902, and 1903.<br\/><br\/>That the said fraudulent acts were not known to the partners of the plaintiff firm until the managers, in collusion with the managers of the defendant firm to defraud and injure the plaintiff firm, had ceased to hold their positions, to wit, until after the 31st of December, 1906, and that by reason, of this conspiracy to defraud the plaintiffs, the defendants have been benefited; that the errors and omissions found in the entries of the books kept by the defendant firm as manager of the joint-account partnership are those expressed in detail here below:<br\/><br\/>(<i>a<\/i>)\u00a0\u00a0 It appears that between the 10th of July and the 26th of December, 1899, 43,934 piculs of hemp arrived in Manila for the joint-account partnership, which were purchased in Legaspi and Tabaco at 13 pesos per picul, and, after charging against this hemp excessive expenses for collection, storage, freight, fire, marine, and war insurance, personnel, etc., the defendants, Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., as managers of the joint-account partnership and commission agents of their joint-account partners, claim that they purchased the said hemp for themselves, but do not give the price received from the sale thereof and merely credit it at 13 pesos a picul, when the average market price at that time was 16.50 pesos a picul;

Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., Ltd., deduct from the profits which they show as belonging to Aldecoa &amp; Co., the sum of P7,400, under the appearance of an insurance premium, and they delivered that sum to the plaintiffs' managers with whom they conspired, for the purposes of the collusion alleged in Paragraph VII of the complaint, in this manner failing to observe the truth in their statement of the facts. Aldecoa &amp; Co., therefore, claim for themselves this amount, P7,400.<br\/><br\/>(<i>i<\/i>) On December 31, 1903, on a capital of P50,000 brought in by Aldecoa &amp; Co. and to whom it should bear 5 per cent interest from the 8th of June, 1900, the interest is unduly credited to the joint-account, thereby injuring the plaintiffs in the sum of P8,750.<br\/><br\/>(<i>J)<\/i> On December 31, 1902, Aldecoa &amp; Co. are charged with six months' interest, amounting to P736.46, on a balance debited against them for alleged losses, and on June 30, 1903, they are charged with P1,818.58 for a like reason. These two items should be stricken out, because the ac- counts when correctly made show no losses, but profits. By such debits the plaintiffs have been injured in the sum of P1,277.52.<br\/><br\/>(k) In the entries corresponding to the years 1902 and 1903, Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., Ltd., give the price of \"<i>corriente buena<\/i>\" (current good), to the grade which, according to the mark, was classified as \"<i>abaca superior<\/i>\" (superior hemp) ; the price of \"<i>corriente ordinario\" <\/i>(current ordinary), to the hemp marked under the classification of \"<i>corriente buena\"<\/i> (current good) ; the price of \"<i>segunda superior\" <\/i>(second superior), to what is <i>\"corriente<\/i>\" or \"current,\" and so on successively; whence results a difference of price to the value of P233,102.18, in 1902, and P74,274.90, in 1903, one-half of which differences should be credited to Aldecoa &amp; Co., that is, P153,688.54.<br\/><br\/>(<i>l<\/i>) The value of the properties brought in by Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., Ltd., to the joint-account, instead of cash capital, is omitted from the accounts. These properties are the following:<br\/><br\/>Those purchased from Mariano Roisa, consisting of one galvanized-iron-roofed warehouse, with hemp press; one house of strong materials and the lot on which it stands, in Tabaco, P12,000.<br\/><br\/>That purchased from Juana Roisa, which is one small warehouse of strong materials, in Tabaco, worth about P2,500.<br\/><br\/>Those purchased from D. Manuel Zalvidea situated in Tabaco, which are: One warehouse of strong materials, with press; another warehouse of strong materials; and two houses of strong materials, together with the lots on which they are built, P22,000.<br\/><br\/>Those purchased from D. Marcos Zubeldia, in Legaspi, which are: Four warehouses with three hemp presses, and one house of strong materials, with their corresponding lots, P50,000.<br\/><br\/>Total cost, P86,500.<br\/><br\/>The complaint further sets forth that if the entries made by the defendant in its books show in themselves the foregoing errors and omissions, the plaintiff has good grounds for believing that, if the vouchers were examined, still greater errors would be found, as to which the plaintiff can not formulate its claims with exactness until the defendant renders it an account, accompanied by vouchers; that the defendant, as manager of the joint-account partnership with Aldecoa &amp; Co., neglected to comply with what is especially prescribed in article 243 of the Code of Commerce, as a duty inherent to its position as manager of the joint-account partnership, which is that of rendering an account with vouchers, and that of liquidating the said business, for it refuses to furnish the plaintiff the documents required for their examination and verification, and also refuses to realize the firm assets by selling the warehouses, houses, and other property which constitute the capital; that, as the defendant refuses to do the things above related, the plaintiff has no other easy, expeditious and suitable remedy than to petition the court for a writ of mandamus, wherefore it prays the court to protect it in its rights and to issue the said mandamus against the defendant, ordering it, within a date set for this purpose, to render to the court an account, accompanied by invoices, receipts, and vouchers of the Albay business, beginning the said account as of December 1, 1898, the date on which the partnership was formed, and correcting in it the errors and omissions related in paragraph 9 of this complaint; that the defendant credit and pay to the plaintiff the sums alleged in that paragraph to be due to plaintiff, with interest at the legal rate upon the sums omitted and for the difference between the amounts incorrectly debited and credited, from the respective dates on which they should appear, if correctly entered; that after the said accounts have been rendered and discussed, judgment be entered for any balance which may appear in favor of the plaintiff, including the sums claimed, and legal interest thereon. The plaintiff also prays that the writ of mandamus fix a term within which the defendant is to liquidate the business, selling the properties aforementioned and distributing the proceeds between both the litigants, and that the defendant be adjudged liable for costs of suit, and plaintiff be granted such other and further relief as may be found just and equitable.<br\/><br\/>On November 11, 1907, the defendant filed a written answer and counterclaim against the defendant, and, notwithstanding the overruling of the demurrer filed by the latter to the counterclaim, the court by writ of December 4, 1907, ordered that the defendant should, within a period of five days, make its allegations more specific with respect to certain particulars mentioned in the order of the court, and both parties being notified thereof, the defendant, on January 24, 1908, prayed the court to authorize it to file the attached amended answer instead of the original one.<br\/><br\/>In the said amended answer the firm of Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., Ltd., the defendant, states that it denies each and every one of the allegations of the complaint, with the exception of those which are expressly admitted in its answer, and admits the allegations of paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 of the complaint. In answer to the allegations of paragraphs 4 to 12 of the complaint, it admits that on June 30, 1899, a jointraccount partnership was formed between the plaintiff and the defendant for the operation of a business in Albay, the principal transactions of which were the purchase of hemp in Legaspi and Tabaco, of which business one-half of the results, whether losses or gains, appertained to the plaintiff. Defendant also admits that the said business continued under the management of the defendant company, as manager of the said joint-account partnership, until December 31, 1903; but it denies all the other allegations contained in the said paragraphs. For its first special defense, the defendant alleges that during the period that the said joint-account partnership existed, the manager thereof, the defendant, rendered to the plaintiff just and true accounts of its transactions as manager of the said partnership, which accounts have been approved by the plaintiff, with the exception of those relating to the year 1903, and as to the latter, that the same were objected to by plaintiff firm solely upon the grounds mentioned in clause (k) of paragraph 9 of the complaint, which objections are wholly unfounded. As its second special defense, the defendant alleges that more than four years have expired between the time the alleged right of action accrued to the plaintiff and the date of the filing of the complaint. For all the reasons set forth in this amended answer, the defendant prayed that it be absolved from the complaint, with the costs against the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>On and subsequent to the 14th of August, 1908, the trial of this cause was held and oral evidence was introduced by the plaintiff, but no witnesses were offered by the defendant, which finally moved for a dismissal of the case, and the court, on December 26 of the same year, 1908, rendered judgment, dismissing the complaint with respect to the petition for the rendering of an account, verified by invoices, receipts and vouchers, of the said Albay business, pertaining to the period comprised from the beginning of the business to the 31st of December, 1902, inclusive, assessing the cost against the plaintiff, and opening the second period of the trial with respect to the account for the whole year 1903, in accordance with the ruling of the court made at the commencement of the hearing. The plaintiff on being notified of this judgment filed a written exception thereto and announced his intention to forward through regular channels, a bill of exceptions, and by another writing moved for a new trial on the ground that the evidence did not justify the judgment rendered, which it alleged was openly and manifestly contrary to the weight of the evidence and to law. This motion being denied, to which exception was taken by the plaintiff, the latter duly filed a proper bill of exceptions which was certified to and forwarded to this court, together with all the documentary and oral evidence produced at the trial.<br\/><br\/>This litigation concerns the rendering of accounts pertaining to the management of the business of a joint-account partnership formed between the two litigant companies. Both the plaintiff and the defendant are in accord that, through verbal agreement, the said partnership was established, whereby they should share equally the profits and losses of the business of gathering and storing hemp in Albay and selling it in Manila for exportation, and that the commercial firm of Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., Ltd., was the manager of the said joint-account partnership. The disagreement between the parties consists in the following points: First, as to the date when the partnership was formed and began business in the province mentioned; second, whether the managing firm did render accounts, duly verified by vouchers, of its management from the date of the organization of the partnership; third, whether errors and omissions, prejudicial to the plaintiff, Aldecoa &amp; Co., exist in the partnership books and in its accounts, and whether, in the management of the said business, fraudulent acts were committed, also to the plaintiff's injury; and, fourth, whether the partnership property should be included in the liquidation of the said business and in the accounts appertaining to the year 1903, when the existence of the partnership came to an end.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the date on which the said partnership began, the plaintiff, Aldecoa &amp; Co., submitted evidence unrebutted by that of the defendant, Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., Ltd., and although the latter averred that the joint-account partnership began on June 30, 1899, denying that it was commenced, or was formed, on December 1, 1898, as the plaintiff says that it was, it is certain that the defendant has not proved its averment; and if, on the opening of this case de novo it shall not have done so. within such period as the court may see fit to determine, it will be proper to find in accordance with the value of the evidence adduced by the plaintiff and to advise the defendant to render, within a fixed period, accounts, verified by vouchers, of the management of the partnership business and pertaining to the seven months from December 1, 1898, to June 29, 1899; and, in view of the evidence adduced by the plaintiff in proof of the aforesaid first point, if the defendant does not produce other evidence in rebuttal, they must, for some reason, be expressly rejected in the judgment, if they are not to be taken into account in reaching the conclusions or in considering the case upon the merits.<br\/><br\/>As regards the second point, we agree with the opinion expressed by the lower court and find that the firm of Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., Ltd., did render accounts from June 30, 1899, to December 31, 1902, inasmuch as the very evidence introduced by the plaintiff showed that the said accounts had been rendered and were approved by it, according to the context of its own letters of the dates of July 27, 1907, and February 19, 1903. Therefore, the plaintiff is in nowise entitled, and has no right of action to compel the defendant to render accounts pertaining to that period, they having already been rendered and duly approved.<br\/><br\/>It is a rule of law generally observed that he who takes charge of the management of another's property, is bound immediately thereafter to render accounts covering his transactions; and that it is always to be understood that all accounts rendered must be duly substantiated by vouchers.<br\/><br\/>If it is a fact admitted by both litigating parties that Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., Ltd., was the manager of the business of the joint-account partnership formed between it and Aldecoa &amp; Co., it is unquestionable that it was and is the defendant's duty to render accounts of the management of the business, as it partially has done. Although the defendant has not proved, as it should have done, that it complied with its duty of rendering accounts of its management, since the letters themselves exhibited by the plaintiff, and duly authenticated as being written by the latter, prove that the defendant did render accounts from June 30, 1899, to December 31, 1902, no legal reason whatever exists for not accepting the finding of the lower court which decided that it had been proved that accounts were rendered pertaining to the period mentioned and that the said accounts were approved by the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>The procedure of the plaintiff is truly inexplicable in accepting and approving accounts that were rendered to it and which only begin with June 30, 1899, inasmuch as such approval would appear to indicate that it agreed to the claim made by the defendant that the partnership commenced on the said date; but even so&gt; once that it is proved that the actual date on which the partnership was formed was December 1, 1898, and that it is not shown that the defendant has rendered accounts corresponding to the seven months subsequent to the said date of December 1, the acceptation and approval of accounts rendered since the 30th of June 1899, does not excuse nor release the manager of the partnership, the defendant, from complying with its unquestionable duty of rendering accounts covering the aforesaid seven months. The presumption must be sustained until proof to the contrary is presented.<br\/><br\/>Moreover, the approval of accounts corresponding to the years from June 30, 1899, to December 31, 1902, does not imply that the said approved accounts comprise those pertaining to the seven months mentioned, December 1, 1898, to June 29, 1899, because the defendant, the accountant, denies that the partnership commenced on the afore said date of December 1st, asserting it began on June 30, 1899; wherefore, on defendant's rendering those accounts, it is to be presumed that it did so from the date which it avers was that of the formation of the partnership and the beginning of the business, and it is therefore evident that it has not rendered accounts pertaining to the seven months mentioned.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the third point relative to whether errors and omissions prejudicial to the plaintiff, Aldecoa &amp; Co., exist in the partnership books and in its accounts, and whether, in the management of the said business, fraudulent acts were committed to plaintiff's injury, it must be borne in mind that once the accounts have been approved which were rendered by the managing firm of Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., Ltd., the plaintiff, Aldecoa &amp; Co., is not entitled afterwards to claim a revision of the same, unless it shows that there was fraud, deceit, error, or mistake in the approval of the said accounts.<br\/><br\/>Under this hypothesis, Aldecoa &amp; Co. are strictly obliged to prove the errors, omissions, and fraudulent acts attributed to the defendant, in connection with the accounts already rendered, and approved by them, in order that the same may be revised in accordance with law and the jurisprudence of the courts. (Pastor <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>. Nicasio, 6 Phil. Rep., 152.)<br\/><br\/>The approval of an account does not prevent its subsequent revision, or at least its correction, if it is proved in a satisfactory manner that there was deceit and fraud or error and omission in it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Arts. 1265, 1266, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>Law 30, title 11, 5th Partida, provides, among other things, the following:<br\/><blockquote>\"That is precisely what we say should be observed, in all other accounts that men make among themselves, in connection with the things which belong to them. Notwithstanding that they may acknowledge the settlement of the accounts between them and promise never to bring them up again, if it be known in truth that he who gave the account or had the things in his keeping, concealed anything deceitfully, or committed other fraud against those who have a share in such thing, then neither the suit, nor such previous status and promise shall avail; on the contrary, we say that they may sue him to compel him to remedy the deceit he committed against them, and to pay all the damages and losses that have accrued to them by reason thereof; provided, however, he especially shall not have repaired the deceit that he committed.\"<\/blockquote>So that it does not matter that the accounts pertaining to the years comprised between the 30th of June, 1899, and the 31st of December, 1902, may have been approved by Aldecoa &amp; Co. Whenever this firm shall succeed in proving that there was error, omission, fraud, or deceit in these accounts, they may be duly revised, according to law.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the last point in controversy, the defendant agrees that the plaintiff has not yet approved the accounts that the former rendered, pertaining to 1903, the last year of the existence of the joint-account partnership; and, for this reason, it was provided in the judgment appealed from that the trial should continue with respect to the said accounts corresponding to the year 1903, in order that the plaintiff might make such objections and statements in regard to the same as he deemed proper, and adduce the evidence conducive to prove his claim, in accordance with law.<br\/><br\/>It is one of the duties of the manager of a joint-account partnership, to liquidate the assets that form the common property, and to state the result obtained therefrom in the final rendering of the accounts which he is to present at the conclusion of the partnership.<br\/><br\/>Article 243 of the Code of Commerce says:<br\/><blockquote>\"The liquidation shall be effected by the manager, and after the transactions have been concluded he shall render a proper account of its results.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It is a recognized fact, and one admitted by both parties, that the partnership herein concerned concluded its transactions on December 31, 1903; wherefore the firm of Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., Ltd., the manager of the partnership, in declaring the latter's transactions concluded and in rendering duly verified accounts of its results, owes the duty to include therein the property and effects belonging to the partnership in common. This rule was established by the supreme court of Spain in applying a similar precept of the mercantile code, in its decision on an appeal in cassation of the 1st of July, 1870, setting up the following doctrine:<br\/><br\/>\"In case of the liquidation of a company of this kind (denominated joint-account partnership), inasmuch as the sale of the firm assets is necessarily uncertain and eventual, considering the greater or lesser selling price that may be obtained from the property and effects which comprise such assets, the price received should be allotted in the same proportion as that fixed in the contract for the division of the profits and losses, for otherwise one of the partners would be benefited to the detriment and loss of his copartners.\" This doctrine is perfectly legal and in accord with justice, as no person should enrich himself wrongfully at the expense of another; and, in the case under review, should it be duly and fully proved that the managing firm acquired realty in the name and at the expense of the joint-account partnership with the plaintiff firm, it is just that, in liquidating the property of common ownership, such realty should be divided between the partners in the same manner as were the profits and losses during the existence of the business, from the beginning of the partnership to the date of its dissolution.<br\/><br\/>By the facts herein above set forth, it has been shown that in the present state of this cause resulting from the rendering of the judgment appealed from, it has not been possible to decide in a final manner the various issues brought up and controverted by the litigants, for, though it be granted as proved that the defendant firm, the manager of the said partnership, has in fact rendered accounts pertaining to the years from June 30, 1899, to December 31, 1902, as found in the said judgment, there still remain to be decided the four points or questions of fact before specified. Wherefore, and in accordance with section 496 of the Code of Civil Procedure, a new trial should be held for the purpose of a final decision of all the questions involved in this litigation, and accordingly the judgment appealed from is set aside and this cause shall be returned to the court below, accompanied by a certified copy of this decision, for the holding of a new trial, for which purpose, first, the defendant shall be advised that it must, within a fixed period, render an account, verified by vouchers, of its management of the business of the joint-account partnership with the plaintiff, pertaining to the months from December 1, 1898, to June 29, 1899, and to the twelve months of the year 1903, unless it shall prove in a satisfactory manner that the said partnership began on June 30, 1899, contrary to the averment of the plaintiff supported by evidence that it commenced on December 1, 1898, in which case the said rendering of account shall be restricted to the twelve months of the year 1903, in the accounts of which last period must be included all the property that is found to belong to the said partnership; second, in the examination of the accounts that may be found to have been rendered, the parties may allege and prove facts conducive to their revision or approval besides availing themselves of the evidence already adduced at trial; and, third, with respect to the accounts corresponding to the period from June 30, 1899, to December 31, 1902, already approved, the trial court shall proceed in accordance with law, duly considering the errors, omissions, mistakes and fraudulent or deceitful acts that have been alleged or may specifically be alleged in rejecting the said approved accounts, as well as the evidence introduced by both parties, and it shall be careful to decide in its final judgment all the issues raised between the parties in the course of this litigation and to provide such remedies as are proper in regard to their respective claims.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Johnson, Moreland,<\/span> and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Trent, JJ., <\/span>concur.<br\/><\/div>",

Charles\u00a0 S. Lobingier, after hearing the said petition, decreed that the said Dona\u00a0 Buenaventura Galvez y\u00a0 Puig be appointed administratrix of the said estate.\u00a0 On the 26th of November letters of administration were duly issued to her.\u00a0 On the same day the court appointed the\u00a0 commission\u00a0 authorized by law for the purpose of appraising the property of said estate and to hear claims against it,\u00a0 On the 8th of January, 1907, the commission so appointed duly qualified and entered upon the exercise of its duties.<br\/><br\/>On the 12th of January,, 1907, the\u00a0 said administratrix presented an inventory of the property of said estate which had\u00a0 come into her possession and\u00a0 under her\u00a0 knowledge without fixing any value for said property.\u00a0\u00a0 (See bill\u00a0 of exceptions, pp. 7-10.)\u00a0\u00a0 The said property consisted of <i>mobiliario y alhajas.<\/i><br\/><br\/>On the 13th of February, 1907, the administratrix presented a petition in the Court of First Instance asking for authority to sell some of the property mentioned in\u00a0 her said inventory, for the purposes mentioned in said petition. On the 16th of February, 1907, the\u00a0 Hon. A. S.

That a failure\u00a0 to include the said property in\u00a0 the inventory would result in detriment to the creditors.<br\/><br\/>\"Therefore, this counsel petitions the court to order the administratrix to include the said property in the inventory and explain for what reasons\u00a0 she did not do so in\u00a0 due season, notwithstanding that the said property is and was always\u00a0 considered as having belonged to the deceased\u00a0 Jose Reyes y Mijares and now to his heirs.\"<\/blockquote>On the 3d of July, 1909, the said motion was\u00a0 denied by the Hon. A. S.\u00a0 Crossfield.<br\/><br\/>On the 23d of July, 1909, the said administratrix made the following report:<br\/><blockquote>\"After having filed\u00a0 the inventory, such as it appears in these proceedings, vouchers were found among the papers of the\u00a0 deceased attesting\u00a0 to\u00a0 the\u00a0 latter's ownership of\u00a0 a house of strong material\u00a0 situated\u00a0 in the district of Sampaloc, designated under No. 150 of\u00a0 Calle Alix, and likewise of a share\u00a0 in the launch <i>Ventura.<\/i>\u00a0\u00a0 Neither of these properties appeared in the\u00a0 name of Jose Reyes y Mijares at the time of his death, as the house was registered in the name of other persons; but among the papers discovered there were\u00a0 private documents which proved\u00a0 the ownership of the deceased.\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore this administratrix,\u00a0 through her attorneys, took the proper steps to ascertain the truth of the facts, and\u00a0 the investigations made brought about as a final\u00a0 result the registration 'of\u00a0 the\u00a0 property situated\u00a0 on Calle Alix, No. 150, in the name of the deceased Jose Reyes y Mijares, on September 3, 1908.<br\/><br\/>\"With respect to\u00a0 the launch <i>Ventura<\/i>, the documentary records pertaining thereto are not very clear, and although from letters and documents\u00a0 it can be concluded that the deceased during his lifetime had, and his estate now has, a share therein, just what this share is this administratrix is unable exactly to say, as the value of the same and the offers\u00a0 made therefor are very indefinite, the highest bid being P5,000.\"<\/blockquote>On the 24th of\u00a0 July,\u00a0 1909, the Hon. A.\u00a0 S.\u00a0 Crossfield approved the said report.<br\/><br\/>On the\u00a0 6th\u00a0 of\u00a0 August, 1909, La Compania\u00a0 Maritima presented another motion, which was amended on the\u00a0 18th day of August in the\u00a0 following language, asking that the court, in accordance with section 690 of the Code of\u00a0 Procedure in Civil Actions, appoint a new commission for the purpose of appraising the property of said estate, to\u00a0 hear claims against it, and for other relief:<br\/><blockquote>\"I.\u00a0 Jose Reyes y Mijares\u00a0 died\u00a0 on\u00a0 the\u00a0 10th day of November, 1906, leaving\u00a0 his wife, Buenaventura\u00a0 Galvez, and his children and heirs, Leonor, Maria, Jose, Dolores, and Manuel, Leonor being married to\u00a0 Ramon Lopez.\u00a0 Buenaventura Galvez, the widow of the deceased, was appointed administratrix\u00a0 of the estate and\u00a0 guardian of the other defendants,\u00a0 with the exception of the married\u00a0 daughter, Leonor.<br\/><br\/>\"II. The defendants are residents of the city of Manila.<br\/><br\/>\"III. On March 1, 1904, it was\u00a0 discovered that the deceased, Jose Reyes y Mijares, by misappropriation of property belonging to the plaintiff party, of which he was agent and employee,\u00a0 was\u00a0 owing the same the sum of ?65,500; wherefore he signed an instrument, dated March 1, 1904, acknowledging\u00a0 the said debt.<br\/><br\/>\"IV.\u00a0 By means of the aforesaid instrument, Jose Reyes y Mijares pretended, and convinced the plaintiff company, that he had delivered to the same, in partial payment of the deibt thus contracted, all his property, and the plaintiff so believed\u00a0 in\u00a0 good faith,\u00a0 which belief was erroneous as evidenced by the facts hereinbelow enumerated.<br\/><br\/>\"V.\u00a0 After deducting all\u00a0 the amounts\u00a0 and property delivered by the instrument referred to in the next preceding paragraph,\u00a0 the said\u00a0 deceased still owed the\u00a0 plaintiff the sum of P31,517.16.<br\/><br\/>\"VI.\u00a0 The said Jose Reyes y Mijares\u00a0 left at his death property valued at P50,000.<br\/><br\/>\"VII. On November 19, 1906, the said widow, falsely pretending that she wished to administer the property of the deceased, succeeded in having the latter's estate placed in probate by her appointment as administratrix of the property and guardian of the defendants, with the exception of the defendant Leonor and her husband Ramon Lopez.<br\/><br\/>\"VIII. When the\u00a0 said widow\u00a0 learned\u00a0 of\u00a0 the plaintiff's belief that the\u00a0 deceased Jose Reyes y Mijares had in\u00a0 good faith delivered to the plaintiff all his property in partial payment of\u00a0 the debt\u00a0 which he had contracted, she alleged in her petition for the opening of the probate proceedings and her appointment\u00a0 as administratrix of the property left by the deceased, <i>that the said Jose Reyes y Mijares left no other property\u00a0 than some household furniture and vehicles, the value of which did not exceed the total sum of P1,300,<\/i> an allegation which was absolutely false and\u00a0 made for the purpose of deceiving both the court and the creditors of the deceased.<br\/><br\/>\"IX. The\u00a0 court, being deceived by the false allegation concerning the value\u00a0 of the property left by\u00a0 the deceased, was\u00a0 induced to fix the bond of the administratrix in the nominal sum of P1,300.<br\/><br\/>\"X.\u00a0 The purpose of the widow was not\u00a0 in fact to administer the estate\u00a0 of the\u00a0 deceased, but,\u00a0 in a fictitious manner,\u00a0 to\u00a0 avail herself of the provisions\u00a0 of law and to hasten the lapse of the time limits prescribed, in order that the\u00a0 claims, and especially that of the plaintiff, might be exhibited and established, as in\u00a0 fact was done,\u00a0 before the fraud should be\u00a0 discovered, so that\u00a0 she\u00a0 and her children could appropriate to their\u00a0 use the valuable estate left by the\u00a0 deceased, thereby completely eluding payment of the latter's debts; and for this purpose,\u00a0 on January 12, 1907, the administratrix presented what she called an\u00a0 Inventory and Appraisement' of the property belonging to the intestate estate of the deceased, which consists of a statement of the furniture and\u00a0 some jewelry,\u00a0 but without any appraised valuation of\u00a0 the same nor\u00a0 of\u00a0 any part\u00a0 thereof. Later, on\u00a0 February IS, 1907, she presented to the same court a motion in which she stated that a considerable part of the jewelry was pawned for money, and she\u00a0 gave\u00a0 it to be understood, in a general\u00a0 way, that\u00a0 the estate, if not insolvent, was of very scant value, and she thus continued to present motions, under the same\u00a0 supposition, until the expiration of the term fixed by the court for the presentation of claims against the estate, and in consequence thereof the plaintiff company failed to file its claim, as\u00a0 it believed that it would be entirely useless to do so.<br\/><br\/>\"XI, The administratrix, on\u00a0 presenting\u00a0 the\u00a0 alleged inventory, fraudulently omitted\u00a0 and concealed from the court and\u00a0 the creditors of the estate the fact that there existed more than sufficient property to pay the debts and that the said estate, far from\u00a0 being insolvent,\u00a0 was very valuable and comprised a good deal of property.<br\/><br\/>\"XII. The deceased, Jose Reyes y Mijares, owned at the time of his death a house on Calle Alix, No.\u00a0 150, in the city of Manila, and\u00a0 a share,\u00a0 together with\u00a0 Felipe\u00a0 Caballero, in the steam\u00a0 launch Ventura, which properties had, and have at the present time, a value of more than P30,000.<br\/><br\/>\"XIII. Moreover,\u00a0 on November 15, 1907, the said\u00a0 administratrix, together\u00a0 with her daughter,\u00a0 Leonor, executed the instrument ratified\u00a0 before the notary public, Antonio M. Opisso, which was recently filed in the probate proceedings, in which instrument she clearly acknowledges the said house and share in the launch to belong to the estate left by the deceased Jose Reyes y Mijares.<br\/><br\/>\"XIV. The\u00a0 aforementioned administratrix omitted the said properties from the inventory and gave it to be understood\u00a0 that the estate\u00a0 was insolvent,\u00a0 for\u00a0 the\u00a0 purpose of deceiving\u00a0 the creditors of the same, with\u00a0 the result that, according to the report of the\u00a0 committee to hear claims against\u00a0 and value the\u00a0 estate, which report is included in the record of the probate proceedings, not a single claim was presented.<br\/><br\/>\"XV.\u00a0 The said house and share in the launch were only included in the inventory a long while\u00a0 after the expiration of the term fixed for\u00a0 the presentation of\u00a0 claims, for the purpose\u00a0 of their allotment to the widow and her\u00a0 children and in order that they might perfect their title and\u00a0 have it recorded in the property registry, and the said inclusion was effected after\u00a0 this plaintiff\u00a0 party had presented\u00a0 a motion,\u00a0 on July\u00a0 24, 1909, praying the\u00a0 court to order the said property to be included in the inventory.<br\/><br\/>\"XVI. So well did the administratrix know of the\u00a0 existence of\u00a0 the said house that it was in it that her husband died and her children by him\u00a0 were born, and she continues up to the present\u00a0 date to reside therein.<br\/><br\/>\"XVII. Neither the administratrix nor the committee of appraisal has complied\u00a0 with her or its duty to file the inventory\u00a0 and appraisement as prescribed in\u00a0 sections\u00a0 688, 689, and\u00a0 670 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions, and the former,\u00a0 with the purpose of deceiving the\u00a0 creditors, presented a statement of some furniture, without appraisement whatever, many articles of which might be included within the provisions of section 671 as property which may not be inventoried, and consequently\u00a0 not\u00a0 subject to the payment of debts.<br\/><br\/>\"XVIII.\u00a0 The plaintiff was entirely unaware of the fact that the deceased\u00a0 had left property of any importance until the last part of June\u00a0 of the\u00a0 present year,\u00a0 when, by a chance, the fact was divulged to it.<br\/><br\/>\"XIX.\u00a0 The fictitious\u00a0 administration of the estate is still in course, none of the properties pertaining thereto having been divided up to this date, which properties in fact have never been administered.<br\/><br\/>\"XX.\u00a0 The fact is that there never has been an administration of \u00a3he property of the deceased, and that of which a pretense was made to begin and perform\u00a0 was false and fraudulent.\u00a0\u00a0 An attempt was made merely to comply with the letter of the\u00a0 law, the mandates\u00a0 of which were abused in order to affirm the fraud and assure the benefit thereby derived,\u00a0 while\u00a0 at the same time the entire spirit and substance of the legal provisions applicable to the administration of intestate estates was eluded and not complied with.<br\/><br\/>\"XXI. The desire to defraud the\u00a0 creditors, as\u00a0 stated\u00a0 in the preceding paragraphs, has been\u00a0 the sole\u00a0 motive of the proceedings initiated by the administratrix, who never has had the intention.to administer the property of the deceased; in other words, there has been an administration\u00a0 on paper and in form, but in reality and in fact there never has been one.<br\/><br\/>\"XXII. The administratrix, being cognizant of the deceit that had been practiced upon the plaintiff party and of the latter's belief of\u00a0 the complete insolvency of the deceased, proposed nothing less than to take advantage of plaintiff's error in order that the property which belonged to the deceased might be awarded to her and to her children and not in any manner\u00a0 applied to the payment\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 debts that encumbered it.<br\/><br\/>\"XXIII. The administration had in this case was no\u00a0 more than an invention devised by the widow in order to convey the property of the deceased to his heirs, thereby defrauding the former's creditors.<br\/><br\/>\"XXIV. Reduced to its last analysis, the administration in this case amounts to nothing more than\u00a0 a disposal of the property of Jose Reyes y Mijares for the purpose of defrauding his\u00a0 creditors.<br\/><br\/>\"Therefore, the plaintiff prays\u00a0 the court,\u00a0 after the\u00a0 issuance of summons\u00a0 to the defendants in accordance\u00a0 with law, to order:<br\/><br\/>\"1. That the committee of appraisal\u00a0 and claims be renewed,\u00a0 and that the\u00a0 term within\u00a0 which claims may\u00a0 be presented and heard be extended.<br\/><br\/>\"2. That in\u00a0 case the committee can not be renewed the proceeding's already had in connection with the administration of the estate of the deceased Jose Reyes y Mijares be set aside\u00a0 and annulled, and that\u00a0 a new administrator\u00a0 be appointed who shall proceed with the administration of the said estate as if no proceedings had ever been had therein.<br\/><br\/>\"3. That, in case neither of the remedies above requested can\u00a0 be granted, the defendants shall pay to the plaintiff party damages to the\u00a0 amount of the debt which they owe to it on account of their\u00a0 fraud; that the property left by the said deceased Jose Reyes y Mijares\u00a0 shall be\u00a0 especially subject\u00a0 to the payment directed to\u00a0 be\u00a0 made\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 said judgment, and\u00a0 that in\u00a0 any case the partition prayed for in the probate proceedings be denied until the questions raised in this suit shall have been decided.<br\/><br\/>\"4. The plaintiff also prays the court to grant him any further\u00a0 remedy or\u00a0 protection which, in\u00a0 view of\u00a0 the facts, justice may demand.\"<\/blockquote>Accompanying the said\u00a0 motion were several exhibits presented in support of the facts alleged in said motion.\u00a0\u00a0 (See bill of exceptions, pp. 25-31.)<br\/><br\/>In opposition to said motion the\u00a0 attorney for the administratrix presented\u00a0 the affidavits of several persons\u00a0 (see bill of exceptions, pp. 31-39), the most important of them being that of Antonio M. Opisso, which is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Antonio M.

The record does not disclose whether it was presented before or after the report of the commissioners,\u00a0 relating to claims, above referred to.\u00a0 The record does not disclose whether the report of the commissioners showing the appraised value of the estate\u00a0 of the deceased was presented before or after the time had elapsed for the presentation of claims\u00a0 against the estate.<br\/><br\/>On the 23d\u00a0 of July, 1909, long after the time for the presentation of the claims against\u00a0 the\u00a0 said estate, the administratrix made a report (bill of exceptions p.\u00a0 18) amending her inventory so as to include a house of strong materials located at No. 150 Calle Alix, district of Sampaloc, city of Manila, as well as the launch Ventura.\u00a0 From this additional report it is made to appear that the administratrix did not\u00a0 know\u00a0 that these two\u00a0 properties belonged\u00a0 to the estate until some time\u00a0 after the first inventory had\u00a0 been made. This contention of the administratrix is\u00a0 not tenable for the reason that from a public\u00a0 document presented in this court (Rollo 21) it appears that the said administratrix, by a public instrument, purchased the interest of one of the children\u00a0 of the intestate in said properties\u00a0 on the 15th of November, 1907, a few months after the said commissioners made their\u00a0 final report, and after the expiration of the period for the presentation of claims.\u00a0 The contention that the,administratrix did not know that these properties belonged to the estate which she was administering is further refuted by the fact that on the\u00a0 31st\u00a0 of December, 1906, a few months after the death of\u00a0 her husband,\u00a0 she\u00a0 paid the sum of 1M43.23 as taxes upon real property,\u00a0 and there is no proof offered\u00a0 by\u00a0 her to show that there was any other real property belonging to the estate besides\u00a0 the\u00a0 property in said Calle Alix.<br\/><br\/>Under these facts and others the\u00a0 Hon.\u00a0 A.\u00a0 S. Crossfield ordered that a new\u00a0 commission be appointed\u00a0 for\u00a0 the purpose of appraising\u00a0 the\u00a0 additional property\u00a0 not\u00a0 included in the first inventory and to hear claims against\u00a0 the said estate, to\u00a0 the extent of the additional property.\u00a0 The appellant contends that the lower court committed an error in ordering the appointment of a\u00a0 new commission, upon the theory that all claims\u00a0 not\u00a0 presented\u00a0 within the time provided for by law were barred under the provisions of section 695 of the Code of Procedure in Civil\u00a0 Actions.<br\/><br\/>From a\u00a0 full examination of the record brought to this court,\u00a0 we are of the opinion\u00a0 and so hold that\u00a0 the failure of the\u00a0 administratrix\u00a0 to include\u00a0 in\u00a0 her\u00a0 inventory,\u00a0 under the circumstances in the present case, property which she knew belonged to the estate, whether\u00a0 intentional or not, was a fraud against the creditors of the said estate.<br\/><br\/>Claimants against an estate have a\u00a0 right to\u00a0 rely\u00a0 upon the correctness of the inventory presented by the administrator, etc., and if the administrator knowingly and willfully omits to include\u00a0 property in\u00a0 the\u00a0 inventory which should be included\u00a0 and thus\u00a0 induces claimants\u00a0 not\u00a0 to\u00a0 present their claims\u00a0 within\u00a0 the period prescribed by\u00a0 law, the\u00a0 probate court, being\u00a0 a court of equity,\u00a0 should,\u00a0 upon proof of that fact,\u00a0 extend\u00a0 the time\u00a0 for\u00a0 the presentation of\u00a0 claims.\u00a0 If the commission originally appointed\u00a0 had been discharged, the court should appoint a new commission to\u00a0 appraise the estate\u00a0 and to hear claims.\u00a0\u00a0 The moment the probate court\u00a0 discovers\u00a0 that fraud has been\u00a0 committed by\u00a0 the administrator or the commission, he may set aside all that has\u00a0 been done\u00a0 and commence\u00a0 de novo, except\u00a0 in\u00a0 cases where vested rights have been created in good faith.<br\/><br\/>Fraud vitiates all transactions which it touches.\u00a0\u00a0 (Stoddard\u00a0 <i>vs.<\/i> Chambers, 2\u00a0 How.\u00a0 (U, S.), 284; Dos Hermanos, 2 Wheat.\u00a0 (U. S.)&gt; 76; Graffam <i>vs<\/i>. Burgess, 117 U. S, 180; Kerr on Fraud, 51.)<br\/><br\/>If a transaction\u00a0 has been originally founded on\u00a0 fraud, the original vice will continue to taint it, however long the negotiations may continue or into whatever ramifications it may\u00a0 extend.\u00a0 No length of time however great will be a bar to relief if the injured party has been in ignorance of the fraud.\u00a0 (Graffam\u00a0 <i>vs.<\/i> Burgess\u00a0 (<i>supra<\/i>); Charter <i>vs.<\/i> Trevelyan, 11 Clark and F. (English Reports), 714; Michoud <i>vs.<\/i> Girod, 45 U. S.,\u00a0 503, 561; Duchess of Kingston, 20 How. St. Trials, 544.)<br\/><br\/>Where fraud is such as to prevent a party from presenting the merits of his\u00a0 case to the court or works an imposition upon\u00a0 the jurisdiction of the court, the judgment rendered in\u00a0 such a\u00a0 case may be impeached.\u00a0\u00a0 (Steel <i>vs<\/i>. St, Louis Ry. Co.,\u00a0 106\u00a0 U.\u00a0 S., 389.)<br\/><br\/>In the case of Tibbetts <i>vs.<\/i> Tilton (31 N. H., 273)\u00a0 it was held that\u00a0 a creditor of an estate was allowed to avoid the decree of discharge by showing that a part of the estate of the intestate had been fraudulently kept back by the administrator and not reported in the inventory.<br\/><br\/>In the case of Bank <i>vs. <\/i>Fairbanks (49 N. H., 131) it was\u00a0 held\u00a0 that the bar for the presentation of claims did not apply to a case where the claimant\u00a0 against an\u00a0 estate had been\u00a0 induced not to present his claim, and\u00a0 where the administrator\u00a0 had in his\u00a0 possession property not\u00a0 included in the inventory.<br\/><br\/>Where a creditor of an insolvent estate which has been closed\u00a0 neglected to exhibit\u00a0 his claim\u00a0 within the time allowed, if he afterwards\u00a0 discover and show to the administrator other estate not before inventoried, he may sustain an action for the recovery of his claim.\u00a0\u00a0 (Sacket <i>vs<\/i>.\u00a0 Mead, 1 Conn., 13; Thorn <i>vs.<\/i> Watson, 10 111., 26; Stone <i>vs.<\/i> Clarke, 40 III., 411; Chase <i>vs<\/i>. Beeson, 92 Ind., 61.)<br\/><br\/>In the case of Henry <i>vs<\/i>. Bey (114\u00a0 Iowa, 454) it was held that when the owner of a note against decedent waa induced to withhold the filing\u00a0 of his claim by false and fraudulent representations of the executor as to the solvency of the estate, and the estate is still unsettled, the court will permit\u00a0 the\u00a0 filing of the claim, notwithstanding that the statutory time therefor has expired.\u00a0 (State <i>vs<\/i>. Smith, 79 Minn., 257.)<br\/><br\/>In the case of Dariano <i>vs<\/i>. Fidalgo (14 Phil. Rep., 62) this court held that;<br\/><blockquote>\"Courts of probate\u00a0 jurisdiction should\u00a0 be very jealous in guarding the estates of| deceased persons, and when the action\u00a0 of any party connected with the administration of such estate\u00a0 is tainted with fraud in the\u00a0 slightest degree such courts should take jurisdiction for\u00a0 the purpose of remedying whatever injury the estate may have suffered.\"<\/blockquote>For\u00a0 all of the foregoing reasons, we are of the opinion and so hold that the petition of the defendant asking for the appointment of a new\u00a0 commission to appraise the estate of the deceased Jose\u00a0 Reyes y Mijares and\u00a0 to hear claims against said estate should\u00a0 have been granted, and to that extent\u00a0 the judgment of the lower court is\u00a0 hereby modified and it is hereby ordered and directed\u00a0 that\u00a0 the record be returned to the lower court and that said commission be appointed, with direction to proceed to appraise the property of said estate and to hear claims against it, in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, and also that the said administratrix be required to add to her inventory such\u00a0 other\u00a0 property, not\u00a0 already included, as may be found to belong to said estate:\u00a0 Provided, however. That the lower court may accept the appraisement of the property heretofore inventoried, if he desires\u00a0 so to do. It is so ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano,\u00a0 C.

The acts which resulted in the death of the deceased were perpetrated with perfidy and treachery, as the\u00a0 aggressor employed means, ways, and forms for the direct purpose of assuring the consummation of both crimes without risk to his person such as might have arisen from any defense his victims might have been able to make.<br\/><br\/>Although the defendant\u00a0 Liwakas did not testify in the Court of First Instance, yet, by the testimony of\u00a0 the judge of the tribal ward court it is shown that in the preliminary investigation the accused pleaded guilty to the said crime, and in connection with his plea\u00a0 made the following statements : A long while before the crime, and according to a custom of his tribe,\u00a0 he bought the girl named Camaning, who was about 10 years of age, from a man called\u00a0 Magaiion, the girl's true father and the husband of the deceased Santanan.\u00a0 The latter, a long time before, had separated from her husband and joined one named Mamacao, with whom she was then living.\u00a0 In order to marry the said girl he had to deliver, as a sablat, effects to the value of about P30 and two agunes.\u00a0 After his wife had been living with him, and with whom he had carnal communication,\u00a0 and on an occasion when he went to the hills to gather copal gum, he left his wife Camaning in the house of a woman named Atang, in the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">sitio<\/span> of Tubotubo.\u00a0 On\u00a0 his return he did not find his wife, because she had been taken\u00a0 away by her mother, Santanan.\u00a0 He therefore went to see the latter in the house of Mamacao, with whom\u00a0 she\u00a0 was living,\u00a0 and demanded the return of the sablat which he had paid for the girl.\u00a0 This, Mamacao refused to do, whereupon the accused sought the Moros Icus, Nalayo, and Casapat, in order that they might intervene as friendly arbitrators; but Mamacao refused to compromise, saying that if his\u00a0 lance\u00a0 should tell him\u00a0 to return the price, he would return it, otherwise he would not. Thereupon, Mamacao looked,at the lance he was holding in his hand, and, the accused being displeased with Mamacao's answer and having heard the advice given him by Maganon, that he should take the law into his own hands, sharpened his bolo in the afternoon and that night entered the house of the deceased and killed them both in the manner related by the only eyewitness, Camaning.<br\/><br\/>The latter\u00a0 said that on the night of\u00a0 the crime she was asleep in the house where her mother was living and was awakened\u00a0 by the noise\u00a0 occasioned by\u00a0 the\u00a0 assault.\u00a0 This witness also stated that, after the perpetration of the crime, the aggressor Liwakas caught her and\u00a0 carried her\u00a0 out of the house into a wood where by force he had carnal connection with\u00a0 her twice, and that on one occasion, after they had been living together, she managed to escape from\u00a0 the power of the\u00a0 accused and took refuge in the house of a man named Melecio.<br\/><br\/>The witnesses\u00a0 Ilaya, Masapat,\u00a0 and Icus affirmed that Liwakas by his having delivered a sabkit to. the parents of the girl Camaning succeeded in marrying her,\u00a0 and\u00a0 one of them stated that the latter had assured him that she was the wife of Liwakas; but the girl\u00a0 Camaning in her sworn testimony denied that she was the wife of the accused and said that she was unmarried and had not been asked in marriage by the defendant Liwakas. ,\u00a0 She also alleged that she had not\u00a0 yet menstruated; that before she\u00a0 was raped she had had no carnal relations with the accused, and that on the night of the assault two other minors, named Enrique and Rosita,\u00a0 were also in the house\u00a0 and\u00a0 fled on\u00a0 being awakened\u00a0 by the disturbance therein.<br\/><br\/>From the foregoing facts it is concluded that the accused is the proved principal, by direct\u00a0 participation, fully convicted of\u00a0 the double murder under prosecution, for\u00a0 the testimony of\u00a0 the witnesses and all the circumstantial evidence of the\u00a0 case confirm the statements made by him in explaining\u00a0 his conduct and produce in the mind the most complete conviction, beyond all doubt, of the defendant's guilt.<br\/><br\/>In the matter of the perpetration of the crime it is proper to consider the\u00a0 presence of the aggravating circumstances 7, 15, 20, and 21 of article 10 of the Penal Code, as it was shown that Liwakas commenced to sharpen\u00a0 his bolo on the afternoon\u00a0 immediately\u00a0 preceding\u00a0 the\u00a0 night of\u00a0 the crime, which indicated that, from that time, he thought of and determined upon committing the said murders and did with premeditation deliberately resolve to\u00a0 deprive the\u00a0 deceased Mamacao and Santanan of their lives, thus preparing, by those overt acts,\u00a0 the execution of the crime, which he committed by availing himself of the darkness and silence of the night at a time when the deceased were sound asleep. The defendant\u00a0 killed his\u00a0 victims in\u00a0 their\u00a0 own dwelling, which he entered by\u00a0 scaling the wall and passing through one\u00a0 of\u00a0 the windows, not a way intended for entrance. Even though the special circumstance provided in article 11 of the Penal Code be considered,\u00a0 in view\u00a0 of the\u00a0 race, ferocious and savage\u00a0 habits of the culprit, and his lack of education,\u00a0 this\u00a0 extenuating\u00a0 circumstance\u00a0 is\u00a0\u00a0 completely counterbalanced by one of the aforesaid aggravating circumstances, only one of the latter being thus compensated for and the three others still remaining in force; wherefore the penalty specified by law must be imposed in its maximum degree.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the errors attributed to the judgment submitted to this court for review, it must be\u00a0 borne\u00a0 in mind that Liwakas was not charged in the complaint with any of the acts that constitute the crimes of abduction or rape, and, although the eyewitness of the said murders testified that she was taken into a wood and there raped by the\u00a0 accused, this\u00a0 fact is not the subject of\u00a0 this cause,\u00a0 nor can it be considered in reaching the decision to be rendered herein, for the reason that it was not alleged in the complaint.<br\/><br\/>In view\u00a0 of the statement of the acts committed by the accused, as well as of the circumstances which accompanied the perpetration of the crime, two of which, those of premeditation and treachery, are specific and either of them qualify the crime of homicide by converting it into one of murder, it would be improper, without considering them, to admit the allegation of the defense that only a crime of double homicide, and not one of double\u00a0 murder, was committed.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the alleged\u00a0 error of the lower court in failing to consider circumstance 5 of article 9 of the Penal Code, on account of the said crimes having been committed in vindication of a grave offense caused to the perpetrator of the\u00a0 murders, it is sufficient for\u00a0 the purposes of this decision to state that, even admitting\u00a0 as\u00a0 true the facts alleged by the\u00a0 accused\u00a0 and,\u00a0 notwithstanding the savage customs of those of his\u00a0 race,\u00a0 as\u00a0 there\u00a0 was a constituted authority in\u00a0 the place before whom they could apply,\u00a0 the conduct of Mamacao and of Camaning's mother could never justify the violent death of the deceased, nor would it have been lawful to have permitted Liwakas to take the law into his own hands\u00a0 to avenge his pretended injury.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, and in view of Act No. 1577, it is proper, in our opinion, to affirm the judgment reviewed whereby the Manobo\u00a0 Liwakas is sentenced to the death penalty, which shall be executed in the square of the pueblo, or in such other place as the governor of the province shall designate;\u00a0 provided,\u00a0 moreover,\u00a0 that in case\u00a0 the\u00a0 death penalty imposed should not be carried into effect,\u00a0 on account of the culprit's\u00a0 being pardoned, he shall be sentenced to the accessory penalties prescribed\u00a0 by article 53 of the Penal Code, with suppression of the indemnity of P500 to the girl Camaning for the\u00a0 crimes of abduction and rape which were not the subject of this cause, the costs of this instance to be charged against the defendant.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

They both left this house and met shortly afterwards in the\u00a0 street\u00a0 (Verdades)\u00a0 in said barrio.\u00a0\u00a0 On meeting\u00a0 there they became engaged in a quarrel, the appellant knocking or pushing Rabe\u00a0 down, then proceeded to maltreat him. At\u00a0 this\u00a0 moment\u00a0 Rabe\u00a0 called \"police!\u00a0 police!\" Gregorio Glindo, a municipal policeman of Pitogo, being on patrol duty that night in said barrio, hearing these words went to the\u00a0 scene, arriving just as the offended\u00a0 party was getting up, and attempted to arrest the appellant, saying to\u00a0 him: \"In\u00a0 the name of the United States, don't move.\"\u00a0 The appellant, on seeing the policeman and hearing this command, said: \"Don't come near, because I will take your life.\"\u00a0 The policeman continued toward the appellant and when very near him the appellant struck at the policeman with a knife. On account of this resistance the policeman could not arrest the appellant\u00a0 at that time, so he went immediately to the house of the councilman of that barrio, Demetrio Pandenio, and\u00a0 reported the\u00a0 matter.\u00a0 Pandenio ordered him to arrest the appellant.\u00a0 He returned to obey this order, being fol- lowed by Pandenio.\u00a0\u00a0 They found\u00a0 the appellant in a\u00a0 place called Mutingbayan.\u00a0\u00a0 The policeman attempted to take hold of the\u00a0 appellant, but he resisted, striking at the policeman again with\u00a0 his knife.\u00a0 The councilman\u00a0 then\u00a0 ordered the appellant to submit himself, and on receiving this order the appellant said: \"I\u00a0 do not recognize\u00a0 anyone,\"\u00a0 and struck at the councilman with the knife.<br\/><br\/>The appellant was not arrested on that night on account of this resistance.\u00a0\u00a0 He did not lay hands on or touch\u00a0 with his knife either the policeman or the councilman, but he did refuse\u00a0 to submit himself to the\u00a0 authorities, and resisted arrest.\u00a0 The policeman did not see the appellant knock the priest down, neither did he see him kick the said priest, but he heard the cries of the priest calling for help, saying \"police! police!\"\u00a0 and when he arrived\u00a0 on the scene the priest was\u00a0 just getting up and\u00a0 freeing himself from the appellant.\u00a0\u00a0 When the policeman\u00a0 heard these cries for help he was only a very short distance - some 6 or 8 <i>brazas<\/i> away, and when he arrived the trouble had not terminated, although\u00a0 no active\u00a0 fighting took place\u00a0 after\u00a0 his arrival. Under these facts and circumstances it was the duty of this police officer to stop this disturbance by\u00a0 placing the defendant under arrest.<br\/><br\/>Any officer charged witht. the preservation of the\u00a0 public peace\u00a0 may arrest, without a\u00a0 warrant, any person who is committing, or has committed, a brach of the peace in his presence.\u00a0\u00a0 (3 Cyc, 881; Carolina <i>vs<\/i>.

Rep., 805.)<br\/><br\/>An offense is committed in the presence or within the view of an officer, within the meaning of the rule authorizing an arrest without a warrant, when the officer sees\u00a0 the offense, although at a distance, or hears the disturbances created thereby and proceeds at once to\u00a0 the scene thereof; or the offense is continuing, or has not been consummated,\u00a0 at the time the arrest is made.\u00a0 (3 Cyc, 886; Ramsey<i> vs.<\/i>\u00a0 State, 17 S.\u00a0 E.,\u00a0 613; Dilger<i> vs<\/i>.

SILVESTRE QUILLO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/>\n<br\/>\nD E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">On the night of February 3,1909, Antonio Serrano, living at No. 194 Calle Magallanes, Intramuros, left his\u00a0 house in company with his wife to go to\u00a0 the\u00a0 Carnival, leaving his two servants, Alberto Concepcion and Eulogio Pena, in the house and locking the gate.\u00a0 At about 11 o'clock of the same night, Patrolman Charles G. Smith\u00a0 received information that there was a wounded man in the house; he immediately proceeded to the place and found a man covered with blood lying on the ground in the interior patio; he was obliged to force open the locked gate in order to remove the wounded man, who proved to be Alberto Concepcion, one of the house boys, and to conduct him to the hospital of San Juan de Dios, where he died within an hour after arrival.<br\/><br\/>An examination of the body of the deceased showed many wounds:\u00a0 one\u00a0 about 10\u00a0 centimeters long and half a centimeter deep\u00a0 on the forehead; another of similar size\u00a0 on the right side of the forehead; another about 12\u00a0 centimeters long over the left ear; another over the superficial temporal artery, which was severed; another in the left occipital region ; another at the back of the neck which penetrated the spinal vertebrae, severing all the muscles of the neck; two wounds of 5 centimeters in length on the right forearm; another on\u00a0 the left wrist; two other wounds in the right forearm,\u00a0 and one wound on the little finger of the right hand.\u00a0 According to the surgeon who made the examination, the majority of the above-described wounds were necessarily fatal\u00a0 and sufficient to have caused death; there were other wounds of less importance on the body.\u00a0 The\u00a0 doctor who examined the\u00a0 body\u00a0 testified to these wounds at the trial.<br\/><br\/>According to Eulogio Pena, the only eyewitness\u00a0 of the affray, the violent death of the victim occurred as follows: Pena that night was waiting at the grated door of the house for the newspaper, after the\u00a0 departure\u00a0 of his masters, when Silvestre Quillo\u00a0 approached him from\u00a0 the\u00a0 street, asking if his employers had gone out, to\u00a0 which he answered in the affirmative.\u00a0 After this Quillo left and the servant Pena\u00a0 went\u00a0 upstairs to\u00a0 the dining room, from whence he saw that Quillo, by means of a ladder, had climbed over the fence and with a\u00a0 bolo in his hand was going in the\u00a0 direction of the\u00a0 servants' quarters on the ground floor of the house; Alberto Concepcion was there at the time, sitting on a trunk and reading a book; there was a\u00a0 light in the room, and when the witness went to the window of the kitchen, he saw\u00a0 that Quillo\u00a0 was attacking his\u00a0 fellow-servant\u00a0 Concepcion, but notwithstanding the cries of the\u00a0 latter he dared not go to assist\u00a0 him as he wanted to do, because the aggressor had threatened to kill him if he\u00a0 came near; being afraid, he went back to the dining room and from there he saw\u00a0 Silvestre Quillo place\u00a0 a ladder against\u00a0 the wall and climb over\u00a0 the fence and out of the house; at about 11.30 p. m. his master arrived with several policemen, he being asleep through fear at the time.<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing facts,\u00a0 as alleged, a complaint was filed with the Court of First Instance of Manila charging Silvestre Quillo, who was later\u00a0 on arrested, with\u00a0 the crime of murder, and these proceedings were instituted; on the 13th of February,\u00a0 1909,\u00a0 the trial court\u00a0 rendered judgment therein sentencing\u00a0 the defendant to\u00a0 the\u00a0 penalty\u00a0 of <i> cadena perpetua<\/i>, with costs, from which\u00a0 judgment he\u00a0 appealed.<br\/><br\/>From the above-stated facts, fully proven in this case, it appears beyond a\u00a0 doubt, that the\u00a0 crime of murder was committed,\u00a0 inasmuch as Alberto Concepcion was attacked with\u00a0 a\u00a0 sharp, cutting weapon, at a\u00a0 time\u00a0 when he had\u00a0 his back\u00a0 turned to the aggressor and while sitting on a trunk with\u00a0 his body bent\u00a0 over his knees reading a\u00a0 book by means of a light in the room.\u00a0\u00a0 Patrolman Hartpence, who was the first to\u00a0 enter the room, found the book open upon the floor with\u00a0 blood\u00a0 stains on page\u00a0 45,\u00a0 which detail\u00a0 confirms the statement by Pefia, the other\u00a0 servant in the house and the only eyewitness of the occurrence.\u00a0 And even though doubts were\u00a0 entertained\u00a0 as to the latter's statement, that the aggressor attacked\u00a0 his victim from behind, considering the report of the surgeon who examined the wounds of\u00a0 the deceased at the hospital of San Juan de Dios,\u00a0 yet it is undeniable that, being seated and busy reading, entirely unaware and. unarmed, he\u00a0 was suddenly attacked by the aggressor who\u00a0 was carrying a bolo, and in view of the numerous wounds inflicted on him, some of them of a serious character and necessarily mortal, it appears that the deceased was attacked treacherously, because the aggressor employed ways and means in\u00a0 the commission\u00a0 of the crime tending directly and particularly to insure its consummation without any risk to his person which might arise from a defense by the injured\u00a0 party who, unquestionably, was unable to execute any such act or even to flee because, being seriously wounded in the back of the neck, as\u00a0 stated by the witness Pena, or in the forehead and\u00a0 left side\u00a0 of the face as the said surgeon believed, the assaulted man was at once incapacitated and could not defend himself,\u00a0 and the aggressor, by the superiority and advantage he had obtained, was free to continue\u00a0 his acts until he left the\u00a0 assaulted man almost dead.<br\/><br\/>The crime therefore falls within the provisions of article 403 of the\u00a0 Penal Code.\u00a0 The\u00a0 defendant, Silvestre Quillo, pleaded not guilty, and although he\u00a0 did not testify in the case,\u00a0 his counsel presented Maria Rodriguez as a witness to prove an alibi, and the latter declared that the said defendant was in her house and slept\u00a0 in it, although he did not usually\u00a0 do so, from 8 o'clock on the night of the affair until\u00a0 4 o'clock of the following morning, when he left to return to his own dwelling.<br\/><br\/>The foregoing testimony,\u00a0 which is insufficient of itself, has been contradicted by Patrolman Hartpence, who had a conversation with her regarding the\u00a0 hour at which the defendant Quillo arrived at her house; Rodriguez assured the policeman that she\u00a0 could not fix the hour at which the defendant reached her house because she did not have a clock, and she then said nothing\u00a0 about having heard bells strike, which she thought indicated 8\u00a0 o'clock, when the defendant arrived at her house.\u00a0\u00a0 At any rate the testimony of the said Maria Rodriguez is not at all sufficient to destroy the testimony of the eyewitness to the crime, Eulogio\u00a0 Pena, the only person\u00a0 who was in the house where it took place; the testimony of the aforesaid eyewitness\u00a0 is corroborated by other circumstantial evidence which, together with that of the said eyewitness, produce in the mind a full conviction, beyond all doubt, of the guilt of Silvestre Quillo as the sole principal in the murder herein prosecuted.<br\/><br\/>In fact, it is\u00a0 proven that at 4 o'clock of the morning following the night when the murder was\u00a0 committed, the defendant appeared at the door of the house of Gaspar Justinbaste situated in\u00a0 Calle Magallanes, 151, close\u00a0 to that where the affair happened, wherein he lived, and when trying to enter it, after cautiously looking all around, he saw Policeman Catalino Fernandez who was there seated on a bench awaiting his\u00a0 return; that he then tried to escape, but the policeman cautioned him not to run away and caught him by the arm and asked him his name; that he first said his name was Pedro, and later on that it was Juan,\u00a0 and only when Eulogio Pena was brought before him in\u00a0 order to identify\u00a0 him, did he give his\u00a0 true name; that the\u00a0 bolo, which the defendant used\u00a0 in the assault, was afterwards found\u00a0 in a box outside\u00a0 of\u00a0 the room where the crime was committed, and upon its being presented to Gaspar Justinbaste,\u00a0 in whose house the accused lived, it was recognized as the one that he had and which disappeared three weeks previously, for\u00a0 which reason he had given it up\u00a0 for\u00a0 lost; said witness called attention to the fact that the bolo, upon examination,\u00a0 proved to be sharper than before its disappearance; that, according to the\u00a0 declaration\u00a0 of Policeman Hartpence, the\u00a0 interior of\u00a0 the room where the crime was committed could\u00a0 be seen and\u00a0 examined from the\u00a0 window of the kitchen on the upper floor of the house, which confirms the statement of witness Pena; that the latter asserted that on the\u00a0 night of the murder the accused wore black trousers, and as a result of the search made by Policeman Catalino Fernandez in the house where the defendant lived, the black trousers were found with blood stains on them, and were identified\u00a0 by Pena and by Antonio Serrano,\u00a0 who formerly owned\u00a0 the trousers\u00a0 and gave the\u00a0 same to his servants, although he did not know which one had secured them, but supposed that it was the accused Quillo, who was in his employ at the time, and was one of the servants of the house, from which he afterwards departed.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the motive\u00a0 that gave\u00a0 rise to the attacK upon the unfortunate Alberto Concepcion, none can be found in the record, with the exception of the facts stated by Eulogio Pena, a fellow-servant of the deceased, who says that, a few days before, some trouble had arisen between the deceased and\u00a0 the defendant, because the former had not given the latter certain\u00a0 money that\u00a0 Quillo had requested from Concepcion; such a motive was too insignificant to warrant the killing of the latter, and it shows the degree of perversity of the murderer.<br\/><br\/>In the commission of the crime the presence of aggravating circumstances\u00a0 Nos. 15 and 20 of article 10 of the Penal Code must be considered, inasmuch\u00a0 as the\u00a0 defendant\u00a0 undoubtedly and expressly selected and waited for the darkness of night in order to successfully carry out his criminal intent, and perpetrated the crime in the dwelling of the victim. These two\u00a0 circumstances are\u00a0 counteracted\u00a0 by\u00a0 the special circumstance established by article 11 of the Penal\u00a0 Code, for the\u00a0 reason that Silvestre Quillo is a native of these Islands and of hardly any education, which circumstance may properly be considered because the present case is not\u00a0 one of robbery with homicide, or of murder and robbery, and the complaint only charges\u00a0 the accused with the crime of murder. And, notwithstanding the fact that in the room where the murder occurred a trunk was found open with all the clothing therein mixed up and with blood stains thereon, it has not been shown that the crime of\u00a0 robbery was committed,\u00a0 and whether beyond\u00a0 the two P5 bills found inside a piece of red paper\u00a0 among the clothes, money or other goods had been stolen; therefore\u00a0 it can not be\u00a0 concluded with certainty that the\u00a0 crime\u00a0 of\u00a0 robbery was\u00a0 committed.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, it is\u00a0 our opinion that the judgment appealed from should be and is hereby affirmed with the costs against the appellant, provided, however, that he shall further be sentenced to suffer the accessory penalties Nos. 2 and 3 of article 54 of the Penal Code, and to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of P1,000 and that the two P5 bills shall\u00a0 be delivered to\u00a0 the latter if\u00a0 it has not\u00a0 already been done.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i> Arellano, C.\u00a0 J., Mapa, Johnson,\u00a0 Carson,<\/i> and\u00a0 <i>Moreland, JJ., <\/i>concur.<br\/><\/div>",

The defendants appealed.<br\/><br\/>It appears clearly established from the proofs in this case that on the 5th day of November, 1907, a general election was held in the municipality of Sanchez Mira in the Province of\u00a0 Cagayan.\u00a0 In\u00a0 said election\u00a0 Felipe Navarro and Juan Academia were\u00a0 opposing candidates for the office\u00a0 of municipal president and Mariano Acu\u00f1a and Cosme Marzan were opposing candidates for the office of municipal vice-president.\u00a0\u00a0 Upon\u00a0 a\u00a0 count of the\u00a0 ballots\u00a0 by the board of inspectors\u00a0 after the polls were closed, it was found that Juan Academia\u00a0 had\u00a0 been\u00a0 elected\u00a0 president and Cosme Marzan\u00a0 vice-president of said municipality.\u00a0 At about 8 o'clock in the evening after the count had been made, the inspectors\u00a0 delivered to the municipal secretary, Liberato Lopez, some blank ballots and other papers, together with the ballot boxes used in said election, which ballot boxes, duly locked and sealed, contained the ballots voted at said election.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 said municipal secretary, finding his office locked with a padlock, the key of which was in the possession of his clerk, sent word to the latter, and, after waiting an hour or so, the\u00a0 inspectors being in a hurry and the clerk not appearing, Lopez took an iron bar from the door and the policeman,\u00a0 Antonio Pulido, broke the lock on the door, obtaining by this method entrance to the office.\u00a0 The municipal secretary\u00a0 put into his\u00a0 wardrobe\u00a0 the papers and the ballot boxes and locked the\u00a0 wardrobe with a key which he took away with him to the house of Felipe Navarro, where he was stopping.\u00a0 He first,\u00a0 however, charged the chief of police that\u00a0 he\u00a0 keep\u00a0 careful watch of\u00a0 the office inasmuch as one of the bars of the door was\u00a0 broken.\u00a0 At about\u00a0 10 o'clock of the same night, the 5th of November, 1907, while said Liberato Lopez\u00a0 was chatting with his landlord, there came to the house where he was the two brothers, Lazaro Pulido and Antonio Pulido, the latter saying\u00a0 that they came to get an empty demijohn which was inside\u00a0 of Lopez's room.\u00a0 He entered the room on the pretext of getting the demijohn and soon came out again, <i>but without the\u00a0 demijohn.<\/i>\u00a0 Both of the brothers\u00a0 then left the house.\u00a0 On going to bed that night Lopez looked for the keys to the wardrobe in order to place them under his pillow, as was his custom, and\u00a0 found\u00a0 that they\u00a0 had\u00a0 disappeared.\u00a0\u00a0 He\u00a0 immediately went to\u00a0 the municipal building, where,\u00a0 on\u00a0 arriving, he found open the door\u00a0 of the wardrobe in which he had left the\u00a0 papers and\u00a0 the ballot boxes under lock and key.\u00a0 Looking in the wardrobe he found that the ballot boxes and some of\u00a0 the\u00a0 papers were\u00a0 gone.\u00a0\u00a0 He\u00a0 immediately went\u00a0 to the justice\u00a0 of\u00a0 the peace\u00a0 to give information\u00a0 of the\u00a0 fact,\u00a0 returning immediately to the office, accompanied by the justice and the chief of police, Petronilo Gumabay, and a member of the Constabulary.\u00a0\u00a0 On arriving at the municipal building they verified the\u00a0 fact that the wardrobe was open and the ballot\u00a0 boxes gone.\u00a0\u00a0 They searched in\u00a0 every\u00a0 corner\u00a0 of the\u00a0 office but in vain.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 ballot\u00a0 boxes\u00a0 were not to\u00a0 be found.\u00a0 From the municipal\u00a0 building,\u00a0 on the invitation of the justice of the peace, Lopez and his companions went to the office\u00a0 of the justice for the purpose of reducing\u00a0 to writing the\u00a0 facts of the case.\u00a0 Not\u00a0 having in\u00a0 his office either ink\u00a0 or paper, they returned to the secretary's office in the municipal building and, on arriving there the second time, they\u00a0 found beneath the table in\u00a0 the secretary's office the said ballot boxes, with the locks intact.\u00a0\u00a0 Some of the papers\u00a0 were scattered\u00a0 about and the seals of the ballot boxes, having on them\u00a0 the initials of\u00a0 the president of the board of inspectors, torn, so\u00a0 that, in spite\u00a0 of the fact that the ballot\u00a0 boxes\u00a0 were locked, yet it was\u00a0 possible to put ballots\u00a0 into\u00a0 the\u00a0 boxes by means\u00a0 of the\u00a0 openings from which the seals had been torn.\u00a0 The election being subsequently protested\u00a0 by\u00a0 Felipe. Navarro\u00a0 under the\u00a0 direction of the accused Salustiano Pulido, it\u00a0 was declared null and void\u00a0 by the\u00a0 Court of First\u00a0 Instance of the Province\u00a0 of Cagayan.<br\/><br\/>That\u00a0 the accused were the\u00a0 authors of the said crime\u00a0 is fully established by the above facts as proved by the prosecution,\u00a0 taken in connection with the testimony of the other witnesses for the prosecution, among whom were Eustaquio Academia and Paulo Galicia,\u00a0 who testified\u00a0 that between 10 and\u00a0 11\u00a0 o'clock of\u00a0 the night in question, being together at the house of\u00a0 Cosme Marzan, vice-president-elect,\u00a0 for the purpose of congratulating him, they on\u00a0 their way home saw in\u00a0 the street in\u00a0 front of the municipal building the defendants, Salustiano Pulido, Lazaro Pulido, and Antonio Pulido,\u00a0 the first carrying some papers and the other two a\u00a0 ballot box each,\u00a0 walking in a direction opposite to that in which the two witnesses were going.\u00a0\u00a0 That\u00a0 the said witnesses recognized\u00a0 the defendants by the light which came from\u00a0 the\u00a0 municipal building and\u00a0 because the\u00a0 night was light.\u00a0\u00a0 That when they asked the defendants why they were carrying ballot boxes, they did not answer.<br\/><br\/>There appears no reason why the conclusion of the court below should be disturbed.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below is, therefore, affirmed, with costs against the appellants.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.\u00a0 J.,\u00a0 Torres, Mapa,\u00a0 Johnson, Carson,<\/i> and <i>Elliott, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><\/div>",

That the lower court committed an error in conceding to the plaintiff, in\u00a0 his sentence, a remedy which was not prayed\u00a0 for in the complaint.<br\/><br\/>Second. That the lower court committed an error in holding that the plaintiff was\u00a0 the proper person to maintain the action in\u00a0 question.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the first assignment of error it will be noted that the plaintiff prayed that the contract of purchase be declared null\u00a0 and that the property be returned to\u00a0 her upon her\u00a0 returning to the defendant the amount of money which\u00a0 the defendant had already paid upon said contract.<br\/><br\/>The lower court rendered\u00a0 a\u00a0 judgment in favor of\u00a0 the plaintiff for one-half of\u00a0 the unpaid purchase\u00a0 price.\u00a0 The question presented\u00a0 in the petition was not even discussed by the lower court, to wit: the right of the plaintiff to have the contract declared null and the property in\u00a0 question returned to her.\u00a0\u00a0 The court, in rendering its decision, ought to have limited itself to the issues presented by the parties in their pleadings.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the\u00a0 second assignment of error,\u00a0 the defendant and appellant,\u00a0 relying upon section 685 of\u00a0 the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions, contends that the plaintiff was without authority to maintain the present action.<br\/>Said section 685 provides as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"<i>Community property<\/i>. - One-half\u00a0 the community property, as determined by the law in force in the Philippine Islands\u00a0 before the 13th day of August, 1898, belonging to a husband and wife, shall be deemed to belong to the deceased husband or\u00a0 wife, and\u00a0 shall be\u00a0 inventoried and accounted for, and distributed as a part of the estate, in\u00a0 the same manner as all other property belonging to the estate.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>This section has already been interpreted by this court in the case of Alfonso<i> vs. <\/i>Natividad (6 Phil. Rep., 240).\u00a0 In that case it was said (p. 243):<br\/><blockquote>\"This section can not be so construed as to require one-half of the property of the conjugal partnership to be inventoried as the exclusive property\u00a0 of the deceased spouse before any settlement\u00a0 of the affairs of the\u00a0 partnership. Such a construction would be in direct violation of the law, which requires that the partnership property be used to pay its debts, and provides that one-half of the net proceeds only belong to each spouse.\u00a0 (Art. 1426, Civil Code.)\u00a0\u00a0 This section (685) must mean that when the partnership affairs have been settled, and all\u00a0 its\u00a0 debts\u00a0 and obligations discharged, then one-half of the net proceeds shall be considered as the exclusive property\u00a0 of the deceased spouse.\"<\/blockquote>By the provisions of the new\u00a0 Code of Civil Procedure, in the settlement of the estates of deceased persons, it is necessary to appoint commissioners, before whom the creditors of the deceased must present their claims, within a time\u00a0 fixed by the court.<br\/><br\/>The husband is the administrator of the conjugal partnership (art. 1412, Civil Code).\u00a0 Debts contracted during this administration by the husband are payable out of the conjugal partnership property\u00a0 (art.\u00a0 1422,\u00a0 Civil Code).\u00a0 The amount of the conjugal property to\u00a0 be distributed can not, therefore, be determined until after the debts are paid.\u00a0 The surviving spouse can not claim one-half of the conjugal property until\u00a0 after the\u00a0 liquidation of\u00a0 the debts.\u00a0\u00a0 While the proportion of the participation\u00a0 of the surviving spouse in the conjugal property is fixed by law, the amount can not be determined until after the debts are paid.<br\/><br\/>It is true, under the provisions of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions, that the heirs, if adults, may agree\u00a0 upon a division\u00a0 of the estate (sec. 596, Code of Procedure)\u00a0 by assuming the payment of the\u00a0 debts, if any, against the estate.\u00a0\u00a0 Until it\u00a0 appears that\u00a0 the\u00a0 heirs have by mutual agreement among themselves agreed to a\u00a0 division of the estate,\u00a0 assuming thereby the obligation to pay the debts, the wife, no more than any of\u00a0 the other\u00a0 heirs, has a right to\u00a0 sue\u00a0 for her\u00a0 participation\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 conjugal\u00a0 property. Unless the adult heirs agree to a division of the\u00a0 inheritance,\u00a0 the estate must be administered\u00a0 in accordance with law, by the appointment of an administrator,\u00a0 and by\u00a0 the appointment of commissioners\u00a0 to hear claims against\u00a0 the estate.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the lower court is therefore declared to be of\u00a0 no effect and the cause\u00a0 is\u00a0 hereby remanded to\u00a0 the lower\u00a0 court with direction that such steps be taken as may be\u00a0 necessary for the proper division or\u00a0 administration of the estate of Paulino Rendon.<br\/><br\/>Without any finding as to costs, it is so\u00a0 ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Arcadio Paguia, as administrator of the estates of Antonio de Roxas and Rafaela Paguia,\u00a0 claimed\u00a0 that 3 hectares of the first parcel belonged to\u00a0 the heirs of\u00a0 said Antonio de Roxas, deceased.\u00a0\u00a0 It appears that the lands mentioned in the petition contain something over 80 hectares more, than the total of all the lands described in the documents of title introduced in evidence by the petitioner.\u00a0\u00a0 The court below, after\u00a0 a careful consideration of the evidence relating to the quantity of\u00a0 land\u00a0 owned\u00a0 by the petitioner,\u00a0 arrived at thte conclusion that the petitioner had included in the lands described in his petition, and\u00a0 also in the plan filed by him therewith,\u00a0 several\u00a0 parcels of land not described in\u00a0 his muniments of title and that the\u00a0 proofs did not justify him\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 in claiming this excess.\u00a0 The court below accordingly dismissed the petition as to that portion of the lands described therein in excess\u00a0 of the amount\u00a0 of land described in the documents of title.\u00a0 From this portion of\u00a0 the decision of the court below the petitioner did not appeal.<br\/><br\/>The main question in this case arises from the opposition of Manuel Rodriguez and others with reference to that portion of the first parcel of land above-mentioned obtained by the petitioner by purchase from Emigdio Navarro.\u00a0 As before stated, the\u00a0 oppositors found their objection to the registration of the land in question in the claim that Emigdio Navarro had\u00a0 sold\u00a0 said land to the father of the oppositors,\u00a0 Antonio\u00a0 Rodriguez, on\u00a0 the 23d day of October, 1894,\u00a0 It appears, however,\u00a0 from Exhibit\u00a0 U, introduced in evidence by\u00a0 the petitioner, that the said Antonio Rodriguez, as civil governor of the Province of Tarlac, on the 12th\u00a0 day of November, 1894, transferred said land to said Emigdio Navarro,\u00a0 which said transfer was the last step necessary to complete the purchase of said land by said Navarro at a public sale which took place in 1889.\u00a0 It appears clearly\u00a0 established from the proofs that from the time\u00a0 of\u00a0 said transfer, namely, November\u00a0 12, 1894, said Navarro\u00a0 continuously\u00a0 possessed\u00a0 the\u00a0 land\u00a0\u00a0 thus\u00a0 obtained down to the time\u00a0 when he sold it to the petitioner in this case.\u00a0\u00a0 At the time of\u00a0 the\u00a0 sale to the petitioner the said Navarro was not only in possession of said land but also in possession of Exhibit U and of the old documents of title, Exhibits\u00a0 V, W, and X, relating\u00a0 to the land\u00a0 in question. There is\u00a0 no\u00a0 proof in the case tending to\u00a0 show\u00a0 that the petitioner herein had any knowledge whatever of any claim laid to said lands on the part of the oppositors or had any knowledge that\u00a0 Rodriguez claimed to have\u00a0 been\u00a0 the purchaser of said lands,\u00a0 The court below well\u00a0 says:<br\/><blockquote>\"That it does not appear anywhere\u00a0 in the case that the petitioner knew of\u00a0 the\u00a0 pretensions to said lands on the part of said oppositors or that the petitioner did not buy the lands\u00a0 of Navarro in good faith. Good faith is always presumed (article\u00a0 34 of the Civil Code), and after leaving Emigdio Navarro\u00a0 in\u00a0 possession\u00a0 of the said land and the document Exhibit\u00a0 U for a period of twelve years prior to the sale to\u00a0 the\u00a0 petitioner,\u00a0 the\u00a0 oppositors\u00a0 may\u00a0 not now maintain as against the petitioner the pretended acquisition of the title to said lands by their father from Navarro a month before the execution of Exhibit U.\u00a0 The opposition of Manuel Rodriguez and others is overruled.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>After a careful examination of the record and the proofs, we find ourselves fully in accord with the conclusions of the court below.\u00a0 Even conceding that\u00a0 said Emigdio Navarro was the\u00a0 real owner of the lands in question on the 23d day of October, 1894, and that on that\u00a0 date he\u00a0 executed and delivered a private document of\u00a0 sale to the said Manuel Rodriguez of the\u00a0 lands\u00a0 in\u00a0 question, it\u00a0 is,\u00a0 nevertheless,\u00a0 a fact that in the year 1906 he executed and delivered\u00a0 a public document of sale of the same land to the petitioner, Jose\u00a0 Cojuangco,\u00a0 who took said\u00a0 land\u00a0 in\u00a0 good faith and without knowledge\u00a0 of said private document and while said land was in the possession of his\u00a0 vendor.\u00a0 Article 1473 of the Civil Code reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Art.\u00a0 1473. If the same\u00a0 thing should have been sold to different vendees, the ownership shall be transferred to the person who may have first taken possession thereof in good faith, if\u00a0 it should be personal property.<br\/><br\/>\"Should it be real property, it shall belong to the person acquiring it who first recorded it in the registry.<br\/><br\/>\"Should there be no entry, the\u00a0 property shall belong to the person who first took possession of it in good faith, and, in the absence thereof,\u00a0 to the\u00a0 person who\u00a0 presents the oldest title, provided there is good faith.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It is undisputed\u00a0 that\u00a0 neither document was registered and that the petitioner in this case first took possession of the land\u00a0 in question in good faith.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of\u00a0 the court below is hereby affirmed, with costs against the appellants.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

On\u00a0 or about the\u00a0 28th day of January he discovered that he would have no use\u00a0 for said steamer for some weeks.\u00a0 He therefore called upon the defendants, Armstrong &amp; Mackay, brokers, and requested them to find a subcharterer for said steamer in the Saigon-Manila rice trade.\u00a0 After some effort the defendants were unable to\u00a0 secure a subcharterer, as requested, and reported the fact to the plaintiff.\u00a0 The plaintiff then suggested\u00a0 that the defendants make\u00a0 an effort to find a subcharterer\u00a0 for said steamer in Hongkong.\u00a0 After some negotiations with George Grimble (the agent of the defendants in Hongkong) two\u00a0 charter contracts\u00a0 were entered into\u00a0 for the Hongkong-Saigon trade, for the use of said steamer<i> Solstad<\/i>. These\u00a0 contracts (Exhibits C\u00a0 and\u00a0 D) were duly signed by the\u00a0 subcharterers in\u00a0 Hongkong and by\u00a0 the said George Grimble, representing the defendants. These contracts\u00a0 (Exhibits C and D)\u00a0 were finally sent to Manila.\u00a0 They were dated, respectively, the 6th\u00a0 and 10th days of February, 1908.\u00a0\u00a0 Later the defendants entered into two contracts\u00a0 (Exhibits A and B)\u00a0 with the plaintiff.\u00a0 The contracts A and B\u00a0 were dated, respectively, the\u00a0 12th and 15th days\u00a0 of February, 1908.\u00a0\u00a0 The record does not disclose just why the contracts,\u00a0 Exhibits A and B, were executed and delivered\u00a0 after the contracts C and D had been executed and delivered.\u00a0 The provisions of the contracts C and D and A and B are in general terms the same.\u00a0 Paragraphs 16 and 17 of Exhibit C are as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"16.

English of rice,\u00a0 etc.,\u00a0 is\u00a0 <i>16 cents<\/i> instead of <i>14 cents<\/i> as mentioned in said paragraph 16 of Exhibit C.<br\/><br\/>Paragraphs 13 and 14 of Exhibit\u00a0 A are as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"13.

Paragraph 17 is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"17. If\u00a0 a mixed cargo be shipped, freight\u00a0 to be paid at the above rate (14\u00a0 cts.\u00a0 and in Exhibit D,\u00a0 16 cts.) on the estimated capacity of the vessel, say on thirty thousand piculs at 14 cts. per picul.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>So far as this paragraph of the respective contracts C and D and A and B is concerned, the rights and obligations of the parties are the same\u00a0 whether the action be brought upon one or the other of the contracts.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff claims that by reason of the fact that the charterers under contracts C and D carried rice, broken rice, rice flour, and paddy that the cargo was a mixed cargo and that he was entitled to recover 14 cents in one case and 16 cents in the other upon the estimated capacity of the vessel, or for 30,000 piculs.\u00a0 If this contention of the plaintiff is correct, then he should have recovered, under contract C (or A);\u00a0 the sum of P4,200 and under contract D (or B) the sum of P4,800.<br\/><br\/>The real question, therefore, presented in the record, without reference\u00a0 to the special assignments of error made\u00a0 by the appellant, is whether or not the cargo, composed of rice, broken rice, rice flour, and paddy, is a mixed cargo.\u00a0 If it is, then\u00a0 under either\u00a0 of\u00a0 the contracts\u00a0 the subcharterers are obliged to pay at the rate of 14 and\u00a0 16 cents, respectively, on the full estimated capacity of the vessel.\u00a0\u00a0 It is admitted that the plaintiff has received the full amount due under the said contracts, based\u00a0 upon the rate of 14\u00a0 and 16 cents, respectively, for the actual freight carried, composed of rice, broken rice, etc.\u00a0\u00a0 The amount actually received by the plaintiff,\u00a0 as shown by said Exhibits E and F, was the sum of 7,371.88 pesos, Hongkong money, while the plaintiff claims that he should have received the sum of 9,000 pesos, Hongkong money, under said contract, for the reason that the cargo was a mixed cargo.<br\/><br\/>By comparing paragraph 16 of contracts C\u00a0 and D\u00a0 with paragraph 13 of contracts A and B, it will be seen that the following provision of contracts C and D was not included in paragraph 13 of contracts A and B:<br\/><blockquote>\"(25%)\u00a0 twenty-five per cent additional freight for every picul of 133 1\/3\u00a0 lbs. English of paddy and or rice flour No. 1 and or broken rice No. 2 and (50%) fifty per cent additional freight for every\u00a0 picul of 133\u00a3 lbs.\u00a0 English of rice flour No. 2 and or cargo broken rice No. 3, net weight delivered.\"<\/blockquote>The defendants contend that the addition of broken\u00a0 rice, rice flour, and paddy to the cargo of\u00a0 rice did not make the cargo a mixed cargo.\u00a0 In support of this contention the defendants presented\u00a0 a decision of Sir Francis Piggott, Kt., chief justice of the colony of Hongkong (Official Law Reports, Colony of Hongkong, vol. 3, p. 86), in which the said chief justice held that - \"According to the customs of the Saigon-Hongkong trade, a cargo is not a mixed cargo, within the meaning of clause 17, unless other cargo not mentioned in\u00a0 the charter party, such as matches, piece goods, machinery, or fish, is shipped in the holds, together with rice, paddy, and flour.\"<br\/><br\/>It will be remembered that the contracts in question\u00a0 were made with reference to the Saigon-Hongkong trade.\u00a0 The custom,\u00a0 therefore, of that trade should govern in the interpretation of the contracts in question.\u00a0 It is the duty of the courts, so\u00a0 far as is possible in compliance with the express provisions of law,\u00a0 to adopt that interpretation given to contracts by the merchants themselves by actual practice.<br\/><br\/>Following\u00a0 the interpretation given to contracts such as the one in question by the courts and the merchants in the Saigon-Hongkong\u00a0 trade, and\u00a0 <i>without attempting\u00a0 to define what is a mixed cargo generally,<\/i> we are\u00a0 of the opinion and so\u00a0 hold\u00a0 that\u00a0 the\u00a0 decision\u00a0 of\u00a0 the lower court should\u00a0 be reversed, and the defendants are hereby\u00a0 absolved from any liability under said complaint.<br\/><br\/>Without any finding as to costs, it is so ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.\u00a0 J., Torres <\/i>and <i>Trent, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><br\/><br\/><hr align=\"center\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><br\/><center><br\/><i>CONCURRING<\/i><br\/><\/center> <br\/><br\/><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">MORELAND, <\/span><i style=\"font-weight: bold;\">J,,<\/i><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"> \u00a0<\/span><br\/><br\/>I concur in the result.\u00a0 The basis of my conclusion is\u00a0 that the instrument presented\u00a0 in evidence as\u00a0 the contract upon which this\u00a0 action is brought was never, in effect, a contract between the parties,\u00a0 and especially not for the purposes set forth in the complaint and proofs.<br\/><\/div>",

LIM SAN, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/>\n<br\/>\nD E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>MORELAND, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">The defendant in this case was convicted of the crime of attempted murder in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila and sentenced to seven years of <i>presidio mayor<\/i> and to pay one-third of the costs of the trial.<br\/><br\/>It is alleged that on or about the 18th day of October, 1908, the defendant Lim San attempted to kill one Keng Kin by assaulting him with a bolo and inflicting upon him several wounds; that one of the wounds would have proved fatal had not the injured person received prompt and efficient medical assistance.<br\/><br\/>The guilt of the defendant was established beyond reasonable doubt,\" if the testimony of Keng Kin, Chua Hung, and Gregorio Mariano is to be believed. All of these witnesses testify that the accused assaulted Keng Kin without cause or provocation and stabbed him several times with a bolo. All unite in saying that Keng Kin, at the time, was standing just outside the limits of the street, his attention upon a dog which he had with him, when the accused leaped upon him with his bolo and committed the acts complained of. All of these witnesses saw the accused in the act, fully recognized him, and later identified him as the person who committed the offense.<br\/><br\/>The defense interposed by the accused was an alibi. He produced several witnesses to support it. Between the testimony of these witnesses and that of the witnesses of the prosecution there is an irreconcilable contradiction. The court below, having heard the witnesses testify and having observed their manner and attitude upon the witness stand, decided that credibility lay with those of the prosecution. A careful reading of the testimony discloses no reason why the conclusion of the court in this particular should be disturbed. The court decided between witness and witness. There are no conditions found in the record which render the story told by the witnesses for the prosecution inherently improbable. There is no circumstance disclosed which impeaches their truthfulness. There is nothing found which impugns in any way their credibility. Under such conditions we will not interfere with the conclusion of the trial court respecting credibility.<br\/><br\/>The crime in this case was committed about 10 o'clock at night. It was somewhat dark, the only light being that given by a lamp suspended from the ceiling of a <i>tienda<\/i> directly across the street. Keng Kin was not expecting to be attacked. His attention was directed exclusively to his dog.\u00a0\u00a0 He was wholly unsuspicious.\u00a0\u00a0 Every faculty was withdrawn from consideration of danger. The accused, without warning of any kind, careful not to disturb the quiescent attitude in which he found his victim until the very instant of the blow, attacked him with great rapidity and force, driving his bolo straight into his face. On the first blow the point of the knife entered the left eye, penetrating to and slightly cutting the brain, destroying the eye completely and rendering him entirely incapable of protecting himself. As a necessary result, the assaulted had no opportunity whatever to defend himself, to escape the blow, to ward it off, or to mitigate its consequences. He was wholly surprised and incapable of offering the slightest resistance. This means simply that the accused committed the crime maliciously and treacherously by methods which tended, directly and especially, to insure him against risk that might proceed from any defense which his victim might make. In other words, the combination of the conditions, darkness, distracted attention, lack of. knowledge of the attack, lack of warning, the suddenness of the assault, the maneuvering of the accused in such way as not to attract attention till the very moment of the blow, keeping him quiescent until the end was accomplished, constitutes alevosia under subdivision 2 of article 10 of the Penal Code. This would have made the crime murder had Keng Kin been killed.<br\/><br\/>The court found the defendant guilty of the crime of attempted murder. We are unable to agree with that finding. We regard the crime as frustrated murder. The distinction between frustrated murder and attempted murder is this: In frustrated murder the accused performs all of the acts which he believes necessary to consummate the crime. Death, however, fails to follow for causes entirely apart from his will. In attempted murder the accused begins the commission of the crime by overt acts, but involuntarily desists from performing the other acts necessary to consummate the crime, he being prevented from so doing by some cause outside of his own will.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the case at bar it appears clearly that the defendant believed that he had performed all of the acts necessary to consummate the crime of murder, and, therefore, of his own will, desisted from striking further blows. He believed that he had killed Keng Kin. Death did not result for reasons entirely apart from the will of the accused. This surely stamps the crime as frustrated murder. If, after the first blow, some one had rushed to the assistance of Keng Kin and by his efforts had prevented the accused from proceeding further in the commission of the crime, the accused not believing that he had performed all of the acts necessary to cause death, he would have been guilty of attempted murder.<br\/><br\/>The information in this case reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Pursuant to a preliminary investigation heretofore conducted in the office of the prosecuting attorney for the city of Manila, under the provisions of section 39 of Act No. 183 of the United States Philippine Commission, as amended, the undersigned, prosecuting attorney of the city of Manila, gives the court information against Lim San, Lim Chu, and Que Lat, and accuses the same, and each of them, of the crime of attempted assassination, committed as follows:<br\/><br\/>\"That on or about the 18th day of October, 1908, in the city of Manila, Philippine Islands, the said Lim San, Lim Chu, and Que Lat, conspiring together, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, feloniously, with treachery, deliberate and known premeditation, and in the nighttime, attempt to kill and assassinate one Keng Kin, by then and there, in the nighttime, lying in wait for and assaulting, cutting, and stabbing the said Keng Kin with deadly weapons - to wit, large bolos - and inflicting then and there upon the head and body of the said Keng Kin numerous cuts, wounds, and physical injuries, with intent then and there to kill and assassinate the said Keng Kin; that the said accused then and there performed all of the acts of execution which should constitute the crime of assassination, but which did not constitute said crime by reason of the fact that though said wounds were intended by the said accused to cause the death of the said Keng Kin, and were believed by the said accused to be sufficient to cause the death of the said Keng Kin, did not cause his death, by reason of prompt and efficient medical assistance, which prevented the said wounds from becoming fatal.<br\/><br\/>\"All contrary to law.\"<\/blockquote>It appears from this pleading that the prosecuting attorney characterized the crime in the caption of the information as <i>attempted<\/i> assassination. It appears, however, that the facts set out in the body of the information describe the crime of <i>frustrated <\/i>assassination. Notwithstanding apparent contradiction between caption and body, we believe that we ought to say and hold that the characterization of the crime by the fiscal in the caption of the information is immaterial and purposeless, and that the facts stated in the body of the pleading must determine the crime of which the defendant stands charged and for which he must be tried. The establishment of this doctrine is permitted by the Code of Criminal Procedure, and is thoroughly in accord with common sense and with the requirements of plain justice. We are aware that such a doctrine departs somewhat from the established theories of American criminal jurisprudence; but we are confident that the result obtained fully justifies our holding. Many cases might be cited in which justice has either been greatly delayed or wholly defeated by adhering to the doctrine which we discard. Procedure in criminal actions should always be so framed as to insure to each criminal that retributive punishment which ought swiftly and surely to visit him who willfully and maliciously violates the penal laws of society. We believe that a doctrine which does not produce such a result is illogical and unsound and works irreparable injury to the community in which it prevails.<br\/><br\/>From a legal point of view, and in a very real sense, it is of no concern to the accused what is the technical name of the crime of which he stands charged.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It in no way aids him in a defense on the merits. Whatever its purpose may be, its result is to enable the accused to vex the court and embarrass the administration of justice by setting up the technical defense that the crime set forth in the body of the information and proved in the trial is not the crime characterized by the fiscal in the caption of the information. That to which his attention should be directed, and in which he, above all things else, should be most interested, are the facts alleged. The real question is not did he commit a crime given in the law some technical and specific name, but did he perform the acts alleged in the body of the information in the manner therein set forth. If he did, it is of no consequence to him, either as a matter of procedure or of substantive right, how the law denominates the crime which those acts constitute. The designation of the crime by name in the caption of the information from the facts alleged in the body of that pleading is a conclusion of law made by the fiscal. In the designation of the crime the accused never has a real interest until the trial has ended. For his full and complete defense he need not know the name of the crime at all. It is of no consequence whatever for the protection of his substantial rights. The real and important question to him is, \"Did you perform the acts alleged in the manner alleged?\" not, \"Did you commit a crime named murder?\" If he performed the acts alleged, in the manner stated, the Jaw determines what the name of the crime is and fixes the penalty therefor. It is the province of the court alone to say what the crime is or what it is named. If the accused performed the acts alleged in the manner alleged, then he ought to be punished and punished adequately, whatever may be the name of the crime which those acts constitute.<br\/><br\/>The plea of not guilty ought always to raise a question of fact and not of law. The characterization of the crime is a conclusion of law on the part of the fiscal. The denial by the accused that he committed that specific crime so characterized raises no real question.\u00a0\u00a0 No issue can be raised by the assertion of a conclusion of law by one party and a denial of such conclusion by the other. The issues raised by the pleadings in criminal actions, as well as in civil, are primarily and really issues of fact and not of law. The issue to be tried in all criminal cases should be one of fact, raised by the allegation of certain facts in the information and a denial of those facts by the plea of not guilty on the part of the defendant. There is no more reason why the defendant should be allowed to take advantage of a misnomer of the action where the people are prosecuting than when assailed civilly by a private individual.<br\/><br\/>The failure to observe this fundamental distinction has been one of the causes of the frequent miscarriage of justice in criminal cases in many parts of the United States. If a plaintiff in a civil action should open his complaint with the statement, \"This is an action of tort,\" and then proceed to set out fully facts showing that his action was really to foreclose a mortage, asking the remedy proper to that end, no court would hesitate a moment as to what was the real nature of the action. It could not be contended for an instant that the plaintiff, in order to recover, would be obliged to prove an action in tort. The statement, \"This is an action in tort,\" is a mere conclusion of law and not a statement of fact. It has no influence whatever upon the nature of the action. It is pure surplusage. It can not fairly be said to deceive the defendant. So far as the procedure or the merits are concerned, it is of no consequence what the name of the action may be. Issues are not made by asserting and denying names. They are framed by the allegation and denial of facts. The acts or omissions of the defendant, as set out by the plaintiff in the complaint as the basis of his action, are that to which the defendant looks to prepare his defense. They are that to which, when proved, the court looks to apply the remedy.<br\/><br\/>So it is with pleadings in criminal actions. To quibble about names is to lose sight of realities. To permit an accused to stand by and watch the fiscal while he guesses as to the name which ought to be applied to the crime of which he charges the accused, and then take adventage of the guess if it happens to be wrong, while the acts or omissions upon which that guess was made and which are the real and only foundation of the charge against him are clearly and fully stated in the information, is to change the battle ground in criminal cases from issues to guesses and from fact to fancy. It changes lawyers into dialecticians and law into metaphysics - that fertile field of delusion propagated by language.<br\/><br\/>Section 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"An information is an accusation in writing charging a person with a public offense, presented and signed by the promotor fiscal or his deputy and filed with the clerk of the court.\"<\/blockquote>Section 6 is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"A complaint or information is sufficient if it shows:<br\/><br\/>\"1. The name of the defendant, or, if his name can not be discovered, that he is described under a fictitious name with a statement that his true name is unknown to the informant or official signing the same. His true name may be inserted at any stage of the proceedings instituted against him, whenever ascertained.<br\/><br\/>\"2. The designation of the crime or public offense charged.<br\/><br\/>\"3. The acts or omission complained of as constituting the crime or public offense in ordinary and concise language, without repetition, not necessarily in the, words of the statute, but in such form as to enable a person of common understanding to know what is intended and the court to pronounce judgment according to right.<br\/><br\/>\"4. That the offense was committed within the jurisdiction of the court and is triable therein.<br\/><br\/>\"5. The names of the persons against whom, or against whose property, the offense was committed, if known.\" Section 8 reads as follows:<br\/><br\/>\"A complaint or information may be substantially in the following form:<br\/><br\/>\" The United States against A. B.<br\/><br\/>\" In the Court of. ............................... for ............................, Province of ............................................, the ......................... day of ................................................, 19......<br\/><br\/>\" 'A. B. is accused by the undersigned of the crime of (giving its legal appellation, such as murder, arson, robbery, or the like, or designating it as a felony or misdemeanor), committed as follows:<br\/><br\/>\" 'That said A, B., on the............day of............................, 19......, at the............of............, Province of.........................., (here set forth the acts or omissions charged as an offense), contrary to the statute in such case made and provided.<br\/><br\/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\"' (Signed) ........................................................'\"<\/blockquote>Subdivision 2, section 6, above quoted, requires that the information shall contain \"the designation of the crime or public offense charged\/' But while that is so and while section 8 provides that the information may state the legal appellation of the crime, \"such as murder, arson, robbery, or the like,\" nevertheless, said section also provides that such offense may be designated generally \"as a felony or misdemeanor.\" This evidently and unquestionably permits an information to be drawn and framed upon the lines marked in the doctrine we here lay down. This is the form in which information should be drawn.<br\/><br\/>We are aware that it may be said that, when a fiscal has characterized by name the offense with which he charges the defendant, and the defendant has accepted that characterization in good faith and prepared his trial in accordance therewith, he ought not to be required upon appeal or elsewhere to meet a new or different crime; that such a proceeding would prejudice him severely and might be the means of convicting him without a real hearing, if not without due process of law. Our reply is, in the first place, that it is very rare indeed that circumstances would be presented in which an accused could by any change be thus prejudiced. Such contingency is so remote as to be almost negligible. But, should such a condition arise, we say, in the second place, that this court will not permit the doctrine here laid down to prejudice any defendant who has been innocently misled in any action heretofore tried. However, after the lapse of a reasonable time following the publication of this decision, its contents and tenor will be presumed to be known to all. After the doctrine here promulgated is fully known, no one will be heard to say that he has been prejudiced by its application. We reply, in the third place, that the people of the land are interested more than any single individual in the punishment of those who offend against its laws; that the fiscal has no right to characterize a crime in defiance of the interests of society; that he has no authority to speak for the State and say what crime has been committed. That is the duty of the courts - the duty of a coordinate branch of the government, one of its three departments - to which and to which alone the sovereignty has delegated the right to denominate crime from facts alleged or proved and to impose punishment in accordance with that denomination. The duty of the fiscal in framing an information is limited to a statement of the facts which the accused has performed and the manner in which he performed them. It is no part of his duties to give a technical name to the crime which is born of the facts set forth, or draw an inference or conclusion as to how the courts will or will not denominate the crime described by the facts. If the fiscal denominate or characterize the crime and if that denomination binds the court, as it always does under the doctrine we are criticizing, then it is clear that the fiscal has, by such act, usurped the function of the court, inasmuch as he has thereby irrevocably decided by his own fiat of what crime, if any, the defendant shall be convicted. This is not only performing duties ministerial, but legislative and judicial as well. He thus not only tries the case as fiscal, but he also, by his mischaracterization, changes the law really applicable to the case.\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, such mischaracterization being binding on the courts, he also thereby in a sense adjudicates the offense for which the defendant shall be punished. He thus leaves little for the court to do but apply the penalty. Even that must be in accordance with the n\"seal's characterization. We would say, fourthly, that a careful lawyer ought always to prepare the defense of his client to meet every allegation of material fact presented by the people's pleading, and to deny, and to substantiate that denial by proof, every such fact which is alleged and proved to his prejudice, and that wholly irrespective of the characterization of the crime by the fiscal. It is undoubted that every innocent man can and will do that. No innocent man will permit himself to rest under proof that he has been guilty of a malicious and criminal act against the law of the land. He desires above all things to disprove, and will always insist upon disproving, everything presented by the prosecution which smirches his character or taints his honor. Generally speaking, it is only the criminal, either by act or intention, who is willing to rest his defense upon the technicality of a characterization, leaving the main facts proved against him untouched and the conclusions from them unrebuked. Every innocent man wants to meet facts and not theories. He wants to strike at the substance of fact and not the straw man of conclusion. He will insist on meeting the thing and not the characterization of the thing.<br\/><br\/>Moreover, one can not claim to be prejudiced who voluntarily and willfully shuts his eyes to the facts alleged. Why are the facts alleged at all if not to specify the real nature of the crime? If the accused looks to the characterization of the fiscal and not to the facts, why have facts at all; why not have the information state conclusions only? But it will be observed that if we should urge that proposition, the accused would be he who would first object. His instant reply would be, \"I want facts and not conclusions. I can prepare no defense against the allegation of mere conclusions.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nevertheless he insists on holding the people strictly to the pure conclusion involved in the fiscal's characterization of the crime. In other words, he wants conclusions if the facts hurt him, and he warita facts if the conclusions hurt him. A technicality is something which makes a criminal life worth living. This is here fully exemplified.<br\/><br\/>We are not forgetful, in what we have said, of those sacred and immutable rights which belong to every freeman. We do not forget, either, that institutions and states which do not sacredly protect and guard those rights can not live. To their protection every man is willing to dedicate his life, his fortune, and his honor. The doctrine here laid down conserves those rights swiftly and perfectly\u00a0 far more so than does the doctrine we are criticizing. On the other hand and in addition, it protects society from the malicious activities of those who are ever ready to commit crime if there exists in the law anywhere a technicality upon which they may rest a hope of escape.<br\/><br\/>For these reasons it is competent for this court to find the defendant guilty of the crime described by the facts stated in the information, these facts being fully and satisfactorily proved and the accused having in no wise been prejudiced.<br\/><br\/>Under article 407 of the Penal Code the defendant should be punished with a penalty lower by one degree than that which would have been applied had he consummated the crime. The penalty for the consummated crime ranges from <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">cadena temporal<\/span> in its maximum degree to death. The penalty lower by one degree is from<i> presidio correccional <\/i>in its maximum degree to <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">presidio mayor <\/span>in its medium degree. There being present the aggravating circumstance of nocturnity, the penalty must be imposed in it's maximum degree.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below is, therefore, reversed, and the defendant is convicted of the crime of frustrated murder and sentenced to eight years and one day of <i>presidio mayor<\/i> and to pay one-third of the costs, There being no evidence in the case of the damages which Keng Kin has suffered by reason of the acts complained of, no indemnity can be required paid in this action.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson,<\/i> and <i>Trent, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><\/div>",

C. Milliron, an agent of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, after taking a memorandum of the numbers of certain bank notes to\u00a0 the value of P35, to wit, two 10-peso and three 5-peso notes, delivered them, together with 1 peso in silver, to Pacencio Rosales, an employee of the said Bureau,\u00a0 in\u00a0 order that the latter might therewith\u00a0 procure opium, and\u00a0 accordingly\u00a0 Rosales, after he likewise had made a memorandum of the numbers of the said notes, on the 25th of the month aforementioned, delivered the said amount to the Chinaman Go Chico, telling him to buy opium wherever he might find\u00a0 it.\u00a0\u00a0 As\u00a0 soon as Go\u00a0 Chico\u00a0 had received the money, he went to the store of the Chinaman Sy Maco, and there having informed the Chinaman Go Quico, a clerk in the employ\u00a0 of the owner of the store, of the object of his visit, the latter immediately sold him some opium contained in a can which the said clerk fetched from the back part of the store\u00a0 and delivered to\u00a0 him in the presence of the said Sy Maco, before whom Go Chico paid the price of the opium acquired by delivering the\u00a0 said amount of money.\u00a0 During this transaction\u00a0 Sy Maco told the buyer, Go Chico, before the latter left the store,\u00a0 that he should be very cautious, as the opium was very dangerous on account of its being contraband.\u00a0\u00a0 Another Chinaman, named Du Ho\u00a0 Hay, who had entered the\u00a0 store after Go Chico to demand a certain sum of money\u00a0 which he had delivered\u00a0 the day before to the said Go Quico, as the latter had not furnished him the opium he desired to purchase, was also present at the time.<br\/><br\/>While Go Chico was buying the opium, Pacencio Rosales stationed\u00a0 himself in the street to observe, from a certain distance away, what was going on in the store.\u00a0\u00a0 After the buyer came out of\u00a0 it, he and Rosales went to the latter's house in order there to\u00a0 ascertain whether the contents oi the can received in\u00a0 Sy Maco's store was really opium, and afterwards Rosales went to the agent Milliron to deliver the can to him.\u00a0\u00a0 The latter, through a hole that had been opened in the can, examined its contents and, as soon as he was convinced that it really\u00a0 contained opium, at once\u00a0 proceeded to make a search of the\u00a0 said Sy Maco's store, which lasted from 11 o'clock in the morning until 1 o'clock in the afternoon, approximately.\u00a0 At\u00a0 the commencement of the search, the agent Milliron seized two 10-peso bank notes and one of 5 pesos, found in one of the drawers of the\u00a0 store, as they bore exactly,\u00a0 the numbers\u00a0 of which\u00a0 he had made a memorandum before he had delivered the notes to Rosales.\u00a0\u00a0 Having, with difficulty, searched all the receptacles and\u00a0 depositories of the store, and notwithstanding that the adjoining room\u00a0 in the back part of it had several doors communicating with different houses, which made all search and inspection fruitless, yet Milliron found 28 pieces of bamboo and clay, such as serve to join the stem of the opium pipe with the bowl on one end and the mouthpiece on the other.' These utensils were found on some sacks and cases in\u00a0 the storeroom.\u00a0 It was observed that two of the said instruments had been used for smoking opium,\u00a0 as\u00a0 particles of\u00a0 opium were found adhering to them.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons the provincial fiscal filed an amended complaint in the Court of First Instance of Cebu, on August 27, 1909, charging the Chinamen Go Quico and Sy Maco with a violation of section 15 of Act No. 1761, and as this case\u00a0 was instituted solely\u00a0 against Sy\u00a0 Maco, under his\u00a0 petition that he\u00a0 be tried separately\u00a0 from his coaccused,\u00a0 Go Quico, the\u00a0 court, after considering the\u00a0 evidence\u00a0 adduced therein, rendered judgment on\u00a0 September 29 of the same year\u00a0 (p.\u00a0 59 of the trial\u00a0 record), and sentenced the defendant Sy\u00a0 Maco to pay a fine of P2,000 and,\u00a0 in\u00a0 case of insolvency, to subsidiary imprisonment, and to the payment of\u00a0 one-half of\u00a0 the costs.\u00a0 The can of opium and the instruments\u00a0 for smoking the drug, which had been seized,\u00a0 were also ordered to be confiscated.\u00a0\u00a0 From this judgment the defendant,\u00a0 Sy Maco, appealed.<br\/><br\/>Section i5 of\u00a0 Act No. 1761, known as The Opium Law, provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"(<i>a<\/i>)\u00a0 No\u00a0 person\u00a0 shall import,\u00a0 cook, or\u00a0 prepare opium, or engage in the business of purchasing or selling opium or of dealing or trafficking therein, unless he\u00a0 shall\u00a0 first have secured from\u00a0 the Collector of Internal Revenue a license to transact such business and shall\u00a0 have paid the license tax prescribed by this Act.\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>\"<i>(b<\/i>) Any person violating the provisions of this section shall be punished by a fine of not less than\u00a0 five hundred pesos nor more than two thousand pesos, or by\u00a0 imprisonment for a period\u00a0 of not more than one\u00a0 year, or by both such fine and imprisonment, in the discretion of the court.\"<\/blockquote>From the evidence adduced at\u00a0 the trial\u00a0 of this case it was proved that the sale of\u00a0 a certain quantity of opium, in the store belonging to the Chinaman Sy Maco, by the latter's clerk, named Go\u00a0 Quico, to the Chinaman Go Chico, the buyer of the drug, took place in the\u00a0 presence of the said Sy Maco, for the latter, at the moment that the buyer was on the\u00a0 point of going out of the store with the opium he had bought,\u00a0 charged\u00a0 the said\u00a0 Go Chico to be\u00a0 cautious because the said drug was\u00a0 contraband\u00a0 and was very dangerous.\u00a0 The record does not show it to have been proved that the opium sold belonged exclusively to Go Quico, while it does show that the clerk\u00a0 got the article from the inner part of the\u00a0 store, and that the bank\u00a0 notes\u00a0 delivered by the buyer in payment of\u00a0 the price of the opium were found in a drawer in common\u00a0 use in the said store.\u00a0\u00a0 Wherefore it is unquestionable that the defendant Sy Maco was directly interested in the sale and\u00a0 traffic\u00a0 of the\u00a0 said\u00a0 drug,\u00a0 and in whose store, at any rate,\u00a0 the opium sold was kept, aside from the\u00a0 fact that a number of instruments for\u00a0 smoking opium, two\u00a0 of which\u00a0 bore\u00a0 evident\u00a0 signs\u00a0 of having been used, were found inside the said store.\u00a0\u00a0 For these reasons the liability\u00a0 of the\u00a0 defendant is\u00a0 undeniable, as he had in his store opium\u00a0 intended for sale and knowingly permitted the sale, in\u00a0 his presence, of a certain quantity of\u00a0 the said drug by his\u00a0 clerk, Go Quico.<br\/><br\/>With respect\u00a0 to the errors assigned by\u00a0 the\u00a0 defense to the judgment appealed from, it is proper\u00a0 to state herein, for the purposes of this decision, that the Act\u00a0 of Congress of March 3, 1905, section 11, Class III, group 1, No. 80 (<i>b<\/i>), prescribes, among other things, the following:<br\/><blockquote><i>\"Provided, however,<\/i> That the Philippine\u00a0 Commission or any subsequent Philippine legislature shall have the power to enact legislation to prohibit absolutely the importation or sale of opium, or to limit\u00a0 or restrict\u00a0 its importation and sale, or adopt such other measures as may be\u00a0 required for the suppression of the evils\u00a0 resulting\u00a0 from\u00a0 the sale and\u00a0 use of\u00a0 the\u00a0 drug: And <i>provided further,<\/i>\u00a0 That after March first,\u00a0 nineteen hundred and eight,\u00a0 it shall be unlawful to import into the Philippine Islands opium, in whatever form,\u00a0 except\u00a0 by the Government,\u00a0 and for medicinal purposes only, and at no time shall it be lawful to sell opium to any native of the\u00a0 Philippine Islands except for medicinal purposes.\"<\/blockquote>The Philippine Commission, acting\" under\u00a0 the authority granted by the said\u00a0 Act of Congress, saw fit to enact Act No.\u00a0 1761, which went\u00a0 into\u00a0 effect on October 17,\u00a0 1907, repealing the previous Act No. 1461,\u00a0 and\u00a0 establishing rules for the\u00a0 purpose of gradually restricting and regulating the sale\u00a0 and use of\u00a0 opium during the period of time yet to elapse until\u00a0 the\u00a0 arrival of\u00a0 March\u00a0 1,\u00a0 1908,\u00a0 when\u00a0 the importation of the\u00a0 said drug into these\u00a0 Islands, as well as its\u00a0 carrying,\u00a0 holding, possession,\u00a0 or use\u00a0 for\u00a0 smoking, swallowing, injecting, and inhaling, would\u00a0 be ultimately prohibited, except for medicinal purposes, as likewise its sale, traffic\u00a0 therein,\u00a0 and so forth,\u00a0 as specified\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 Act aforementioned, enacted\u00a0 on October 10, 1907.<br\/><br\/>During the period from the 17th of the\u00a0 same month, when this Act of the\u00a0 Commission\u00a0 went into\u00a0 effect, to the day preceding that of March 1,1908, the legislature intended gradually to restrict\u00a0 and\u00a0 regulate the sale and use of opium, until its\u00a0 importation, use,\u00a0 possession,\u00a0 sale,\u00a0 and\u00a0 handling should be prohibited from and after the said 1st of March, in conformity with\u00a0 the\u00a0 aforementioned Act\u00a0 of Congress. As the Act of\u00a0 the\u00a0 Commission, before referred\u00a0 to, contains\u00a0 provisions\u00a0 applicable to the case at bar, after the absolute prohibition\u00a0 of the\u00a0 use, possession, importation, and sale of the said\u00a0 drug, there can be no rational ground nor well-founded reason\u00a0 for\u00a0 averring that the said Act of the Commission was\u00a0 in force only up to March 1, 1908, for the reason that, as\u00a0 aforestated, provisions were therein prescribed which were\u00a0 to be strictly complied with after the said date of absolute prohibition, with penalties for their violation,\u00a0 as may be seen\u00a0 by the text itself of the said Act.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 words of the\u00a0 title thereof which state, <i>pending the ultimate\u00a0 prohibition\u00a0 of the importation of opium into the Philippine Islands,<\/i> should be construed to mean the interval of time up to the date set by the Act of Congress when in accordance with said Act its importation into these Islands would be ultimately prohibited.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the allegation of the unconstitutionally of the Act of the Commission, No. 1761, on account\u00a0 of its having been\u00a0 passed for two\u00a0 different purposes,\u00a0 one restrictive prior to March 1, 1908, and the\u00a0 other prohibitive after this date,\u00a0 in\u00a0 order to\u00a0 understand that the\u00a0 said Act is not subject to the defect\u00a0 thereto attributed, it must be taken into account that Act No. 1761 was passed\u00a0 pursuant to the said Act of Congress,\u00a0 and on this being done by the Philippine Commission, the provision was strictly complied with\u00a0 which is contained in\u00a0 a paragraph\u00a0 of section 5 of the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902, to wit:<br\/><blockquote>\"That no\u00a0 private or local bill which may\u00a0 be enacted into law shall embrace more\u00a0 than one subject, and that subject shall be expressed in the title of the bill.\"<\/blockquote>It is evident that the\u00a0 Act\u00a0 of the Commission relates, as expressed by its title or caption, to a single matter, which is opium, and to no other,\u00a0 and hence the\u00a0 Act,\u00a0 which\u00a0 is properly applicable to the matter it concerns for the period from the time\u00a0 of\u00a0 its\u00a0 passage,\u00a0 prior and\u00a0 subsequent to March 1, 1908,\u00a0 until it should be absolutely repealed by another Act promulgated by the legislative\u00a0 power, is in no wise unconstitutional.<br\/><br\/>For these reasons, which\u00a0 are based upon\u00a0 the\u00a0 law, and because the complaint which initiated ^his\u00a0 case is in conformity with General\u00a0 Orders, No. 58, section\u00a0 10, we uphold the ruling denying the demurrer.\u00a0 We also uphold, as proper, the\u00a0 order denying the inhibition prayed for by the defendant's\u00a0 counsel, as no support is found\u00a0 for his petition in any of the cases specified either in section 8 of the Code of Civil Procedure nor in Act No. 81.\u00a0 Moreover, if either of the defendants charged with the commission of a single crime\u00a0 is\u00a0 entitled\u00a0 to be\u00a0 tried\u00a0 separately\u00a0 from his\u00a0 codefendant, as\u00a0 was done\u00a0 in the present case on the\u00a0 petition of Sy Maco, in which cause two judgments,\u00a0 one of the 15th and the other of the 29th of\u00a0 September, 1909, were pronounced by the judge who tried the same, in conformity with the provisions established in section 33 of the said General Orders, No. 58, the aforementioned first judgment against Go\u00a0 Quico, one of\u00a0 the\u00a0 two defendants,\u00a0 can not serve the other defendant, Sy Maco, as a ground for challenging the judge who rendered it, as he was not included therein and was the defendant afterwards concerned in the second judgment ; this because, on the petition of any of the defendants, the law authorizes the rendition of a different judgment from that required to\u00a0 be rendered against\u00a0 the others, as occurred in\u00a0 the\u00a0 present case, and, in proceeding in this wise, the judge did not violate any law\u00a0 whatever nor did he execute any act contrary or prejudicial to the defendants' rights, especially in view of the fact that, as in the case of Sy Maco, the latter expressly petitioned for a separate trial.\u00a0 It is not permissible in judicial proceedings to turn against one's own acts and to avail oneself of a privilege granted by the law\u00a0 for\u00a0 the\u00a0 purpose of\u00a0 impugning judicial\u00a0 acts in accord with the provisions of the law\u00a0 and with his own petition.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the\u00a0 other errors ascribed to the judgment appealed\u00a0 from,\u00a0 it is\u00a0 sufficient, in our\u00a0 opinion, for\u00a0 their disposal to state that the findings of fact as well\u00a0 as\u00a0 those of law, contained in that judgment, are accepted, inasmuch as we find them to\u00a0 be in accordance with the law and the evidence and\u00a0 other merits of the\u00a0 case,\u00a0 although, in\u00a0 consideration of the small amount of opium sold and of\u00a0 the fact that this is the first time, as shown by the record, that the defendant has\u00a0 violated the\u00a0 Opium\u00a0 Law,\u00a0 he\u00a0 may be deemed entitled to a lesser penalty.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing\u00a0 reasons, therefore, it is our opinion that the judgment\u00a0 appealed\u00a0 from\u00a0 must be affirmed,\u00a0 with the costs of this instance;\u00a0 provided,\u00a0 however,\u00a0 that the defendant, Sy Maco, shall be sentenced to the payment only of a fine\u00a0 of P500 and, in case of insolvency,\u00a0 to\u00a0 the\u00a0 corresponding subsidiary imprisonment.\u00a0 The bank notes with which\u00a0 the opium was\u00a0 bought\u00a0 shall be\u00a0 returned\u00a0 to\u00a0 their owner, if this has not\u00a0 already been\u00a0 done.\u00a0\u00a0 This\u00a0 decision shall\u00a0 not\u00a0 bar a continuance\u00a0 of the proceedings\u00a0 in\u00a0 this cause with respect\u00a0 to the other\u00a0 defendant, Go\u00a0 Quico,\u00a0 a report\u00a0 of the status of which shall\u00a0 be made by the\u00a0 clerk of the court.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

With the penalties of provision mayor and a fine of from 625 to 6,250 pesetas, provided that a\u00a0 grave injury to a third person or the public interests has resulted from his action.<br\/><br\/>\"2. With those of <i>prision correccional<\/i> in its minimum and medium\u00a0 degrees and a fine of from 325 to 3,250 pesetas if the injury to\u00a0 the third\u00a0 person\u00a0 or to the\u00a0 public\u00a0 interests were not grave.<br\/><br\/>\"In either case there shall, furthermore, be imposed the penalty of temporary\u00a0 special\u00a0 disqualification in its\u00a0 maximum degree to perpetual special disqualification.\"<\/blockquote>Notwithstanding the denial of the defendant that he had ever been\u00a0 appointed assistant\u00a0 postmaster,\u00a0 we think\u00a0 the evidence\u00a0 strongly tends to establish that fact; but however this may be, the defendant's own admissions\u00a0 leave no room for doubt that at the\u00a0 time when he received the letter in question\u00a0 for\u00a0 registry, he was acting for,\u00a0 and instead of, the postmaster, by\u00a0 commission\u00a0 of and direction of the postmaster, and the postmaster being undoubtedly a \"public official,\"\u00a0 defendant was criminally liable for any infidelity in\u00a0 the custody of the documents and papers thus intrusted to him, as though he himself were a public official, by virtue of the general provisions of the second paragraph of article 362 of the code, which are as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"The penalties prescribed in the three preceding articles are also\u00a0 applicable to\u00a0 ecclesiastics and to individuals intrusted temporarily\u00a0 with the transmission or custody of documents or\u00a0 papers,\u00a0 by commission of the Government or of officials to whom\u00a0 they may\u00a0 have been intrusted by virtue of their office.\"<\/blockquote>The question whether\u00a0 or not the acts complained of resulted in a \"grave injury\"\u00a0 to the public interests presents more difficulty.<br\/><br\/>Viada suggests\u00a0 that for the purpose of determining the character of damages referred to\u00a0 in these articles we should look to the eighth chapter of Title XII of the code, which, treating of damages to property\u00a0 of another unlawfully and criminally caused (in cases wherein the code imposes no specific penalty\u00a0 in other provisions thereof),\u00a0 prescribes a greater or lesser penalty as\u00a0 the\u00a0 amount is\u00a0 greater\u00a0 or\u00a0 less than 6,250 pesetas. But, while this chapter might, perhaps, be\u00a0 safely\u00a0 followed in cases\u00a0 where the amount of damage is capable of monetary valuation, it furnishes no satisfactory guide in cases of damages where\u00a0 the injury is not subject of monetary valuation, since it expressly provides a single penalty, with\u00a0 wide discretionary\u00a0 limits,\u00a0 in all cases of the destruction of documents\u00a0 and papers whose\u00a0 value is\u00a0 not subject of monetary valuation.<br\/><br\/>It would be impossible to give a precise monetary value to the injury done to\u00a0 the public service by the theft of the contents of registered mail by an employee charged with its transmission.\u00a0\u00a0 Certain it is that in addition to the actual injury done to the owner of\u00a0 the contents of such mail, the doubt and uncertainty as to the safety of registered packages resulting from thefts of their contents,\u00a0 does\u00a0 amount to a very real and positive injury to the postal service and hence to the \"public interests.\"\u00a0 In the case of\u00a0 The United States <i> vs.<\/i> Marino\u00a0 (10 Phil. Rep., 652) wherein\u00a0 the defendant was charged with a\u00a0 crime similar\u00a0 to that committed by the defendant in this case,\u00a0 and it was shown that defendant had been guilty of several separate thefts from registered mail intrusted to him, we held as follows, stating\u00a0 the doctrine as laid down in the syllabus of that case:<br\/><blockquote>\"For the\u00a0 proper qualification of the gravity of the injury caused\u00a0 to third parties\u00a0 or to the\u00a0 public interests\u00a0 in consequence\u00a0 of the above-mentioned crime of infidelity in the custody and dispatch of mails intrusted to the administration of posts, it does not suffice to take into account the extent of the injury or damage inflicted respectively on each of the parties interested in the ordinary or registered letters stolen, hidden, or destroyed by the unfaithful functionary, but\u00a0 it must be further considered that the unlawful conduct of the officer affects the public interests, inasmuch as the loss of packages, and the disappearance of letters, generally cause uneasiness and a certain alarm among the interested parties, some of whom, in the case at bar, filed their complaints with the Director of Posts.\u00a0 Such deeds committed in a post-office tend to alienate the confidence of the public in a Government service\u00a0 of the greatest necessity in social life, thus causing a grave injury of far-reaching effects to the public interests. Therefore, the penalty that should be\u00a0 applied is the more severe one prescribed in\u00a0 No. 1 of article 360 of the Penal Code, according to\u00a0 the\u00a0 jurisprudence established\u00a0 by\u00a0 the supreme court of\u00a0 Spain in its decisions\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 2d of December, 1895, and the 7th of January, 1904,\u00a0 rendered on appeals in cassation,\u00a0 when applying\u00a0 the\u00a0 provisions of the corresponding article of\u00a0 the Spanish\u00a0 Code, analogous\u00a0 to that in force in these Islands.\"<\/blockquote>After a full consideration and review of the reasons upon which\u00a0 our decision in that case was based we\u00a0 adhere to the conclusions announced\u00a0 therein,\u00a0 and we are further of opinion,\u00a0 and so\u00a0 hold, that\u00a0 the injury done to the \"public interests\" by each and every separate theft of the contents of registered mail by post-office\u00a0 officials into whose\u00a0 hands it is intrusted for delivery is a \"grave\"\u00a0 injury thereto, and subjects\u00a0 the offender to the penalties prescribed in subsection\u00a0 1 of article 360 of the Penal\u00a0 Code.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 judgment\u00a0 of conviction and the sentence imposed by the\u00a0 trial court should be\u00a0 affirmed, with the costs of this instance\u00a0 against the appellant.\u00a0 So\u00a0 ordered.<br\/><br\/><i> Arellano, C.

Molina, having\u00a0 collected the amount of his judgment\u00a0 in case No.\u00a0 3402,\u00a0 remained a creditor of De la Riva for the amount of his judgments in the other two cases, numbered, respectively, 3829 and 4766.\u00a0\u00a0 It became apparent that De la Riva's property was insufficient to discharge all of these obligations, and the question of preference,\u00a0 if any,\u00a0 among the judgments arose.<br\/><br\/>In his complaint in this action Somes\u00a0 asserts that the judgment rendered in case No. 3402 is senior to those rendered in\u00a0 cases Nos. 3829 and 4766; that he, having paid,\u00a0 as surety for De la Riva, the judgment of Molina against the latter, is entitled to be subrogated to the\u00a0 rights and privileges\u00a0 of Molina, including a right\u00a0 of seniority\u00a0 of the judgment in case No. 3402.<br\/><br\/>This action\u00a0 was brought by the surety, Somes, for the purpose of having this court\u00a0 declare that the plaintiff is entitled to the subrogation above indicated as against not only the\u00a0 defendant De la Riva but also\u00a0 against the defendant and creditor Molina; and also that\u00a0 this court decide and decree that,\u00a0 having been\u00a0 so\u00a0 subrogated, the plaintiff shall enjoy the right\u00a0 of preference in satisfying his debt out of the property of De la Riva, as against Molina, the holder of the other two judgments in cases Nos. 3829 and 4766.<br\/><br\/>It must be remembered, in the first place, that the contract of purchase and sale, which is the basis of the various suits\u00a0 and proceedings between the parties, including the cause at\u00a0 bar, is a public document, executed as such by the parties thereto with all the formalities required for such purpose by the law.\u00a0 This being so, it is evident that, under the\u00a0 provisions of article 1924,\u00a0 subdivision\u00a0 3, of the Civil Code, preference is determined by the date of the public document and not by the dates of the judgments secured by virtue of it.\u00a0 The public document, for the purposes of said section, is not\u00a0 merged in any judgment obtained under it, and its date, rather than the dates of the judgments recovered by virtue of it, determines the priority of those judgments as\u00a0 to preference.\u00a0 There can, therefore, be no preference\u00a0 among\u00a0 the judgments in question.\u00a0 The debtor's property is divided among them pro rata, should such property be insufficient to pay them in full.<br\/><br\/>It must be borne\u00a0 in mind,\u00a0 in the second\u00a0 place, that the three judgments really\u00a0 constitute\u00a0 one debt.\u00a0\u00a0 They are but parts of a whole, namely,\u00a0 P134,636.12.\u00a0\u00a0 They are simply installments\u00a0 of one debt, the\u00a0 consideration of the contract of purchase and sale.\u00a0 That contract\u00a0 is an indivisible\u00a0 contract and\u00a0 its consideration single and\u00a0 entire.\u00a0\u00a0 (Roberts <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>.

Co.<i> vs.<\/i> Sprague (59 Minn., 208), cited in the majority opinion in\u00a0 support of the doctrine; and, indeed, I\u00a0 think an examination of all the cases cited in support of the rule will disclose the existence of a state of facts as to which the reason for the rule, as above set out, justified and required its application.<br\/><br\/>But\u00a0 no such reason for the rule or its application\u00a0 exists in the case at bar.\u00a0\u00a0 The only obligation\u00a0 assumed by the surety on the\" appeal bond given\u00a0 in action No. 3402 was that he\u00a0 would respond for the payment of the <i>judgment in that action.<\/i>\u00a0 No more\u00a0 than this was\u00a0\u00a0 required of him\u00a0 or could have been required of him.\u00a0\u00a0 For the payment of the judgment in that\u00a0 action the judgment creditor had\u00a0 the right to rely not only on the goods of the principal\u00a0 debtor but<i> in addition<\/i> on the security offered by the surety, and if the\u00a0 surety had\u00a0 paid merely a part of that judgment\u00a0 he could not equitably demand that for the recovery from\u00a0 the principal debtor of the amount so paid he should be permitted to exercise his right of\u00a0 subrogation before the judgment was wholly satisfied.\u00a0 This\u00a0 would be a\u00a0 proper case for the application of the rule.\u00a0 But as to the\u00a0 installments of the original debt, represented\u00a0 by\u00a0 judgments No. 3829 and No. 4766, the surety assumed no\u00a0 obligation whatever when he executed\u00a0 the appeal bond from judgment No. 3402. His assumption of\u00a0 the joint obligation with the\u00a0 principal debtor to pay the judgment in\u00a0 case No.\u00a0 3402 was\u00a0 in\u00a0 no sense an agreement that he\u00a0 would aid the debtor in the payment of other judgments which the creditor might secure for\u00a0 installments of\u00a0 the\u00a0 original\u00a0 indebtedness\u00a0 which had not yet become due and payable;\u00a0 nor\u00a0\u00a0 could the judgment creditor demand that,\u00a0 as to the\u00a0 installments for which those judgments\u00a0 were thereafter given, he should be placed in a better position than he was before the\u00a0 appeal\u00a0 was allowed from judgment No.\u00a0 3402.\u00a0 There\u00a0 might well have been a valid defense to the action\u00a0 to recover the installment reduced to judgment in action No. 3402, and no defense as to the\u00a0 other installments, and the law gave\u00a0 to the\u00a0 judgment debtor the right to have\u00a0 his appeal\u00a0 heard and execution stayed in that action without giving <i>additional<\/i> security for the\u00a0 payment of the other installments of the debt.\u00a0\u00a0 Yet the effect of the application of the rule\u00a0 by the majority in this case is to construe the bond executed by the surety to stay execution\u00a0 on the judgment appealed from, as though it were intended not only to secure that judgment, but\u00a0 also as an additional security for the other installments of the debt and the judgments taken\u00a0 therefor.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<br\/><br\/>That this is the effect will become very clear if we suppose that the three installments of the original indebtedness under\u00a0 consideration\u00a0 had been\u00a0 assigned by the creditor to A, B,\u00a0 and C; that A had reduced his claim against the principal debtor to\u00a0 judgment; that\u00a0 the\u00a0 principal debtor believing that he had a good cause of defense against the claim of A were to undertake to appeal from the judgment in favor of\u00a0 A.\u00a0\u00a0 Is\u00a0 it not manifest that under\u00a0 such\u00a0 circumstances the debtor would have a perfect right to appeal the judgment in favor of A and to secure a stay of execution <i>upon that judgment <\/i>by giving to A a bond\u00a0 to secure the ultimate payment of his judgment, without at the same time giving additional security to B\u00a0 and C to secure the payment of the installments assigned to them?\u00a0 Before the appeal from\u00a0 A's judgment, A,\u00a0 B, and C were each equally entitled to payment of their claims from the goods of the common debtor, or, in other words, to receive one-third of the proceeds, if the\u00a0 common debtor's goods were sold for the payment\u00a0 of their claims and were found insufficient to satisfy these claims in full.\u00a0\u00a0 But the effect of the application\u00a0 of the rule laid down in\u00a0 the majority opinion is to require the surety to bind himself for the payment not only of A's\u00a0 judgment,\u00a0 but to\u00a0 agree that\u00a0 when the\u00a0 appeal is granted\u00a0 and\u00a0 execution on A's\u00a0 judgment stayed,\u00a0 B\u00a0 and C will thereafter each\u00a0 be entitled to receive one-half of the proceeds of the sale of the debtor's property instead of one-third\u00a0 upon which alone they had a\u00a0 right to rely\u00a0 before the principal\u00a0 debtor took his appeal from A's judgment.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 equitable doctrine of subrogation as laid\u00a0 down\u00a0 in English and American jurisprudence was borrowed\u00a0 originally from the civil law, and, as might be expected, both the\u00a0 doctrine and its\u00a0 essential incidents are very\u00a0 clearly enunciated in the Spanish Civil\u00a0 Code, which is so\u00a0 largely based on the Civil Law.\u00a0\u00a0 (See arts. 1209-1213.)\u00a0\u00a0 Article 1213 is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"A creditor,\u00a0 to whom a partial payment has\u00a0 been made, may exercise his right to recover the rest,\u00a0 with preference to him who may have been subrogated\u00a0 in his place by virtue of partial payment of the very credit.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>This is the identical\u00a0 doctrine upon which the English and\u00a0 American cases cited in the majority opinion are based, and\u00a0 it is to be observed that the Spanish legislator carefully emphasizes the provision that the preference secured to the creditor exists only as to \"the very credit\" (<i>el\u00a0 mismo credito<\/i>), a partial payment of which is the basis of the right of subrogation which it is sought to assert.<br\/><br\/>In the case at bar, I think it is clear that the \"very credit\" (<i>el mismo credito<\/i>)\u00a0 and\u00a0 the \"<i>only credit<\/i>\" for the payment of which in whole or in part\u00a0 the creditor had any right to look to the surety was the judgment in action No. 3402, which was\u00a0 appealed.\u00a0 And this \"credit\" having\u00a0 been paid in full, the provisions of article 1213 are clearly inapplicable for the\u00a0 purpose of\u00a0 giving the creditor the preference\u00a0 which he seeks.\u00a0 For some purposes\u00a0 it may\u00a0 be admitted\u00a0 and is\u00a0 undoubtedly true that all of\u00a0 the\u00a0 installments were but\u00a0 parts of a single whole, to wit, the\u00a0 total indebtedness evidenced by the notarial instrument\u00a0 setting out\u00a0 the original indebtedness; but the only \"credit\" as to which, by the nature of the contract set out in the\u00a0 appeal bond and of the relations of the various parties thereto, the\u00a0 surety was\u00a0 in anywise bound,\u00a0 was the judgment\u00a0 in action No. 3402.\u00a0\u00a0 It was the only\u00a0 credit by reference\u00a0 to which he became obligated,\u00a0 and in thus obligating himself the law did not require nor could the creditor require that the security given by the surety would necessarily\u00a0 be applied so as to give additional security to\u00a0 the creditor for the\u00a0 payment of other claims\u00a0 against the principal\u00a0 debtor. As between the creditor and the principal\u00a0 debtor, all the installments in question may be deemed to be parts of a single whole, but in a matter wherein the respective rights of the surety, the creditor,\u00a0 and the\u00a0 principal debtor are under\u00a0 consideration,\u00a0 the credit reduced to judgment in action\u00a0 No. 3402\u00a0 was wholly independent of\u00a0 and distinct from the remaining installments of the original\u00a0 indebtedness.\u00a0\u00a0 So far as their\u00a0 relations were jointly affected the only credit and the total credit involved was the judgment credit established in that action.\u00a0\u00a0 And the surety having paid that judgment in full, so that the question is not one of partial payments, the creditor has no right of preference under the provisions of\u00a0 article 1213 of the code.<br\/><\/div>",

On expert examination it was found that Simeon Belen had a stab wound on the .inner front part of the left arm above the elbow, running downward and\u00a0 backward; the said wound was\u00a0 13 centimeters\u00a0 long and 5 centimeters deep, the humeral artery, the superficial and internal veins, and the median nerve of the region\u00a0 being severed. The physician who made the examination certified and declared at the trial that, in his opinion, the true cause of the death of the deceased Simeon Belen was the hemorrhage caused by the said wounds and the severing of the veins and artery.<br\/><br\/>Apolonio\u00a0 Manalo,\u00a0 a boy 16 years of age, cousin of the deceased, declared, as the first witness for the prosecution and as the only one who witnessed the affair, that on the evening of\u00a0 the said day, the 2d of June, 1908,\u00a0 at about 6 o'clock, he and his cousin Simeon Belen went to a barrio to inspect a zacate field\u00a0 belonging to Belen; that they remained for\u00a0 about two hours in the house belonging to an aunt\u00a0 of theirs and situated\u00a0 in that barrio, there\u00a0 being no one else in\u00a0 the house at that time; that they afterwards returned to\u00a0 the town; that Simeon Belen was armed with a bolo; that when they were returning, at about 10 o'clock p. m., and near the house of one Marcelino Biglete, \"I\u2014the witness says\u2014felt the desire to urinate, but, before finishing, I saw the two men (Facundo Bardelas and his cousin Belen) quarreling, and when I was about 10 brazas from them, my cousin's opponent\u00a0 ran away,\u00a0 and my cousin was crying and calling upon me to revenge him; then I followed after\u00a0 Facundo\u00a0 Bardelas, and\u00a0 when I\u00a0 was some\u00a0 distance away my cousin again called out and told me to take him to his house;\" that when he went again to his cousin, the latter was standing and wounded,\u00a0 but he then no longer felt able to reach his home and preferred to be taken to a nearby house,\u00a0 which belonged to Gelasio Bagsic;\u00a0 that he took him to the said house, the wounded man leaning upon him, and after he had called the inmates of the house they entered it; that immediately thereafter he left his cousin under the care of Bagsic and his wife, and then proceeded to the town to inform the wounded man's mother of what had happened; that he returned\u00a0 to Bagsic's house with a policeman; that before the\u00a0 quarrel, as he was\u00a0 urinating, he\u00a0 did not\u00a0 notice whether\u00a0 anyone had passed\u00a0 along\u00a0 the road where they were walking; that when he approached his cousin he had seen no one else, and that\u00a0 he does\u00a0 not know whether anyone could have seen the quarrel, which took place in front of the house of Marcelino Biglete; that, when they went to see the\u00a0 zacate field, Belen carried\u00a0 his bolo sheathed at his waist, but in the moment of the quarrel, when the witness approached, he saw that the former had the bolo in his hand, but he could not see whether or not it was stained with blood because, as\u00a0 stated, he immediately went in pursuit of the other man, and he only saw\u00a0 the bloody bolo when he was conducting his cousin to the house of Bagsic.<br\/><blockquote>\"Q.

The last\u00a0 witness for the\u00a0 prosecution, Francisco Olove, declared that on the night of the occurrence, when he was returning from the distillery in which he worked, accompanied\u00a0 by Roman Amatorio, walking\u00a0 toward his house, situated in the vicinity of the houses of Marcelino Biglete and Gelasio Bagsic heretofore mentioned, he met Facundo Bardelas in the road opposite the house of Marcelino Biglete, and he then met\u00a0 Simeon Belen and another person who was standing close to a fence, facing the\u00a0 same; that Bardelas was standing with his right hand on his waist or in his pocket;\u00a0 that he\u00a0 called the latter by\u00a0 his name and received an answer and then continued\u00a0 on his way. Facundo\u00a0 Bardelas\u00a0 testified that on the night of\u00a0 the 2d of June,\u00a0 1908, he left\u00a0 his house after supper\u00a0 to visit a friend of his, one Felicidad Fule, in the\u00a0 barrio of San Rafael.\u00a0\u00a0 \"When I was at a certain distance from the house of Marcelino Biglete\u2014he says\u2014I saw two men standing in front of the house of Gregorio Fule; on passing in\u00a0 front of\u00a0 the\u00a0 house of\u00a0 Marcelino,\u00a0 Apolonio and\u00a0 Simeon\u00a0 came toward me, and Simeon seized me by the front of my shirt and asked me where I was going; I replied that I was going to visit an acquaintance of mine, Felicidad Fule; then Simeon told me:\u00a0 'Why do you go there?,' to which I replied asking why I should not goy she being an unmarried woman; then he caught me by\u00a0 the neck and, squeezing it,\u00a0 he said to his companion: pegale un tajo,\u00a0 pegale!\u00a0 (strike him, strike him), then with my left hand I endeavored to remove his hand from my neck, and I then heard Apolonio Manalo tell Simeon Belen\u00a0 to strike me; with my left hand I beat the left hand of Simeon Belen, with which he was grasping my neck, in order to make him let go, whereupon,\u00a0 Simeon Belen stabbed at me; I was able to prevent the blow with my left\u00a0 hand and at\u00a0 the same time\u00a0 I also\u00a0 struck\u00a0 him and ran away.\"\u00a0 Upon being questioned with what weapon he struck the blow, he said that it was a penknife, which, having been exhibited, is described in the following terms: \"A penknife of those usually called\u00a0 a fan knife,\u00a0 sharp pointed, with a metal handle, the blade being 8 centimeters long and the handle 10 centimeters'\u00a0 'When he was asked what happened when he ran away, he said that Apolonio Manalo ran after him, without succeeding in catching him, and that he did not stop running until he reached his house, and\u00a0 that\u00a0 when he arrived there\u00a0 he\u00a0 noticed\u00a0 that he\u00a0 had an injury in the upper part of\u00a0 his left\u00a0 hand and another on his neck, in consequence of \"the squeezing that Simeon Belen\u00a0 gave me;\"\u00a0 these injuries\u00a0 were\u00a0 examined by the president of the local board of health.<br\/><br\/>It is shown by the record that, on the 4th of June, 1908, the same physician who had examined the corpse of Simeon Belen on the previous day,\u00a0 examined Bardelas and certified that he had a sharp cut on the back of his left hand, penetrating the skin, 2\u00a3 centimeters in length; and a\u00a0 scratch on the skin about the middle\u00a0 of the left side of the neck, 2 centimeters long, running\u00a0 horizontally\u00a0 to the base of the neck; both injuries were slight; that the first would heal in five days with medical assistance, and the second without any assistance.\u00a0 In the record of the proceedings, on July 30, which was the\u00a0 date of the trial, the following appears: \"The accused exhibits before\u00a0 the court the scar he has at the place\u00a0 described in\u00a0 the medical certificate (Exhibit No. 1), that is, in\u00a0 the middle of the back of the left hand, 3 centimeters in length, which scar is vertical to the bones of the hand.\u00a0\u00a0 And\u00a0 he exhibited\u00a0 another small scar,\u00a0 1 centimeters long, of an irregular form,\u00a0 also vertical with relation to the axis, of the neck and on\u00a0 the left side.\" The assistant counsel for the prosecution asked the court to appoint two expert physicians to determine clearly:\u00a0 (1) the position in which\u00a0 the\u00a0 accused was\u00a0 when he received that wound, and with respect to the scar, when and from what direction he received the blow; (2) whether a violent blow given with a bolo would have resulted in\u00a0 the simple cutting of the skin without severing any artery or vein.<br\/><br\/>The two physicians who testified,\u00a0 Dr. Gertrudo\u00a0 de los Reyes and Dr. Donato Montinola, stated that it is likely that the said injury was caused by the blow which the deceased attempted to give the accused, but the physician first named thinks that, judging from the injured tissues, the bolo did not fall\u00a0 vertically upon the back of the hand, but rather obliquely so that the\u00a0 man\u00a0 was able to stop the bolo with the back of his hand and was wounded superficially, or, as the other physician\u00a0 says, the direction was oblique and the injury received by the accused might have been the effect of the blow struck by the deceased.<br\/><br\/>It has not been shown that the said injury was not the effect of the unlawful aggression attributed to the deceased, which aggression was corroborated by the attitude in which he was\u00a0 found by the\u00a0 witness for the\u00a0 prosecution who accompanied him, who states that, when he approached, he saw him with the bolo unsheathed\u00a0 and that he kept it in his hand until he arrived\u00a0 at the house\u00a0 to\u00a0 which he\u00a0 was taken.<br\/><br\/>The three circumstances constituting lawful\u00a0 self-defense, and exemption from criminal responsibility, having been duly proven, the judgment appealed from can not be\u00a0 sustained.<br\/><br\/>The said judgment is hereby reversed and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Facundo Bardelas\u00a0<\/span> is acquitted with the costs of both instances <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">de oficio<\/span>.

that the process of putrefaction\u00a0 had altered\u00a0 the\u00a0 outer\u00a0 color, consistency, and form\u00a0 of\u00a0 the soft tissues,\u00a0 it\u00a0 was not possible to detect\u00a0 slight injuries, and there being no serious ones, and in view of the fact that the heart was abnormal and greatly hypertrophied, especially in its entire left auricle and right ventricle and auricle, it is probable that the said individual died of heart disease due to mitral\u00a0 insufficiency.<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing, the provincial fiscal filed a complaint with the Court\u00a0 of First Instance of Pampanga, on the 15th of June, 1908, charging Francisco\u00a0 Samea\u00a0 with the crime of homicide.\u00a0 The trial judge entered judgment on the 23d of September of the same year, sentencing Francisco Samea to the penalty of six years of <i>prision correccional<\/i>,\u00a0 with the accessory penalties, to indemnify the widow and heirs of the deceased in the sum of Pl,000 and, in case of insolvency, to suffer the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment, and to pay the costs, but to be credited with one-half of the period of detention.<br\/><br\/>From the\u00a0 above-stated facts\u00a0 it\u00a0 is clearly\u00a0 shown that Braulio Magbag died in consequence of the blows inflicted with a stick upon several parts of his body, and from kicks in the stomach and testicles, in consequence of which\u00a0 ill treatment he fell to the ground, and after dragging himself, with the assistance of his wife, to a distance\u00a0 of about 30 yards, there died.\u00a0\u00a0 The act constitutes the crime of homicide, defined and punished by article 404 of the Penal Code, because the deceased lost his life as a result of the violent aggression of which he was the victim, none of the circumstances which\u00a0 characterize\u00a0 it as\u00a0 murder being present therein.<br\/><br\/>It is to be regretted that the post-mortem examination was made\u00a0 on the third day, and after the body had been buried, for which reason the surgeon who made the autopsy stated that, owing to the putrified state of the\u00a0 body it was impossible\u00a0 to make a thorough examination, and the data obtained both from the outside of the body and from the viscera\u00a0 did not permit him to\u00a0 positively determine how Braulio Magbag met his death; but he stated in his certificate, and in\u00a0 his testimony at the trial of the case, that he found a hypertrophy of the heart, for which reason he believed that the man\u00a0 died\u00a0 of heart disease due\u00a0 to mitral insufficiency.<br\/><br\/>Three witnesses, Juliana David, Juana\u00a0 Sangalang,\u00a0 and Marcelina Tulabut, saw\u00a0 the ill treatment\u00a0 received by the deceased from\u00a0 the accused\u00a0 Samea on\u00a0 the street near the gate of his yard and in\u00a0 view of the entire neighborhood, and they so testified in the case; the first\u00a0 of the above-named witnesses, who\u00a0 was the wife of the deceased, together with several residents, among whom\u00a0 was Damian Garcia, who responded to her cries, was foremost in rendering assistance to the ill-treated man who\u00a0 was found in a dying state, so seriously injured that\u00a0 he died shortly afterwards and his body was removed to\u00a0 the\u00a0 house\u00a0 of Bonifacio\u00a0 David who lived near by.\u00a0\u00a0 It should further be noted that it was young Juana Sangalang who\u00a0 hailed the unfortunate\u00a0 Braulio, by direction of the accused, and when the latter appeared the accused abused\u00a0 and ill treated him as already stated.<br\/><br\/>The testimony of the witnesses introduced by the defense did not succeed in overcoming\u00a0 that of the witnesses for the prosecution, as may be seen from the mere reading of the testimony of all of them, it appearing from the subsequent statements of the widow of the deceased and of the said eyewitness, Juana Sangalang, that friends of the defendant offered them money to conceal the real cause of the death of Braulio Magbag.<br\/><br\/>It being proven\u00a0 that Braulio Magbag was maltreated by said blows and kicks, even though the heart trouble from which he suffered may have contributed in a great measure to his death, it can not be denied\u00a0 that he would\u00a0 probably not have\u00a0 died\u00a0 if\u00a0 he\u00a0 had\u00a0 not been maltreated, as\u00a0 the ill treatment must have produced such a great physical shock and other effects that, owing to\u00a0 complications that ensued, perhaps partly\u00a0 due to the heart trouble with which he was afflicted, his death ensued.\u00a0 It is probable the same\u00a0 results would not have occurred in the case\u00a0 of a strong, healthy man.<br\/><br\/>The liability of the defendant as the sole author of the ill treatment inflicted\u00a0 upon the deceased Magbag\u00a0 is\u00a0 manifest and\u00a0 incontrovertible,\u00a0 because if the\u00a0 deceased\u00a0 fell\u00a0 to\u00a0 the ground and died\u00a0 shortly after\u00a0 having been cruelly maltreated by Samea,\u00a0 it can not be denied that the latter is the only one responsible for the crime of homicide arising from the violent death of the late Magbag.<br\/><br\/>It\u00a0 may\u00a0 be true that the latter was suffering\u00a0 from heart trouble, judging from the statements of the physician who made the\u00a0 autopsy, but it is none the less\u00a0 true\u00a0 that the ill treatment inflicted by the defendant was the cause of such fatal\u00a0 result and hastened the death of a man who, a moment\u00a0 previously,\u00a0 was apparently\u00a0 in\u00a0 good health,\u00a0 moved about freely, properly\u00a0 performed his duties in the fields and otherwise\u00a0 executed the orders of the accused, as stated by his widow.<br\/><br\/>Any person who commits an unlawful act is\u00a0 responsible for all the consequences arising therefrom; the fact that he does not intend to cause the death of the party abused does not exempt him from liability.\u00a0 Francisco Samea, willfully and without authority therefor, ill treated Braulio Magbag, beating him with a stick and kicking him, as aforesaid, thereby\u00a0 committing illegal acts\u00a0 contrary to\u00a0 the\u00a0 criminal law.\u00a0 Being\u00a0 the aggressor,\u00a0 he is necessarily responsible for all\u00a0 the consequences; the attempt to prove\u00a0 that\u00a0 the deceased\u00a0 used\u00a0 to suffer from fever and was in delicate health can not mitigate the\u00a0 fatal result,\u00a0 because\u00a0 one who maltreats a sick person who dies from the result of such violence\u00a0 is responsible for his death, that is to\u00a0 say,\u00a0 for the crime of homicide.<br\/><br\/>In\u00a0 the\u00a0 commission of the crime herein prosecuted\u00a0 the presence of mitigating circumstance No.\u00a0 3 of article 9 of the Penal Code must be considered, because we must assume that,\u00a0 notwithstanding the cruelty with which\u00a0 the\u00a0 deceased was maltreated for such\u00a0 trifling motive, the\u00a0 accused\u00a0 did not, as a matter of fact, intend to kill him; hence\u00a0 the penalty should be imposed in\u00a0 the minimum\u00a0 degree Circumstance 7 of the same article can not be allowed in\u00a0 his favor, for the reason that the conduct of the defendant in severely\u00a0 and unreasonably maltreating the deceased was unjustifiable.\u00a0 On the other hand, there is no aggravating circumstance present in the case.<br\/><br\/>For the reason above\u00a0 set forth, by which\u00a0 the alleged errors assigned in the judgment\u00a0 appealed from have been refuted, it is our opinion that the same should be reversed, and that Francisco Samea should be and is hereby sentenced to the penalty of twelve\u00a0 years and one\u00a0 day\u00a0 of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">reclusion temporal,<\/span> to suffer the accessory penalties of article 59 of the code, to indemnify the widow and heirs in the sum of P1,000, and to pay the costs of both instances.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

The\u00a0 validity of that document in so far as it shows an indebtedness against Maria Aniversario and its effectiveness against\u00a0 her have not,\u00a0 however, been determined.\u00a0\u00a0 She is not a party to this action.\u00a0\u00a0 No\u00a0 judgment can be rendered affecting her rights or liabilities under said instrument.\u00a0 If said instrument is invalid or for any other cause unenforceable against her,\u00a0 it would be wholly unjust, by\u00a0 declaring its preference over a debt acknowledged by and conclusive against her, to require that said funds\u00a0 be paid over to the holder\u00a0 of said document.\u00a0 That\u00a0 would be to\u00a0 require her to pay\u00a0 a debt\u00a0 which\u00a0 has not only not been shown to be enforceable against her but which, as a witness for the defendant Martinez on the trial of this\u00a0 cause, she expressly and vehemently repudiated as a valid claim against her.<br\/><br\/>The judgment\u00a0 is, therefore, reversed;\u00a0 and it is ordered that the\u00a0 cause be\u00a0 returned to the court below; that the plaintiff\u00a0 bring in\u00a0 Maria\u00a0 Aniversario\u00a0 as\u00a0 a\u00a0 party to\u00a0 this action,\u00a0 and that she be given an opportunity to make her defense, if she have any, to the document in question under proper procedure.\u00a0 No finding as to costs.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Jacks and Milliron, chief of the department of the port of Cebu\u00a0 and\u00a0 internal revuene agent of Cebu, respectively, went aboard the steamship <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Erroll <\/span>to inspect and search its cargo, and found, first in a cabin near the saloon, one sack (Exhibit A) and afterwards in the\u00a0 hold, another sack\u00a0 (Exhibit B). The sack referred\u00a0 to as Exhibit A contained 49 cans of opium, and the other, Exhibit B, the larger sack, also contained several cans\u00a0 of the same substance.\u00a0\u00a0 The hold, in which the sack mentioned in\u00a0 Exhibit\u00a0 B was found, was under the defendant's control, who,\u00a0 moreover,\u00a0 freely and of his own will and accord admitted that this sack, as well as the other referred to in Exhibit B\u00a0 and\u00a0 found\u00a0 in the cabin, belonged to\u00a0 him.\u00a0 The said defendant also\u00a0 stated,\u00a0 freely and voluntarily, that he had bought these sacks of opium in Hongkong with the intention of selling them as contraband in Mexico or Vera Cruz, and that,\u00a0 as his hold had already been searched several times for\u00a0 opium, he ordered two other Chinamen to keep the sack.\u00a0 Exhibit A.\"<\/blockquote>It is to be taken into account that the two sacks of opium, designated as Exhibits A\u00a0 and B,\u00a0 properly constitute the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">corpus delicti.<\/span>\u00a0 Moreover, another lot of four cans of opium, marked, as Exhibit C, was the\u00a0 subject matter of investigation at the trial, and with respect to which the chief of the department of the\u00a0 port of Cebu testified that they were found\u00a0 in the part of the ship where the firemen habitually sleep,\u00a0 and\u00a0 that they were delivered to the first officer of the ship to be returned to the said\u00a0 firemen after the vessel should have\u00a0 left the\u00a0 Philippines, because the firemen and crew of foreign vessels, pursuant to the\u00a0 instructions he had from the\u00a0 Manila custom-house, were permitted to\u00a0 retain certain amounts of opium, always\u00a0 provided it should not be taken ashore.<br\/><br\/>And, finally, another can of opium, marked \"Exhibit D,\" is also<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> corpus delicti <\/span>and important as evidence in this cause.\u00a0 With\u00a0 regard to this the\u00a0 internal revenue\u00a0 agent testified as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Fiscal. What is it?<br\/><br\/>\"Witness. It is a can of opium which was\u00a0 bought from the defendant by a\u00a0 secret service agent and taken to the office of the governor to prove that the accused had opium in his possession to sell.\"<\/blockquote>On motion by the defense, the court ruled that this answer might be stricken out \"because it refers to a sale.\"\u00a0 But, with respect to this answer, the chief of the department of customs had already given this testimony, to wit:<br\/><blockquote>\"Fiscal. Who asked you to search the vessel?<br\/><br\/>\"Witness. The internal-revenue agent came to my office and said that a party brought him a\u00a0 sample\u00a0 of opium and that the same party knew that there was more opium\u00a0 on board the steamer,\u00a0 and the agent\u00a0 asked that the vessel\u00a0 be searched.\"<\/blockquote>The defense moved\u00a0 that this\u00a0 testimony be rejected,\u00a0 on the ground of\u00a0 its being hearsay\u00a0 evidence, and the court only ordered that the\u00a0 part thereof \"that there\u00a0 was more opium on board the vessel\" be stricken out.<br\/><br\/>The defense, to abbreviate proceedings, admitted that the receptacles mentioned as Exhibits A, B, and C, contained opium and were\u00a0 found on board\u00a0 the steamship Erroll, a vessel of English nationality, and that it was true that the defendant stated\u00a0 that\u00a0 these sacks of opium\u00a0 were his and that he had them in his possession.<br\/><br\/>According to the testimony of the internal-revenue agent, the defendant stated to him, in the presence of the provincial fiscal, of a Chinese interpreter (who afterwards\u00a0 was not needed,\u00a0 because the defendant spoke English), the warden of the jail, and four guards,\u00a0 that\u00a0 the opium seized in the vessel had been bought by him in Hongkong, at three pesos for each round can and five pesos for each one of the others, for the purpose of selling it, as contraband, in Mexico and Puerto de Vera Cruz; that on the 15th the vessel\u00a0 arrived at Cebu, and on the same day he sold opium; that he had tried to sell opium for P16\u00a0 a can; that he had a contract to sell an\u00a0 amount of the value of about P500; that\u00a0 the opium found in the room of the other two Chinamen prosecuted in another cause,\u00a0 was his, and that he had left it in their stateroom to avoid its being found in\u00a0 his room, which had already\u00a0 been searched many times; and that, according\u00a0 to the defendant, the contents of the large sack was 80 cans of opium,\u00a0 and of the small one, 49, and the total number,\u00a0 129.<br\/><br\/>It\u00a0 was\u00a0 established that the steamship Erroll was of English nationality, that it came from Hongkong, and that it was bound for Mexico, via the\u00a0 call ports of Manila and Cebu.<br\/><br\/>The defense moved for\u00a0 a dismissal of the case, on the grounds that the court had no jurisdiction to try the same and the facts concerned therein did not constitute a crime. The fiscal, at the conclusion of his argument, asked that the maximum penalty of the law be imposed upon the defendant, in view of the considerable amount of opium seized.\u00a0 The court ruled that\u00a0 it did not lack jurisdiction, inasmuch as the crime\u00a0 had been committed\u00a0 within its district, on the wharf of Cebu,<br\/><br\/>The court sentenced the defendant to five years'\u00a0 imprisonment, to pay a fine of P10,000, with additional subsidiary imprisonment in\u00a0 case of insolvency, though\u00a0 not\u00a0 to exceed one third of the\u00a0 principal\u00a0 penalty, and to the payment of the costs.\u00a0 It further ordered the confiscation, in favor of the Insular Government, of the exhibits\u00a0 presented in the case,\u00a0 and that, in the event of an appeal\u00a0 being taken or a bond\u00a0 given, or when the sentence should have been served, the defendant be not released\u00a0 from\u00a0 custody, but turned over to the customs authorities for the purpose of the fulfillment of the existing laws on immigration.<br\/><br\/>From this judgment, the defendant appealed to this court. The appeal having\u00a0 been heard, together with the allegations made therein by the parties, it is found: That, although the mere possession of a thing\u00a0 of prohibited use in these Islands, aboard a foreign vessel in transit, in any of their ports, does not, as a general rule, constitute a crime triable by the courts of this country,\u00a0 on account of\u00a0 such vessel being considered as an extension of\u00a0 its\u00a0 own\u00a0 nationality, the same rule does not apply when the article, whose use is prohibited within the Philippine Islands, in the present case a can of opium, is landed from the vessel upon Philippine soil, thus committing an open violation of the\u00a0 laws of the land, with respect to which, as\u00a0 it is a violation of the penal law in force at the place of the commission of the crime, only\u00a0 the court established in the said place itself has competent jurisdiction, in\u00a0 the\u00a0 absence of an agreement\u00a0 under an\u00a0 international treaty.<br\/><br\/>It is also found: That, even\u00a0 admitting that the quantity of the drug seized, the subject matter of the present case, was considerable, it does not appear that, on such account, the two penalties fixed\u00a0 by the law on the subject, should be imposed in the maximum degree.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, reducing the\u00a0 imprisonment and the fine imposed to six months and P1,000, respectively, we affirm in all\u00a0 other\u00a0 respects the\u00a0 judgment appealed from, with the costs of this instance\u00a0 against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Torres, Mapa,\u00a0 Johnson,\u00a0 Carson,\u00a0 Moreland,<\/span>\u00a0 and\u00a0<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> Trent, JJ.,\u00a0<\/span> concur.<\/div>",

JOSE MCMICKING, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/>\n<br\/>\nD E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TRENT, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">The document\u00a0 which forms the\u00a0 basis of this action is as follows:<br\/><br\/>\"Manila, February 12, 1909.\u00a0 \u2014Sold to C.\u00a0 B. Williams the following articles of household furniture; 1 piano, No. 16510; 1 oak wardrobe; 1\u00a0 Singer sewing machine;\u00a0 1 chiffonier, B, E. maple;\u00a0 1\u00a0 double iron bedstead and spring;\u00a0 1 writing desk, maple; 1\u00a0 dresser, maple;\u00a0 1 chest\u00a0 of drawers;\u00a0 6 American\u00a0 willow chairs; 2 maple wood center tables; 1 oak chair.<br\/><blockquote>\"The above articles were sold for a\u00a0 consideration of six hundred\u00a0 pesos,\u00a0 and Miss\u00a0 Hunter reserved the right\u00a0 to redeem said\u00a0 articles\u00a0 within sixty days\u00a0 on payment\u00a0 to Mr. Williams of six hundred pesos,\u00a0 with interest.\u00a0\u00a0 This amount covers the rent due Mr. Williams for the month of January, 1909.\u00a0 (Sgd.)\u00a0 A. Hunter.\u00a0 Witness: (Sgd.)\u00a0 Pablo Calderon.\u00a0\u00a0 (Sgd.)\u00a0\u00a0 M. Kahn.\"<\/blockquote>On the date this document was\u00a0 executed\u00a0 Miss Hunter was the owner of the personal property\u00a0 described therein and owed the plaintiff P600 as rent for the month of January,\u00a0 1909.\u00a0\u00a0 In\u00a0 the execution of the said\u00a0 document no attempt was made to defraud creditors.<br\/><br\/>The possession of the personal property described in this private document was never delivered to the plaintiff, but remained in the possession of Miss Hunter and was in her possession when levied\u00a0 upon by the defendant sheriff. After the sheriff had levied upon this property to satisfy an execution which had been issued against\u00a0 Miss Hunter the plaintiff intervened,\u00a0 claiming to be the owner by purchase of\u00a0 the\u00a0 said\u00a0 property.\u00a0 Notwithstanding\u00a0 this\u00a0 claim of the plaintiff the sheriff proceeded to sell the\u00a0 said property at public auction.<br\/><br\/>Subsequently thereto, and\u00a0 on the 19th of May, 1909, the plaintiff commenced this\u00a0 action in one of the Courts of First Instance of the city of Manila to recover\u00a0 the\u00a0 possession\u00a0 of the\u00a0 said personal property,\u00a0 or its value. Judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiff for the possession of this property or its\u00a0 value, which was\u00a0 fixed at P620.50.\u00a0 The defendant appealed.<br\/><br\/>The question to be determined is, whether or not the plaintiff became the owner\u00a0 of this personal property as against third parties by virtue of the document executed between him and Miss\u00a0 Hunter, inasmuch as the actual\u00a0 possession\u00a0 of the said property was never\u00a0 delivered to the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 private document\u00a0 executed by Miss\u00a0 Hunter in favor of the plaintiff can\u00a0 not be held to be a chattel mortgage\u00a0 in view of the provisions of section 4 of Act No. 1508, which section provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"A chattel mortgage shall not be valid against any person except the mortgagor, his executors or administrators, unless the possession of the property is delivered to and retained by the mortgagee or unless the mortgage is recorded in the office of the register of deeds of the province in which the mortgagor resides at the time of making the same, or, if he resides without\u00a0 the Philippine Islands, in the province in which the property is situated: Provided, however, That if the property is situated in a different province from that in which the mortgagor resides, the mortgage shall be recorded in the office\u00a0 of the register of deeds of both the province in which the mortgagor resides and that in which the property is situated,\u00a0 and for the purposes of this. Act the city of Manila shall be deemed to be a province.\"<\/blockquote>It will be noted that this section provides\u00a0 two ways for executing a valid\u00a0 chattel mortgage which\u00a0 shall operate against third persons; first, the property mortgaged must be delivered to and retained by the mortgagee; or, second, the mortgage must be recorded in the\u00a0 office of the register of deeds.<br\/><br\/>Under the above provisions of law the recording of the mortgage has\u00a0 the effect of\u00a0 a delivery of the property; in fact it is a\u00a0 symbolical\u00a0 delivery of the possession of\u00a0 such property to the mortgagee, as the world is presumed to know what appears\u00a0 in the public\u00a0 records in the register's office. In the case\u00a0 at bar the\u00a0 private document was not recorded, neither was\u00a0 the personal property delivered to the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>The private document executed by Miss Hunter in favor of the plaintiff does not constitute a contract of pledge for the reason that the thing sought to be pledged was not placed in the possession of the creditor or of a third person by common\u00a0 consent.\u00a0\u00a0 (U.\u00a0 S. <i>vs.<\/i> Terrell,\u00a0 2 Phil. Rep.,\u00a0 222; art. 1863, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>Evidently the parties attempted to execute what is known as a sale with a right to repurchase, as it appears in the document that the parties agreed that the personal property might be repurchased by the vendor within sixty days.\u00a0 The vendor did not part with the actual possession of this property until it\u00a0 was levied upon\u00a0 and taken out of her possession by the defendant sheriff\u00a0 by virtue of an execution.\u00a0\u00a0 This contract entered into between Miss Hunter and the plaintiff, although evidenced by a private unrecorded document, was valid between the parties executing it, but such contract did not have the effect of vesting the title to the personal property described therein in\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiff as\u00a0 against\u00a0 third parties, for the reason, as we have said, that the document was not recorded in accordance with the provisions of the Chattel Mortgage\u00a0 Law,\u00a0 neither\u00a0 was the actual, manual possession\u00a0 of said property\u00a0 delivered to the plaintiff.\u00a0\u00a0 (Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Wilson, 8 Phil. Rep., 51; Kuenzle &amp; Streiff <i>vs<\/i>. Macke &amp; Chandler, 14 Phil. Rep., 610.)<br\/><br\/>The doctrine\u00a0 laid\u00a0 down\u00a0 in the last case is, we think, decisive of\u00a0 the case at bar, as the facts in the one are almost identical with the facts in the other, with the exception that in the first the action was brought against the sheriff and the purchasers of the personal property at an execution sale, whereas in the\u00a0 case\u00a0 under consideration the action was brought against the sheriff for the return of the property or its value.\u00a0 Under these facts we see no difference between the position of the sheriff\u00a0 and that of a purchaser\u00a0 at\u00a0 an execution sale.\u00a0\u00a0 The doctrine laid down in these cases is not in conflict with that announced in the cases cited in the brief of the plaintiff,<br\/><br\/>In the case of Bean<i> vs<\/i>. Cadwallader\u00a0 Company\u00a0 (10 Phil. Rep., 606), which is relied upon by counsel for the plaintiff, the action\u00a0 was brought by the administrator of one of the contracting parties against\u00a0 the other party to the contract. The\u00a0 interest of\u00a0 third\u00a0 parties was not involved.\u00a0\u00a0 The contract was valid between the parties executing it and their administrators.<br\/><br\/>In the case of\u00a0 Alvarez <i>vs.<\/i> Montinola\u00a0 (1 Phil. Rep., 624), the facts were the same as in\u00a0 the\u00a0 case at bar,\u00a0 with the marked difference that the possession of the personal property was actually delivered\u00a0 to the purchaser and remained in his possession until it was attached\u00a0 at the instance of Montinola.\u00a0\u00a0 If these\u00a0 animals had remained in the possession of the vendor the result of the case would have been different.<br\/><br\/>In the case\u00a0 of Olsen <i>vs.<\/i> Yearsley (11\u00a0 Phil. Rep., 178), the defendant\u00a0 bought the\u00a0 cash register in good faith, and, \"if he had bought it\u00a0 from the true owner he would have brought himself under the protection of article 1473 of the Civil Code, providing that when a thing is sold to different buyers the property goes\u00a0 to him who\u00a0 first obtains possession.\"\u00a0 This clearly distinguishes\u00a0 this\u00a0 case from the one under consideration.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the plaintiff raises a new question on appeal, which was evidently not brought out\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 court below, and\u00a0 that is, that\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiff is\u00a0 entitled to judgment by reason of the fact that the debt incurred by Miss Hunter was\u00a0 for rents for the month of January, 1909, and under the provisions of paragraph 7\u00a0 of article 1922 of the Civil Code he must be considered a preferred creditor.\u00a0 In order to do this\u00a0 it would be necessary to\u00a0 make Miss Hunter a party (McMicking<i> vs<\/i>. Martinez, 15 Phil. Rep., 204), and to convert this action of replevin\u00a0 into an action to determine the rights and\u00a0 preferences of creditors.\u00a0 All of the parties, including the court\u00a0 below, treated\u00a0 this action in that court as one of replevin only.\u00a0\u00a0 The plaintiff based this action absolutely on the question of ownership.\u00a0 He raised no question, as far as this record\u00a0 shows,\u00a0 of preferential creditors.\u00a0 He relied upon the private document executed in his favor by\u00a0 Miss Hunter as fixing in him the title to this property and authorizing him to recover the same or its value.\u00a0 If he had been the owner of this property by virtue of this document he certainly could have recovered the\u00a0 possession of the same, or its value in case the actual possession could not have been had.\u00a0\u00a0 He can not now convert his action into one determining the relative rights of creditors.\u00a0\u00a0 If this were true, we are unable to see how, on\u00a0 this basis, the plaintiff could be classified or declared\u00a0 a preferred\u00a0 creditor\u00a0 and have\u00a0 the proceeds of the sale of this personal property applied to the payment of his debt for the reason that the record does not show that this debt of P600 in favor\u00a0 of the plaintiff was contracted by\u00a0 Miss Hunter as rents for the premises upon which the personal property was found\u00a0 when levied upon by the sheriff.\u00a0 The only proof in the record which tends to show the origin of this debt is one expression found in the private\u00a0 document above quoted,\u00a0 which is,\u00a0 \"This amount covers the\u00a0 rent due Mr. Williams for the month\u00a0 of January, 1909.\"\u00a0\u00a0 The trial court said, with reference to this point, that Miss Hunter was indebted to the\u00a0 plaintiff in the sum of P600 as rent covering the month of January,\u00a0 1909, and that the plaintiff lived in the same house where the furniture was located.\u00a0\u00a0 These facts are not sufficient to show that the P600 was due\u00a0 Williams for rent for the identical premises where Miss Hunter was living and where the property was when the sheriff took it into possession.<br\/><br\/>For these reasons the judgment appealed from is, therefore,\u00a0 reversed, and the defendant absolved, without any special ruling as to costs.<br\/><br\/><i> Arellano, C.

GABRIEL DIAZ, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/>\n<br\/>\nD E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">At about 7 o'clock on the morning of the 30th of May, 1906,\u00a0 Cornelio Alcansaren, a laborer employed on\u00a0 the hacienda of San Antonio, went to Gabriel Diaz, an employee in charge of said hacienda,\u00a0 and asked to be excused from work that day because he had been confessed the day before in preparation for his marriage.\u00a0\u00a0 Diaz became angry and, instead of granting the permission asked for,\u00a0 illtreated the laborer, Alcansaren, striking him with his clenched fist and kicking him, thereby inflicting upon the said laborer various contusions\u00a0 and bruises, in\u00a0 consequence\u00a0 of\u00a0 which\u00a0 the illtreated man was rendered unable to work and took to Mb bed, where he was confined until he died at 5 o'clock on the afternoon of June 26, following.<br\/><br\/>The affair was reported on the 31st of May, 1906, to the justice of the peace of San Carlos, within whose jurisdiction the said hacienda lay.\u00a0\u00a0 The justice at once investigated the matter, and, after examining some witnesses, sentenced the accused on June 4,1906, to pay a fine of 50 pesetas and costs.<br\/><br\/>However, as the injured party died on the 26th\u00a0 of\u00a0 said month, the\u00a0 justice of the\u00a0 peace, by order of the Court of First Instance, ordered Luis Garcia Suarez,\u00a0 a Spanish\u00a0 surgeon, to make a post-mortem examination of the body of the deceased.\u00a0 After the autopsy the surgeon reported that he had found discolorations upon the neck and abrasions upon the throat, both sides, and the abdomen, from which when\u00a0 opened\u00a0 discolored\u00a0 blood emanated, and that the stomach, bladder, kidneys, liver, and the spleen were discolored.\u00a0 The justice of\u00a0 the peace thereupon\u00a0 found the accused guilty of homicide and forwarded the record of the preliminary investigation\u00a0 to the provincial fiscal.<br\/><br\/>On the 5th of September of the same year the\u00a0 last-named officer filed a complaint with the Court of First Instance, charging Gabriel\u00a0 Diaz with the crime of homicide.\u00a0 Proceedings were instituted,\u00a0 and the trial court entered judgment on the 24th of December, 1907, sentencing the accused to the penalty\u00a0 of six years and one day\u00a0 of <i>prision mayor<\/i> and the\u00a0 accessory penalties, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of P1,000, and to pay the costs.\u00a0 From said judgment the accused appealed, in writing, on the 17th of January, 1908.<br\/><br\/>From the above-stated facts it appears\u00a0 that the crime of homicide, defined by article 404 of the Penal Code, has been fully proven, inasmuch as it has been satisfactorily established in the present case\u00a0 that in consequence of blows struck with the clenched fist and kicks inflicted\u00a0 upon Cornelio Alcansaren, an agricultural laborer, on the morning of May 30, 1906, he received serious internal injuries in the neck, sides, stomach, and lower abdomen,\u00a0 which\u00a0 caused his death on the afternoon of June 26, 1906.<br\/><br\/>The accused,\u00a0 Gabriel\u00a0 Diaz, pleaded\u00a0 not guilty\u00a0 at the trial for homicide, but when being tried\u00a0 for misdemeanor before the\u00a0 justice of the\u00a0 peace of San\u00a0 Carlos,\u00a0 Occidental Negros,\u00a0 upon being informed of the complaint presented on the 31st of May, by Maria Condeno, the mother-in-law of the deceased, he answered that he would\u00a0 plead guilty because he had given decedent two or three slaps in the face.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding the deficiencies\u00a0 and irregularities that are observed in\u00a0 the prosecution of this case, the following facts undeniably took place: That Cornelio Alcansaren was cruelly maltreated by being\u00a0 punched and kicked by Gabriel Diaz on the morning of May 30; that in consequence of said maltreatment the injured man was rendered unable to work and became seriously ill; that, prostrated in bed and unable to urinate, he was found on the following day, first by two policemen\u00a0 who\u00a0 went to see ,him, and afterwards by the justice of the peace who called at the house; that the said justice of the peace testified that the injured man had the right thumb dislocated, a black swelling\u00a0 on the\u00a0 abdomen, at the navel, a scratch on the right side of the chest, another on the throat, and a contusion in\u00a0 the face; he\u00a0 said that the scratches were,not serious,\u00a0 but that the contusions on the abdomen and chest appeared of doubtful prognosis, all of which details were corroborated\u00a0 by the result of the autopsy; that besides the injured man and his mother-in-law, several\u00a0 eyewitnesses, Fabian Aracan, Miguel Bataen, and Juan\u00a0 Lanag, testified to the truth and reality of\u00a0 said maltreatment,\u00a0 the two last named having testified in the first trial\u00a0 for misdemeanor; that twenty-eight\u00a0 days\u00a0 after the aggression the injured man died on the afternoon of the last day, and the record does not show that his death was due to illness other than that produced by the ill treatment he received.\u00a0\u00a0 All this\u00a0 was shown in the proceedings in\u00a0 said trial (folios 36-40) as well as in the preliminary investigation made\u00a0 by the aforesaid justice of the peace\u00a0 after the 27th of June, following the death of the\u00a0 injured man, by virtue of the complaint filed by his mother-in-law, Maria Condeno, wherein appears the result\u00a0 of the autopsy\u00a0 previously referred to.<br\/><br\/>Hence the culpability of the accused Gabriel Diaz as the sole convicted principal in causing the violent\u00a0 death of Cornelio\u00a0 Alcansaren is evident and\u00a0 unquestionable.\u00a0\u00a0 His exculpatory allegations can in no manner weaken or destroy his own confession\u00a0 to having illtreated the\u00a0 man by giving him only two or three slaps, nor\u00a0 the\u00a0 testimony of various witnesses who saw the defendant punch the deceased, and, with\u00a0 his shoes on, kick him, nor the result\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 post-mortem examination of the body, on which signs of internal injuries were found on the neck, stomach,\u00a0 and lower abdomen.<br\/><br\/>Not the least proof is contained\u00a0 in the record that the injured man\u00a0 died in consequence of disease,\u00a0 and lacking proof to the contrary, it must be presumed that he was in good health on the morning of May 30, 1906, and inasmuch as it. appears from the record that\u00a0 after the ill treatment Alcansaren commenced to\u00a0 suffer pains in various parts of his body, that he could not drink water, swallow any food, urinate, nor much less work,\u00a0 and death\u00a0 came twenty-eight days thereafter, signs of internal injuries being discovered, it follows that\u00a0 Diaz,\u00a0 who illtreated him, is logically responsible for his death, because it has not been proven that Alcansaren lost his life by reason of causes other than the ill treatment that\u00a0 he received.<br\/><br\/>The defense, in order to prevent the prosecution and trial of the case,\u00a0 pleaded that\u00a0 the accused\u00a0 had already\u00a0 been placed in jeopardy, he having been tried,\u00a0 convicted, and sentenced\u00a0 to\u00a0 pay\u00a0 a fine of 50 pesetas\u00a0 and costs by the judgment\u00a0 rendered\u00a0 by\u00a0 the justice\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 peace of San Carlos in the action brought for maltreatment, and as <i>prima facie<\/i> evidence presented the record\u00a0 of the preliminary investigation, at the\u00a0 foot of which the proceedings had in said trial for misdemeanor appear.\u00a0\u00a0 (Folio 45.)<br\/><br\/>As the above plea\u00a0 was\u00a0 overruled,\u00a0 the defendant\u00a0 only offered as evidence at the trial a certified copy of the proceedings at the trial for misdemeanor, which appears attached to the record of the preliminary investigation at folios 36-40, forwarded by the aforesaid justice of the peace to the provincial fiscal of\u00a0 Occidental\u00a0 Negros in view of the fact that the defendant had committed the crime of homicide, and it was the duty of the latter official to have\u00a0 produced the same in the\u00a0 Court of First Instance upon the filing\u00a0 of his complaint for the said crime.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, the record of the preliminary investigation and\u00a0 the\u00a0 proceedings in the trial for misdemeanor were offered in the present case\u00a0 by the defense as evidence that the accused had already been in jeopardy, and subsequently, at the close of the trial, the defense again presented them as such evidence.\u00a0 In view of the repeated presentation of the record of said trial, it was not necessary for the provincial fiscal to offer the said proceedings for a third time as evidence for the prosecution, and he is entitled to avail himself of them to\u00a0 prove the crime and the guilt\u00a0 of the principal, inasmuch\u00a0 as it is a rule of law that a document presented in evidence by one party may likewise be used by the adverse party as evidence for his cause of action.<br\/><br\/>If in the opinion of the defense the copy\u00a0 of the proceedings at the trial prove his plea of jeopardy,\u00a0 and to that end he presented it, together with the proceedings in the preliminary investigation,\u00a0 the contents of both clearly prove the crime\u00a0 and the guilt of the accused. Still\u00a0 further,\u00a0 taking into account merely the result and the merits of the proceedings in the action for misdemeanor, one acquires the fullest conviction, beyond all peradventure of doubt, that Gabriel Diaz inflicted the ill treatment that occasioned the violent death of Cornelio Alcansaren.<br\/><br\/>A calm, careful, and impartial\u00a0 examination of the case discloses the helpless and abandoned condition in which the illtreated man was left in his house, without attendance by a physician or even a <i>curandero <\/i>up to the time of his\u00a0 death; the haste made by the justice of the peace of San Carlos to try the charge for misdemeanor; that of the author of the ill treatment in pleading guilty and complying with the sentence by paying the fine of P10 and costs imposed upon him; and, as the\u00a0 proceedings commenced', the\u00a0 reluctance\u00a0 of the witnesses, most of whom were laborers of the hacienda on which the defendant\u00a0 was employed, to appear and testify in the case, to\u00a0 the extent\u00a0 that at the request of the fiscal an order for the arrest of the witnesses for the prosecution had to be issued, and after being arrested they testified in\u00a0 a manner and\u00a0 in such terms that,\u00a0 as the Attorney-General states in his brief, lead one to presume that the first trial was fraudulently prepared by the\u00a0 accused.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding the fact that the action of the provincial fiscal has been obstructed in this case, in which he\u00a0 should have displayed more zeal in the performance of duties prescribed by the law, and that of the four witnesses offered in the Court of First Instance, Tomas\u00a0 Ferrer, a laborer from the hacienda of Sugbuncogon, said he did not know what was the cause of the death of the injured man, Estanislao Francisco did not remember anything that\u00a0 had occurred and denied\u00a0 having testified before the justice of the peace\u00a0 of San Carlos, although\u00a0 said\u00a0 official\u00a0 contradicted him and averred that the witness Estanislao testified under oath to the declaration that appears in the record of the preliminary investigation; yet, Matias Ferrer, an employee of said hacienda,\u00a0 affirmed\u00a0 that Cornelio died\u00a0 in consequence of the ill treatment he received thereat, although he did not know who inflicted it; and Santos Priano declared in\u00a0 turn\u00a0 that he testified in the preliminary investigation that the injured party had died in consequence of the maltreatment inflicted by Gabriel Diaz, and further stated that,\u00a0 with regard to the other points of\u00a0 his testimony, he\u00a0 heard them\u00a0 from.the deceased while living and from the latter's cousin, Fabian Aracan.\u00a0\u00a0 In spite of the behavior of the witnesses, the sum of this\u00a0 testimony does not favor the accused,\u00a0 but,\u00a0 on the contrary,\u00a0 supports the evidence presented in the proceedings had before the court of the justice of the peace.<br\/><br\/>The plea that the\u00a0 accused had already been\u00a0 placed\u00a0 in jeopardy\u00a0 when\u00a0 charged with and prosecuted for a misdemeanor before the justice of the peace\u00a0 of San Carlos and sentenced to pay a fine is not in accordance with the law, for the reason that the act he was charged with committing constituted\u00a0 a crime, and the said justice of the peace by whom he\u00a0 was improperly tried was incompetent and had no jurisdiction in the\u00a0 case.\u00a0\u00a0 (U.

Rep., 776.)<br\/><br\/>The Court of First Instance, when dismissing by its ruling of the 26th of September, 1906, the plea of jeopardy, rightly stated, among other reasons, that \"If it were lawful for a justice of the peace court to try cases of homicide, abuses and arbitrary conduct would then be matters of everday occurance, and in many cases crime would go unpunished, since I consider that in towns where the defendant is an influential resident, collusion would be very possible.<br\/><br\/>Apart from the impropriety of the ple of jeopardy, there appears the fact that, in alleging it, the representative of the defendant practically acknowledged and admitted the facts attributed to him and set out in the complaint as constituting the crime of homicide, the same that was charged by Maria Condeno, the victim's mother-in-law, before the justice of the peace who illegally qualified them as a misdemeanor. The defense has not even tried to show that the alleged facts were false noe has he endeavored to disprove them but, on the contrary, pleaded guilty to the charge of maltreatment.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding the rage and excessive cruelty with which, jusging from its fatal consequences, the maltreatment was carried out, it is yet possible to admit that the culprit did not intend to commit an evil so serious as the death of the person (circumstances 3, art.9, Penal Code), but the fact that the injured man failed to work one day in the hacienda because he had been confessed in anticipation of his marriage can not be considered as a cause determining loss of reason and self-control, the seventh circumstance os the said article, on the past of the accused whereby the penalty imposed by the law should be applied in its minimum degree.<br\/><br\/>For the reasons above set forth, in which the errors assigned to the trial court have been refuted, it is our opinion that the judgment appealed from should be reversed, and that Gabriel Dias should be sentenced, as we do hereby sentence hi,, to the penalty of\u00a0 fourteen years of rec<i>lusion temporal,<\/i> with the accessory penalties of article 59 of the Penal Code, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of P1,000, and to pay the costs of both instances, and it is so ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.J., Mapa, Johnson, Moreland,<\/i> and <i>Elliott, JJ.,<\/i> concur.<br\/><br\/><br\/><hr align=\"center\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><br\/><center><i><br\/>DISSENTING<\/i><br\/><\/center> <br\/><br\/><b>CARSON,<i> J.<\/i>, <\/b><br\/><br\/>I dissent.<br\/><br\/>In my opinion there is no competent evidence in the record upon which the findings of fact by the trial court should be sustained.<\/div>",

L, did, with violation of the Jaw, voluntarily,\u00a0 unlawfully and criminally, in a public place and in the presence of several persons, and with the intent to discredit, dishonor and expose to contempt Ramon Santos, the municipal president of the said\u00a0 municipality, utter the following words: <i>'Rayo de presidente, que quieres\u00a0 ser presidente para apoderarte de la propiedad de otros,'<\/i>\u00a0 (You are a queer sort of president, for\u00a0 you wish to be president in order to grab other people's\u00a0 property), which words are notoriously\u00a0 injurious, considering the position, dignity and circumstances of the person aggrieved.\"<\/blockquote>Other than this complaint,\u00a0 the record of the proceedings shows none to have been made by the alleged offended party.<br\/><br\/>The facts connected with\u00a0 the\u00a0 crime under prosecution are\u00a0 as follows: While Juan\u00a0 Flores was building a fence around the lot of Ramon Santos,\u00a0 the accused, who owned land adjoining the said lot, and a\u00a0 niece of hers, obstinately prevented him from\u00a0 continuing\u00a0 the work,\u00a0 and he then notified\u00a0 Ramon Santos of the trouble.\u00a0\u00a0 The latter then went to\u00a0 the place, and as Gabina de la Cruz, instead of acquiescing\u00a0 in his plea that they should\u00a0 not molest\u00a0 his workman and\u00a0 the suggestion that,\u00a0 if they felt that they were aggrieved, they\u00a0 should\u00a0 apply\u00a0 to\u00a0 the courts, created a\u00a0 disturbance\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 street,\u00a0 whereupon\u00a0 some policemen endeavored to take her to the presidencia, and it was then that Gabina de la\u00a0 Cruz uttered the alleged offensive words set forth in the complaint.<br\/><br\/>According to the principles underlying\u00a0 the\u00a0 Penal Code, there are two\u00a0 classes\u00a0 of insults: Those directed against private\u00a0 parties, which\u00a0 are purely private crimes and can not be prosecuted\u00a0 de oficio or\u00a0 on the initiative and through the\u00a0 public prosecutor,\u00a0 and those\u00a0 against the authorities, public officials or agents of the authorities, which are real public crimes that may be prosecuted\u00a0 <i>de oficio <\/i>and upon the initiative of the said public prosecutor.<br\/><br\/>This public crime of\u00a0 uttering insults against the authorities, public officials and agents of the authorities, in order to be such must have\u00a0 been committed while they were\u00a0 in the exercise of their functions or on the occasion thereof. (Arts.\u00a0 256, 257,\u00a0 Penal Code.)\u00a0\u00a0 Even\u00a0 though the\u00a0 insult was against the authorities, public\u00a0 official or agent of the authorities, if it was not\u00a0 committed while he was in the exercise or on the occasion of his official duties, it does not constitute a public crime.<br\/><br\/>The insult alleged in the complaint has nothing\u00a0 to\u00a0 do with the official duties of\u00a0 a municipal\u00a0 president.\u00a0\u00a0 The offended\u00a0 party was not\u00a0 at\u00a0 the time\u00a0 in\u00a0 the exercise of his functions as municipal president, nor was it on the occasion thereof that the accused\u00a0 uttered against him\u00a0 the words quoted\u00a0 in the\u00a0 complaint.\u00a0 It was on\u00a0 the occasion\u00a0 of the exercise of\u00a0 his apparent right of ownership\u00a0 with respect to what he understood\u00a0 to\u00a0 be the boundary\u00a0 line between his lot and\u00a0 that of his neighbor, Gabina de la\u00a0 Cruz, that the latter, vexed because they were forcing her away from the place of the dispute, gave rein\u00a0 to\u00a0 her tongue in that manner by\u00a0 making allusions to\u00a0 the\u00a0 office then held by the neighbor with whom\u00a0 she was disputing.\u00a0 But to\u00a0 allude to an office is\u00a0 not tantamount\u00a0 to showing disrespect to him who holds it while he is in the exercise of the same or on the occasion of the performance of his functions.<br\/><br\/>The present cause, then,\u00a0 has to do with an insult against a private party, although the offense may be considered as aggravated by the position\u00a0 of the offended person.<br\/><br\/>Act No. 1773 of the Philippine Commission has caused, since October 11, 1907, all\u00a0 crimes of injuria to be deemed public crimes, to be prosecuted in the same manner as all other public crimes (sec. 1); but the act contains\u00a0 a special proviso\u00a0 \"that no prosecution for the crimes of\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 or <i>injuria<\/i> committed against persons other than public officials or employees shall be\u00a0 instituted except upon the <i>complaint\"<\/i> (or <i>denuncia,<\/i> as interpreted by a majority of this court) \"of the aggrieved person.\"<br\/><br\/>This cause not having been instituted at the instance or upon the complaint of the aggrieved person, the prosecution is\u00a0 deemed to be entirely without foundation, and\u00a0 the\u00a0 proceedings had, contrary to the express prohibition of the law, are null and void.<br\/><br\/>This court\u00a0 can not\u00a0 consider\u00a0 the question\u00a0 whether the judgment appealed from is or is not just, when the\u00a0 entire process is radically null.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, we declare\u00a0 all the proceedings had to be null and void, and the complaint filed is dismissed.\u00a0\u00a0 No special finding is made as to the costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Johnson, Moreland,<\/i> and <i>Trent, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><\/div>",

The plaintiff alleges, and the fact is not denied, that he was appointed as administrator of the estate of the said Francisco Calzado. The record fails to show when he was appointed.<br\/><br\/>On the 31st of July, 1909, nearly six years after the death of the said Calzado, the plaintiff, as administrator, commenced the present action to recover the property described in paragraph 3 of the complaint. The defendant demurred to the complaint, alleging:<br\/><br\/>First. That the plaintiff was not the proper party to bring the action; and<br\/><br\/>Second. That the facts alleged were not sufficient to constitute a cause of action.<br\/><br\/>This demurrer was sustained and the plaintiff filed an amended petition. The amended petition did not change the character of the action. To the amended petition the defendant answered, denying generally and specifically all of the facts alleged in the complaint, and as a special defense alleged:<br\/><br\/>First. That at the time of the death of Francisco Calzado (the 9th of December, 1903), he was the owner of the property described in the complaint;<br\/><br\/>Second. That at the time of the death of Francisco Calzado he had no relatives, descendants or ascendants, but nephews, who being of lawful age divided among themselves the property in question and sold to the defendant the said property;<br\/><br\/>Third. That at the time of the division of the estate among the heirs of the deceased and at the time the lands were sold, there were no debts against the estate of the said Francisco Calzado;<br\/><br\/>Fourth. That the plaintiff is not a creditor of the estate of the said deceased.<br\/><br\/>During the trial of the cause the defendant showed by oral and documentary proof that he was in possession of the land in question; that he had purchased the same from some of the nephews and heirs of the deceased Francisco Calzado; that he had purchased the interest of all the heirs except perhaps three. There was no proof adduced during the trial of the cause to show that any of the heirs of the deceased were minors or that there were any debts existing against the said estate.<br\/><br\/>Under the provisions of the Civil Code (arts. 657 to 661), the rights to the succession of a person are transmitted from the moment of his death; in other words, the heirs succeeded immediately to all of the property of the deceased ancestor. The property belongs to the heirs at the moment of the death of the ancestor as completely as if the ancestor had executed and delivered to them a deed for the same before his death.\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of debts existing against the estate, the heirs may enter upon the administration of the said property immediately.\u00a0\u00a0 If they desire to administer it jointly, they may do so.\u00a0\u00a0 If they desire to partition it among themselves and can do this by mutual agreement, they also have that privilege.\u00a0\u00a0 The Code of Procedure in Civil Actions provides how an estate may be divided by a petition for partition in case they can not mutually agree in the division.\u00a0\u00a0 When there are no debts existing against the estate, there is certainly no occasion for the intervention of an administrator in the settlement and partition of the estate among the heirs.\u00a0\u00a0 When the heirs are all of lawful age and there.are no debts, there is no reason why the estate should be burdened with the costs and expenses of an administrator.\u00a0\u00a0 The property belonging absolutely to the heirs, in the absence of existing debts against the estate, the administrator has no right to intervene in any way whatever in the division of the estate among the heirs.\u00a0\u00a0 They are coowners of an undivided estate and the law offers them a remedy for the division of the same among themselves.\u00a0\u00a0 There is nothing in the present case to show that the heirs requested the appointment of the administrator, or that they intervened in any way whatever in the present action.\u00a0\u00a0 If there are any heirs of the estate who have not received their participation, they have their remedy by petition for partition of the said estate.<br\/><br\/>The lower court rendered a judgment.in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant.

Do\u00a0 you mean to say that she was lost? - A. I don't know the reason.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Will you repeat here what he stated to you in his letter? - A. He said that he begged me as a favor to\u00a0 ascertain the whereabouts of\u00a0 his wife.<br\/><br\/>\"This man - the\u00a0 trial\u00a0 judge\u00a0 says - whose declaration is not at all reasonable, showed by his manner when testifying, by his embarrassment and confusion, that he was not declaring\u00a0 the\u00a0 truth, but was simply repeating what he was taught to say.\"<\/blockquote>In order to prove\u00a0 that the second marriage was lawfully contracted, the accused ought to have shown,\u00a0 according to section 3\u00a0 of\u00a0 General Orders,\u00a0 No. 68, that his first wife had been absent for seven consecutive years up to the time he was married a second time, without\u00a0 his knowing that she was living, or that she was generally believed to be dead, as he also believed,\u00a0 at the time\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 second marriage. The record, however, does not contain the least evidence as to the general belief of the death of his first wife, or of the reason for his personal belief with respect to the dissolution, for such\u00a0 reason, of the first matrimonial bond by\u00a0 which he was united to said woman.<br\/><br\/>The witness\u00a0 Florentino Natividad saw\u00a0 Lorenza\u00a0 de los Santos continuously from\u00a0 the year 1904, when he was introduced\u00a0 to her by\u00a0 her\u00a0 husband, the\u00a0 accused,\u00a0 and also during the following years until 1908, when the accused was arrested.<br\/><br\/>In\u00a0 this\u00a0 instance the defense assigned\u00a0 as\u00a0 error\u00a0 in\u00a0 the judgment the fact that article 471, instead of article 440 of the Penal Code, was applied.<br\/><br\/>Article 440 is one\u00a0 of those in chapter\u00a0 3, title 9 of book 2 of the Penal Code, under the heading of \"Crimes of public scandal.\"\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 defense pretends that the crime should be classified as of public scandal, and not as\u00a0 illegal marriage. The said article 440 reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"He who, being united\u00a0 by an indissoluble religious marriage,\u00a0 should abandon his spouse and contract a new marriage with another person, or vice versa,\u00a0 even\u00a0 though the latter should not be indissoluble, shall incur the penalty of <i>arresto mayor<\/i> in its maximum degree to <i>prision correccional<\/i> in its minimum degree and public censure.\"<\/blockquote>In order to understand how, prior to the promulgation of General Orders, No.\u00a0 68, cited\u00a0 above, the\u00a0 crime of\u00a0 public scandal, punished by article 440, differed from that of illegal marriage, defined by article 471, the historical antecedents of the provision of law should be recalled; it was\u00a0 a new one in the\u00a0 Penal\u00a0 Code of Spain\u00a0 of\u00a0 1870, as it was not contained in the code of 1850, and was modified when transferred to the Penal Code of the Philippines.<br\/><br\/>In Spain, prior to the passage of the law of the 18th of June, 1870, no marriage other than the religious or canonical was recognized as producing juridical and civil effects. Since the enactment of the code, civil marriage was established, and it was the only one producing civil effects.\u00a0 In the judgment of the lawmaker it seemed just that a punishment should be established for \"he who, being united by an indissoluble\u00a0 canonical marriage, should abandon his spouse and contract a new marriage\u00a0 according to the civil law with another person,\u00a0 or vice versa, even though the\u00a0 religious marriage that he should\u00a0 newly contract were not indissoluble.\"<br\/><br\/>When the Penal Code was promulgated in the Philippines, no marriage other than the religious or canonical was recognized as producing juridical and\u00a0 civil effects.\u00a0 Of\u00a0 the law of the 18th of June, 1870, only chapter 5 on the general effects of marriage, but not the civil marriage itself, which was the main object thereof, was applied to the Philippines. There was therefore no reason to insert in the Penal Code for the\u00a0 Philippines an\u00a0 article similar to that inserted in the code\u00a0 of Spain, in the\u00a0 revision of 1870, a revision brought about through the efforts of the same cabinet minister who countersigned the amendment of June 18, 1870, on the civil marriage.<br\/><br\/>It may therefore be said that, in the Philippines, there did not exist\u00a0 the same\u00a0 reason that existed in\u00a0 Spain\u00a0 to establish a penalty for an act classified\u00a0 merely\u00a0 as public scandal, as applied to\u00a0 a person who, being married canonically, should again marry civilly, or vice versa,\u00a0 inasmuch as, during the\u00a0 former sovereignty, it was\u00a0 not possible\u00a0 to contract marriage except in the religious or canonical form, which was the only one acknowledged and\u00a0 authorized\u00a0 by the law; and while several forms of marriage are recognized under the present\u00a0 sovereignty, civil effects\u00a0 are produced by all of them.\u00a0 So\u00a0 that neither at the present time is there any reason for the punishment of a crime having merely\u00a0 the character of a public\u00a0 scandal, in so\u00a0 far as it does not interfere with the \/status of the family, or with family rights, for the reason that only one of the marriages could have produced any legal effect, according to said law of the 18th of June, 1870.\u00a0\u00a0 Now, as well as formerly, whoever marries in the Philippines without his or her previous marriage having been\u00a0 dissolved, interferes with the status and the family rights created by the first one,\u00a0 and can not be punished otherwise\u00a0 than for bigamy upon contracting a second marriage.<br\/><br\/>Inasmuch as the\u00a0 judgment appealed\u00a0 from is in accordance with the law and\u00a0 the merits of the case,\u00a0 it is\u00a0 hereby affirmed with the costs of this instance against the appellant, and\u00a0 it is\u00a0 so ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson,<\/i>\u00a0 and <i>Moreland, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><\/div>",

This\u00a0 document of sale was duly registered on September 29,1900.\u00a0\u00a0 On\u00a0 May 5, 1908, Manuel Giner sold this property, including the\u00a0 land\u00a0 in\u00a0 question, to the\u00a0 plaintiff company. This document of purchase and sale was likewise registered in the propertyregiatry on August 11, 1908.<br\/><br\/>On March 13, 1885, one Marcelp Corteza commenced an action in the\u00a0 Courtof First Instance of the\u00a0 Province of Occidental Negros against the said Tomas\u00a0 R. de\u00a0 Leon to recover the sum of f&amp;17$i with interest, due upon a promissory note.\u00a0 By reason\u00a0 of the commencement of this action an order of attachment was issued on March 20, 1885,\u00a0 out of the said Court of First\u00a0 Instance and levied upon\u00a0 the one hundred hectares of the above-described hacienda.<br\/><br\/>Final judgment was entered on June 28,1889, against the said Tomas R. de Leon and in favor of the plaintiff in that case for the sum\u00a0 of P2,175,\u00a0 with interest and costs.\u00a0 This judgment has never been completely satisfied.\u00a0 On May 25, 19P7, Jose Felix Martinez purchased from the said Corteza all of his interest in the said\u00a0 judgment against the said De Leon.\u00a0 On petition of the\u00a0 said Martinez the Court\u00a0 of First Instance, on the 24th of July, 1908,'issued an execution against the said De\u00a0 Leon, directing\u00a0 the sheriff to satisfy the original judgment out of the property of the judgment debtor, De Leon.\u00a0 The sheriff,\u00a0 by virtue of the said execution, took possession on August 31, 1908, of the one hundred hectares of land which forms a part of the said hacienda, and which was attached on March 20, 1885, and proceeded to advertise the same for sale to satisfy the said judgment against De Leon.\u00a0 The\u00a0 plaintiff company served written notice upon the\u00a0 sheriff, claiming to\u00a0 be the\u00a0 owner of the said one hundred hectares.\u00a0 The judgment creditor, being the assignee of Marcelo Corteza, having filed an indemnity bond, the sheriff proceeded to sell at public auction sixty\u00a0 of the one\u00a0 hundred hectares for\u00a0 the\u00a0 sum of P2,632.07,\u00a0 and Ricardo\u00a0 Nolan being the highest bidder\u00a0 became the purchaser.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff company thereupon commenced, on the 19th of September,\u00a0 1908, this\u00a0 action in the Court of First Instance of the Province of Occidental Negros against Jose Felix Martinez, the sheriff of Occidental Negros, and Ricardo Nolan, to recover the said sixty hectares which were sold\u00a0 at public auction.\u00a0 Judgment was rendered on July 3, 1909, by the court below,\u00a0 dismissing this action with\u00a0 costs.\u00a0 The plaintiff\u00a0 appealed.<br\/><br\/>The last\u00a0 action which was\u00a0 taken during the\u00a0 Spanish regime by the judgment creditor, Corteza, seeking to have the judgment satisfied was in 1897.\u00a0 The next move which he made was in 1903, when he^presented a petition to the Court\u00a0 of First Instance asking that the registrar of deeds be ordered to certify\u00a0 to the Court of First Instance what mortgages, liens, etc., if any, appeared in his books against the one hundred hectares which had\u00a0 been\u00a0 attached.\u00a0 This petition\u00a0 was granted.\u00a0 No other action was taken\u00a0 until 1907, when Martinez,\u00a0 as assignee of Corteza, asked (on the 12th day of July)\u00a0 that the\u00a0 court\u00a0 direct an execution to issue\u00a0 against the property of\u00a0 the judgment debtor.\u00a0 The said judgment debtor appeared and interposed a demurrer on the ground that the\u00a0 action had prescribed\u00a0 (this petition being treated as a motion and not as a new action).\u00a0\u00a0 This objection of the\u00a0 judgment\u00a0 debtor\u00a0 was overruled and the execution\u00a0 issued, but\u00a0 not\u00a0 against any\u00a0 special property. Under this execution it appears that certain properties were levied upon and sold but the sale was later annulled.\u00a0 Other executions were issued\u00a0 on the 30th of April\u00a0 and the\u00a0 24th of July, 1908; and, as we have said, under this last execution the land sought to be recovered was sold at public auction.<br\/><br\/>The question to\u00a0 be determined\u00a0 is whether or not this judgment could be enforced in the\u00a0 manner above set forth in view\u00a0 of the fact that it was rendered\u00a0 and became\u00a0 final in\u00a0 1889.\u00a0 On this\u00a0 point\u00a0 we\u00a0 think\u00a0 the provisions of\u00a0 the Code of Civil\u00a0 Procedure\u00a0 are applicable.\u00a0\u00a0 This code\u00a0 took effect on the 1st\u00a0 day of October, 1901, and the execution, by virtue of which the sixty hectares in question were sold, was issued on the 24th\u00a0 of July, 1908; that is, a little over six years and nine months\u00a0 after the\u00a0 said code went into effect.\u00a0\u00a0 Said execution was\u00a0 issued to carry into\u00a0 effect\u00a0 the original\u00a0 judgment without\u00a0 a new\u00a0 action\u00a0\u00a0 having\u00a0 been instituted, tried, and\u00a0 determined. <br\/><br\/>Sections 443 and 447 of the Code of Civil Procedure are as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"SEC.\u00a0 443.<i> When\u00a0 execution may issue.<\/i> - The\u00a0 party\u00a0 in whose favor judgment\u00a0 is given may,\u00a0 at\u00a0 any time within five years after the entry thereof, have a writ of execution issued for its enforcement, as hereinafter\u00a0 provided.<br\/><br\/>\"SEC.\u00a0 447. <i>Enforcement of judgment after lapse of five years. <\/i>- In all cases, a judgment may be enforced after the lapse of\u00a0 five years from the date of its entry, and before the same shall have been barred by any\u00a0 statute of limitation, by an action instituted\u00a0 in regular form, by\u00a0 complaint, as other actions are instituted.\"<\/blockquote>It is urged by the appellees that the Court of First Instance decided in 1907 that the judgment had not prescribed and that as no appeal was taken from that\u00a0 decision it must be considered as final.\u00a0 On examination of this record it appears that the court below, in passing upon the judgment debtor's objection to the issuance of an execution,\u00a0 did hold that the judgment had not prescribed.\u00a0 This decision was based upon the motion of the judgment creditor, dated the 12th of July of that year, wherein he asked for an execution, the said judgment being dated the\u00a0 17th of October of the same year.<br\/><br\/>If it be held that section\u00a0 443 of\u00a0 the Code of Civil Procedure,<i> supra<\/i>,\u00a0 is applicable\u00a0 to\u00a0 the case\u00a0 at bar,\u00a0 for the reason that more than five years had transpired from the date this section became operative\u00a0 until the 12th\u00a0 of July, 1907, the date of the presentation of the motion\u00a0 upon which the judgment was based, then that decision would be null and void, inasmuch\u00a0 as it sought\u00a0 to\u00a0 enforce\u00a0 a judgment which had prescribed by statute.<br\/><br\/>If the original judgment had been entered the next day after the Code of Civil Procedure went\u00a0 into\u00a0 effect, and if the\u00a0 statute of limitations had not been interrupted,\u00a0 then it is clear 'that the said judgment could not have been enforced in this manner after the expiration of five years, but it could: have\u00a0 been revived under the provisions of section 447 of the Code of Civil Procedure,<i> supra.<\/i>\u00a0 This being true, we see no reason why the\u00a0 provisions of section 443 should not apply to judgments rendered prior to\u00a0 the\u00a0 passage\u00a0 of the Code of Civil Procedure, provided\u00a0 the full\u00a0 five years had\u00a0 expired after\u00a0 its\u00a0 passage before\u00a0 the\u00a0 judgment\u00a0 was made effective, as in the case at bar.\u00a0 This holding is not in conflict with the provisions of section\u00a0 38 of the said code, wherein it is stated that - <br\/><blockquote><i>\"Provided, nevertheless, <\/i> That all rights of action which have already accrued\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 must be vindicated by the commencement of an action or proceeding to enforce the same within ten years after this Act comes into effect.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>This\u00a0 provision applies\u00a0 to rights\u00a0 of\u00a0 action'\u00a0 and not\u00a0 to judgments.\u00a0 The general rule for the construction\u00a0 of statutes relating to prescription is that such\u00a0 statutes apply to all cases\u00a0 alike.\u00a0\u00a0 The legislature having this in mind enacted this section 38 as a saving clause to protect rights of action which\u00a0 had accrued before the passage\u00a0 of this law.\u00a0 No saving clause was made with reference to judgments.\u00a0\u00a0 So it is clear that it was the intention of the Commission that section 443 apply to judgments\u00a0 which had\u00a0 been entered before the passage of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br\/><br\/>The court below, in passing upon the judgment creditor's motion, dated the 12th of July, 1007, held that the\u00a0 action taken\u00a0 by the\u00a0 said judgment creditor in\u00a0 1903 operated to interrupt the\u00a0 five-year statute of limitations.<br\/><br\/>As we have said, the action taken by the judgment creditor in 1903 consisted only of a petition dated the 24th of January,\u00a0 1903, directed to the court, asking the court to order the registrar of deeds to certify to the said court what mortgages, or liens, if\u00a0 any, appeared in his books against the property of the judgment debtor heretofore attached. The court granted this\u00a0 request on the 23d of March of the same year and\u00a0 no action\u00a0 whatever\u00a0 was taken thereafter in the matter until the 12th of July, 1907.\u00a0 The presentation of that petition,\u00a0 asking the court to direct the registrar of deeds to furnish that information, and the\u00a0 granting of said petition,\u00a0 can not be\u00a0 held to have had the effect of interrupting the provisions of said section 443.\u00a0 This section is\u00a0 positive\u00a0 in its terms, and provisions are\u00a0 made in section\u00a0 447 for the revival of a judgment which has prescribed.\u00a0 Five years was considered\u00a0 a sufficient length of time for\u00a0 a judgment creditor to enforce his\u00a0 judgment. There is nothing in section 443 to the effect that any action taken by the judgment creditor shall\u00a0 operate to extend the five-year period.<br\/><br\/>In the case\u00a0 of\u00a0 Buell <i>vs.<\/i>\u00a0 Buell\u00a0 (92 Cal., 393), judgment was entered in favor of the appellant on\u00a0 the 28th of February,\u00a0 1877.\u00a0\u00a0 Execution on this\u00a0 judgment was stayed by various orders of the\u00a0 court, made at\u00a0 the\u00a0 request of the appellee, until January, 1878.\u00a0 On\u00a0 the 17th\u00a0 of January, 1878,\u00a0 the appellee commenced an action against the appellant to obtain an injunction\u00a0 restraining the appellant from taking out an execution on or enforcing the collection of his judgment.\u00a0 An injunction was issued and remained in full force until the 10th of December, 1885, when it was dissolved\u00a0 by a decree of the court.\u00a0 On the 30th of September, 1885, the appellant applied to the court for an order directing\u00a0 the clerk\u00a0 to issue\u00a0 an execution on his judgment. This request was granted and an execution issued and placed in the hands\u00a0 of the proper officer, but was\u00a0 subsequently returned\u00a0 wholly unsatisfied.\u00a0 On the\u00a0 16th of September 1889, the\u00a0 appellant made another application for an execution which was granted and\u00a0 placed in the hands\u00a0 of the sheriff, with instructions to levy upon the property of the appellee.\u00a0 This last writ of execution\u00a0 was recalled\u00a0 by the court and an\u00a0 appeal was taken from\u00a0 this order recalling the said execution.\u00a0\u00a0 The Supreme Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Belcher, said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The question, then, is, did\u00a0 the\u00a0 court have jurisdiction and authority to make the\u00a0 order for\u00a0 the issuance\u00a0 of the writ?\u00a0 Section 681\u00a0 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides: 'The party in whose favor judgment is\u00a0 given may at any time within five years after the entry thereof have\u00a0 a writ of execution issued\u00a0 for its enforcement.'\u00a0 And it has been held that when the\u00a0 judgment is for the recovery of money, execution\u00a0 can only be issued\u00a0 thereon within five years after its entry.<br\/><br\/>\"It is claimed by appellant\u00a0 that the time during which execution\u00a0 was stayed should\u00a0 be excluded from the computation of the five years.\u00a0 But this claim can not be sustained, the contrary rule having been expressly declared by this court (Solomon <i>vs.<\/i> Maguire, 29\u00a0 Cal., 237;\u00a0 Cortez<i> vs<\/i>.

Urrutia &amp; Co. filed suit in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila against The Pasig Steamer and Lighter Company,\u00a0 alleging, among other particulars, that it is the owner of the steamer called <i> Nuestra Senora del Pilar<\/i>, registered in the port of Manila, provided\u00a0 with\u00a0 the proper licenses to\u00a0 navigate and do business in the\u00a0 waters of the\u00a0 Philippines, its cash value being P80,000, the cargo it carried, on\u00a0 the dates referred to in the claim,\u00a0 being\u00a0 P45,000; that the defendant\u00a0 is the owner of the steamer San Juan, registered at\u00a0 the port of Manila; that on or about the 6th of December,\u00a0 1908, while a storm was raging, the said steamer <i>Nuestra Senora del Pilar<\/i> was proceeding toward the port of Legaspi, and twenty hours and thirty minutes after departure\u00a0 of the vessel a steamship displaying signal flags was sighted in the direction of Malabrigo, on which account the former ship steered toward the latter and it was seen that it was the San Juan, and the signals were \"M. Y.\" - I am disabled, can not navigate.\u00a0\u00a0 Will you tow me?\u00a0\u00a0 \"E. L. D.\" - Secure anchorage.<br\/><br\/>That thereupon the steamer\u00a0 <i>Nuestra Senora\u00a0 del Pilar,<\/i> with great risk to the vessel, salved the San Juan and took her to a safe port, and that had it not been for the timely, prompt, and efficacious help rendered by the <i>Nuestra Senora del Pilar, <\/i>the San Juan and her cargo would have been totally lost; that the steamer salved had at the date of the salvage an actual and cash value of P100,000,, wherefore the just and adequate remuneration for the salvage service rendered by\u00a0 plaintiff's\u00a0 steamer amounted to the sum of P40,000, the payment of which having been demanded of the defendant since the 15th of January, 1909, the said defendant,\u00a0 without objecting to the amount of the claim for the said service, does not pay the same\u00a0 and has been delaying payment under flimsy pretexts, and therefore the plaintiff prays the court to render judgment in its favor for the sum of\u00a0 P40,000, with legal interest\u00a0 thereon from the 15th of January, 1909, and the costs.<br\/><br\/>The defendant, being summoned to appear,\u00a0 filed a demurrer to the original complaint, alleging that the facts therein set\u00a0 forth did not\u00a0 constitute a cause of action\u00a0 against the defendant and that there was a defect of plaintiff parties.<br\/><br\/>On the 30th of June\u00a0 following the plaintiff presented a motion praying\u00a0 that the' aforesaid\u00a0 demurrer be\u00a0 overruled and summons\u00a0 issued to the\u00a0 defendant; the court, by order of July 3, 1909, sustained the demurrer and declared that the plaintiff was entitled to amend the complaint by including therein the\u00a0 officers\u00a0 and crew of its ship as defendant parties, if they did not wish to be made plaintiffs.\u00a0 Against this decision the attorneys for the plaintiff took\u00a0 exception and by a writing of the 8th of the following July stated to the court that, in conformity with article 101 of the Code of Civil Procedure, they chose not\u00a0 to amend their client's complaint by making the captain and officers\u00a0 of the said steamer parties\u00a0 thereto.<br\/><br\/>In view\u00a0 thereof, the\u00a0 court, by order of the same date, July 8, dismissed the complaint for the reasons it set forth, with the costs against the plaintiff.\u00a0 To this decision the latter excepted and announced their intention to file a bill of exceptions in the ordinary manner; this\u00a0 when filed was certified, approved, and forwarded to the clerk of this court.<br\/><br\/>The shipping firm owning the steamer <i>Nuestra Senora del Pilar <\/i>seeks to obtain compensation from\u00a0 the owners of the steamer\u00a0 San Juan for salvage services rendered\u00a0 by the former\u00a0 to the latter during\u00a0 a\u00a0 storm. The services were successfully rendered, at the request of the officers\u00a0 of the ship salved, which was conducted by the <i>Nuestra Senora del Pilar <\/i>to a safe port, and the compensation is not refused by the owners of the <i>San Juan<\/i>.\u00a0 The matter at issue, which is the\u00a0 subject of the appeal, is\u00a0 restricted to the question whether the company owning the Nuestra Senora del Pilar is compelled, in order to claim the\u00a0 said compensation, to make the officers\u00a0 and\u00a0 crew of the\u00a0 salving ship, <i>Nuestra Senora\u00a0 del Pilar,<\/i> parties\u00a0 plaintiff or defendant, as was decided affirmatively by the Court of First Instance.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding the fact that the case is not expressly provided for in the\u00a0 legislation in force\u00a0 in these Islands, especially in\u00a0 the\u00a0 Code of Commerce, inasmuch as\u00a0 it is a question\u00a0 of\u00a0 such\u00a0 an important service and of just compensation therefor, wherein the subjects\u00a0 of\u00a0 any\u00a0 nation might be interested to such\u00a0 an extent that the questions arising out of salvage services might become international, under the principles of the common law, it is proper for this\u00a0 court to determine the question pending\u00a0 between the parties in accordance with the laws of the United\u00a0 States and the decisions of the courts of the same.<br\/><blockquote>\"Salvage is awarded\u00a0 to encourage promptness, energy, efficiency, and heroic endeavor in saving\u00a0 life and\u00a0 property in peril\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\"\u00a0 (Vol.\u00a0 24, Am.\u00a0 &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, p. 1222.)<br\/><br\/>\"The\u00a0 owner of the salving vessel\u00a0 has\u00a0 always been considered\u00a0 as entitled to salvage reward for\u00a0 the use\u00a0 of his vessel in\u00a0 rendering salvage services, though\u00a0 he\u00a0 was not present\u00a0 when the\u00a0 salvage service was rendered.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Idem, p. 1195.)<\/blockquote>The action and cooperation of the officers\u00a0 and crew of the\u00a0 salving vessel\u00a0 was\u00a0 meritorious and\u00a0 worthy\u00a0 of\u00a0 all praise, yet the use and service of the vessel, as an indispensable instrument for\u00a0 the salvage, was of the utmost importance, taking into consideration the danger to which the ship and the crew were exposed; therefore the latter and\u00a0 the owner of the\u00a0 salving\u00a0 vessel are\u00a0 unquestionably entitled to the remuneration which they have\u00a0 earned.<br\/><br\/>It sometimes happens that not all the\u00a0 officers and members of the crew remain\u00a0 in the service of\u00a0 the shipowner, but that, after rendering\u00a0 the salvage services, they depart for other distant countries, and it is difficult to reunite them or to rely upon the acquiescence of the absent ones; it is not right that\u00a0 the\u00a0 shipowner\u00a0 should be\u00a0 prevented by\u00a0 this circumstance\u00a0 from availing\u00a0 himself of his\u00a0 right to claim so just\u00a0 a\u00a0 remuneration before the courts,\u00a0 when\u00a0 he\u00a0 whose obligation it is to pay it refuses to do so extra]udicially or does not heed the efforts of the creditor to obtain compensation, notwithstanding the justice of his claim.<br\/><br\/>Granting that the officers and members of the crew were entitled to\u00a0 a certain part of the remuneration, if the owner of the salving vessel makes claim for proper compensation in the courts, the theory\u00a0 and jurisprudence of\u00a0 the\u00a0 courts of the United\u00a0 States in North America do not compel him to make the said officers and crew parties to\u00a0 the suit, nor do they prescribe\u00a0 the dismissal\u00a0 of the shipowner's action, but they permit him to continue the suit without prejudice to any rights\u00a0 the\u00a0 former may have to a part of\u00a0 the said remuneration which is allotted proportionately in the discretion of the court.<br\/><br\/>For want of an express law in\u00a0 these Islands governing the matter, and since this court is obliged to decide the present litigation in accordance\u00a0 with the jurisprudence of the courts\u00a0 of the United States,\u00a0 we cite the following pertinent extracts\u00a0 from two\u00a0 decisions of\u00a0 the United States Supreme Court.<br\/><br\/>Justice\u00a0 Clifford,\u00a0 of the Supreme Court\u00a0 of the\u00a0 United States, who wrote the opinion in the case of The Blackwall (10 Wall. (U. S.), 1,12, 13), says:<br\/><blockquote>\"Salvors are not\u00a0 deprived\u00a0 of a remedy because another set of salvors neglect or refuse to join in the suit, nor will such neglect or refusal benefit the Hbelants by giving them any claim to a larger compensation, as the non-prosecution by one set of salvors inures, not to the libelants prosecuting the claim, but to the owners of the property saved.<br\/><br\/>\"Cases may also be found where co-salvors who neglected to appear and become parties to the suit until the decree was pronounced were allowed to petition the court for such compensation out of the fund in the registry of the court, and where their claim received a favorable adjudication.<br\/><br\/>\"Objection is also made that the\u00a0 owners of a vessel can not promote a salvage suit unless they participate in the salvage service; or\u00a0 if they may promote such a\u00a0 suit, that they can not participate in\u00a0 the reward\u00a0 decreed for the salvage service except for the risk and damage to\u00a0 which their property was exposed in rendering the salvage service. Such an objection was made in the\u00a0 case of <i>The Camanche,<\/i> before cited, but the court overruled the objection, and that ruling is adopted and applied\u00a0 in this case.\"<\/blockquote>The same Justice Clifford,\u00a0 who delivered the opinion in the case of <i>The Camanche<\/i>\u00a0 (8 Wall. (U. S.), 448, 474,\u00a0 and 476), among other things also says:<br\/><blockquote>\"Remuneration for salvage service is\u00a0 awarded to the owners of vessels, not because they are present, or supposed to be present when\u00a0 the service is rendered, but on account of the danger to which the service\u00a0 exposes their property and the risk which they run of loss in suffering their vessels to engage in such perilous undertaking;\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>\"Next proposition of the claimants is that the libelants, even if they may be regarded as salvors, were not the sole salvors, and consequently that the decree of the circuit court ought not to be affirmed, as it would not be a bar to a subsequent suit for\u00a0 the same services if instituted by their employees.<br\/><br\/>\"All persons interested may appear, on the return of the monition, and become parties to the suit, or, by some proper proceeding,\u00a0 have their rights adjudicated; and\u00a0 in many cases, even after the decree upon the merits is pronounced, they may appear at any time before the fund is distributed and claim any\u00a0 interest they may have\u00a0 in the proceeds of the property libeled,\u00a0 if any, in the registry of the court, *\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*.\"<\/blockquote>Considering\u00a0 the\u00a0 doctrine established by the\u00a0 decisions quoted, and\u00a0 in\u00a0 view of the fact that the plaintiff firm has chosen not to make the\u00a0 captain, officers, and\u00a0 crew of the steamer Nuestra Senora del Pilar parties in its claim,\u00a0 this court decrees that the trial shall continue\u00a0 in all due form, without prejudice to the said officers and\u00a0 crew exercising the rights that pertain to them, whenever they may deem proper.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, and following the procedure observed in\u00a0 the United States, it is in\u00a0 our opinion\u00a0 proper to reverse, and we hereby reverse, the order of dismissal of the 8th of July, together with the previous order sustaining the demurrer, and\u00a0 the judge of\u00a0 first\u00a0 instance, to whom this decision shall be communicated, shall proceed\u00a0 with the present litigation in accordance with law.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

the defendants were further accused of afterwards having presented the said false document at the trial, knowingly and with intent of gain.\u00a0\u00a0 This cause having come to trial, the court, after considering the evidence adduced, rendered judgment on\u00a0 April 20, 1909, acquitting Rufino Beltran, with\u00a0 one-half of the costs <i>de oficio<\/i>, and sentenced Tan Chian, for the falsification of a private document, to the penalty of one year\u00a0 eight months and twenty-one days' <i>presidio correccional<\/i>, and in case of\u00a0 insolvency,\u00a0 to the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment, to pay one-half of the costs, and to the\u00a0 other accessory penalties.\u00a0\u00a0 From this\u00a0 judgment\u00a0 the defendant appealed.<br\/><br\/>From the facts hereinbefore related,\u00a0 which were\u00a0 duly proved in the present cause, it is found that\u00a0 the crime of falsification was in fact committed\u00a0 with respect to a\u00a0 document of a private character, provided for and punished by article\u00a0 304, in connection with article 300, of the Penal Code; the first-named article is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"He\u00a0 who, to\u00a0 the prejudice of a third person\u00a0 or with intent of causing it, shall, in a private document, commit any of the falsifications specified in\u00a0 article 300,\u00a0 shall be punished with the penalties of <i>presidio correccional<\/i> in its minimum and medium degrees and a\u00a0 fine of from 625 to 6,250 pesetas.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The following facts were fully proven at\u00a0 the trial:\u00a0 The Chinaman Liao Gui, the manager of the said firm of Kim Hoc Hen,\u00a0 sent, through another Chinaman, Chua\u00a0 Ungco, the memorandum, Exhibit A, of the\u00a0 account, showing a debit balance of P288.35, to the Chinaman Tan\u00a0 Chian;\u00a0 this account was made out by the bookkeeper of the firm, Vicente Jorge Guan Muaco, from the entries recorded in the ledger, fi'om which was torn out and attached to page 150 of the trial record the leaf which was presented as Exhibit B, in which the said sum appears as a balance owed by the defendant\u00a0 to\u00a0 the said firm.\u00a0\u00a0 The bearer of the\u00a0 note or memorandum, Exhibit A, personally went to Guinlajon, a barrio of Sorsogon, to deliver it to the debtor who, after taking cognizance thereof, stated to Chua Ungco\u00a0 that on account of the poor business\u00a0 which he\u00a0 was doing he could not pay the whole debt, but that he would do\u00a0 so in small monthly payments.\u00a0 This\u00a0 memorandum, which was\u00a0 left with the accused, had been transmitted to him at\u00a0 the\u00a0 end of the said month in order that he might be informed, according to the custom observed\u00a0 by the Chinese in their mercantile relations,\u00a0 that\u00a0 there\u00a0 was\u00a0 an\u00a0 unpaid\u00a0 balance charged against him in account.\u00a0 However,\u00a0 notwithstand- ing the\u00a0 demands made upon\u00a0 him, Tan Chian did not pay the whole nor any part of the said sum of P288.35, and thereupon the legal\u00a0 representative of\u00a0 the manager, Liao Gui, filed suit against him in the justice of the peace court of Sorsogon, and\u00a0 the defendant in his\u00a0 answer to the complaint denied all the facts\u00a0 alleged by\u00a0 the plaintiff and at the same time filed a counterclaim, alleging that the plaintiff was owing him P288.35, according to\u00a0 a settlement had between them on September 24,\u00a0 1908.\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, on the plaintiff's petition, the case was dismissed, with reservation of the right to institute such other action as might be proper. Tan Chian exhibited at the\u00a0 said trial, in answer to a subpoena <i>duces tecum,<\/i> the document marked \"Exhibit A,\" the same document or memorandum which was written by the bookkeeper, Vicente Guan Muaco, and which was delivered by its bearer, Chua Ungco, to the debtor,\u00a0 Tan Chian, in the latter Js\u00a0 store in Guinlajon.\u00a0 After the said\u00a0 document had been exhibited by the accused,\u00a0 alterations, changes, and the insertion of the signs, figures, and Chinese characters thereof were observed; these had been made in\u00a0 such manner that, in the\u00a0 place where before\u00a0 one read P1.39\u00a0 now\u00a0 appears P678.09,\u00a0 where before\u00a0 one read P288.35\u00a0 now\u00a0 appears P388.35, and where before appeared P289.74 one now reads P389.74;\u00a0 and if before one\u00a0 read\u00a0 expenditure,\u00a0 debit\u00a0 or balance owing, now one reads\u00a0 deposit or\u00a0 balance to credit, according to the testimony of the said bookkeeper\u00a0 who,\u00a0 on the paper Exhibit C graphically showed how by intercalating, amplifying, and superposing lines and signs in\u00a0 the Chinese, words, they may be converted into characters and words different from those previously written and of a different meaning.\u00a0\u00a0 The bearer\u00a0 of the said memorandum,\u00a0 Chua Ungco,\u00a0 affirmed\u00a0 that this document then contained words different from those which were previously written therein at the time that he\u00a0 conveyed and delivered it to the debtor.<br\/><br\/>From\u00a0 all the\u00a0 foregoing facts\u00a0 it\u00a0 is\u00a0 concluded that the document or memorandum, Exhibit A,\u00a0 was\u00a0 falsified\u00a0 by means\u00a0 of alterations,\u00a0 changes, and the insertions of characters and signs in such manner\u00a0 that its contents, instead of .showing a balance due by the accused Tan Chian, shows the latter to be a creditor of the\u00a0 firm which\u00a0 sent him the said memorandum for the purpose of informing him of his debt, so that he might pay the same, as was proper for him to do.<br\/><br\/>The defendant Tan Chian is the sole responsible perpetrator of this\u00a0 crime, by direct participation.\u00a0\u00a0 It\u00a0 is immaterial whether it was\u00a0 he or another who made the said alterations and changes in the document, inasmuch as the falsified\u00a0 memorandum remained in his control from the time that he received it from Chua Ungco, on\u00a0 August 29, to the first part of November, 1908, when\u00a0 he exhibited it on the occasion of his filing the counterclaim in the justice of the peace court,\u00a0 whereby he demanded payment of the amount which in\u00a0 appearance the said firm was owing him, and\u00a0 during which\u00a0 long\u00a0 interval of time\u00a0 he could have effected the falsification. Whereas the execution\u00a0 of the criminal act aforesaid could have been of benefit and profit to him alone, since from debtor that he was, he became the creditor, after the alterations and changes which were made in the said memorandum, which was received without them, it must undoubtedly\u00a0 be\u00a0 presumed, without any evidence to the contrary, that the\u00a0 accused Tan Chian was, notwithstanding his denial, the\u00a0 sole perpetrator of the crime of falsification herein\u00a0 prosecuted; and, even though\u00a0 it were another who made the alterations, changes, and insertions of the characters and figures in the document referred to, it is\u00a0 also to be presumed that\u00a0 such\u00a0 third person\u00a0 did so through inducement and. upon order of the defendant, for the very reason that the latter exhibited\u00a0 the said\u00a0 instrument afterwards at the trial to prove that he was a creditor for the amount therein expressed.<br\/><br\/>The penal law does not absolutely require that the falsification of a private document should have been detrimental to another; it is sufficient that the falsifier should have had the intention to cause such detriment to\u00a0 another person. In the present case it is evident that the defendant, in making alterations\u00a0 and changes\u00a0 in the said document, intended not only to elude the payment of his debt by defrauding his creditor, but also to effect his perverse\u00a0 purpose of having his creditor company pay to\u00a0 him the\u00a0 amount he actually owed the concern, by means of the falsification of the document expressive of his. debt.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the nature of this document, it is unquestionable that it is a private instrument and does not embody the conditions required to allow its being considered as of a mercantile character, and therefore falls within the provisions of the said article 304 of the Penal Code.<br\/><br\/>The defendant recognized the\u00a0 document, Exhibit A, as being the same that he received from the manager, Liao Gui, although he\u00a0 denied having made alterations and changes therein, stating that he did not know how to write.\u00a0 Such allegations, for lack of proof, can not be considered as true and are, on the one hand, unlikely in themselves, and on the other,\u00a0 devoid of reasonable grounds for\u00a0 belief, for it was proved at the trial that by the alterations and changes made in the said\u00a0 document the defendant\u00a0 is made to appear therein as converted from a debtor to a creditor of the firm whose manager by means of the said document demanded of him the payment of his debt.\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, the\u00a0 said Tan Chian\u00a0 did not succeed in his attempt to prove that the firm of Kim Hoc Hen owed him P678.09 for the six sacks of rice removed by the manager, Liao Gui, from\u00a0 the defendant's store to another near by, which, for reasons not explained in this cause, could not have been the cause of the company's owing him so large a\u00a0 sum.<br\/><br\/>For\u00a0 the foregoing reasons, whereby the errors attributed to the\u00a0 judgment appealed from have been disposed of, and accepting\u00a0 the findings therein contained,\u00a0 as they\u00a0 are\u00a0 in accordance with law, it is proper, in our\u00a0 opinion, to affirm and we do hereby affirm\u00a0 the said judgment, with\u00a0 the costs against the appellant; provided, however, that he shall be sentenced to\u00a0 the accessory penalties specified in article 61 of the\u00a0 Penal\u00a0 Code.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

No. 5982, November 27, 1910<\/h2>\n<h3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS, DOROTEO GAOIRAN ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br\/>\n<br\/>\nD E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TRENT, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\"><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">The appellants in this case, Doroteo Gaoiran, Juan Balicat, and Gerarda Sahagun, were charged in the Court of First Instance of the Province of Ilocos Norte with having violated the provisions of article 471 of the Penal Code, the first as principal and the other two as accomplices. They were tried, found guilty as charged, and Doroteo Gaoiran was sentenced to eight, years and one day of<i> prision mayor<\/i>, with the corresponding accessories, and the other two appellants, Juan Balicat and Gerarda Sahagun, were sentenced to two years four months and one day of <i>prision correccional<\/i>, as accomplices, together with the corresponding accessories. They appealed and now insist, first, that the trial court erred in permitting the case to continue for the reason that the prosecution did not present its proofs until after the defense had rested its case; and, second, that the trial court erred in finding that the appellants knew the whereabouts and the existence of Salvadora Batara.<br\/><br\/>The first assignment of error is based on the fact that the defense presented its proofs before the prosecution presented its case. It appears from the record that after the appellants entered their plea of not guilty the fiscal did not then present his proofs and the appellants proceeded to present theirs. The reason that the fiscal did not present his proofs at that time is because of the fact that the appellants in their plea of not guilty admitted that Dorotea Gaoiran had contracted the second marriage, as alleged in the complaint, and that the other two appellants were witnesses to the second marriage, reserving their right to present proofs to establish the fact that they did not know that Salvadora Batara, Doroteo's first wife, was living when he contracted his second marriage. It further appears in the record that this procedure was adopted without objection on the part of the appellants or their counsel. No objection having been entered during the trial of this cause in the court below with reference to this procedure in the presentation of proofs, and it appearing that that procedure has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the appellants in this case, the first assignment of error must be held to be without foundation.<br\/><br\/>The second assignment of error involves a question of fact. Doroteo Gaoiran admits that he was lawfully married to Salvadora Batara on the 24th of May, 1897,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He also admits that he was legally married on the 23d of May, 1908, to Maria Manuel. The other two appellants admitted that they were present and witnessed this last marriage, knowing that Doroteo Gaoiran had been previously married to Salvadora Batara.<br\/><br\/>The appellants testified that when Doroteo Gaoiran contracted this second marriage Salvadora Batara had been absent for more than eight years without their knowing anything of her whereabouts, notwithstanding that they had made diligent inquiry to ascertain whether or not Salvadora was then living. This defense has not, by any means, been established. As a matter of fact all of these parties lived in the same barrio and within a few hundred brazas of each other from the time Doroteo Gaoiran married Salvadora Batara up to the time he contracted the second marriage. Salvadora Batara lived during the greater part of this time with her mother in that barrio. These facts have not only been established by the testimony of credible witnesses who knew all the parties and who lived in that same locality, but also by two baptismal certificates which show that Salvadora Batara gave birth to two children, the first in 1902 and the second in 1904, and that these two children were baptized in the same town where these parties lived. Doroteo Gaoiran and Salvadora Batara only lived together a very short time after they were married. Salvadora Batara since her marriage with Doroteo has lived at least a part of the time with another man; in fact some other man, aside from Doroteo Gaoiran, is the father of these two children. The real reason why Doroteo contracted this second marriage was on account of his first wife living with another man and having children by him. This is not a sufficient reason for relieving him of the criminal responsibility of the second marriage. He contracted this second marriage in express violation of law, knowing that his first wife was still living and knowing that his marriage to Salvadora Batara had never been legally dissolved.<br\/><br\/>\"Any person who shall contract a second or subsequent marriage without the prior marriage being lawfully dissolved shall be punished with the penalty of prision mayor.\" (Art. 471, Penal Code.) (U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Orosa, 7 Phil. Rep., 247; U. S.<i> vs.<\/i> Macleod, 3 Phil. Rep., 510; U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> San Luis, 10 Phil. Rep., 163.)<br\/><br\/>In the commission of this crime by Doroteo Gaoiran no aggravating circumstances were present; but we think that he should be given the benefit of the extenuating circumstance provided for in article 11 of the Penal Code.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from, with reference to Doroteo Gaoiran, is, therefore, affirmed: <i>Provided, however<\/i>, That the penalty be reduced to six years and one day of <i>prision mayor,<\/i> he to pay one-third of the costs of this case.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the other two appellants, while it is admitted that they were present when Doroteo Gaoiran contracted his second marriage and that they knew that he had been previously married to Salvadora Batara, and while it has been established that they knew that Salvadora Batara was living when this second marriage was contracted, the certificate of the justice of the peace fails to show just what part was taken by these two appellants in this marriage. The justice of the peace said that these two appellants were witnesses <i>presenciales <\/i>(actually present), but he did not state that these two parties testified, or even stated before him, that there existed no impediment which might prevent this marriage, and the proofs failed to establish this fact; so the most that can be said as to the participation on the part of these two appellants in the second marriage is that they were eyewitnesses or persons who were present when the marriage took place. These facts are not sufficient to establish the guilt of these.two appellants as accomplices in the commission of this crime. They are, therefore, acquitted, with two-thirds of the costs <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">de oficio<\/span>.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Pepa, for the rent of the building occupied by the post-office in that municipality during several months of the\u00a0 year 1907; and, further, in that he certified in those vouchers that Pepa was of that building, when, as it is alleged, appellant self, in truth and in fact, the owner of the building and the real creditor of the Government for the rent due for its use as a post-office.<br\/><br\/>Appellant admitted that as postmaster of Indang he certified the vouchers introduced into the record by the\u00a0 prosecution; and that the house rented to the Government, and used by him as a post-office in Indang is and was, at the time when the vouchers were executed, his own property. In explanation of the fact that the vouchers show on\u00a0 their face that the house was rented to the Government by Pepa, that\u00a0 Pepa's\u00a0 name appears\u00a0 therein as the\u00a0 creditor of the Government for the amount of rent accrued at the end of each month, and that Pepa\u00a0 signed\u00a0 the vouchers\u00a0 in the blank space reserved on the voucher form for the name of the person with whom the rental contract was executed and in whose name the warrants for the payment of the rent were to be issued, appellant, corroborated by Pepa himself, testified that he had had an agreement with Pepa, whereby, in consideration\u00a0 of\u00a0 services as clerk, rendered\u00a0 and to\u00a0 be rendered by Pepa while appellant was postmaster, appellant agreed\u00a0 to\u00a0 rent the house of Pepa during the term of his postmastership,\u00a0 and to let Pepa recover the amount of the rent which the Government was to pay for the use of appellant's house as a post-office.<br\/><br\/>In\u00a0 explanation of the fact that\u00a0 in some of the vouchers (though not in all), the English words \"owner of the building\" are placed\u00a0 immediately under the name of\u00a0 Filoteo\u00a0 B. Pepa, where it appears in the heading\" to the voucher, and in the blank space which the printed guide words indicate as intended for the \"address of the\u00a0 creditor,\"\u00a0 appellant stated that these words were inserted there, in accordance with\u00a0 a sample voucher prepared for him\u00a0 by the postal authorities of Manila, which was made a part of the record, wherein\u00a0 under the\u00a0 blank\u00a0 space\u00a0 reserved for the name of the creditor, and on the line reserved for the address of the creditor, the words\u00a0 \"owner of the building\" are inserted in typewritings. Appellant\u00a0 states that he\u00a0 thought\u00a0 these English words were intended to\u00a0 designate the person from whom the building was rented by the Government and who was entitled to receive the rent and receipt therefor, and that since he had rented his house to Pepa and given him authority to contract with the\u00a0 Government for\u00a0 the rent, and to receive\u00a0 and receipt for it, the name of Pepa was properly inserted in the blank space which appeared to be reserved in the sample voucher for the person who was at the same time the creditor\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 Government and\u00a0 the owner of the rented building. <br\/><br\/>It was admitted by the prosecution that the accused was duly authorized to expend the amount paid for the monthly rent of the house occupied as a post-office, and there is\u00a0 no suggestion that the appellant received any undue profit or payment or that the interests of the Government in anywise suffered as a result of the\u00a0 alleged irregularity in\u00a0 the preparation of the vouchers.<br\/><br\/>It does not appear from the record that there is in these Islands any provision\u00a0 of law,\u00a0 executive\u00a0 order,\u00a0 or\u00a0 other prohibition forbidding the use and occupation as a post-office of a building which is the property of the postmaster in charge of such office; and it nowhere appears\u00a0 from\u00a0 the record in this case that the renting to the Bureau of Posts of a building for use as a post-office by its owner,\u00a0 the post-master, is prohibited either expressly or by implication.<br\/><br\/>There\u00a0 is no question therefore of the right of the\u00a0 defendant to rent his property, as we hold that the undisputed evidence of record discloses he did, to another, for and in consideration of services rendered and to be rendered, and to authorize his tenant to subrent the property to the Bureau of Posts.<br\/><br\/>There was no obligation upon\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant to disclose the details of this arrangement with\u00a0 his tenant, and\u00a0 while it would undoubtedly have been\u00a0 a more\u00a0 open, frank, and honorable transaction had he done so, we are not prepared to hold that the mere fact that the vouchers fail to disclose the nature and\u00a0 details of his contract\u00a0 with Pepa constitutes such a falsification or a perversion of the\u00a0 truth in the relation of the facts set out therein as is\u00a0 defined and penalized by\u00a0 the\u00a0 law. Whether such conduct on his\u00a0 part\u00a0 would justify\u00a0 the postal authorities in\u00a0 relieving\u00a0 him from\u00a0 his office, and\u00a0 putting another in his\u00a0 place,\u00a0 we are not called upon to consider or to decide.<br\/><br\/>The guilt or innocence of the defendant of the crime with which he is charged\u00a0 turns therefore on the\u00a0 single question whether or not, in certifying as correct the voucher wherein the\u00a0 words \"owner of the building\" appear after the\u00a0 name of his tenant Pepa, he knowingly certified a false relation of facts in a public document. <br\/><br\/>The word <i>owner<\/i> when applied to real estate, without any qualifying words, is\u00a0 generally Understood to mean in both common and legal parlance, <i> prima facie<\/i>, the person in whom is the fee simple.\u00a0 But the word owner is\u00a0 not uniformly or necessarily used in this sense.\u00a0 It is frequently employed to designate\u00a0 one having a lesser estate\u00a0 in the\u00a0 property, and speaking generally the term may be\u00a0 said to be applicable to anyone having a defined\u00a0 interest in real\u00a0 estate\u00a0 as distinguished from one in naked possession only.\u00a0 Thus it has been applied to \"one who owns in fee; the person owning the\u00a0 fee; a person who has an estate in fee simple; the legal owner, or who\u00a0 owns the legal estate\u00a0 in lands; the person entitled\u00a0 to\u00a0 the legal estate in the land; the\u00a0 person\u00a0 having the\u00a0 legal title;\u00a0 any\u00a0 person who has an equitable right to or interest in land; one who has any right which, in law or equity, amounts to ownership in\u00a0 the land - any right of entry upon it, to its possession or enjoyment, or any part of it, which can be deemed an estate in it; any person having a claim or interest in real property, though less than an absolute fee; one having an interest in or claim upon property much less than absolute and unqualified title; any\u00a0 person having an\u00a0 interest in\u00a0 the estate; any person\u00a0 having any estate, interest or easement in property; one who has complete dominion\u00a0 of the\u00a0 property\u00a0 owned;\u00a0 one who\u00a0 has dominion over that which is the subject of the ownership; one who has the right to own; the exclusive right of possession;\u00a0 the legal\u00a0 or just claim\u00a0 of title; the proprietorship; any person who has the usufruct, control, or occupation of the land, whether his interest in it be less than a fee; anyone who has\u00a0 the right of possession to property; occupier; the occupant in possession; any person occupying\u00a0 or\u00a0 cultivating lands;\u00a0 the person or persons who represent a particular piece\u00a0 of property, where there is a\u00a0 unity of possession;\u00a0 a person\u00a0 in receipt of the rack rents; a person who receives beneficial returns from the\u00a0 land;\u00a0 every person in possession or receipt either of the whole or any part of the rents\u00a0 and profits of any land or tenement or the occupation of such land or tenement, other than as tenant from year to year,\u00a0 or\u00a0 for any less term, or as tenant at will;\u00a0 any corporation or person enabled to sell and convey land; any one owning real estate whose interest is subject to payment of judgment.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (29 Cyc, 1549 and\u00a0 1550, and many cases them cited.)<br\/><br\/>In addition to the foregoing examples of the use of the word,\u00a0 all of which have been recognized by the\u00a0 courts, and some of which would undoubtedly seem to be broad enough to include the relation which, under his contract, Pepa\u00a0 bore to the house in question, there is in common parlance\u00a0 a loose and\u00a0 ill-defined\u00a0 application of the word to designate one who holds a house on a monthly renting or the like. This\u00a0 use\u00a0 of the English\u00a0 word\u00a0 \"owner,\" while slovenly in the extreme and lacking in precision, is by no means infrequent, and we do not think\u00a0 that we would be justified in\u00a0 holding beyond a reasonable doubt\u00a0 that when the defendant, in a voucher prepared by him in English, a language which he was but superficially acquainted, certified that Pepa was the owner of the house in question, he\u00a0 was knowingly\u00a0 certifying to a\u00a0 statement false\u00a0 in\u00a0 fact, as he understood the meaning of the English words \"owner of the building\" used therein.<br\/><br\/>We have no reason to believe that when the postal authorities prepared the sample voucher which was followed by the defendant, and inserted the guide words \"owner of the building\" under the blank\u00a0 space reserved\u00a0 for the person with whom\u00a0 the rental\u00a0 contract was made, it was their intention\u00a0 thereby to indicate that the rental\u00a0 contract could not and should not be\u00a0 entered into with any other person than the owner in the strictest meaning of that word, that is to say, the person in whom was the fee simple.\u00a0 Indeed so far as it would appear from the record, these guide words were used in their broader colloquial signification, for the purpose\u00a0 of\u00a0 designating\u00a0 any person with lawful authority to make the\u00a0 rental contract; and in\u00a0 that sense, under the facts as herein before set out, the contents of the vouchers in question were in strict accord\u00a0 with the truth, and4he defendant can not\u00a0 be held guilty of the crime of falsification.<br\/><br\/>Whatever may be said as to the wisdom or unwisdom, the propriety or impropriety, of defendant's\u00a0 conduct in concealing or\u00a0 rather failing to disclose his interest in\u00a0 the house rented as a post-office, his\u00a0 failure\u00a0 to make this\u00a0 disclosure\u00a0 in a voucher prepared by him under instructions from his superiors, can not be said to be a falsification of such voucher when\u00a0 it does not appear that there was\u00a0 any obligation upon him to make such disclosure, or that\u00a0 the voucher as submitted contains any statement which is\u00a0 not in accord with the truth. \u00a0<br\/><br\/>There was some suggestion in the evidence that the defendant's contract with Pepa imposed upon Pepa the obligation to turn over to defendant a small part of the monthly rent received by him, but we are unable to see how that fact, even if it be admitted as true, affects the main question involved in the case.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of conviction and\u00a0 sentence imposed by the trial court should be reversed, and the defendant acquitted of the crime with which he was charged\u00a0 and set at\u00a0 liberty forthwith, with\u00a0 the costs of\u00a0 both\u00a0 instances <i>de\u00a0 oficio<\/i>.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

FRANCISCO ARZADON ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.<br\/>\n<br\/>\nD E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>JOHNSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">On the 16th of February, 1907, the Manila Railroad Company filed a petition in the Court of First Instance of the Province of Pangasinan, under Act No. 1510 of the Philippine Commission, for the purpose of securing land upon which to locate its railroad between the municipalities of Dagupan and San Fabian, both in said province. Paragraph 3 of said petition contains the names of the owners of the different parcels of land across which the said plaintiff desired to construct its railroad. This paragraph also contains a statement of the appraised value of said land. The petition does not state clearly whether the lands mentioned in said paragraph are all the lands which'the individual persons mentioned therein own or whether they are simply the lands which the plaintiff desires to occupy and have appropriated for the use of its railroad.<br\/><br\/>On the 20th of February, 1907, the Hon. J. C. Jenkins, then judge of the Court of First Instance of said province, issued the following order permitting the plaintiff company to occupy the lands in question, and to commence the construction of its railroad:<br\/><blockquote>\"The plaintiff company in the above-entitled case having asked for the immediate occupation of all the land described in paragraph 30 of the complaint in order to commence the work of laying the track of the railroad mentioned therein, and of which the said company is .the concessioner, this court, finding that there exists sufficient reasons for granting said petition, in accordance with the provisions of Act No. 1510, by these presents orders and decrees:<br\/><br\/>\"That the plaintiff, The Manila Railroad Company, may take immediate possession of and occupy the whole of the land described in paragraph 30 of its complaint, and may commence thereon the work necessary for building the road of which it is the concessioner; that the said company shall deposit in one of the banks of Manila in accordance with the provisions of Act No. 1592, the sum of P4,500, in which sum this court provisionally fixes the value of the land the expropriation of which is sought by the plaintiff company in its complaint. The defendants are notified that they must oppose no obstacle nor resistance to the possession allowed by this court to the plaintiff company, nor may they molest the latter in its work of building the road; otherwise they will be guilty of contempt of court.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.\"<\/blockquote>On the 27th day of March, 1907, a number of the defendants mentioned in paragraph 3 of the petition filed their answer, in which they - <br\/><br\/>(1)\u00a0 Alleged that they were not satisfied with the price fixed by the plaintiff for the lands in question; and<br\/><br\/>(2)\u00a0\u00a0 Asked to have a commission appointed for the purpose of appraising the lands.<br\/><br\/>On the 3d day of April, 1907, others of the said defendants also presented an answer in which they - <br\/><br\/>(1)\u00a0 Alleged that they were not satisfied with the price fixed by the plaintiff for the lands in question; and<br\/><br\/>(2)\u00a0\u00a0 Asked to have a commission appointed for the purpose of appraising the lands.<br\/><br\/>In accordance with the petition of the defendants, on the 15th day of April, 1907, by agreement of the parties the court appointed Walter E. Jones, Gregorio Frianesa, and Catalino Palisoc commissioners to appraise the lands in question.<br\/><br\/>On the 8th day of March, 1909, the plaintiff filed an amended petition in which some few changes were made in the lands to be occupied, (See bill of exceptions, pp. 17-26.)<br\/><br\/>Upon the filing of the amended petition, on the 10th day of March, 1909, the court made a further order (bill of exceptions, p. 26) permitting the plaintiff to occupy the lands described in the third paragraph of the amended petition, with certain conditions mentioned in said order.<br\/><br\/>On the 31st day of August, 1909, the said commissioners made their report, which report contained a statement of the amount allowed for each and every parcel of land of each of the said defendants occupied by the railroad.<br\/><br\/>On the 8th day of October, 1909, and on the 19th day of January, 1910, the commissioners made additional reports to their first report.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (See bill of exceptions, pp. 39 and 40.)<br\/><br\/>On the 19th day of January, 1910, the Hon Isidro Paredes, then judge of the Court of First Instance of said province, rendered a decision in which he modified in part and affirmed in part the report of the commissioners.<br\/><br\/>From said decision the plaintiff appealed to this court and the bill of exceptions was prepared and brought to this court on the 6th day of June, 1910.<br\/><br\/>On the 24th day of August, 1910, the plaintiff presented in this court a petition praying for a preliminary injunction against the Hon. Isidro Paredes, to enjoin him from issuing an execution in favor of the defendants and against the plaintiff upon the decision rendered in said cause. <i>Said petition alleged that the defendants had requested a writ of execution upon the decision rendered in the cause, and that the Honorable Isidro Paredes would issue the said execution unless the plaintiff deposited with the Insular Treasurer a sum of money equal to the amount of the judgment, as security for the payment of said judgment.<\/i> The said petition does not disclose the date on which the defendants had requested the execution.<br\/><br\/>The record does not disclose whether or not said request was made before or after the appeal to this court had been perfected. After a due consideration of the said petition, this court issued the preliminary injunction prayed for. (See <i>rollo<\/i>, p. 23.)<br\/><br\/>On the 30th day of August, 1910, the defendants, Ciriaco Villamil, Juana Catubig, and Cecilio Catubig, by their attorneys, presented a motion to this court asking that the preliminary injunction be dissolved.<br\/><br\/>The theory of the defendants in their motion to dissolve is that an appeal in an action for the appropriation of property, under the power of eminent domain, does not operate as a supersedeas and that, notwithstanding the appeal, in that class of cases, the judgment of the lower court may be executed. In support of this contention the defendants rely upon section 248 of Act No. 190, section 6 of Act No. 294, section 5 of Act No. 1258, section 3 of Act No. 1459, and section 1 of Act No. 1592.<br\/><br\/>Said section 248 provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"The allowance of a bill of exceptions in condemnation proceedings <i>shall not operate as a supersedeas,<\/i> nor shall the right of the plaintiff to enter upon the land of the defendant and appropriate the same to public use be delayed by appeal to the Supreme Court. But if the Supreme Court shall determine that no right of appropriation on the part of the plaintiff existed, the case shall be remanded to the Court of First Instance with mandate that the defendant be replaced in possession of the property and that he recover the damages sustained by reason of the possession taken by the plaintiff.\"<\/blockquote>Section 144 provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"Except by special order of the court, no execution shall issue upon a final judgment rendered in a Court of First Instance until after the period for perfecting a bill of exceptions has expired, <i>but the filing of a bill of exceptions shall of itself stay execution<\/i> until the final determination of the action, unless for special reasons stated in the bill of exceptions the court shall order that the execution be not stayed, in which event the execution may at once issue, but the court may require, as a condition of a stay of execution, that a bond shall be given reasonably sufficient to secure the performance of the judgment appealed from, in case it be affirmed in part or wholly.\"<\/blockquote>It will be noted that the mere presentation of the <i>bill of exceptions<\/i>, under section 144 (unless special reasons to the contrary are given by the court), shall have the <i>effect of staying the execution <\/i>until a final determination by the appellate court; while section 248 provides that the allowance of a bill of exceptions in condemnation proceedings <i>shall not operate <\/i>to stay the execution of the judgment. Section 248 provides that the right of the plaintiff to enter upon the land of the defendant after judgment in the lower court shall not be delayed by appeal to the Supreme Court. The other Acts of the Commission mentioned above have not changed section 248 in respect of the question presented here. If section 248 is to be given the meaning contended for by the defendants in their motion to dissolve (that section 248 is applicable and not section 144), we would have this condition (in a case where the judgment is against the persons seeking the condemnation and in favor of the defendant) that notwithstanding the fact that the judgment is against the plaintiff (and he appealed) he may enter into possession of the land against the judgment of the court without having paid or deposited either the value or the estimated value of the property in question. We do not believe that it was the intention of the Legislature to apply section 248 to cases in which the <i>plaintiff<\/i> was the <i>appellant.<\/i> We do not believe that it was the intention of the Legislature to provide by section 248 that the plaintiff might execute the judgment, so far as he was concerned, and appeal from it at the same time, and compel the defendants, without any remedy whatever, to await the decision of the appellate court. We believe that the right of the plaintiff to enter upon the possession of the land, notwithstanding an appeal by the defendant, under section 248 (Code of Procedure in Civil Actions), depends upon his compliance with, the provisions of section 247 (Code of Procedure in Civil Actions). Said section 247 provides that the plaintiff may enter upon the possession of the land \"upon the payment to the defendant of the compensation fixed by the judgment or after tender of the amount so fixed and payment of the costs^\" etc. We do not believe that under said section 248 the allowance of a bill of exceptions in this class of cases would operate as a supersedeas, unless the plaintiff had complied with the provisions of said section 247.<br\/><br\/>Under section 2 of Act No. 1510, the plaintiff, by making a deposit with the Insular Treasurer and securing an order of the court, is permitted to enter into possession of the land upon the presentation of his petition for condemnation. In the present case the deposit made by the plaintiff was P4,500 for all of the lands appropriated, while the amount allowed by the lower court to the defendant, Ciriaco Villamil (P5,740), Juana Catubig (P14,588), and Cecilio Catubig (P2,010), was P22,338. It thus appears that all of the defendants together, who have lost the possession of their property, have secured only the sum of P4,500 in deposit, while the judgment in favor of these three defendants alone amounts to P22,338.<br\/><br\/>We are of the opinion and so hold, upon all of the facts presented to this court, that the lower court was justified in his order directing that the execution should issue in said cause in favor of the defendants who requested it, unless the appellant should give an additional bond or make an additional deposit. It will be noted that under section 144 the court may require, as a condition of a stay of execution, a bond to be given by the appellant, reasonably sufficient to secure the performance of the judgment appealed from. <i>This section does not state any time when the judge may require such bond.<\/i> Therefore it is hereby ordered and directed that the preliminary injunction heretofore issued shall be dissolved, unless the plaintiff gives the following bonds within ten days from receipt of the notice of this order:<br\/><br\/>(<i>a<\/i>)\u00a0\u00a0 One in favor of Ciriaco Villamil, for P6,000;<br\/><br\/>(<i>b<\/i>)\u00a0\u00a0 One in favor of Juana Catubig, for P17,000; and<br\/><br\/>(<i>c<\/i>)\u00a0\u00a0 One in favor of Cecilio Catubig, for P2,200, each conditioned to pay the amount stipulated, or such portion thereof as may be necessary to satisfy whatever judgment may be rendered by this court.<br\/><br\/>It is so ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres <\/i>and <i>Trent, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><br\/><i>Moreland, J.<\/i>, concurs in the result.<br\/><\/div>",

Is it not true that you, as a laborer, notwithstanding the\u00a0 fact that your\u00a0 fingers have been cut off, can easily do your work? - A. Yes, sir; but less than formerly.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. But nevertheless\u00a0 you\u00a0 are still\u00a0 engaged\u00a0 in\u00a0 such work? - A.

Can he move his\u00a0 two fingers?\"\u00a0 The latter answered: \"Yes, sir.\"\u00a0 \"Q. Are they flexible?\"\u00a0 \"A. Yes, sir.\"<br\/><br\/>In our opinion this case can not be compared with that against Malig, in which when the injured person was asked if he could follow his trade as a\u00a0 blacksmith he answered that he could not, \"I can\u00a0 no longer use this hand,\" meaning that he was\u00a0 prevented from using this principal member, \"Lupo Malig wounded Macario Valdes in the right hand, almost severing the ring finger, which remained hanging by a strip of the skin and which finally had to be amputated by the surgeon who\u00a0 attended him; the metacarpal bone of the third\u00a0 finger was\u00a0 fractured, and,\u00a0 as\u00a0 certified to by the surgeon at the trial, the said finger had become entirely useless, and could not be\u00a0 bent, and there was no possibility of it setting; the wound\u00a0 extended\u00a0 almost to the wrist,\u00a0 and nearly divided the palm of the hand.\u00a0\u00a0 Valdes received\u00a0 the wound in stopping\u00a0 the blow that Malig aimed at his head with the bolo, and\u00a0 it\u00a0 took more than sixty\u00a0 days\u00a0 to heal.\" (Extract from information.)<br\/><br\/>By paragraph 3 of article 416, above cited, a person convicted\u00a0 of the crime of lesiones graves should be\u00a0 punished with <i>prision correccional<\/i> in its minimum and medium\u00a0 degrees if, as a result of such injuries, the person assaulted should have been deformed or had lost a member not\u00a0 a principal one,\u00a0 or should have had\u00a0 it\u00a0 rendered useless *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *'.\u00a0 In\u00a0 our opinion the crime herein prosecuted falls within this penalty and should be punished with two years of <i>prision correccional.<\/i><br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is hereby fully affirmed; provided, however, that the\u00a0 penalty therein\u00a0 imposed shall be two years of <i>prision correccional<\/i>, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i> Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson,\u00a0 Moreland, <\/i>and <i>Elliott,\u00a0 JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><br\/><br\/><hr align=\"left\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup>\u00a0 13 Phil.\u00a0 Rep., 736.<br\/><\/div>",

THE ILONGOTS PALIDAT ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>MORELAND, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">The defendants in this case were convicted of the crime of murder by the Court of First Instance of the Province of Nueva Vizcaya and sentenced to death, to indemnify the heirs of Doctor Jones in the sum of P3,000, and to pay the costs of the action. This case comes to us <em>en consulta<\/em>. <p>All three accused are Igorots belonging to the tribe known as <em>Ilongotes,<\/em> living in the mountain districts of northern Luzon. They are accused of having murdered Dr. William Jones on the 29th of March, 1909, in the Province of Nueva Vizcaya. It appears that Doctor Jones was a naturalist and scientist engaged in original research in the district inhabited by the <em>Ilongotes<\/em>. During his stay among them he had received their constant aid in the prosecution of his investigations and every consideration at their hands which their simple and primitive condition could afford. The facts upon which the charge of murder is based are best stated by the only witness for the prosecution. He said:<\/p> <blockquote> <p>\"We reached the <em>sitio<\/em> of Pinapagan and Doctor Jones called the captain of the <em>Ilongotes<\/em>. The captain came there where Doctor Jones was at the <em>sitio<\/em> of Pinapagan, and he was ordered by Doctor Jones to bring the <em>balsas<\/em> (rafts) there; the captain answered Doctor Jones, saying that he would bring the <em>balsas,<\/em> but that his <em>polistas<\/em> were still looking for some of them and that they were not all prepared yet. Then the doctor asked him why he had not prepared the <em>balsas<\/em> as he had ordered him to prepare the <em>balsas<\/em> many days beforehand. Then the doctor told the captain that he would have to sleep there with us and get the <em>balsas<\/em> the following day. On the following morning Doctor Jones, in company with the captain, went to the river and there he said to the captain that as the <em>balsas<\/em> had not yet arrived we would all go to the place called Pung-gu and there wait for the arrival of the <em>balsas<\/em> which the captain's people were to bring for him. And then we at once went to Pung-gu, the doctor, myself, and the captain of the <em>Ilongotes<\/em>. Here at this place we waited for one-half of the day and at about 1 o'clock the <em>Ilongotes<\/em> arrived with only four <em>balsas<\/em>. The <em>Ilongotes<\/em> prepared <em>chow<\/em> for Doctor Jones and he ate, and after I had eaten I told the doctor that it would be better for us to go back to Dumabato, but the doctor answered me, saying that we would wait a little longer and see if the <em>Ilongotes<\/em> would arrive with the other <em>balsas<\/em>. As the other <em>balsas<\/em> did not arrive, the doctor said that we would all have to leave for Dumabato and that we would have to take the captain of the <em>Ilongotes<\/em> along with us. And the doctor told the <em>Ilongotes<\/em> there that we would wait for the other <em>balsas<\/em> in the <em>sitio<\/em> called Dumabato. After this we went to the place where the <em>balsas<\/em> were with another <em>Ilongote,<\/em> who was our companion in our trip up to this place of Pung-gu. Doctor Jones took hold of the arm of the captain and said that he would have to come along with us to Dumabato to make sure that your people will bring the other <em>balsas<\/em>. He carried the captain of the <em>Ilongotes<\/em> to the bank of the river and tried to force him onto the <em>balsa,<\/em> but the captain of these <em>Ilongotes<\/em> did not want to go and resisted. Then the doctor told the other <em>Ilongotes<\/em> to take the <em>balsas<\/em> and leave, and then it was when Palidat came near the doctor as though to tell him good-by and promising to bring the other <em>balsas<\/em> the following day, and all at once he drew his <em>bolo<\/em> and hit the doctor in the head with it and then the other <em>Ilongotes<\/em> arose and took their <em>bolos<\/em> from their sheaths and began to attack the doctor. The <em>Ilongotes<\/em> Gacad and Maguen were the ones nearest to Doctor Jones and were the ones who attacked him after Palidat. Gacad was the one who struck the doctor in the stomach with his lance. When I saw this I ran toward the doctor and that was when I saw the other <em>Ilongote,<\/em> and he wished to strike the doctor also. After the <em>Ilongote<\/em> Magueng had succeeded in hitting the doctor, I went at once to the doctor's side and picked him up, because I saw that he was very gravely wounded and I placed him on the bank. And then the doctor gave me his revolver and I began to discharge the same at the <em>Ilongotes<\/em> and succeeded in driving them away. And then we went off to Dumabato.\"<\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>It does not appear that any ill feeling had existed between the <em>Ilongotes<\/em> and the doctor prior to the assault. On the contrary, a species of friendship apparently subsisted between them down to the moment of the attack.<\/p> <p>The evidence produced by the prosecution for the conviction of the defendants was the testimony of the witness whose evidence is above quoted and the confessions of the defendants themselves, who, freely and voluntarily and without any attempt at concealment, told exactly what happened. It is significant to note that, in the confessions which they made of the acts committed in accomplishing the death of the doctor, the dominant feature appears to be that \"we attacked the doctor because he was guilty.\" It is not evident from the proofs what the motive was, that is, what the doctor was guilty of, which actuated the defendants in attacking him unless it was the protection of their chief, whom the doctor had seized and was attempting forcibly to abduct. It was just about the time when the doctor was struggling with the chief, who was vigorously resisting the attempt to remove him from the midst of his tribe, that he was attacked by the defendants and killed. While this act of the doctor did not warrant the defendants in killing him, we are of the opinion that justice requires that it be used in their behalf in extenuating the punishment which should be imposed, as provided in article 9, subdivision 4 of the Penal Code.<\/p> <p>We are convinced, upon the whole case, that justice and humanity require the application of article 11 of the Penal Code to the prisoners at bar. They were all members of an uncivilized tribe. They were reared in absolute ignorance of law and order. They were impregnated with superstitions of a degrading character, under the influence of which it frequently became the duty of one to take the life of another. They had not a single element of civilization, as that term is generally understood, and had no adequate conception of the value of human life. There is enough in the evidence to indicate that, if the facts in their favor had been fully brought out in the court below, it might have been possible to demonstrate that the act of Doctor Jones in attempting forcibly to remove their chief from their midst aroused among the tribe the highest form of resentment and required on their part the most vigorous action; and that they, laboring under such strong provocation and excitement, committed the fatal act from what was to them a high sense of duty and obligation, that of the protection of their chief, and not from cruelty and malice.<\/p> <p>For these reasons, we are constrained to give the accused the benefit of article 11 of the Penal Code.<\/p> <p>The judgment of the court below is, therefore, modified and the defendants are hereby sentenced to seventeen years four months and one day of <em>cadena temporal,<\/em> to indemnify the heirs of Doctor Jones in the sum of P1,000, and to pay the costs of this instance.<\/p> <p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson,<\/em> and <em>Carson, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<\/p><\/div>",

He is, therefore, <i>refused landing,<\/i> and ordered to be deported to the place whence\u00a0 he came, as being a Chinese person and a subject of the Emperor of China, who\u00a0 does not present the certificate required by law for the admission of Chinese.\u00a0 He\u00a0 is\u00a0 informed\u00a0 of this decision\u00a0 and he\u00a0 is further informed that he has two\u00a0 days from this date within which to appeal to the Insular\u00a0 Collector of Customs in\u00a0 case he is dissatisfied with the decision of this board.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">\"(Signed)\u00a0 JOHN R.

In fact,\u00a0 it\u00a0 appears clearly\u00a0 from the record that he\u00a0 left the Islands\u00a0 ten years before the date mentioned, and continuously resided\u00a0 in China;\u00a0 in fact that he had reached his majority previous to the date mentioned, and now for the first time claims his rights as a citizen of the Philippine Islands.\u00a0 It is\u00a0 admitted that\u00a0 he is a person\u00a0 of Chinese race and descent,\u00a0 and even though\u00a0 born in the Philippine Islands under the section of law above\u00a0 quoted\u00a0 he can not now be considered a citizen,\u00a0 and consequently his right to admission here must necessarily be governed\u00a0 by the requirements .of\u00a0 the Chinese-exclusion law, and in order to be admitted at this\u00a0 time he must\u00a0 present the certificate required\u00a0 by section 6 of the Act of\u00a0 Congress of July 5, 1884.<br\/><br\/>\"The appeal\u00a0 in\u00a0 this case is, therefore, necessarily overruled.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: right;\">\"(Signed)\u00a0 GEO.\u00a0 R.\u00a0 COLTON,<br\/><i> \"Insular Collector of Customs.\"<\/i><\/div><\/blockquote>The return by the Acting Insular Collector of Customs sets out at length\u00a0 what appears to be all that took place in the hearing before the board of special inquiry.\u00a0 These facts are neither traversed nor denied by\u00a0 the\u00a0 applicant.

The defendant appealed.<br\/><br\/>It\u00a0 appears\u00a0 that the accused,\u00a0 being a\u00a0 member of the municipal\u00a0 board\u00a0 of the municipality of Dimas-Alang, subprovince of Masbate, Sorsogon, on or about the 31st day of December, 1905, in the court-house of said municipality, assaulted\u00a0 one\u00a0 Pedro Abejero by kicking and striking him, thereby causing various contusions upon his body, particularly in a portion of the head just back of and below the left ear, and in the right side.\u00a0 By reason\u00a0 of these wounds the injured party was at once confined\u00a0 to his bed and died in consequence of such injuries\u00a0 on the third\u00a0 day after receiving\u00a0 them.<br\/><br\/>The proofs\u00a0 of the parties\u00a0 in this case\u00a0 are in complete contradiction.<br\/><br\/>Camilo\u00a0 Samson, a witness for the prosecution, testified that on a certain occasion he was called by the mother\u00a0 of the injured party above mentioned and found him in bed, unable to\u00a0 speak; that\u00a0 he noticed\u00a0 that the head\u00a0 and neck just back of and below the left ear, near the throat, appeared to be discolored\u00a0 to a\u00a0 certain extent; that the ribs\u00a0 upon the right\u00a0 side appeared to be inflamed and that when he pressed his hand over that portion the\u00a0 injured\u00a0 person appeared to suffer pain.<br\/><br\/>Francisco Avenir, another witness for the prosecution, testified that during the month of January, 1906, the said deceased was\u00a0 in the court-house\u00a0 aforesaid and\u00a0 that the accused asked him why he had not cleaned the\u00a0 street\u00a0 in front of the court-house;\u00a0 that the deceased answered that he had not yet been able to do\u00a0 so as he had been occupied in other duties; that thereupon the\u00a0 accused struck him a blow with\u00a0 his fist under the left ear which felled\u00a0 him\u00a0 to the floor;\u00a0 that thereupon the accused with the heel of his shoe kicked him in the side below the ribs; that the deceased died on the 3d day of January, about three days after he had been thus assaulted.<br\/><br\/>Juan Morada, another witness for the prosecution, swore that the deceased died on the 3d day of January, 1906; that the witness was called to see him; that when he saw him he was not able to eat and was in a condition of great agony; that he saw and observed that the skin was discolored below the left ear; that the mother of the deceased showed the witness\u00a0 a contusion\u00a0 upon the right side\u00a0 over the lower ribs; that the witness noticed at that time that the lower rib projected beyond the others and that it had a mark upon it about the size of a shoe heel.<br\/><br\/>The last\u00a0 witness\u00a0 for the\u00a0 prosecution,\u00a0 Julian Amante, declared that the accused\u00a0 beat the deceased in the court-house\u00a0 aforesaid; that he first struck him a blow with his fist below the ear which felled\u00a0 the\u00a0 deceased to\u00a0 the floor; that thereupon the accused with the heel of his shoe kicked him in the\u00a0 right side below\u00a0 the\u00a0 ribs; that this occurred on Monday, the 1st day of January, 1906.<br\/><br\/>The medical expert produced by\u00a0 the prosecution,\u00a0 Dr. Julio Ruiz, a licensed physician, who was at the time the sanitary inspector of the district\u00a0 of\u00a0 Sorsogon, testified as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Q.\u00a0 State, from the experience\u00a0 you have had\u00a0 as a\u00a0 physician, what would happen to a man if he should receive from another a blow with the fist\u00a0 on\u00a0 this part of the right side of the neck, below the ear, which blow had occasioned a bruise resulting in a swelling and\u00a0 a discoloration of the part touched by the fist? - A.\u00a0 A tumefaction of the tissues and a livid color or wound from a heavy blow in this region indicate a severe contusion of the tissues and, considering the organs\u00a0 situated\u00a0 partly in this region, the pathologic phenomena\u00a0 that\u00a0 may\u00a0 be suffered can be\u00a0 very\u00a0 different. The tumefaction and the black color denote an extravasation of the blood on the inside.\u00a0\u00a0 As in\u00a0 this region\u00a0 there\u00a0 are blood vessels and nerves\u00a0 and the larynx,\u00a0 which are very delicate organs, and this blow, as I\u00a0 said before, was\u00a0 undoubtedly the result of a\u00a0 quarrel and must\u00a0 have been\u00a0 a violent one; in these conditions, there is not only extravasation of the blood, but also a traumatic inflammation may be produced in a part of the larynx, and this inflammation gives rise to\u00a0 an oedema which\u00a0 hinders respiration, for it\u00a0 is through\u00a0 this orifice that the air necessarily\u00a0 must pass. The cerebral circulation will be retarded by the compression, and these nerves give life to the respiratory\u00a0 movements also; so that various\u00a0 phenomena can be produced in consequence of this contusion.\u00a0\u00a0 At all events, the symptoms shown by him were those of a serious injury.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Do you believe\u00a0 that the individual\u00a0 who received that blow could swallow food? - A. It would be very difficult to swallow food, much more so while the patient was in this condition of the development of the contusion; it would be very difficult to\u00a0 take food, and especially liquids.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. If this same individual\u00a0 who received the blow\u00a0 on the right side\u00a0 of\u00a0 the neck\u00a0 had fallen\u00a0 to the floor and received\u00a0 a blow with\u00a0 a shoe heel on\u00a0 this part of the last right rib, or\u00a0 on the right side,\u00a0 by\u00a0 a\u00a0 man as strong as\u00a0 is the accused - and\u00a0 if,\u00a0 as a\u00a0 result of\u00a0 this shoe-heel blow in the region\u00a0 of the lower rib, this rib was crushed inward, what might be the result\u00a0 or what might happen to\u00a0 the patient? - A.\u00a0 Such a\u00a0 blow is\u00a0 still more serious than\u00a0 the first blow received on the side of the neck.\u00a0 In this region is the liver.\u00a0 It is supposed that this blow was produced by a hard body, and from the condition in which the accused probably was and considering that the blow was the result of a quarrel, it is to be supposed that\u00a0 it was a very violent one. This blow could have produced a rent in the liver in the right lobule and an effusion of the bile, which\u00a0 would give rise\u00a0 to inflammations of the peritoneum, that is, to peritonitis.\u00a0 In the first moment of this blow the individual must have fallen into a syncope through a traumatic shock, which is always produced and always shown in those heavy contusions of the\u00a0 organs;\u00a0 and\u00a0 if the rib was fractured, the condition was more serious.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. In your opinion, after all the contusions and\u00a0 blows you have just\u00a0 mentioned, could the\u00a0 man\u00a0 live? - A. The most prudent opinion is that the man could not have withstood the phenomena produced\u00a0 by both blows.\u00a0 They\u00a0 in themselves,\u00a0 considered\u00a0 separately,\u00a0 are\u00a0 sufficient causes\u00a0 to have produced death.\"<\/blockquote>From the testimony\u00a0 above\u00a0 epitomized it appears established\u00a0 with\u00a0 sufficient conclusiveness\u00a0 that\u00a0 the death\u00a0 of Abejero was caused by the injuries which are alleged\u00a0 to have been inflicted by the accused.\u00a0 As to whether or not such injuries\u00a0 were actually sustained at the hands of the accused, we are unable\u00a0 to say, after a careful examination of the evidence,\u00a0 that the\u00a0 conclusions of the court below in that\u00a0 regard are not well founded in the proofs.\u00a0 The witnesses upon that point are in direct contradiction, those for the\u00a0 Government testifying one\u00a0 way and those of the defense\u00a0 the other.\u00a0 Under such circumstances the credibility of the witnesses is, of course,\u00a0 of the\u00a0 utmost\u00a0 importance. There being little on the face of the record from which that may\u00a0 be judged, we\u00a0 must rely\u00a0 upon\u00a0 the\u00a0 judgment and discretion of the trial court who saw the witnesses in the act of testifying and judged of their relative truthfulness. Having\u00a0 this in mind, we are satisfied that the conclusion of the court below upon the facts is fully justified by the evidence.<br\/><br\/>The objection to the conviction of the\u00a0 defendant which is argued at greatest length by his attorney is founded upon the fact that the trial court adjourned the\u00a0 trial\u00a0 of the cause from\u00a0 September, 1908, to the succeeding term of the court which was held in February, 1909.\u00a0\u00a0 Counsel for the defendant held this adjournment to be an abuse\u00a0 of discretion.\u00a0\u00a0 In making\u00a0 this adjournment of the trial, the court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"By reason of the gravity of the charges which are made against the accused, I am going to adjourn this cause until the next session of the\u00a0 court in spite of the opposition\u00a0 of the counsel for defendant.\u00a0 In view of the fact that Julian Amante has not appeared in court, notwithstanding\u00a0 that he was\u00a0 duly subpoenaed,\u00a0 and by reason\u00a0 of\u00a0 the fact\u00a0 that the\u00a0 witness Epifania Barruga\u00a0 is\u00a0 sick of fever,\u00a0 and by reason of the fact that the fiscal does not know what the witnesses will testify to, and also by reason of the fact that it is\u00a0 the first\u00a0 time that this cause has been brought\u00a0 on for trial, the cause may be adjourned for a term, especially in view\u00a0 of the fact that the\u00a0 accused\u00a0 is admitted to bail.\"<\/blockquote>Under the circumstances of the case, we do not\u00a0 believe that the court below abused\u00a0 its discretion in ordering\u00a0 an adjournment of the cause.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below is affirmed, with costs against the appellant.<br\/><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br\/>Arellano, C.\u00a0 J., Mapa, Johnson,<\/span> and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Carson, JJ.,<\/span>\u00a0 concur.<br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/><hr align=\"center\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><br\/><br\/><center><br\/><i>DISSENTING<\/i><br\/><\/center> <br\/><br\/><b> TORRES, <i> J.<\/i>, <\/b><br\/><br\/>The writer, with\u00a0 due respect\u00a0 to\u00a0 the decision\u00a0\u00a0 of\u00a0 the majority, believes, however,\u00a0 following the opinion\u00a0 of\u00a0 the Attorney-General, that the\u00a0 special circumstance\u00a0 of\u00a0 article 11 of the Penal Code can not be taken into account in favor of the defendant,\u00a0 and\u00a0 that,\u00a0 even if it be considered\u00a0 as present,\u00a0 it\u00a0 is not\u00a0 very marked, according to article\u00a0 81, paragraph 5, of\u00a0 the\u00a0 code.\u00a0\u00a0 Hence, the\u00a0 presence\u00a0\u00a0 of\u00a0 the mitigating circumstance No.\u00a0 3\u00a0 of\u00a0 article 9 of\u00a0 the same code being the only one that may\u00a0 be taken into account, it is my opinion that\u00a0 the defendant should be\u00a0 sentenced to twelve years and one day of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">reclusion temporal<\/span>, with the accessory penalties of\u00a0 article 59 of the Penal\u00a0 Code, and to pay an\u00a0 indemnity\u00a0 and costs.<\/div>",

He\u00a0 then wrote to the justice of the peace of Corregidor Island, inquiring whether he could file a complaint against her in the court of the said justice; his letter having been answered, one day Corral met the wife of the said justice of\u00a0 the peace in Manila, gave her his card (Exhibit E), offered her his services and informed her of the departure of the woman Ramos.<br\/><br\/>On another day the municipal president\u00a0 of Corregidor received\u00a0 a warrant by mail (Exhibit A), sent for Ramos and said to her: \"Here is\u00a0 a warrant\u00a0 and Captain Crame wants you because there is\u00a0 a case against you in the hands of the fiscal.\" and read to her document A, wherein she is charged with having taken\u00a0 away one trunk and a\u00a0 diamond ring.\u00a0 Juan Mapa appeared before the municipal president with a card\u00a0 from the accused (Exhibit F), and the former surrendered to him the person of Paz Ramos in compliance with the\u00a0 order of arrest, so that he could turn her over to the police in Manila.<br\/><br\/>Paz Ramos and Juan Mapa came to Manila, and\u00a0 Juan Mapa testifies that: \"We got ashore, and\u00a0 I gave the letter, that is, the\u00a0 warrant (Exhibit A) to the\u00a0 first policeman I came across and turned Paz Ramos over to him.\" Tiburcio Quiogue, who is\u00a0 the policeman above alluded to, testified to the same effect, saying that\u00a0 it\u00a0 was\u00a0 9 in the evening when he received the paper in the form of an order by Captain Crame, and that no sooner was he about to read the same than\u00a0 Corral made his\u00a0 appearance and\u00a0 told him that he could not\u00a0 consent\u00a0 to the arrest\u00a0 of\u00a0 his wife, and that no attention should be paid to the\u00a0 paper because it was a forged document and\u00a0 that the order it contained was not a real one; he said\u00a0 that whatever the said certificate might be, that he should not read it because it was a falsified document.\u00a0 Hardly had he commenced to read\u00a0 the first words when\u00a0 Corral snatched the paper from his hands and tore it to pieces, throwing them to the ground, from whence they were picked up by Juan Mapa or someone else who was there, and delivered\u00a0 to the policeman.\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore it was possible\u00a0 to present the document, pieced together,\u00a0 to the court.\u00a0 The document is of the following tenor :<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: right;\">\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"DEC. 15, 1908.<br\/><\/div><blockquote>\"The Municipal President of Corregidor.<br\/><br\/>\"Sir:\u00a0 It is\u00a0 desired to know the whereabouts of Senora Paz Ramos\u00a0 (<i>alias<\/i>)\u00a0 de Corral, a resident of No. 144, interior, Calle San Marcelino,\u00a0 who left on the 4th day\u00a0 of the present month, taking with her one trunk which contained several articles of value, a diamond ring, and several important\u00a0 documents\u00a0 which\u00a0 are\u00a0 now in\u00a0 the hands of the prosecuting attorney,\u00a0 Mr. George.<br\/><br\/>\"Enclosed I send\u00a0 a\u00a0 copy of the warrant for\u00a0 the arrest of the said\u00a0 woman for proper action.<br\/><br\/>\"'To all\u00a0 officers of the law, greeting:<br\/><br\/>\"'The arrest of Paz Ramos (<i>alias<\/i>) de Corral is hereby ordered,\u00a0 she having been charged before me with the crime of theft.\u00a0 Let her be\u00a0 brought over to\u00a0 my presence as soon as possible in\u00a0 order that the law may\u00a0 be applied as it may be proper.<br\/><br\/>\"'Given at Manila on the 7th day of December,\u00a0 1908.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: right;\">(Signed)\u00a0\u00a0 \"'R.

VICENTE GENATO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/>\n<br\/>\nD E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">About the 16th of\u00a0 December,\u00a0 1908, it was\u00a0 discovered that\u00a0 Vicente Genato, the\u00a0 owner of a store situated at No. 154 Escolta, Manila, was using a contrivance known as\u00a0 a \"jumper\" on the electric\u00a0 meter installed by\u00a0 the\u00a0 Manila Electric Railroad and Light Company for the purpose of measuring the electric current consumed under the contract for\u00a0 the lighting\u00a0 and ventilation\u00a0 of the said store; the \"jumper\" was used for the purpose of deflecting the current, thus preventing its passage through the meter and its consequent measurement.\u00a0 As a result of the use of the \"jumper\" the meter,\u00a0 instead of making one revolution in four seconds, registered one in seventy-seven seconds.\u00a0 During the whole of the time of the trial or check,\u00a0 17 lights and\u00a0 a ceiling ventilator were used.\u00a0 There was no controversy as\u00a0 to the fact that the said\u00a0 \"jumper\" was found on the\u00a0 meter, and in spite of the\u00a0 allegation\u00a0 that\u00a0 neither Genato, the\u00a0 owner of the store, nor the employees\u00a0 in charge knew anything of the existence of such contrivance, it is evident that Genato was the only person interested in the reduction of 95 per cent in\u00a0 the current, which is\u00a0 what approximately resulted from the use of the said \"jumper.\"<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing, a complaint was filed with the municipal court charging Vicente Genato with a violation of the ordinances of the city of Manila; the case proceeded to trial, and he was\u00a0 sentenced by the municipal judge to pay a fine of P200; from said judgment he appealed to the Court of First Instance.<br\/><br\/>In the Court of First Instance which tried the case, the accused demurred and moved that the matter be dismissed on the ground that the Municipal Board had no authority to enact the\u00a0 ordinance alleged to have been violated, because section 649 of the Revised Ordinances is claimed to\u00a0 be null and\u00a0 void and not binding, for the reason\u00a0 that\u00a0 the\u00a0 said Municipal Board, upon enacting the same, went outside\u00a0 of and exceeded its power and\u00a0 authority as defined by\u00a0 section 17 of the Charter of Manila\u00a0 as amended by various Acts\u00a0 of the Philippine Commission.<br\/><br\/>The court below overruled the demurrer and proceeded with the trial.\u00a0\u00a0 On the 15th of January, 1909, judgment was\u00a0 rendered sentencing Vicente Genato to pay\u00a0 a\u00a0 fine\u00a0 of P200, with\u00a0 costs, and to suffer subsidiary\u00a0 imprisonment with hard labor at the rate of\u00a0 Tl per day in case of insolvency.\u00a0 Against the foregoing judgment the accused appealed, on the ground that said judgment was entered by virtue of the said section of the Revised Ordinances, approved by the Municipal\u00a0 Board in extralimitation of its powers and authority.\u00a0 The appeal to this court was then admitted.<br\/><br\/>In order to demonstrate that the\u00a0 appeal\u00a0 was properly interposed; that section 649 of the Revised Ordinances of the city of Manila is null\u00a0 and void; and that the judgment appealed from is also void, counsel for the accused has submitted the following question for the consideration of\u00a0 this court:<br\/><blockquote>\"Has or has not the Municipal Board of Manila authority to enact and\u00a0 approve\u00a0 the provisions contained in\u00a0 section 649 of the Revised Ordinances of the city of Manila?\"<\/blockquote>By virtue of the laws in force\u00a0 in these Islands,\u00a0 it may be answered at once, without the least doubt, that the Municipal Board is duly authorized to enact and\u00a0 promulgate ordinances which become the complement of and constitute the rules and regulations by which the laws enacted by the Legislature are to be executed and enforced.\u00a0 Act No. 183, known as\u00a0 the Charter of the city of Manila, prescribes, among other things, by section 16, the following:<br\/><blockquote>\"The Board\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 shall make\u00a0 such\u00a0 ordinances\u00a0 and regulations as may be necessary to carry into effect\u00a0 and discharge the powers and duties conferred by this Act,\u00a0 and to provide for the peace, order, safety, and general welfare of the city and its inhabitants;\u00a0 shall fix penalties for\u00a0 the violation of ordinances, provided that no fine shall exceed one hundred dollars, and no imprisonment shall exceed six months for a single offense.\u00a0 The Board shall see that\u00a0 the laws and ordinances are faithfully executed and enforced, and\u00a0 shall\u00a0 have\u00a0 such further powers and\u00a0 perform such further duties as may be prescribed by law.\"<\/blockquote>Going more into detail with respect\u00a0 to the matters which may be the subject of such regulations,\u00a0 for which the said Act granted the said Municipal Board express authority, section 17 of the aforesaid organic Act, as amended by Act No. 613, provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"In addition to the foregoing the Board shall have the following general powers:<br\/><br\/>\"'(<i>kk<\/i>)\u00a0 To make,\u00a0 publish, amend,\u00a0 and repeal all ordinances, necessary to carry\u00a0 into effect the powers herein granted, and\u00a0 to enforce the same by fines and penalties, within the limits authorized by law.' \"<br\/><\/blockquote>Paragraph\u00a0 (<i>ii<\/i>)\u00a0 of said section 17 reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"To regulate, control,\u00a0 and prevent discrimination in the sale and supply of gas, electricity, and telephone and streetrailway service, and fix\u00a0 and\u00a0 regulate rates\u00a0 and\u00a0 charges therefor where\u00a0 the same have not been fixed by Act\u00a0 of Congress or the Philippine Commission; and to provide for the\u00a0 inspection of\u00a0 all gas, electric, telephone, and streetrailway wires, conduits,\u00a0 meters,\u00a0 and other apparatus, and the condemnation\u00a0 and correction or removal of the same when dangerous or defective.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The Municipal Board of Manila, in order to perform its duties, and to administer the interests of the city for the benefit of the inhabitants, and exercising the powers and attributes\u00a0 expressly\u00a0 granted\u00a0 to\u00a0 it by\u00a0 the\u00a0 organic\u00a0 law, enacted, among others, section 649 of the Revised\u00a0 Ordinances, which reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"<i>Injury\u00a0 to\u00a0 electric\u00a0 apparatus;\u00a0 Tapping current; Evidence.<\/i> - No person shall destroy, mutilate, deface, or otherwise\u00a0 injure or\u00a0 tamper\u00a0 with\u00a0 any wire,\u00a0 meter, or\u00a0 other apparatus installed or used for\u00a0 generating, containing, conducting, or measuring electricity, telegraph,\u00a0 or telephone service, nor tap or otherwise wrongfully deflect or take any electric current from such wire, meter, or other apparatus.<br\/><br\/>\"No person shall, for any purpose whatsoever, use or enjoy the benefits of any device by means\u00a0 of which he may fraudulently obtain any current of electricity or any telegraph or telephone service; and the existence in any building or premises of any such device shall, in the\u00a0 absence of satisfactory explanation, be deemed sufficient evidence of such use by the persons benefiting thereby.\"<\/blockquote>From the simple\u00a0 perusal of\u00a0 the foregoing\u00a0 sections of the organic Acts Nos.\u00a0 183 and\u00a0 613, the legality and propriety of the foregoing section\u00a0 649 of the Revised Ordinances becomes evident; the provisions of the section of the ordinances cited are found to be within the terms and ideas under which the Municipal Board has, or appears to have, been expressly authorized to enact\u00a0 it; it does not appear, by the language or precepts contained in the said\u00a0 section 649, that the Municipal Board had exceeded its powers and authority; wherefore, said section\u00a0 is perfectly\u00a0 valid and binding, and by enacting and promulgating the same\u00a0 no rule or provision of constitutional law has been violated.<br\/><br\/>Apart from\u00a0 the legal provisions\u00a0 and\u00a0 ordinances above referred to, it is highly important to society that property should be protected and sheltered from any attempts that would destroy\u00a0 or cause it any\u00a0 injury; to this\u00a0 effect\u00a0 the positive law has established penalties and means of repression for any offense or violation of its provisions, which guarantee the rights of ownership.<br\/><br\/>If the said company is the owner of the electric current that produces\u00a0 the light used\u00a0 for\u00a0 the lighting\u00a0 of public squares,\u00a0 streets,\u00a0 establishments, and private\u00a0 houses, the Municipal Board, in promulgating\u00a0 ordinances\u00a0 regulating the\u00a0 form and\u00a0 conditions\u00a0 under which the electric light furnished by said company is to be\u00a0 used and enjoyed, has done nothing more than to develop the general prescriptions of the positive law to insure its strict compliance within the city of Manila and its suburbs, in consonance with the powers conferred\u00a0 upon\u00a0 the Board by\u00a0 the special law that organized it, and it would have\u00a0 failed to perform its imperative duty if it had not enacted such ordinances.<br\/><br\/>Even without them, the right of the ownership of electric current is secured by articles\u00a0 517 and\u00a0 518 of the Penal Code; the application of these articles in\u00a0 cases of subtraction of gas, a fluid used for lighting, and in some respects resembling electricity, is confirmed by the rule laid down in\u00a0 the\u00a0 decisions of the supreme court of Spain of January 20, 1887, and April 1, 1897, construing and enforcing the provisions of articles 530 and 531 of the Penal Code of that\u00a0 country, articles identical with articles 517 and 518 of the code in force in these Islands.<br\/><br\/>If\u00a0 the meter indicates a larger consumption of current than\u00a0 has actually been\u00a0 used, the consumer is entitled to demand that the apparatus be verified and corrected, and to claim indemnity for damages where proven, or to bring such\u00a0 action as the law authorizes if it be proven that the meter has been installed in bad faith and\u00a0 with criminal intent to show the consumption of an amount larger than that actually used.<br\/><br\/>As to the provision contained in the second paragraph of said section of the Revised Ordinances relative to the fact that the existence\u00a0 in any building or premises of any device used for tapping the electric current shall, in the absence of satisfactory explanation, be deemed sufficient evidence of such\u00a0 use by the person benefiting thereby, the\u00a0 ordinance has not established a rule of judicial procedure, but a rule of evidence for the purpose of facilitating the enforcement of the prohibitory order contained\u00a0 in the regulation promulgated by the Board, as an amplification or development of the provisions of the organic law, in the exercise of the power thereby granted.<br\/><br\/>A declaration in an ordinance that a given fact, or the existence or possession of a forbidden thing raises a presumption, or constitutes <i>prima facie <\/i>evidence of the violation of a law or of a regulation that\u00a0 is a complement of the statute, does not involve a\u00a0 violation of any constitutional law, nor is it a rule of procedure.<br\/><br\/>It is\u00a0 true that\u00a0 weighing of evidence\u00a0 and the rules of practice with\u00a0 respect thereto form part of the law of procedure,\u00a0 but the classification of proofs\u00a0 is sometimes determined by the substantive law.\u00a0 Thus, by the provisions of the Civil Code, every possessor has a right to be respected in his possession,\u00a0 and should he be\u00a0 disturbed therein,\u00a0 he must be\u00a0 protected or the\u00a0 possession must be restored to him.\u00a0 (Art. 446.)\u00a0\u00a0 All works, sowings, and plantings are presumed to\u00a0 be made by\u00a0 the owner and at his\u00a0 expense, unless the contrary is proven.\u00a0\u00a0 (Art.\u00a0 359.)\u00a0 All\u00a0 of the property\u00a0 belonging to a married couple shall be considered as <i>gananciales <\/i> unless it is proven\u00a0 that it appertains privately to the husband or to the wife.\u00a0\u00a0 (Art. 1407, etc.)<br\/><br\/>In criminal matters,\u00a0 he who\u00a0 shall make use of a\u00a0 false passport\u00a0 or cedula (art. 308 of the\u00a0 code) ; he who\u00a0 shall have in his possession any tools used for falsification, and should not give a\u00a0 satisfactory explanation as\u00a0 to their acquisition or retention, incurs the\u00a0 penalty provided by article 313; he who shall have in his possession picklocks or other instruments used for purposes\u00a0 of\u00a0 robbery,\u00a0 and does not satisfactorily\u00a0 explain their acquisition or retention, incurs the penalty prescribed by article 515 of\u00a0 the code.<br\/><br\/>It can not be denied that the\u00a0 Civil\u00a0 and Penal Codes are, respectively, composed of substantive laws of a civil and penal character, essentially different from the adjective laws of procedure,\u00a0 according to the system\u00a0 of legislation in force in these Islands, and, as may be seen from the articles cited above, certain facts and conditions are specified by the said substantive laws as presumptive or prima facie proof, which must be taken into account for\u00a0 the proper resolution\u00a0 of a doubt or contention between the\u00a0 interested parties.<br\/><br\/>The provision contained in said ordinance to the effect that, in the absence of satisfactory\u00a0 explanation, the existence of the said device in\u00a0 connection with the\u00a0 electric light meter shall be considered as sufficient evidence of its use,\u00a0 infringes no\u00a0 constitutional\u00a0 law,\u00a0 inasmuch as\u00a0 no law exists authorizing the use of a contrivance to tap the electric current, and\u00a0 the repeatedly cited ordinance accords with the\u00a0 organic law and\u00a0 with the general laws which\u00a0 protect and secure the right of ownership.<br\/><br\/>For the reasons above\u00a0 set forth,\u00a0 and\u00a0 considering\u00a0 that section 649 of the Revised Ordinances is valid and binding, it is held that the judgment appealed from can neither be reversed nor set\u00a0 aside.\u00a0 Costs\u00a0 against the appellant.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

It asserts all of the facts required in the allegation of the crime of lesiones graves.\u00a0 Article 416,\u00a0 subdivision 4, of the Penal Code, penalizes lesiones graves as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"With that of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">arresto mayor<\/span> in its maximum \"degree to <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">prision correccional<\/span>\u00a0 in its minimum degree, if such injuries should have occasioned\u00a0 the assaulted party\u00a0 illness or\u00a0 disability for work lasting\u00a0 more than thirty days.\"<\/blockquote>It will\u00a0 be observed that to\u00a0 make\u00a0 the\u00a0 information good it is not necessary to allege illness and disability for work.<br\/><br\/>Matea Lim Icoy, the wife of\u00a0 Severino Manzano, testified that she\u00a0 was\u00a0 awakened from\u00a0 her sleep\u00a0 by\u00a0 the voice\u00a0 of her husband\u00a0 saying \"Trining, Trining,\u00a0 they are killing me,\" and\u00a0 the noise produced by the falling of coins on the floor of the house;\u00a0 that she saw\u00a0 the\u00a0 accused strike\u00a0 her husband with his\u00a0 fist, seize him with both hands and drag him to the store\u00a0 and when\u00a0 there kick\u00a0 him in the chest, felling him to the\u00a0 floor; that afterwards the accused struck her; that, after her husband\u00a0 had regained his\u00a0 feet,\u00a0 the accused struck\u00a0 him\u00a0 again and he was\u00a0 on\u00a0 the\u00a0 point\u00a0 of falling when\u00a0 she supported him,\u00a0 assisting\u00a0 him\u00a0 into\u00a0 the house; that at that\u00a0 moment Lorenzo del Rosario arrived and sought to\u00a0 pacify the accused, but the latter\u00a0 suddenly seized her husband\u00a0 by the hands\u00a0 and sought to\u00a0 pull him forth; that\u00a0 she grasped her husband by the\u00a0 waist,\u00a0 and as the accused was not able to\u00a0 drag hint loose from her, he gave her husband a kick in\u00a0 the side which\u00a0 felled him to the floor,\u00a0 and\u00a0 then\u00a0 she\u00a0 ordered the servants to call the police; that a policeman came immediately, followed by the chief of police, who, after inquiring into what had occurred, took\u00a0 the accused to the presidencies; that afterwards she saw contusions on the right and\u00a0 left side of the body of her husband and on\u00a0 the chest and on the face;\u00a0 that she also saw blood upon the left leg;\u00a0 that two doctors treated her husband; that from the day he was injured he was unable to work up to the time of his\u00a0 death.<br\/><br\/>The testimony\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 wife of the\u00a0 deceased\u00a0 was\u00a0 corroborated by that of her daughter, Trinidad Manzano, and by that of Lorenzo del Pilar.\u00a0 The latter testified that he saw Juan\u00a0 Pilares in the store of Severino Manzano and heard the\u00a0 latter say to him\u00a0 \"you are a teacher, without respect,\" or \"you do not know how to\u00a0 show respect, nor do you show politeness;\" that after these expressions the accused turned, facing Manzano, and struck him\u00a0 with his fist in the face; that Manzano fell into the arms of his wife, who finally succeeded\u00a0 in getting him into\u00a0 the house; that thereupon the witness tried to make peace between them; that he spoke first to the accused and advised him to leave; that he then went to the\u00a0 door of the store\u00a0 and advised the Chinaman\u00a0 to keep quiet; that thereafter the accused went\u00a0 up to the railing of the store, seized the Chinaman, and tried to pull him\u00a0 out; that he was unable to do so because the wife of the Chinaman clung to him; that thereupon\u00a0 the accused struck her a blow in the face, whereupon they separated.<br\/><br\/>It was 'proved by the testimony oi the\u00a0 physicians who attended Manzano that he\u00a0 was injured to such an extent that he required medical attention for more than thirty days.<br\/><br\/>We are convinced after a\u00a0 careful\u00a0 reading of the testimony adduced on the trial that the learned trial court properly appreciated the situation.\u00a0\u00a0 The testimony produced by the prosecution is amply sufficient to support the judgment of conviction.\u00a0\u00a0 We do not believe that\u00a0 the testimony introduced by the accused\u00a0 has cast a doubt upon the righteousness of his conviction.<br\/><br\/>In imposing sentence upon the accused the learned trial court took into consideration the extenuating circumstances of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">arrebato y obcecacion<\/span>.\u00a0 We are of the opinion that the facts proved are\u00a0 not sufficient to warrant\u00a0 that\u00a0 finding.

From this judgment and sentence they appealed.<br\/><br\/>The guilt of the appellants has been established beyond any question of doubt, inasmuch as they were caught in the very act of smoking opium on the night of March 1, 1908. The opium pipe and other paraphernalia used for smoking this drug were seized by the policemen at the time the appellants were arrested. These articles were exhibited in the court below and properly identified.<br\/><br\/>It is insisted that the appellants could not have been legally convicted under the provisions\" of section 32 of said Act No. 1761 for the reason that, according to the proofs presented, they smoked opium on the night of March 1, 1908, and that as this section did not go into effect until after March 1 of that year, its provisions could not have been violated on that night. In support of this theory counsel for appellants relies upon the Spanish translation of the first part of this section (32) which provides that <i>\"despues del primero de Marzo<\/i>\" etc. This is not a correct translation. The English text, which provides that \"on and after March 1, 1908,\" is the one which must govern, according to the provisions of section 1 of Act No. 63. The appellants can not escape the penalty imposed by the said section on account of its erroneous translation. (U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Bacarrisas, 6 Phil.

Moore began proceedings for the settlement of the intestate estate of the spouses Claro Cordero and Felipa Alfaro, and on the 22d of August of the said year 1902 - when he had not yet taken the oath of office as administrator of the estate and which it appears he did not do until the 23d of that month - he seized the land referred to, and made a formal inventory of it as property of the intestate estate of Cordero and Alfaro, enjoying1 the usufruct and collecting the products thereof until the termination of his administration, which appears to have occurred two years afterwards by reason of an injunction, not found in the trial record and only therein referred to by witnesses.<br\/><br\/>The spouses Adriano Gatmaitan and Maria Concepcion Achuy also died; and on the institution of intestate proceedings, the appointed administrator, Ambrosio Marasigan, on May 3, 1906, filed the present suit against Patrick J. Moore, praying for the restitution of the property despoiled, a declaration of ownership, and payment of damages.<br\/><br\/>The administration of Patrick J. Moore being terminated, he was substituted by Attorney Ramon Salinas, who answered the complaint and alleged, in cross complaint, that the intestate estate of Felipa Alfaro and Claro Cordero had a positive right of redemption with respect to the realty described in the complaint, and therefore prayed that it so be declared and that the plaintiff be obliged to receive the redemption price. The plaintiff, in answer to the cross complaint, after a general denial of the facts, alleged, as a special defense, the prescription of the right of redemption. The Court of First Instance of Bulacan rendered judgment as follows: \"Therefore this court finds that the ownership and the right of possession claimed by the plaintiff, that is, the intestate estate of Adriano Gatmaitan, with respect to the property in litigation are subject to the right of redemption, as a condition subsequent, which is declared to be subsisting\" and that judgment should be rendered in such terms that the cross complainant shall be entitled, under the facts set forth in the body of this judgment, to redeem the said property, by virtue of the instrument of sale executed by Nicolas Calayag on November 11, 1893, and of that executed by Francisco Icasiano in favor of the deceased Adriano Gatmaitan, on the 20th of January, 1904, by returning the price of P1,500, in addition to the expenses occasioned by the proper instrument of resale.<br\/><br\/>\"Patrick J. Moore is personally sentenced to pay the sum of P1,175.71, as loss and damages, to the intestate estate of Adriano Gatmaitan, in addition to the legal interest on this amount at the rate of 6 per cent per annum from May 3, 1906, which is the date of the filing of the amended complaint, and, in addition, to pay one-half of the costs; and the intestate estate of Felipa Alfaro and Claro Cordero is also to pay to the intestate estate of Adriano Gatmaitan the sum of P60, collected by Apolinario Pasco, at the same legal rate of interest, from the time of the filing of the amended complaint, without special finding as to costs with respect to the other half.\" (Pp. 19 and 20 of the B. of E.)<br\/><br\/>The defendant alone appealed from the judgment pronounced in accordance with these findings, and his appeal was admitted with right to a review of the evidence. The bill of exceptions having been submitted, at the hearing of the appeal the appellant prayed in this instance that the judgment appealed from be reversed, and it be declared that the ownership and the right of possession claimed by the plaintiff, with regard to the property in litigation neither was nor is subject to the right of redemption in favor of the intestate estate of Felipa Alfaro and Claro Cordero; that this intestate is liable for the payment of the sum of Pl,175.71 to which, as loss and damages, Patrick J. Moore was sentenced; and further, that the rest oi the judgment appealed from be affirmed, with the costs of both instances against the defendant intestate estate. He alleged the following assignments of error:<br\/><ol><li>The acceptance of Exhibit F of the defendant.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>The failure to strike from the record, in accordance with the objection made and exception taken at trial, a certain stptement of the defendant Salinas.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>\u00a0The declaration that the intestate estate of Felipa Alfaro and Claro Cordero has a right of redemption with respect to the disputed property.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>The finding, on the supposition of the existence of such right of redemption, that the same subsists and has not been lost through prescription.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>The conclusion that Patrick J. Moore <i>personally<\/i> and not in his character of administrator of the intestate estate of Felipa Alfaro and Claro Cordero, that is, not the intestate estate, is liable for the payment of the losses and damages suffered by the plaintiff, and<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>In holding that the Gatmaitari estate shall resell the property, without Moore,, the administrator of the Alfaro- Cordero estate, previously paying for the loss and damages caused by him to the former.<\/li><\/ol>It is evident, from the facts related, that the personal, not the real, right of redemption was neither covenanted nor agreed upon with the intestate estate of Felipa Alfaro and Claro Cordero, nor was it at any time transmitted to this estate. The right to repurchase the lands sold on the 11th of November, 1893, by Nicolas Calayag, was stipulated in favor of this vendor. The estate of Felipa Alfaro and Claro Cordero is neither the estate of Nicolas Calayag, nor does it originate with Nicolas Calayag: the first proposition is very apparent from the context of the instruments executed in connection therewith and hereinabove mentioned; the second could be denied only if the document Exhibit F stated the contrary.<br\/><br\/>This document F is an agreement made on August 14, 1902, between the heirs of Nicolas Calayag, named Nazario, Margarita and Estefania Calayag, and a minor, then 21 years of age, named Nicolas Dimagiba y Calayag, on the one hand, and on the other, Francisca Cordero y Alfaro, as the daughter of Claro Cordero and Felipa Alfaro. The agreement contains seven clauses, of which three are merely historical in character, relating to the alienation of the property made by Nicolas Calayag and to the successive transfers effected by the transferees thereof, as set forth in the beginning of this decision.<br\/><br\/>The fourth and fifth clauses, literally transcribed, read as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Fourth. That Dona Francisca Cordero y Alfaro, as the legal successor-in-interest of her deceased mother Felipa Alfaro, <i>believes<\/i> she has an exclusive right to the ownership of the said parcel of land.<br\/><br\/>\"Fifth. That, for the purpose of avoiding troublesome and expensive suits, the parties aforesaid, as the legal successors-in-interest of Don Nicolas Calayag y Sacdalan, have agreed with Dona Francisco Cordero y Alfaro, as the successor-in-interest of her mother, to settle their differences ; and to the end that the transaction may be recorded in due form, the parties aforementioned execute this public instrument by virtue whereof they solemnly set forth that they settle their differences with Dona Francisca Cordero y Alfaro on the following condition:<br\/><br\/>\" (<i>a<\/i>) The legal successors-in-interest of Don Nicolas Calayag y Sacdalan<i> bind and obligate themselves to redeem<\/i> the before-described parcel of land from the present possessor of the same (Dona Maria Concepcion Achuy, widow of Don Adriano Gatmaitan, according to clause 3), through judicial or extrajudicial proceedings, as may be most suitable, <i>they all being represented<\/i> by Don Nazario Calayag y Gonzalez, upon whom, for this purpose, their coparticipants, Dona Margarita and Dona Estefania Calayag and Don Nicolas Dimagiba, confer full power of attorney.<br\/><br\/>\" (<i>b<\/i>) On the parcel of nipa land being redeemed, the same shall be divided between the parties hereto, except the piece of land now cultivated by Dona Francisca Cordero y Alfaro, in the following manner: Two-thirds shall be delivered to the latter and the remaining one-third shall remain in the possession of the executors of this instrument, <i>pro indiviso,<\/i> share and share alike.<br\/><br\/>\"(<i>c<\/i>) All the expenses occasioned in effecting the redemption and until it shall be completely accomplished, shall be borne by Dona Francisca Cordero y Alfaro and the executors of this instrument in the same proportion as the partition is to be made, once the land shall have been redeemed.<br\/><br\/>\" (<i>d<\/i>) It shall rest exclusively upon the executors of this instrument to perfect the juridical personality of Don Nicolas Dimagiba y Calayag in the manner established by the laws in force.\"<\/blockquote>First. This documentary evidence, Exhibit F, might have been admitted had it been presented in a suit between the heirs of Calayag and Francisca Cordero, who made the contract thereby shown; but in this suit, between the intestate estate of Gatmaitan and the intestate estate of Alfaro-Cordero neither of which is in anywise concerned in the said contract, it was in nowise admissible; and the allegation of the first assignment of error would be supported in law, if its admission had been objected to in first instance, an objection not shown by the record.<br\/><br\/>Second. In that document Francisca Cordero states that she <i>believes<\/i> that she has an <i>exclusive<\/i> right with respect to the ownership of the land in question; and even supposing it to be so, for it is shown that she had no such right, such a right would not vest exclusively in her, but would also pertain to her brother and sister, Benigno and Maria, whom she testified at this trial that she had, and to her nephew Constancio and her nieces Melencia and Trining, children, the second of her brother Santiago, and the first and third of her sister Eladia. Hence, the present representative of the intestate estate of Alfaro-Cordero, Attorney Salinas, declared at the trial that \"notwithstanding that it was she who contracted with the heirs of Nicolas Calayag, she consents, in order not to cause detriment to her brother and sister, nephew, and nieces, that the redemption of the land, the subject of this case, be made by me in representation of the intestate estate of her parents Claro Cordero and Felipa Alfaro\" - a statement which the appellant requested be struck from the record, but the court denied the motion and an exception was taken by the former. This exception is now the ground of the second error alleged.<br\/><br\/>This assignment of error is absolutely without importance; in view of the one involving the principal question, it is proper to omit its consideration.<br\/><br\/>Third, and, in the present suit, as a decisive feature of such a contract against one of the parties, the right to redeem from the heirs of Calayag was not transmitted to Francisca Cordero, still less to the intestate estate of Alfaro-Cordero. If all the right to redeem that it is believed Francisca Cordero has originates from that contract, it is erroneous to allow it, because the only right that she could acquire by such contract is that to oblige the heirs of Calayag to exercise the right of redemption through the mediation of the elder of them, Nazario Calayag, and, when the parcel of land had been redeemed, to divide it between the contracting parties in the portions agreed upon; but she herself was not entitled, much less the intestate estate of her.parents, to exercise such a right of redemption, which is a private one appertaining to the heirs of Nicolas Calayag, even by the tenor of the contract itself. So the third assignment of error is substantial and is well founded.<br\/><br\/>It having been conclusively shown, adverse to the appellee and by means of his own and only documentary proof, that the intestate estate of Felipa Alfaro and Claro Cordero did not have and has not the right to redeem the lands sold by Nicolas Calayag with such a right for himself and his heirs and successors-in-interest, it follows consequently that, solely upon the ground of the third assignment of error alleged in the appeal, the judgment appealed from should be reversed.<br\/><br\/>However, it appears to be established that Ambrosio Marasigan, the judicial administrator of the Gatmaitan intestate estate, verbally treated with Patrick J. Moore, the judicial administrator of the intestate estate of Alfaro-Cordero with regard to the said redemption; that for this purpose Francisco Pasco delivered to Moore, on the 11th and 14th of November, 1903, P2,400, which Marasigan had specified for the redemption; that, on the 16th of the same month of November, 1903, Moore notified Marasigan that the price of the redemption or repurchase was in the custody of the court; that Moore absented himself, abandoned the estate he was administering, and the redemption could not be accomplished, and judicial steps had to be taken, in case No. 106, which concerns the proceedings had in the matter of the intestate estate of the deceased Alfaro and Cordero, in order to compel Moore to refund the money he had received from Pasco.<br\/><br\/>In the proceedings just above mentioned, to which Ambrosio Marasigan was not a party, oral evidence was adduced to demonstrate to Moore his shortage, in order to oblige him to make the said restitution; and from those proceedings, united with the record of the case, an argument is drawn for the purpose of showing the existence of the verbal agreement which it is claimed was made between Moore and Marasigan.<br\/><br\/>This court in its review of the case, No. 339 in the lower court, must be guided by the testimony adduced at trial by the witnesses.<br\/><br\/>Francisco Pasco testified that Eulalio Bundoc, the husband of Francisca Cordero, took him to see Mr. Moore, telling him that the latter was the administrator of the land, and that he should redeem it; that he delivered to Mr. Moore P2,400 for the redemption, and that on this occasion Mr. Moore told him that Miguel Pasco was holding the land under lease and that as soon as the lease expired he would give him possession \"as under a mortgage;\" that in fact he entered into the possession of the property, but that approximately three months thereafter the injunction was served and his possession ceased.<br\/><br\/>Miguel Pasco confirmed this account of Francisco Pasco's entry into the possession of the property, after he himself had occupied it about three months through a lease made with Mr. Moore, who received from the witness P500 on such account; and he further stated that Eulalio Bundoc, the husband of Francisca Cordero, was the occupant of the land before him.<br\/><br\/>Eulalio Bundoc testified that Mr. Moore put him in charge of the land which he afterwards leased to Miguel Pasco; that Mr. Moore occupied the land by reason of his having been bonded by the Government as administrator.<br\/><blockquote>\"Q. And how did Mr. Moore come to be the administrator<br\/>of that land, do you know? - A. Yes, sir.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Tell'what you know about it? - A. Mr. Moore occupied my father-in-law's land as administrator <i>because they attempted to redeem the land and had not succeeded.\"<\/i><\/blockquote>Ambrosio Marasigan denied that Moore placed 2,400 pesos at his disposal with which to effect the redemption, but acknowledged having received the letter addressed to him by Moore on November 16, 1903, advising him that the amount aforesaid was deposited with the court. When asked whether he had authority from the court to make the redemption, he replied that he had not; asked as to who it was that furnished the money for the redemption, he said that it was Jose Tionson, but that owing to certain misunderstandings which arose between Moore and Tionson the instrument was not executed.<br\/><br\/>The clerk of the court stated that he did not remember the fact of Moore's having deposited 2,400 pesos with the court, and that it was certain that he did not, inasmuch as the proceedings in case No. 106 show that steps had to be taken to compel Moore to return the said sum.<br\/><br\/>And, finally, the parties agreed that it was an established fact that, through misunderstandings which arose between Moore and Tionson, the latter withdrew his promise to furnish the money, and for this reason the redemption could not be effected. This is all that is shown by the testimony of the witnesses, and from which it is inferred:<br\/><br\/>First. That the redemption of the property was not to be effected with Francisco Pasco's money; if perchance, the 2,400 pesos were received by Moore with the security of the land in question \"as under mortgage,\" and, consequently, the dates of November 11 and 14, 1903, proved in the record to be those on which the money came into Moore's possession, first 1,700 pesos and then 700 pesos, do not show that the possessor of the land, Marasigan, or Father the Gatmaitan intestate estate, had been duly and properly called upon to make the redemption in favor of the Alfaro-Cordero intestate estate.<br\/><br\/>Second. That Marasigan had formally entered into negotiations with Moore for the repurchase of the property, Jose Tionson, who was to furnish the money for the redemption, being present; but it is not shown that these negotiations were carried on in due season and in a legal manner, nor did they finally acquire any legal status beyond a mere design.<br\/><br\/>Third. That although Marasigan should have acceded to the repurchase and effected it, the courts would have been unable to give force and validity to his consent, inasmuch as Marasigan's consent, as the administrator of the Gatmaitan intestate estate, was not nor could it be the origin of a right in favor of Moore, as the administrator of the Alfaro-Cordero intestate estate, so that the latter might effect a redemption which the contract did not stipulate should be made by the said intestate estate, nor by Francisca Cordero as a party interested in the said estate.<br\/><br\/>Fourth. That the redemption, so effected by the mere will of Marasigan, incorrectly informed as to who had a right to redeem, would have been null, of no value and effect, clearly contrary to the terms of the contract according to which Marasigan could only defer, upon a demand upon him by Nicolas Calayag or by the heirs or successors-in-interest of the Calayag spouses, the sole parties who were entitled to the right to redeem.<br\/><br\/>Fifth. That by himself alone, as such judicial administrator of an intestate estate, even on the demand of the Calayag spouses or of their successors-in-interest, he would not have been able to execute a reversion sale, to which in due time the successor-in-interest of the intestate estate which he was administering was obliged, without the proper authorization of the court.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Sec. 725, Code of Civil Procedure.)<br\/><br\/>So that, at the present time, neither can the courts declare this property and possession subject to any right of redemption whatever, although a representative of the estate of Adriano Gatmaitan, the last owner and possessor of the land in question, may wish them to do so; still less can the property be declared subject to a right of redemption in favor of the intestate estate of Felipa Alfaro and Claro Cordero, or of Francisca Cordero, either alone or jointly with her coheirs, inasmuch as alone, or jointly with all the heirs of Felipa Alfaro and Claro Cordero, it is not shown that the personal right of redemption, which on November 11, 1903, had been acquired by Nicolas Calayag, was lawfully transmitted to them. Neither can the courts declare in this suit that the right of redemption of Nicolas Calayag does or does not subsist, inasmuch as such a declaration would be absolutely out of place.<br\/><br\/>The intestate estate of Adriano Gatmaitan can not be compelled in any manner, nor for any reason, to execute an instrument of resale in favor of the intestate estate of Felipa Alfaro and Claro Cordero. There is therefore no occasion for any decision with reference to assignments of error Nos. 4 and 6.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the fifth assignment, as to the action for loss and damages, to the total amount of \u00a5=1,175.71, with legal interest thereon from May 3, 1906, the payment of which is imposed upon Moore personally, the rentals and fruits unduly collected by the latter have been considered in the judgment of the court below as losses suffered by the plaintiff. With respect to the amount thereof, the same is accepted by the appellant, and only the personal responsibility imposed upon Moore, instead of that which should have been imposed upon him as the administrator of the Alfaro- Cordero intestate estate, is the subject of complaint.<br\/><br\/>It appears: First, that in none of his acts did Moore proceed in accordance with the authorization of the court which had appointed him as judicial administrator; and, second, that, as stated in the testimony of Eulalio Bundoc, the husband of Francisca Cordero, Moore seized the land in question because they had tried to redeem it and had not succeeded; thus the absolute arbitrariness of his procedure is shown, and such an act constitutes a real spoliation which it was improper for him to do in the name of the intestate estate he was administering. Although, as it appears, he acted upon an understanding with Francisca Cordero and her husband, Eulalio Bundoc, yet the entity, the intestate estate which he was administering, were not the persons Francisca Cordero and Eulalio Bundoc, nor were these two persons the sole parties interested in that estate. It is not just that the estate bear the consequences of a purely personal and notoriously illegal and unjust act performed by him to whom its administration was commended.<br\/><br\/>We therefore do not consider the fifth assignment of error, as the finding upon this point, in the judgment appealed from, is in accordance with the law.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below is reversed in so far as it declares the ownership and possession, shown to pertain to the intestate estate of Adriano Gatmaitan over the property in litigation, to be subject to the right of redemption in favor of the defendant, the intestate estate of Felipa Alfaro and Claro Cordero, and in so far as it declares subsistent the condition subsequent or right of redemption contained in the instrument of sale executed by Nicolas Calayag on November 11, 1903, together with the rest of the first finding, and the second finding is affirmed, without special order as to the costs of this instance.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa,<\/i> and <i>Johnson, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><\/div>",

E. Finley Johnson, a justice of the Supreme Court, ordered the issuance of the preliminary injunction.<br\/><br\/>The said injunction having been served and the herein defendants summoned to appear, the latter, after making a general denial of the charges of the complaint, as a special defense alleged that the plaintiff was duly summoned by the deputy sheriff of Rizal for the trial on the complaint filed by Fermin Poson.<br\/><br\/>A hearing being had for the production of evidence, the deputy sheriff of Rizal, Demetrio Talisay, testified that he delivered the summons to an inspector in Pasig of the street-car company who replied to witness that he should go to the head office to serve the summons; that he went to the head office, on Calle San Marcelino of the city of Manila, in quest of the president of the company, and not finding him, showed the summons to the vice-president, witness being accompanied by an employee of the office. It was brought out that the party to whom he actually showed and delivered the writ of summons was M. F. Macling, a stenographer of the Manila Railroad Company, who so testified, and stated that he held no official position in the employ of the Manila Railroad Company, nor resided in the municipality of Pasig of the Province of Rizal at any time during the year 1909. In fact it is recorded on the back of the summons that it was this witness who received and signed the said writ.<br\/><br\/>Engracio Santiago was questioned as to whether he knew where the summons had been served, whether in Pasig or in Manila, and answered that, according to the sheriff, it was served in Manila, in the Electric Railroad Station, and that the sheriff explicitly told him so.<br\/><br\/>The defendants Santiago and Poson introduced no evidence, and the former stated, \"the witness knows that he was duly summoned, that a date for a hearing was set. The trial was had and, as the defendant did not make an appearance in the justice of the peace court, the provisions of the law were enforced.\"<br\/><br\/>Plaintiff's counsel in turn stated: \"The only question is whether the Pasig court acted within its jurisdiction.\"<br\/><br\/>The president of the Manila Suburban Railways Company testified that the company has its main office in the San Marcelino Street Car Barn and has no office in the municipality of Pasig and no general agent nor official who resides in Pasig, and that it only has an inspector there.<br\/><br\/>Those are the allegations and proofs submitted.<br\/><br\/>Section 1 of Act No, 1862 of the Philippine Legislature amended section 1\u00a3 of Act No. 1627 of the Philippine Commission in the following terms:<br\/><blockquote>\"Sec. 14.

The defendant\u00a0 also alleged certain\u00a0 facts under which\u00a0 it claimed that it was released from all obligations whatever under said policy.\u00a0 These special facts are as follows:<br\/><br\/>First.\u00a0 That the plaintiff maintained a paint and varnish shop in\u00a0 the said building where the goods which\u00a0 were insured were stored.<br\/><br\/>Second. That the plaintiff transferred his interest in and to the property covered by the policy to H. W. Peabody &amp; Co. to secure certain indebtedness due\u00a0 and owing to said company, and\u00a0 also that the plaintiff had\u00a0 transferred his interest in certain of the goods covered by the said policy to one Macke, to secure certain obligations\u00a0 assumed by the said Macke for and\u00a0 on behalf\u00a0 of the insured.\u00a0\u00a0 That the sanction of the said\u00a0 defendant had\u00a0 not been obtained by the plaintiff, as required by the said policy.<br\/><br\/>Third. That the plaintiff, on the 18th of April, 1908, and immediately preceding the outbreak of the alleged fire, willfully placed a gasoline can containing 10 gallons of gasoline in the upper story of said building\u00a0 in close\u00a0 proximity to a portion of said goods, wares, and merchandise, which can was so placed by the plaintiff as to permit the gasoline to run on the floor of said second story, and after so placing said gasoline, he, the\u00a0 plaintiff, placed in close proximity to said escaping gasoline\u00a0 a lighted lamp containing alcohol, thereby greatly increasing the risk of fire.<br\/><br\/>Fourth. That the plaintiff\u00a0 made no\u00a0 proof of the loss within the time required by condition five of said policy, nor\u00a0 did the\u00a0 insured\u00a0 file\u00a0 a statement with the municipal or any other judge or\u00a0 court of the goods alleged to have been in said building at the time\u00a0 of the alleged\u00a0 fire, nor of the goods saved, nor the loss suffered.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff, after denying nearly all of\u00a0 the\u00a0 facts set out in the special answer of the\u00a0 defendant, alleged:<br\/><br\/>First. That he had been acquitted in a criminal action against him, after a\u00a0 trial\u00a0 duly and regularly had, upon\u00a0 a charge of arson, based upon the\u00a0 same alleged facts set out in the answer of the defendant.<br\/><br\/>Second. That he had\u00a0 made no proof of the loss set up in his complaint\u00a0 for\u00a0 the reason that immediately after\u00a0 he had, on the 20th of April, 1908,\u00a0 given\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant due notice in\u00a0 writing of said\u00a0 loss, the defendant, on the 21st of\u00a0 April,\u00a0 1908 and\u00a0 thereafter on\u00a0 other occasions, had waived all right to require proof of said loss by denying all\u00a0 liability under the policy\u00a0 and by declaring said\u00a0 policy to be null and void.<br\/><br\/>After hearing the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause, the\u00a0 lower court found that the defendant was liable\u00a0 to\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiff and rendered\u00a0 a\u00a0 judgment against the defendant for the sum of P9,841.50, with interest for a period\u00a0 of one year at\u00a0 6\u00a0 per cent, making a total\u00a0 of P10,431.99, with costs.<br\/><br\/>From that decision the defendant appealed and made the following assignments of error:<br\/><ol><li>The\u00a0 court erred in\u00a0 failing to hold that\u00a0 the\u00a0 use of the building, No. 16 Calle Martinez, as a paint and varnish shop annulled the policy\u00a0 of insurance.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>The court erred in failing to hold that the execution of the chattel mortgages\u00a0 without the knowledge\u00a0 and consent of the insurance company\u00a0 and without receiving the sanction of said company annulled the policy of insurance.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>The court erred in holding that the keeping of gasoline and alcohol not in\u00a0 bottles in the building No.\u00a0 16 Calle Martinez\u00a0 was not such a violation of the conditions of the policy as to render the same null and void.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>The court erred in failing to find as a fact that\u00a0 E. M. Bachrach, the insured, willfully placed a gasoline can containing about 10 gallons\u00a0 of\u00a0 gasoline in the\u00a0 upper story of said building, No. 16\u00a0 Calle Martinez,\u00a0 in close\u00a0 proximity to a portion of the goods, wares, and merchandise stored therein, and that said\u00a0 can\u00a0 was so placed by said Bachrach as to permit the gasoline to run on the floor of said second story.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>The court erred in failing to find as a fact that\u00a0 E. M. Bachrach, after placing said gasoline can in close\u00a0 proximity to the\u00a0 goods, wares, and\u00a0 merchandise covered by\u00a0 the policy of insurance, that he (Bachrach) placed in close proximity to said escaping gasoline a lighted lamp containing alcohol, thereby greatly increasing the risk of fire.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>The court erred in holding that the policy of insurance was in force at the\u00a0 time of said fire, and that the. acts or omissions on the part of the insured which caused, or tended to cause, the forfeiture of the policy, were waived by the defendant.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>The court erred in holding the defendant liable for the loss under the policy.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>The\u00a0 court\u00a0 erred in refusing to deduct\u00a0 from\u00a0 the loss sustained by Bachrach the value of the automobile, which was saved without damage.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>The court erred in refusing to grant the motion for a new trial.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>The court erred\u00a0 in\u00a0 refusing to\u00a0 enter\u00a0 judgment in favor of the defendant and against the\u00a0 plaintiff.<\/li><\/ol>With reference to the first above assignment of error, the lower court in its decision said:<br\/><blockquote>\"It is claimed that either gasoline or\u00a0 alcohol was\u00a0 kept in violation of\u00a0 the policy in\u00a0 the\u00a0 bodega containing the insured property.\u00a0\u00a0 The testimony on this point is somewhat conflicting,\u00a0 but conceding all of the\u00a0 defendanl's claims, the construction given\u00a0 to\u00a0 this claim by\u00a0 American courts would not justify the forfeiture of the policy on that ground. The property insured\u00a0 consisted\u00a0 mainly of household furniture\u00a0 kept for\u00a0 the\u00a0 purpose\u00a0 of sale.\u00a0 The preservation of the furniture in a salable condition by retouching or otherwise was\u00a0 incidental\u00a0 to the business.\u00a0 The evidence offered by\u00a0 the plaintiff is to the effect\u00a0 that alcohol\u00a0 was\u00a0 used in preparing varnish for the purpose of retouching, though he also says that the alcohol was kept in the store\u00a0 and not in the bodega where the furniture was.\u00a0 It is well settled that the keeping of\u00a0 inflammable\u00a0 oils on the premises, though prohibited by the policy, <i>does not void it if such keeping is incidental to the business. <\/i>\u00a0 Thus, where a furniture factory keeps benzine for the\u00a0 purposes of operation\u00a0 (Davis <i>vs.<\/i> Pioneer Furniture Company, 78 N. W. Rep., 596; Faust <i>vs<\/i>. American Fire Insurance Company, 91 Wis., 158),\u00a0 or where it is used for cleaning1 machinery\u00a0 (Mears<i> vs<\/i>. Humboldt Insurance\u00a0 Company, 92 Pa. St., 15;\u00a0 37 Am. Rep., 647), the insurer can not on that ground avoid payment of a loss, though the keeping of the benzine on the premises is expressly prohibited.\u00a0 These authorities also appear sufficient to answer the objection that the insured automobile contained gasoline and that the plaintiff on one occasion was seen in the\u00a0 bodega with a lighted\u00a0 lamp.\u00a0 The first was incidental to the use of the insured article and ths second being a single\u00a0 instance falls within the doctrine\u00a0 of the case last cited.\"<\/blockquote>It may\u00a0 be\u00a0 added that\u00a0 there was\u00a0 no\u00a0 provision\u00a0 in the policy prohibiting the keeping of paints and\u00a0 varnishes upon the premises where the insured\u00a0 property was\u00a0 stored. If the company intended to\u00a0 rely upon a\u00a0 condition of that character,\u00a0 it ought to have\u00a0 been plainly expressed\u00a0 in the policy.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the second above\u00a0 assignment of error, the defendant and appellant\u00a0 contends\u00a0 that the lower court erred in failing to hold that the execution of\u00a0 the\u00a0 said chattel mortgage, without the knowledge and consent\u00a0 of the insurance\u00a0 company and without receiving the sanction of said company, annulled the said policy of insurance.<br\/><br\/>With reference to this assignment of error, upon reading the policy\u00a0 of\u00a0 insurance issued\u00a0 by the\u00a0 defendant\u00a0 to the plaintiff, it will be noted that there is\u00a0 no\u00a0 provision in said policy prohibiting the plaintiff\u00a0 from\u00a0 placing a\u00a0 mortgage upon the property\u00a0 insured, but,\u00a0 admitting\u00a0 that\u00a0 such\u00a0 a provision was intended, we think the lower court has completely answered this contention of the\u00a0 defendant.\u00a0\u00a0 He said, in passing upon this question as it was presented:<br\/><blockquote>\"It is claimed\u00a0 that the execution of a\u00a0 chattel\u00a0 mortgage on the insured\u00a0 property violated what is known\u00a0 as the 'alienation clause,' which is now found\u00a0 in most policies, and which is expressed in the policies\u00a0 involved in cases 6496 and 6497 by a phrase imposing forfeiture if the interest in the property\u00a0 pass from the insured.\u00a0\u00a0 (Cases 6496 and 6497, in which\u00a0 are involved other actions\u00a0 against\u00a0 other insurance companies for the same loss as in the present action.)<br\/><br\/>\"This clause has been the subject of a vast number\u00a0 of judicial decisions\u00a0 (13 Am. &amp; Eng. Encyc. of Law, 2d ed., pp. 239 et seq.),\u00a0 and it is\u00a0 held\u00a0 by the great weight\u00a0 of authority\u00a0 that the interest in property\u00a0 insured\u00a0 does not pass by the mere execution of a chattel mortgage and that while a chattel mortgage is a conditional sale, there is no alienation within the meaning of the\u00a0 insurance law until the mortgagee acquires\u00a0 a right to take possession by\u00a0 default under the terms\u00a0 of the mortgage.\u00a0 No such\u00a0 right is claimed to have accrued\u00a0 in the case at\u00a0 bar, and\u00a0 the alienation clause is therefore inapplicable.\"<\/blockquote>With reference\u00a0 to the third assignment of error\u00a0 above noted, upon a reading of the decision of the lower court it will\u00a0 be found that there is nothing in\u00a0 the decision of\u00a0 the lower court relating to the facts stated in this assignment of error,\u00a0 neither is there any provision in\u00a0 the policy\u00a0 relating to the facts alleged in said assignment of error.<br\/><br\/>Assignments of error\u00a0 numbers 4 and 5 above noted may be considered together.<br\/><br\/>The record discloses that some time prior to the commencement of this present action, a criminal action was commenced against the plaintiff herein in the Court of\u00a0 First Instance of the city of Manila, in which he was charged with willfully and\u00a0 maliciously\u00a0 burning the property covered by the policy in the present case.\u00a0 At the conclusion of the criminal action and\u00a0 after hearing the evidence adduced\u00a0 during the trial, the lower court, with the assistance of two assessors, found that the evidence was insufficient to show beyond peradventure of doubt that the\u00a0 defendant\u00a0 was guilty of the crime.\u00a0 The evidence adduced during the\u00a0 trial of the criminal cause was introduced as evidence\u00a0 in the present cause.\u00a0 While\u00a0 the evidence shows <i>some very peculiar and suspicious circumstances concerning the. burning of the goods covered\u00a0 by the said policy, <\/i>yet, nevertheless, in view of the findings of the lower\u00a0 court\u00a0 and in view\u00a0 of\u00a0 the apparent conflict in the testimony, we can not find that there is a preponderance of evidence showing that the plaintiff did actually set fire or cause fire to be set to the goods in quesion.\u00a0\u00a0 The lower court, in discussing this question, said:<br\/><blockquote>\"As to the claim that the loss occurred through the voluntary act of the insured, we consider it unnecessary to review the evidence in detail. That was done by another branch of this court in disposing of the criminal prosecution brought against the insured, on the same ground,\u00a0 based mainly on the same evidence.\u00a0 And regardless of whether or not the judgment in that proceeding is <i>res adjudicata<\/i> as to anything here, we are\u00a0 at\u00a0 least of\u00a0 the\u00a0 opinion that the evidence to establish this\u00a0 defense should not be materially\u00a0 less convincing than that required in order to convict the insured of the crime of arson.\u00a0 (Turtell <i>vs.<\/i> Beamount, 25 Rev. Rep., 644.)\u00a0 In order to find that the defense of incendiarism was established here, we would be obliged, therefore, in effect to set aside the findings of the\u00a0 judge and assessors in the criminal cause, and this we would be loath to do even though the evidence now produced were much stronger than it is.\"<\/blockquote>With reference to the\u00a0 sixth\u00a0 assignment of error above noted, to wit: That the court erred in holding that the policy of insurance was in force at the time of said fire and that the acts or omissions on the part of the insured which caused or tended to cause a forfeiture of the policy were waived by the defendant, the lower court, in discussing this question, said:<br\/><blockquote>\"Regardless of the question whether the plaintiff's letter i)f April 20 (Exhibit B) was a sufficient compliance with the requirement that he furnish notice of loss, the fact remains that on the following day the insurers replied by a letter (Exhibit C)\u00a0 declaring that the 'policies were null and void,' and in effect\u00a0 denying liabilty.\u00a0 It is\u00a0 well\u00a0 settled by a preponderance of authorities that such a denial is a waiver of notice of loss, because if the 'policies are null and void,' the furnishing of such notice would be vain and useless.\u00a0 (13 Am. &amp; Eng. Encyc. of Law, 347, 348, 349.)\u00a0 Besides, 'immediate notice' is construed to mean only within a reasonable time.<br\/><br\/>\"Much the same may be said as to the objection that the insured failed to furnish to the insurers his books and papers or to present a\u00a0 detailed statement to the 'juez municipal,' in accordance with article 404 of the Code of Commerce. The\u00a0 last-named\u00a0 provision is similar to one appearing in many American policies requiring a certificate from a magistrate nearest the loss regarding the circumstances thereof. A denial of liability on other grounds waives this requirement (O'Niel <i>vs.<\/i> Buffalo Fire Insurance Company, 3 N. Y., 122; Peoria Marine Ins. Co. <i>vs.<\/i> Whitehill, 25 111.,\u00a0 382), as well\u00a0 as that relating to the production of books and papers (Ga. Home\u00a0 Ins.\u00a0 Co.\u00a0 <i>vs<\/i>. Goode &amp; Co., 95 Va., 751; 66 Jur. Civ., 16).\u00a0 Besides, the insured might have had difficulty in attempting to comply with this clause, for there is no longer an official here with the title of 'juez municipal.' \"<\/blockquote>Besides the foregoing reasons, it may be added that there was\u00a0 no requirement\u00a0 in the\u00a0 policy in question that such notice be given.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the assignments of error numbers 7, 9, and\u00a0 10, they are too\u00a0 general in their\u00a0 character to merit consideration.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the eighth\u00a0 assignment of\u00a0 error above noted, the defendant and\u00a0 appellant\u00a0 contends\u00a0 that he was entitled to have the amount of his\u00a0 responsibility reduced by the full value (P1,250) of the said automobile.<br\/><br\/>It does not positively appear of record that the automobile in question\u00a0 was\u00a0 not included in\u00a0 the other policies.\u00a0\u00a0 It does appear that the automobile was saved and was considered as a part of the salvage.\u00a0 It\u00a0 is\u00a0 alleged\u00a0 that\u00a0 the salvage amounted to P4,000, including the automobile.\u00a0 This amount (P4,000)\u00a0 was distributed among the different insurers and the amount of their responsibility was\u00a0 proportionately reduced.\u00a0 The defendant and appellant in\u00a0 the present\u00a0 case made no objection at any time\u00a0 in the lower court to that distribution of the salvage.\u00a0 The claim is now made for the first time.\u00a0 No reason is given why the objection was\u00a0 not made at the time of the distribution of the salvage, including the automobile, among all of the insurers.\u00a0\u00a0 The lower court had no opportunity to pass upon the question now presented for the first time.\u00a0\u00a0 The defendant\u00a0 stood\u00a0 by and allowed the other insurers to share in the salvage,\u00a0 which he\u00a0 claims now wholly belonged to him.\u00a0\u00a0 We think it is now too late to raise the question.<br\/><br\/>For all of the foregoing reasons, we are of the opinion that the judgment of the lower court should be affirmed, and it is hereby ordered that judgment be entered against the defendant and in\u00a0 favor of the plaintiff for\u00a0 the sum\u00a0 of\u00a0 P9,841,50, with\u00a0 interest at\u00a0 the rate of 6 per cent from the 13th\u00a0 of July, 1908,\u00a0 with costs.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Corpus, and Pastor Duenas each\u00a0 guilty of the crime charged in the\u00a0 said complaint, and sentenced each to be imprisoned for a period of fourteen years of <i>cadena temporal,<\/i> to suffer the accessory penalties provided for in article 56 of the Penal Code; each to pay one-ninth of the costs and to restore to Alejo\u00a0 de Guzman and Toribia de\u00a0 Guzman the moneys and goods robbed from them respectively, and in default thereof, that they should jointly and severally pay to the said Alejo\u00a0 de Guzman the sum of P520 and to Toribia de Guzman the sum of P35.50 and to Maria Bautista the sum of P17.<br\/><br\/>From this sentence\u00a0 of the\u00a0 lower\u00a0 court the defendants each appealed and made the following assignments of error in this court:<br\/><br\/>First. That the court erred in holding that the\u00a0 guilt\u00a0 of the accused Santiago Alumisin,\u00a0 Esteban\u00a0 G. Corpus, and Pastor Duenas was proved beyond reasonable doubt.<br\/><br\/>Second.\u00a0 The court erred in finding that the wounds inflicted upon the offended parties were such as to bring the case within the provisions of paragraph 4 of article 508 of the Penal Code.<br\/><br\/>Third. The court erred in holding that in the commission of the\u00a0 crime there was present the aggravating circumstance of nocturnity and that the nighttime was selected in which to commit the crime.<br\/><br\/>Fourth. The court erred in holding that in the commission of the crime there was present the aggravating circumstance that it was committed in an uninhabited place.<br\/><br\/>From the record it appears that Alejo de Guzman, Mariano Evangelista, and Francisco Bato were the owners of two fisheries\u00a0 located in the\u00a0 pueblo of Bayambang, in\u00a0 the Province of\u00a0 Pangasinan; that said\u00a0 fisheries were located upon or near the boundary line between the pueblos of Bayambang, in the Province of Pangasinan, and the pueblo of Moncada, in\u00a0 the Province of Tarlac; that there had been some question between the two pueblos relating to the said fisheries.\u00a0\u00a0 The pueblo of Moncada contended that said fisheries belonged to it; that the boundary line between the said pueblos, when properly located,\u00a0 would show that said fisheries belonged to the pueblo of Moncada.<br\/><br\/>Some time\u00a0 prior to\u00a0 the time of the commission of the alleged\u00a0 crime there was an election for the office of <i>presidente<\/i> of the pueblo of Moncada.\u00a0 The defendant, Santiago Alumisin, promised his people that\u00a0 if he\u00a0 were elected as <i>presidente<\/i> at said election he would take such steps as were necessary to bring\u00a0 the said\u00a0 fisheries within his pueblo. Upon this issue it appears that the said Santiago Alumisin was elected to the office of <i>presidente<\/i>\u00a0 (mayor).\u00a0\u00a0 The taxes paid by the said\u00a0 fisheries into the municipal treasury was a considerable sum, sufficient at least to make it worth while for the pueblo to assert its right to them.\u00a0 After the election certain\u00a0 protests were presented against the election of the. said Santiago Alumisin.\u00a0 One of the first acts\u00a0 of the said defendant, after his election to the office of <i>presidente<\/i>, was to secure authority from his\u00a0 municipal council to attempt to locate the\u00a0 boundary marking the\u00a0 division line between his pueblo and the pueblo of Bayambang.\u00a0\u00a0 He was authorized by resolution of the municipal\u00a0 council to make said investigation.\u00a0 It appears from the record\u00a0 that on the 8th of January, 1908, two days after assuming\u00a0 his duties as <i>presidente, <\/i> this defendant, with a\u00a0 company of some thirteen persons, including1 the members of the municipal council, certain\u00a0 members,\u00a0 of a committee known as an agricultural committee of the pueblo, the\u00a0 sergeant of police, and certain municipal police, left\u00a0 the pueblo (Moncada) for the purpose of attempting to locate said\u00a0 boundary line.\u00a0 On this occasion they found\u00a0 one\u00a0 of\u00a0 the monuments marking the said division line.<br\/><br\/>On the 18th of January, 1908, another attempt was made by the defendant to locate other monuments marking said division line.\u00a0\u00a0 On this\u00a0 second expedition he was accompanied\u00a0 by five others, to wit: Eduvigis Corpus, Esteban Cajulao, Esteban\u00a0 G.\u00a0 Corpus (sergeant\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 municipal police), Pastor Duenas\u00a0 (a municipal policeman), and Jose Cabusay.\u00a0 Before\u00a0 leaving their pueblo they had received information that there was another\u00a0 monument marking the division line, located near the fisheries in question, and that Mariano Evangelista, one\u00a0 of the proprietors of the fisheries, knew\u00a0 where the said monument was located.\u00a0 With this\u00a0 information the\u00a0 said <i>presidente<\/i> and his companions went directly to the house of Mariano Evangelista.\u00a0\u00a0 Upon their arrival there\u00a0 (January 18) Mariano Evangelista refused to point out the monument or\u00a0 to give them any information\u00a0 relating thereto.\u00a0 The defendant, Santiago Alumisin, and his companions on this day remained at said fishery, took their meal in the middle\u00a0 of the day and remained there until the cool of the evening before they returned home.\u00a0 So far as the record shows there was nothing but the kindliest relations between the defendant, Santiago Alumisin, and his companions\u00a0 and the owners of the fishery on said day. <br\/><br\/>On this occasion there was at the fishery a young girl known as Toribia de Guzman,\u00a0 a relative of one of the owners of the fishery, Alejo de Guzman.\u00a0 On this occasion the defendant, Santiago Alumisin, entered\u00a0 into a somewhat trivial conversation with the young girl and wrote a statement in a book which she had, which statement did not reflect\u00a0 much credit upon\u00a0 his dignity as <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">presidente<\/span> of the pueblo.\u00a0\u00a0 However, there was nothing in the statement which in any way points to his\u00a0 guilt of the crime with\u00a0 which he\u00a0 is now charged.<br\/><br\/>Later, on the night of the 23d of January, 1908,\u00a0 some time between the hours of 12 and 2\u00a0 o'clock, a band of robbers, composed of from ten to fifteen persons, armed with revolvers, a gun and bolos, it is alleged, appeared\u00a0 at said fishery and entered the camarin or house where the owners of the said fisheries lived, and by means of force and intimidation, representing themselves to\u00a0 be of\u00a0 the authorities, did rob said occupants of about P400 in money, one carabao and certain other effects.\u00a0 During the commission of the robbery some of the occupants of the house were maltreated and wounded.\u00a0\u00a0 The evidence is very conflicting with reference to the exact time when the robbery\u00a0 was committed. None of the witnesses attempted to state the exact time of night.\u00a0 Some of them say that it\u00a0 was about midnight; other\u00a0 say that it was about\u00a0 1 o'clock; others that it was sometime between midnight and 2 o'clock.\u00a0\u00a0 We think that the evidence shows that if the robbery was committed at all, it was\u00a0 committed sometime between midnight and 2 o'clock in the morning.<br\/><br\/>After the robbers went away, two of the occupants of the house, Mariano Evangelista and Francisco Bato, went to the pueblo of Bayambang, which was some distance away, for the purpose of giving a report to the authorities of said robbery.\u00a0 Upon their arrival in the pueblo\u00a0 of Bayambang, about 6 o'clock in the morning, they\u00a0 first met a policeman, who was at the municipal building, and told him about the robbery.\u00a0 This policeman asked them if they could give the names of the robbers.\u00a0 They answered him\u00a0 that they could not.\u00a0\u00a0 The policeman called the <i>presidente<\/i> of the municipality of Bayambang to give to him an account\u00a0 of the\u00a0 robbery. The <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">presidente<\/span>\u00a0 called these two persons and asked them if they recognized any of the robbers, and if they could\u00a0 give the names of any one of the said robbers.\u00a0\u00a0 They answered the <i>presidente<\/i> that they did not recognize\u00a0 any of them.<br\/><br\/>Upon hearing their account of the robbery, the<i> presidente<\/i> sent a\u00a0 member of the Constabulary, Gregorio Torio, together with certain policemen, to the scene of the alleged robbery, for the purpose of making an investigation of the said robbery.\u00a0 Mariano Evangelista\u00a0 and Francisco Bato accompanied the said Gregorio Torio and the policemen back to the fishery.<br\/><br\/>Gregorio Torio testified as a witness on the trial of the cause.\u00a0\u00a0 He said that upon his arrival at the fishery, some of the occupants of the house, at least three of them, if not four, told him that they had recognized at least three of the robbers and that they were the defendants,\u00a0 Santiago Alumisin, Esteban G. Corpus, and Pastor Duenas.<br\/><br\/>After Gregorio Torio\u00a0 had made\u00a0 an investigation, he started\u00a0 back to the pueblo of Bayambang.\u00a0 He swore that the occupants of the robbed house told him that the robbers were Santiago Alumisin, and the other two were the policemen of the pueblo of\u00a0 Moncada.\u00a0 We think the question pertinent - If Gregorio\u00a0 Torio had been informed who\u00a0 the robbers were, why did he not go to the pueblo of Moncada, instead\u00a0 of returning to the pueblo of Bayambang?\u00a0 These two pueblos are in different directions from the fisheries. After\u00a0 Gregorio\u00a0 Torio and his companions had started back to\u00a0 the pueblo of Bayambang, and after they had gone some distance,\u00a0 the occupants\u00a0 of the\u00a0 robbed\u00a0 house saw a number of individuals crossing a river near by, coming in the direction of the\u00a0 house.\u00a0 The occupants\u00a0 immediately raised the cry that the robbers were returning and sent a messenger after Gregorio Torio and requested him and his companions to return.\u00a0 Gregorio Torio and his companions, upon the request, did return to the fishery.\u00a0 Upon his return there he found the defendants in the present cause, and placed them under arrest and took them to the pueblo of Bayambang.<br\/><br\/>There is much conflict in the testimony relating to\u00a0 the conversation which took place between Gregorio Torio and Santiago Alumisin and the other defendants at the time of their arrest.<br\/><br\/>The defendants, Santiago Alumisin and his companions, arrived at the fisheries on the morning of the 24th of January, sometime between 8 and 10 o'clock.\u00a0 We think that the weight of the testimony shows that they arrived there about 9\u00a0 o'clock in the morning.\u00a0\u00a0 Gregorio Torio took the defendants and two of the occupants of the house, Mariano Evangelista and Francisco Bato, to\u00a0 the pueblo of Bayambang.\u00a0 Sometime during the\u00a0 afternoon (January 24)\u00a0 the auxiliary justice of the\u00a0 peace made some investigation of the robbery and took\u00a0 the\u00a0 statements of Mariano Evangelista and Francisco Bato.\u00a0 Francisco Bato stated that he did not recognize any of the persons who committed the robbery.\u00a0 Mariano Evangelista said that he thought that he recognized Santiago Alumisin by his voice.<br\/><br\/>Later a further investigation was\u00a0 held\u00a0 by the justice of the peace of the\u00a0 pueblo of Bayambang.\u00a0\u00a0 The defendants were arrested and detained and later\u00a0 the cause was brought on for trial in the Court\u00a0 of\u00a0 First Instance.\u00a0 During\u00a0 the trial in the Court of First Instance, the said Alejo de Guzman, Toribia de\u00a0 Guzman, Mariano Evangelista, Francisco Bato\u00a0 and other\u00a0 witnesses were\u00a0 sworn in behalf\u00a0 of\u00a0 the prosecution. In the Court of\u00a0 First Instance Alejo de Guzman,\u00a0 Toribia de Guzman, Mariano Evangelista, and Francisco Bato swore positively that they identified on the night of the robbery the defendants Santiago Alumisin, Esteban G. Corpus, and Pastor Duefias.\u00a0 Their statements relating to the identification of the defendants seem to be positive and unequivocal.\u00a0 There is much conflict between them, however,\u00a0 relating to the appearance of these defendants on\u00a0 the night\u00a0 in question.\u00a0 Some of them say that the defendants wore hats; others swore that they did not wear hats.\u00a0 One of them stated that the <i>presidente<\/i> had a handkerchief tied around his head; others swore positively that the <i>presidente <\/i>had nothing on his head whatever.\u00a0 Some of them swore that the defendants had their faces covered with mud;\u00a0 others say that their faces were not covered with mud.\u00a0 This conflict between their sworn\u00a0 statements seems to lend some doubt to the veracity and truthfulness of their relation of the\u00a0 facts.\u00a0\u00a0 This conflict between their statements,\u00a0 added to the fact\u00a0 that they each swore that between the time\u00a0 of the robbery\u00a0 and\u00a0 the time\u00a0 when the alleged robbers returned the next morning, there was no statement made by any of them, among themselves, relating to the identity\u00a0 of the\u00a0 persons who\u00a0 had committed\u00a0 the robbery, seems to lend additional doubt to the credibility of their statements made during the trial\u00a0 of the cause.<br\/><br\/>The defendants make an effort to show that their presence at the fishery at any time between 12 and 2 o'clock on the night of\u00a0 the\u00a0 23d of\u00a0 January was\u00a0 impossible.\u00a0 The defendant, Santiago Alumisin, proved to\u00a0 our mind beyond peradventure of doubt, that he was in\u00a0 the pueblo of Moncada up to and after 12 o'clock on said night.\u00a0 The other defendants were\u00a0 accounted for, especially the policeman, during the entire night up to about 6 o'clock in the morning of the 24th.\u00a0\u00a0 The records\u00a0 of the police station show this fact.\u00a0 It is further shown that on the morning of the 24th, on or about 6 o'clock, one\u00a0 of the defendants, the sergeant of police,\u00a0 hired a\u00a0 horse of a\u00a0 Chinaman\u00a0 in the\u00a0 pueblo of Moncada.<br\/><br\/>It will be remembered that at the time the robbery was committed the band was then composed\u00a0 of from\u00a0 ten to fifteen persons.\u00a0 When the presidente and his companions arrived\u00a0 at the fishery on the\u00a0 morning of the 24th, about 9 o'clock,\u00a0 there\u00a0 were but\u00a0 nine persons in said\u00a0 company. The lower court acquitted six of the nine.\u00a0 If the <i>presidente<\/i> was a member of the band of robbers\u00a0 on the night of the 23d, the band being composed of from ten to fifteen persons, he must have left the fisheries and formed another band composed of different persons, and returned to the fisheries the next morning.\u00a0\u00a0 In order to have accomplished this he must have gone from his pueblo to the fisheries after 12 o'clock at night, and returned to his pueblo before 6\u00a0 o'clock in the morning and\u00a0 organized his\u00a0 second band.\u00a0 The possibility or impossibility\u00a0 of doing this would depend somewhat upon the distance between his pueblo and the fisheries. The evidence\u00a0 does\u00a0 not\u00a0 show clearly the\u00a0 distance.\u00a0\u00a0 Some of the witnesses swore that it would require about six hours to walk the distance; others said that the distance might be walked in four hours.\u00a0\u00a0 The fact is that the <i>presidente<\/i> and his companions who were arrested at the fisheries on the morning of the 24th, left the pueblo of Moncada on or about 6 a. m., all of them being on horseback, except two of them.\u00a0 They did not arrive at the fisheries until at or about 9 o'clock.\u00a0 This would seem to prove that it required at least three hours, more or less, to go on horseback from the\u00a0 pueblo\u00a0 of\u00a0 Moncada\u00a0 to said fisheries.\u00a0 It seems unreasonable to us to believe that the <i>presidente<\/i> should have organized a band of robbers composed\u00a0 of\u00a0 ten\u00a0 or fifteen persons, after 12\u00a0 o'clock at\u00a0 night, and have\u00a0 gone to the fisheries and\u00a0 committed the alleged\u00a0 robbery,\u00a0 and have returned to his pueblo and have organized another band composed of nine persons before 6 o'clock in the morning, and have returned to the fisheries by 9 o'clock.\u00a0 No proof was presented showing or tending to show when the <i>presidente<\/i> and his companions arrived at the fisheries the next morning,\u00a0 before the\u00a0 return\u00a0 of Gregorio Torio, that he or his companions had intended to commit any acts of violence toward the owners of the fisheries.<br\/><br\/>According to the testimony of the owners of the fisheries, the robbers made\u00a0 a\u00a0 thorough search, of the house at the time of the robbery\u00a0 and\u00a0 carried away all\u00a0 of the money which they had.\u00a0 If these defendants were the persons who committed the\u00a0 robbery at\u00a0 night, they must have known, because of their\u00a0 search\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 house,\u00a0 as\u00a0 alleged by the offended persons, that there\u00a0 was no other property there to rob.\u00a0 For what purpose then did they return the next morning in\u00a0 broad\u00a0 daylight?\u00a0 If they had been recognized during the time of the robbery, they must have known it, and\u00a0 why\u00a0 did they return the next morning\u00a0 for\u00a0 further identification?\u00a0 It\u00a0 seems\u00a0 unreasonable\u00a0 to us that the <i>presidente<\/i>, if he had\u00a0 been a member\u00a0 of the band of\u00a0 robbers on the night in question,\u00a0 should have returned\u00a0 there the next morning in broad daylight.\u00a0 He knew the occupants of the house and he knew that they knew him.\u00a0 He had spent the entire day there just a few days before the time of the robbery.<br\/><br\/>The fact that the defendant Santiago Alumisin had been elected <i>presidente <\/i>of his pueblo upon his promise to locate accurately the boundary line between the pueblo of Moncada and the pueblo of Bayambang, and the fact that his municipal council had expressly authorized him after his election\u00a0 to attempt to locate said boundary line, and the fact that he\u00a0 had made two expeditions before the morning of the\u00a0 24th for the purpose of\u00a0 finding\u00a0 the\u00a0 monuments located upon said boundary line, seem to justify his contention that he, together with\u00a0 the sergeant of police of his pueblo, the agricultural committee of his pueblo, and other policemen were at the fisheries on the morning in question for the purpose of making a\u00a0 further investigation and that they were not\u00a0 there\u00a0 for the purpose of committing\u00a0 a robbery.\u00a0 These facts seem to us to be sufficient to refute absolutely\u00a0 the contention of the prosecution,\u00a0 that\u00a0 the defendants\u00a0 Santiago Alumisin, Esteban\u00a0 G. Corpus, and Pastor Duenas,\u00a0 together with ten or more other persons, were present at the fisheries between 12 and 2 o'clock on the night of the 23d of January, and then and there assisted in\u00a0 the commission\u00a0 of the alleged robbery.\u00a0 The\u00a0 fact that the witnesses for the prosecution,\u00a0 after having recognized some of\u00a0 the\u00a0 robbers, failed to communicate to each other the names of the persons recognized; the fact that two of the persons robbed who went to the pueblo of Bayambang the next\u00a0 morning to give an\u00a0 account of the robbery, failed to give the names\u00a0 of the persons they recognized among the robbers, together with the fact that Gregorio Torio, as he alleged, had been given the names of some of the robbers, started to return to the pueblo of Bayambang, instead of going in\u00a0 the direction of Moncada, all taken together, seem to throw much doubt upon the credibility of the statements of\u00a0 the persons robbed,\u00a0 when they swore in\u00a0 the\u00a0 Court of First Instance, during the trial of the cause,\u00a0 that at the time of the robbery they recognized the presidente and the sergeant\u00a0 of police.<br\/><br\/>Upon all of the facts presented\u00a0 during the trial of the cause, we are of the opinion and so hold that the evidence does\u00a0 not\u00a0 show beyond peradventure of doubt that the appellants Santiago Alumisin, Esteban G. Corpus, and Pastor Duenas assisted in the commission of said robbery.\u00a0 Therefore\u00a0 the\u00a0 judgment of the lower court is hereby reversed, the complaint against these defendants is hereby\u00a0 ordered to\u00a0 be dismissed\u00a0 and\u00a0 the defendants\u00a0 discharged\u00a0 from\u00a0 the custody of the law, with costs <i>de oficio<\/i>.\u00a0 So\u00a0 ordered.<br\/><i><br\/>Torres, Mapa, Carson,<\/i> and <i>Moreland, JJ., <\/i>concur.<i><br\/><br\/>Arellano, C.

The only question litigated is the value of the land sought to be condemned.\u00a0\u00a0 At the proper point in the proceedings the Court of First Instance appointed three commissioners, in accordance with the law,\u00a0 with instructions to\u00a0 proceed and ascertain the\u00a0 value of the land and to make their report to the court.\u00a0 It appears from the record that the commission proceeded to view the land and to take proofs in relation to its\u00a0 value.\u00a0 The\u00a0 evidence taken was\u00a0 documentary only and consisted simply of deeds showing conveyances of land between persons living in that community and\u00a0 containing the prices paid by the vendees\u00a0 therefor.<br\/><br\/>The commission\u00a0 was divided in its report.\u00a0 Two\u00a0 members found the\u00a0 value\u00a0 of the land to be P56,337.18.\u00a0 The third, disagreeing with his associates, found the value to be P27,415.92.\u00a0 Upon the coming in of the report the court took additional\u00a0 testimony, which consisted\u00a0\u00a0 of evidence respecting the benefits which the remaining lands\u00a0 of the defendants would\u00a0 enjoy by reason of the building\u00a0 of the railroad, and also relating to the rental\u00a0 value of\u00a0 various pieces of land in that locality.\u00a0 After taking this additional evidence,\u00a0 the court found that\u00a0 the amount stated as the value of the\u00a0 land in the report of the majority was excessive\u00a0 and unsupported by the evidence, and, agreeing with the dissident commissioner, found that the real\u00a0 value of the land was P27,415.92.\u00a0 The defendant landowners appealed to this court from that judgment.<br\/><br\/>As we have before said, the only evidence\u00a0 before\u00a0 us to support the finding of the commissioners consists of documents which are simply deeds\u00a0 of transfer of real estate between parties in that community showing the prices paid by the vendees\u00a0 in\u00a0 such conveyances.\u00a0 The only evidence in the record to support the finding of the court below as to the value of the land, as he found it, is that taken before the commissioners,\u00a0 which consists in the documents aforementioned, and that taken by the court upon\u00a0 the hearing on the coming in of the report of the commissioners.\u00a0 It is apparent,\u00a0 without argument,\u00a0 that the\u00a0 evidence\u00a0 relied upon to support the finding of the commissioners, as\u00a0 well as that presented to sustain the decision\u00a0 of the court, is wholly incompetent for the purpose.\u00a0\u00a0 Deeds showing transfer of land in the locality in question and the price at which such\u00a0 land was transferred, standing alone, are wholly incompetent as evidence of value, even\u00a0 though such deeds contain the price for which the land sold.\u00a0 The rental value of lands in the locality in which lies the land sought to be condemned, standing alone, is also utterly\u00a0 incompetent to support a finding of value.\u00a0 There is, therefore, in all the case\u00a0 not a particle\u00a0 of legal evidence which shows value. The value which ought to be shown\u00a0 is the market value of the land in that locality.\u00a0 By market value we mean the price fixed by buyer and seller in the open market in the usual and ordinary course of legal trade and competition; the price and value of the article\u00a0 established or shown by sale, public or private, in the ordinary way of business; the fair value of the property as between one who desires to\u00a0 purchase and one who desires to sell; the current price; the general or ordinary price for which property may be bought and sold\u00a0 in\u00a0 that locality.\u00a0 Undoubtedly deeds conveying property in the same locality are\u00a0 of value in determining the market\u00a0 value of land in that vicinity, provided\u00a0 they are shown to have been made in the ordinary course of legal business and competition and that the prices stated therein were\u00a0 real and not affected by unusual conditions.\u00a0 Standing alone, however, they may be very misleading.\u00a0\u00a0 One person may desire a piece of land in a given\u00a0 locality very much more\u00a0 than any other\u00a0 person.\u00a0 He may, for some special reason, desire it so much that he is willing to pay three or four times its value in order to secure it.\u00a0 A deed exhibiting such a value would be no criterion of the real value of property in that community.<br\/><br\/>The Court of First Instance had the\u00a0 undoubted\u00a0 right to reject the report of the commissioners,\u00a0 if that\u00a0 report\u00a0 was not founded\u00a0 upon legal evidence.\u00a0 The\u00a0 judge had the\u00a0 undoubted right also to discharge the commission and appoint a new one.\u00a0 Conceding, without deciding, that he also\u00a0 had the right to formulate an opinion\u00a0 of his own as to the value of the land in question, nevertheless, if he formulate such an opinion, he must base it upon competent evidence. The difficulty with the ease is that it affirmatively appears from\u00a0 the record on appeal that there is an entire absence of competent evidence to support the finding either of the commissioners\u00a0 or of\u00a0 the\u00a0 court,\u00a0 even if the court had a right\u00a0 to make a finding of his own at all under the circumstances.<br\/><br\/>We believe that justice requires\u00a0 the\u00a0 appointment\u00a0 of a new commission to ascertain the value of the land, and the granting of a new trial generally.<br\/><br\/>For the\u00a0 reasons expressed, the judgment of the court below is reversed\u00a0 and the\u00a0 commission\u00a0 discharged.\u00a0 The cause\u00a0 is remanded to the Court of\u00a0 First Instance,\u00a0 with instructions to\u00a0 appoint a new commission for the purpose of ascertaining the\u00a0 value of the land in\u00a0 question\u00a0 in due form\u00a0 of law; and for such other and further proceedings as law requires.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

PEDRO RAMIREZ, JUDICIAL ADMINISTRATOR OF THE ESTATE OF VICTORINO BUHAY, DECEASED, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<br\/>\n<br\/>\nD E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>MAPA, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">The appellants herein presented a claim for 2,890.59 pesos to the committee\u00a0 of\u00a0 appraisal of the estate of Victorino Buhay, which they allege was due by the deceased to their principal, Telesforo Chuidian, together with interest thereon at the rate of 10 per\u00a0 cent per annum from the\u00a0 9th of February, 1898, when the debt\u00a0 was\u00a0 contracted,\u00a0 and 180.66 pesos in addition thereto on account of a certain\u00a0 commission agreed to in. favor of the creditor, Chuidian.\u00a0\u00a0 Subsequently the last-named amount was remitted, whereby\u00a0 their claim was reduced to the two items first mentioned.<br\/><br\/>The court below ordered the administrator of the estate to pay the sums claimed.\u00a0 The said order is\u00a0 as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"While the court was in full\u00a0 session this administrator admitted the contract which the plaintiff\u00a0 claims had been entered into with the deceased while living.\u00a0 Upon examination of said\u00a0 contract it was shown that Buhay owed the heirs\u00a0 of\u00a0 Chuidian\u00a0 the sum of 2,890.59 pesos and also the sum of 2,910.55 pesos for interest\u00a0 up to the\u00a0 6th of March, 1908,\u00a0 with interest thenceforth on\u00a0 the principal amount at the rate of 10 per cent per annum until payment is made.<br\/><br\/>\"Said\u00a0 contract was made\u00a0 in\u00a0 Mexican currency and it should be converted into Philippine currency at the official ratio\u00a0 established by the Government\u00a0 of the\u00a0 Philippine Islands\u00a0 on this date.<br\/><br\/>\"This claim with respect to\u00a0 the amount already referred to is\u00a0 hereby approved,\u00a0 and\u00a0 the administrator\u00a0 is hereby ordered to pay the said sum immediately.\"<\/blockquote>The plaintiffs excepted to the above order solely in\u00a0 so far as it ordered the conversion of Mexican into Philippine currency at the official ratio which, according to said order, ruled at the time when the order was\u00a0 issued.<br\/><br\/>The fact\u00a0 established by the trial court that the debt had been contracted in Mexican currency is neither denied nor discussed in the brief of the appellants, nor is the propriety of converting the obligation into\u00a0 Philippine currency discussed.\u00a0 The only objection made by them is to the conversion at the official ratio mentioned in the order appealed from, maintaining that it should be done at par.\u00a0 And they allege\u00a0 as a\u00a0 reason and basis for their pretension that the administrator of Buhay's estate made no objection to the admittance\u00a0 of the\u00a0 debt, as it appears in the account marked as Exhibit\u00a0 A (p. 11 of the bill of exceptions), when the matter was\u00a0 brought before the commissioners for appraisal, the amounts being stated therein in figures with the proper sign for Philippine currency.\u00a0 In\u00a0 support of\u00a0 said allegation they insert in their brief a copy\u00a0 of the record of the appearance\u00a0 before the commissioners\u00a0 for appraisal which, among other things, literally reads \"<i>that the administrator admits the document presented by the other party acknowledging at the same time\u00a0 the\u00a0 credit therein stated for<\/i> P2,890.59 3\/8.\"\u00a0 The document herein referred to is the account marked as Exhibit A which has just been mentioned.<br\/><br\/>The record of appearance before the commissioners for appraisal has not\u00a0 been submitted to this\u00a0 court, nor was it made a part of the bill of exceptions which we have before us, for which reason we can not take it into account\u00a0 in rendering a decision in this matter.\u00a0\u00a0 This\u00a0 court can not base its decisions on\u00a0 evidence which is\u00a0 not before\u00a0 it,\u00a0 it being of course the duty of the appellants to\u00a0 take all the necessary steps to have the same submitted to this\u00a0 court in those cases An\u00a0 which is desired, and the\u00a0 law grants, a review of\u00a0 the evidence.<br\/><br\/>As to the rest,\u00a0 if\u00a0 the said document or\u00a0 record of appearance were to be considered, it would be seen that there is nothing therein to support the\u00a0 pretension of the appellants,\u00a0 inasmuch as\u00a0 the\u00a0 figures which represent the amounts are not indicated with the proper sign of the Philippine\u00a0 currency.\u00a0 The Philippine\u00a0 peso is\u00a0 represented\u00a0 by means of this sign: \"P\"\u00a0 (Executive Order\u00a0 No. 66, August 3, 1903), and\u00a0 that\u00a0 used\u00a0 in the above-cited record\u00a0 is this other:\u00a0 \"P;\" this last sign is certainly in use to signify pesos, but\u00a0 pesos in general, not\u00a0 particularly Philippine pesos.<br\/><br\/>The same must be said with respect to the account, Exhibit A, ajid it should further be noted that therein\u00a0 the signs \"$\"\u00a0 and \"P\"\u00a0 are used indiscriminately, which fact shows that the parties did not attach much\u00a0 importance nor pay much attention to the question of signs,\u00a0 apparently considering it as a matter of small\u00a0 consequence.\u00a0 It is well known\u00a0 that\u00a0 the sign\u00a0 \"$\" indicates money\u00a0 of the\u00a0 United States,\u00a0 as recognized in Executive Order\u00a0 No. QQ,\u00a0 above cited.\u00a0\u00a0 It is true, that in the copy of said Exhibit A, which appears at page 11 of the printed bill of exceptions, there appears the sign \"P,\" but this is evidently an error in copying\u00a0 or on the part of\u00a0 the printer, because,\u00a0 in the original (p. 12), the said sign does not appear, but shows the letter \"P.\" Therefore,\u00a0 the\u00a0 allegation of the appellants,\u00a0 which the\u00a0 appellee has denied in his brief, that\u00a0 the latter had agreed to pay the\u00a0 debt in Philippine currency on the basis of one\u00a0 Philippine peso for one Mexican peso, at par,\u00a0 is unfounded.<br\/><br\/>The order appealed\u00a0 from\u00a0 directs a\u00a0 conversion\u00a0 of the Mexican currency into Philippine\u00a0 currency at the\u00a0 official rate established by the Government\u00a0 and in force on the date of said order\u00a0 (March 6, 1908).\u00a0 The\u00a0 order is erroneous and\u00a0 should be revoked.\u00a0 Section 7\u00a0 of the Act of Congress of March 2, 1903, provides as follows:<br\/><br\/>\"That the Mexican silver dollar now in use in the Philippine Islands and the silver coins heretofore issued\u00a0 by the Spanish Government for\u00a0 use\u00a0 in said Islands shall\u00a0 be receivable for public dues at a\u00a0 rate to be fixed from time to time by the\u00a0 proclamation of the\u00a0 Civil\u00a0 Governor of said Islands\u00a0 until such date, not earlier than the first\u00a0 day of January, nineteen\u00a0 hundred and four, as may be fixed\u00a0 by public proclamation of said Civil Governor, when such coins shall cease to be so receivable.\"<br\/><br\/>By virtue of this provision, Executive Order No. 1, dated January 1, 1904, was issued providing that \"The\u00a0 Insular Treasurer and each provincial treasurer in the Philippine Islands shall\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 exchange on demand\u00a0 Philippine currency\u00a0 for said Spanish-Filipino currency <i>at such rates as the Insular Government\u00a0 may, from\u00a0 time to time,\u00a0 determine.\" <\/i><br\/><br\/>Such was the purpose in fixing said rates: that it might serve as a basis or official standard in exchanging at\u00a0 the treasuries the\u00a0 so-called local currency for Philippine currency during the period while the said local currency should be received in payment of dues, it being\u00a0 the duty\u00a0 of\u00a0 the Insular Government to fix the date when it should cease to be so receivable.\u00a0 And the said date was fixed by\u00a0 the Government by Executive Order No. 8 of March 11, 1907, providing that \"from the 1st day of July, 1907, the\u00a0 Insular Treasurer and all provincial treasurers shall cease to redeem the\u00a0 silver coins\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 * *\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Spanish-Filipino,\u00a0 Mexican, etc.).<br\/><br\/>The redemption of the local currency having been thus prohibited, the reason\u00a0 for the official ratio between said currency and the Philippine currency ceased; consequently no official rate of exchange whatever\u00a0 existed on the\u00a0 6th of March, 1908, when the order appealed from was rendered, for the reason that it had\u00a0 been\u00a0 abolished.\u00a0 As no such ratio existed at the time, it can hardly serve as a basis, even though it\u00a0 be supplementary, for the conversion of Mexican into\u00a0 Philippine currency; the order above alluded\u00a0 to can not therefore be sustained with reference to this point.<br\/><br\/>In order that the true equivalent of the\u00a0 two above-mentioned classes of currency may be established, the contending parties should be given an opportunity to present evidence in connection with the matter in the manner provided by section S of Act No. 1045 of the Philippine Commission, inasmuch\u00a0 as the debt was contracted in Mexican currency, and the payment must be ordered in Philippine currency, precisely in accordance with said Act.<br\/><br\/>The order appealed from is hereby set aside in so far as\u00a0 it directs that\u00a0 the\u00a0 amount claimed be converted into Philippine currency at the official ratio said to be ruling on the 6th of March, 1908; a new trial shall be held for the sole purpose of permitting the parties to present evidence as to the actual value of the Mexican money as compared with Philippine currency, which shall serve as a basis for the\u00a0 reduction of the said debt to Philippine\u00a0 currency as must be ordered in the judgment to be rendered. Without special finding as to costs.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson<\/i>, and <i>Carson, JJ.,<\/i> concur.<br\/><\/div>",

Meyers for a loan in the sum of P1,000.\u00a0 As security for payment of the loan, William Thein mortgaged to J. W. Meyers certain furniture owned by him which constitutes the fittings of\u00a0 a saloon situated in Calle Real, No, 124, in the\u00a0 district of Intramuros,\u00a0 Manila, to\u00a0 which effect a public instrument was executed on the 20th of June,\u00a0 1908.<br\/><br\/>The premises at No. 124 Calle Real, district of Intramuros, are owned by Flora Broto, who leased the place to William Thein.\u00a0\u00a0 The latter opened a saloon therein, of which the said furniture formed a part.<br\/><br\/>William Thein, as lessee, was indebted to the lessor, Flora Broto, in the sum of P215, for rent due for the months of June and July, 1908.<br\/><br\/>In the months of June\u00a0 and\u00a0 July, 1908, the furniture in question was in the place\u00a0 leased by William Thein, and, at the request of J. W. Meyers, was removed therefrom by the sheriff,\u00a0 notwithstanding\u00a0 the protest of\u00a0 Flora\u00a0 Broto,\u00a0 the lessor.<br\/><br\/>The said furniture was sold by the sheriff, and the proceeds of the sale amounted to P972.30.<br\/><br\/>Preference with respect to payments to be made from the above sum is claimed on the one hand by J. W.

This\u00a0 is the only question to be resolved in\u00a0 this instance, for the reason that it was the only one decided by the court below.\u00a0 The grounds upon which the trial court has\u00a0 based its opinion\u00a0 are the following:<br\/><ol type=\"1\"><li>That Act No.\u00a0 1508\u00a0 does not repeal the provisions of the Civil\u00a0 Code with respect\u00a0 to this\u00a0 matter, because it does not mention such repeal.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>\u00a0That although the registration of a mortgage or pledge of personal property prejudices a third\u00a0 party, a privileged creditor, such\u00a0 as a\u00a0 lessor claiming\u00a0 the rent for his leased property, who, in law, has a mortgage upon the furniture of the lessee existing upon the premises, can not be considered as such third party, but any other third party by any other title different from that derived from the lease, recognizing no superior claim except one of\u00a0 pledge\u00a0 of personal property, and this only when the property is in the possession of the creditor-pledgee.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>That said privilege or\u00a0 right of retention on the part of the lessor would be vain and illusory\u00a0 if preference were given to a credit secured by a pledge for the mere reason that it was\u00a0 registered, and.such registration would\u00a0 be contrary to the \"right\u00a0 of possession,\" arising by operation of law and in favor of the\u00a0 lessor, over the furniture existing upon the premises leased.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>That it being unnecessary that a legal mortgage, such as that of\u00a0 the lessor, be entered in the registry for\u00a0 the reason that it is created by the law itself, a\u00a0 contractual mortgage can\u00a0 not take\u00a0 preference\u00a0 over it\u00a0 for the\u00a0 mere reason that it\u00a0 is registered.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>That as the debt of the lessee\u00a0 Thein in favor of\u00a0 the lessor Broto bears a date prior to that of the debtor Thein in favor of\u00a0 the creditor-pledgee Meyers, the\u00a0 mortgage created by law in favor of the former became effective before the contractual mortgage; so that, when the latter was registered, the former\u00a0 was already a lien upon the furniture pledged in favor of\u00a0 another.<\/li><\/ol>It becomes necessary to pass upon the nature of the contract of mortgage or pledge of personal property, in accordance\u00a0 with the\u00a0 provisions of section 3 of the said Act No. 1508\u00a0 which prescribes that\u00a0 \"a chattel mortgage is a conditional <i>sale<\/i> of personal property as security for the payment of\u00a0 a\u00a0 debt,\u00a0 or\u00a0 the performance\u00a0 of\u00a0 some other\u00a0 obligation specified therein, the condition being that the sale shall\u00a0 be void\u00a0 upon the\u00a0 seller\u00a0 paying to the purchaser\u00a0 a\u00a0 sum\u00a0 of money or doing some other\u00a0 act named.\u00a0\u00a0 If the condition is performed according to its terms the\u00a0 mortgage and sale immediately become void, and\u00a0 the\u00a0 mortgagee is thereby divested of his title.\"<br\/><br\/>From the language of the law\u00a0 it now appears: (1) That by\u00a0 the\u00a0 operation\u00a0 of Act No. 1508 the\u00a0 actual contract\u00a0 of pledge of the Civil\u00a0 Code degenerates into one of\u00a0 sale by mutual\u00a0 consent; (2) that,\u00a0 under Act No. 1508, a chattel mortgage is a\u00a0 sale with<i> pacto de retro<\/i>, almost equivalent to that\u00a0 under the same name in the Civil Code; (3) that as in\u00a0 a contract of sale with <i>pacto de retro<\/i> where the juridical dominion and possession of the thing sold pass to the purchaser as soon as the sale is consummated,\u00a0 so also in a chattel mortgage the dominion and possession of the mortgaged personal\u00a0 property pass to the creditor-pledgee, because, as the law provides, it is nothing more than a conditional sale; (4) that,\u00a0 in the same manner that a contract of\u00a0 sale\u00a0 is\u00a0 consummated by the\u00a0 delivery, either actual\u00a0 or symbolic,\u00a0 of the thing sold, which symbol of the delivery may be the inscription of the instrument in the registry, so\u00a0 also\u00a0 a chattel\u00a0 mortgage is consummated by a similar delivery, actual\u00a0 or symbolic, by means of an analogous inscription in the\u00a0 registry.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, so long as the\u00a0 mortgage exists, the\u00a0 dominion, with respect to the mortgaged personal property, rests with the creditor-pledgee from the time of the inscription of the mortgage in the registry, and the furniture ceases to be the property of the debtor for\u00a0 the reason that\u00a0 it\u00a0 has become the property of the creditor, in like manner as the dominion of a thing sold is transferred to the purchaser and ceases to belong to the\u00a0 vendor from the moment\u00a0 of\u00a0 the delivery thereof,\u00a0 as\u00a0 a result of\u00a0 the sale.\u00a0\u00a0 According to the Civil Code, a thing given\u00a0 in pledge never\u00a0 becomes the property of\u00a0 the creditor-pledgee;\u00a0 the\u00a0 debtor continues to be\u00a0 the owner thereof (art. 1869); the creditor does not become the owner; he is\u00a0 nothing more than a creditor with a real right over the thing in\u00a0 his possession\u00a0 as a pledge, which he can dispose of through a notary at a public sale according to the Civil Code, the same as the creditor-pledgee may now, under the provisions of Act No. 1508, sell the pledge through the sheriff.\u00a0\u00a0 (Civil Code,\u00a0 1872; Act No. 1508, sec. 14.).<br\/><br\/>In view of the above\u00a0 it must be\u00a0 concluded:\u00a0 (1) That from June 20,1908, the furniture belonging to Thein, which existed in the house leased by Flora Broto, ceased to be the property of the first named and passed to the dominion and juridical possession of J. W.\u00a0 Meyers, the material possession alone continuing in the hands\u00a0 of Thein, and the property actually remaining in the leased\u00a0 building;\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 that when\" the lessor tried to collect the rent due for the months of June\u00a0 and July, 1908, the furniture\u00a0 that existed in the building\u00a0 was no\u00a0 longer the property of the lessee but belonged to a third person who had\u00a0 acquired it as a pledge which, under the law,\u00a0 is a sale, and as\u00a0 such the ownership is transferable, although conditionally and depending upon whether\u00a0 the debtor (the conditional seller)\u00a0 fulfills the condition subsequent, and is\u00a0 similar\u00a0 to a\u00a0 sale with pacto\u00a0 de retro;\u00a0 (3) the preference in the payment of rents due for one year, granted by\u00a0 paragraph 7 of article\u00a0 1922, refers to \"personal property of the\u00a0 lessee;\" hence, as the furniture existing in the house leased no longer belongs to Thein but to J. W. Meyers,\u00a0 according to the public instrument recorded in the public\u00a0 registry, the said right of preference has not existed since the 20th of June, 1908; (4)\u00a0 the registration of a chattel mortgage, executed in accordance with Act No. 1508, is not in violation of the\u00a0 right of possession, supposed to have been acquired ex lege by the lessor over the\u00a0 furniture existing upon the leased premises, because no such right\u00a0 of possession is granted by the law to the lessor over the personal property of the lessee\u00a0 upon the estate leased; it is subject only to the payment of rent for one\u00a0 year, a condition which may become vain and illusory by a transaction\u00a0 like the one now in question, to wit, when the lessee executes a mortgage\u00a0 upon such personal property in favor of a third person, in the same manner as he could have previously performed these or other acts of disposal in respect thereto, inasmuch as his right to dispose of the same was not\u00a0 then, and\u00a0 is not now limited\u00a0 by reason of their being in\u00a0 a\u00a0 leased building; against this contingency the lessor should\u00a0 take proper precautions in order to ensure the payment of rent by means of an express lien thereon, since the personalty is merely affected by a tacit lien under the circumstances presumed by the law, to wit, that it belongs to the lessor and continues upon the premises and is liable only for the rent for one year.<br\/><br\/>The mortgage executed by Thein in favor of Meyers being a valid one, and considering the latter merely as a mortgage creditor (passing over the juridical effects of a sale with which the law has\u00a0 compared\u00a0 a\u00a0 chattel mortgage), he is entitled to have the property\u00a0 sold, as he did,\u00a0 through\u00a0 the sheriff, and to pay\u00a0 himself from the proceeds thereof in preference\u00a0 to subsequent mortgages,\u00a0 in accordance with said\u00a0 section 14 of Act No. 1508.\u00a0 Against this preference, that\u00a0 claimed in this case under paragraph 7 of article 1922 of the Civil Code can not prevail from the moment that it is admitted that,\u00a0 over and above the\u00a0 claim for rerit, that described in paragraph 2\u00a0 of the same article has the superior\u00a0 preference, whenever, in\u00a0 accordance with \/its\u00a0 provisions, the pledge\u00a0 is in the possession of the creditor.\u00a0 The case\u00a0 at bar falls\u00a0 within the circumstances prescribed by section 4 of Act No. 1508 which reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"A chattel mortgage shall not be valid against any person except the mortgagor, his\u00a0 executors\u00a0 or administrators, unless\u00a0 the\u00a0 possession\u00a0 of the property\u00a0 is delivered to and retained\u00a0 by the mortgagee\u00a0 or\u00a0 unless the mortgage is recorded in the office of\u00a0 the register of deeds of the province *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 * .\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The above provision does not, in this respect, repeal paragraph 2 of the said article 1922, but extends the provisions thereof\u00a0 by providing\u00a0 that the property\u00a0 pledged is to be considered\u00a0 as being delivered to the mortgage creditor and to be in his possession, if the mortgage is recorded in the office of the register of deeds of the province.\u00a0 The code only refers to the actual delivery of the pledge; Act No. 1508 provides both for the actual and for the symbolic delivery thereof by means of the registration of the title.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from\u00a0 is\u00a0 reversed, without\u00a0 any special ruling as. to the costs of both instances.<br\/><br\/>It is hereby decided and decreed that, from the proceeds of the sale,\u00a0 preferential payment shall be made to the plaintiff J.\u00a0 W. Meyers; provided, however, that the debtor William Thein\u00a0 alone is adjudged to pay the claim of the latter as prayed for in the complaint.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson,<\/i> and <i>Moreland, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><\/div>",

In recognizing\u00a0 that the plaintiff Jose T. Paterno has legal capacity to bring this action.<br\/><br\/>\"2. In not stating in the judgment the fact or facts considered as proven, in order to sentence the defendant to the payment of the sum of 237,116.85 pesos, as principal, which with interest amounts to 282,564.19 pesos.<br\/><br\/>\"3. In stating that these amounts must be reduced to local currency at the official rate of the Government.<br\/><br\/>\"4, In sentencing the defendant\u00a0 to pay the\u00a0 sum\u00a0 of $519,691.04, that is, to pay, in addition to the amount of the debt, interest at the rate of 10 per cent thereon from the 3d of July, 1896.<br\/><br\/>\"5. In rejecting the evidence offered by the defendant in support of her answer, especially when\u00a0 there was\u00a0 no objection on the part of the other party to its introduction, and in admitting all\u00a0 that adduced by the plaintiff, including Exhibits 6 and 7.<br\/><br\/>\"6. In sustaining the demurrer interposed by the plaintiff to the counterclaim of the defendant.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The first assignment of error is based upon three grounds: First,\u00a0 that the plaintiff being but one of three executors appointed in the will of Maximino M. A. Paterno did not join with him his coexecutors\u00a0 as plaintiffs in this action; second, that the will confers no\u00a0 authority upon the executors to institute or to maintain actions on behalf of the estate; and, third, that the\u00a0 period within which the executors appointed in\u00a0 the will were authorized to represent the estate of the deceased had\u00a0 expired long prior to the institution of this action\u00a0 on July 8,1907, testator having died on the 26th day of July, 1900.<br\/><br\/>Article 895 of the Civil Code is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Should\u00a0 the executors be appointed severally, only those acts performed by all of them\u00a0 together, or by one\u00a0 of them legally authorized by the others, shall be valid; and, in case of disagreement, when the act has been\u00a0 agreed to by the majority.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Plaintiff and his coexecutors were authorized .by the express terms of the will to act as such, jointly and severally, and as appears from\u00a0 a duly executed power of attorney, made a part of the record in this case, plaintiff's coexecutors conferred upon him full and lawful authority to act for and on their behalf in instituting this action.\u00a0 Under the provisions of the\u00a0 above-cited article of the code,\u00a0 we are of opinion that he was clearly entitled to institute and maintain this action without joining his coexecutors with him as parties thereto.<br\/><br\/>The twentieth\u00a0 clause of the\u00a0 last will and testament of Maximino Paterno, deceased, is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"He\u00a0 authorizes his\u00a0 executors, after the\u00a0 death of the grantor, to take possession of his property,\u00a0 to administer it, to\u00a0 demand\u00a0 (<i>reclamar<\/i>), receive, and recover (<i>cobrar)<\/i> everything that may belong to him,\u00a0 to pay his just debts, to issue\u00a0 receipts, orders\u00a0 of payment\u00a0 (<i>cartas\u00a0 de pago<\/i>), cancel mortgages\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 extending the legal term of their appointment for such period as they may require for the fulfillment of their duties.\"<\/blockquote>The authority thus conferred\u00a0 is manifestly sufficient to sustain the right of the executors to institute and maintain an action for the enforcement of\u00a0 a lien to secure a debt due to the estate.\u00a0 The right so to do is a necessary incident of the power to administer the estate of the deceased, and to make demands\u00a0 for (<i>reclamar<\/i>),\u00a0 receive, and recover (<i>cobrar<\/i>) all\u00a0 debts due thereto.\u00a0\u00a0 (Manresa's Commentaries\u00a0 on the Civil\u00a0 Code,\u00a0 vol. 6, third edition, p. 754, discussing the provisions of art. 901 of the Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>The contention\u00a0 of appellant that the period wherein the executors were\u00a0 authorized to act on\u00a0 behalf\u00a0 of\u00a0 the estate had expired\u00a0 prior to\u00a0 the\u00a0 date of the institution of this action, is\u00a0 completely disposed of by\u00a0 an examination of the will itself, which provides\u00a0 that the time limited by law for the administration of the estate by the executors is extended to all the\u00a0 time which might be necessary for the complete performance of their duties (<i>\"prorrogandoles el plazo\u00a0 legal del albaceazgo por el mayor tiempo que necesitaren para el cumplimiento de su cargo\"<\/i>).\u00a0 The provisions of article 904 of the Civil Code,\u00a0 which limit the time within\u00a0 which executors must perform their duties to one year, apply merely to cases where the testator\u00a0 has failed to prescribe the period during which his executors may act, and article 905 clearly provides that when\u00a0 a longer period has been fixed\u00a0 in the will, the provisions\u00a0 of the\u00a0 will prevail.\u00a0 The will having provided that the executors should have all the time necessary, we think that in the absence of objection by\u00a0 those interested in the distribution of the estate, and proof that all the time necessary for its administration by the executors had elapsed, they must be held to have lawfully continued in the exercise 6f their office up to the time\u00a0 of the institution of this action.<br\/><blockquote>\"That law 16, title 10, <i>partida<\/i> 6, and article 904\u00a0 of the Civil Code are not\u00a0 applicable\u00a0 when the testator fixes no term for the appointment of the executors and grants them such ample powers for the whole period as may be\u00a0 necessary for the conclusion of the business intrusted to them.\" (<i>Jurisprudencia Civil,<\/i> vol. 83, of 1898, p. 494,\u00a0 complete compilation, published by the directors of the <i>Revista General de Legislacion y Jurisprudencia.<\/i>)<br\/><\/blockquote>The second assignment of error is\u00a0 not sustained\u00a0 by an examination of the decision\u00a0 itself.\u00a0\u00a0 After setting out that the various public instruments, wherein Gregorio Aguilera, deceased, acknowledged his\u00a0 indebtedness and created the lien which this action was brought to foreclose, were subr mitted without objection on\u00a0 the part of the\u00a0 defendant except upon the technical ground that the plaintiff was not the legal representative of the estate, and that no evidence was introduced by the defendant which tended to establish payment, the trial judge held that \"the principal debt as set\u00a0 out and acknowledged\u00a0 in the instrument creating the lien is 237,116.85 pesos, bearing interest from the 3d day of July, 1896, at the rate of 10 per cent per annum and\u00a0 which interest amounts to\u00a0 date to 282,564.19 pesos.\"\u00a0 This finding is\u00a0 fully supported\u00a0 by\u00a0 an examination of the record, including\u00a0 these public documents,\u00a0 and was\u00a0 a sufficient finding to sustain the judgment declaring the amount of the indebtedness\u00a0 and directing the foreclosure of the lien in the event of the nonpayment of the debt.<br\/><br\/>The third assignment of error based upon the provision contained in the decision of the trial court that the amount of indebtedness set out\u00a0 in his findings of fact should be reduced \"to the value of the present legal tender money of the Philippine Islands at the Government official rate in force this day (the date of the judgment)\" must be\u00a0 sustained, since\u00a0 under the\u00a0 provisions of section 3 of Act No. 1045, it was\u00a0 his\u00a0 duty to \"receive evidence\u00a0 as to the\u00a0 real and just value in Philippine currency of the currency named in the contract, debt, or obligation, including evidence of the local market value of such currency, its value in neighboring\u00a0 countries\u00a0 as\u00a0 currency,\u00a0 its value\u00a0 in the\u00a0 great markets\u00a0 of the world,\u00a0 its\u00a0 bullion value, and any other facts necessary to determine its true value,\" and to give judgment for the amount of the\u00a0 indebtedness thus reduced. The decision of the trial judge should, therefore, be modified by substituting for so\u00a0 much thereof as\u00a0 provides for the reduction\u00a0 of\u00a0 the amount stated in Mexican currency to Philippine currency \"at the Government official rate,\"\u00a0 a provision\u00a0 that the reduction be made\u00a0 in\u00a0 the manner\u00a0 and form prescribed in section 3 of Act No. 1045.<br\/><br\/>The appellant bases his fourth assignment of error upon the construction which he insists should be given the instruments acknowledging the indebtedness and creating the lien, which formally set out\u00a0 that the maker of the instrument, Gregorio Aguilera, is in\u00a0 debt \"to Maximino M. A. Paterno y Yamson two\u00a0 hundred and\u00a0 thirty-seven thousand one\u00a0 hundred\u00a0 and sixteen pesos and\u00a0 eighty-five\u00a0 centimos, which amount will bear interest\u00a0 at the rate\u00a0 of 10 per cent per annum, and he binds\u00a0 himself to pay it within the term of one year from the said day, 21st of April, in the form\u00a0 and under the same conditions stipulated in\u00a0 the\u00a0 original\u00a0 deed of May 27,\u00a0 1891,\u00a0 and\u00a0 specified\u00a0 in the\u00a0 first paragraph hereof.\"<br\/><br\/>Appellant insists that this language\u00a0 is\u00a0 not a stipulation that the principal debt\u00a0 shall bear interest until paid,\u00a0 but merely a\u00a0 stipulation\u00a0 that it shall bear interest from the time of the execution of the instrument until the date when it fell due.\u00a0 We do not think\u00a0 it necessary to waste tim&amp; discussing this contention, as\u00a0 the\u00a0 language of the above citation, taken together with that of the entire instrument wherein it appears, clearly discloses the intention\u00a0 of the parties thereto that the indebtedness acknowledged therein should bear interest, at the rate agreed upon, until paid.<br\/><br\/>The fifth assignment of error is\u00a0 based upon the refusal of the trial court to admit evidence offered by the defendant tending to disclose that a part of the lands upon which the lien was created by Gregorio Aguilera, deceased, was not the property of the deceased, and belongs to the defendant herself in her\u00a0 individual capacity.\u00a0 We think the court properly excluded\u00a0 evidence\u00a0 of this character offered\u00a0 by Catalina Solis as administratrix of the intestate estate of Gregorio\u00a0 Aguilera, deceased.\u00a0 She\u00a0 formally admitted the execution of the instruments creating the lien, wherein the deceased expressly declared\u00a0 that the\u00a0 property in\u00a0 question was his and that he had a right to execute the lien.\u00a0 Clearly neither he nor his personal\u00a0 representative could be heard in an action to enforce the\u00a0 lien thus created to deny the ownership of the property.\u00a0\u00a0 Nor could she be permitted to submit proof of her own. right or title in and to the property in question or any\u00a0 part thereof, since she was not a party to the action in her individual\u00a0 capacity.\u00a0 If she desired to set up an independent individual claim of ownership to part of the property which this action was instituted to foreclose, she should have had herself made a party to the action in her individual capacity, and thus submit her claim in due form for\u00a0 adjudication, at the\u00a0 same time securing relief from the duty of defending\u00a0 this action as administratrix, it appearing that her allegations of ownership of an interest in the land in question\u00a0 are necessarily in conflict with the interests of the estate which she represents in these proceedings.\u00a0\u00a0 We may say, however, that this decision does not absolutely deprive her of her right so to do, since\u00a0 under the provisions of section 121 of the Code of Civil Procedure she may be permitted\u00a0 to intervene in this\u00a0 action at any time prior to the actual foreclosure of the lien and distribution of the proceeds, to assert her right in and\u00a0 to\u00a0 the property in question, and to set up her claim of title in the form and manner\u00a0 prescribed\u00a0 in\u00a0 that\u00a0 section, upon such reasonable conditions as the court may deem proper, in view of her negligence and failure so to do while the action was pending in the court below.<br\/><br\/>Exception was also noted to the action of the trial judge in excluding certain evidence touching\u00a0 the\u00a0 disappearance of the coffee crop in the district wherein the land in question is\u00a0 located, and the consequent inability of the\u00a0 debtor to exercise the election given him to settle his indebtedness in coffee at a\u00a0 stipulated price, but this evidence was\u00a0 so manifestly irrelevant that we do not deem it necessary to discuss the action of the trial court in excluding it.<br\/><br\/>The sixth\u00a0 assignment of error can not be maintained. It is based upon the fact that the trial judge sustained a demurrer to a so-called counterclaim.\u00a0\u00a0 As a counterclaim, this pleading is wholly\u00a0 meaningless, and in so far as it is a mere repetition\u00a0 of the\u00a0 allegations by way of special defense, that part of the property upon which the lien was created by Gregorio Aguilera, deceased, was not his sole property but the property of the defendant, Catalina Solis, in her individual capacity, it has already been shown to\u00a0 be improper.<br\/><br\/>Twenty days hereafter let judgment be entered affirming the judgment of the court below, except in so far as it fixes the rate of exchange for the reduction to Philippine currency of the amount of the indebtedness as\u00a0 stated in\u00a0 Mexican currency, which should\u00a0 be modified by substituting for the rate of exchange indicated\u00a0 in the judgment a rate\u00a0 of\u00a0 exchange to be ascertained in\u00a0 accordance with the provisions of section 3 of Act No. 1045; and let\u00a0 the judgment thus entered further direct the return of the\u00a0 record in ten days from the date of entry of said judgment to the court\u00a0 below, where\u00a0 the proper proceedings will\u00a0 be had to ascertain the rate of exchange on the day of the former judgment, and an order entered modifying the former judgment\u00a0 accordingly.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><br\/><i>Arellano,\u00a0 C.

Upon a consideration of the facts adduced during the trial of the cause the justice of the peace dismissed said\u00a0 action. From this judgment of the justice of the peace the plaintiff appealed to the Court of First Instance of said province.<br\/><br\/>The cause was finally heard by the judge of the Court of First Instance.\u00a0 After hearing the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause, said judge found from a preponderance of the evidence that the defendants had been in possession of the land for more than one year\u00a0 prior to the time of the commencement of the action in the court of the justice of the peace and, applying the provisions of section 80 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions, decided that the action was improperly commenced before the justice of the peace; that the justice of the peace did not have jurisdiction to try said cause; that an action of forcible entry and detainer can not be commenced in the\u00a0 court of a justice of the peace where the defendants have been in\u00a0 possession of the\u00a0 land for a period of more than one year prior to the commencement of the action.\u00a0 From\u00a0 this judgment the plaintiff appealed to this court and made the following assignments of error:<br\/><blockquote>\"1.

The court erred in denying the motion for new\u00a0 trial filed by the appellant.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>With reference to the first assignment of error, the lower court did not decide that the plaintiff was not entitled to the possession of the land\u00a0 in question.\u00a0\u00a0 The decision\u00a0 of the lower court\u00a0 was to the effect that an action for\u00a0 the possession of the land in question could not be maintained in the court of the justice of\u00a0 the peace for the reason that more than one year had elapsed after the alleged illegal possession and before the commencement of the action.\u00a0\u00a0 It is possible that in an action\u00a0 of ejectment, commenced\u00a0 in\u00a0 the proper court, the plaintiff may be able to show that he is entitled to the possession of the land in question.<br\/><br\/>We deem\u00a0 it unnecessary to discuss the second and third assignments of error above noted for the reason\u00a0 that the court, not having jurisdiction over the action, could not decide whether or not the plaintiff was entitled to\u00a0 damages for the illegal possession of said land.<br\/><br\/>The action being one for forcible entry and detainer, commenced in the court of the justice of the peace, could not be changed to an\u00a0 action\u00a0 of ejectment by an\u00a0 amendment\u00a0 of the pleadings in the Court of First Instance.\u00a0\u00a0 (Alonso <i>vs.<\/i> Municipality of Placer, 5 Phil.

That on July 6, 1907, the plaintiff applied to the municipality of Romblon requesting that a parcel of land or building lot owned by the said municipality be\u00a0 sold to him at the rate of one\u00a0 peso per square meter; the description of the same is as follows:<br\/><br\/>\"A parcel of land with an area of 469 square meters, the limits and boundaries of which are: On the north\u00a0 the road that leads to Bagacay or the walk to the pier; on the south the convent walls; on the east the\u00a0 plaza 'Libertad;' and on the west the mountain called 'Santiago.'<br\/><br\/>\"2. That on the 8th of the said month of July, 1907, the council of said municipality of Romblon agreed to the sale requested by the plaintiff and resolved to sell him said land at the rate of one peso per square meter.<br\/><br\/>\"3.\u00a0 That when said resolution was submitted to the provincial governor of Romblon, Senor Bonifacio Marron, the sale thereof was authorized on the 12th of the aforesaid month of July, 1907, but at the rate of one peso and twenty centavos\u00a0 (P1.20) per square meter,\u00a0 for\u00a0 the reason that according to the last assessment the latter was the assessed value of the land, not one peso only.<br\/><br\/>\"4.\u00a0 That said\u00a0 modification in the price was accepted by the municipal council of Romblon and by the plaintiff, and at the session held by the council on the 15th of July, 1907, the execution of the bill of sale in favor of the plaintiff was agreed to.<br\/><br\/>\"5.\u00a0 That at the session held by the said municipal council of Romblon on the 31st of July, 1907, it resolved to authorize the municipal\u00a0 president, Sr.\u00a0 Juan Mazo,\u00a0 to execute said bill of sale in favor of the plaintiff for the price of\u00a0 P1.20 for each square\u00a0 meter,\u00a0 in accordance with the authority granted by the ex-provincial governor of Romblon on July 12,1907.<br\/><br\/>\"6. That on\u00a0 the day after the resolution of the 31st of July, 1907, was taken by the municipal council, the protest of several residents\u00a0 of Romblon, against the\u00a0 resolution of the municipal council in\u00a0 connection with the\u00a0 sale of said land to Sr. Alfredo Chanco, the plaintiff, was forwarded to the provincial board of Capiz.<br\/><br\/>\"7. That the provincial board of Capiz,\u00a0 at\u00a0 its sitting of August 5, 1907, resolved to annul the resolution of the municipal council\u00a0 of Romblon\u00a0 of July 8, 1907; with reference to the sale of said lot to Sr. Alfredo Chanco.<br\/><br\/>\"8. That by reason of the consolidation of the two Provinces of Capiz and Romblon, the latter becoming a sub-province from the 15th of July, 1907, the provincial board of Capiz took charge of all matters intrusted to the abolished provincial board of Romblon.<br\/><br\/>\"9. That the said\u00a0 resolution of the provincial board of Capiz of August 5, 1907, was, on the 9th of said month and year, transmitted\u00a0 by wire to the municipal council of Romblon through the\u00a0 lieutenant-governor, and,\u00a0 in view of said resolution of the\u00a0 provincial\u00a0 board of Capiz, the municipal council of Romblon, at its sessions of the\u00a0 12th, 15th, and 30th of August, 1907, resolved to annul its own resolution of the 8th of July, 1907.\"<\/blockquote>Upon this agreed\u00a0 statement of facts, the trial court gave judgment in favor of the defendants for costs, from which judgment plaintiff appealed.<br\/><br\/>In his brief, counsel for appellant makes but one assignment of error, as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"The court below erred in dismissing the complaint, inasmuch as the contract involved\u00a0 in this case is valid and binding.\"<\/blockquote>The judgment of the trial\u00a0 court is based upon\u00a0 the provisions of section 1 of Act No. 676, amending section\u00a0 41\u00a0 of the Municipal Code\u00a0 (in force at the time when the above set-out transactions took place, but\u00a0 itself amended by the provisions of Act No, 1791), which is as follows:<br\/><br\/>\"Section forty-one of Act\u00a0 Numbered Eighty-two, known as the Municipal Code, is hereby amended by striking out all of the\u00a0 section as\u00a0 it appears in the Act, and substituting in lieu thereof the following:<br\/><blockquote>\"'SEC.\u00a0 41. Whenever the council is desirous of securing a legal opinion\u00a0 upon questions arising in\u00a0 relation to the constitution or attributes of the municipal\u00a0 government, it shall frame the questions\u00a0 in writing and\u00a0 submit them\u00a0 to the provincial fiscal for decision.\u00a0 It shall\u00a0 be the duty\u00a0 of the secretary of\u00a0 the municipal council to forward, immediately after their passage, certified copies of all resolutions, ordinances,\u00a0 and other acts\u00a0 of the municipal council to the provincial\u00a0 governor.\u00a0 It shall\u00a0 be the duty of the president\u00a0 of each municipality whenever he makes a formal executive\u00a0 order which is published, to direct the\u00a0 municipal secretary\u00a0 to\u00a0 forward a certified copy of the same to the governor of the province.\u00a0\u00a0 In case the governor shall think it probable that any act, ordinance,\u00a0 or resolution of the municipal council, or any executive order of the municipal president is not within its or his legal power, as conferred by the Municipal Code and its amendments, he shall bring the same to the attention\u00a0 of the provincial board, which shall\u00a0 request the opinion of the provincial fiscal as to the validity of the act, ordinance, resolution, or order\u00a0 in question,\u00a0 and if, after receiving the opinion of the provincial fiscal, the\u00a0 board shall conclude that such act, ordinance, resolution, or executive order is in violation of the powers conferred by\u00a0 the\u00a0 Municipal Code upon\u00a0 the council or the president making the same, the provincial board shall have the power,\u00a0 and it shall be its duty, to declare such act, ordinance, resolution, or executive order\u00a0 to be null and void, and shall immediately\u00a0 notify the\u00a0 council or the president, as the case may be, of its action.\u00a0\u00a0 Any\u00a0 attempt to enforce such\u00a0 act, ordinance, resolution, or executive order, after the provincial board shall have declared it to be null and after\u00a0 the action of the provincial board\u00a0 shall be brought to the attention of the municipal authorities, shall be sufficient ground for the dismissal of the officer or officers attempting to enforce the same.\u00a0 Should the council or the president be dissatisfied\u00a0 with the decision\u00a0 of the provincial board, an appeal may be taken by it or by him to the Civil Governor, who shall decide the same\u00a0 question which was presented to the provincial board and either affirm or reverse the decision of the provincial board.\u00a0 If\u00a0 the decision of the provincial board is affirmed, the act, ordinance, resolution, or executive order involved\u00a0 shall be annulled.\u00a0 If, however, he shall reverse the decision of the provincial board,\u00a0 then and in that case notice\u00a0 of his decision shall be given to the provincial governor, to the\u00a0 president or\u00a0 council of the municipality appealing, and upon receipt of notice by the appellant, the act, ordinance, resolution, or executive order ghall\u00a0 be revived and come into\u00a0 force again.\u00a0 Pending the decision on appeal from an order of the provincial board annulling any act, ordinance, resolution,\u00a0 or executive order the same shall have no force and effect.\u00a0 Nothing in this section shall be construed to deprive any judicial tribunal of power to hold void for want of statutory authority any act,\u00a0 ordinance, or resolution of a municipal council or executive order of a municipal president the validity of which shall be involved in\u00a0 any cause arising before such tribunal, without respect to\u00a0 the\u00a0 decision of the\u00a0 executive\u00a0 authorities.'\"<\/blockquote>Section 41 of Act\u00a0 No.\u00a0 82, thus amended, is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Questions\u00a0 which may arise\u00a0 relative to the constitution or attributes\u00a0 of the municipal government\u00a0 shall be\u00a0 submitted to the provincial\u00a0 fiscal for decision.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Counsel for appellant insists that this section does not authorize the\u00a0 provincial board to declare null and void resolutions or acts\u00a0 of the\u00a0 municipal\u00a0 council whereby the council undertakes\u00a0 to exercise authority vested in it by subsection (c) of section 40 of the Municipal Code, which empowers the municipal council \"to purchase, receive, hold, sell,\u00a0 lease, convey, and\u00a0 dispose of property, real and\u00a0 personal, for the benefit of the municipality,\u00a0 provided\u00a0 that the express authorization of the provincial governor shall be necessary\u00a0 to alienate or constitute any lien upon any real\u00a0 property of the municipality.\"\u00a0 Counsel urges that the \"acts, ordinances, and resolutions\" of the municipal council which may be declared null and void under the provisions of section 41, as\u00a0 amended, should be construed so as to include those\u00a0 only of a\u00a0 legislative or\u00a0 administrative character,\u00a0 and not those of a\u00a0 contractual nature,\u00a0 adopted in pursuance of the authority conferred under subsection (c) of section 40 of the\u00a0 Municipal\u00a0 Code.\u00a0 But we find nothing in the\u00a0 provisions of law above cited which\u00a0 supports the contention of\u00a0 appellant's counsel,\u00a0 and indeed, section 41 of the Municipal Code, as amended, following, as it does, immediately after sections 39 and 40 wherein the duties and powers of the municipal council are enumerated, and containing no provision excepting any particular class of acts, ordinances, or resolutions,, clearly indicates the intention of the legislator to confer authority upon the various provincial boards upon the terms and conditions set out in the amended section, to declare null\u00a0 and void\u00a0 all acts, ordinances,\u00a0 and resolutions of municipal councils,\u00a0 and executive\u00a0 orders\u00a0 of municipal presidents, of every kind and character whatsoever.<br\/><br\/>Counsel contends, further, that\u00a0 since there was no\u00a0 provision of\u00a0 law requiring the express approbation of acts, ordinances, and resolutions of municipal councils by their respective provincial boards, at the time when those transactions took place, all such acts, ordinances, and resolutions must be taken to\u00a0 be valid and of binding force and effect, until and\u00a0 unless\u00a0 they are expressly and formally\u00a0 disapproved by the provincial board;\u00a0 and that the municipality of Romblon having\u00a0 obligated itself to sell the land in question by a valid resolution, of binding force and effect, is not relieved of its obligation so to do by the fact that thereafter the\u00a0 resolution was annulled.\u00a0 But while it is\u00a0 true that prior to the enactment of Act No. 1791 there was no express provision of law\u00a0 for the\u00a0 approbation of such acts, ordinances, and resolutions by the provincial board, it is clear that under the provisions of section 41 of the Act, as amended by Act No. 676, such acts, ordinances, and\u00a0 resolutions were always adopted\u00a0 (so long\u00a0 as the provisions of the latter\u00a0 Act were in force) subject to\u00a0 the invalidating action of the provincial board, and that all persons dealing with the municipal\u00a0 council or in any wise affected\u00a0 by its acts, ordinances, and resolutions must be taken to\u00a0 have\u00a0 had knowledge of that fact.\u00a0\u00a0 The agreement of the municipality to sell the land in question, so far as its resolutions\u00a0 can properly be said to constitute an agreement, must, therefore, be taken to have been subject to the implied\u00a0 condition that the agreement would be invalidated in the event that before it was actually executed the provincial board should\u00a0 annul the resolution.\u00a0 As\u00a0 disclosed by the\u00a0 agreed statement of facts, the resolution was in fact annulled before the agreement was\u00a0 executed, and plaintiff's claim of specific performance can not therefore be maintained.<br\/><br\/>It may be admitted that in some cases great inconvenience and embarrassment might\u00a0 have arisen from the exercise by provincial boards of the\u00a0 authority conferred upon the under section 41 of the code, as amended\u00a0 by Act No. 676, to annul resolutions of a contractual nature adopted by municipal councils, but such considerations address themselves to the legislature rather than to the courts, except in cases where they may become important\u00a0 in construing doubtful and uncertain language of a statute.\u00a0 And it is worthy of observation that the Commission in amending the provisions of this section by the enactment of\u00a0 Act\u00a0 No. 1791, appears to have been fully cognizant of its defective character, and to have sought to remedy its defects by the passage of the amendments therein contained.<br\/><br\/>It\u00a0 is contended, however,\u00a0 that the only ground upon which the provincial board was authorized to annul a resolution of the municipal council was that it was in violation of the\u00a0 powers\u00a0 conferred by the Municipal\u00a0 Code upon\u00a0 the council, and that the\u00a0 resolution in question\u00a0 having been clearly within the powers\u00a0 conferred\u00a0 upon the municipal council by the provisions of subsection\u00a0 (c) of section 40,the provincial\u00a0 board\u00a0 had no authority to annul it.\u00a0\u00a0 It is to be observed, however, that the provisions of section 41 of the code, as\u00a0 amended by section\u00a0 1\u00a0 of Act No. 676, authorize and make it a duty of the provincial board to' declare acts, ordinances, or resolutions of municipal councils\u00a0 null and void when \"the board shall conclude\u00a0 that such act, ordinance, or resolution, or executive order is in violation\u00a0 of the\u00a0 powers\u00a0 conferred by the Municipal\u00a0 Code upon\u00a0 the council or the president making the same.\"\u00a0\u00a0 And it is clear that it was the intention of the lawmaker that except in case of administrative appeal by the council, such action when taken\u00a0 by the provincial board\u00a0 should have the\u00a0 effect\u00a0 of annulling the act, ordinance, or resolution against which it was directed, whether the board erred or not in the\u00a0 conclusions upon which it based its action.\u00a0 It is not suggested, nor does it appear from the agreed statement of facts, that when the annulling resolution of the provincial\u00a0 board was adopted,\u00a0 the board neglected or failed to comply\u00a0 with the provisions of section 41, as amended by Act No.\u00a0 676, in the proceedings had in this connection, and its action, therefore, must be taken to have been had in conformity with and in pursuance of the provisions of law investing it with authority to annul resolutions of the municipal council.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i> Arellano, C.

The question there litigated\u00a0 was the claim upon the part of the municipality\u00a0 of\u00a0 ownership of said church and\u00a0 its appurtenances\u00a0 on the ground\u00a0 that\u00a0 according\u00a0 to Spanish law the Roman\u00a0 Catholic Apostolic Church was not the owner of such property, having only\u00a0 the use\u00a0 thereof for ordinary ecclesiastical and religious purposes, and that the true owner thereof was the\u00a0 municipality or the State by reason of the contributions by\u00a0 them, or by the people, of the land and of the\u00a0 funds with which the buildings were constructed or repaired.\u00a0 The\u00a0 court decided in that case that the claim of the\u00a0 defendants was not well founded and that the property belonged to the Roman Catholic Church. The same question was discussed and\u00a0 decided\u00a0 in the case of Barlin\u00a0 <i>vs.<\/i> Ramirez (7 Phil.\u00a0 Rep., 41), and\u00a0 the case of The Municipality of\u00a0 Ponce vs. Roman Catholic Apostolic Church in Porto Rico (28 Sup. Ct.\u00a0 Rep., 737,\u00a0 6 Off. Gaz., 1213).<br\/><br\/>We have made a careful examination of the\u00a0 record and the evidence in this\u00a0 case and we have no doubt that the property sued fdr was, at\u00a0 the\u00a0 time it was taken by the defendants,\u00a0 the property of the Roman Catholic Church, and\u00a0 that the seizure\u00a0 of the\u00a0 same and occupation of\u00a0 the church\u00a0 and\u00a0 its appurtenances\u00a0 by\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendants\u00a0 were wrongful and illegal\u00a0 We are\u00a0 also convinced,\u00a0 from\u00a0 such examination, that the conclusions of the court below\u00a0 as to the value\u00a0 of the articles\u00a0 taken by the defendants and of the rent of the church for\u00a0 the\u00a0 time of its illegal occupation by the defendants were correct and proper.\u00a0 While some objection was\u00a0 made on appeal by\u00a0 counsel for\u00a0 the\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 defendants\u00a0 that\u00a0 the value\u00a0 of the articles\u00a0 taken\u00a0 and of the rent of the church and its appurtenances had not been proved\u00a0 by competent\u00a0 evidence,\u00a0 no objection to the introduction of the evidence\u00a0 of value was made at the trial and\u00a0 we can not consider\u00a0 that question raised for the first time here.<br\/><br\/>We have\u00a0 carefully examined the assignments of error made by\u00a0 counsel for the defendants on this appeal.\u00a0 We find\u00a0 none of them well founded.\u00a0 The only one which deserves especial attention\u00a0 at our hands is the one wherein the defendants assert that\u00a0 the\u00a0 court\u00a0 below erred\u00a0 in permitting the action to be brought and continued in the name of the plaintiff\u00a0 instead of\u00a0 in the name of the bishop of the diocese\u00a0 within\u00a0 which the\u00a0 church was located, or in the name of\u00a0 the Roman Catholic Apostolic\u00a0 Church, as the real\u00a0 party in interest.<br\/><br\/>It is\u00a0 undoubted that the bishop of the\u00a0 diocese or the Roman\u00a0 Catholic Apostolic Church itself is the\u00a0 real party in interest.\u00a0\u00a0 The plaintiff\u00a0 personally has\u00a0 no\u00a0 interest in the cause of action.\u00a0 Section\u00a0 114 of the\u00a0 Code\u00a0 of Civil Procedure requires that every action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest.\u00a0 The plaintiff is not such party.<br\/><br\/>Section 110 of the\u00a0 Code of\u00a0 Civil Procedure, however, provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"Sec. 110. <i>Amendments\u00a0 in\u00a0 general<\/i>. - The court shall, in furtherance of justice, and on such terms,\u00a0 if\u00a0 any, as may be proper,\u00a0 allow a party to amend any pleading or proceeding and at any stage of the\u00a0 action, in\u00a0 either the Court of First Instance or the Supreme Court,\u00a0 by adding or striking out the name of any party,\u00a0 either plaintiff or defendant, or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistaken or inadequate allegation or description in any\u00a0 other respect,\u00a0 so that the actual\u00a0 merits of the controversy\u00a0 may speedily be\u00a0 determined,\u00a0 without regard to technicalities, and in the\u00a0 most expeditious and inexpensive\u00a0 manner.\u00a0 The court\u00a0 may also, upon like terms, allow an\u00a0 answer or\u00a0 other\u00a0 pleading to be\u00a0 made\u00a0 after the time limited by the rules of the court for filing the same.\u00a0 Orders of the court upon the matters provided in this section shall be\u00a0 made upon\u00a0 motion filed\u00a0 in court, and\u00a0 after notice\u00a0 to the adverse party,\u00a0 and an opportunity to be heard.\"<\/blockquote>Section 503\u00a0 of the same code provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"SEC. 503. <i>Judgment\u00a0 not to be reversed\u00a0 on technical grounds.<\/i> - No judgment shall be reversed on formal or technical\u00a0 grounds,\u00a0 or\u00a0 for such error\u00a0 as has\u00a0 not\u00a0 prejudiced the real rights of\u00a0 the excepting party.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>We\u00a0 are confident under these provisions\u00a0 that this court has full power, apart\u00a0 from that power and authority which is inherent, to\u00a0 amend the process,\u00a0 pleadings, proceedings, and decision in this case by substituting, as party plaintiff, the real party in interest.\u00a0\u00a0 Not only\u00a0 are we confident that we\u00a0 may do so,\u00a0 but\u00a0 we are convinced\u00a0 that we should do so. Such\u00a0 an amendment\u00a0 does not constitute, really, a change in the identity\u00a0 of the parties.\u00a0 The plaintiff asserts in\u00a0 his complaint,\u00a0 and maintains that assertion all\u00a0 through the record, that he is engaged in the prosecution of this case, not for himself, but for the bishop of the diocese - not by his own right,\u00a0 but\u00a0 by right of another.\u00a0\u00a0 He seeks merely to do for the bishop what the bishop\u00a0 might do for himself. His own personality\u00a0 is not involved.\u00a0\u00a0 His\u00a0 own rights are not presented.\u00a0 He claims no interest whatever in the litigation.\u00a0\u00a0 He seeks only the welfare of the great church whose servant he is.\u00a0\u00a0 He\u00a0 gladly permits his identity to be wholly swallowed\u00a0 up in that of his superior.\u00a0 The\u00a0 substitution, then,\u00a0 of the name of the\u00a0 bishop\u00a0 of the diocese,\u00a0 or the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church, for that of Padre Alonso, as party plaintiff, is not in reality\u00a0 the substitution of one identity for\u00a0 another, of one\u00a0 party\u00a0 for another,\u00a0 but\u00a0 is simply to make the form express the\u00a0 substance.\u00a0 The substance is there.\u00a0 It appears all through the\u00a0 proceedings. No\u00a0 one is\u00a0 deceived for\u00a0 an instant as to whose interests are at stake.\u00a0 The form of its expression is alone defective. The substitution,\u00a0 then,\u00a0 is\u00a0 not\u00a0 substantial\u00a0 but\u00a0 formal. Defect in mere form can not possibly prejudice so long as the substantial is clearly evident.\u00a0 Form\u00a0 is a method of speech used to express substance and make\u00a0 it clearly appear.\u00a0 It is\u00a0 the means\u00a0 by which the\u00a0 substance\u00a0 reveals itself.\u00a0 If the form\u00a0 be faulty and still\u00a0 the\u00a0 substance\u00a0 shows plainly through, no harm can come by making the form accurately expressive of the substance.<br\/><br\/>No one has been\u00a0 misled\u00a0 by the error in the name\u00a0 of the party plaintiff.\u00a0\u00a0 If we should by reason of this error send this\u00a0 case back for amendment\u00a0 and new trial, there would be on the retrial the same complaint, the same answer, the same defense, the same interests, the same witnesses, and the same\u00a0 evidence.\u00a0 The name of the plaintiff would constitute the only difference between the old trial and the new. In our judgment there is not\u00a0 enough in\u00a0 a name to justify such action.<br\/><br\/>There is nothing sacred about processes or pleadings, their forms or contents.\u00a0 Their sole purpose is to facilitate the application of justice to the rival claims of contending parties. They were created, not to hinder and delay, but to facilitate and promote, the administration of justice.\u00a0\u00a0 They do not constitute the thing itself, which courts are always striving to\u00a0 secure\u00a0 to litigants.\u00a0 They are designed as the\u00a0 means best\u00a0 adapted to obtain\u00a0 that thing.\u00a0 In other words, they are a means to an end. (When they\u00a0 lose the character\u00a0 of the one and become the other,\u00a0 the administration of justice is at fault and courts are correspondingly remiss\u00a0 in the performance of their obvious\u00a0 duty.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 error in this case is purely technical.\u00a0 To take advantage of it for other purposes than to cure itrdoes not appeal to a fair sense of justice.\u00a0 Its presentation as fatal to the plaintiff's case smacks of skill rather than right.\u00a0\u00a0 A litigation is not a game of technicalities in which one, more deeply schooled and skilled in the subtle art of movement and position, entraps and destroys the other.\u00a0\u00a0 It is,\u00a0 rather, a contest in which each contending party fully and fairly lays before the court the facts in issue and then, brushing aside as wholly trivial and indecisive all imperfections of form and technicalities of procedure, asks that justice be done upon the merits.\u00a0 Lawsuits, unlike duels, are not to be won by a rapier's thrust.\u00a0 Technicality, when it deserts its proper office as an.aid to justice and becomes its great hindrance\u00a0 and chief\u00a0 enemy, deserves scant consideration from courts.\u00a0 There should be no vested rights in technicalities.\u00a0 No litigant should be permitted to challenge a record of a court of these Islands\u00a0 for\u00a0 defect of form when his substantial\u00a0 rights have not\u00a0 been prejudiced thereby.<br\/><br\/>In ordering this substitution, we are in accord with the best judicial thought,\u00a0\u00a0 (McKeighan <i>vs.<\/i> Hopkins, 19 Neb., 83;\u00a0 Dixon <i>vs<\/i>.

No large cattle shall be slaughtered or killed for food at the municipal slaughterhouse except upon\u00a0 permit secured from the municipal treasurer.\u00a0 Before\u00a0 issuing the permit for the slaughter of large cattle for human consumption, the municipal treasurer shall require for branded cattle the production of the original certificate of ownership and certificates of transfer showing title in the person applying for the permit, and for unbranded cattle such evidence as may satisfy\u00a0 said treasurer\u00a0 as\u00a0 to the\u00a0 ownership\u00a0 of\u00a0 the animals for which permit to slaughter has been requested.<br\/><br\/>\"SEC. 31. No permit to\u00a0 slaughter carabaos shall\u00a0 be granted by the municipal treasurer unless such animals are unfit for agricultural work or for draft purposes, and in no event shall a\u00a0 permit\u00a0 be given to\u00a0 slaughter for food any animal of any kind which is not fit for human consumption.<br\/><br\/>\"SEC. 32. The municipal treasurer shall keep a record of all permits for slaughter issued by\u00a0 him, and such record shall show the name and residence of the owner,\u00a0 and the class, sex, age, brands, knots of radiated hair commonly known as remolinos or cowlicks, and other marks of identification of the animal for the slaughter of which permit is issued and the date on which such permit is issued.\u00a0 Names of owners shall\u00a0 be alphabetically arranged in the record, together with\u00a0 date of permit.<br\/><br\/>\"A copy of\u00a0 the record of permits\u00a0 granted for slaughter shall be forwarded monthly to the provincial treasurer, who shall file and properly index the same under the name of the owner, together with date of permit.<br\/><br\/>\"SEC. 33. Any person\u00a0 slaughtering or\u00a0 causing to be slaughtered for human\u00a0 consumption\u00a0 or killing for food at the municipal\u00a0 slaughterhouse any large cattle\u00a0 except upon permit duly secured from the municipal treasurer,\u00a0 shall be punished by a fine of not less\u00a0 than ten nor more than five hundred pesos, Philippine currency, or by\u00a0 imprisonment for not\u00a0 less than one month nor more than six months, or by both such fine and imprisonment, in the discretion of the court.\"<\/blockquote>It is contended that the proper construction of the language of these provisions limits the prohibition contained in section 30 and the penalty imposed in section 33 to cases (1) of slaughter of large cattle for human consumption <i>in a municipal slaughterhouse <\/i>without a permit duly secured from the municipal treasurer, and\u00a0 (2) cases of killing of\u00a0 large cattle for food <i>in\u00a0 a\u00a0 municipal slaughterhouse <\/i> without a permit duly secured from the municipal treasurer; and it is urged that the municipality of Carmen not being provided with a municipal slaughterhouse, neither the prohibition nor the penalty is applicable to cases of slaughter of large cattle without a permit in that municipality.<br\/><br\/>We are of opinion, however, that the prohibition contained in section\u00a0 30 refers (1) to the slaughter of\u00a0 large cattle for human consumption, anywhere, without a permit duly secured from\u00a0 the municipal treasurer, and (2) expressly and specifically to the killing for food of large cattle at a municipal slaughterhouse without such permit; and that the penalty provided\u00a0 in\u00a0 section 33 applies\u00a0 generally to the slaughter of large\u00a0 cattle\u00a0 for human consumption, anywhere, without a permit duly secured from the municipal treasurer, and specifically to the killing for food of large cattle at a municipal\u00a0 slaughterhouse without\u00a0 such permit.<br\/><br\/>It may be admitted at once, that the pertinent language of these\u00a0 sections taken by itself and examined\u00a0 apart\u00a0 from the context fairly admits of two constructions: one whereby the phrase \"at the municipal slaughterhouse\" may be taken as limiting\u00a0 and restricting both the\u00a0 word \"slaughtered\" and the words \"killed for food\" in section 30, and the words \"slaughtering or causing to be slaughtered\u00a0 for human consumption\" and the words \"killing for food\" in\u00a0 section 33; and the other whereby\u00a0 the\u00a0 phrase\u00a0 \"at\u00a0 the\u00a0 municipal slaughterhouse\" may\u00a0 be\u00a0 taken as limiting and restricting merely the words \"killed for food\" and \"killing for\u00a0 food\" as used in those sections.\u00a0 But upon a reading of the whole Act, and keeping in mind the manifest and expressed purpose and object of its enactment, it is very clear that the latter construction is that which should be adopted.<br\/><br\/>The Act primarily seeks to protect\u00a0 the \"large cattle\" of the Philippine Islands against theft and to make easy the recovery and\u00a0 return of such cattle to\u00a0 their proper owners, when lost, strayed, or stolen.\u00a0 To this end it provides an elaborate and compulsory system for the separate branding and registry of ownership of all such cattle throughout the Islands, whereby owners are enabled\u00a0 readily and easily to establish their title; it prohibits and invalidates all transfers of large cattle unaccompanied\u00a0 by certificates of transfer issued by the proper officer in the municipality\u00a0 where the contract of sale is made; and it provides also for\u00a0 the disposition of estrays and animals recovered from the possession of thieves or persons unlawfully in possession, so as to protect the rights of the true owners.\u00a0 All this, manifestly, in order to make\u00a0 it difficult for any\u00a0 one but the\u00a0 rightful owner of such cattle to retain them in his possession or to dispose of\u00a0 them to\u00a0 others.\u00a0 But the usefulness\u00a0 of this elaborate and compulsory system of identification, resting as it does on\u00a0 the official registry of the brands and marks on each separate animal throughout the Islands, would be largely impaired, if not totally destroyed, if\u00a0 such\u00a0 animals were permitted to be slaughtered for\u00a0 human consumption without requiring proof of ownership and the production of certificates\u00a0 of registry by the person\u00a0 slaughtering or causing them to be slaughtered, and this especially if the animals were\u00a0 slaughtered\u00a0 privately\u00a0 or in a\u00a0 clandestine manner, outside of a municipal slaughterhouse.\u00a0 Hence, as it would appear, sections 30 and 33 prohibit and penalize the slaughter for human consumption or killing for food at a municipal slaughterhouse of such animals without a permit issued by the\u00a0 municipal\u00a0 treasurer, and section\u00a0 32 provides\u00a0 for the keeping of detailed records of all such permits in the office of the municipal and also of the provincial treasurer.<br\/><br\/>If, however, the construction be placed on these sections which\u00a0 is contended for by the appellant, it will readily be seen that all these carefully worked out provisions for the registry and record of the brands and marks of identification of all large cattle in the Islands would prove in large part abortive, since thieves and persons unlawfully in possession of such\u00a0 cattle could, and naturally would, evade the provisions of the law\u00a0 by slaughtering them outside of municipal slaughterhouses, and thus enjoy the fruits of their wrongdoing without exposing themselves\u00a0 to the danger of detection incident\u00a0 to\u00a0 the bringing\u00a0 of\u00a0 the animals to the public slaughterhouse, where the brands and other identification marks might be scrutinized and proof of ownership required.<br\/><br\/>Where the language of a statute\u00a0 is fairly susceptible of two or\u00a0 more constructions,\u00a0 that\u00a0 construction should\u00a0 be adopted which will most tend to give effect to the manifest intent of the lawmaker and promote the object for which the\u00a0 statute was enacted, and\u00a0 a construction should\u00a0 be rejected which would\u00a0 tend to render abortive other provisions of the statute and to\u00a0 defeat\u00a0 the object which\u00a0 the legislator sought to attain\u00a0 by its enactment.\u00a0\u00a0 We are\u00a0 of opinion, therefore,\u00a0 that sections 30 and 33 of the Act prohibit and\u00a0 penalize the\u00a0 slaughtering\u00a0 or\u00a0 causing to\u00a0 be slaughtered for\u00a0 human consumption\u00a0 of large cattle at any place without the permit provided for in section 30.<br\/><br\/>It is\u00a0 not essential that an explanation be found for the express prohibition in these sections\u00a0 of the \"killing for food at a municipal slaughterhouse\" of such animals, despite the fact that this prohibition is clearly included in the general prohibition\u00a0 of the\u00a0 slaughter\u00a0 of such animals for\u00a0 human consumption anywhere; but it is not improbable\u00a0 that the requirement for the issue of\u00a0 a\u00a0 permit in such cases\u00a0 was expressly and specifically mentioned out of superabundance of precaution, and to avoid all possibility of misunderstanding in the event that some of the municipalities should be disposed to modify or vary the general provisions of the law by the passage\u00a0 of local ordinances or regulations\u00a0 for the control of municipal slaughterhouses.<br\/><br\/>Similar reasoning applied to the specific provisions of section\u00a0 31 4)f the Act leads\u00a0 to the same conclusion.\u00a0 One of the secondary\u00a0 purposes of the law, as set out in that section, is to prevent the slaughter for food of carabaos fit for agricultural and draft purposes, and of all animals unfit for human consumption.\u00a0 A construction which would limit the prohibitions and\u00a0 penalties prescribed in the\u00a0 statute to the killing of such animals\u00a0 in municipal slaughterhouses, leaving unprohibited and unpenalized their slaughter outside of such establishments, so manifestly tends to defeat the purpose and^object of the legislator, that unless imperatively demanded by the language of the\u00a0 statute it should\u00a0 be rejected; and, as we\u00a0 have already indicated, the language of the\u00a0 statute is clearly susceptible\u00a0 of\u00a0 the construction which we have placed upon it, which tends to make effective the provisions of this as well as\u00a0 all the\u00a0 other sections of the Act.<br\/><br\/>It appears\u00a0 that the defendant\u00a0 did\u00a0 in\u00a0 fact apply\u00a0 for a permit to slaughter his carabao, and that it was denied him on the\u00a0 ground that the animal was not unfit \"for agricultural\u00a0 work or for draft purposes.\"\u00a0 Counsel\u00a0 for\u00a0 appellant contends that the statute, in so far as it undertakes to penalize the slaughter of carabaos for human consumption as food, without first obtaining a permit which can not be procured in the event that the animal is not unfit \"for agricultural work or for draft purposes,\" is unconstitutional and in violation of the terms of section 5\u00a0 of the Philippine Bill\u00a0 (Act of\u00a0 Congress, July 1,\u00a0 1902),\u00a0 which provides that \"no law shall be enacted which shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.\"<br\/><br\/>It is not quite clear from the argument of counsel whether his contention is\u00a0 that this provision of the statute constitutes a taking of property for public use1 in the exercise of the right of eminent domain <i>without providing for the compensation of the\u00a0 owners<\/i>, or that it\u00a0 is an undue and unauthorized exercise of the police power of the State. But whatever may be the basis\u00a0 of\u00a0 his\u00a0 contention, we are of opinion, appropriating, with necessary modifications understood, the language of that great jurist, Chief Justice\u00a0 Shaw (in the case of Com. <i>vs<\/i>. Tewksbury, 11 Met., 55, where the question involved was the constitutionality\u00a0 of a\u00a0 statute prohibiting and penalizing the taking or carrying away by any person, including the owner, of any stones, gravel, or sand, from any of the beaches in the town of Chelsea), that the law in question \"is not a taking of\u00a0 the property for public use, within the meaning of the constitution, but is a just and legitimate exercise of the power of the legislature to regulate and restrain such particular use of the property as would be inconsistent with or injurious to the rights of the public.\u00a0 All property is acquired and\u00a0 held under the tacit\u00a0 condition that it shall\u00a0 not be so used as to injure the equal rights of others or greatly impair\u00a0 the\u00a0 public rights and interests of the community.\"<br\/><br\/>It may be conceded that the beneficial use and exclusive enjoyment of\u00a0 the\u00a0 property\u00a0 of\u00a0 all carabao\u00a0 owners in these Islands is to\u00a0 a greater or less degree interfered with\u00a0 by the provisions of the statute;\u00a0 and that, without inquiring what quantum of interest thus passes from the owners of such\u00a0 cattle, it is an interest\u00a0 the\u00a0 deprivation of which detracts from\u00a0 their right and authority, and in some degree interferes with their\u00a0 exclusive possession\u00a0 and control\u00a0 of their\u00a0 property, so\u00a0 that if the regulations\u00a0 in question were enacted for purely private purposes, the statute, in so far as these regulations are concerned, would be a violation of the provisions of the Philippine Bill relied on by appellant; but we are satisfied that it is\u00a0 not such a\u00a0 taking, such an interference with the\u00a0 right and title of the owners, as is involved in the exercise by the State of the right of eminent domain, so as\u00a0 to entitle these owners to compensation, and that it is no more than \"a just restraint\u00a0 of an injurious private use of the\u00a0 property,\u00a0 which\u00a0 the\u00a0 legislature\u00a0 had authority to impose.\"<br\/><br\/>In the case of Com. <i>vs.<\/i>\u00a0 Alger (7 Cush., 53, 84), wherein the doctrine laid down in Com.\u00a0 <i>vs.<\/i> Tewksbury (<i>supra<\/i>)\u00a0 was reviewed and affirmed, the same eminent jurist\u00a0 who wrote the former opinion,\u00a0 in distinguishing the exercise\u00a0 of the right of eminent domain from the exercise of the sovereign police powers of the State, said:<br\/><blockquote>\"We\u00a0 think it is\u00a0 a settled principle, growing out of the nature\u00a0 of well-ordered civil\u00a0 society, that every holder of property, however absolute and unqualified may be his title, holds it under the implied liability that his use of it may be so regulated that it shall not be injurious to the equal enjoyment of others having an equal right to the enjoyment of their property, nor injurious to the rights of the community. *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 Rights of property, like all other social and conventional rights, are subject to such reasonable limitations in their enjoyment\u00a0 as\u00a0 shall prevent them from being injurious, and to such reasonable restraints and regulations established by law, as the legislature, under\u00a0 the governing and\u00a0 controlling\u00a0 power vested\u00a0 in\u00a0 them by the constitution, may think necessary and expedient.<br\/><br\/>\"This is very different from the right of eminent domain, the right of a government to take and appropriate private property to public use, whenever the public exigency requires it; which can be done only on condition of providing a reasonable compensation therefor.\u00a0 The power we allude to is rather the police power, the\u00a0 power vested\u00a0 in the legislature by the constitution, to make, ordain, and establish all manner of wholesome and reasonable laws, statutes, and ordinances, either with penalties or without, not repugnant to the constitution, as they shall judge to be for the good and welfare of the commonwealth, and\u00a0 of the subjects of the same.<br\/><br\/>\"It is much easier to perceive\u00a0 and realize the existence and sources of this\u00a0 power than to mark its\u00a0 boundaries or prescribe limits to its exercise.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Applying\u00a0 these\u00a0 principles,\u00a0 we are of opinion that\u00a0 the restraint placed by the law on the slaughter for human consumption of carabaos fit for agricultural work and draft purposes is not\u00a0 an appropriation of property\u00a0 interests to a \"public use,\" and is not, therefore, within\u00a0 the principles of the exercise by the State of the right\u00a0 of eminent domain. It is in fact a mere restriction or limitation upon a private use, which the legislature\u00a0 deemed to be detrimental to the public welfare.\u00a0 And we think that an examination of the general provisions of the\u00a0 statute\u00a0 in\u00a0 relation to the public interests which it seeks to safeguard and the public necessities for which it provides, leaves no room for doubt that the limitations\u00a0 and restraints imposed upon the exercise of rights of ownership by the particular provisions of the statute under consideration were\u00a0 imposed not for private purposes\u00a0 but,\u00a0 strictly,\u00a0 in\u00a0 the promotion of\u00a0 the\u00a0 \"general welfare\" and\u00a0 \"the public\u00a0 interest\" in\u00a0 the exercise\u00a0 of the sovereign police power which\u00a0 every State possesses for the general public welfare and which \"reaches to every species of property within the commonwealth.\"<br\/><br\/>For several years prior to\u00a0 the enactment of the statute a virulent\u00a0 contagious or infectious disease had\u00a0 threatened the total extinction of carabaos in these Islands,\u00a0 in many sections sweeping away seventy, eighty, and in some cases as much as ninety and even one hundred per\u00a0 cent of these animals.\u00a0 Agriculture\u00a0 being\u00a0 the\u00a0 principal occupation\u00a0 of the people, and the carabao being the work animal almost exclusively in use in the fields\u00a0 as well as for draft purposes, the ravages of the disease with which they\u00a0 were infected struck an almost vital blow at the material welfare of the country.\u00a0 Large areas\u00a0 of productive land lay waste for years, and the production of rice, the staple food of the inhabitants of\u00a0 the Islands, fell off to such an extent\u00a0 that the impoverished\u00a0 people were compelled to\u00a0 spend many millions of pesos\u00a0 in its\u00a0 importation, notwithstanding the fact that with sufficient work animals to cultivate the fields the arable rice lands of\u00a0 the country could easily be made to produce a supply more than sufficient for its own needs. The drain upon the resources\u00a0 of the Islands was such\u00a0 that famine soon\u00a0 began to make\u00a0 itself felt, hope sank in the breasts of the people, and in many provinces the energies of the breadwinners seemed to be paralyzed by the apparently hopeless struggle for existence with which they were\u00a0 confronted.<br\/><br\/>To meet these conditions, large sums of money were expended by the Government in relieving the immediate needs of the starving people, three millions of dollars were voted by the Congress of the United States as a relief or famine fund, public works were undertaken to furnish employment in the provinces where the need was most pressing, and every effort made to alleviate the suffering incident to the widespread failure of the crops throughout the Islands, due in large measure to the lack of animals fit for agricultural work and draft purposes.<br\/><br\/>Such measures, however,\u00a0 could only temporarily relieve the situation, because in an agricultural community material progress and permanent prosperity could hardly be hoped for in the absence of the work animals upon which such a community must necessarily rely for the cultivation of the fields and\u00a0 the transportation of the products of the\u00a0 fields to market.\u00a0 Accordingly efforts were made by the Government to increase the supply of these animals by importation, but, as appears from the official reports on\u00a0 this subject, hope for the future depended largely on the conservation\u00a0 of those animals which had been spared from the ravages\u00a0 of the disease, and their redistribution throughout the Islands where the need for them was greatest.<br\/><br\/>At large expense,\u00a0 the services of experts were employed, with a view to the discovery and application of preventive and curative remedies, and it is hoped that these measures have\u00a0 proved\u00a0 in some degree successful\u00a0 in\u00a0 protecting the present inadequate supply of large cattle, and that the gradual increase and redistribution of these animals throughout the Archipelago, in response\u00a0 to\u00a0 the operation of the laws of supply\u00a0 and demand,\u00a0 will ultimately result in practically relieving those sections which suffered most by the loss of their work animals.<br\/><br\/>As was to be expected under such conditions, the price of carabaos rapidly increased from three to five fold or more, and\u00a0 it may fairly be presumed\u00a0 that\u00a0 even if the conservative\u00a0 measures\u00a0 now adopted prove entirely successful, the scant supply will keep the price of these animals at a high figure until the natural increase shall have more nearly equalized the supply to the demand.<br\/><br\/>Coincident with and probably intimately connected with this sudden rise\u00a0 in\u00a0 the price of cattle, the crime of cattle stealing became extremely prevalent throughout the Islands, necessitating the enactment of a special law penalizing with the severest penalties\u00a0 the theft of carabaos and other personal property by roving\u00a0 bands; and it\u00a0 must be assumed from the\u00a0 enactment\u00a0 of the statute\u00a0 under consideration that the legislative authority found that the general welfare of the\u00a0 Islands necessitated\u00a0 the\u00a0 enactment of special and somewhat burdensome provisions for the\u00a0 branding and registration of large cattle, and the supervision and restriction of their slaughter for food.\u00a0 It\u00a0 will hardly be questioned that the provisions of the statute touching the branding and registration of such\u00a0 cattle, and prohibiting and penalizing the\u00a0 slaughter of diseased cattle for food were enacted in the\u00a0 due and proper exercise of the police power of the State; and we are of opinion that,\u00a0 under all the circumstances, the provisions of the\u00a0 statute prohibiting and penalizing the slaughter for human consumption of carabaos fit for work were in like manner\u00a0 enacted in the due and proper exercise of that power, justified by\u00a0 the exigent necessities of existing conditions, and the right\u00a0 of the State to protect itself against the overwhelming disasters incident to the further\u00a0 reduction of the\u00a0 supply of\u00a0 animals fit for agricultural work or draft purposes.<br\/><br\/>It is, we think, a fact of common knowledge in these Islands, and disclosed by the official reports and records of the administrative and legislative departments of the Government, that not merely the material welfare and future prosperity of this agricultural community were threatened by the ravages of the\u00a0 disease which swept away the work animals during the years prior to the enactment of the law under consideration, but that the very life and existence\u00a0 of the inhabitants of these Islands as a civilized people would be more or less imperiled by the continued destruction\u00a0 of large cattle by disease or otherwise.\u00a0 Confronted by such conditions, there can be no doubt of the right of the Legislature to adopt reasonable measures for the preservation of work animals, even to the extent of prohibiting and penalizing what would, under ordinary conditions, be a perfectly legitimate and proper exercise\u00a0 of rights of ownership and control of the\u00a0 private property\u00a0 of the citizen.\u00a0\u00a0 The police power rests upon necessity and\u00a0 the right of self-protection, and if ever the invasion of private property by police regulation can be justified, we think that the reasonable\u00a0 restriction placed upon the use of carabaos by the provision of the law under discussion must be held to be authorized as a reasonable and proper exercise of that power.<br\/><br\/>As stated by Mr. Justice Brown in his opinion in the case of Lawton vs. Steele\u00a0 (152 U. S., 133, 136):<br\/><blockquote>\"The extent and limits of what is known as the police power have been a fruitful subject of discussion in\u00a0 the appellate\u00a0 courts of nearly every\u00a0 State in the Union. It is universally conceded\u00a0 to include\u00a0 everything essential to the public safety, health,\u00a0 and morals, and to justify the destruction or abatement, by summary proceedings, of whatever may be regarded as a public nuisance.\u00a0 Under this power it has been held that the State may order the destruction of a house falling to\u00a0 decay or otherwise endangering the lives of passers-by;\u00a0 the demolition of such\u00a0 as are in the path of\u00a0 a\u00a0 conflagration; the slaughter\u00a0 of diseased\u00a0 cattle;\u00a0 the destruction of decayed or\u00a0 unwholesome\u00a0 food; the prohibition of wooden buildings in cities; the regulation\u00a0 of railways and other means of public conveyance,\u00a0 and of\u00a0 interments in burial grounds; the restriction of objectionable trades to certain\u00a0 localities; the compulsory vaccination of children; the confinement of the\u00a0 insane or those\u00a0 afflicted with contagious diseases; the restraint\u00a0 of\u00a0 vagrants, beggars, and habitual drunkards; the suppression of obscene publications and houses of\u00a0 ill fame; and the prohibition of gambling houses\u00a0 and places where\u00a0 intoxicating\u00a0 liquors are sold. <i>Beyond this, however, the State may. interfere\u00a0 wherever the public interests demand it, and in this particular a large discretion is necessarily vested in the legislature to determine, not only what the interests of the public require, but what measures are necessary for the protection of such interests.\u00a0 <\/i> (Barbier <i>vs<\/i>. Connolly, 113 U. S., 27; Kidd <i>vs.<\/i> Pearson, 128 U. S,,\u00a0 1.)\u00a0 To justify the State in thus interposing its authority in behalf of the public, it must appear, first,\u00a0 that the interests of the public\u00a0 generally, as distinguished from those of a particular class, require such interference; and, second, that the means are reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of the purpose, and not unduly\u00a0 oppressive upon individuals.\u00a0 The\u00a0 legislature may not, under\u00a0 the guise\u00a0 of protecting the\u00a0 public\u00a0 interests, arbitrarily\u00a0 interfere with\u00a0 private business, or impose unusual and unnecessary restrictions upon lawful occupations. In other words, its determination as to what is a proper exercise of\u00a0 its police powers is not\u00a0 final or conclusive, but is subject to the supervision of the courts.\"<\/blockquote>From what has been said, we think it\u00a0 is clear that the enactment of the provisions of the statute under consideration was required by \"the interests of the\u00a0 public generally, as distinguished from those of a particular class;\" and that the prohibition of the slaughter of carabaos for human consumption, so long as these animals\u00a0 are fit for agricultural work or draft purposes was a \"reasonably necessary\" limitation on private ownership, to protect the community from the loss of the services of such animals by their slaughter by improvident owners, tempted either by greed of momentary gain, or by a desire to enjoy the luxury of animal food, even when by so doing the productive power of\u00a0 the community may be measurably and dangerously affected.<br\/><br\/>Chief Justice\u00a0 Redfield, in\u00a0 Thorpe <i>vs<\/i>. Rutland &amp; Burlington R. R. Co.\u00a0 (27 Vt., 140), said\u00a0 (p. 149)\u00a0 that by this \"general police\u00a0 power of the State, persons and\u00a0 property are subjected to\u00a0 all kinds of restraints and burdens, in order to secure the general comfort, health, and prosperity of the State; of the perfect right in the legislature to do which, no question ever was,\u00a0 or, upon acknowledged and general principles, ever can be\u00a0 made, so far as natural persons are concerned.\"<br\/><br\/>And Cooley in his\u00a0 \"Constitutional Limitations\" (6th ed., p. 738) says:<br\/><blockquote>\"It would be quite impossible\u00a0 to enumerate all the instances in which the police power is or may be exercised, because\u00a0 the\u00a0 various cases in which\u00a0 the exercise by one individual of his rights may conflict with a\u00a0 similar exercise by\u00a0 others, or may be\u00a0 detrimental to the\u00a0 public order or safety, are infinite in number and in variety.\u00a0 And there are other cases where\u00a0 it becomes necessary for\u00a0 the public authorities to interfere with\u00a0 the\u00a0 control by individuals of their property,\u00a0 and even to destroy it, where the owners themselves have fully\u00a0 observed all\u00a0 their\u00a0 duties to their fellows and to the State, but where, nevertheless, some controlling\u00a0 public necessity\u00a0 demands the\u00a0 interference or destruction.\u00a0 A strong instance of this\u00a0 description is where it becomes necessary to take, use, or destroy the private property of individuals to prevent the spreading of a fire, the ravages\u00a0 of a pestilence, the advance of a hostile army, or any other great public calamity.\u00a0\u00a0 Here the\u00a0 individual is in no\u00a0 degree in fault,\u00a0 but his\u00a0 interest must yield\u00a0 to that 'necessity' which 'knows no\u00a0 law.'\u00a0 The\u00a0 establishment of limits\u00a0 within\u00a0 the denser portions\u00a0 of\u00a0 cities and\u00a0 villages within which buildings constructed of inflammable materials shall not be erected or repaired may also, in some\u00a0 cases, be equivalent to a destruction of private property; but regulations for this purpose have been sustained notwithstanding this\u00a0 result.\u00a0\u00a0 Wharf lines may also be\u00a0 established for the general good, even\u00a0 though they prevent the owners of water-fronts\u00a0 from\u00a0 building out on soil which constitutes private property.\u00a0 And, whenever the\u00a0 legislature deem it necessary to the protection of a harbor to forbid the removal of stones, gravel, or sand from the beach, they may establish regulations to that effect under\u00a0 penalties, and make them applicable to the owners of the soil equally with other persons.\u00a0 Such regulations are only 'a just restraint of an injurious use of property, which the legislature have authority' to impose.<br\/><br\/>\"So a particular use of property may sometimes be forbidden, where, by a change of circumstances, and without the fault of the owner, that which was once lawful, proper, and unobjectionable\u00a0 has now become\u00a0 a public\u00a0 nuisance, endangering the\u00a0 public health or the public safety.\u00a0 Milldams\u00a0 are sometimes destroyed upon\u00a0 this ground;\u00a0 and churchyards which prove, in the advance of urban population, to be detrimental to the public health, or in danger of becoming so, are liable to be closed against further use for cemetery purposes.\"<\/blockquote>These citations from some of the highest judicial and text-book authorities\u00a0 in the United States clearly indicate the wide scope and extent\u00a0 which has there\u00a0 been\u00a0 given to the doctrine of the\u00a0 sovereign police power of the State, and confirm us in\u00a0 our opinion that the provision of the statute in question being a proper exercise of that power\u00a0 is not in violation of the terms of section 5 of the Philippine Bill, which provide that \"no law shall be enacted which shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or\u00a0 property without due process of law,\"\u00a0 a\u00a0 provision which itself is\u00a0 adopted from the Constitution of the United States, and is found in substance in the\u00a0 constitution of most if\u00a0 not all of the\u00a0 States of the Union.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of conviction and the sentence imposed by the trial court should be affirmed\u00a0 with the costs of\u00a0 this instance against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

I., knowingly and unlawfully, kept, possessed, and\u00a0 held in\u00a0 their\u00a0 possession and\u00a0 under\u00a0 their control, eleven (11) pills of opium and about two (2) grams of prepared\u00a0 opium, the said\u00a0 accused not being officers of the Government, nor having a legal\u00a0 permission from\u00a0 the Collector of Internal Revenue, nor being licensed physicians, all contrary to law,\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Go Chingco on his plea of guilty\u00a0 was convicted and sentenced to\u00a0 pay a fine of P125.\u00a0 Lim\u00a0 Chingco entered a plea of not guilty, but was nevertheless convicted\u00a0 and sentenced to pay a fine of P200.\u00a0\u00a0 Go Chingco\u00a0 did not appeal, and the action is\u00a0 before\u00a0 us now\u00a0 upon the single\u00a0 appeal of Lim Chingco.<br\/><br\/>On the\u00a0 28th of March,\u00a0 1909, W. M. Paterson,\u00a0 an agent of the Internal Revenue Department, found a small quantity of opium\u00a0 and an opium-pipe cleaning instrument in\u00a0 the store of the defendant, Lim Chingco.\u00a0 Paterson\u00a0 filed a complaint against Lim Chingco in the court of the justice of the peace of Albay, wherein a preliminary investigation was\u00a0 held.\u00a0\u00a0 Lim Chingco upon being asked whether he was guilty or net guilty replied that he was guilty in that\u00a0 the said\u00a0 opium and opium-pipe cleaner were found in\u00a0 his store, but that they did not belong to him and were the property of his employee, Go Chingco.\u00a0\u00a0 Thereupon Go\u00a0 Chingco's name was inserted, together with\u00a0 Lim Chingco's, in\u00a0 the complaint, and he,\u00a0 upon being examined\u00a0 by the justice of the peace, admitted that the\u00a0 opium and pipe cleaner were his property.<br\/><br\/>At the trial in the Court of First Instance, W. M. Paterson,\u00a0 the internal-revenue agent who found the\u00a0 opium and pipe\u00a0 cleaner in the store of Lim Chingco, and Juan de Mata, the auxiliary justice of the peace, were the only witnesses who\u00a0 testified for the prosecution.<br\/><br\/>The first of these witnesses, W. M. Paterson, testified, in part, as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Q. Was it you who filed a complaint with the court of the justice of the peace against Lim Chingco? - A. Yes.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. And did you accuse him alone first? -\u00a0 A. Yes, sir.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. And why did you accuse Go Chingco later on? - A. Because, when he was asked\u00a0 whether or not he was guilty at the court of the justice of the peace, he replied 'guilty,' saying that the apparatus for opium and the other utensils belonged to his clerk, and\u00a0 that he knew that his clerk used these things.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. And was it Go Chingco\u00a0 who said that he was\u00a0 the owner of\u00a0 those articles? - A. Yes.\u00a0 Then I requested\u00a0 the court to include Go Chingco in that case.\"<\/blockquote>The second witness, Juan de Mata, testified as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"On account of the motion\u00a0 presented by the complaining witness, the accused, after pleading guilty, made the additional statement that he is guilty because the corpus delicti was found in his store but that it did not belong to him, and he\u00a0 says that he is guilty because it was found in his store, but that it was not his property; and that when the complaining witness learned these\u00a0 words of the Chinaman, he told me that the Chinaman was guilty as charged because the said property was found in his\u00a0 store, but that it did not belong to him; and then I asked the complaining witness who was the owner, and he then made the\u00a0 motion\u00a0 asking for the\u00a0 inclusion of the Chinaman\u00a0 Go Chingco in the complaint, and thereupon the motion was properly granted and I\u00a0 afterwards\u00a0 ordered\u00a0 the president\u00a0 to arrest\u00a0 the\u00a0 other Chinaman, and, when\u00a0 arrested,\u00a0 the latter was taken into the court and was instructed concerning the rights the law grants to him,\u00a0 and I read to him the complaint in Spanish and translated it for him into Bicol, asking him if he understood it, to which he\u00a0 answered affirmatively; and\u00a0 then I asked him\u00a0 whether or\u00a0 not he was\u00a0 guilty and he answered that he\u00a0 was guilty because the property belongs to him.\"<\/blockquote>The appellant testifying in his own behalf admitted that the witness Paterson had found the opium and pipe cleaner in his store,\u00a0 but\u00a0 alleged that\u00a0 they were not his property but the\u00a0 property\u00a0 of his employee,\u00a0 Go Chingco, and in explanation of his alleged plea of \"guilty\" in the court of the justice of the peace said that he did not declare\u00a0 himself to be guilty of the crime as charged, but that he admitted that he was guilty of having the opium and pipe cleaner in his store, but explained that\u00a0 they were\u00a0 not his\u00a0 property\u00a0 but the property of his employee, Go Chingco; and that\u00a0 he knew that they were\u00a0 the property of\u00a0 Go\u00a0 Chingco,\u00a0 not because\u00a0 he had any knowledge of the fact that Go Chingco had them in his\u00a0 possession before they\u00a0 were\u00a0 seized\u00a0 but because\u00a0 when Paterson discovered them and asked who was the owner, Go Chingco replied that\u00a0 they were his.\u00a0 Go Chingco, testifying as a witness, corroborated all that was said by\u00a0 the appellant, and again admitted that the\u00a0 opium and pipe cleaner were his exclusive\u00a0 property.<br\/><br\/>We do not think that the testimony sustains the judgment of conviction of\u00a0 the\u00a0 appellant\u00a0 by the trial\u00a0 court.\u00a0 The evidence\u00a0 of record\u00a0 does not sustain\u00a0 a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant, Lim Chingco, was in possession of the opium and pipe cleaner at\u00a0 the time when these articles were used.\u00a0 It is true that their\u00a0 discovery in his store tends\u00a0 to raise a presumption, <i>prima facie<\/i>, that these goods were in his possession and under his control, but the uncontradicted evidence of record conclusively establishes that the seized articles were in fact the property of Go Chingco, and that they were at the time of their seizure in his exclusive possession, and\u00a0\u00a0 that\u00a0 the\u00a0 appellant,\u00a0 Lim Chingco, had no knowledge of the fact that his employee, Go Chingco, had these articles in his possession or control.<br\/><br\/>The following citation from the decision\u00a0 in the case of The United States <i>vs.<\/i>\u00a0 Tan Tayco and\u00a0 Co Sencho\u00a0 (12 Phil. Rep.,\u00a0 739),\u00a0 wherein\u00a0 the facts were somewhat analogous to those set out in\u00a0 the record in this case, is directly in point, and decisive as to the innocence of the accused of the offense with which he is charged (p. 743):<br\/><blockquote>\"Possession has been defined to be the detention or enjoyment\u00a0 of a thing which a man holds or exercises by himself or\u00a0 by another\u00a0 who keeps or exercises it\u00a0 in his name. (Bouvier's\u00a0 Law Dictionary, Rawles's Revision, Vol. II.) Clearly it involves a state of mind on\u00a0 the part of the possessor whereby he intends to exercise and, as a\u00a0 consequence of which, he does exercise a right of possession, whether that right be legal or otherwise; and while the intention and the will to\u00a0 possess may be,\u00a0 and usually are, inferred from\u00a0 the\u00a0 fact that the thing in\u00a0 question is\u00a0 under the apparent\u00a0 power and control of the alleged possessor, nevertheless, the existence of the <i>animus possidendi <\/i>is subject to contradiction, and may be rebutted by evidence\u00a0 which tends to prove that the person under\u00a0 whose power\u00a0 and control the thing in question appears to be, does not in fact exercise such power of control\u00a0 and does\u00a0 not intend\u00a0 so to\u00a0 do.\u00a0\u00a0 In order to complete a\u00a0 possession, two things are required -\u00a0 that there be an occupancy,\u00a0 apprehension, or taking;\u00a0 that the taking be with an intent to possess (animus possidendi). Hence, persons who have no legal wills,\u00a0 as children of insufficient\u00a0 understanding\u00a0 and\u00a0 idiots,\u00a0 can not\u00a0 possess or acquire a complete possession (Pothier, Etienne, see 1 Mer., 358; Abb. Sh., 9); so where stolen property is placed in the house or upon the premises of A, without his knowledge or consent, A is not properly\u00a0 speaking in possession of such property, so long as he does not assert a right to its control, and is not moved by the <i>animus possidendi<\/i> with reference thereto.<br\/><br\/>\"The statements of the\u00a0 witness Avila, if they\u00a0 can be believed, furnish\u00a0 a full, satisfactory, and\u00a0 sufficient explanation of the presence of the utensils for smoking opium in his\u00a0 house at the time of their seizure,\u00a0 which is\u00a0 entirely consistent with the allegations of the\u00a0 defendant that those utensils Were not at that time\u00a0 in\u00a0 their possession; and, therefore, entirely consistent with the innocence of\u00a0 the defendants charged with a violation of the\u00a0 provisions\u00a0 of the above-cited section of the Opium Act.\"<\/blockquote>The judgment of conviction of the appellant, Lim Chingco, and the\u00a0 sentence imposed\u00a0 upon\u00a0 him by the trial court should be, and are hereby, reversed, with his share\u00a0 of the costs in both instances <i>de oficio,<\/i>\u00a0 and the appellant is acquitted of the offense with which he is charged.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i> Arellano,\u00a0 C.

W. Frield, wherein he alleged: That he was the owner and proprietor of a parcel of land at the place called Cababalahan, barrio of Santa Filomena, pueblo of Uigan, of the said district, Moro Province,\u00a0 bounded on the north by the land of Can dido Molo, on the east by Government land, on the south by the land of Gregorio Manaloto, and on the west by the seashore, having an area of 72 hectares, approximately, and planted with fruit\u00a0 trees; that the plaintiff mortgaged the said property for P400 for an unspecified\u00a0 period and without interest, in favor of Carloto Jariol y Agana, from whom he received the said\u00a0 sum upon the condition that, should he return it,\u00a0 together with the expenses incurred in the improvement of the land, the mortgagee would return the property to\u00a0 the mortgagor, the\u00a0 plaintiff;\u00a0 that the plaintiff demanded from Carloto Jariol,\u00a0 and afterwards from Alejandro Jariol, the return of the said\u00a0 land and offered to pay to them the said sum and to refund the expenses incurred when duly verified by vouchers and other requisites; that after the lapse of the time necessary to enable the plaintiff to require the fulfillment of the agreement, he learned from trustworthy sources that Alejandro Jariol, Carloto's son, had conveyed the said property to Gregorio Nanaman and the latter to the American, Abae or Abaid; that by the defendants' refusal to transfer to the plaintiff the property mentioned, he failed\u00a0 to collect the fruits produced by the land and\u00a0 thereby suffered loss and damages to the\u00a0 extent of P200;\u00a0 that the plaintiff believed that his property was in danger of\u00a0 being lost\u00a0 or materially\u00a0 damaged\u00a0 unless a receiver should be appointed for its care, preservation, and administration during the course of the litigation, and for this purpose he offered to give bond to respond for all loss and\u00a0 damage which might be caused to the defendants by\u00a0 reason of the receivership and any action taken by the receiver, in case it should finally be determined that there was not sufficient ground for such receivership;\u00a0 that the plaintiff would deposit with the clerk pf the court the sum of P400, the amount of the mortgage on the land, at the disposal of the defendants, and he prayed that a receiver be appointed for the land described, after the execution of such bond as might\u00a0 be required of him, and that, in case\u00a0 any transfer or conveyance of the property had been made, the\u00a0 instruments whereby the same was effected be declared null and void.<br\/><br\/>It was further prayed in the complaint that the defendants, or whoever held the land through the latter, be ordered to return the\u00a0 same, together with all its\u00a0 trees, fruits, and buildings, to the plaintiff, and that the said P400, so deposited, be delivered to Carloto Jariol\u00a0 y\u00a0 Agana, to his heirs and successors in interest, and that the defendants\u00a0 or\u00a0 the persons who gave rise to this suit, be sentenced to pay P200 as an\u00a0 indemnity for loss and\u00a0 damage, and\u00a0 the\u00a0 costs.\u00a0 It was further petitioned that a person chosen by the plaintiff be appointed, after acceptance of\u00a0 the bond\u00a0 offered,\u00a0 as receiver with orders to take charge of the property.<br\/><br\/>The defendants, M. W.\u00a0 Prield, Leandro Jariol, and Gregorio Nanaman, on August 14, 1909,\u00a0 filed,\u00a0 through their counsel, an amended answer to the complaint\u00a0 and set forth: That they withdrew their demurrer, and admitted paragraph 1\u00a0 of the complaint; that\u00a0 they denied\u00a0 each and all\u00a0 of the other paragraphs\u00a0 of the same, and, as a\u00a0 special defense, alleged: That, on April 6,\u00a0 1906, the plaintiff Carlos Martell Ong unconditionally sold\u00a0 to Carloto Jariol\u00a0 the\u00a0 aforesaid land, as shown in the instrument ratified on the same date before the notary\u00a0 public of Iligan; that on July 25, 1908, by an instrument ratified on the same date before the said notary, Leandro\u00a0 Jariol and Tomasa Sabilla, son and widow, respectively, of the deceased Carloto Jariol,\u00a0 sold the said land outright to Gregorio\u00a0 Nanaman who,\u00a0 in turn, on February 6, 1909, sold it to another of the defendants, M. W. Frield, for Pl,200, according to the instrument ratified\u00a0 on the same date before the notary above referred to; that the plaintiff Martell y Ong filed a complaint on September 2, 1908, before the justice of the peace for the recovery from the defendant Leandro Jariol, Carloto's son, of the sum of P200 as loss and damage caused by the latter's having sold the land to another person, and that a judgment favorable to the plaintiff was rendered with costs; that the said Leandro Jariol, before selling the land to Gregorio Nanaman, offered it to Carlos Martell y Ong, who did not wish to pay more than P300 for it; that the improvements made thereon, from the 6th\u00a0 of April, 1906, up to the date when the\u00a0 administrator took charge of the property, amounted to P800, Carloto Jariol having died on\u00a0 June 1, 1908; that the\u00a0 defendants filed a counterclaim, inasmuch as, on the petition of the plaintiff, a receiver was appointed for the land, thereby depriving the defendant M.\u00a0 W. Frield of the possession and use of the same and causing him loss and damage to the amount of P175\u00a0 for each trimester: Wherefore\u00a0 the defendants prayed that judgment\u00a0 be rendered against\u00a0 the plaintiff by absolving the former and sentencing the latter to the payment of loss\u00a0 and damages at the rate of P175\u00a0 for each trimester comprised between the date when the receiver took charge of the land and that\u00a0 when he was dismissed and the property delivered over to M. W. Frield,\u00a0 with\u00a0 the costs\u00a0 against the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>The parties to the suit agreed that Exhibits A and I were authentic; that the house referred to in the testimony of Leandro Jariol was mortgaged by Tomasa Sabilla in\u00a0 the agency of Carlos Martell Ong &amp; Co., on April 27, 1908, for P100; and\u00a0 that, on\u00a0 September 10, 1908, Tomasa Sabilla redeemed the said house, which, after its redemption, was acquired by Silverio Echavez from Tomasa Sabilla and by him mortgaged together with other land belonging to him, for P150.<br\/><br\/>The case came to trial, testimony was adduced by both sides, the documents exhibited were attached to the record, and the court, on\u00a0 September 3, 1909, rendered judgment absolving the defendants from the complaint and dismissing the preliminary injunction issued against them.\u00a0 The plaintiff was\u00a0 absolved from the\u00a0 payment\u00a0 of damages, but the costs were assessed against him.\u00a0 From this judgment the plaintiff excepted and made a written motion for a new trial on the grounds that the evidence did\u00a0 not justify the judgment of the court and that the same was contrary to law.<br\/><br\/>A new trial was held in conformity with the plaintiff's petition,\u00a0 and the\u00a0 judge, after hearing both\u00a0 parties and reconsidering the evidence, sustained his judgment of September 3, 1909,\u00a0 with the sole amendment that the words \"preliminary injunction\" were changed to read\u00a0 \"receivership.\"\u00a0 The plaintiff excepted to this last judgment, and on the same date again moved for a new trial on the same grounds\u00a0 before\u00a0 stated.\u00a0 This motion\u00a0 was overruled and exception waa taken thereto by the plaintiff who filed the required bill of exceptions which was certified to and forwarded to the clerk of this court together with the evidence and documentary exhibits.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 purpose of\u00a0 this suit is to\u00a0 recover a parcel of land transferred by the\u00a0 plaintiff, by unconditional sale,\u00a0 to one of the defendants,\u00a0 Carloto Jariol y Agana, the\u00a0 claim\u00a0 being founded on the allegation that the vendee bound himself to return the property to the vendor whenever the latter should refund to the former\u00a0 the selling price and pay him the amount of the expenses incurred in the improvement of the land.<br\/><br\/>The sale of the land was made in clear and unmistakable terms, without condition or other\u00a0 proviso, on April 6, 1906, as shown by the instrument Exhibit 1, ratified\u00a0 on the same date before\u00a0 a notary, which document\u00a0 was\u00a0 not impugned nor assailed as false; and although at first\u00a0 it was alleged that the contract therein contained was a mortgage, in this second instance, however, it is claimed that the contract was one of sale under <i>pacto de retro<\/i>, a covenant of resale which certainly is not found and does not appear in the said Exhibit 1.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff founds his claim on the contract contained in the instrument Exhibit A,\u00a0 drawn\u00a0 up in the Visayan dialect and translated into Spanish in Exhibit B, by which instrument, executed on the same date as the notarial document Exhibit 1, April 6, 1906,\u00a0 it appears that the vendor of the land, Carloto Jariol y Agana, declared, for himself and his heirs and successors in interest, that the land which he had bought of Carlos Martell Ong, situated in Cababalahan, barrio of Santa Filomena No. 8, Uigan, would be returned by him to the vendor Martell Ong\u00a0 for the sum of P400 on such day and at such time as the latter should pay him that amount,\u00a0 provided that\u00a0 the said Martell Ong should also refund to him\u00a0 the\u00a0 money invested in\u00a0 the improvements on the said land.\u00a0 On the\u00a0 exhibition of this document at the trial of the case, in August, 1909, when it was no longer possible for the party who executed the instrument, Carloto Jariol y\u00a0 Agana, to be present,\u00a0 he\u00a0 having died on June\u00a0 1, 1908, it was not impugned nor rejected by the defendants, one of whom is the son and successor of the deceased, but the defendants\u00a0 in their answer denied each and all the paragraphs of the complaint, except the first.<br\/><br\/>It is alleged that the judge who rendered the judgment appealed from erred\u00a0 in finding\u00a0 that the intention\u00a0 of the contracting parties appears solely from the instrument Exhibit 1, considered separately and independently from that of Exhibit A, which, it is said, is a complement of the former since it is stated therein clearly and categorically, by Carloto\u00a0 Jariol, that the\u00a0 land which he\u00a0 had bought\u00a0 of\u00a0 Carlos Martell for the sum of 3N00 would be returned by him to the latter for the same amount, and it is\u00a0 further alleged that the instrument\u00a0 Exhibit A, as\u00a0 a\u00a0 complement\u00a0 of the said Exhibit 1,\u00a0 may not be considered solely and independently, as was done in the judgment appealed from, both instruments having been drawn up and executed on the same date, April\u00a0 6, 1906.<br\/><br\/>So that the appellant, Carlos\u00a0 Martell Ong, understands that the notarial instrument Exhibit 1 should be considered as amended by the private instrument Exhibit A.\u00a0\u00a0 If such a claim were correct and lawful, the result would be that the widow and heirs of the deceased Carloto Jariol, having acquired the land in question through an unconditional sale, according\u00a0 to\u00a0 Exhibit\u00a0 1, and being therefore the owners, could not dispose of the same nor, consequently, sell it on July 25,\u00a0 1908, to Gregorio Nanaman, according\u00a0 to Exhibit 2, ratified\u00a0 before a notary, and this latter vendee likewise could not legally dispose of the aforesaid property by selling it to M.\u00a0 W. Frield\u00a0 on\u00a0 February 6,\u00a0 1909, as per\u00a0 Exhibit 3, also ratified before a notary.<br\/><br\/>The contents of the instrument Exhibit A, on which the plaintiff\u00a0 bases his right of action,\u00a0 may be true, although, due to the\u00a0 death of the vendee, Carloto Jariol y Agana, the latter's signature, which appears at the foot\u00a0 of the document, is not shown in the record to have been authenticated; nevertheless, whatever the force and effects of the said\u00a0 instrument with respect to the heirs\u00a0 of him who appears as the executor of the document, it is\u00a0 unquestionable\u00a0 that the said instrument can in no manner affect the rights\u00a0 acquired by the defendants\u00a0 Gregorio\u00a0 Nanaman and M. W. Frield, especially those of the latter as\u00a0 the present possessor and owner of the land\u00a0 in\u00a0 dispute, since Nanaman bought the land of the widow and heirs of Carloto Jariol\u00a0 under\u00a0 the instrument Exhibit 1, wherein it appears that\u00a0 Jariol, his predecessor in interest, lawfully acquired the property from the plaintiff through a contract of absolute and unconditional purchase and sale, and as Gregorio Nanaman also acquired the realty from its true owners in a lawful\u00a0 manner, it can not be denied that M.\u00a0 W.\u00a0 Frield, the last\u00a0 vendee, is now the absolute owner of the said land, for both Nanaman and the\u00a0 widow\u00a0 and heirs of Carloto\u00a0 Jariol\u00a0 could freely dispose of\u00a0 the property without any restriction\u00a0 whatever.<br\/><br\/>Assuming the truth of the statements contained in the instrument Exhibit A, as they appear\u00a0 in the translation Exhibit B, it\u00a0 may be concluded\u00a0 that the said instrument, although\u00a0 it was drawn up on the same date as the\u00a0 notarial instrument Exhibit 1, was undoubtedly written and drawn up after the execution of the notarial document Exhibit 1, and under this hypothesis, if it be true that the instrument Exhibit A was executed by Carloto Jariol to alter the stipulations of the notarial instrument\u00a0 Exhibit 1, the\u00a0 existence of\u00a0 the said document Exhibit A produces no\u00a0 legal effect against the third parties, Gregorio Nanaman and M. W. Frield, who are the successive vendees of the said property.<br\/><br\/>Article 1230 of the Civil Code provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"Private instruments executed for the purpose of changing the agreements made in a public\u00a0 instrument shall produce no effect against a third person.\"<\/blockquote>The probatory effect\u00a0 of an\u00a0 authenticated or\u00a0 legalized private document\u00a0 is\u00a0 generally\u00a0 limited\u00a0 to the interested parties and to their heirs, or successors in\u00a0 interest, and does not extend to third persons, especially when the latter were not\u00a0 aware of the alteration of the stipulations of the public document\u00a0 made in the private\u00a0 document drawn up subsequently.<br\/><br\/>The complaint also prays that should the land in litigation have been transferred, the deeds\u00a0 of conveyance be declared null and void.\u00a0 In deciding whether this petition may properly be granted or not, article 1302 of the Civil Code must be taken into account, which is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"The action for nullity of contracts may be brought by those who are principally or subsidiarily obligated by virtue thereof.\u00a0\u00a0 Persons with capacity can not, however, allege the incapacity of those with whom they contracted; neither those who caused the intimidation or violence, or employed deceit, or caused the error, can base their action\u00a0 on these defects of the contract.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The plaintiff is not the party obligated principally nor subsidiarily in the deeds, of sale, whose nullification he asks for, and even though the Exhibit A\u00a0 were recognized as authentic\u00a0 and efficacious, it would be improper to admit that the said plaintiff\u00a0 was injured in his rights by reason of the successive transfers of the said\u00a0 property and is\u00a0 on such account entitled to exercise an action for nullification, inasmuch as the widow and heirs of the supposed executor of the said instrument acted in good faith in selling the land, since they were not aware of the existence of the document. With still more reason must this circumstance be recognized in favor of the other purchasers, Nanaman and Frield, for it can be asserted that the said transfers were not effected fraudulently and to the detriment of the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>Moreover, if, in accordance with the preinserted article 1230\u00a0 of the code, the said private document produces no legal\u00a0 effect whatever against. third\u00a0 persons, such\u00a0 as\u00a0 the successive vendees of the property, with much less reason can it give\u00a0 rise to an action for rescission seeking the annulment of\u00a0 the said\u00a0 contracts of sale in which the plaintiff had no\u00a0 right whatever to\u00a0 intervene.<br\/><br\/>It is\u00a0 to be noted\u00a0 that when the widow of the deceased Carloto Jariol, Tomasa Sabilla,\u00a0 and\u00a0 her son, Leandro\u00a0 Jariol, unconditionally sold the\u00a0 said\u00a0 land to Gregorio Nanaman,\u00a0 on July\u00a0 25, 1908, already\u00a0 more than a\u00a0 month and a half had\u00a0 elapsed since the death of their predecessor in interest, and they had no knowledge of the existence of the instrument\u00a0 Exhibit\u00a0 A.\u00a0 Leandro Jariol\u00a0 only learned\u00a0 that there was such a document on being sued in the justice of the peace court\u00a0 by\u00a0 the plaintiff\u00a0 Carlos\u00a0 Martell for loss and damage on account of the sale\u00a0 of the land in litigation by Jariol, and\u00a0 because of which claim Leandro\u00a0 Jariol was sentenced to pay\u00a0 to the plaintiff P200 for loss and damage, and the costs, a judgment which had to be executed for the reason that\u00a0 it was not appealed.\u00a0 Likewise it must be borne in mind that it was proved that the said widow and\u00a0 the heir of\u00a0 the\u00a0 deceased owner of the\u00a0 land, being in need of money,\u00a0 before they sold the property to Nanaman, offered to sell it to\u00a0 the plaintiff who then only offered for the land the sum of\u00a0 P300, an offer\u00a0 which does not harmonize with Carlos Martell's allegation\u00a0 that he\u00a0 was entitled\u00a0 to recover the property by the payment of the same sum for which he had sold it,\u00a0 to wit, P400, because, were it true that he did not unconditionally sell it,\u00a0 in\u00a0 spite of the proof\u00a0 to the contrary, according to the notarial instrument Exhibit\u00a0 1, on the offer being made to him to sell him the\u00a0 same parcel of land, he would naturally have alleged\u00a0 his right to repurchase it, in accordance with the contents of the private document Exhibit A.<br\/><br\/>Besides, even though the petition were\u00a0 proper, that the defendant Leandro Jariol be sentenced to\u00a0 pay\u00a0 P200 as an indemnity for loss and damage, yet, since he was so sentenced in a judgment rendered by the justice of the peace, by virtue of an express petition made by the\u00a0 plaintiff,\u00a0 it would neither be just nor reasonable that he be sentenced\u00a0 to pay sueh indemnity again in this instance.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, and finding the judgment appealed from to be in\u00a0 accordance with law, it is proper,\u00a0 in our opinion, to affirm the same, which we\u00a0 hereby do, with the costs against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiffs for this amount.<br\/><br\/>The defendant appealed and now insists:<br\/><ol><li>\u00a0That this action was prematurely brought; and,<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>That Exhibit A, the document which forms the basis of this action, is null and void for the reason that the internal-revenue stamps are not affixed thereto, as required by section 58 of Act No. 1189.<\/li><\/ol>From the record it appears that for some time prior to the 11th of February, 1908, there had been various transactions carried on between the plaintiffs and the defendant whereby the defendant was indebted to the plaintiffs in various sums for the rent and use of a certain hacienda, the property of the plaintiffs. A settlement was made on the 11th of February, 1908; subsequently, on March 5 of the samear, and growing out of said settlement, the defendant signed an obligation, acknowledging an indebtedness in favor of the plaintiffs in the sum of P2,261. This obligation is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"I acknowledge to be indebted to Enrique Jesus Delgado and his wife, Concepcion Figueroa, in the sum of P2,261, as the result of the liquidation of accounts had between the undersigned and the said parties, in accordance with paragraph (6), clause 3, of our agreement of compromise executed February eleventh, last, the amount mentioned in the said clause being changed to that which is stated herein.<br\/><br\/>\"Bacolod, March 5, 1908.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: right;\">(Signed)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"AGUSTIN AMENABAR.\"<br\/><\/div><\/blockquote>The settlement referred to in the foregoing obligation is fully set forth in plaintiffs' Exhibit B, which is a public notarial instrument. In this Exhibit B the defendant expressly agreed to cede to the plaintiffs, in payment of his debt of P12,791.24, all the property, real and personal, described therein. He acknowledged, as appears in this Exhibit B, that he owed the plaintiffs the sum of P2,336.74, being the balance due the said plaintiffs, according to the said settlement, and agreed to execute his note for this amount. Before executing the note, Exhibit A, by agreement of the parties, a certain amount, being the debt of one of the laborers, was deducted from the sum of P2,336.74, leaving a net balance of P2,261.<br\/><br\/>This obligation, dated March 5, 1908, above set forth, is pure, simple, and unconditional. No date was fixed for its fulfillment. The defendant has failed to show that it was the intention of the plaintiffs to grant him any extension of time within which to pay this debt. From the language of these two documents, Exhibits A and B, it can not be inferred that such was the intention of the plaintiffs.<br\/><br\/>The defendant does not deny the execution of this obligation of indebtedness, Exhibit A, neither does he deny the correctness of the amount claimed, nor that he justly owes the plaintiffs the said amount. This obligation was signed on March 5, 1908. Demand having been made after this date upon the defendant for the payment of same, and he having failed to make such payment, the plaintiffs commenced this action on the 23d of November, 1908.<br\/><br\/>In accordance with the old laws in force in this country prior to the enactment of the present Civil Code, the payment of obligations of this character could have been demanded ten days after they were contracted. Under the provisions of the Civil Code now in force the plaintiffs could have demanded the payment of this obligation at once, inasmuch as it has not been shown, neither can it be inferred from the nature and circumstances of the obligation, that it was the intention of the plaintiffs to grant the defendant an extension of time. (Floriano <i>vs.<\/i> Delgado, 11 Phil. Rep., 154; art. 1128, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>Section 58 of Act No. 1189 is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Any person who willfully fails to affix a stamp or stamps to any document at the time and in the manner required by Article XI of this Act shall be punished by a fine in the sum of two hundred pesos, and the document to which the stamp or stamps should have been affixed shall be void until rendered valid by the affixture of the proper stamp or stamps thereto.\"<\/blockquote>According to paragraphs 1, 2, and 11 of section 116 of said Act No. 1189, it was the duty of the defendant, as maker of this promissory note, Exhibit A, to pay for the stamps and affix the same thereto at the time of the making and signing of the said note. The defendant failed to comply with these provisions of law and he now seeks to take advantage of his own wrong by insisting that this promissory note has no legal value.<br\/><br\/>It is true that section 58, supra, specifically states that when any person willfully fails to affix the stamps to a document of this character, the same shall be void until rendered valid by the affixture of the proper stamps. The stamps never had been affixed to the note sued upon in this case.<br\/><br\/>If the note be discarded there is an abundance of testimony in the record to support the judgment. The plaintiff, Enrique Delgado, testified positively.during the trial of this cause in the court below, that the defendant is justly indebted to him and his wife in the sum of P2,261. The defendant, as appears from his testimony, admitted having signed both Exhibits A and B, and that the plaintiff, Delgado, never demanded of him the payment of the amount expressed in Exhibit A since the date of the same. By this testimony the defendant himself, in effect, admits that he had not paid this debt.<br\/><br\/>The judgment is, therefore, affirmed with costs against the appellant.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

J. Carroll, Bishop of the Apostolic Roman Catholic Church,\u00a0 a\u00a0 unipersonal\u00a0 corporation, and\u00a0 the said Juan Ballesteros, as plaintiffs,\u00a0 instituted this action in this Supreme Court against the Honorable Isidro Paredes, judge of the Court of First Instance of the Province of Pangasinan, by filing a complaint in which they set up the said trials in the justice of the peace court and the\u00a0 Court of First Instance,\u00a0 and alleged that the defendant\u00a0 judge exceeded his jurisdiction in\u00a0 directing in his\u00a0 sentence that the said Juan Ballesteros remove the gates\u00a0 heretofore\u00a0 mentioned, for the reason that the said gates were placed on the property of the Roman\u00a0 Catholic Church\u00a0 and not upon a public highway, and that under the law the said Ballesteros could not appeal to this court; and there existing ho other speedy and adequate remedy they therefore prayed that\u00a0 a preliminary injunction be issued out of this court,\u00a0 directed to the defendant judge, restraining him from carrying into effect that part of the said sentence\u00a0 which refers to the removal of the said gates; that upon hearing a writ of certiorari be issued, directing the record to be forwarded to this court for\u00a0 review, and after review of the same that judgment be rendered declaring that that part of the said sentence is null and\u00a0 void.\u00a0 The proper bond having been filed and approved,\u00a0 the\u00a0 vacation\u00a0 justice\u00a0 issued, on\u00a0 the same day, March\u00a0 29,\u00a0 1910, the preliminary\u00a0 injunction prayed\u00a0 for.<br\/><br\/>The record having been forwarded\u00a0 to this court in accordance with\u00a0 the\u00a0 law and\u00a0 the\u00a0 procedure in\u00a0 such cases, and\u00a0 the parties having been\u00a0 heard\u00a0 through their respective counsel, the case was submitted for final determination.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiffs insist: First,\u00a0 that inasmuch as the question of\u00a0 title to real property was\u00a0 involved in the trial of this case before the justice of the peace,\u00a0 the said justice\u00a0 of\u00a0 the peace exceeded his jurisdiction proceeding with said trial and pronouncing judgment in the same;\u00a0 second,\u00a0 that\u00a0 as the justice\u00a0 of the peace had no jurisdiction to convict the defendant, Ballesteros, the Court of First Instance, on appeal, was without\u00a0 jurisdiction to try the\u00a0 case upon its merits; and, third, that if the Court of First Instance did acquire jurisdiction to try the case upon its merits, it exceeded its jurisdiction in condemning the said Ballesteros. to remove the gates in\u00a0 question.<br\/><br\/>The Attorney-General, representing the defendant judge, is of the opinion that both the justice of the peace and the Court of First\u00a0 Instance\u00a0 had jurisdiction to determine the guilt of the accused and to impose the penalties complained of, including an order to remove the gates, inasmuch as the said Ballesteros closed or obstructed a public highway, it having been established that the said gates were\u00a0 placed across a street\u00a0 or\u00a0 highway\u00a0 in violation of law.<br\/><br\/>The validity of that part of the penalty of the defendant judge which refers to the fine imposed is not before us.<br\/><br\/>The ownership of the\u00a0 land where the said Juan\u00a0 Ballesteros placed the gates can not be determined at this time, but it is necessary to inquire whether\u00a0 or not the title to real property was involved in order to determine the jurisdiction, of\u00a0 the justice\u00a0 of the peace to convict the accused, Ballesteros.<br\/><br\/>The accused, Juan\u00a0 Ballesteros,\u00a0 testified in the\u00a0 justice of the peace court that before the 29th of September, 1909, the date on which the gates were erected, no\u00a0 one interfered with the free passage of vehicles, carts, and the public generally;\u00a0 but on\u00a0 being\u00a0 asked to whom that\u00a0 real\u00a0 property belonged he .replied that it was the property of the Church; that he knew that the same was the property of the Church for the reason\u00a0 that the\u00a0 same was\u00a0 surrounded by\u00a0 a wall about one meter high, which wall inclosed the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">atrio<\/span> of the church, and that this Supreme Court having finally\u00a0 determined that\u00a0 the church building, convent, and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">atrio<\/span> are the property of the\u00a0 Roman Catholic Church, and he, Juan Ballesteros, having received instructions\u00a0 from the Bishop, erected\u00a0 the gates at those\u00a0 places, believing that he had authority\u00a0 to do\u00a0 so.\u00a0 This witness\u00a0 explained that at the places where the said\u00a0 gates were erected the walls had been torn\u00a0 down by usage almost\u00a0 level with the ground, and that it was at these two\u00a0 low places that the gates were erected.\u00a0 While\u00a0 this witness,\u00a0 Juan\u00a0 Ballesteros, admitted that the public passed freely to and fro through this passageway before the gates were erected,\u00a0 he did not concede or admit that the said\u00a0 land was public property, but strongly insisted that the same was the private property of the Church, basing this contention on the decision of this court and on the fact that the said property was inclosed by walls placed there by the Church.<br\/><br\/>According to a\u00a0 plan or rough\u00a0 draft\u00a0 of the premises, which is admitted by both the plaintiffs and the defendant to be substantially correct, it appears that the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">atrio<\/span> which, according to Juan Ballesteros, is inclosed by a wall, is just in front of\u00a0 the main entrance to\u00a0 the church on the south and joins the Church property.\u00a0 The\u00a0 road claimed to be a public highway by the defendant judge, and across which the gates were placed,\u00a0 passes entirely\u00a0 across the southern end of the said church, just\u00a0 in front of the main entrance, and according to this plan the said alleged public highway is about the same distance from the main\u00a0 entrance to the church as the said highway is wide.<br\/><br\/>The justice of the peace in his\u00a0 decision stated that the defense of the accused, Ballesteros, was that he was directed to place the gates there by his superior, the Bishop of Vigan. The justice of the peace in the same sentence found that the said real property\u00a0 belonged\u00a0 to\u00a0 the public and was under the\u00a0 exclusive control\u00a0 of the municipality,\u00a0 and\u00a0 further found that the public had acquired the same by prescription.<br\/><br\/>So it is clear from this record that a real question was raised in the justice of the\u00a0 peace court as to the ownerhip of this land.\u00a0 This\u00a0 was the\u00a0 real defense of the defendant.\u00a0 He did not deny having placed\u00a0 the gates there, but stated\u00a0 that\u00a0 he did so, believing that he was placing them\u00a0 upon\u00a0 the\u00a0 Church property.\u00a0\u00a0 A\u00a0 mere allegation\u00a0 of ownership is not sufficient to oust a justice of the\u00a0 peace of jurisdiction, but when\u00a0 it develops during the trial from the proofs that the title to real property is necessarily involved as in this case,\u00a0 then\u00a0 the justice of the\u00a0 peace loses jurisdiction\u00a0 to try and determine the action.<br\/><blockquote>\"A\u00a0 justice of the\u00a0 peace shall\u00a0 have no\u00a0 jurisdiction\u00a0 to adjudicate questions of title to real estate or any interest therein, and whenever a case requiring such adjudication is brought before him it shall be his duty, upon discovering the same, to suspend further proceedings therein and certify the cause forthwith to the Court of First Instance\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.\" (Sec. 3, Act No. 1627.)<br\/><\/blockquote>A justice\u00a0 of the peace has\u00a0 no jurisdiction to deprive a ma of his real property by\u00a0 determining the title\u00a0 to the same.\u00a0\u00a0 For better reasons\u00a0 he\u00a0 should not\u00a0 have jurisdiction to deprive a man of his liberty when, in order to\u00a0 do so, it is necessary for him to\u00a0 first determine the title to real property.<br\/><br\/>In the case at bar the justice of the peace had jurisdiction when the proceedings started\u00a0 in his court, but during the trial of the\u00a0 same\u00a0 he lost jurisdiction when\u00a0 the\u00a0 question of title to real property arose.\u00a0\u00a0 He was then as completely without jurisdiction to proceed as if he had never acquired same.\u00a0\u00a0 So the judgment rendered by the\u00a0 justice of the peace in this case was null and\u00a0 void for want of jurisdiction of the\u00a0 subject matter.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 defendant, Ballesteros, appealed to the Court of First Instance.\u00a0 The law governing\u00a0 appeals\u00a0 in\u00a0 criminal cases\u00a0 is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"*\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 The convicted party\u00a0 may appeal\u00a0 from any final judgment of a justice of the peace in a criminal cause to the\u00a0 Court\u00a0 of First Instance by filing a notice of appeal with such justice within fifteen\u00a0 days after the entry of judgment. *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.\"\u00a0 (Sec. 34, Act No.\u00a0 1627.)<br\/><br\/>\"All cases\u00a0 appealed from a justice's\u00a0 court shall\u00a0 be tried in all respects anew in the court to which the same are appealed; but on the hearing\u00a0 of such appeals it shall not be necessary,\u00a0 unless the appeal shall involve the constitutionality or legality of a statute, that a written record of the proceedings be kept; but\u00a0 shall\u00a0 be sufficient if the appellate court keeps a docket of\u00a0 the proceedings in the form prescribed in the next preceding section.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Sec. 54, General Orders, No. 58.)<\/blockquote>An\u00a0 appeal will not lie to the Supreme\u00a0 Court from a judgment of the Court of First Instance, tried\u00a0 on\u00a0 appeal, when the justice of the peace\u00a0 had\u00a0 jurisdiction, except in cases involving the validity or constitutionality of a statute or municipal ordinance.\u00a0\u00a0 (Sec. 16 of Act No. 1627.)<br\/><br\/>Courts of First Instance have both original and appellate jurisdiction.\u00a0\u00a0 They have\u00a0 jurisdiction of the person and of the subject matter in all cases on appeal from justices of the peace when properly brought before\u00a0 them.\u00a0\u00a0 Appealed criminal cases \"shall be tried in all respects anew.\"\u00a0\u00a0 De novo, over again.\u00a0 The nature\u00a0 of the action\u00a0 can not be changed in the Court of First\u00a0 Instance,\u00a0 but\u00a0 must be tried de novo upon its merits on the same process\u00a0 and pleadings; that is, the process and pleadings must be\u00a0 of\u00a0 the same nature as those in the justice of the peace court. The prosecuting officer, however, can substitute his own complaint for that filed in the justice of the peace court, provided the nature of the action is not changed.\u00a0 In this jurisdiction no\u00a0 provision is made for an appeal from justice of the peace courts upon the law only, but all appeals are taken for a new trial, and the defendant is entitled to interpose the same\u00a0 objections as he could have\u00a0 interposed in the justice of the peace courts.<br\/><br\/>If the sentence imposed upon him by the justice of the peace is void for want\u00a0 of jurisdiction of the subject matter, the defendant, on appeal, has a\u00a0 right to have the appellate court so determine, or he may\u00a0 elect to have the Court of First Instance try the\u00a0 case upon its merits, without raising the question of the jurisdiction\u00a0 of the justice of\u00a0 the\u00a0 peace. If he raises no objection with reference to the jurisdiction of the justice of the peace and submits himself to\u00a0 be retried for the crime for which he\u00a0 was charged,\u00a0 then he will\u00a0 be presumed to have waived all questions\u00a0 as to jurisdiction, and he can not thereafter raise this question of jurisdiction, provided the appellate court had jurisdiction of his person and the subject matter.\u00a0\u00a0 But\u00a0 should\u00a0 he\u00a0 make\u00a0 a\u00a0 timely objection in the appellate court as to the want or excess of jurisdiction of the justice of the peace, and should the court find such objection well founded, then it acquires jurisdiction only for the purpose of dismissing the same, without prejudice, however, to the institution of a new proceeding for the same criminal acts in the proper tribunal.\u00a0 But in order to take advantage of these rights\u00a0 the appellant must by proper objection call the attention of the court to these facts and give the court an opportunity to\u00a0 pass upon the validity of such sentence; otherwise he will be, as we have said, presumed to have waived the question of jurisdiction. No agreement of the parties,\u00a0 or waiver of objection,\u00a0 can confer jurisdiction\u00a0 on an appellate court\u00a0 which has\u00a0 no jurisdiction of the subject matter.\u00a0\u00a0 But in the case at bar the\u00a0 Court of First Instance had jurisdiction, both of the person and of the subject matter.<br\/><br\/>In 24 Cyc, 641, it is said:<br\/><blockquote>\"On appeal from a justice of the peace, the appellate court has\u00a0 only such jurisdiction as the justice\u00a0 had, and if he had no jurisdiction, the appellate court\u00a0 acquires none; and it is immaterial that such court has original\u00a0 jurisdiction\u00a0 of the subject matter of the action.\"<\/blockquote>A number of\u00a0 cases from various States in the American Union are cited\u00a0 in support of this proposition.\u00a0 It must be noted that this rule is based upon the theory that the appellate\u00a0 court\u00a0 had\u00a0 jurisdiction of\u00a0 the\u00a0 subject matter\u00a0 of\u00a0 the action.<br\/><br\/>On page 643 of the same volume (24 Cyc.)\u00a0 it is said:<br\/><blockquote>\"While it\u00a0 has been held that, where\u00a0 the justice of the peace had no jurisdiction of the subject matter of an action, the\u00a0 parties\u00a0 can not\u00a0 confer jurisdiction on the\u00a0 appellate court by consent, the better view seems to be that where the appellate court has original as well\u00a0 as appellate jurisdiction of the cause, jurisdiction of both\u00a0 the subject matter and\u00a0 the\u00a0 person may be\u00a0 conferred\u00a0 upon it\u00a0 by waiver\u00a0 or consent.\u00a0\u00a0 (Citing cases from Alabama,\u00a0 Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, and Ohio.)<br\/><br\/>\"The question of want of jurisdiction may be raised\u00a0 by motion to dismiss the proceedings, or by objecting at the trial to the introduction of any evidence on\u00a0 behalf\u00a0 of plaintiff.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Id.)<\/blockquote>These propositions are applicable alike to both criminal and civil cases.<br\/><br\/>In the case at bar the accused, Ballesteros, made no objection whatever\u00a0 in the Court\u00a0 of\u00a0 First Instance to the\u00a0 trial being had upon its merits.\u00a0 He\u00a0 did not in any way call the attention of the Court of First Instance to the fact that the sentence imposed upon him by the justice of the peace was void for want of jurisdiction.\u00a0 We, therefore, conclude that he waived these questions and submitted\u00a0 himself to be retried for the crime charged upon the merits of the case.<br\/><br\/>That part of the sentence imposing a fine\u00a0 and costs upon Ballesteros is not questioned, but the validity of that\u00a0 part of the said sentence wherein Ballesteros was sentenced to remove the gates is before us for determination.<br\/><br\/>The law which gave the Court of First Instance jurisdiction of the subject matter is found in section 16 of Act No. 1511, which provides as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"It shall be unlawful\u00a0 for any\u00a0 person to convert any\u00a0 part of any public highway, bridge,\u00a0 wharf, or trail to his\u00a0 own private use,\u00a0 or to\u00a0 obstruct\u00a0 or\u00a0 damage\u00a0 the same\u00a0 in\u00a0 any manner, or to remove any\u00a0 tool or road making material therefrom, or to mutilate, damage, destroy, or in any manner interfere with any\u00a0 public bridge, culvert, or drainage canal,\u00a0 or to use any public\u00a0 ditch for irrigation or other private purposes, and any person so offending shall be punished by a line\u00a0 of not more than one hundred pesos, or by imprisonment at hard labor not exceeding\u00a0 three months, or by\u00a0 both such fine\u00a0 and imprisonment, in the discretion of the court.\u00a0 The provisions of this section shall likewise be applicable to highways, bridges, wharves, and trails in provinces organized under Act Numbered Thirteen hundred and\u00a0 ninety-six, notwithstanding the limitations contained in sections one to six of this Act.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Nothing is said in this section, nor anywhere else in the Act, about the removal of the obstructions.\u00a0 Our attention has not been called to any\u00a0 other provision of law on this subject, except paragraph 6\u00a0 of article 584 of the Penal Code, which provides that -<br\/><blockquote>\"Those who shall\u00a0 obstruct the\u00a0 sidewalks, streets, and public places by their acts or with wares of any kind shall be punished with\u00a0 the penalty of a fine of from fifteen to one hundred and twenty-five pesetas or censure.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The above article of the Penal Code makes no provision for the removal of the obstruction.<br\/><br\/>The crimes defined and punished by section 16 of Act No, 1511,\u00a0 <i>supra,<\/i>\u00a0 are known in\u00a0 American jurisprudence as \"public nuisances.\"\u00a0 A public nuisance is a common law offense, and its creation or maintenance\u00a0 is, in the United States, an indictable offense, both at common law and under the statutes of the various States (29\u00a0 Cyc, 1278).\u00a0\u00a0 In\u00a0 the various States there are found numerous statutes providing for the punishment or the imposition of penalties oh persons creating or maintaining: nuisances,\u00a0 which do not, however, supersede the common law,\u00a0 where\u00a0 they do not attempt to cover all cases\u00a0 of public nuisances.\u00a0 Such statutes are construed according to the general rules for the construction of. penal statutes,\u00a0 (29 Cyc, 1279, and cases cited.)<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding the fact that section 16 of Act No. 1511, supra, makes no provision for the removal of obstructions, the Attorney-General insists that the\u00a0 Court\u00a0 of First\u00a0 Instance had jurisdiction to condemn the defendant, Ballesteros,\u00a0 to remove the gates\u00a0 in question in this\u00a0 case.\u00a0 In support of this proposition he calls the\u00a0 court's attention to the cases of Barclay <i>vs.<\/i> Commonwealth\u00a0 (25 Pa. St., 503)., Wetmore <i>vs<\/i>. Tracy (14\u00a0 Wend., 250),\u00a0 Lancaster Turnpike Co.,<i> vs<\/i>. Rogers (2 Pa. St., 114), and sections 828 and 829 of Bishop's Work on Criminal Law, eighth edition.<br\/><br\/>The case of Barclay <i>vs.<\/i> Commonwealth,<i> supra,<\/i>\u00a0 is based on Taggart's case (21 Pa. St., 527).\u00a0 In this latter case the charge on which the defendant was convicted was based on the common-law offense, \"a nuisance in the King's highway,\" The defendant was sentenced to abate the nuisance at his own costs.\u00a0 The court said, among other things, that -<br\/><blockquote>\"Where the indictment is at common law, as this was, we know of no decision that such a sentence\u00a0 is illegal.\"<\/blockquote>That part of section 828 of Bishop's New Criminal Law, <i>supra<\/i>, which refers to the abatement of\u00a0 nuisances, says:<br\/><blockquote>\"Whenever a subject\u00a0 of property,\u00a0 whether through its owner's fault or not, is in a situation to be a nuisance, it is not strictly forfeited,\u00a0 but\u00a0 the nuisance may\u00a0 be abated,\u00a0 to the destruction, if necessary, of the property.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Under No. 2 of section 821\u00a0 of this same work on criminal law several cases are cited in support of this doctrine, one of which is the case\u00a0 of\u00a0 Lancaster <i>vs.<\/i> Rogers,<i> supra.<\/i>\u00a0\u00a0 On examination of\u00a0 these cases, as well as those\u00a0 cited by the Attorney-General, <i>supra, <\/i>it will be seen that they were either based on the\u00a0 common law, or on\u00a0 statutes which did not exclude the common-law\u00a0 remedies.<br\/><br\/>Some of the courts in the United States\u00a0 hold that the right to abate a public nuisance is not affected by statutes imposing a penalty for the offense,\u00a0 unless the negative words are used, evincing an intent to exclude the common-law remedies (29 Cyc., 1279).\u00a0 That is, where the statute makes a.public nuisance a crime or misdemeanor, providing a penalty for the violation of\u00a0 the same,\u00a0 but makes no provision for the abatement or\u00a0 removal of the obstruction, and\u00a0 where the wording of\u00a0 the\u00a0 statute does\u00a0 not clearly\u00a0 show that it was the intention to\u00a0 exclude\u00a0 the common-law remedies, one of which is the removal of the obstruction, then such common law remedies can be applied, upon the theory that the common law is in force in the United States.<br\/><blockquote>\"But\u00a0 neither English\u00a0 nor\u00a0 American common law is in force in these\u00a0 Islands,\u00a0 nor\u00a0 are the doctrines derived therefrom binding upon our courts, save only in so far as they are founded on sound principles, applicable to local conditions, and are not in conflict with existing law;\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\" (U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Cuna, 12 Phil. Rep., 241.)<br\/><\/blockquote>Articles 1 and 21 of the Penal Code are as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Art. 1.\u00a0 Crimes or misdemeanors are\u00a0 voluntary acts or omissions punished by law.<br\/><br\/>\"Art. 21. No crime\u00a0 or misdemeanor shall be punished by a penalty which was not established by law prior to its commission.\"<\/blockquote>So\u00a0 to hold\u00a0 that the\u00a0 common-law\u00a0 remedies\u00a0 in\u00a0 cases of public nuisances apply in this country would be contrary to these express\u00a0 provisions.\u00a0\u00a0 The civil\u00a0 law is in force in this jurisdiction\u00a0 and all penalties imposed for crimes or misdemeanors must be\u00a0 provided for by statute, and a penalty which is not so provided is without\u00a0 the jurisdiction\u00a0 of the courts and null and void.<br\/><br\/>In the case\u00a0 at bar the Court of First Instance sentenced the defendant, Ballesteros, to remove the gates\u00a0 in question, thereby\u00a0 imposing\u00a0 a penalty which\u00a0 was unauthorized by statute.\u00a0 Should an attempt have been made to\u00a0 execute this part of the sentence and should Ballesteros have refused to remove\u00a0 the gates, and should the court have imprisoned him until\u00a0\u00a0 he complied\u00a0 with\u00a0 that part of\u00a0 the sentence, such imprisonment would\u00a0 have been\u00a0 illegal. The said defendant. was without jurisdiction to condemn the\u00a0 said Ballesteros to remove the gates in question, and that part\u00a0 of the is null and void.<br\/><br\/>A\u00a0 party\u00a0 entitled to\u00a0 appeal,\u00a0 or to pursue\u00a0 some other remedy, who has lost the right, through inadvertence, accident or mistake,\u00a0 may have a\u00a0 remedy by certiorari, on a showing of probable merits and freedom from fault.\u00a0 (6 Cyc, 763, and cases from Alabama, Arkansas, District of Columbia, Mississippi, North\u00a0 Carolina, Oregon, and Tennessee.)<br\/><br\/>In the case at bar Ballesteros could have appealed to this court from the decision of the Court of First Instance, as the justice of\u00a0 the peace had no jurisdiction to try the\u00a0 case and impose the penalties,\u00a0 but his failure to appeal was not through any neglect or fault of his, as he honestly believed that in view of the provisions of section 16 of Act No. 1627, supra, he could not appeal.\u00a0 Under these circumstances he is clearly entitled to the remedy of certiorari.<br\/><br\/>So we conclude:<br\/><ol><li>That a justice of the peace has no jurisdiction\u00a0 to try and determine any case, either\u00a0 criminal or civil, where the title to real property is necessarily involved, and when such a case comes before him he should immediately certify it to the Court of First Instance;<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>That in a\u00a0 criminal case where a justice of the peace renders a judgment wherein he does not have jurisdiction of the person of the defendant and the subject matter of the action, and an appeal is taken to the Court of First Instance, and no objection is interposed\u00a0 in the said Court of First Instance as to the\u00a0 jurisdiction of the justice of the\u00a0 peace, then the\u00a0 defendant will be presumed to\u00a0 have waived all objections to such\u00a0 jurisdiction\u00a0 and the case can be tried upon its merits; provided, however, that the\u00a0 nature of the action is\u00a0 not changed\u00a0 and that\u00a0 the said\u00a0 Court\u00a0 of First Instance had jurisdiction of the subject matter of the action; but when a timely\u00a0 objection is made to\u00a0 the jurisdiction of the appellate court\u00a0 (Court of First Instance) to try such case on its merits, the said court only acquires jurisdiction to dismiss the case; and,<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>That under existing law the courts have no jurisdiction to impose, as a\u00a0 part of the penalty in a criminal action,\u00a0 a sentence condemning the defendant to abate the nuisance when convicted for having violated the provisions of Act No. 1511.<\/li><\/ol>Let judgment be entered declaring that part of the sentence imposed upon the said Ballesteros, condemning him to remove the gates in question, null and void, and that the preliminary injunction heretofore issued be made perpetual, without any\u00a0 special ruling\u00a0 as to costs.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano,\u00a0 C.\u00a0 J.,\u00a0 Torres, Johnson<\/i>, and\u00a0 <i>Moreland, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><\/div>",

Neither of the defendants placed a\u00a0 date upon the indorsement made by him.\u00a0 Thereupon payment was made in one form or another by the bank to Peters of the sum named in the instrument.\u00a0 On presentation by the bank, payment of the instrument was refused by the drawee, the Assistant Treasurer of the United\u00a0 States at New\u00a0 York,\u00a0 upon the ground that the name of the paymaster of the United States Navy upon said instrument had been forged.\u00a0\u00a0 The instrument was duly protested as a check and the notice required by law given to both of the defendants.\u00a0\u00a0 This action was brought by the plaintiff against both Peters\u00a0 and Hawkes to recover the $3,000\u00a0 paid by\u00a0 the plaintiff\u00a0 upon\u00a0 said instrument.\u00a0\u00a0 The following is a copy of the instrument in question :<br\/><blockquote><div style=\"text-align: center;\">\"No. 312342.<br\/><\/div><br\/><div style=\"text-align: right;\">\"CAVITE, P.

Did\u00a0 you say anything to him at\u00a0 that time? - A.\u00a0 I told him to sign under Mr. Peters's signature.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Is that all the conversation that\u00a0 occurred between Mr. Hawkes and yourself? - A. That is all I can remember.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Then it is a fact, is it not, that at that time all that was done,\u00a0 so far as you can say\u00a0 of your own knowledge, was that Mr. Hawkes placed his signature on the back of the check and said nothing to you at all? - A. I can not say for sure whether he said anything or whether he did\u00a0 not say anything.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. But\u00a0 to the\u00a0 best of\u00a0 your memory he did not? - A. Yes, sir.<br\/><br\/>\"Court\u00a0 (asking question).\u00a0 Do\u00a0 you mean to say that he did not say anything? - A.\u00a0 Yes, sir.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. But\u00a0 your impression\u00a0 is that he did not say anything? - A. Yes, sir.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. What do you mean by your answer 'yes, sir'?\u00a0 What do you mean by that ? - A. I mean\u00a0 that he signed the check as he was told to sign\u00a0 it without saying anything.\"<\/blockquote>On cross-examination the following questions and answers appear:<br\/><blockquote>\"Q. Is it not a fact that at the time that Mr.\u00a0 Peters and Mr. Hawkes came to the bank together Mr. Peters said to you that he brought Mr. Hawkes, and that you\u00a0 then asked Mr.\u00a0 Hawkes\u00a0 if\u00a0 he knew Mr.\u00a0 Peters and\u00a0 could identify him ? - A. I perhaps did say that in the ordinary way.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. And\u00a0 that\u00a0 he could identify him? - A. That\u00a0 is the ordinary question which we ask in cases of that kind.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. But are you sure that you did not say words to that effect ? - A.\u00a0 I should not like to say at all.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. But the probability is that you did say that to him? -\u00a0\u00a0 A. Yes, sir.\"<\/blockquote>It is thus evident from the uncontradicted proof that Mr. Hawkes came to\u00a0 the bank and indorsed the check<i> without saying anything\u00a0 whatever.<\/i>\u00a0 It is also apparent\u00a0 that the evidence shows that the clerk of the bank <i>said nothing to Hawkes, at\u00a0 least nothing\u00a0 about identifying Peters.<\/i>\u00a0 All that the witness said in his testimony on that subject, upon which alone\u00a0 is based the contention\u00a0 that Hawkes\u00a0 indorsed simply to identify Peters,\u00a0 is that it was probable that he asked Mr. Hawkes if he could identify Peters, basing, as he says, that statement not upon his recollection or memory as to <i>what actually occurred <\/i>but upon a probability arising out of a custom which according to his own\u00a0 best recollection and memory was\u00a0 not followed on that occasion.\u00a0\u00a0 This is not proof.\u00a0 It\u00a0 is, moreover, as before stated, the\u00a0 undisputed testimony that Hawkes himself<i> said nothing whatever at the time. <\/i>\u00a0 Besides, Hawkes was himself a witness on the trial of the case,\u00a0 with\u00a0 full opportunity\u00a0 (as it appears that no objection whatever was offered to this class of evidence) to testify to the\u00a0 facts which occurred\u00a0 at\u00a0 the time\u00a0 of the indorsement\u00a0 by him, and he made no\u00a0 reference to them. Upon this branch of the case he was silent.\u00a0 This\u00a0 makes the failure of proof above referred to all the more complete and striking.<br\/><br\/>From the evidence above transcribed, which is\u00a0 substantially all of the evidence upon the subject either\u00a0 of identity or guaranty, it is apparent that the defendant Hawkes can not be held as a\u00a0 guarantor.\u00a0 There is an entire failure of evidence to support such a liability, apart from the liability of indorsement, even if parol evidence were admissible under the circumstances of this case to show it.\u00a0 The talk between Peters and the bank had before the\u00a0 arrival of Hawkes as to the necessity of Peters' obtaining a responsible person to guarantee the check was never communicated to him.\u00a0 This is shown by the evidence quoted.<br\/><br\/>The second defense presented by the defendant Hawkes is that there\u00a0 is not\u00a0 a legal\u00a0 or\u00a0 enforceable contract\u00a0 of indorsement made\u00a0 by the defendant Hawkes, but that the indorsement on said check is defective for lack of date.\u00a0 We proceed to discuss\u00a0 that question:<br\/><br\/>1. There is no law in the Philippine Islands which requires the indorsement of a check to be dated.<br\/><br\/>The claim is made by the defendant Hawkes that article 462 of the Commercial Code is applicable to the indorsement of checks.\u00a0\u00a0 The article reads as follows:<br\/><br\/>\"The indorsement must contain:<br\/><blockquote>\"1. The name and surname, firm name,\u00a0 or title of the person or company to whom or which the bill of exchange is transferred.<br\/><br\/>\"2. The form\u00a0 in\u00a0 which the assignor acknowledges the consideration\u00a0 of the\u00a0 purchaser, as\u00a0 stated\u00a0 in\u00a0 No.\u00a0 5\u00a0\u00a0 of article 444.<br\/><br\/>\"3. The name and surname, firm name,\u00a0 or title of the person from whom it is received, or to the account of whom it is charged, if it is not the same person to whom the bill of exchange is transferred.<br\/><br\/>\"4. The date on which it is drawn.<br\/><br\/>\"5. The signature of the indorser or of the person legally authorized to\u00a0 sign\u00a0 for him,\u00a0 which shall be\u00a0 stated in the subscribing clause.\"<\/blockquote>Article 461 reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"The ownership of bills of exchange shall be transferred by indorsement.\"<\/blockquote>It will be seen by a glance\u00a0 at article 461 that article 462 is expressly limited in its application to bills of exchange. If such article is applicable to checks, then the provision making it applicable must be found elsewhere than in these articles.\u00a0 The contention\u00a0 of the defendant\u00a0 is that\u00a0 such provision\u00a0 is found\u00a0 in article 533 of said code.\u00a0\u00a0 A single glance at\u00a0 said article shows\u00a0 clearly and conclusively\u00a0 that this contention can not be sustained.\u00a0 Article 533 is one of the articles found under Title XI of the Commercial Code. The heading of that title and its subscription are as follows:<br\/><blockquote><center>\"TITLE XI.<br\/><\/center> <br\/>\"Drafts, bills, and promissory notes payable to order and checks.\"\u00a0 There comes immediately\u00a0 thereafter the first subdivision of said title with its subscription, which follows:<br\/><center><br\/>\"SECTION FIRST.<br\/><\/center> <br\/>\"Drafts, bills, and promissory notes payable to order.\"<\/blockquote>It should be noted that the word \"checks,\" while appearing in the grand\u00a0 division \"Title XI\" and its\u00a0 subscription,\u00a0 is omitted in the subdivision \"Section First\" and its subscription.\u00a0\u00a0 Under\u00a0 this\u00a0 \"Section\u00a0 First\"\u00a0 are found\u00a0 only three articles, namely, 531, 532, 533, which treat, as the subscription under \"Section First\" would indicate, not of checks but of\u00a0 <i>drafts,\u00a0 bills,\u00a0 and promissory notes payable to order.<\/i><br\/><br\/>Article 533 reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"Art. 533.\u00a0 The indorsements\u00a0 on\u00a0 drafts\u00a0 and promissory notes payable to order must contain\u00a0 the same statements as those on bills of exchange.\"<\/blockquote>It is evident from\u00a0 the\u00a0 article that checks are wholly excluded from\u00a0 its operation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If\u00a0 more\u00a0 argument\u00a0 were needed to demonstrate such exclusion,\u00a0 it would be found in the fact that the second and last subdivision of \"Title XI\" <i>treats solely of checks.<\/i>\u00a0 It will be recalled that checks\u00a0 were omitted from the\u00a0 first subdivision of\u00a0 \"Title XI\" which includes article 533.\u00a0 Said second subdivision\u00a0 of \"Title XI\" and its subscription are as follows:<br\/><center><br\/>\"SECTION SECOND.<br\/><br\/>\"Checks.\"<br\/><\/center> <br\/>This\u00a0 \"Section Second\" contains\u00a0 ten articles (534-543), all relating to and treating of checks exclusively, except the last, article\u00a0 543,\u00a0 which\u00a0 refers to check\u00a0 stubs.\u00a0\u00a0 Unless authority for the claim that article\u00a0 462 is\u00a0 applicable to checks can be found somewhere\u00a0 among these ten articles, it does\u00a0 not exist.\u00a0 Counsel for\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendants does not assert that any of these articles\u00a0 provides for such an application.\u00a0\u00a0 On the contrary, he admits, by implication at least, that none of said articles makes applicable to checks the\u00a0 provisions of article 462.\u00a0\u00a0 He rests his claim to such application entirely on article 533.\u00a0 Strange to say,\u00a0 however, counsel for the plaintiff admits in his brief that article 462\u00a0 is applicable to checks and bases that admission on the provisions of article 542.\u00a0 He says in his brief\u00a0 (English, p. 6) :\u00a0 \"On the contrary, the requirement as to the dating of indorsements is limited to bills of\u00a0 exchange (art. 462), drafts and notes (art. 533)\u00a0 and checks (art. 542).\"<br\/><br\/>We can not permit such admission to influence our decision, for the reason that we\u00a0 believe\u00a0 he is wrong in the grounds upon which that admission is made.\u00a0 Article 542 follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"ART. 542. The provisions contained in this code relating to the several liability of the maker and indorsers, and to protests,\u00a0 as well as to the exercise of the actions\u00a0 arising from bills of\u00a0 exchange, shall be applicable to these instruments.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It is evident that this article in no way\u00a0 affects the question before us.\u00a0 It in no way refers to or touches the form or the essential requisites of an\u00a0 indorsement.\u00a0\u00a0 It\u00a0 has\u00a0 no affirmative\u00a0 requirements in it.\u00a0\u00a0 It does not provide that anything shall or shall not be, or shall or shall not be done. It simply makes applicable principles of\u00a0 liability already laid\u00a0 down to a state\u00a0 of things\u00a0 already\u00a0 existing.\u00a0 It\u00a0 has nothing to do with the establishment of those principles of liability; neither has it anything to do with the creation of the\u00a0 state of things to which\u00a0 it\u00a0 applies those principles. They both come to it ready\u00a0 made.\u00a0 The article simply says in effect that if a check has been drawn, and <i>if<\/i> it has\u00a0 been indorsed, then certain principles of liability shall be applied to the parties\u00a0 to the check.\u00a0 But it does not say what form such indorsement shall take or what requisites it shall have. As it has\u00a0 nothing to do with the form of the check or with the question of what are its requisites, so it has nothing to do with the form of the indorsement.\u00a0 The\u00a0 question\u00a0 is, \"Is it an indorsement?\" without regard to whether it has one form or another, that is, without regard as to whether it is made in red ink, blue ink, or black ink.\u00a0 If there is\u00a0 an indorsement, then this article\u00a0 applies certain principles to the\u00a0 responsibility of\u00a0 the parties <i>no matter whether\u00a0 the indorsement is in red, blue, or black ink.<\/i>\u00a0 In short, this article does not pretend to regulate the incidental form\u00a0 or special features of the indorsement.\u00a0 The Commercial Code recognizes as valid and legal at least two kinds of indorsement, namely, the indorsement of a bill of exchange, which bill, because of its special nature,\u00a0 requires special features in the indorsement (art. 462), and the common law indorsement,\u00a0 so called, recognized by the law merchant the world over, admittedly the indorsement which is required by the Commercial Code as to bottomry\u00a0 and respondentia bonds (art.\u00a0 722) and bills of lading\u00a0 (art. 708).\u00a0 These latter instruments, being of a nature quite different from a\u00a0 bill of exchange,\u00a0 do not require, as does said bill, any special features\u00a0 in\u00a0 their indorsement.\u00a0 Now, article 535 says:<br\/><blockquote>\"Art.\u00a0 535. The check must\u00a0 contain:<br\/><br\/>\"The name and signature of the maker, and the name\u00a0 of the person on whom it is drawn and his domicile, amount and date of\u00a0 issue, which must be written out, and if payable to bearer, to a determined person, or to order; in the latter case it shall be transferable by indorsement.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>This article says\u00a0 that a check drawn\u00a0 payable to order \"shall be transferable by indorsement.\"\u00a0 This is\u00a0 just what the code requires as to the indorsement of the bonds (art. 722)\u00a0 and of the bills of lading (art. 708), above referred to.\u00a0 Nothing whatever is said in any of these three articles, 535,\u00a0 708, 722,\u00a0 as to what requisites\u00a0 are necessary\u00a0 to constitute such indorsement.\u00a0\u00a0 No reference is made by any of them\u00a0 to article 462, and nowhere among all the articles treating\u00a0 of checks, bonds, or bills of lading, all negotiable instruments, is there any reference whatever to article 462. There being two kinds of legal and valid indorsements and the provisions of the Commercial Code relating to checks not specifying the kind required, then a check indorsed in either way would\u00a0 be validly indorsed and\u00a0 would bring it under article 542 respecting the responsibility of the parties to\u00a0 the check.\u00a0 This\u00a0 article, then,\u00a0 has no application until after the\u00a0 indorsement is completed, that is to\u00a0 say, until after it is in\u00a0 existence.\u00a0\u00a0 It can not be contended that a provision\u00a0 of law which has no\u00a0 operation or force until a given thing is in existence can have any influence whatever on\u00a0 those\u00a0 forces or\u00a0 acts or\u00a0 forms\u00a0 which bring it\u00a0 into existence.<br\/><br\/>Moreover, the article in question, 542, clearly indicates the extent of its\u00a0 application.\u00a0 It says:\u00a0 \"The\u00a0 provisions contained\u00a0 in this\u00a0 code\u00a0 relating\u00a0 to the\u00a0 several liability (garantia) of the maker and indorsers,\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\"\u00a0 Is not that reference definite and clear?\u00a0 It is\u00a0 perfectly easy to find the articles of the code\u00a0 which regulate\u00a0 and\u00a0 provide for the\u00a0 liability of\u00a0 the\u00a0 maker\u00a0 and indorsers of\u00a0 bills of exchange.\u00a0\u00a0 They are 456, 467, 516-526.\u00a0\u00a0 None\u00a0 of\u00a0 them refer to the form\u00a0 or requisites of the indorsement.\u00a0 The reason is that this article does\u00a0 not\u00a0 relate to <i>indorsement,<\/i> but to <i>liability.<\/i>\u00a0 We say\u00a0 again that this article does not begin to perform its functions <i>until after the indorsement has been made.<\/i>\u00a0 The article can not, therefore, be a cause contributing to the\u00a0 existence\u00a0 of\u00a0 the indorsement.\u00a0\u00a0 Not being a\u00a0 cause contributing to\u00a0 the\u00a0 creation of the indorsement it\u00a0 can\u00a0 have no influence on\u00a0 its nature or\u00a0 requisites. If this article had wanted to make article\u00a0 462 applicable to checks it would have read: \"The\u00a0 provisions contained in this code relating\u00a0 to <i>indorsements,<\/i>\u00a0 etc.,\" and not to the \"several liability of maker and indorsers.\"\u00a0 The article says further: \"The\u00a0 provisions contained in this code relating to the\u00a0 several liability\u00a0 of the maker and\u00a0 indorsers\u00a0 and to <i>protests,<\/i> as well as to\u00a0 the exercise of the actions\u00a0 arising from bills of\u00a0 exchange,\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\"\u00a0\u00a0 The articles\u00a0 of the code relating to protests are\u00a0 502\u00a0 and following articles; and those relating to the exercise\u00a0 of actions arising froni bills of exchange are 516-526.\u00a0 Nowhere in this article is there a reference, direct or indirect, to article 462.<br\/><br\/>2. The legitimate rules of statutory construction\u00a0 do not permit the interpretation that article 462 is applicable\u00a0 to checks.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 primal\u00a0 type of indorsement\u00a0 provided for by the Commercial Code is not essentially different from the usual indorsement\u00a0 known to the law merchant\u00a0 the world over. It seems from a careful study of the Commercial Code that that code makes\u00a0 provisions\u00a0 for\u00a0 indorsements in special forms only where the special nature of instruments of commerce requires\u00a0 it.\u00a0\u00a0 Wherever, then, we find provided by the code\u00a0 an indorsement\u00a0 having peculiar requisites and unusual features, we may confidently look for an instrument of a correspondingly peculiar nature to which that indorsement applies, and we\u00a0 may as confidently expect that such indorsement\u00a0 will be expressly restricted in its\u00a0 application to that kind\u00a0 of instrument.\u00a0 Bills of\u00a0 exchange have, under the Code of Commerce, some features not common to many other forms\u00a0 of commercial paper; and we\u00a0 find the code, therefore, providing a kind of indorsement suitable to that instrument alone.\u00a0 Articles 443 and\u00a0 444, Title X,\u00a0 define a bill of exchange and provide what it shall contain in order to be admissible in suits.\u00a0 Articles 461 and 462 define the indorsement\u00a0 which shall be made upon a bill of exchange and the features which are essential to that indorsement. These articles, also, as we\u00a0 should expect, limit the application\u00a0 of that kind\u00a0 of\u00a0 indorsement strictly <i>and expressly to bills of exchange.\u00a0 The next subject treated by the Commercial Code, after bills of exchange, is\u00a0 that of drafts,<\/i> bills, and promissory notes payable to order.\u00a0\u00a0 (Title XI, subdivision\u00a0 1.)\u00a0\u00a0 Article 531 defines drafts (<i>libranzas<\/i>), bills\u00a0 (<i>vales<\/i>), and promissory notes payable\u00a0 to\u00a0 order, and stipulates what features these instruments\u00a0 shall\u00a0 have in order to be such.\u00a0\u00a0 These instruments, by their definition and requisites, approach so closely in their nature the bill of exchange,\u00a0 that they are required, for valid transfer, to have the same indorsement as a\u00a0 bill of exchange.\u00a0\u00a0 Here again\u00a0 the\u00a0 application of article 462 to these instruments is made by <i>express provision<\/i> of the code (art.\u00a0 533 above quoted).\u00a0\u00a0 The next\u00a0 subject, immediately succeeding,\u00a0 of which the\u00a0 said code\u00a0 treats,\u00a0 is the check.\u00a0\u00a0 (Title XI, subdivision 2.)\u00a0\u00a0 Articles 534 and 535, above quoted,\u00a0 define a check\u00a0 and\u00a0 provide what features it shall have in order to be\u00a0 such.\u00a0\u00a0 Article 535\u00a0 also\u00a0 provides that checks\u00a0 payable to\u00a0 order\u00a0 \"shall\u00a0 be transferable by indorsement.\"\u00a0 Now, the code having just come from applying, by <i>express provision,<\/i>\u00a0 article 462 to the\u00a0 several different kinds\u00a0 of commercial instruments mentioned, would it not be reasonable to suppose\u00a0 that, if the code desired that article to\u00a0 be applied to checks,\u00a0 it would say so expressly as\u00a0 it did in the other cases?\u00a0 And is not the failure of the code to so provide the very clearest\u00a0 indication that it did not want\u00a0 such article so applied?\u00a0 In\u00a0 other words, in dealing with other instruments immediately\u00a0 preceding\u00a0 the subject of checks,\u00a0 the code,\u00a0 whenever it desired article 462 to be applicable, said <i>so expressly and in so many ivords.\u00a0 In dealing with checks it has not done so. <\/i> What is the inference under the common rules of statutory construction?<br\/><br\/>It is admitted that there is no provision applying article 462 to checks, such as is found in\u00a0 applying it to bills\u00a0 of exchange,\u00a0 drafts, bills,\u00a0 and promissory notes payable\u00a0 to order.\u00a0\u00a0 The most that is claimed by\u00a0 anyone,\u00a0 and that is not claimed by the defendant Hawkes in this case, is that such an application may be figured or spelled or interpreted out of the\u00a0 provisions\u00a0 of article 542.\u00a0 That such article can not be reasonably construed\u00a0 to make such application has, we believe, been\u00a0 demonstrated heretofore.\u00a0 It remains only to say that no\u00a0 court ought to interpret into the law a requirement which has for its existence no shadow of reason and which\u00a0 serves absolutely no purpose and accomplishes no result except to render more difficult and technical the ordinary transactions of commerce and to\u00a0 dig\u00a0 one more legal pitfall into\u00a0 which the\u00a0 busy man may stumble to an expensive and fruitless litigation.\u00a0 Especially should it not do so when the party benefited by such interpretation does not ask it.<br\/><br\/>The legitimate\u00a0 rules\u00a0 of statutory\u00a0 construction\u00a0 do not permit\u00a0 the application\u00a0 of\u00a0 article 462\u00a0 to checks under the facts and circumstances of this case for the further reason that the application of said\u00a0 article is\u00a0 limited to bills of exchange by <i>express provision <\/i>of law.\u00a0 That being so, its application ought\u00a0 not,\u00a0 ordinarily, to be extended except by provision of law <i>equally express. <\/i>\u00a0 Its application ought not to be extended by interpretation or construction.\u00a0\u00a0 Article 542\u00a0 admittedly\u00a0 does not\u00a0 expressly\u00a0 apply article\u00a0 462 to checks.\u00a0\u00a0 Its application is at least doubtful.\u00a0 The application of article 462, being\u00a0 limited by\u00a0 express provision of law,\u00a0 will not, under the\u00a0 circumstances of this case, be extended by article 542.<br\/><br\/>3. There\u00a0 is no\u00a0 exigency\u00a0 of business\u00a0 or\u00a0 commerce\u00a0 requiring that article 462\u00a0 should be applicable to\u00a0 checks.<br\/><br\/>The inherent\u00a0 nature of\u00a0 the provisions of article 462 of the\u00a0 Commercial\u00a0 Code\u00a0 excludes\u00a0 any\u00a0 possibility\u00a0 that the article in question\u00a0 was intended to apply to checks.\u00a0 If that article is applicable to checks at all, then every\u00a0 provision and subdivision\u00a0 thereof is applicable.\u00a0\u00a0 If any of them are found not\u00a0 to be\u00a0 applicable,\u00a0 that\u00a0 inapplicability must be grounded in some reason.\u00a0\u00a0 A glance at subdivisions 2 and 3 of said article indicates clearly that\u00a0 they are inapplicable to an indorsement of a check.\u00a0 No one\u00a0 pretends to claim that they are applicable.\u00a0\u00a0 Neither of the parties\u00a0 to this action has\u00a0 dreamed of asserting the applicability of\u00a0 those subdivisions to the check in litigation.\u00a0 If subdivision 4 is applicable, why should not be subdivisions 2 and 3?\u00a0\u00a0 There is far more reason why 2 and 3 should be applicable than why 4 should be.<br\/><br\/>While there are special reasons why the\u00a0 date should appear in the indorsement\u00a0 on a bill of exchange as provided by article 462, the reason assigned why such date should so appear is the <i>very\u00a0 reason why it should not appear in the\u00a0 indorsement\u00a0 of a\u00a0 check. <\/i>Article\u00a0 466\u00a0 provides that \"drafts not issued to order can not be indorsed, nor those which\u00a0 have <i>fallen\u00a0 due <\/i>or are\u00a0 damaged.\"\u00a0\u00a0 That\u00a0 article further provides that\u00a0 \"the transfer of ownership\u00a0 by the means acknowledged in the common law shall be licit; if, however, an indorsement is made it shall have no further force than that of a simple cession.\"\u00a0 It is evident from the provisions\u00a0 of this\u00a0 article that a person who indorses a bill\u00a0 of exchange before it is due binds himself as an indorser of the instrument by virtue of making the contract of indorsement.\u00a0 It is also\u00a0 evident that a\u00a0 person\u00a0 who indorses the instrument after it is due does not bind himself as an indorser, but merely as an assignor under the common law.\u00a0 The\u00a0 obligations\u00a0 of an\u00a0 assignor and of\u00a0 an indorser are materially different.\u00a0 Therefore\u00a0 a person who takes a bill of exchange after\u00a0 it becomes due is entitled to know which\u00a0 of the persons whose names appear upon the\u00a0 back of the bill when he takes it\u00a0 are in\u00a0 reality indorsers and which\u00a0 are merely assignors.\u00a0 In\u00a0 order that he may know this important fact, it is necessary that he know when each one of the persons made the\u00a0 indorsement which his name signifies.\u00a0 To\u00a0 give him such knowledge article 462,\u00a0 subdivision 4,\" provides that every person writing his name on the back of a\u00a0 bill of exchange must\u00a0 date his indorsement. The\u00a0 date\u00a0 on the indorsement is the means by which a purchaser of the bill after it\u00a0 becomes due shall .know who is liable as an\u00a0 indorser and who is\u00a0 liable as an assignor. <i>This is the only reason for the requirement that the indorsement on a bill of exchange must be dated.<\/i>\u00a0 It\u00a0 is evident without argument that no such reason exists in the case of a check.\u00a0 A check has no time\u00a0 within\u00a0 which it must be paid.\u00a0\u00a0 It is payable on presentation.\u00a0 There is no interval during which the drawee of the check may prepare for its payment.\u00a0 It must be paid instantly by him on presentation. There\u00a0 is no time, so far as the question we are now discussing is concerned, during which a person who indorses a check makes the contract of assignor under the common law.\u00a0\u00a0 A person writing\u00a0 his\u00a0 name\u00a0 across the back of a check is always an indorser no matter when he does it.\u00a0 A person who writes his\u00a0 name across the\u00a0 back of a check ten years after the check is drawn is just\u00a0 as liable as indorser as he would have been had he indorsed it on the very day of its issue; so\u00a0 that it makes no difference to a subsequent holder of a check\u00a0 on what dates were made the indorsements which appeared upon the check when he took it.\u00a0 The only thing about which\u00a0 the\u00a0 holder\u00a0 needs to be careful\u00a0 to\u00a0 protect himself is the five-day\u00a0 limit\u00a0 fixed by statute within which the check\u00a0 must be presented for payment.\u00a0 This five-day limit dates from the\u00a0 date of the <i>check<\/i> and not\u00a0 from the date\u00a0 of the\u00a0 indorsement.\u00a0\u00a0 The date on which the indorsement is\u00a0 made is of no consequence whatever in this connection.<br\/><br\/>The provisions of article 462 were made applicable to drafts and promissory notes\u00a0 payable to order <i>because and only because\u00a0 they are in their nature so closely allied to a bill of exchange\u00a0 as to\u00a0 make such application necessary.<\/i> The provisions of said article were not made\u00a0 applicable to checks because <i>a check in many of its essential features is so different from a\u00a0 bill of exchange as to make\u00a0 such application not only unnecessary\u00a0 and useless but\u00a0 positively harmful.<\/i><br\/><br\/>The intention of the Code of Commerce was to furnish certain\u00a0 rules and regulations, in the form\u00a0 of law, within which commerce\u00a0 and business\u00a0 might be\u00a0 carried on with safety to the property and to the investment of every person engaged\u00a0 therein.\u00a0 In the pursuit of this purpose it was not intended, by any of those rules or regulations, to impede the free intercourse of men in\u00a0 business with\u00a0 requirements which have no reason for their existence or which serve no useful purpose.\u00a0 The\u00a0 object of the code\u00a0 was to give every opportunity possible for the free, easy, quick, and safe transaction of business,\u00a0 requiring no acts which were useless and no forms not essential.\u00a0\u00a0 To require the indorsement of a check to be dated is to require\u00a0 something wholly unnecessary, useless,\u00a0 and burdensome.\u00a0 It would make no business transaction\u00a0 more safe.\u00a0 It would furnish no additional\u00a0 protection to any business man.\u00a0 It would serve no purpose for which laws are made.\u00a0 Its sole effect would be injurious\u00a0 because\u00a0 it does nothing1 but create\u00a0 one more useless\u00a0 restriction on business intercourse,\u00a0 introducing into the administration of the law of commerce\u00a0 one more technicality,\u00a0 now altogether too numerous,\u00a0 behind\u00a0 which those\u00a0 may take\u00a0 refuge\u00a0 who seek\u00a0 to\u00a0 evade their just responsibility.<br\/><br\/>If\u00a0 we\u00a0 should\u00a0 indulge\u00a0 the construction of\u00a0 article\u00a0 542 adopted\u00a0 by the court\u00a0 below, we should be going counter to the known intent and\u00a0 purpose of the Commercial Code.<br\/><br\/>We\u00a0 accordingly hold that the defendant Hawkes is liable as an\u00a0 indorser.<br\/><br\/>For the reasons above expressed it is\u00a0 adjudged\u00a0 and decreed:<br\/><ol><li>That\u00a0 the plaintiff have judgment against\u00a0 the defendants,\u00a0 F.\u00a0 C.

I., voluntarily, unlawfully, feloniously, with treachery, premeditation, vindictiveness, and nocturnity, murdered Mr. Adrian Herren,\u00a0 a\u00a0 surveyor of the Bureau of Public Lands, inflicting upon him several blows with a cutting instrument, causing numerous wounds on his shoulder, arm, neck, hand, and other parts of his body, severing his head from his body and his left arm from the shoulder, and cutting him in the middle of the right forearm; all contrary to law.\"<\/blockquote>Upon\u00a0 arraignment,\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendants pleaded not\u00a0 guilty. Before entering on the trial, the information against Fidel Veloz Was dismissed on the motion of the provincial fiscal, for the purpose of using him as a witness for the prosecution.\u00a0 The trial court found each and all of the other defendants guilty of the crime of assassination, and sentenced Romulo and Canape to death, and De la Cruz to life imprisonment, together with the accessory penalties prescribed by law.\u00a0 The record is before us now on the appeal duly taken by these three defendants from the judgment of conviction and sentence\u00a0 imposed by the lower court.<br\/><br\/>About half pasf 4 o'clock on\u00a0 the evening of the 16th of April, 1909, one Adrian Herren, a surveyor in the Bureau of Public Lands, set out from a\u00a0 place called\u00a0 Malinao, where he was engaged\u00a0 at work, for the town of Majayjay, where he was accustomed to pass the night.\u00a0\u00a0 He was accompanied by his four native assistants, the defendants in this action, the party walking in single file, Herren in\u00a0 front followed in order by Romulo, Canape, De la Cruz, and Veloz.\u00a0 When the party arrived at a clump of cane, near the\u00a0 River Dalitiwan, Romulo stepped up alongside Herren and struck him a blow with\u00a0 a hatchet which\u00a0 felled\u00a0 him face downward\u00a0 to\u00a0 the ground.\u00a0\u00a0 Immediately thereafter\u00a0 Canape struck the fallen man a number of blows on his head and body with a heavy stick, and both assailants slashed and cut\u00a0 the helpless and unconscious man with their bolos.\u00a0 The body of the deceased was at once hidden in the\u00a0 nearby clump of cane, and\u00a0 the whole party immediately set out for the town of Majayjay.<br\/><br\/>The evidence fails to disclose what participation, if any, was taken in the commission of the crime by De la Cruz and Veloz; and as to De la\u00a0 Cruz, we think that the weight of the testimony tends\u00a0 to sustain his counsel's contention that while he was present when the crime was\u00a0 committed, he took no part therein, and in nowise aided\u00a0 or abetted the assassins either by word, act, or deed.\u00a0 There is no evidence which\u00a0 would support a finding that he had any\u00a0 warning or knowledge that the sudden and unexpected attack was about to take place, or that he could have prevented it had he desired so to do; and while it affirmatively appears that Romulo and Canape\u00a0 bore\u00a0 bitter\u00a0 enmity\u00a0 and resentment against the\u00a0 deceased\u00a0 because\u00a0 of his alleged brusque and overbearing manner toward them,\u00a0 the\u00a0 evidence tends to disclose that De la Cruz and the deceased were on friendly terms\u00a0 at\u00a0 the time\u00a0 of the murder,\u00a0 and that De\u00a0 la\u00a0 Cruz had worked for the deceased for many\u00a0 years and had his confidence.\u00a0 It appears, however, that after the crime was committed,\u00a0 De\u00a0 la\u00a0 Cruz, who was\u00a0 foreman\u00a0 of\u00a0 the native party,\u00a0 was\u00a0 present when the\u00a0 body was concealed in the clump of cane, accompanied the murderers back to Majayjay, slept\u00a0 in the same house with them\u00a0 on arriving\u00a0 there, and the following morning, manifestly for the purpose of concealing the\u00a0 commission\u00a0 of the crime,\u00a0 and aiding the murderers, his companions, to escape detection and capture, voluntarily presented himself to the president of Majayjay, and\u00a0 after\u00a0 inquiring whether the president\u00a0 knew where Herren could be found, said that \"while they were putting out boundary posts or marks in Malinao about 4 o'clock of the afternoon of the day before, the American had gone ahead of them, so that the capataz and his workmen were left there until the termination of the work which had been ordered by the American.\"<br\/><br\/>The evidence of record conclusively establishes the guilt of Romulo and Canape of the crime of assassination of which they were convicted, but we do not think that it sustains a finding of\u00a0 the guilt\u00a0 of\u00a0 Celerino de la Cruz, as principal or accomplice. It does not\u00a0 appear beyond\u00a0 a\u00a0 reasonable doubt that he took any part either direct or indirect in the commission of the crime\u00a0 beyond the mere fact that he happened to be present during its execution.\u00a0 It\u00a0 does not appear that he was aware of the existence of the criminal conspiracy between Romulo and Canape before the commission of the crime, nor that there was any understanding between De la Cruz and the other members of the party in this regard.\u00a0 Without some previous concert or conspiracy as to the execution of the proposed crime, we do not think that the mere fact that De\u00a0 la Cruz happened to be present at the time when\u00a0 it\u00a0 was executed establishes his guilt as principal or as accomplice\u00a0 in its commission, there being nothing in the surrounding circumstances which would justify us\u00a0 in\u00a0 assuming that he in fact aided\u00a0 or abetted the murderers, or gave to\u00a0 them the moral support of his sympathy and advice, or in any way countenanced their act.<br\/><br\/>In its sentence of\u00a0 the 7th day of September, 1885, the supreme court of Spain held that \"The simple fact that a person accompanied another\u00a0 who intended to set\u00a0 fire to a straw deposit, which intention was unknown to the former; that he remained on one of the streets of the town while the other was setting the\u00a0 place on fire, and that he fled after the perpetration of the crime, is not sufficient to show the culpability of said person\u00a0 as a coprincipal.\"<br\/><br\/>In its sentence\u00a0 of the 22d\u00a0 of December, 1883, the same court held \"That direct instigation to commit a crime, by reason of which the instigator is considered as a principal, the same as the\u00a0 person who actually commits the crime, should be recognized only\u00a0 in a case involving acts of <i>command,<\/i> of <i>advice<\/i> sometimes, of <i>agreement,<\/i> or <i>excitation<\/i> so explicit that they may effect the criminal act, none of which are found in the words of Miguel Perez, which are alleged to have been the efficient cause of the death,\u00a0 both because important circumstances simultaneous with the affair are not clearly known (such as the respective\u00a0 position of the deceased\u00a0 and the murderer at the moment the words were pronounced, and the degree reached in the quarrel between them), and because the decision\u00a0 appealed\u00a0 from does not furnish any facts sufficiently expressed to show that Miguel might have foreseen\u00a0 the use of a firearm by his\u00a0 son, nor that,\u00a0 therefore, he might\u00a0 excite the latter\u00a0 to use it; consequently the trial court in so holding has not violated the legal\u00a0 provision cited\u00a0 by\u00a0 the\u00a0 appellant prosecutor,\u00a0 etc.\" And\u00a0 again in\u00a0 its sentence of March\u00a0 13, 1884, that \"the fact that\u00a0 a person witnessed the murder, committed by his brother, of a person\u00a0 who\u00a0 was an enemy common to both of them, with whom they had had\u00a0 some trouble previously; that,\u00a0 during\u00a0 the perpetration of the crime, he\u00a0 said some threatening words, the words not being known nor against whom they were\u00a0 directed, is\u00a0 not sufficient to\u00a0 prove his participation in the crime on the ground\u00a0 that, although the accused supplied\u00a0 a\u00a0 cause for the first trouble, and later\u00a0 on accompanied the aggressor and was present at the perpetration of the crime, pronouncing\u00a0 some threatening words,\u00a0 all as\u00a0 stated above; these isolated\u00a0 facts,\u00a0 without any other preceding ones explaining them, can not be considered as of\u00a0 great importance without grave danger\u00a0 of error, nor can\u00a0 we deduce from them any participation\u00a0 or cooperation\u00a0 in\u00a0 the criminal\u00a0 act,\u00a0 which\u00a0 is\u00a0 the\u00a0 fact\u00a0 that legally constitutes\u00a0 complicity in the case of a crime.\"<br\/><br\/>So in its sentence of the 20th of\u00a0 March, 1885:<br\/><blockquote>\"The said supreme court based its decision reversing the said judgment\u00a0 on\u00a0 the\u00a0 fact\u00a0 that, it being an indispensable element of the liability of an\u00a0 accomplice that he, by means of previous or simultaneous acts, should aid, facilitate, or protect the execution of the\u00a0 acts constituting the\u00a0 crime perpetrated by another, it does not appear from the facts stated in\u00a0 the decision that the shot fired by the aggressor at the offended party was either advised, assisted, or induced by the appellant, whose acts were merely those of intimidation or offense; therefore the trial court, by declaring the latter an accomplice of the complex crime of shooting firearms and of <i>lesiones menos graves,<\/i> acted in violation of article 15 of the\u00a0 Penal Code\"\u00a0 (art. 14\u00a0 of that of\u00a0 the Philippines.)<br\/><\/blockquote>And\u00a0 in its sentence of June\u00a0 25, 1886, it\u00a0 formally\u00a0 announced the doctrine as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Considering, in the matter of the appeal\u00a0 of Jose Martinez Atalaya, that the trial\u00a0 court finds\u00a0 him guilty as an accomplice in the commission of the crimes solely for\u00a0 the reason that he was present a.t the place where they were committed,\u00a0 at the same time acknowledging that\u00a0 he took no part in their commission;\u00a0 considering that the\u00a0 liability of an accomplice is determined by acts\u00a0 of assistance knowingly rendered to the principal before or at the time; and that the fact of being present during the\u00a0 commission\u00a0 of the crime not falling within this category,\u00a0 when it is\u00a0 not shown,\u00a0 and, for the effects of the appeal, when the lower court does not find, that such presence has for its object the encouragement of the principal, or to\u00a0 pretend,\u00a0 or to actually lend additional help: the\u00a0 declaration\u00a0 of the responsibility\u00a0 of Martinez Atalaya can\u00a0 not be thereby sustained, after it has been fully shown that between him and Juan Gomez no agreement existed,\u00a0 because, as held by the trial court, there are no prior or simultaneous acts which would demonstrate, beyond\u00a0 peradventure of doubt,\u00a0 his intention of doing or\u00a0 assisting in doing any damage in the house he entered, and thus perhaps incurring criminal liability of another kind;\u00a0 and considering the absence\u00a0 of voluntary cooperation\u00a0 on the part of Martinez Atalaya and of any appropriate overt act which\u00a0 would establish his liability the conjunction of which circumstances forms the basis of liability of the indirect principal of the\u00a0 crime, the lower court has committed an error and has violated article 15 of the Penal Code.\"<\/blockquote>This court, discussing the same question,\u00a0 has held as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"The mere presence\u00a0 of the defendant\u00a0 at the\u00a0 time\u00a0 and place of the commission of the crime is not of itself sufficient to show such an act of simultaneous\u00a0 cooperation as to make such a\u00a0 defendant an accessary to the crime.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (U.

for wise and learned men do, before they judge,\u00a0 labor to reach to the depth of all reasons of the case in question, but in their judgments express not any; and in truth, if judges should set down the reasons and causes of their judgment within every record, that immense labor would withdraw them from the necessary service of the Commonwealth, and their records should prove to be like elephantini libri, of infinite length, and in mine opinion lose somewhat of their present authority and reverence, and that is worthy for learned and grave men to imitate.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Coke, pref.\u00a0 5, p. 3.)<br\/><br\/>To\u00a0 relieve the court from\u00a0 that immense labor,\u00a0 which \"would withdraw them\u00a0 from the necessary service\" of the public, this Act of the\u00a0 Commission directs that decisions shall be of reasonable instead of\u00a0 infinite length.<br\/><br\/>It is certainly desirable in the interests of clearness and certainty\u00a0 that\u00a0 appellate courts\u00a0 should state\u00a0 the reasons upon which their decisions rest.\u00a0 The custom which gradually grew up produced that great body of\u00a0 reports from which is derived the common law of England and America, and the great value of\u00a0 which has been universally recognized by jurists and statesmen.\u00a0 Edmund Burke said that English law had \"not any other sure\u00a0 foundation, nor consequently\u00a0 the lives and property of the subject any sure hold, but in the maxims, rules,\u00a0 principles, and judicial traditionary line of decisions contained in the notes taken, and from time to time published, called reports,\" and that 'to give judgment privately is to put an end to the reports, and to put an end\u00a0 to the reports\u00a0 is to put an end to the laws of England.\"<br\/><br\/>There is of course a golden medium between judgments rendered privately\u00a0 or orally and\u00a0 the opinions of infinite length with which the courts have almost overwhelmed the legal profession.\u00a0 The correct general theory is found in this statute.\u00a0 The opinions should be in writing, and the grounds of the decision\u00a0 should be stated as briefly as may be\u00a0 consistent\u00a0 with clearness.\u00a0 But\u00a0 the exact\u00a0 form\u00a0 and manner in which decisions shall be rendered are questions of judicial\u00a0 rather than of legislative\u00a0 determination.\u00a0 No legislature has ever, so far as we have been able to learn, attempted to\u00a0 make\u00a0 the validity of a\u00a0 decision\u00a0 dependent upon the exact form in which it is expressed.\u00a0 Presumably no legislature intends to impose upon the courts conditions and\u00a0 restrictions which will render them\u00a0 incapable of performing\u00a0 their\u00a0 functions\u00a0 properly and\u00a0 efficiently.\u00a0 The results which\u00a0 would follow strict compliance with a statute of this nature may properly be taken into consideration in order to determine whether or not the Legislature intended the statute to\u00a0 be mandatory or merely directory.\u00a0 It should not be assumed in the absence of specific language to the contrary\u00a0 that a legislature intended\u00a0 that\u00a0 the\u00a0 rights\u00a0 of parties\u00a0 should be seriously affected by\u00a0 the failure of\u00a0 a court or some officer to comply strictly with the statutory requirements\u00a0 as to the manner of official action.\u00a0 Legislatures often enact statutes for the purpose of providing an orderly procedure for the conduct of public business, but procedure is secondary in importance to substantive\u00a0 rights, and\u00a0 the nonobservance of such procedure should never\u00a0 be permitted to affect substantive rights, unless the intention of the legislature is clearly expressed.\u00a0\u00a0 It is desirable that courts should\u00a0 state the grounds upon which their decisions rest, but it is possible to conceive of conditions under which strict compliance with a statute requiring\u00a0 this would\u00a0 be impracticable\u00a0 or even\u00a0 impossible.\u00a0\u00a0 Instead of protecting the interests of litigants by securing a prompt and orderly administration of the law, it would then result in obstructing or stopping the wheels of the judicial machinery, to the prejudice\u00a0 of all parties.\u00a0 There can be but one decision by any court, and it must be the result of the concurrent judgment of a majority of the justices constituting that court. The\u00a0 legislature can\u00a0 not compel\u00a0 the minds\u00a0 of men.\u00a0 The law\u00a0 has\u00a0 no mandamus to the logical\u00a0 faculty.\u00a0 It\u00a0 is not unusual for the majority of the members of a court to agree to a common conclusion, while being unable to agree upon the grounds or reasons leading\u00a0 to that conclusion.\u00a0\u00a0 Individuals have different methods of reasoning, but the conclusion of the majority of a court is the decision of the court, regardless of the views of the members as to the reasons which induce that conclusion.<br\/><br\/>A strict and literal compliance with this statute\u00a0 would often render it impossible for the court to\u00a0 decide a case. The Act declares the manner in\u00a0 which the Supreme\u00a0 Court shall\u00a0 perform the strictly judicial act of giving final expression to its decision, but it does not say that the failure to comply therewith shall render the decision ineffective. The direction is as to a matter which is not\u00a0 of the essence of the thing to be done, and there is nothing to suggest that the Legislature intended that strict compliance\u00a0 therewith should be essential to the validity of a\u00a0 decision duly and formally rendered\u00a0 in some other regular manner.\u00a0 It seems\u00a0 to be universally held that statutes of this nature are merely directory, and that compliance\u00a0 therewith\u00a0 is not necessary to the validity of the proceedings.\u00a0 A somewhat similar question arose\u00a0 in West Virginia.\u00a0 A provision in the constitution required the supreme\u00a0 court to\u00a0 \"decide every point fairly arising\u00a0 upon the record, and\u00a0 give\u00a0 its reasons therefor in writing.\"\u00a0\u00a0 This provision was held not to affect the common law doctrine of <i>res judicata<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>\"Notwithstanding that clause\u00a0 in the constitution\u00a0 [said the court] if the points are involved\u00a0 in the issue, they are <i>res judicata,<\/i> although not mentioned in the opinion of the court or noticed by\u00a0 counsel on\u00a0 either side.\u00a0 That clause of the constitution is merely directory to the court, and it ought\u00a0 to be followed; but it does in no wise change the common law rule as to the doctrine of res judicata.\u00a0 The contrary doctrine would lead to endless litigation; and no suitor\u00a0 could know when his controversy was terminated. There\u00a0 would be anything but repose in such a construction of the\u00a0 constitution as that.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Henry<i> vs. <\/i>Davis, 13 W,. Va., 230.)<br\/><br\/>Section 15 of Act No. 136\u00a0 expresses a proper rule which should be observed by the court unless there is some substantial reason for departing therefrom, but if such reason exists, the judicial action can not be controlled by legislative directions.\u00a0\u00a0 In holding that this\u00a0 statute is directory, we assume\u00a0 that the Legislature did not\u00a0 intend to control the action of the court against its judicial judgment.<br\/><br\/>There is, however, a broader ground upon which the decision may be placed.\u00a0 The doctrine is well established in the various States of the Union that\u00a0 the legislatures have no power to establish rules which operate\u00a0 to\u00a0 deprive the courts\u00a0 of their\u00a0 constitutional\u00a0 authority to exercise\u00a0 the judicial\u00a0 functions.\u00a0\u00a0 A constitutional court when exercising its proper judicial functions can no more be unreasonably controlled by the legislature than can the legislature when properly exercising legislative\u00a0 power\u00a0 be subjected\u00a0 to\u00a0 the control of the\u00a0 courts.\u00a0 Each acts independently within its exclusive field.<br\/><br\/>But counsel asserts that the courts\u00a0 of\u00a0 the Philippine Islands are not constitutional courts, and \"that Act No. 136, the Acts of Congress and the Commission are the Constitution as far as this Supreme Court is concerned.\"\u00a0 We\u00a0 are unable to accept this as a correct statement of the law.\u00a0 In\u00a0 a\u00a0 certain sense these\u00a0 courts are not constitutional courts. In a broader sense, and for the\u00a0 purposes of construing and testing the validity of the Acts\u00a0 of the Philippine\u00a0 Legislature, they are constitutional\u00a0 courts,\u00a0 because they,\u00a0 like the Legislature, exist\u00a0 by virtue of a written Organic Law enacted by\u00a0 the supreme legislative body.\u00a0 The validity of all legislative Acts must be determined by their compliance with this Organic Law, and\u00a0 the determination of the legal question of compliance\u00a0 or noncompliance\u00a0 therewith is a judicial\u00a0 question,\u00a0 which must in the\u00a0 last analysis be\u00a0 determined by the judiciary.\u00a0 This principle\u00a0 is inherent in every\u00a0 government\u00a0 organized under the\u00a0 American\u00a0 system which distributes the powers of\u00a0 government\u00a0 among\u00a0 executive,\u00a0 legislative and judicial\u00a0 departments.\u00a0\u00a0 In the <br\/>absence of a restrictive provision in the Organic Law, a grant of the legislative power means a grant of all the legislative power; and a grant of the judicial power means a grant of all the judicial power which may be exercised under the government.\u00a0 With the peculiar restrictions upon the power of the Philippine Government, which lie back of the general statement already made,\u00a0 we have no concern at the present time.\u00a0 Within the relation created by the Acts of Congress the general principles of\u00a0 American constitutional law apply whenever they can be\u00a0 made applicable.\u00a0 The motion is therefore denied.<br\/><br\/><i> Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson<\/i>, and <i>Moreland, JJ,,<\/i> concur.<br\/><\/div>",

PEDRO ALCANTARA ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br\/>\n<br\/>\nD E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">On June 25, 1907, counsel for the plaintiffs, Bernarda Aliasas et al., filed a written, amended complaint against Pedro Alcantara et al., in which it is alleged that the plaintiffs are the owners of a lot situated on Calle San Pablo of the pueblo of the same name, in the Province of La Laguna, and the owners of the house of strong material built on the land; the land is about half a hectare in extent, and is bounded on the front by the said Calle San Pablo, on the right of the entrance by the lot of Bernarda Aliasas, on the left by that of Isidro Tolentino and Agapito Aquino, and on the back by that of the church; that the said lot was acquired during the existence of the marriage between the plaintiff Bernarda Aliasas and her husband Doroteo Alinea, now deceased; that at the latter's death, one-half of the property described above belonged to the plaintiff Aliasas as having been acquired during her marriage, and the other half thereof belonged, in equal shares, to her daughter Candida and her (plaintiff's) sons, Florentino, Luis and Ambrosio Alinea, as the heirs of the deceased Doroteo Alinea, although the said property continues to be undivided; but that Ambrosio Alinea, who was in possession of the property mentioned, proceeded to sell and transfer the same to the other defendant, Pedro Alcantara, without the consent, knowledge, or authorization of his co-owners, to their grave detriment, inasmuch as the sale was made with malice and bad faith, for 480 pesos, a sum infinitely less than the true value of the property, which is assessed at 1,200 pesos; that moreover the defendants positively knew that the vendor, Ambrosio Alinea, could only dispose of one-third of one-half thereof; that, therefore, the plaintiffs have been unjustly deprived of the control and possession of the said property, through a contract executed between Ambrosio Alinea and Pedro Alcantara, to which the plaintiffs were not parties, and have suffered damages by spoliation to the amount of 1,500 pesos, through the loss of rentals and benefits; and that the vendee Alcantara, when once in possession of the property, proceeded to destroy the windows and partitions of the house and will continue to destroy the house, to the grave detriment of the plaintiffs' interests, unless he is prevented from so doing by the court, wherefore they pray that, upon their giving bond, a preliminary injunction be issued against the defendant Pedro Alcantara, restraining him from destroying the said house, and ask that the sale executed between the defendants be declared null and void with respect to the rights of the plaintiffs in the said property and that the possession of the latter be restored to the plaintiffs. The complaint further prays that the defendants be adjudged to pay Pl,500 and the costs of the trial.<br\/><br\/>The demurrer filed by the defendants against the preceding complaint having been overruled, Pedro Alcantara, in an amended answer and after excepting to the ruling of the court in rejection of the said demurrer, alleged that he denied generally and specifically all the facts set forth in the said complaint, and, as a special defense, averred that the plaintiffs, Bernarda Aliasas, Florentino Alinea, and Candida Alinea, considered the property in question to belong to the defendant Ambrosio Alinea who, for more than ten years prior to its sale to the defendant Alcantara, had been in possession of it as the exclusive owner, for which reaspn, and in view of the plaintiffs' conduct with respect to the said property, Alcantara was obliged to execute with his codefendant, Ambrosio Alinea, the contract of purchase and sale, the annulment of which is sought, and he prayed that judgment be rendered ordering the plaintiffs to respect the said contract and to pay the costs of the suit.<br\/><br\/>Even before the amended complaint had been filed, Ambrosio Alinea stated in writing, on November 23, 1906, that he denied having sold the said property to Pedro Alcantara and that he had no interest in defending himself in this suit, on account of his having a case pending decision in the Supreme Court against the said Alcantara, and asked that he be excluded from the complaint.<br\/><br\/>The case having come to trial and both parties having adduced their testimony, the documents exhibited being attached to the record, the court, on January 11, 1909, rendered judgment declaring the sale made by Ambrosio Alinea to be null and void with respect to the parts of the property that should belong to the plaintiffs, that is, to five-sixths of the house and lot in question, and valid and subsistent in favor of Pedro Alcantara with regard to the other one-sixth of the said property. The judgment contained no special finding as to costs and reserved to Pedro Alcantara the right to demand from Ambrosio Alinea the return of five-sixths of the sum paid as the value of the house.<br\/><br\/>Pedro Alcantara excepted to this judgment and, by a written motion of the 13th of January, asked for a new trial on the grounds that the findings of fact were openly and manifestly contrary to the weight of the evidence, and that the judgment was contrary to law. In view of this motion, the court, by order of March 18, 1909, and for the reasons therein contained, modified the aforesaid judgment of the 11th of January and declared the sale made by Ambrosio Alinea to be null and void with respect to the parts of the property which belong to the plaintiffs, that is, to six-eighths of the house and lot owned by them, and that the said sale was valid and subsistent in favor of Pedro Alcantara with respect to another one-eighth, and that until the rights that pertained to the deceased Luis Alinea should be determined by the proper action, the defendant Alcantara should beentitled to possess the other one-eighth of the property, which part belonged to the said deceased. No special finding was made as to the costs. Counsel for the defendant Alcantara also appealed from this modified judgment and announced his intention of filing the necessary bill of exceptions, which was duly filed and was approved, certified, and forwarded to the clerk of this court, together with the original record and the evidence taken at the trial.<br\/><br\/>Among the documents exhibited during the course of the trial there appears, as Exhibit 1, the original document written in Tagalog and presented by the defendant (p. 34 of the record) whereby it is shown that the spouses Ambrosio Alinea and Eudosia Belarmino received from Pedro Alcantara on February 21, 1903, the sum of 300 pesos which they bound themselves to repay in February of the following year, 1904, and in case they should not be able to do so, they agreed to indemnify their creditor therefor, and gave as security a lien on their house with galvanized-iron roof, situated in Calle San Pablo. The witnesses to the transaction were a brother and an uncle, who must be those named Florentino Alinea and Irineo Azucena, whose signatures appear at the foot of the instrument with those of the debtor spouses.<br\/><br\/>Page 10 of the record also shows, as Exhibit F, a copy of the instrument written in Tagalog and executed on February 29, 1904, by the same spouses, Ambrosio Alinea and Eudosia Belarmino, in which it appears that they received as a loan from Pedro Alcantara the sum of 480 pesos which they bound themselves to repay at the end of January, 1905, or else sell to the creditor for the sum loaned the house and lot owned by them which Ambrosio Alinea inherited from his father Doroteo. The witnesses to this instrument were Doroteo Belen and Potenciano Cabrera.<br\/><br\/>The previous action instituted by Pedro Alcantara against Ambrosio Alinea and wife in the court of La Laguna, for breach of contract, was decided favorably to Alcantara and the judgment rendered therein was affirmed by decision of this court in Alcantara<i> vs. <\/i>Alinea (8 Phil. Rep., 111). The claim of the defendant Alcantara in that litigation was founded on the obligation contained in the said instrument of February 29, 1904, expressive of a loan of 480 pesos, on the supposition \"that the debtors who appear therein as the obligated parties were the owners of the property which they bound themselves to sell to the creditor Alcantara in case they should not be able to pay their debt, as has occurred.<br\/><br\/>It was not alleged by the defendants in that suit, nor was it shown\u00a0 by evidence,\u00a0 that the house or property,\u00a0 the promise of sale of which was in dispute, was the common and undivided property of the widow and heirs of the deceased Doroteo Alinea.<br\/><br\/>The object of the present suit is to obtain from the courts the explicit declaration that the sale of the property in question is null and void, in so far as it affects and injures the rights of the widow and other coheirs of the vendor, Ambrosio Alinea, notwithstanding the executory judgment obtained by the herein defendant, Pedro Alcantara, in the previous suit for breach of contract. The said executory judgment is, indeed, binding on Ambrosio Alinea, but it can not affect the rights of his mother and coheirs, inasmuch as they were not parties to the contract aforesaid, nor are they obliged to fulfill the same.<br\/><br\/>The record shows it to be fully proved that the property concerned was acquired in May, 1895, during the lifetime of Doroteo Alinea and while his wife was still living, from Sotero Bautista for the sum of 550 pesos, which sale was executed in the court of San Pablo before the <i>capitan municipal<\/i>, his secretary and witnesses. It can not, therefore, be doubted that the property in question was transferred by the parents of Ambrosio Alinea, and, as it was acquired by the former during the conjugal partnership, it now belongs to the widow and heirs of the deceased Doroteo Alinea.<br\/><br\/>The rights to a person's succession are transmitted from the moment of his death, and thus it is that the heirs of the deceased, by the mere fact of his death, succeed to all his rights and obligations,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Arts. 657, 661, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>The defendant, notwithstanding his having denied in his answer all the facts alleged in the complaint, withal admits implicitly that the house and lot in question belonged exclusively to Doroteo Alinea and the latter's wife, Bernarda Aliasas, and that, when Doroteo Alinea died on June 27, 1899, the rights of the deceased were, in fact, and by operation of law, transmitted to the four children of the latter, Plorentino, Luis, Candida, and Ambrosio Alinea. Such admission arises from the fact that the first and second errors, imputed by the appellant Alcantara to the judgment appealed from, consist in the averment that the court erred by not declaring that the real and personal property left at his death, by Doroteo Alinea, was adjudicated to and divided between his widow, Bernarda Aliasas, and his four children, and that the court also erred by not declaring that, by virtue of such partition, the house and lot claimed in the complaint, and included in the property left by the deceased, belonged to Ambrosio Alinea.<br\/><br\/>It was asserted by the plaintiffs that the said house and lot, as property left by the deceased Doroteo Alinea, were as yet undivided and unallotted to his widow and heirs, and the record shows no proof of any kind to the contrary, to wit, that such partition was made and that the said house and lot fell to Ambrosio Alinea, notwithstanding the intention and purposes of the defendant Alcantara, who knowingly acquired the whole of the property when he was aware that it was not exclusively owned by the seller, Ambrosio Alinea, but belonged in common to the widow and heirs of its previous owner. The defendant should not have been ignorant of the fact that only a division legally made of hereditary property can confer upon each heir the exclusive ownership of the property which may have been awarded to him. (Art. 1068, Civil Code.) The defendant was unable to prove such a partition.<br\/><br\/>Pedro Alcantara could not have believed that Ambrosio Alinea was the sole and legitimate owner of the said house and lot, because, aside from the fact that he could and should have made the proper investigations prior to his having accepted the said property as security for the money he loaned to Ambrosio Alinea, and without assenting to a mere statement made by the latter, it is conclusively shown that he received from his debtor, and had in his possession, the deed of the property, which the original owner, Doroteo Alinea, obtained on purchasing the property. By a perusal of the said deed, before exhibiting it in the justice of the peace court of San Pablo for the purpose of obtaining the ejection of his debtor, Ambrosio Alinea, in order that the latter might abandon and remove from the property given as security for his unsettled debt, the defendant would have learned that the said property came from the deceased father of the debtor, Ambrosio Alinea, and therefore then belonged in common, and <i>pro indiviso<\/i>, to the widow of the deceased and to his heirs, and that, at most, Ambrosio Alinea was only the owner of one-eighth of the said property or of that part of its value.<br\/><br\/>In the record of the proceedings in the court of the justice of the peace of San Pablo there is found, on page 18, a true copy of the title deed to the property before referred to, and inasmuch as that record shows, on page 12, that the court certified to the authenticity and exactness of the said proceedings, including the copy of the deed mentioned, unless this deed be impugned as false and proved so to be, it would be unjust and improper to reject it or to fail to recognize its validity in this action, especially since the defendant Alcantara did not see fit to exhibit the original deed which was delivered to him by his debtor. It is to be regretted that the official who copied the deed of transfer did not record at the bottom, among other details called for by the old laws then in force in this country, the name of the person to whom the original was delivered or returned. If he had done so, it would be known with certainty who is now in possession of the original instrument.<br\/><br\/>The possession of the said house and lot, which Ambrosio Alinea has been ostensibly enjoying since the death of his father Doroteo, can not have created a right in favor of the possessor, inasmuch as, the property remaining in a condition of <i>pro indiviso<\/i>, the said possession by Ambrosio Alinea over the property of common ownership is understood to be that held by him as an heir and in the name of his mother and the other coheirs, for as one of the latter he could not hold it exclusively for the purposes of prescription, since common <i>pro indiviso<\/i> property can not be acquired by a coheir through prescription.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Art. 1965, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>On the grounds just above related, Ambrosio Alinea could not legally dispose of the whole of the said property, nor deprive his mother and the coheirs of their unquestionable rights in the same, and, consequently, he could not transfer to Pedro Alcantara any right in the property yet undivided save only such as he has to a one-eighth part of the said house and lot. The sale or transfer, therefore, made by the said Ambrosio Alinea in favor of the defendant Alcantara, of the remaining seven-eighths of the property referred to, is absolutely null and void.<br\/><br\/>For the reasons herein stated, it has been fully shown that the assignments of error alleged against the judgment of the court below are entirely unfounded.<br\/><br\/>It is to be noted that, in the judgment appealed from, the question raised by the petition relative to damages was not decided, and that, also, it was ordered that the defendant Alcantara might continue in the possession of one-eighth part of the property in question until the rights which pertained to the deceased Luis Alinea should be decided by the courts. Withal, the said judgment appears to have been acquiesced in, with respect to these points, by the plaintiff appellee.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, and accepting those set forth in the judgments appealed from, it is proper, in our opinion, to affirm, as we do hereby affirm, the said judgments, with the costs against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

JOSE SANTOS, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/>\n<br\/>\nD E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">Between 9 and 10 o'clock of\u00a0 the night of April 4,\u00a0 1909, Mr. John\u00a0 W. Willey, accompanied by a\u00a0 friend of his, Mr. Corliss, after having been a little while in the basement of the\u00a0 house where\u00a0 they lived, in\u00a0 which\u00a0 there was a\u00a0 bar, started out, in order to see the people passing in the street, in the direction of the cockpit, where there was a cinematograph in operation at the time.\u00a0 After seeing a few motion pictures, and at the end of the performance, they left the premises\u00a0 and started home; but, on\u00a0 passing near Jose Santos, who was then standing in the street and carrying a cane\u00a0 and\u00a0 a bolo, the latter caught hold of Willey's right arm, asking him where he was going, to which Willey replied by asking Santos in turn why he wished to know.\u00a0 At this moment Santos took a step backward, and with his right hand\u00a0 seized the bolo which he had been holding in his left. Thereupon Willey asked him whether that was not a public place.\u00a0\u00a0 Santos replied that it was\u00a0 not and that it belonged to him and ordered Willey to return by the same road over which he\u00a0 had come with his\u00a0 companion.\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the threatening attitude of Jose Santos, Willey requested that the former deliver to him the bolo that he had, as a precautionary measure to prevent Santos from wounding him with it, but the latter raised\u00a0 his\u00a0 bolo and immediately gave Willey a cut, inflicting in his right cheek a wound which extended from the ear to the mouth, knocking out one of the eyeteeth and breaking one upper and two lower front teeth. Wherefore Willey and his companion started off on a run toward their house where, shortly afterwards, the wounded man was attended by Doctor Silva, who was called for the purpose, and on the following day he was removed from Calamba to the Civil Hospital of this city, where\u00a0 he remained for treatment of\u00a0 his wounds until the end of\u00a0 the 23d day of April.\u00a0\u00a0 On the following day,\u00a0 the 24th, he returned to his house, where he continued under\u00a0 medical treatment without being able to work until the 7th of May of that year, according\u00a0 to the certificate of the physician who attended him, Exhibits A and B.\u00a0\u00a0 The said wound\u00a0 caused a scar of about 5 inches\u00a0 in length, from the\u00a0 ear to the mouth,\u00a0 as stated by\u00a0 the offended party, page 9 of the record.\u00a0 Dr. Silva\u00a0 asserted that this scar was permanent\u00a0 and that it might contract in width, but could not in length.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons,\u00a0 a complaint was filed\u00a0 in the Court of First Instance of La Laguna, by the acting provincial fiscal, charging Jose Santos with the crime of <i>lesiones graves.<\/i>\u00a0 The case having come to trial, the judge, in view of the evidence adduced therein, rendered judgment\u00a0 on the 18th\u00a0 of November,\u00a0 1909,\u00a0 sentencing the\u00a0 accused to the penalty of one year and one day's <i>prision correccional<\/i>, to the accessory penalties, to indemnify the offended party, Mr. Willey, in the sum of\u00a0 P100, and, in case of insolvency, to suffer the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment, and to pay the costs.\u00a0\u00a0 From this judgment the defendant appealed.<br\/><br\/>From the facts related, duly proved in the present\u00a0 cause, it follows that the crime of <i>lesiones graves<\/i> was in\u00a0 fact committed\u00a0 upon the person of John W. Willey,\u00a0 inspector of telephones, which crime is provided\u00a0 for and\u00a0 punished\u00a0 by article 416, No. 3, of the Penal Code, as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"He who shall wound, bruise, or maltreat another shall be punished as guilty of causing serious physical injuries; with the penalty of <i>prision correccional<\/i> in its minimum and medium degrees if, as the result of such injuries, the person assaulted should have been\u00a0 deformed,\u00a0 or had lost a member not a principal one, or should have it rendered useless, or should have been, for a period of more than\u00a0 ninety days, ill or disabled for\u00a0 his usual occupation.\"<\/blockquote>As\u00a0 a\u00a0 result of the assault and of the wound inflicted upon the offended party in the\u00a0 right\u00a0 cheek from the ear\u00a0 to the mouth, one of his eyeteeth fell out and a front tooth and two other lower teeth were broken, and after more than\u00a0 thirty days'\u00a0 treatment, during which time he was incapacitated from\u00a0 work, a long scar was left on his face which makes a visible and very noticeable deformity.\u00a0 On account of such deformity, as well as because of the\u00a0 loss and breaking of an eyetooth and other teeth of the injured\u00a0 party, and because of the number of days\u00a0 he was unable to work, the crime charged is one of a serious nature and is comprised within article 416, No, 3,\u00a0 of The Penal\u00a0 Code, inasmuch as the offended party was left deformed, lost an eyetooth and in a certain manner the use of other teeth, which appendages form a part of the mouth, a principal organ of the human body.\u00a0\u00a0 For the due classification\u00a0 of the crime of lesiones, in accordance\u00a0 with the provisions of the Penal Code, it is not sufficient to take account of the number of days of treatment of the wounds or of the incapacity to work; the injury occasioned and the consequences of the wound received by the offended party must also be considered.\u00a0 For this reason, the\u00a0 preinserted article was divided into four\u00a0 paragraphs, with the\u00a0 specification of each\u00a0 case and. the\u00a0 penalty corresponding\u00a0 to each of them.\u00a0 Considering the nature and consequences of the\u00a0 serious wound received by the offended party, Willey, in the right side of his face, it is unquestionable that this wound, though healed in thirty days, produced a noticeable deformity of his features,\u00a0 aside from the loss and damage of a part of\u00a0 his teeth, which results require the imposition of a more severe penalty than for a mere lesion grave not attended by these circumstances.<br\/><br\/>The guilt of\u00a0 the accused, Jose Santos, as the sole author, by direct\u00a0 participation, of the\u00a0 crime of lesiones graves, is manifest,\u00a0 for, notwithstanding his unsupported exculpatory allegations, the record of the case furnishes conclusive proof of his guilt.\u00a0 Nor can his plea of self-defense be accepted, since it was not proved at the trial that the wounds inflicted were preceded\u00a0 by an unlawful assault\u00a0 on\u00a0 the\u00a0 part of\u00a0 the victim, nor\u00a0 did the latter even insult\u00a0 him;\u00a0 On\u00a0 the other hand it has been shown,\u00a0 beyond all per adventure of doubt, that the defendant, on leaving the cockpit where there was a cinematographic performance, took away from a neighbor a bolo the latter was carrying, without any cause or reason why he should have provided himself with a bolo on that night, and while the offended party and a companion of his were passing near him,\u00a0 the defendant, again without any motive whatever, seized Willey by the arm, asking him where he was going, and\u00a0 as the\u00a0 latter\u00a0 in turn\u00a0 asked\u00a0 the defendant why he wished to know and whether\u00a0 the\u00a0 place where he was\u00a0 passing was not a public one, the accused took\u00a0 a step backward, passed the bolo\u00a0 he was carrying into\u00a0 his right hand and answered that it was not a public one and that the said place belonged to him.\u00a0 He then ordered Willey to return by the same road over which he\u00a0 had come,\u00a0 and in view of the threatening attitude\u00a0 of\u00a0 the accused,\u00a0 Willey requested the latter to deliver to him the bolo as a precautionary measure against an assault; whereupon the accused attacked Willey, giving him a cut in the right cheek.\u00a0 All these facts, affirmed by the injured party, were corroborated by his companion, Mr. Corliss, and two other\u00a0 eyewitnesses; wherefore it is undeniable that the defendant, after\u00a0 having provoked the offended party, assaulted him without\u00a0 a sufficient rational motive and without prior assault on the part of the said Willey.<br\/><br\/>It is alleged that the offended party, on demanding of the accused the delivery of the bolo, addressed insulting words to the latter, and\u00a0 that when Santos\u00a0 pushed him,\u00a0 Willey brought his hand to his pocket as if he were about to draw a revolver.\u00a0 Aside from the fact that it was not proved that Willey insulted\u00a0 the defendant on\u00a0 demanding of him\u00a0 the delivery of the bolo, as a precaution, in view of the threatening attitude of the accused, and of the fact that the offended party was not then carrying a revolver, the request for the delivery of the bolo, although understood by\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant Santos to be a threat, can in nowise be called such\u00a0 an\u00a0 unlawful assault or act\u00a0 as might provoke in return\u00a0 an\u00a0 act of legitimate defense.<br\/><br\/>In\u00a0 order that the aggressor may allege in his behalf\u00a0 a plea of self-defense, it is absolutely essential,\u00a0 as a principal element thereof, that such defense shall have been preceded by an overt attack, which the record does not\u00a0 show to have occurred in the present case, for had the\u00a0 accused\u00a0 not seized Mr. Willey by the arm and tried to compel him, in a\u00a0 hostile manner and while provided\u00a0 with a bolo, to return the same way he had come, without any right whatever, as\u00a0 they were both on a public highway, Willey would not have\u00a0 asked the bolo of him as a wise precaution against an assault\u00a0 which, in fact, did take place.<br\/><br\/>There are no aggravating nor mitigating circumstances in connection with the\u00a0 commission\u00a0 of the crime;\u00a0 wherefore the penalty should be imposed in\u00a0 the medium degree.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, whereby the\u00a0 errors\u00a0 alleged have been disposed\u00a0 of,\u00a0 it\u00a0 is\u00a0 our opinion that\u00a0 the judgment appealed from must be affirmed, with the proviso, however, that the defendant shall be sentenced\u00a0 to the penalty of\u00a0 one year eight\u00a0 months and\u00a0 twenty-one\u00a0 days'\u00a0 <i>prision correctional<\/i>, and to\u00a0 pay the costs of this\u00a0 instance.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Moll, Kunzli &amp; Co., in\u00a0 Manila, are constantly instructing Mr. Hering to make out his invoices other than in the manner prescribed by our regulations, and has caused this office\u00a0 much\u00a0 unnecessary\u00a0 annoyance\u00a0 and work.\u00a0\u00a0 For instance, in this case,\u00a0 he\u00a0 was\u00a0 instructed by the Manila firm to leave out his commission, notwithstanding that we have always demanded that the same must be stated in the invoice.<br\/><br\/>\"In future Mr. Hering's invoices shall be carefully\u00a0 scrutinized, so that such\u00a0 oversight may not occur again.\u00a0\u00a0 I am, sir,<br\/><br\/><div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\"Very respectfully yours,<br\/><\/div><br\/><div style=\"text-align: right;\">\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\"______________________<br\/><\/div><div style=\"text-align: right;\">\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"<i>Consul-General<\/i>\"<\/div><\/blockquote>We do not believe\u00a0 that it ought to be laid\u00a0 down as a general rule that an\u00a0 importer may not have the right to correct a mistake made in a sworn statement to the customs officials concerning the relations which he\u00a0 sustains to\u00a0 the person from whom he receives the goods.\u00a0\u00a0 We do not believe that such a statement is conclusive against him.\u00a0\u00a0 We\u00a0 are convinced that does not work an<i> estoppel in pais<\/i>.\u00a0 Whether or not a correction will be permitted in a given case <i>must depend upon\u00a0 the facts of that case.<\/i>\u00a0\u00a0 Whether or not\u00a0 one is estopped from asserting something contrary to what he has theretdfore\u00a0 stated or asserted depends on\u00a0 conditions. The\u00a0 doctrine\u00a0 of estoppel can be\u00a0 stated only in the most general terms.\u00a0\u00a0 This is its particular characteristic.\u00a0 It is impossible to lay down a rule to cover all cases.<br\/><br\/>To arrive at a conclusion in this case it is necessary to consider only the facts of this case.\u00a0 Whether or not a correction will be permitted depends, among other things, upon (1)\u00a0 the\u00a0 good faith of the party seeking the change, that is, whether it is a real mistake or a simulated one; upon (2) the promptitude\u00a0 with\u00a0 which the request\u00a0 for correction is presented; and (3) upon whether or\u00a0 not injury will result to anyone if the change is permitted.<br\/><br\/>The fact that the relations between\u00a0 the appellants and Cuno Hering are stated under oath\u00a0 by appellants is not of itself conclusive against them.\u00a0 One may make an honest mistake\u00a0 under oath as well as\u00a0 in an unsworn\u00a0 statement. Neither is it conclusive that the appellants and Cuno Hering agreed in their description of the relations between them. Men may,\u00a0 and frequently do, mistake\u00a0 the relation which they bear\u00a0 to each\u00a0 other.\u00a0 These\u00a0 are simply facts which must be considered\u00a0 and weighed\u00a0 in\u00a0 determining\u00a0 whether as a matter of justice and equity, upon\u00a0 the whole case, the correction ought to be permitted.<br\/><br\/>For these reasons the authorities cited by the contending counsel, while significant and helpful, can not have weight here.\u00a0 The facts in\u00a0 those cases are not the\u00a0 same or substantially the same as in the case at bar.<br\/><br\/>The Government has no ready means of knowing the real relations between the shipper and the importer <i>except by the\u00a0 testimony of these persons themselves.\u00a0 <\/i> They themselves are the only ones who\u00a0 know the facts from which those relations spring.\u00a0 The evidence of that relationship they alone possess.\u00a0\u00a0 The Government\u00a0 is, in a way, at their mercy in this regard.\u00a0 Therefore, when they solemnly and formally state under oath what these relations are, a presumption of more than usual strength and tenacity arises. that they are stating the truth and the fact, <i>especially when in such statement they speak\u00a0 against their\u00a0 own interests.<\/i> If, later,\u00a0 they return to vary that statement, thereby regaining what their previous statement lost them, their evidence of mistake will be scanned with\u00a0 the very closest scrutiny. If in it there appears any flaw or\u00a0 weakness, or if, in the whole case as presented, there appears any reason to doubt the good faith which they ought to exercise in dealing with the Government, the right to change will be denied them.<br\/><br\/>Greenleaf says in his Treatise on\u00a0 Evidence, paragraph 210:<br\/><blockquote>\"PAR.\u00a0 210.\u00a0 In some other cases,\u00a0 connected with the administration of public justice and of government, the admission is held conclusive, on grounds of public policy.\u00a0 Thus, in an action on the statute against bribery,\u00a0 it was held that a man who had given money to another for his vote should not be admitted to say that such other person had no right to vote.\u00a0 So, one who has officiously intermeddled with the goods of another, recently deceased, is, in favor of creditors, estopped to deny that he is executor.\u00a0\u00a0 Thus, also, where a shipowner, whose ship had been seized as forfeited for breach of the revenue laws, applied to the Secretary of the Treasury for a remission\u00a0 of forfeiture, on the ground that it was incurred by the master ignorantly, and without fraud, and, upon\u00a0 making\u00a0 oath to the application,\u00a0 in the\u00a0 usual course, the ship was given up, he was not permitted afterwards to gainsay it and prove the misconduct of the master, in an action by the latter\u00a0 against the owner for his wages, on the same\u00a0 voyage, even by showing that the fraud had subsequently\u00a0 come to his\u00a0 knowledge.\u00a0\u00a0 The mere fact that an admission\u00a0 was made under oath\u00a0 does\u00a0 not seem alone to render it conclusive against the party, but it adds vastly to the weight of the\u00a0 testimony,\u00a0 throwing upon him.the burden of showing that it was a case of clear and innocent mistake.\u00a0\u00a0 Thus,\u00a0 in a\u00a0 prosecution under\u00a0 the\u00a0 game\u00a0 laws, proof of\u00a0 the defendant's oath, taken under the Income Act, that the yearly value of his estates was less than \u00a3100, was held not\u00a0 quite conclusive against\u00a0 him, though very strong evidence\u00a0 of the fact.\u00a0\u00a0 And even\u00a0 the defendant's belief of a fact, sworn to in an answer in chancery, is admissible at law, as evidence against him of the fact,\u00a0 though not conclusive.\"<\/blockquote>We do not feel like disturbing the conclusion of the Collector of\u00a0 Customs in this\u00a0 particular case.\u00a0 He dealt with the parties at first hand, was thoroughly\u00a0 acquainted with the system in operation, was deeply schooled in the methods and arts of those who seek to impose upon the Government in the matter of customs duties.\u00a0 He listened to the protest, observed the conduct of the parties, and weighed the evidence presented.\u00a0\u00a0 He drew his conclusions from the whole case; and, while the declarations under oath\u00a0 of the\u00a0 appelants and Hering are not conclusive against them, still we are\u00a0 satisfied from the whole case that the\u00a0 Collector of Customs in\u00a0 concluding that they have failed to meet and overcome satisfactorily the burden of\u00a0 proof\u00a0 which those declarations laid upon them was fully justified.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below is, therefore, affirmed, with costs against\u00a0 the appellants.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i> Arellano, C, J., Torres, Mapa, Johnson, <\/i>and <i>Carson, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><\/div>",

Finding on inquiry that Mr. Murphy was not in his quarters, the\u00a0 boys, impelled\u00a0 apparently by youthful curiosity and\u00a0 perhaps\u00a0 by the unusual interest which both seem to have taken in machinery, spent\u00a0 some time in wandering about the company's\u00a0 premises.\u00a0 The\u00a0 visit was\u00a0 made on a Sunday afternoon, and it does not appear\u00a0 that they saw or spoke to anyone after leaving the power house where they had asked for Mr. Murphy.<br\/><br\/>After watching the operation of the traveling crane used in handling the defendant's\u00a0 coal, they walked across\u00a0 the open\u00a0 space in\u00a0 the\u00a0 neighborhood of the place\u00a0 where\u00a0 the company dumped the cinders and ashes from its furnaces. Here they found some twenty or thirty brass fulminating caps scattered\u00a0 on the ground.\u00a0 These caps are approximately of the size and appearance of small pistol cartridges and each has attached to it two long thin wires by means of which it may be discharged by the use of electricity. They\u00a0 are intended\u00a0 for\u00a0 use in the explosion of blasting charges of dynamite, and have in themselves a considerable explosive power.\u00a0 After some discussion as to the ownership of the\u00a0 caps, and their right\u00a0 to take them, the boys picked up all they\u00a0 could find,\u00a0 hung them on a stick,\u00a0 of which each took one end, and carried\u00a0 them home.\u00a0 After crossing the footbridge, they met a little girl named Jessie Adrian, less than 9\u00a0 years old, and all three went\u00a0 to the home\u00a0 of\u00a0 the boy Manuel.\u00a0 The boys\u00a0 then made a series of experiments\u00a0 with the caps.\u00a0\u00a0 They thrust the ends\u00a0 of the wires into\u00a0 an electric\u00a0 light socket and obtained\u00a0 no result.\u00a0 They next tried to break the\u00a0 cap with a stone and failed.\u00a0\u00a0 Manuel\u00a0 looked for a hammer,\u00a0 but could not find one.\u00a0 They then opened one of the caps with a knife, and finding\u00a0 that it\u00a0 was filled with a\u00a0 yellowish substance they got\u00a0 matches, and\u00a0 David\u00a0 held the cap\u00a0 while Manuel applied a lighted match to the contents.\u00a0\u00a0 An\u00a0 explosion followed,\u00a0 causing more or less serious injuries to all three. Jessie,\u00a0 who,\u00a0 when the boys\u00a0 proposed\u00a0 putting a\u00a0 match\u00a0 to the contents of the cap,\u00a0 became frightened and started\u00a0 to run away, received a slight cut in\u00a0 the\u00a0 neck.\u00a0 Manuel had his hand\u00a0 burned and wounded, and David was struck\u00a0 in the face by several particles of the metal capsule, one\u00a0 of which\u00a0 injured his right eye to such an\u00a0 extent as to\u00a0 necessitate its\u00a0 removal by the surgeons who were called in to care for his\u00a0 wounds.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 evidence does\u00a0 not definitely and conclusively disclose how the caps came to be on the defendant's\u00a0 premises, nor how long\u00a0 they had been\u00a0 there when the boys found them. It appears, however,\u00a0 that some months\u00a0 before the accident, during the construction of the defendant's plant, detonating caps of the same size and kind as those found by the boys were used in sinking a well at the power plant near the place\u00a0 where\u00a0 the caps were\u00a0 found; and it\u00a0 also appears that at or about the time when these caps were\u00a0 found, similar caps were in use in the construction of an extension of defendant's street car line to Fort\u00a0 William McKinley. The\u00a0 caps when found appeared to the boys who picked them up to have been lying there for a considerable time, and\u00a0 from the\u00a0 place where they were\u00a0 found would seem to have\u00a0 been\u00a0 discarded as\u00a0 defective or worthless\u00a0 and fit only to be thrown upon the rubbish heap.<br\/><br\/>No measures seem to have been adopted by the defendant company to prohibit or prevent visitors from entering and walking\u00a0 about\u00a0 its\u00a0 premises unattended, when they\u00a0 felt disposed so to\u00a0 do.\u00a0 As\u00a0 admitted\u00a0 in defendant counsel's brief, \"it is undoubtedly\u00a0 true that children in\u00a0 their play sometimes crossed the footbridge to the island;\" and, we may add, roamed about at will on the uninclosed premises of the defendant, in the neighborhood\u00a0 of the place where the caps were\u00a0 found.\u00a0 There is no evidence\u00a0 that any effort ever was made\u00a0 to forbid\u00a0 these children from visiting the defendant company's premises, although it must\u00a0 be assumed that the company\u00a0 or its employees were aware of the fact that they not infrequently\u00a0 did\u00a0 so.<br\/><br\/>Two\u00a0 years\u00a0 before the accident, plaintiff spent\u00a0 four months at sea,\u00a0 as a cabin boy\u00a0 on\u00a0 one of the interisland transports.\u00a0 Later he took up work in his\u00a0 father's office, learning mechanical drawing and mechanical engineering. About a\u00a0 month after his accident he obtained employment as a mechanical draftsman and\u00a0 continued in that employment for six\u00a0 months at a salary of P2.50\u00a0 a day; and it appears that he was a boy\u00a0 of more than average intelligence, taller and more mature\u00a0 both mentally and physically than most boys of fifteen.<br\/><br\/>The facts set out in the foregoing statement are to our mind fully and conclusively established by the evidence of record, and are substantially admitted by counsel.\u00a0 The only questions of\u00a0 fact\u00a0 which are\u00a0 seriously disputed\u00a0 are plaintiff's allegations that the caps which\u00a0 were found by plaintiff\u00a0 on defendant company's premises were the property of the defendant,\u00a0 or that they had\u00a0 come\u00a0 from its possession and control, and that the company or some of its employees\u00a0 left them exposed on\u00a0 its premises\u00a0 at\u00a0 the point where they were found.<br\/><br\/>The evidence in support of these allegations is meager, and the\u00a0 defendant company, apparently relying\u00a0 on the rule of law\u00a0 which places the burden\u00a0 of proof of such allegations upon the plaintiff, offered no evidence in rebuttal, and insists that plaintiff failed\u00a0 in\u00a0 his proof.\u00a0 We think, however, that\u00a0 plaintiff's evidence is\u00a0 sufficient to sustain a finding in accord with his allegations in this regard.<br\/><br\/>It was proven that caps, similar to those found by plaintiff, were used, more or less\u00a0 extensively,\u00a0 on the McKinley extension of the defendant company's track; that some of these caps were used in blasting a\u00a0 well on the company's premises a few months before the\u00a0 accident;\u00a0 that not\u00a0 far from the place where\u00a0 the\u00a0 caps\u00a0 were found the company has a storehouse for\u00a0 the materials,\u00a0 supplies, and so forth, used by\u00a0 it in its operations as a\u00a0 street railway and\u00a0 a purveyor of electric light;\u00a0 and\u00a0 that the place, in the neighborhood\u00a0 of\u00a0 which\u00a0 the caps were found, was\u00a0 being used by the company as\u00a0 a sort of\u00a0 dumping ground for ashes and cinders.\u00a0\u00a0 Fulminating caps or detonators for the discharge by electricity\u00a0 of blasting\u00a0 charges\u00a0 by dynamite are not articles in common use by\u00a0 the average citizen, and under all the circumstances, and in the\u00a0 absence of all evidence to the contrary, we think that\u00a0 the discovery of\u00a0 twenty or thirty\u00a0 of these\u00a0 caps\u00a0 at the place where they\u00a0 were found by the\u00a0 plaintiff on defendant's\u00a0 premises fairly justifies the inference that the\u00a0 defendant company was either the owner of the caps in\u00a0 question or had these caps under its possession and control.\u00a0 We think also that the evidence <i> tends<\/i> to\u00a0 disclose that these caps or detonators were willfully and knowingly\u00a0 thrown\u00a0 by\u00a0 the company or its\u00a0 employees at the\u00a0 spot where\u00a0 they were found, with the expectation that\u00a0 they would\u00a0 be buried out of sight by the ashes which\u00a0 it\u00a0 was engaged in dumping in that neighborhood,\u00a0 they being old and perhaps defective; and, however this may be,\u00a0 we are satisfied that the evidence\u00a0 is sufficient to sustain a\u00a0 finding that the company or some of its employees either willfully or through an oversight left them exposed at a point on its premises which the general public, including children at play, were not prohibited from visiting, and over which the company knew or ought to have known that young boys were likely to roam about in pastime or in play.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for appellant endeavors to weaken or destroy the probative value of the facts on which these conclusions are based by intimating or rather assuming that the blasting work on the company's\u00a0 well and on its McKinley extension was done by contractors.\u00a0 It was conclusively proven, however, that while the workman employed in blasting the well was regularly employed by J. G.\u00a0 White &amp;\u00a0 Co., a firm of contractors, he did the\u00a0 work on the well directly and immediately under the supervision and control of\u00a0 one of defendant company's foremen, and there is no proof whatever in the record that the blasting on the McKinley extension was done by <i>independent contractors. <\/i>\u00a0 Only\u00a0 one witness testified upon this point, and while he stated that he understood that a part of this work was done by\u00a0 contract,\u00a0 he could not say so of his\u00a0 own knowledge, and knew nothing of the terms and conditions of the alleged contract, or of the relations of the alleged contractor to the defendant company.\u00a0 The fact having been proven that detonating caps were more or less extensively employed\u00a0 on\u00a0 work done by the defendant company's directions and\u00a0 on\u00a0 its behalf, we think that the company should have introduced\u00a0 the necessary evidence to support its contention if it wished to avoid the not unreasonable inference that it was the owner of the material used\u00a0 in these operations and that it\u00a0 was responsible for tortious or negligent\u00a0 acts of the agents employed therein, on the ground\u00a0 that this work had been\u00a0 intrusted to <i>independent contractors <\/i> as to\u00a0 whose acts the maxim <i>respondeat superior <\/i>should not be applied. If the company did not in fact own\u00a0 or make\u00a0 use of\u00a0 caps\u00a0 such as\u00a0 those found on its premises,\u00a0 as intimated by\u00a0 counsel, it was\u00a0 a very simple matter for it to\u00a0 prove that fact, and in the absence of such proof we think that the\u00a0 other evidence in the record sufficiently establishes the contrary, and justifies the court in drawing the reasonable inference that the caps found on\u00a0 its premises were\u00a0 its property, and\u00a0 were left where they were found by the company or some\u00a0 of its employees.<br\/><br\/>Plaintiff appears to have rested his case, as did the trial judge his decision in plaintiff's\u00a0 favor, upon the provisions of article 1089 of the Civil Code read together with articles 1902, 1903, and\u00a0 1908 of that code.<br\/><blockquote>\"ART.\u00a0 1089.

Rep., 359), which would, perhaps, be involved in a decision affirming the judgment of the court below.<br\/><br\/>We agree with counsel for appellant that under the Civil Code, as under the generally accepted doctrine in the United States,\u00a0 the plaintiff in an action such as that under consideration, in\u00a0 order to establish his\u00a0 right to a recovery, must establish by competent evidence:<br\/><br\/>(1)\u00a0 Damages to the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>(2)\u00a0 Negligence by act or omission of which\u00a0 defendant personally, or some\u00a0 person for whose acts it must respond, was guilty.<br\/><br\/>(3)\u00a0 The connection of cause and effect between the negligence and the damage.<br\/><br\/>These propositions are, of course, elementary, and do not admit of\u00a0 discussion, the real difficulty arising in\u00a0 the\u00a0 application of these principles to the particular facts developed in the case under consideration.<br\/><br\/>It is clear that the accident could not have happened had not\u00a0 the fulminating caps\u00a0 been\u00a0 left\u00a0 exposed at the point where\u00a0 they were\u00a0 found, or if their owner had exercised due care in keeping\u00a0 them in an appropriate place; but it is equally\u00a0 clear that plaintiff would\u00a0 not have been\u00a0 injured had\u00a0 he not, for his own pleasure and convenience,\u00a0 entered upon defendant's premises,\u00a0 and strolled\u00a0 around\u00a0 thereon without the express permission of\u00a0 the defendant, and had he not picked up and carried away the property of the defendant which\u00a0 he found on its\u00a0 premises, and had he not thereafter deliberately cut open one of the caps and applied a match to its contents.<br\/><br\/>But counsel for plaintiff contends that because of plaintiff's youth\u00a0 and inexperience,\u00a0 his\u00a0 entry\u00a0 upon\u00a0 defendant company's premises, and the intervention of his\u00a0 action between the negligent act of defendant in leaving the caps exposed on its premises and the accident which resulted in his injury should not be held to\u00a0 have contributed in any wise\u00a0 to the\u00a0 accident,\u00a0 which should be\u00a0 deemed\u00a0 to be the direct result of defendant's negligence in leaving the caps exposed at the place where they were found by the plaintiff, and this latter the proximate cause of the accident which occasioned the injuries sustained by him.<br\/><br\/>In\u00a0 support of his contention, counsel\u00a0 for plaintiff\u00a0 relies on the\u00a0 doctrine laid down in\u00a0 many of\u00a0 the courts of last resort in the\u00a0 United\u00a0 States\u00a0 in the cases\u00a0 known as\u00a0 the \"Torpedo\" and \"Turntable\"\u00a0 cases, and the cases\u00a0 based thereon.<br\/><br\/>In\u00a0 the typical\u00a0 cases, the\u00a0 question\u00a0 involved\u00a0 has\u00a0 been whether a railroad company is liable for\u00a0 an injury received by an infant of tender years, who from mere idle curiosity, or for\u00a0 purposes of amusement, enters\u00a0 upon the railroad company's premises, at a place\u00a0 where the railroad company knew, or had\u00a0 good reason to\u00a0 suppose, children\u00a0 would be likely to come, and there found explosive signal\u00a0 torpedoes left exposed\u00a0 by the railroad company's\u00a0 employees, one of which when\u00a0 carried away\u00a0 by the visitor, exploded and injured him; or where such\u00a0 infant found upon the premises a dangerous machine, such as a turntable, left in\u00a0 such condition as to make it probable that\u00a0 children in playing with it\u00a0 would be exposed to accident or injury therefrom and where the infant did in fact suffer injury in playing with such machine.<br\/><br\/>In these, and in a great variety of similar cases,\u00a0 the great weight of authority holds the owner of the premises liable.<br\/><br\/>As\u00a0 laid down in Railroad Co. <i>vs.<\/i>\u00a0 Stout (17 Wall.

McDonald (<i>supra<\/i>) is not\u00a0 less cogent and\u00a0 convincing in this jurisdiction than in that wherein those cases originated.\u00a0\u00a0 Children here are actuated by similar childish instincts and impulses. Drawn by curiosity and impelled\u00a0 by the\u00a0 restless spirit of youth,\u00a0 boys here as well as there will\u00a0 usually be found wherever the public is permitted to congregate.\u00a0 The movement of machinery, and indeed anything\u00a0 which arouses the attention of the young and inquiring mind,\u00a0 will draw them to the neighborhood as inevitably as does the magnet draw the iron which comes within the range of its magnetic influence.\u00a0\u00a0 The owners\u00a0 of premises, therefore, whereon things attractive to children are exposed, or upon which the public are expressly or impliedly permitted to enter or\u00a0 upon which the owner knows or ought to know children are likely to roam about for pastime and in play, \"must calculate\u00a0 upon this, and take precautions accordingly.\"\u00a0\u00a0 In such cases the owner of the premises can not be heard to say that because the child has entered upon his premises without his express permission he is a trespasser to whom the owner owes no duty or obligation whatever.\u00a0\u00a0 The owner's failure to take reasonable precautions to prevent the child from entering his premises at a place where he knows or ought to know that\u00a0 children are accustomed\u00a0 to roam about\u00a0 or to which their childish instincts and impulses are\u00a0 likely to attract them is at least equivalent to an implied\u00a0 license to enter, and where the child\u00a0 does enter under such conditions the owner's failure to take reasonable precautions to guard the child against injury\u00a0 from unknown\u00a0 or\u00a0 unseen\u00a0 dangers, placed upon such premises by the owner, is clearly a breach of duty, a negligent omission,\u00a0 for which he may and should be held responsible, if the child is actually\u00a0 injured,\u00a0 without other fault on its part than that it had entered on the premises of a stranger without his\u00a0 express invitation or\u00a0 permission.\u00a0\u00a0 To hold otherwise would be to expose all the children in the community to unknown perils and unnecessary danger at the whim of the owners or occupants of\u00a0 land upon which they might naturally and reasonably be expected to enter.<br\/><br\/>This\u00a0 conclusion is founded on reason, justice, and necessity, and neither the\u00a0 contention that a man has a right to do\u00a0 what he will with his own property or that\u00a0 children should be kept under the care of their parents or guardians, so as to prevent their entering on the premises of others, is of sufficient weight to put it in doubt.\u00a0\u00a0 In this jurisdiction as\u00a0 well as in\u00a0 the United States all private property is acquired and\u00a0 held under the\u00a0 tacit condition\u00a0 that\u00a0 it shall not be\u00a0 so used as to injure the\u00a0 equal rights of others\u00a0 or greatly\u00a0 impair the public rights and interests\u00a0 of the community\u00a0 (see U.\u00a0 S.<i> vs.<\/i> Toribio,<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup>\u00a0 No. 5060,\u00a0 decided January 26,\u00a0 1910), and except as to infants of very tender years it would be absurd and unreasonable in a community organized as is that in which we live to hold that parents or guardians are guilty of negligence or imprudence in every case wherein they permit growing boys and girls to leave the parental roof unattended, even if\u00a0 in the\u00a0 event\u00a0 of\u00a0 accident to the child\u00a0 the negligence of the parent could in any event be imputed to the child so as to deprive it of a right to recover in such cases - a point which we neither discuss nor decide.<br\/><br\/>But while we hold that the entry of the plaintiff upon defendant's property without defendant's express invitation or permission would not have relieved defendant from responsibility for\u00a0 injuries incurred there by plaintiff, without other fault on his part, if such\u00a0 injury\u00a0 were attributable to the negligence of the defendant, we are of opinion that under all the\u00a0 circumstances of this case the negligence of the defendant in leaving the caps exposed on its premises was\u00a0 not the proximate cause of the injury received by the plaintiff, which\u00a0 therefore was not, properly speaking, \"attributable to the negligence of the defendant,\" and, on the other hand, we are satisfied that plaintiff's action in cutting open the detonating cap and putting a match to its contents was\u00a0 the proximate cause of the explosion and of the resultant\u00a0 injuries inflicted upon the plaintiff, and\u00a0 that the defendant, therefore, is not civilly responsible for the injuries thus incurred.<br\/><br\/>Plaintiff contends, upon the authority of the Turntable and\u00a0 Torpedo\u00a0 cases,\u00a0 that because\u00a0 of plaintiff's youth the intervention of his action between the negligent act of the defendant in leaving the caps exposed on its premises and the explosion\u00a0 which\u00a0 resulted in his\u00a0 injury\u00a0 should not be \"held to have contributed in any wise to the accident; and it is because we can not agree witli this proposition, although we accept the doctrine of the Turntable and Torpedo cases, that\u00a0 we have thought proper to discuss and to consider that doctrine at length in this decision.\u00a0 As was\u00a0 said in case of Railroad Co. <i> vs<\/i>. Stout (<i>supra<\/i>), \"While it is the general rule\u00a0 in regard to\u00a0 an adult that to entitle him to recover damages for an injury resulting from the fault or negligence of another\u00a0 he must himself\u00a0 have been free from\u00a0 fault, such is not the rule in regard to an infant of tender years. The\u00a0 care\u00a0 and caution required of a\u00a0 child is according to his maturity and capacity only, and <i>this is to be determined in each case by the circumstances of the case.<\/i>\" As we think we have shown, under the reasoning on which rests the doctrine of the Turntable and Torpedo cases, no fault which would relieve defendant of responsibility for injuries resulting from its negligence can be attributed to the plaintiff,\u00a0 a well-grown boy of 15 years of age, because of his entry upon defendant's uninclosed premises without express permission or invitation;\u00a0 but it is a wholly different question whether\u00a0 such a\u00a0 youth\u00a0 can be said to have been free from fault when\u00a0 he willfully and deliberately cut open the detonating cap, and placed a match to the contents, knowing,\u00a0 as he undoubtedly did,\u00a0 that his action would result in an explosion.\u00a0 On this point,\u00a0 which must be determined by \"the particular circumstances of this case,\" the doctrine laid\u00a0 down in the Turntable and Torpedo\u00a0 cases\u00a0 lends\u00a0 us no direct aid, although it is worthy of observation that in all of the \"Torpedo\"\u00a0 and\u00a0 analogous cases to which our attention has been directed, the record discloses that the plaintiffs, in whose favor judgments have been affirmed, were of such\u00a0 tender years that they were\u00a0 held\u00a0 not to have\u00a0 the capacity to\u00a0 understand the nature or character of the explosive instruments which fell into their hands.<br\/><br\/>In the case at\u00a0 bar, plaintiff\u00a0 at the time of the accident was\u00a0 a well-grown youth of 15,\u00a0 more mature both mentally and physically than the average boy of his age; he had been to sea as a\u00a0 cabin boy; was\u00a0 able to earn P2.50 a day as a mechanical draftsman thirty days after the injury was incurred; and the\u00a0 record discloses throughout that he was exceptionally well qualified\u00a0 to\u00a0 take care of himself.\u00a0 The evidence of\u00a0 record leaves no room if or doubt that, despite his denials on the witness\u00a0 stand, he well knew the explosive character of the cap\u00a0 with which he was amusing himself. The\u00a0 series of experiments made by him\u00a0 in his attempt\u00a0 to produce an\u00a0 explosion, as\u00a0 described by the little girl who was present, admit of no\u00a0 other explanation.\u00a0 His attempt to discharge the cap by the use of electricity, followed by his efforts to explode\u00a0 it with a stone or a hammer, and the final success of his endeavors brought about by the application of a match\u00a0 to the contents of the cap, show clearly that he knew what he was about.\u00a0\u00a0 Nor can there be any reasonable doubt that he had reason to anticipate that the explosion might be dangerous, in view of the fact that the little girl, 9 years of age, who\u00a0 was with him at the time when he put the\u00a0 match to the contents of the cap, became frightened and ran away.<br\/><br\/>True, he may not have known\u00a0 and probably did not know the precise nature of the explosion which might be expected from the ignition of the contents of the cap, and of course he\u00a0 did not anticipate the\u00a0 resultant injuries which he\u00a0 incurred; but he well\u00a0 knew that\u00a0 a more\u00a0 or\u00a0 less\u00a0 dangerous explosion might be expected from his act, and yet he willfully, recklessly,\u00a0 and knowingly produced\u00a0 the\u00a0 explosion. It would be going far to say that \"according\u00a0 to his maturity and capacity\"\u00a0 he exercised\u00a0 such \"care\u00a0 and\u00a0 caution\" as might reasonably be required of\u00a0 him, or that the defendant or anyone else should be held civilly responsible for injuries incurred by him under such circumstances.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 law fixes no arbitrary age at which a minor can be said to have the necessary capacity to understand and appreciate the nature and consequences of his\u00a0 own\u00a0 acts,\u00a0 so as to make it negligence\u00a0 on\u00a0 his\u00a0 part\u00a0 to\u00a0 fail to exercise due care and precaution\u00a0 in\u00a0 the commission\u00a0 of\u00a0 such acts; and indeed it would be impracticable and perhaps\u00a0 impossible so to do, for in the very\u00a0 nature of things the question of negligence necessarily depends on the\u00a0 ability of the minor to understand the character of his own acts and their consequences; and the age at which a minor\u00a0 can be\u00a0 said to have such ability will necessarily vary in accordance with the varying nature of the infinite variety\u00a0 of acts which may be\u00a0 done by him.\u00a0 But some\u00a0 idea of the presumed capacity of infants under the laws in force in these Islands may be gathered\u00a0 from an\u00a0 examination of the varying ages fixed by our laws at which minors are conclusively presumed to be capable of exercising certain rights\u00a0 and incurring certain responsibilities, though it can not be said that these provisions of law are of much practical assistance in cases such as that at bar, except so far as they illustrate the rule that the capacity of a minor to become responsible for his own acts varies with the varying circumstances of\u00a0 each case.\u00a0 Under the provisions of the Penal Code a minor over fifteen years of age is presumed to be capable of committing a crime and is to be held criminally responsible therefor, although the fact that he is less than eighteen years of\u00a0 age will be taken into consideration as an extenuating circumstance (Penal Code, arts. 8 and 9).\u00a0\u00a0 At 10 years.of age a child may, under certain circumstances,\u00a0 choose which parent it prefers to\u00a0 live with (Code of Civil Procedure, sec. 771).\u00a0\u00a0 At 14 it may petition for the appointment of a guardian\u00a0 (Id., sec. 551), and may consent or\u00a0 refuse to be\u00a0 adopted\u00a0 (Id., sec. 765).\u00a0\u00a0 And males of 14 and females of\u00a0 12 are capable of contracting\u00a0 a legal marriage\u00a0 (Civil Code, art. 83; G. 0., No. 68, sec. 1).<br\/><br\/>We are satisfied that the plaintiff in this case had sufficient capacity and understanding\u00a0 to be sensible of the\" danger to\u00a0 which he exposed himself when he put the\u00a0 match to the contents of the\u00a0 cap; that he was <i>sui juris<\/i> in\u00a0 the sense that his age and his\u00a0 experience\u00a0 qualified him to understand and appreciate the necessity for the\u00a0 exercise of\u00a0 that degree of caution which would have avoided the injury which resulted from his own deliberate act; and that the injury incurred by him must be held to have been the direct and immediate result of his\u00a0 own willful and\u00a0 reckless act, so that while it may be true\u00a0 that these injuries would not have been incurred but for the negligent act of the defendant in leaving the caps exposed on its premises, nevertheless\" plaintiff's own\u00a0 act was the proximate and principal cause of the accident which inflicted the injury.<br\/><br\/>The rule of the Roman law was: <i> Quod quis ex culpa sua damnum sentit, non intelligitur damnum sentire.<\/i>\u00a0\u00a0 (Digest, book 50,\u00a0 tit. 17, rule 203.)<br\/><br\/>The <i>Partidas<\/i> contain the following provisions:<br\/><blockquote>\"The just thing is that a man should suffer the damage which comes to him through his\u00a0 own fault,\u00a0 and that he can not demand reparation therefor from another.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Law 25, tit. 5, <i>Partida <\/i>3.)<br\/><br\/>\"And they even said that when a man received an injury through his own negligence he\" should blame himself for it.\" (Rule 22, tit. 34, <i>Partida<\/i> 7.).<br\/><br\/>\"According to ancient sages, when\u00a0 a man received\u00a0 an injury through his own acts the grievance should be against himself and not against another.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Law 2, tit. 7, <i>Partida<\/i> 2.)<\/blockquote>And while there does not\u00a0 appear to be anything in the Civil\u00a0 Code\u00a0 which expressly lays\u00a0 down the law\u00a0 touching contributory negligence in this jurisdiction, nevertheless, the interpretation placed upon its provisions by the supreme court of Spain, and\u00a0 by this court\u00a0 in the case of Rakes <i>vs.<\/i> Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific Co.\u00a0 (7\u00a0 Phil. Rep., 359), clearly deny\u00a0 to the plaintiff in\u00a0 the case at bar the right to recover damages from the defendant, in whole or in part, for the injuries sustained by him.<br\/><br\/>The judgment\u00a0 of the supreme court of Spain of the 7th of March, 1902\u00a0 (93 <i> Jurisprudencia\u00a0 Civil<\/i>, 391), is directly in point.\u00a0 In that case the court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"According to\u00a0 the doctrine expressed in\u00a0 article 1902 of the Civil Code, fault or negligence is a source of obligation when between such negligence and the injury there exists the relation of cause and effect: but if the injury produced should not be the result of\u00a0 acts or omissions of a\u00a0 third party, the latter\u00a0 has no\u00a0 obligation to repair the same, although such acts\u00a0 or\u00a0 omissions\u00a0 were imprudent or\u00a0 unlawful, and much less when it is shown that the immediate cause of the injury was the negligence of the injured party himself.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The same court, in its decision of June 12, 1900, said that \"the existence of\u00a0 the alleged fault or negligence is not sufficient without proof that it,\u00a0 and no other cause, gave rise to the damage.\"<br\/><br\/>See also judgment of October 21, 1903.<br\/><br\/>To\u00a0 similar effect\u00a0 Scaevola, the learned Spanish writer, writing under that title in his <i>Jurisprudencia del Codigo Civil<\/i> (1902 Anuario, p. 455), commenting on the decision of March 7, 1902,\u00a0 says that \"in accordance\u00a0 with the doctrine expressed by article 1902 of the Civil\u00a0 Code, fault or negligence gives rise to an obligation when between it and the damage\u00a0 there exists the\u00a0 relation of cause and\u00a0 effect; but if the damage caused does not arise from acts or omissions of a third person, there is no obligation to make good upon the latter, even though such acts or omissions be imprudent or illegal, and much less\u00a0 so. when it is\u00a0 shown that the immediate\u00a0 cause of the damage lias been\u00a0 the\u00a0 recklessness of the injured party himself.\"<br\/><br\/>And again\u00a0 -<br\/><blockquote>\"In accordance with the fundamental principle of proof, that the\u00a0 burden thereof is upon the plaintiff, it is apparent that it is the duty of him who shall claim damages to establish their existence.\u00a0 The decisions of\u00a0 April 9, 1896, and March 18, July\u00a0 6, and September 27, 1898,\u00a0 have especially supported the principle, the first\u00a0 setting forth in detail the necessary points of the proof, which are two:\u00a0 An\u00a0 act\u00a0 or omission on the part of the person who\u00a0 is to be charged with the liability, and the production of\u00a0 the damage by said act or omission.<br\/><br\/>\"This\u00a0 includes, by inference, the establishment of a relation of cause or effect\u00a0 between the act or\u00a0 the omission and the damage; the latter must be the direct result of one\u00a0 of the first\u00a0 two.\u00a0 As the decision of March\u00a0 22, 1881, said, it is necessary that the damages result immediately and directly from an\u00a0 act performed culpably\u00a0 and wrongfully; 'necessarily presupposing a legal ground for imputability.'\" (Decision of October 29, 1887.)<br\/><br\/>\"Negligence is not presumed, but must be proven by him who alleges it.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Scaevola, <i>Jurisprudencia del Codigo Civil<\/i>, vol. 6, pp. 551, 552.)<\/blockquote>(Cf. decisions of supreme court\u00a0 of Spain of June 12,1900, and June 23, 1900.)<br\/><br\/>Finally, we think the doctrine in this jurisdiction applicable to the case at bar was definitely settled in this court in the maturely considered case of Rakes<i> vs.<\/i> Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific Co. (<i>supra<\/i>), wherein we held that while \"There are many cases (personal injury cases) in the supreme court of Spain\u00a0 in which the defendant was exonerated,\" on the ground that \"the negligence of the plaintiff was the immediate cause of the casualty\" (decisions of\u00a0 the 15th of January, the 19th of February, and the\u00a0 7th\u00a0 of March, 1902, stated in\u00a0 Alcubilla's Index of that year); none of the cases decided by the supreme court of Spain \"define the effect to be given the negligence of a plaintiff which contributed to his injury as one of its causes, though not the principal one, and we are left to seek the theory\u00a0 of the civil law in the practice of other countries;\" and in such cases we declared the law in this jurisdiction to require the application of \"the principle of proportional damages,\" but expressly and\u00a0 definitely denied the right\u00a0 of recovery when the acts of the\u00a0 injured party were the immediate causes\u00a0 of\u00a0 the accident.<br\/><br\/>The doctrine as\u00a0 laid down in that case is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Difficulty\u00a0 seems\u00a0 to be\u00a0 apprehended\u00a0 in deciding which acts\u00a0 of the injured party\u00a0 shall be considered immediate causes of the accident.\u00a0 The test is\u00a0 simple.\u00a0\u00a0 Distinction must be made between the accident and the injury, between the event itself, without which there\u00a0 could have been no accident,\u00a0 and those acts\u00a0 of the victim\u00a0 not entering into it, independent of it, but contributing to\u00a0 his\u00a0 own\u00a0 proper hurt.\u00a0 For instance,\u00a0 the cause\u00a0 of the accident under review was\u00a0 the\u00a0 displacement of the crosspiece or the\u00a0 failure to replace it.\u00a0 This\u00a0 produced the event\u00a0 giving occasion for damages\u00a0 that is,\u00a0 the\u00a0 sinking\u00a0 of the track and\u00a0 the sliding\u00a0 of the iron\u00a0 rails.\u00a0\u00a0 To\u00a0 this\u00a0 event, the\u00a0 act\u00a0 of\u00a0 the plaintiff in walking by the side\u00a0 of the car\u00a0 did not contribute,\u00a0 although it was an\u00a0 element of the\u00a0 damage which came to himself.\u00a0 Had the crosspiece been out of place wholly or partly through his act or omission of duty, that would\u00a0 have been\u00a0 one of the determining causes\u00a0 of\u00a0 the event or accident, for which he would have been responsible. Where he contributes to the principal occurrence,\u00a0 as one rf its determining factors, he can not\u00a0 recover.\u00a0 Where, in conjunction\u00a0 with the occurrence,\u00a0 he contributes\u00a0 only\u00a0 to his own injury, he may recover the amount that the defendant responsible\u00a0 for the event should pay for such injury, less a sum deemed a suitable equivalent for his own imprudence.\"<\/blockquote>We think\u00a0 it is quite clear that under the doctrine thus stated, the immediate cause\u00a0 of the explosion, the accident which resulted\u00a0 in\u00a0 plaintiff's injury, was his\u00a0 own\u00a0 act\u00a0 in putting a match to the contents of the cap, and that haying \"contributed to\u00a0 the\u00a0 principal occurrence, as one\u00a0 of\u00a0 its determining\u00a0 factors,\u00a0 he\u00a0 can\u00a0 not recover.\"<br\/><br\/>We have not deemed\u00a0 it necessary\u00a0 to examine the effect of plaintiff's action in picking up upon defendant's premises the detonating caps, the property of defendant, and carrying them away to\u00a0 the home of his friend, as interrupting the relation of cause and effect between the negligent act or omission\u00a0 of the defendant in\u00a0 leaving the caps\u00a0 exposed on its premises and the\u00a0 injuries inflicted upon the plaintiff\u00a0 by the explosion of one of these caps. Under the doctrine of the Torpedo cases, such\u00a0 action on the part of an infant of very tender years would have no effect in relieving defendant\u00a0 of responsibility, but whether in view of the well-known\u00a0 fact admitted in\u00a0 defendant's brief that \"boys are\u00a0 snappers-up\u00a0 of\u00a0 unconsidered trifles,\" a\u00a0 youth of the age\u00a0 and maturity of\u00a0 plaintiff should be deemed without fault in picking up\u00a0 the\u00a0 caps\u00a0 in question under all the circumstances of this case, we neither discuss nor decide.<br\/><br\/>Twenty days after the date of this decision let judgment be entered reversing the judgment\u00a0 of the court\u00a0 below, without costs to either party\u00a0 in this instance, and ten days thereafter let the record be returned to the court wherein it\u00a0 originated, where\u00a0 judgment will\u00a0 be entered in favor of the\u00a0 defendant for the\u00a0 costs in first instance and the complaint dismissed without\u00a0 day.\u00a0 So\u00a0 ordered.<br\/><br\/><i> Arellano, C.

Although the minimum\u00a0 penalty imposed\u00a0 upon a seller of opium is\u00a0 slightly heavier than the minimum penalty imposed upon a smoker of opium, nevertheless, while a seller of opium may not\u00a0 be fined more than P2,000 or imprisoned for more than\u00a0 one year,\u00a0 or\u00a0 both\u00a0 such\u00a0 fine and imprisonment, a smoker of opium may be punished by imprisonment for five years or fined P10,000,\u00a0 or\u00a0 may suffer both such\u00a0 penalties. Moreover,\u00a0 no\u00a0 matter how many times\u00a0 one\u00a0 may commit the crime of selling opium, he can not be deported, while a smoker of opium\u00a0 may be deported on the commission of a second\u00a0 offense.<br\/><br\/>It thus appears clearly\u00a0 that the\u00a0 crime of smoking opium may be punished far more severely than the crime of selling opium.\u00a0\u00a0 The Legislature must, therefore, have been of the opinion that the crime of\u00a0 smoking opium is\u00a0 a far greater evil than\u00a0 that of selling opium.\u00a0 Whether or not the Legislature was right ought not, in my judgment,\u00a0 to be\u00a0 the subject of discussion here\u00a0 under the facts presented.\u00a0 The question\u00a0 whether or not a seller of opium is a person\u00a0 who produces\u00a0 more evil\u00a0 in a community than\u00a0 one who smokes opium is an academic question, the discussion of which leads to\u00a0 no\u00a0 results\u00a0 in this case, especially in view of the plain mandate\u00a0 of the law.\u00a0 The\u00a0 fact remains\u00a0 that\u00a0 the smoker, under the law, may be punished far more severely than the\u00a0 seller.<br\/><br\/>I base\u00a0 my concurrence in the increased penalty imposed by the court upon the ground that the\u00a0 accused were public employees in whom was imposed confidence and upon whom were placed responsibilities\u00a0 of a public ,nature and that they\u00a0 willfully violated\u00a0 such confidence and\u00a0 evaded\u00a0 such responsibilities.<\/div>",

Yap Chuangco, Yap Chutco, Carlos Palanca Tanguinlay, Serafin Palanca Yap\u00a0 Poco and Lim Biampung, known as\u00a0 Lim Pongco, shall be the sureties of Don Engracio Palanca in favor of Mr. Luis S. Vizmanos Ong-Quico, binding themselves jointly as such to reimburse or to pay to the said Mr. Vizmanos, his\u00a0 heirs and successors in interest, whatever sums the said Vizmanos may have to pay or shall have paid by reason of the judicial bond herein mentioned, subscribed by him in favor of Mr. Palanca, up to the amount of forty thousand pesos, Philippine currency, in the proportion of not exceeding\u00a0 P20,000\u00a0 by Yap Chuangco and P5,000 by each\u00a0 one of\u00a0 the other four herein above mentioned.\"<\/blockquote>On\u00a0 March 9, 1908, the\u00a0 court which tried\u00a0 the case concerning\u00a0 the estate ordered Luis Saenz de Vizmanos Ong-Quico, as\u00a0 surety\u00a0 in solidum of the ex-administrator\u00a0 Engracio Palanca, to pay to the estate the sum of P41,690.15, Philippine\u00a0 currency, also the interest on the said sum at the rate of 8. per cent per annum,\u00a0 counting from December 27,\u00a0 1905, with other sums set out in the sentence.\u00a0\u00a0 This judgment became final.<br\/><br\/>On\u00a0 March 31,\u00a0 1908, Vizmanos Ong-Quico paid to the administrator of the estate eight thousand pesos (P8,000), Philippine currency, by the conveyance of property belonging to him, he still owing P40,975.92,\u00a0 with interest on the said amount at 8 per cent\u00a0 per annum\u00a0 from the 9th day of March, 1908, the date of the judgment.<br\/><br\/>On\u00a0 April\u00a0 2, 1908, he instituted\u00a0 suit against the five sureties above named\u00a0 who, with Engracio Palanca, executed the bond before mentioned in his\u00a0 favor, praying the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila to sentence them to pay him:\u00a0 Yap Chuangco, \u00a5=20,000, and the other four sureties, Yap\u00a0 Chutco, Carlos Palanca Tanguinlay, Serafin\u00a0 Palanca\u00a0 Yap Poco,\u00a0 and Lim Pongco,\u00a0 each\u00a0 P5,000, that is, these four\u00a0 together P20,000 more,\u00a0 and jointly the costs\u00a0 of the action.<br\/><br\/>The court, in its judgment, acquitted Yap Chuangco from the claim of the P20,000, assessing against the plaintiff the part of the costs pertaining to this defendant, and\u00a0 ordered each\u00a0 one of\u00a0 the\u00a0 four remaining defendants, Yap\u00a0 Chutco, Carlos Palanca Tanguinlay, Serafin Palanca Yap Poco, and Lim Biang Pon (alias Lim Pongco), to pay to the plaintiff, Luis Saenz de Vizmanos, the sum of P2,000, with legal interest at 6\u00a0 per cent per annum on the said respective sums from\u00a0 March\u00a0 31, 1908, the date on which the plaintiff paid to the present\u00a0 administrator of the estate the said sum of P8,000, until its complete payment.\u00a0 The said four\u00a0 defendants had also to pay jointly, that is, in equal shares, the costs\u00a0 pertaining to them.<br\/><br\/>Both parties appealed from this sentence, each one forwarding to this court his respective bill of exceptions, together with all the evidence taken at the trial, besides the stenographic notes\u00a0 which were also forwarded by special order of the trial court.<br\/><br\/>The appeal having been heard before this court, it appears that:<br\/><br\/>The defendants appealed on account of their having been ordered to pay, each of them, T2,000, instead of only P1,000, which\u00a0 according to the terms of the contract, each one of them\u00a0 was bound to pay to the plaintiff.\u00a0 (Only error alleged.)<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff appealed because the court refused to render judgment against the\u00a0 defendants for the maximum sum for which\u00a0 each one had bound himself in the contract, which he calls a counterbond or subbond, that is, each one of the four to pay P5,000.\u00a0\u00a0 (Only error alleged.)<br\/><br\/>The share of P20,000 which the'plaintiff claimed from Yap Chuangco is not included in the former's appeal, from the payment of which amount the latter\u00a0 is relieved in the judgment,\u00a0 for he expressly states in his brief that he conforms to this part of the judgment and that \"his appeal solely relates to the other defendants.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Brief, 4.)<br\/><br\/>With respect to the other four defendants, the plaintiff and appellant claims that, notwithstanding his having paid only\u00a0 P8,000 of his\u00a0 bond, the defendants ought\u00a0 to\u00a0 reimburse him\u00a0 at the rate of P5,000 each, that is, all together to the\u00a0 amount\u00a0 of\u00a0 P20,000.\u00a0 As\u00a0 above stated, the\u00a0 lower court only\u00a0 sentenced\u00a0 them to reimburse their proportional share of the P8,000\u00a0 paid, to wit, P2,000 each, P8,000 all together.\u00a0\u00a0 Thus they\u00a0 would be paying even the proportional share corresponding\u00a0 to Yap Chuangco,\u00a0 which is P4,000, whereas the plaintiff\u00a0 appellant agrees that the share of the bond\u00a0 concerning Yap Chuangco should be void by reason of its having been executed by an attorney in fact of the latter who\u00a0 did not possess sufficient power for this purpose.<br\/><br\/>Hence the only error alleged by the defendants in their brief, inasmuch as,\u00a0 having deducted the P4,000 which Yap Chuangco\u00a0 would have to pay,\u00a0 the other four defendants must\u00a0 pay only P4,000, that is, Pl,000 each.<br\/><blockquote>\"We can not but agree with this claim of the attorneys for the defendants - say those of the plaintiff\u00a0 - if this court, disregarding the reasons contained in\u00a0 our brief, should declare\u00a0 that the plaintiff is only entitled to\u00a0 recover\u00a0 the money that he\u00a0 really and actually has expended, to wit, P8,000, then it appears unquestionable that the defendants and appellants are\u00a0 only compelled to pay P1,000 each, as their attorneys state in their brief.\"\u00a0 (Brief, 2.)<br\/><\/blockquote>With regard to the sole error alleged\u00a0 by the\u00a0 attorneys for the\u00a0 plaintiff, it\u00a0 must first be considered that the bond which the four defendants in turn executed in favor of the plaintiff bondsman is not a\u00a0 subbond; it is not of the same nature as that given by the latter in favor of Engracio Palanca in the probate proceedings in connection with the will of Margarita Jose.\u00a0 Although one bond is subordinate to another, not for this reason are they\u00a0 of the same nature. That of Vizmanos for Engracio Palanca\u00a0 in favor of the estate is judicial and was\u00a0 approved by the probate judge; that of the defendants for Engracio Palanca in favor of Vizmanos\u00a0 was\u00a0 extra judicial\u00a0 and the probate judge\u00a0 had nothing to do with it.\u00a0 The new administrator of the estate had a right of action, and he exercised it against Vizmanos to enforce the payment of the bond given by the latter, but he has none nor can he exercise any whatsoever against the four who gave bond for Engracio Palanca\u00a0 in favor of Vizmanos.\u00a0 The only relation that exists between the one bond and the other is merely that of antecedent and\u00a0 consequent, in so far as that of Vizmanos in\u00a0 favor of the estate was the cause\u00a0 of debt of that of the\u00a0 defendants in favor of Vizmanos.\u00a0 The\u00a0 first\u00a0 one was\u00a0 strictly judicial,\u00a0 the second merely contractual between the parties,<br\/><br\/>When a\u00a0 surety pays for the party under bond, he has a right of action against such party for the recovery of the amount paid\u00a0 by him.<br\/><blockquote>\"A surety who pays for a debtor shall be indemnified by the latter.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Art.\u00a0 1838, Civil Code.)<br\/><\/blockquote>The surety Vizmanos who fcaid for the debtor\u00a0 Palanca must be indemnified by Palanca.\u00a0 And as it was\u00a0 evident, when Vizmanos\u00a0 became surety for Palanca, that the latter could not pay him, Palanca obligated himself by the four defendants, or,\u00a0 better said, the four defendants assumed the obligation that\u00a0 rested upon Palanca to indemnify Vizmanos for what\u00a0 the latter might pay for Palanca.\u00a0 This is in fact the\u00a0 obligation that is now exercised.\u00a0 The action of the surety\u00a0 against the party under bond or the debtor to require the obligation of indemnity, has no other name nor other nature\u00a0 in\u00a0 law than that of a subrogation;\u00a0 it is an unquestionable doctrine.\u00a0 The\u00a0 action of subrogation is regulated\u00a0 in article\u00a0 1839 of the Civil Code;<br\/><blockquote>\"By virtue of such payment the surety is subrogated in all the rights which the creditor had against the debtor.\"<br\/><br\/>\"But be\u00a0 it well understood - says\u00a0 a commentator - that this subrogation can not be interpreted in such absolute terms as to include more than the\u00a0 surety has\u00a0 paid, for, though it is true that he puts himself in the place of the creditor and should have the same rights as the latter in consequence of the subrogation, it is no less certain\u00a0 that there\u00a0 would be an unjust enrichment to the prejudice\u00a0 of the debtor,\u00a0 if the surety who pays for him were\u00a0 permitted to\u00a0 claim more than\u00a0 what he paid.\u00a0 Moreover, the benefit of subrogation is the means\u00a0 of utilizing the right of reimbursement,\u00a0 and he could not collect as such the excess\u00a0 from the rights and actions of the creditor over and above the advance made by him.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (12 Manresa, Civil Code, 304.)<\/blockquote>The contract law says no more than this:<br\/><blockquote>\"Being that the case may occur - say those obligated - that the said Vizmanos may have to pay the said bond or a part thereof\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 for the purpose of guaranteeing the reimbursement of the sum or sums which by reason of the bond he may have to pay, the executors have agreed and stipulated that\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 they shall be the sureties of Don Engracio Palanca in favor of Sr. Luis S. Vizmanos, binding themselves as such\u00a0 conjointly to\u00a0 <i>reimburse <\/i>or to\u00a0 pay *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 whatever amounts\u00a0 the latter might have to\u00a0 pay or shall have paid by reason of the judicial bond aforementioned.\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\"<\/blockquote>Being as it is an action of\u00a0 subrogation, it is. not exercisable except\u00a0 in the case of payment.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 surety\u00a0 is\u00a0 subrogated by\u00a0 the\u00a0 payment, says the law, in\u00a0 all the rights that the creditor had against the\u00a0 debtor.\u00a0\u00a0 Being as\u00a0 it is an action of indemnity it is not conceived how, rationally, the damage\u00a0 not yet caused can be anticipated. When the purse of the surety has suffered no detriment, to sue the debtor\u00a0 in\u00a0 order that he provide funds for the surety in expectancy of the action of the creditor, is\u00a0 not to ask an indemnity, but to demand a\u00a0 guaranty to recover the loss when it may occur, and this\u00a0 guaranty is that already obtained by the surety Vizmanos from Engracio Palanca on the latter's placing beforehand four parties in his stead in order that they may at the proper time insure him of the restitution, the reimbursement of what he shall have paid. To ask\u00a0 an indemnity of twenty, when the loss to\u00a0 be indemnified is but eight, can in no\u00a0 wise\u00a0 be authorized either by law or by reason.<br\/><br\/>The Civil Code specifies five cases as exceptions wherein the surety, even before paying,\u00a0 may\u00a0 proceed against\u00a0 the principal debtor, but \"in all these\u00a0 cases the action\u00a0 of the surety tends to obtain his release\u00a0 from the security or\u00a0 a guaranty to <i>defend<\/i> him against any proceedings of the creditor\u00a0 and from the danger\u00a0 of insolvency\u00a0 of the debtor.\" (Art. 1843, Civil Code.)\u00a0\u00a0 The security or bond given by the four defendants in favor of the plaintiff Vizmanos had no other purpose than,\u00a0 in case\u00a0 he should\u00a0 make payment to the estate of Margarita Jose,\u00a0 to defend himself against the proceedings of the administrator of the estate and from the danger of insolvency of the debtor Palanca.<br\/><br\/>Although, in principle, by virtue\u00a0 of the contract in question, the four defendants are obligated to the plaintiff in the sum of P20,000, that is,\u00a0 at\u00a0 the rate of P5,000 each, the action ad\u00a0 cautelam is, precisely, covered by\u00a0 such\u00a0 a contract, and the action of subrogation, the only\u00a0 one exercisable, is only available in\u00a0 the quality of a restitution or reimbursement of the payment\u00a0 effected.\u00a0 In the present case\u00a0 the plaintiff, by virtue of the contract ad cautelam, is entitled to an action against\u00a0 the four\u00a0 defendants for recovery from each of them up to\u00a0 the maximum amount of P5,000, but he can not by such\u00a0 action,\u00a0 as\u00a0 surety for the principal debtor,\u00a0 collect more\u00a0 than\u00a0 the sum which he himself was actually compelled to pay.<br\/><br\/>In virtue of the foregoing,\u00a0 the judgment appealed from is reversed in so far as it sentences each one of the four defendants, Yap\u00a0 Chutco, Carlos\u00a0 Palanca Tanguinlay, Serafin Palanca Yap Poco, and\u00a0 Lim Biang Pong (<i>alias <\/i> Lim Pongco), to pay to the plaintiff, Luis Saenz de Vizmanos, the sum of P2,000.\u00a0 The amount to be paid is hereby fixed at P1,000, to the payment of which, in favor of the aforesaid plaintiff,\u00a0 each of the four defendants mentioned were sentenced, \"with legal interest at the rate of 6 per cent per annum on the said respective\u00a0 sums, from March 31,\u00a0 1908, the date on\u00a0 which\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiff paid to the present administrator of the said estate the said sum of P8,000, until its complete payment.\u00a0\u00a0 The said four defendants shall pay the costs in equal\u00a0 shares.\"\u00a0\u00a0 The costs of this instance shall be assessed against the plaintiff and appellant Vizmanos.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa, Johnson,<\/i> and <i>Moreland,\u00a0 JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><\/div>",

The accused has been compelled to be a witness against himself j in violation of article 5 of the law of Congress of July 1, 1902. (32 Stat. at L., 692, chap. 1369.)<\/p><p>\"2. The fact that the accused did not offer himself as a witness in his own favor has been used to his prejudice, in violation of his right to remain silent until his guilt be established by the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.<\/p><p>\"3. The evidence does not show the guilt of accused of the crime imputed to him beyond a reasonable doubt.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The argument to support the first assignment of error is not very tangible. It is based upon an affidavit of defendant that he was subpoenaed as a witness, and obeyed by going to the fiscaFs, where he answered questions put to him without knowing that he had a right to refuse, or being notified that he had such right, and not knowing that \"the object of securing his statement was in order to search for proof against him.\" The affidavit also states that he was not represented by counsel and did not know that he had a right to consult a lawyer. Motion was made, presumably based on the affidavit, for an order to the fiscal to return to the defendant the statement, together with all copies of the same, and that the fiscal be prohibited from using the statement in any manner whatever. Nothing seems to have been done with that motion, and subsequently it was repeated and denied on the ground \"that it was not a proper time to make such motion, as the court could not then decide on the admissibility of proofs which had not yet been offered in the cause.\" An exception was entered.<\/p><p>It is not contended that the statement was afterwards used in any way, but the action of the court is urged nevertheless as an error \"so grave and so material,\" to use counsel's words, \"as to call for a new trial.\"<\/p><p>The argument to support it is based on suppositions of what might have been done, and the potency of the statement in the hands of the prosecuting officer. \"It left the defendant open, it is said, to the fire of a masked battery.\" But the law has no measure to apply to such a situation. Defendant was certainly not disabled from telling the truth in other statements if he wished to make them, and to be able not to tell the truth can hardly be urged as a legal and constitutional right. The assignment of error, therefore, is not well taken.<\/p><p>The second assignment of error is that the fact that the defendant did. not offer himself as a witness was used against him. To support this contention, certain remarks of the judge of the trial court in delivering sentence upon the defendant are quoted. The court said:<\/p><blockquote>\u00a0 <p>\"The prosecution has presented an 'abundance of proof which, in case the court should give it full credence, would establish the guilt of the accused beyond all reasonable doubt. On the other hand, the defense has presented very little direct pro6f; the accused did not use his right to testify in his own favor, and no eye witness has testified favorably to him. The defense has practically limited itself to insisting on (1) Alleged contradictions between the various witnesses of the prosecution relating to the details of identical facts or happenings related by them. (2) Mistakes which they claim to be essential, in the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution with respect to distances and relative positions of persons and objects connected with the case. (3) The expert testimony of two physicians that the deceased could not have died as the result of a wound received in the manner stated by the witness for the prosecution.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>An analysis of this language is made by counsel, and its relation to the general character of the evidence is discussed, and the conclusion deduced that the trial court urged three arguments to sustain its judgment: \"First, paucity of proof in behalf of the defendant. Second, his failure to testify in his own favor. Third, his failure to get any eyewitness to the shooting, to rebut evidence of the Filipinos who claim to have been eyewitnesses.\" And to this summary, which, it is urged, demonstrates that the trial court considered in determining the guilt of defendant, that he failed to take the stand in his own behalf, there is added the comment of the Supreme Court of the Islands in its review of the case, or rather, in denying a motion for a new trial, after its decision of the case. Upon the first consideration of the case in the supreme court, no assignment of error based on the point was made. It was raised for the first time in what is styled, \"Exception to the Judgment, and Motion for a New Trial,\" in which he excepted to the judgment rendered by the supreme court, and prayed that it be set asida and a new trial granted him. The reasons given were as follows:<br\/><\/p><blockquote><p>\"1. The defendant has \"been compelled to testify against himself, in violation of article 5 of the law of Congress of July 1, 1902, in the following manner:<\/p><p>\"The accused, taking advantage of the right conceded him in the third paragraph of article 15 of the General Orders No. 58, did not testify in the Court of First Instance, and said court, in its judgment, considered this circumstance as prejudicial to the defendant; and the Attorney-General adduced the same circumstance in his brief in this court in the following words:<\/p><p>\" 'No direct proof was presented by the defense to contradict the facts stated by the witnesses for the prosecution; nor did the defendant himself testify in his own favor to deny the grave crime with which he is charged.'<\/p><p>\"And to overcome, as far as possible, the effect of this illegal procedure so prejudicial to the accused, his counsel in this court, speaking in his name, felt himself obliged to state to the court that the defendant did not go on the witness stand because he did not remember anything about the occurrence; which circumstance was considered by the court as a fact prejudicial to the defendant and appellant in the following words:<\/p><p>\" 'The defendant,\" a lieutenant of constabulary, in command at the Parian barracks at Cebu, being intoxicated, borrowed a carromata, which was without lights, from a friend, and was found wandering about the streets therein by a municipal policeman named Almonte, who, at his request, drove him to the barracks. As to subsequent occurrences, we have not the benefit of his recollection, and must rely on the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution and the circumstances of the case.' \"<br\/>\u00a0 <\/p><\/blockquote><p>To which it was replied:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"The court having heard the petition of Attorney Kincaid, praying for a new trial of case No. 3176, the United States <em>vs.<\/em> Pendleton, in which a decision was rendered by this court on the 9th of. the present month of February, 1907, said that although the fact that the defendant declined or failed to testify as a witness was taken into consideration by the court of first instance; this court, in deciding the cause, did not take said fact into consideration, but rendered the decision in accordance with the proofs presented at the trial, and therefore the new trial solicited is denied.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Defendant puts aside the disclaimer of the supreme court as unimportant in an argument which is certainly difficult to represent if not to follow. He appealed to the supreme court to review the judgment of the lower court. He made a motion for a new trial in the supreme court, and that being denied, he now urges, not error committed in the supreme court, but error committed in the trial court This is worked out and attempted to be justified by an argument that, it may be, we do not understand. It is said that the supreme court misapprehended the \"function conferred upon it by Congress and the Philippine Commission in relation to reviewing the decisions of courts of first instance.\" That it seemed to be of opinion that it had \"the same authority in this regard as was possessed by its Spanish predecessor, the <em>Audiencia<\/em>,\" and \"passed on the decision of the court below about as a reviewing court would pass on an equity proceeding upon written testimony submitted by affidavits and interrogatory depositions.\" And by doing so, counsel further urge that the supreme court did not have before it what they describe as \" the supremely human element\u2014the appearance of the witnesses and their manner on the stand, etc.,\" and, not having such element, could not judge of the effect of the evidence independently of the silence of the defendant, and could not determine, therefore, how much the error of the trial court, in considering such silence, controlled its judgment. The answer is that the supreme court had the power to review the case and consider all that was necessary to the exercise of such power. That power was invoked by defendant, and he secured from its exercise a reduction of three years in his sentence. And Trono <em>vs.<\/em> United States, 199 U. S., 521; 50 L. ed., 292; 26 Sup. Ct. Rep., 121, 4 A &amp; E. Ann. Cas., 773, may be cited as an answer to the contention. In that case the power of review which the supreme court possessed over the judgment of the trial court was exerted to the extent of reversing a judgment and sentence for assault, and rendering a judgment for homicide. Trono <em>vs.<\/em> United States needs very little comment.

Counsel\u00a0 for the opponent,\u00a0 Florencio Mejia, excepted to this judgment and prayed that it be quashed and the case reopened on the ground that the evidence adduced was insufficient, which motion was overruled and\u00a0 exception was taken\u00a0 by the opponent, who duly filed the\u00a0 proper\u00a0 bill of exceptions, which was\u00a0 approved,\u00a0 certified, and forwarded to this court.<br\/><br\/>In order that an application for the registration of a rural property in the registry of property may prosper, it is indispensable that the person\u00a0 who\u00a0 presents the\u00a0 same exercise absolute\u00a0 control\u00a0 over the\u00a0 land, that he be the owner,\u00a0 proprietor, and possessor of the realty and establish\u00a0 in a clear and unmistakable manner the situation and boundaries of the same in such wise that the identity of the property proposed for registration be perfectly proved.<br\/><br\/>The applicant for the registration of real\u00a0 property is in the same condition as is\u00a0 a\u00a0 person\u00a0 who prosecutes,\u00a0 before the courts, an action for the recovery of possession wherein it\u00a0 is necessary,\u00a0 to secure a\u00a0 favorable judgment,\u00a0 that\u00a0 the claimant prove, in an unquestionable manner,\u00a0 his ownership and the\u00a0 identity of\u00a0 the property claimed. The applicant, Manuel Oligan, was unsuccessful in fulfilling\u00a0 these requirements,\u00a0 notwithstanding\u00a0 the testimony\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 several witnesses whom he presented, as it appears from the proceedings had in this case.<br\/><br\/>A due and careful examination of the testimony of the applicant and\u00a0 his witnesses discloses\u00a0 great\u00a0 confusion and notable and substantial contradictions therein with\u00a0 regard to the approximate date when Oligan\u00a0 began to occupy and to break up\u00a0 the land in question, as\u00a0 well as with respect to the date when\u00a0 he\u00a0 commenced to sow the\u00a0 same.\u00a0 The applicant even contradicted\u00a0 himself in his own\u00a0 testimony which, besides, does not accord with that given by his witnesses; furthermore the latter contradicted one another in the matter of certain details\u00a0 which,\u00a0 notwithstanding\u00a0 the order of February 29, 1908, could not be cleared up.<br\/><br\/>The applicant's plan, Exhibit\u00a0 A,\u00a0 must have been made about the middle\u00a0 of the year\u00a0 1906, and in\u00a0 the\u00a0 month\u00a0 of June his technical description (p. 3 of the record) appears to have been\u00a0 signed,\u00a0 and if it is not\u00a0 deficient,\u00a0 as\u00a0 at first sight it appears to be, it is to be believed that the land, the registration of which is solicited, is in fact comprised within the land of greater area belonging to the opponent, inasmuch as the said plan does not show who are the adjacent owners of the lands\u00a0 to the north, south, and\u00a0 west,\u00a0 and\u00a0 gives but two boundaries toward the east\u00a0 and the Abiluleng\u00a0 River; and the applicant, answering in a confused, when not contradictory, manner the questions addressed to\u00a0 him, was unable to establish the true boundaries of the land claimed by him, so that, by depending on\u00a0 his testimony, it would be impossible to determine the true situation of\u00a0 the said property.\u00a0 His own witness, Paulino Lata (p. 14 of the record), testified that the\u00a0 land of Florencio Mejia in the barrio of San Vicente comprised the land in question, and the applicant himself, Manuel Oligan, stated that the\u00a0 original owner of his land was Jose Perez, from whom it was purchased by a man named Bosch, and afterwards by one Arevalo, and that, with respect\u00a0 to the boundaries of his\u00a0 land, the creek, the northern boundary of the same, was called Abiluleng Subul, while in his\u00a0 own\u00a0 plan\u00a0 it\u00a0 is only stated that toward the north there is a creek, and that its southern boundary was the Abiluleng River, adding in his said testimony that the river just mentioned changed\u00a0 its course once upon a. time, though it afterwards returned to its\u00a0 old channel.\u00a0 Since the Abiluleng River forms the southern and eastern boundary lines of\u00a0 the\u00a0 property, and crosses the\u00a0 land\u00a0 of the opponent Mejia, it is not\u00a0 possible\u00a0 for\u00a0 the applicant's land to have for its northern, western, and\u00a0 southern boundaries the same river, as the applicant and one of his witnesses, Jacinto Reyes, in an undecided and confused manner stated that it had, for, according to the plan of the\u00a0 said land, it is bounded on the north by a\u00a0 creek, and on the south and east by the Abiluleng River, notwithstanding the different names by which, the applicant affirms, this river is known. The applicant Oligan did\u00a0 not\u00a0 exhibit a title nor any document whatever to prove even so much as his possession, and the record does not show any data by means of which it might\u00a0 be\u00a0 shown\u00a0 that the\u00a0 land\u00a0 in\u00a0 question\u00a0 was public unappropriated land,\u00a0 susceptible of occupation, when the applicant took possession\u00a0 of it on a date which he\u00a0 could not fix with certainty.<br\/><br\/>On the contrary, the record shows it to have been fully proved that, at the time of the death of Carlos Bosch, he was in possession of a large tract of land situated in Macayug, barrio of San Vicente, comprising the property sought to be registered by the applicant, Oligan. After Bosch died, his widow, Leona Lamsen, instituted possessory information proceedings, in April, 1895, before\u00a0 the justice of the'peace court of the pueblo of San Jacinto, in connection with the said 77 hectares of\u00a0 land the\u00a0 situation and boundaries of which\u00a0 appear in the information\u00a0 mentioned\u00a0 (Exhibit 2, found\u00a0 on\u00a0 p. 33 of the trial record), and which parcel is shown to have been recorded in the registry of property of Pangasinan on the 1st of\u00a0 April,\u00a0 1901,\u00a0 page 35.\u00a0 This information bears witness that his predecessors, the proprietors of the land therein referred to, had been in possession of the same for more than thirty years.\u00a0\u00a0 So that the original owners of the land of which the property in litigation forms a part were in legitimate possession of it very many years prior to 1895, and this possession is proven by a\u00a0 public document.<br\/><br\/>On June 24, 1901,\u00a0 according to Exhibit No. 3, which is attached to page 36\u00a0 of the record, the\u00a0 whole of the said tract of land\u00a0 was sold to Juan Arevalo by the widow and heirs of the deceased Carlos Bosch, and the deed of sale was entered on the registry of property on July 30, 1901.<br\/><br\/>On the 10th of July oi the same year, 1901, Juan Arevalo, in turn, sold the same land, having the same area and boundaries, to Florencio Mejia, according to the\u00a0 deed found\u00a0 on page 29 of the trial record and also recorded in the registry of property on the 30th of the same month and year.<br\/><br\/>The opponent, Florencio Mejia, averred in an affidavit that he continued in the possession of the land enjoyed by his ancestors, the last of whom was Juan Arevalo; that Mariano Biascan, who\u00a0 corroborated the statement, was the affiant's manager in charge of the said land;\u00a0 and that he paid the taxes pertaining to the property, as evidenced by the receipts exhibited on pages 52 and 53 of the trial record.<br\/><br\/>From\u00a0 the\u00a0 testimony\u00a0 of the witnesses\u00a0 of the opponent Mejia it likewise appears that, on demand being made upon the applicant Oligan by Mariano Biascan, the manager for the owner, the first time, in 1904, for the payment of the rental of the land occupied by the said opponent, the latter replied that three years had not yet\u00a0 elapsed since he had possessed the\u00a0 property,\u00a0 and that,\u00a0 when a similar demand was\u00a0 made on\u00a0 him the second time, he refused to pay the rental, saying that the land was his because he had cleared it, which was not true, because those\u00a0 who cleared the land of wood and\u00a0 brush were Domingo Agsaoay, Policarpo Milanes, and another man, which\u00a0 parties stated that, after they had been working on the land for three years and when they had\u00a0 it cleared the\u00a0 applicant Oligan took possession of it, on the fourth year of the insurrection\u00a0 that\u00a0 is,\u00a0 in 1901 or 1902 - a detail which was confirmed by a statement made by Oligan himself in his testimony, to the effect that he began to sow the land in 1903; wherefore proof is absolutely lacking to show that the applicant was in possession of unappropriated public\u00a0 land for more than ten years, the\u00a0 period\u00a0 required\u00a0 to\u00a0 enable him\u00a0 to\u00a0 claim the benefits allowed by section 54 of the Public Land Act, No. 926.<br\/><br\/>The trial record\u00a0 shows that the\u00a0 applicant, during\u00a0 the fury of the insurrection and when the opponent could\u00a0 not personally appear on his land nor attend to it, took advantage of those circumstances and possessed himself of\u00a0 the portion of the property that he detains and seeks to register without right whatever - a procedure which does not affect the true and legitimate possession of the entire tract of land, pertaining to the opponent, inasmuch as article 444 of\u00a0 the Civil Code prescribes:<br\/><blockquote>\"Acts which are merely tolerated and those clandestinely executed,\u00a0 without\u00a0 knowledge of the possessor of the thing, or by force, do not affect the possession.\"<\/blockquote>It is to be noted that the opponent,\u00a0 Florencio Mejia, is now in possession\u00a0 of the whole tract of 77 hectares of land, which he\u00a0 had legitimately acquired by just title, as proven by public documents duly registered which he exhibited in proof of his contention, and neither reason nor legal ground exists wherefore he should be deprived of a certain portion, more than 7 hectares, which forms a part of the said\u00a0 77 hectares, for the benefit of the applicant who has proved no right therein whatever, nor even a possession\u00a0 such\u00a0 as ought to be protected by the law and the courts.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons,\u00a0 it is our opinion\u00a0 that\u00a0 the judgment appealed from should be reversed and\u00a0 the case dismissed, and we so\u00a0 hold, inasmuch as the portion of land the entry of which on the registry of property\u00a0 is sought belongs\u00a0 to the opponent.\u00a0 No special finding is made with respect to the costs in either instance.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Johnson, Moreland,<\/i> and <i>Trent, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><\/div>",

He asked at the same time for a new trial on the grounds that\u00a0 the findings\u00a0 of fact\u00a0 of the court were openly\u00a0 and manifestly contrary to the weight of the evidence, and\u00a0 that the latter did not justify the said decision which, he alleged, was\u00a0 contrary to law.\u00a0 This motion was denied and exception\u00a0 was taken thereto by the Attorney-General,\u00a0 who\u00a0 duly presented the required bill of exceptions which was certified and forwarded to this court.<br\/><br\/>The question submitted to the\u00a0 decision of this court, through the appeal raised by the Attorney-General in representation\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 Director of\u00a0 Lands, is\u00a0 whether\u00a0 the lot occupied by the court-house of the municipality of Catbalogan, of the Island and Province of Samar, belongs to the said\u00a0 municipality\u00a0 or is state land under the control of the Insular Government.<br\/><br\/>In\u00a0 order to\u00a0 obtain a better understanding of the\u00a0 final conclusion to be established in this decision,\u00a0 it is\u00a0 meet to state: That for the purpose of the establishment\u00a0 of\u00a0 new pueblos in this\u00a0 Archipelago, at the beginning of its occupation\u00a0 by the Spaniards, an endeavor was always made to find, in favorable places, a nucleus of inhabitants and, later, near\u00a0 the pueblos already\u00a0 established, barrios, which ordinarily served as a basis for\u00a0 the\u00a0 formation\u00a0 of other\u00a0 new pueblos that\u00a0 became as populated as the centers\u00a0 on which they were dependent.<br\/><br\/>The executive\u00a0 authorities\u00a0 and\u00a0 other officials who\u00a0 then represented the Spanish Government in these Islands were obliged to adjust\u00a0 their procedure,\u00a0 in the\u00a0 fulfillment of their duties with\u00a0 regard\u00a0 to\u00a0 the\u00a0 establishment and laying out of new towns, to the Laws of the Indies, which determined the course that they were to pursue for such purposes, as may be seen by the following:<br\/><br\/>Law 6, title 5, book 4, of the Recompilation of the Laws of the Indies, provides, among other things:<br\/><blockquote>\"That within the boundaries which may be assigned to it, there must be at least thirty residents,\u00a0 and each one of them must have a house,\" etc.<br\/><br\/>Law 7 of the same title and book contains this provision;<br\/><br\/>\"Whoever wishes to undertake to establish a new town in the manner provided for, of not more\u00a0 than thirty nor less than\u00a0 ten residents,\u00a0 shall be granted the time and territory\u00a0 necessary for the\u00a0 purpose and under the same conditions.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It may be affirmed that years afterwards all the\u00a0 modern pueblos of the Archipelago\u00a0 were formed\u00a0 by taking as a basis for their establishment the\u00a0 barrios already populated by a large number of\u00a0 residents who, under the agreement to build the church of the\u00a0 new\u00a0 pueblo, the court-house, and afterwards the schoolhouse, obtained from the General Government\u00a0 the administrative separation of their barrio from the\u00a0 pueblo on which it depended and in whose territory it was previously comprised.\u00a0 In such cases procedure analogous to that\u00a0 prescribed by the Laws of the Indies was observed.<br\/><br\/>For the establishment, then, of new pueblos, the administrative authority of the province,\u00a0 in representation of the Governor-General, designated the\u00a0 territory\u00a0 for their location and extension and the metes and bounds of the same; and before allotting the lands among the\u00a0 new settlers, a special demarcation was made of\u00a0 the places which were to serve as the\u00a0 public square of the pueblo, for the erection of the church, and as sites for the public buildings,\u00a0 among others, the municipal building or the casa real, as well as of the lands which were to constitute the commons, pastures, and propios of the municipality and the streets and roads which were to intersect the new town were laid out, as may be seen by the following laws:<br\/><br\/>Law 7, title 7, book 4, of the Recompilation of the Laws of the Indies, provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"The district or territory to be given for settlement by composition shall be allotted in the following manner. There shall first be set apart the portion\u00a0 required for the lots\u00a0 of the pueblo,\u00a0 the <i>exido <\/i> or public\u00a0 lands, and pastures amply sufficient for the stock which the residents may have, and <i>as much more as propios del lugar or common lands of the locality; <\/i>the rest of the territory and district shall be divided into four parts - one of them, of his choice, shall be for him who takes upon himself the obligation to found the pueblo, and the other three shall be apportioned equally among the settlers.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Law\u00a0 8, of the same title and book, prescribes,\u00a0 among other things:<br\/><blockquote>\"That, between the main\u00a0 square and the church, there shall be constructed the casas reales or municipal buildings, the <i>cabildo,\u00a0 concejo, <\/i> customs buildings,\" etc.<br\/><\/blockquote>Law 14 of the said title and book, also directs among other things:<br\/><blockquote>\"That the viceroys shall have set aside such lands as\u00a0 to them appear suitable as the common lands\u00a0 {<i>propios<\/i>) of the pueblos that have none, therewith to assist in the payment of the salaries of the <i>corregidores<\/i>, and sufficient public lands (<i>exidos<\/i>) and pasture lands as provided for and prescribed by law.\"<\/blockquote>Law\u00a0 1, title 13 of the aforesaid\u00a0 book, provides the following:<br\/><blockquote>\"Such viceroys and governors as have due authority shall designate to each <i>villa<\/i> and\u00a0 <i>lugar <\/i>newly founded and settled the lands and lots which they may need and may be given to them, without detriment to a third party, as <i>propios<\/i>, and a statement\u00a0 shall be sent to us of what was designated and given to each,\u00a0 in order that we may have such\u00a0 action approved.\"<\/blockquote>The municipality of Catbalogan, as the provincial\u00a0 seat of Samar, must have been the first and oldest pueblo established in the said province and has been occupying, if not since time immemorial, as affirmed in the application, at least for a long period of years,\u00a0 some forty or forty-five years according to the evidence given\u00a0 at trial, the lot in litigation on\u00a0 which it\u00a0 had built the successive court-house buildings constructed\u00a0 for\u00a0 the\u00a0 public service of the head municipal authority and his council.\u00a0 Some of these buildings were burned and others were ruined by typhoons.\u00a0 The court-house building aforesaid has been used and enjoyed quietly and peaceably and without\u00a0 any opposition up to the present time, wherefore it is to be\u00a0 presumed that, on founding the pueblo and on proceeding to designate and demarcate the area of land to be\u00a0 occupied by the town of Catbalogan, with its square, streets, church, and other public buildings, the said lot was also designated' as a site for the municipal or court building, in accordance with the laws herein before mentioned, and that the adjudication of the lot to the municipality\u00a0 for\u00a0 its\u00a0 court-house\u00a0 was\u00a0 duly confirmed\u00a0 by the Spanish Government,\u00a0 as must be\u00a0 inferred,\u00a0 in\u00a0 view of the continuous possession for so long a time up to the present; nor does the record show that the court-house of the said pueblo was ever built on any\u00a0 other lot\u00a0 than the one in question.<br\/><br\/>It is to be noted that, in former times, the court-house buildings of\u00a0 the pueblos were called <i>casas reales<\/i>\u00a0 (royal buildings), undoubtedly for the purpose of giving greater dignity\u00a0 to the principle\u00a0 of authority represented in them and inculcating respect among the\u00a0 inhabitants of the pueblo toward the building w^iere the chief local authority exercised his governmental duties and\u00a0 at the same time administered justice, for\u00a0 the old <i>pedaneos<\/i> or petty mayors, later called <i>capitanes<\/i> or <i>gobernadorcillos,<\/i> while they had governmental powers, at\u00a0 the same time\u00a0 administered justice as local judges.<br\/><br\/>In paragraph 92\u00a0 of the royal ordinances of February 26, 1768, the following appears, among other things:<br\/><blockquote>\"And because, while there is a notable excess of pomp in the buildings of the ministers and parish priests, there is, on the other\u00a0 hand,\u00a0 great abandonment\u00a0 of the <i>casas reales<\/i> which, as a general rule,\u00a0 are not habitable on account of their uncomfortable and ruinous conditions, etc.,\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 * it is ordered that in all the pueblos, and especially in those of the seats of government, the native inhabitants thereof shall\u00a0 erect\u00a0 decent\u00a0 and\u00a0\u00a0 convenient\u00a0 municipal\u00a0 buildings modeled\u00a0 after the\u00a0 plans\u00a0 to\u00a0 be furnished by the central government, and that therein the gobernador cillos shall have their court rooms and their jails for the security of prisoners, and all leaks and\u00a0 other damages\u00a0 shall be\u00a0 repaired in time in order that, through neglect they may not cause greater detriment and expense.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>If the inhabitants of a pueblo, at the time of its foundation,\u00a0 were obliged\u00a0 to erect their casa\u00a0 real\u00a0 or municipal building, it is to be supposed that they built it on their own ground after a designation of the site had been made by the governmental\u00a0 authority of the\u00a0 province - a designation which had to be made, according to the Laws of the Indies, at the same time as that of the main plaza and of the site to be occupied by the temple or church, which latter building is so necessary\u00a0 and indispensable for every pueblo as well as the casa real or court-house, since in them, respectively, divine worship is had and the local authorities perform their duties.\u00a0\u00a0 The land designated for the church is considered to belong thereto, and likewise the land intended for the court-house should\u00a0 be deemed to be the property of the pueblo, awarded to it for the public uses of the municipality, since no\u00a0 pueblo was able to exist administratively without having a church of its own and a court-house which should be the seat of its local authority and its municipal government.<br\/><br\/>It should be remembered that the court-house and\u00a0 the church\u00a0 of every\u00a0 pueblo were always\u00a0 built, in accordance with the provisions of the Laws of the Indies, on one of the sides of the plaza mayor or main square of the town, either together or the same side,\u00a0 or\u00a0 each\u00a0 building on an opposite side; but\u00a0 the said square nearly always occupies a central site within the territory of the pueblo, with the\u00a0 frequent exception of where the town has extended toward only one end or side of the territory, in which event its main square ceased to be in the center of the town.\u00a0 However, the said square was never located outside of the inhabited place, as were the commons and pasturages.\u00a0 (Law 13, title 7, book 4, Recompilation of the Laws of the Indies.)<br\/><br\/>It\u00a0 is of course to be presumed1, in accordance with the provisions of the laws aforementioned, that the main square of the pueblo of Catbalogan occupies nearly the central part of its territory, and that the lot on which were successively constructed the several court-houses which the said pueblo has had, is situated on one of the\u00a0 sides of the said square and consequently in a central point\u00a0 and not outside the town.\u00a0 It can not, however, on account of this circumstance, be concluded that the said lot formed a part of the commons, <i>exido<\/i>, or the pasturage lands\u00a0 of the said pueblo, but consisted of land which belonged to the pueblo and was legally acquired through the\u00a0 distribution\u00a0 and adjudication\u00a0 of lots made at the beginning of its\u00a0 foundation, as proved by the laws\u00a0 hereinbefore quoted.<br\/><br\/>In\u00a0 technical administrative terms\u00a0 <i>bienes propios <\/i> are: Cultivated real properties, pasturages, houses or any other property which a city, village, or hamlet has for the\u00a0 payment of the public expenses.\u00a0 The administration of this class of property lay with the municipalities, and they could be alienated after proper procedure and authorization of the competent superior authorities in accordance with the administrative laws.<br\/><br\/>It is therefore\u00a0 unquestionable that\u00a0 the assets of each pueblo comprised\u00a0 its bienes propios\u00a0 and\u00a0 the revenues\u00a0 or products derived therefrom, and this fact is recognized\u00a0 in the <i>Ordenanza de Intendentes<\/i> of\u00a0 1786, the forty-seventh article of which reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"The funds which any pueblo may have left over as an annual surplus from\u00a0 the products\u00a0 of its property and its taxes, after meeting the expenses specified in its own particular ordinance, shall be\u00a0 invested in the purchase of real estate and revenue bearing investments, so that, having a sufficient income for the payment of its obligations and to aid in defraying its ordinary needs,\u00a0 the excise taxes, which are always a burden to the public,\u00a0 may be abolished; and in case\u00a0 it should have no such taxes, nor annuities\u00a0 to redeem on its common properties (<i>propios<\/i>), the said surplus shall be applied to promote establishments useful\u00a0 to the pueblo and to its\u00a0 province, or by investments\u00a0 to\u00a0 be previously proposed by the intendentes and approved by the <i> junta superior<\/i>.\"<\/blockquote>From the foregoing it is concluded that the land in question is the common property of the pueblo and is comprised within the patrimonial property of the municipality of Catbalogan, to\u00a0 which it\u00a0 was awarded for\u00a0 the construction thereon of the court-house, on the demarcation and distribution being made of the lands which were to be occupied by the town in its development, in accordance with the provisions\u00a0 of the\u00a0 Laws of the\u00a0 Indies,\u00a0 and other complementary laws,\u00a0 at a time when there was an excess of land and few inhabitants to occupy them.\u00a0 It was for this reason that the royal\u00a0 cedula\u00a0 of October 15, 1754, directed that neither the possessors of unappropriated\u00a0 crown lands, nor their successors\u00a0 in interest, should\u00a0 be\u00a0 disturbed\u00a0 or\u00a0 denounced, although they had no titles, it being sufficient for them\u00a0 to prove their prior possession to obtain a title by just prescription.<br\/><br\/>The said municipality is today in possession of the land in litigation,\u00a0 as the owner thereof, under the protection of the civil and\u00a0 administrative laws which guarantee the right of ownership of the corporations that are\u00a0 capable\u00a0 of contracting,\u00a0 acquiring,\u00a0 and\u00a0 possessing\u00a0 real\u00a0 and\u00a0 personal property.<br\/><br\/>Article 343 of the Civil Code\u00a0 reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"The property of provinces and of towns is divided into property for. public use and patrimonial property.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Article 344 of the same\u00a0 code prescribes:<br\/><blockquote>\"Property for public use in provinces and in towns comprises the provincial and town roads, the squares,\u00a0 streets, fountains, and public waters, the promenades, and public works of general service supported\u00a0 by the said\u00a0 towns or provinces.<br\/><br\/>\"All other property possessed\u00a0 by\u00a0 either is patrimonial, and shall be governed by the provisions of this code, unless otherwise prescribed in special laws.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Section 2 of Act No. 82, entitled \"The Municipal Code,\" is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"(<i>a<\/i>) Pueblos incorporated under\u00a0 this Act shall be designated as municipalities (<i>municipios<\/i>), and shall be known respectively by the names heretofore\u00a0 adopted.\u00a0 Under such names they may sue and be sued, contract and be contracted with, acquire and hold real and personal property\u00a0 for the general interests of the municipality, and exercise\u00a0 all the powers hereinafter conferred\u00a0 upon them.<br\/><br\/>\"(<i>b<\/i>) All property\u00a0 and\u00a0 property\u00a0 rights vested\u00a0 in any pueblo under its former organization shall continue to be vested in\u00a0 the\u00a0 same\u00a0 municipality after\u00a0 its\u00a0 incorporation under this Act.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>By this last-cited administrative Act the\u00a0 rights of the old municipalities to acquire real and personal property, in accordance with their former organization, are recognized, and it is declared that the\u00a0 said property and rights shall continue to pertain to the municipalities created in harmony with the provisions of the Municipal Code, on account of such property being the patrimonial property of the municipalities.<br\/><br\/>Under these principles, perfectly in accord with both the old and the mother legislation of\u00a0 this country, the municipality of Catbalogan ought to be considered as the owner of the land in question, on account of the same having been awarded to it as its own, under its exclusive ownership,\u00a0 on the founding of the pueblo, for the erection\u00a0 of the court-house, the record of the case showing no proof nor data to the contrary.\u00a0 As the plaintiff municipality, the applicant, has been occupying the property on which its court-house is situated during such a long space of time, much longer than that required for extraordinary prescription (art. 1959 of the Civil Code), it can not be denied that the presumption exists, in its favor, that .it has been holding the land in its character of owner, since the trial record exhibits no proof that any other parcel\u00a0 of land, distinct from that in controversy, was awarded to the\u00a0 said municipality for the erection thereon of its court-house, a court-house and the land on which to build it being necessary and indispensable for the existence of the pueblo.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 title under which the municipality\u00a0 of Catbalogan holds and enjoys the said lot is the same as that under which it is recognized as a pueblo and under which the municipality is justified\u00a0 in\u00a0 its present occupancy\u00a0 of the territory where the town is established with its streets, squares, and common lands (terreno comunal), a title identical with that now\u00a0 held by the church, as a religious institution, to the land\u00a0 now, occupied\u00a0 by\u00a0 the temple\u00a0 that exists in the said pueblo.<br\/><br\/>At the time of the beginning of the foundation of the pueblo mentioned and of the distribution or allotment of the lands among its first inhabitants, who, in\u00a0 accordance with the Laws of the Indies, must have numbered at least thirty men\u00a0 with\u00a0 their\u00a0 respective families, for\u00a0 the purpose\u00a0 of founding a pueblo, perhaps none of them was provided with any particular title to accredit the fact that\u00a0 this or\u00a0 that parcel of land had fallen to him in the allotment.\u00a0 Possibly the facts pertaining to the\u00a0 distribution of the lands were entered in the record kept of the organization of the pueblo, if one such was made, for it must\u00a0 be remembered that, in ancient times\u00a0 and up to the\u00a0 years immediately preceding the beginning of the nineteenth century, fewer records were made than in\u00a0 modern times, and, besides,\u00a0 the Laws of the Indies\u00a0 themselves\u00a0 recommended that,\u00a0 in administrative proceedings, the institution of suits should\u00a0 be avoided in so far as possible where verbal information and investigations could be had to enable proper action to be taken,<br\/><br\/>Besides the reasons hereinabove noted, there is that of the continuous and constant renovation of the personnel which composed the officials of a municipality in the Philippines, for the pedaneo or gobernadorcillo, his tenientes, judges, and other subordinates were first chosen\u00a0 and\u00a0 appointed annually, and later every two years; and, although in the beginning the capitan pedaneo of the pueblo may have had in his possession the record of the necessary concession and award of the land on which the court-house was built, and that of the pueblo of Catbalogan was constructed of stone, it would in nowise\u00a0 be strange that, in spite\u00a0 of the zeal and diligence which\u00a0 may\u00a0 have been\u00a0 exercised by\u00a0 his many successors, the said record or\u00a0 title should have disappeared or been\u00a0 destroyed\u00a0 in the case of Catbalogan, during the lapse of\u00a0 so long a time; indeed, it would be marvelous and extraordinary that\u00a0 such a document should\u00a0 exist, intrusted to the more or less diligent\u00a0 care of so many\u00a0 municipal officials who, at the most, occupied their offices but two years. It is certain, however, that the successive\u00a0 court-houses which\u00a0 the said pueblo has had have\u00a0 occupied the\u00a0 land in question\u00a0 without opposition on the part of anyone, or of the state, and\u00a0 including the\u00a0 building which served as a court-house, together with the land on which it is built, as one of the properties which form the assets of the pueblo of Catbalogan, as they should\u00a0 be classed, it is incontrovertible that the right of the said\u00a0 municipality therein must be respected, as the right of ownership is consecrated\u00a0 and sanctioned by the\u00a0 laws of every\u00a0 civilized country\u00a0 in the interest and\u00a0 for the benefit of society, public order,\u00a0 and civtt&amp;ation itself.<br\/><br\/>As has been shown in the preceding paragraphs, the\u00a0 land in litigation, which is a lot\u00a0 occupied\u00a0 by the court-house, anciently termed the casa real, of the pueblo of Catbalogan, pertains\u00a0 to the said pueblo,\u00a0 awarded to\u00a0 the same, not gratuitously,\u00a0 but on account of the necessity arising from its organization, and forms a\u00a0 part, as a patrimonial property, of its municipal assets,\u00a0 and therefore it\u00a0 is not comprised within the common land (<i>terreno comunal<\/i>) which may have been granted to the said pueblo. Law 8, title 3, book 6 of the Recompilation of the Laws of the Indies, is not applicable to the question at issue with respect to the said land or\u00a0 lot,\u00a0 nor are the\u00a0 provisions of article 53\u00a0 of the ordinances of good government, before cited, of February 26, 1768, nor the subsequent royal decrees of February 28, August 1,\u00a0 1883,\u00a0 and of January 17, 1885, relative to the <i>legua or terreno comunal<\/i>; and, consequently, the doctrine laid down in the decision rendered in the case of The City of Manila <i>vs.<\/i> The Insular Government (10 Phil. Rep., 327) is likewise inapplicable, for the\u00a0 reason\u00a0 that\u00a0 the\u00a0 land in dispute is not that of a common, but of a building lot of which\u00a0 the\u00a0 pueblo of Catbalogan had absolute\u00a0 need at the beginning of its organization for the erection thereon of its court-house.\u00a0 This was duly\u00a0 proved\u00a0 at trial,\u00a0 without possible contradiction.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding the number\u00a0 of years during which the municipality\u00a0 of Catbalogan has been in possession of the lot, once it has been shown by unquestionable evidence that the property was assigned to it as\u00a0 its\u00a0 own, in order that it might erect its court-house thereon,\u00a0 as\u00a0 it did do at the beginning of its foundation, and its possession\u00a0 of the said land not being by\u00a0 mere\u00a0 unlawful occupation,\u00a0 the\u00a0 municipality has no need to rely upon the right of prescription, although, being entitled to acquire and\u00a0 possess property in the character of\u00a0 owner, according to its organic law, it is not understood\u00a0 why it\u00a0 could not acquire such right by prescription\u00a0 in accordance with law, it being, as\u00a0 it is, a juridical person susceptible of rights and duties.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 present\u00a0 case has nothing to do with any contract made by the\u00a0 old\u00a0 municipality of Catbalogan, nor administrative acts or procedure of the applicant\u00a0 herein,\u00a0 but relates to its right of ownership\u00a0 in a\u00a0 parcel of\u00a0 land vested with the character of <i>bien propio<\/i> of its own, or patrimonial property; for\u00a0 which\u00a0 reason the doctrine established in the decision\u00a0 rendered in the case of Aguado <i>vs<\/i>. The\u00a0 City of Manila (9 Phil. Rep., 513) is also inapplicable, inasmuch as the said\u00a0 municipality, in the exercise\u00a0 of the right of ownership in its\u00a0 own\u00a0 property, has\u00a0 ail independent personality of its own, recognized\u00a0 by law, and does not act as a mere delegate of the central authority.<br\/><br\/>For\u00a0 the foregoing reasons,\u00a0 and\u00a0 considering that\u00a0 the municipality of Catbalogan is the owner\u00a0 of the land occupied by its court-house and that it is entitled\u00a0 to have the said property registered in\u00a0 its name in the Court of Land Registration,\u00a0 it is proper, in our\u00a0 opinion, to\u00a0 affirm and we hereby affirm the judgment appealed from\u00a0 in its present form.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.J., Moreland<\/i> and <i>Trent, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><\/div>",

The fact of plaintiff's coverture does not appear on the face of the complaint but it was raised by answer, and one of the special\u00a0 defenses in\u00a0 the answer was that plaintiff has no capacity to sue, this\u00a0 special\u00a0 defense being based on\u00a0 the provisions of section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br\/><br\/>Judgment was rendered in favor of the defendant company, dismissing the complaint, with costs, on\u00a0 the ground that the plaintiff did not have the legal capacity to bring this action without joining her husband. The plaintiff appealed and during the pendency\u00a0 of the appeal this\u00a0 court, upon motion, allowed the plaintiff to\u00a0 amend her complaint by striking out\u00a0 that\u00a0 part which refers to\u00a0 damages for\u00a0 the alleged\u00a0 illegal\u00a0 detention of the steamer, leaving as\u00a0 the subject\u00a0 matter of the action the steamer only,;\u00a0\u00a0 Before\u00a0 the amendment was made plaintiff's husband ffiad\u00a0 an interest or\u00a0 right\u00a0 in the income from this\u00a0 steamer.\u00a0\u00a0 (Quison <i> vs.<\/i> Salud, 12 Phil.

that\u00a0 Veloso, as the legal representative of his wife, sold to the defendant company on the 19th of August, 1905, with the right to repurchase within\u00a0 ten\u00a0 years, various parcels of real\u00a0 estate for the sum of P6,478, said amount to be applied on Veloso's debt to defendant company; that on the same\u00a0 date\u00a0 and under the same conditions\/Veloso,\u00a0 in his own name, sold to the defendant company for the sum of P13,583, to\u00a0 be applied on\u00a0 his\u00a0 debt, a number of parcels of real\u00a0 property; that in that same document, dated the 19th of August, 1905, Veloso promised to pay P2,000 a month on his indebtedness, guaranteeing this payment by, as he said, all of his property, credits, and interest which constituted his business in Leyte; that in a notarial document duly executed on\u00a0 the 3d of August, 1904, Veloso acknowledged himself to be indebted to Aldecoa &amp; Co. in certain other specified sums, guaranteeing the payment of tnese amounts with the steamer <i>San Rafael<\/i>, the said boat being his own property; that a final liquidation of all\u00a0 the accounts\u00a0 was made, resulting\u00a0 in Veloso\u00a0 owing Aldecoa &amp;\u00a0 Co. the\u00a0 sum of\u00a0 P129,749.65;\u00a0 that\u00a0 after this liquidation,\u00a0 and by\u00a0 virtue of this document,\u00a0 Exhibit\u00a0 A, Veloso, for\u00a0 himself and as the legal representative\u00a0 of his wife,\u00a0 by and with the consent of the legal representative of the\u00a0 defendant company, modified the former sales of the real property, with the\u00a0 right to repurchase, and converted the same into an\u00a0 absolute\u00a0 sale in favor of the defendant company, together with other specified property belonging to him, in payment\u00a0 of his indebtedness.\u00a0 Paragraphs\u00a0 (<i>e<\/i>) and (<i>f<\/i>) of this document, Exhibit A, are as follows:<br\/><br\/>\"(<i>e<\/i>)\u00a0 There should be\u00a0 excluded from the foregoing assignment, cession, and transfer, the steamer San Rafael,\u00a0 which will hereafter be the exclusive property of my wife, Casiana Bismorte, in consideration of the property by her\u00a0 transferred and\u00a0 assigned in\u00a0 payment\u00a0 of part of the aforesaid indebtedness.<br\/><br\/>\"(<i>f)<\/i>\u00a0 It is further stipulated\u00a0 and agreed that\u00a0 Casiana Bismorte shall execute, within the maximum period of two months, a notarial instrument, ratifying the present one, otherwise Aldecoa\u00a0 &amp; Co. can either insist upon the validity of this instrument or\u00a0 have\u00a0 the\u00a0 same\u00a0 rescinded, leaving everything in the same\u00a0 condition\u00a0 in which it was\u00a0 prior to the execution of the present agreement, demanding payment of all the amounts due them from the said Manuel Veloso, and such interest as may have accrued thereon.\"<br\/><br\/>The defendant\u00a0 now insists that it has not been shown that the property\u00a0 transferred by the plaintiff to the defendant in payment of a part of her husband's indebtedness was acquired by her separate funds, nor even that it belonged to her.\u00a0 The defendant is estopped from now raising this question, as it dealt with the\u00a0 plaintiff's husband on the theory that the plaintiff was the owner of these lands.\u00a0\u00a0 The parties\u00a0 to\u00a0 this contract\u00a0 treated this fact as specifically settled.\u00a0 That\u00a0 the plaintiff was the owner of\u00a0 this\u00a0 real property forms a part of the\u00a0 very\u00a0 basis\u00a0 of the\u00a0 contract itself; in fact it is the basis or\u00a0 foundation of this contract as far\u00a0 as the plaintiff is\u00a0 concerned.\u00a0\u00a0 That she was the exclusive owner of the lands can not now be questioned by the defendant.\u00a0 It is estopped\u00a0 by the\u00a0 contract itself.\u00a0 It accepted the lands as the\u00a0 property of the plaintiff, and it would now be\u00a0 against the plainest principles of justice to allow it\u00a0 to deny that the plaintiff was the exclusive owner of those lands.<br\/><br\/>According to the contract, Exhibit A, plaintiff's husband obligated himself\u00a0 to do certain things.\u00a0 He also, on behalf of his wife, obligated her to perform\u00a0 certain acts.\u00a0\u00a0 The defendant accepted these obligations with the corresponding reciprocation.\u00a0\u00a0 The obligations on the part of the plaintiff and her husband\u00a0 were distinct and separate.\u00a0 She had nothing\u00a0 to do with the fulfillment of this contract, except to consent to the\u00a0 conversion of the provisional sale of her lands to an absolute sale in favor of the defendant and to ratify this\u00a0 sale within the period of\u00a0 two months.\u00a0\u00a0 She consented to the\u00a0 converting of the\u00a0 provisional sale\u00a0 into an absolute one, but the record does not show whether or not she\u00a0 executed\u00a0 a document ratifying this absolute\u00a0 sale, as provided in paragraph (<i>f), supra<\/i>.\u00a0 But\u00a0 this\u00a0 is\u00a0 immaterial, as the fact\u00a0 that she brought this action, seeking the fulfillment\u00a0 of\u00a0 the contract,\u00a0 is conclusive proof of her ratification, and if she never executed a document ratifying the same her conduct is a sufficient ratification.\u00a0 She therefore complied en toto with her part of this obligation.\u00a0\u00a0 She can\u00a0 not be held responsible if\u00a0 her husband\u00a0 has\u00a0 failed to comply with his part of the contract, as no stipulation to this effect\u00a0 was made.\u00a0 The\u00a0 defendant did\u00a0 not\u00a0 demand, neither does it appear in the\u00a0 contract, that the fulfillment of same\u00a0 between it and the plaintiff would\u00a0 be dependent upon the\u00a0 husband's compliance with\u00a0 his obligations.\u00a0\u00a0 We can\u00a0 not determine whether her\u00a0 husband has,\u00a0 in fact,\u00a0 complied with his part of the contract or not, but this is immaterial in this case.<br\/><br\/>It having been settled that the lands\u00a0 (which were\u00a0 mentioned in\u00a0 the contract as belonging to the plaintiff)\u00a0 were the\u00a0 plaintiff's exclusive\u00a0 property,\u00a0 and these\u00a0 lands\u00a0 having been exchanged, according to\u00a0 the contract, for the steamer in question, ther said steamer,\u00a0 under article 1396\u00a0 of the Civil Code, became the paraphernal or\u00a0 exclusive\u00a0 property of the plaintiff.\u00a0 The defendant specifically agreed in the contract that the steamer should become\u00a0 the exclusive property of the plaintiff,\u00a0 the consideration being the plaintiff's lands.\u00a0 Under the plain terms of this contract any defense which the defendant might set up against the\u00a0 plaintiff's husband\u00a0 for his failure to comply with\u00a0 his part\u00a0 of the contract can not be interposed against the plaintiff, as she has fulfilled her obligations.\u00a0\u00a0 The defendant received from the plaintiff what it\u00a0 then considered a valuable consideration when\u00a0 the\u00a0 contract was\u00a0 executed,\u00a0 in so far\u00a0 as the contract\u00a0 affected the plaintiff.\u00a0 As to whether or\u00a0 not it has any meritorious\u00a0 defenses\u00a0 which are not\u00a0 stated in the contract against the plaintiff must be left for\u00a0 future determination.\u00a0\u00a0 It was specifically agreed in the\u00a0 contract,\u00a0 as we\u00a0 have said, that\u00a0 the plaintiff\u00a0 should be the exclusive owner of the steamer\u00a0 San Rafael.\u00a0\u00a0 In the\u00a0 face\u00a0 of\u00a0 this express agreement, the defendant seeks to avoid complying with its part of\u00a0 this obligation, in so far as the plaintiff is concerned, by now claiming\u00a0 that\u00a0 the plaintiff's\u00a0 husband has an interest\u00a0 in this\u00a0 steamer.\u00a0\u00a0 We think that this\u00a0 is a clear case of estoppel by contract.\u00a0\u00a0 As the defendant had agreed\u00a0 that the plaintiff\u00a0 should\u00a0 be the exclusive owner of the\u00a0 boat it should not now be\u00a0 permitted\u00a0 to\u00a0 say that her\u00a0 husband has an interest in it.The estoppel of the defendant was\u00a0 fixed\u00a0 hy the\u00a0 execution\u00a0 of the\u00a0 contract. Nothing1 further need be shown where the fact in\u00a0 question, as in this case, has been clearly agreed upon.\u00a0 This position was taken by the defendant\u00a0 when it executed the contract in question. The plaintiff acted upon\u00a0 this theory.\u00a0 The defendant can not now change its position to the prejudice of the plaintiff.\u00a0\u00a0 The defendant can\u00a0 not now deny this fact in regard to its position, it having acted with full knowledge of its rights and all the material facts.<br\/><blockquote>\"A party can\u00a0 not either in the course of litigation or in dealings in\u00a0 pais occupy inconsistent positions.\u00a0\u00a0 Upon that rule election is\u00a0 founded;\u00a0 'a\u00a0 man shall not be\u00a0 allowed,' in the language of the Scotch law, 'to approbate and reprobate.'\u00a0\u00a0 And where a man has an\u00a0 election between several inconsistent courses of\u00a0 action,\u00a0 he will be confined to that which he\u00a0 first adopts; the election,\u00a0 if\u00a0 made with knowledge of the facts, is in itself binding; it can not be withdrawn without due consent; it\u00a0 can not be withdrawn though\u00a0 it has\u00a0 not been\u00a0 acted upon\u00a0 by another\u00a0 b;y any change of position.\"\u00a0 (Bigelow on Estoppel, p. 673.)<\/blockquote>In the case of Daniels <i>vs.<\/i>\u00a0 Tearney (102 U. S., 415), the suit was brought by Tearney and\u00a0 Wilson, executors\u00a0 of Collin\u00a0 C. Porter.\u00a0 The complaint set forth that\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendants\u00a0 on\u00a0 the\u00a0 1st day of\u00a0 June, 1861,\u00a0 made their joint and\u00a0 several bond whereby they bound themselves to pay to the plaintiff a certain specified sum of money when requested, and that there was a condition affixed\u00a0 to the bond which was \"That, whereas on the 25th day of March, 1861, a writ fieri facias was issued from the clerk's office in the name of Porter against one\u00a0 Daniels for\u00a0 a certain sum of money,\u00a0 with interest from the 2d day of January,\u00a0 1860, and\u00a0 costs; if, therefore, the said Daniels should\u00a0 pay\u00a0 the debt,\u00a0 interest, and costs, when the operation\u00a0 of the ordinance before mentioned\u00a0 should cease, then the obligation to be void, otherwise to be in full force.\"\u00a0 In April, 1861, a convention of the State of Virginia passed an ordinance of secession, and on the 30th of that month a law entitled \"An ordinance to provide against the sacrifice of property and to suspend proceedings in certain cases.\"\u00a0 It was under this law or ordinance that the bond sued upon was\u00a0 given. When this suit was brought the defendants pleaded, among other things, the unconstitutionality\u00a0 of that statute and ordinance.\u00a0 This law\u00a0 was held by\u00a0 the\u00a0 Supreme\u00a0 Court of the United States to be directly repugnant to the constitutional provisions which forbid the impairment of\u00a0 contracts by State laws.\u00a0\u00a0 It also held that the bond sued upon, as a statutory\u00a0 instrument, was likewise void, but held that the defendants\u00a0 were\u00a0 estopped\u00a0 from raising the question of the validity of the statute and bond, the court saying:<br\/><blockquote>\"The principle of estoppel\u00a0 thus applied has its foundation in a wise and salutary policy.\u00a0 It is\u00a0 a means of repose. It promotes fair dealing.\u00a0 It can not be made an instrument of wrong or oppression,\u00a0 and it often gives triumph to right and justice,\u00a0 where nothing else known to our\u00a0 jurisprudence\u00a0 can, by\u00a0 its\u00a0 operation, secure\u00a0 those ends.\u00a0\u00a0 Like the statute of limitations,\u00a0 it is a conservator, and without it society could not well go on.\"<\/blockquote>The court in quoting\u00a0 from\u00a0 the\u00a0 case of Ferguson<i> vs<\/i>. Landram\u00a0 (5 Bush\u00a0 (Ky.), 230), cited in the above case, said:<br\/><blockquote>\"Upon what principle of exalted\u00a0 equity shall a man be permitted\u00a0 to receive a valuable consideration through\u00a0 a statute, procured by his own consent or\u00a0 subsequently sanctioned by him, or from which he derived an interest and consideration, and then keep the\u00a0 consideration,\u00a0 and repudiate the statute?\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In applying this principle to the\u00a0 case at bar we might likewise ask\u00a0 upon what principle of exalted equity shall a\u00a0 man be permitted to\u00a0 receive a\u00a0 valuable\u00a0 consideration, through a contract, procured by his\u00a0 own consent, with full knowledge of all of his rights\u00a0 and of all the material facts, and then\u00a0 keep\u00a0 the consideration (the land in this case) and repudiate the contract?\u00a0 Parties are precluded\u00a0 from contradicting their solemn admissions or statements deliberately made in their contracts under these circumstances. The defendant company in\u00a0 this contract specifically agreed that the steamer should be the exclusive property of the plaintiff. It was upon\u00a0 this\u00a0 agreement that\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiff parted with her lands.\u00a0\u00a0 It would not\u00a0 now be just to permit it to retain the lands and question her exclusive ownership, between herself and her husband, of this boat.<br\/><blockquote>\"It is a principle of law of universal application (and as just as it is\u00a0 general) that\u00a0 admissions, whether of. law or of fact, which have been acted upon by others are conclusive\u00a0 against the party making them, in all cases between him and the\u00a0 person whose conduct he has thus influenced; and the principle is founded upon grounds of public policy, that a\u00a0 man shall not be permitted\u00a0 to repudiate his own representations.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Toppan <i>vs.<\/i> Cleveland, C.\u00a0 &amp; C.

VALENTIN DE JOSE, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/>\n<br\/>\nD E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">On the night of April 13, 1908, Valentin de Jose entered the house of Silverio de la Cruz, and, after an altercation that arose between both men, Valentin, who was armed, attacked the owner of the house with a kris or holo, inflicting upon him five wounds - one in the right side, through which the intestines protruded; another in the back, another in the calf of the leg, and two others in the arm and the palm of the left hand.\u00a0\u00a0 As a result of these wounds the assaulted party died at a certain distance from the house, whither he was dragged by his aggressor.\u00a0 A post-mortem examination of the body of the deceased showed that it bore three stab wounds, one in the right side, another\u00a0 in the lumbar region of the left side,\u00a0 and the third in the\u00a0 right shoulder-blade in addition\u00a0 to\u00a0 two wounds of the nature\u00a0 of cuts,\u00a0 one in the\u00a0 left\u00a0 hand\u00a0 and the other in\u00a0 the\u00a0 left foot.\u00a0 The said examination was made by a <i>curandero,<\/i>\u00a0 or medical\u00a0 practitioner, who testified at the trial of the cause,\u00a0 though the court decided that his\u00a0 testimony\u00a0 was admissible, inasmuch as he had seen\u00a0 the said wounds, but not as an expert,\u00a0 on account of\u00a0 his not being\u00a0 a\u00a0 physician nor experienced in such matters, notwithstanding that he made the examination by order of the justice of the peace.<br\/><br\/>Because of the preceding facts, a complaint was filed in the Court of First Instance of Capiz by the provincial fiscal, on\u00a0 May 19, 1908, accusing Valentin de\u00a0 Jose of the\u00a0 crime of murder.\u00a0 The trial having been held, the court, in view of the evidence adduced, rendered judgment, on December 15\u00a0 of\u00a0 the same year, finding the defendant guilty\u00a0 of\u00a0 the crime\u00a0 of homicide and\u00a0 sentenced\u00a0 him to the penalty of fifteen years' <i>reclusion temporal<\/i>, to the accessory penalties, to pay an indemnity of P1,000 to the heirs of the deceased, and the\u00a0 costs.\u00a0 From this judgment an appeal was\u00a0 taken.<br\/><br\/>Conclusive evidence was adduced at the trial of the violent death of Silverio de la Cruz as the result of\u00a0 five wounds, one of them, that received in the right side, of a serious and mortal nature.\u00a0 The\u00a0 crime committed is that\u00a0 of homicide, provided for and punished by article 404 of the Penal Code, inasmuch as the record does not show that its perpetration was attended by\u00a0 any of the specific and qualifying circumstances\u00a0 of homicide which\u00a0 convert it\u00a0 into murder and are\u00a0 enumerated in article 403 of\u00a0 the same code,\u00a0 nor by those\u00a0 of premeditation\u00a0 and treachery,\u00a0 expressed\u00a0 in\u00a0 the complaint.\u00a0 Sufficient evidence was not adduced to prove that the aggressor deliberately,\u00a0 and with premeditation, conceived the definite purpose of\u00a0 depriving the deceased of his\u00a0 life,\u00a0 nor that the said aggressor availed\u00a0 himself of ways and means\u00a0 tending\u00a0 directly\u00a0 to obtain\u00a0 the consummation of the crime without such\u00a0 risk to his\u00a0 person as might\u00a0 originate from any defense offered by the assaulted party,\u00a0 for the aggressor, provided with a bob or kris and a lance, entered the house of the deceased on the night of the crime, and, after an altercation between the two, the defendant Valentin de Jose, who was drunk, seeing that\u00a0 De la Cruz firmly refused to accompany him to a dance hall, in anger attacked the deceased in the\u00a0 presence of the latter's wife and struck him repeated\u00a0 blows with a bolo or kris, first in the\u00a0 calf of the leg, then in\u00a0 the right side, through which\u00a0 wound the intestines, protruded, on the palm\u00a0 of the hand, on the\u00a0 left arm and on the shoulder;\u00a0 immediately thereafter he dragged the wounded man, almost dead, outside of the house and to a distance of 20 meters, where the body was afterwards found by the agents of\u00a0 the Government authorities.<br\/><br\/>The defendant, Valentin\u00a0 de\u00a0 Jose, was\u00a0 proved to be the sole perpetrator, by direct participation, of the said serious crime and was convicted\u00a0 thereof.\u00a0\u00a0 His exculpatory allegations can not be\u00a0 admitted, as they are\u00a0 absolutely\u00a0 devoid of proof and obviously improbable.<br\/><br\/>The facts were perfectly well established that the defendant, being armed, entered the house of the deceased on the said night and that, after a dispute brought about by the refusal\u00a0 of the owner of the house to accept his invitation to go to a house where there was\u00a0 a dance, he attacked the deceased,\u00a0 in the presence of the latter's wife, inflicting upon him the wounds which caused his death.\u00a0 Although\u00a0 the wife, possessed by fear because of what she had seen, fled from the house and hid\u00a0 herself in a nearby wood, it is certain\u00a0 that she saw the defendant drag the wounded man, almost dead, out of the house, which was low and had no stairs, and take him or his\u00a0 body to a place about 40 yards away, where in fact it was found several\u00a0 hours afterwards by agents of the Government authorities.<br\/><br\/>The defendant alleged that the\u00a0 deceased awaited him at the place where they quarreled and, armed with a bolo and a lance, attacked him, wherefore he,\u00a0 in order to defend himself, had to engage in a struggle with the\u00a0 deceased,\u00a0 who, in the midst of the struggle, inflicted upon himself with his own bolo the wounds from which he died, and that after defendant had succeeded in snatching away the weapon\u00a0 he left the place, leaving the deceased stretched out on the ground. This allegation is entirely unsubstantiated, is incredible in itself on account of its unlikelihood, in view of the number of wounds borne by the body of the deceased, and does not appear to be corroborated even by circumstantial evidence, inasmuch\u00a0 as it is undeniable that the assault took place in the house of the deceased on an occasion when the latter was disarmed and could\u00a0 not\u00a0 so much as defend himself from the attack, according to the testimony of\u00a0 the victim's wife, who saw the beginning of the assault and was present at the time; and if, afterwards, the body was found outside the house about 40 yards away, it was because it had been conveyed\u00a0 there by\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant,\u00a0 for the\u00a0 purpose undoubtedly of giving an appearance of truth to the allegation, made in his defense, that the deceased awaited him there to assault him.<br\/><br\/>Under the well-founded hypothesis that Silverio de la Cruz was assaulted and received his five wounds in his house, the fact admitted\u00a0 by the defendant that he struggled with the deceased, though out of the house and in another\u00a0 place and\u00a0 without arms, according\u00a0 to his unsupported allegation, united with the fact that the deceased died as the result of five\u00a0 wounds, constitutes unimpeachable\u00a0 proof that the slayer or the author of the wounds followed by the death of the deceased was the defendant, the only one who quarreled with the latter on the night in which\u00a0 he\u00a0 was killed; and because of the lack of proof of the facts\u00a0 alleged\u00a0 by the aggressor his guilt as\u00a0 the author of the death of\u00a0 his opponent must be considered as established.<br\/><br\/>With respect\u00a0 to the commission of the\u00a0 crime, we\u00a0 must consider the\u00a0 presence of the twentieth aggravating circumstance of article 10,\u00a0 that is, that of the crime having been perpetrated in the dwelling of the deceased, who is not shown to have\u00a0 provoked the same.\u00a0\u00a0 This\u00a0 circumstance is counterbalanced in its effects by\u00a0 the extenuating\u00a0 one of intoxication, the sixth of article 9 of the Penal Code,\u00a0 since the record does not show that the defendant was habitually intoxicated; wherefore, these two circumstances compensating each other,\u00a0 the\u00a0 penalty should be imposed upon the defendant in the medium degree.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons,\u00a0 and considering the judgment appealed from\u00a0 to\u00a0 be in accord with the law, it is, in our opinion, proper to affirm,\u00a0 and we hereby affirm, the judgment, with the\u00a0 costs against\u00a0 the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i> Arellano, C.

MARIANO MARTINEZ, DEFENDANT  AND APPELLEE.<br\/>\n<br\/>\nD E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">On October 28, 1909, Marcelo Susara filed a written complaint in the\u00a0 Court\u00a0 of First Instance of this city, against Mariano Martinez, the administrator of the intestate estate of the late Francisco Martinez, who, during his lifetime, was declared incapable of the management of his property, for which reason Attorney Vicente Ilustre was appointed guardian on March\u00a0 30, 1906.\u00a0 Upon the death\u00a0 of the said Francisco\u00a0 Martinez, on January 21, 1909, the guardian Ilustre ceased to\u00a0 act and\u00a0 the said Mariano Martinez was appointed\u00a0 by the court\u00a0 as administrator of the\u00a0 intestate estate left\u00a0 by the\u00a0 said Francisco Martinez.\u00a0\u00a0 It was alleged in the complaint that, on the said date of March 30, 1906, Ilustre, in his capacity of guardian of the latter, made with the plaintiff a contract of loan\u00a0 and\u00a0 of acknowledgment\u00a0 of a\u00a0 debt in\u00a0 favor of\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiff\u00a0 for\u00a0 the sum\u00a0 of P4,125, secured by the property situated at Nos, 93, 95, and 97 Calle Sevilla, Manila,\u00a0 owned by the said Martinez; that the said. contract\u00a0 was embodied in a public instrument executed for the purpose, a copy of which, marked with the letter A, was exhibited with the complaint and made an integral part thereof;\u00a0 that the said contract was approved by the court on April 3 of the year before mentioned, and that the plaintiff continued to be the legitimate owner of the aforesaid credit and security; that, in accordance with the instrument above referred\u00a0 to, the\u00a0 said sum of P4,125 was to be refunded\u00a0 to the plaintiff within\u00a0 a term of three years, from the 30th of March, 1906, which term had\u00a0 expired on March 30, 1909. The complaint further recited that, in accordance with the instrument\u00a0 before mentioned, the debtor Martinez,\u00a0 or his representative, was obliged to pay to the\u00a0 plaintiff annually P367.50 as interest on his debt;\u00a0 but that neither the debtor nor his representative had, up to the date of the complaint, refunded the said amount and had only paid the plaintiff P244 as interest for the last year, wherefore, it was alleged, that the said\u00a0 Martinez then owed,\u00a0 as interest,\u00a0 P123.50, which, together with the principal to be repaid, amounted to the sum of\u00a0 P4,248.50; and that, by such failure to pay the\u00a0 principal and interest, loss and damage was sustained by the plaintiff to the amount of P246.\u00a0 The latter therefore asked that judgment be rendered in his favor to compel the\u00a0 defendant\u00a0 to pay him the total sum of P4,494.50, together with legal\u00a0 interest thereon from the date of the filing of the complaint\u00a0 until the amount due should be fully paid, and that, in case of\u00a0 insolvency, <i>the sale at\u00a0 public auction of\u00a0 the property\u00a0 mentioned be decreed, and that\u00a0 the net proceeds obtained therefrom be applied\u00a0 to the payment\u00a0 of the\u00a0 judgment.<\/i><br\/><br\/>The instrument, Exhibit A,\u00a0 shows that Vicente Ilustre, the\u00a0 guardian of Francisco Martinez y Garcia, party of the first part,\u00a0 and Marcelo Susara, party of the second part, made\u00a0 the\u00a0 following\u00a0 statements: The former\u00a0 stated that his ward Martinez y Garcia was the owner of a house and lot situated on Calle Sevilla, Binondo, and designated by the numbers 93, 95, and 97, and that, in\u00a0 his capacity of guardian and with the approval of the court, he mortgaged the said property by\u00a0 a special preferred mortgage in favor\u00a0 of the other contracting party for the sum of P4,125, under the following conditions:\u00a0 Susara was to\u00a0 deliver to him, as\u00a0 in fact he did,\u00a0 the\u00a0 sum\u00a0 of P2,000, for the purposes of the contract; that Marcelo Susara held a credit\u00a0 against Francisco Martinez of P2,125, verbally acknowledged\u00a0 by the latter\u00a0 and previously\u00a0 affirmed by\u00a0 a partial payment\u00a0 on account, as recorded at the foot of the original instrument of the date of July 8,\u00a0 1903, and subscribed by the debtor, Martinez y Garcia, which document was made a part of the said instrument Exhibit A.\u00a0 The said credit of P2,125 also constituted\u00a0 an\u00a0 encumbrance on\u00a0 the\u00a0 property\u00a0 described, which amount,\u00a0 together with the P2,000\u00a0 before mentioned, formed the total\u00a0 sum of the mortgage.\u00a0 The said P2,000 was\u00a0 to\u00a0 earn\u00a0 12 per cent\u00a0 interest per annum and the remainder, P2,125, 6 per cent only, and the term of the mortgage was to be two years,\u00a0 extendible for another year, at the will of the said party of the first part.\u00a0\u00a0 The creditor, Marcelo Susara, stated that he accepted the\u00a0 contract in all its parts, and the instrument was signed by\u00a0 both contracting parties on the 30th\u00a0 of\u00a0 March, in the presence of two witnesses,\u00a0 and its contents\u00a0 were ratified on\u00a0 the same date before a notary public.\u00a0 At the end of the instrument appears a note of approval, signed by Judge A. S. Crossfield, under date of April 3, 1906, and bearing the stamp of the court.<br\/><br\/>Following the said instrument and attached thereto, is a copy of a promissory note, dated July 8,\u00a0 subscribed by Francisco Martinez,\u00a0 made payable on the 23d of October of that year to the\u00a0 order of Marcelo Susara, for the sum of P2,600, value thereof being\u00a0 acknowledged as\u00a0 received from the said Susara in jewelry set\u00a0 with\u00a0 diamonds, a solitaire ring, and\u00a0 a\u00a0 pair of diamond earrings mounted in gold. Under the signature of\u00a0 the debtor there is\u00a0 a note which reads: \"Paid on\u00a0 account a\u00a0 credit of P600.\"\u00a0\u00a0 This note is also\u00a0 signed by Martinez.<br\/><br\/>The defendant in his answer\u00a0 to the foregoing complaint denied paragraphs 8,\u00a0 9, and 10 thereof and each\u00a0 and all of their\u00a0 parts.\u00a0\u00a0 These paragraphs refer to the allegations of the plaintiff to the effect that the debtor was obliged to pay\u00a0 an\u00a0 annual interest of P367.50; that the former only received P244 as\u00a0 interest; that the debtor owes him, the plaintiff, for principal and\u00a0 interest, the sum of P4,248.50 and that the failure\u00a0 to pay the same\u00a0 caused\u00a0 the latter loss and damages to the amount of P246.\u00a0 As a special defense, the defendant alleged that the question involved was a claim against\u00a0 the estate of a deceased person, for the settlement of which the court had appointed commissioners in accordance with the law.\u00a0 He therefore asked that\u00a0 the complaint be dismissed, with the costs against the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>The case having come to trial, with oral evidence\u00a0 introduced on the part of\u00a0 the plaintiff, the court, on March 7 of the present year, rendered judgment by dismissing the complaint, without special finding as to costs.\u00a0 Counsel for the plaintiff filed an exception to the judgment and asked for a new trial, on the ground that the findings were\u00a0 contrary to the evidence and the law.\u00a0 This motion was overruled by the court, exception was taken by the plaintiff, the necessary bill\u00a0 of exceptions was filed on March 31\u00a0 of the current year, and, in view of the opposition to the approval thereof, entered by\u00a0 counsel for the defendant upon\u00a0 the ground that.it\u00a0 was not\u00a0 presented in due time - a fact admitted by the plaintiff\u00a0 the court, holding that the question as to whether the appeal was improperly admitted was one within the competency of the Supreme Court\u00a0 to decide on motion to dismiss, approved the\u00a0 said bill of exceptions\u00a0 and ordered that it be forwarded to\u00a0 the clerk of this court.<br\/><br\/>The action prosecuted by Marcelo Susara in the complaint herein above mentioned is unquestionably a mortgage\u00a0 action and has for its object the collection of a credit secured by real property,\u00a0 under the provisions of section 254\u00a0 and following of the Code of Civil Procedure, judging from the nature of the petition made by the plaintiff in his complaint, for he\u00a0 prays that, in case\u00a0 of\u00a0 insolvency in\u00a0 the\u00a0 amount claimed, the property alleged as mortgaged be\u00a0 ordered sold at public\u00a0 auction and the net proceeds of the\u00a0 sale applied to the payment of the judgment sought.<br\/><br\/>The court, after due consideration of the arguments presented by both sides, dismissed the complaint, on the ground that the instrument purporting\u00a0 to be\u00a0 a mortgage of\u00a0 the property situated at Nos. 93, 95, and 97, Calle Sevilla,\u00a0 district of Binondo, given as security for the fulfillment\u00a0 of an obligation stipulated therein, does not appear\u00a0 to be\u00a0 registered\u00a0 in the registry of\u00a0 property, wherefore no mortgage credit legally exists in this case, nor does any action\u00a0 based thereon lie with the\u00a0 creditor, but the\u00a0 latter should\u00a0 have presented his claim to the commissioners\u00a0 of appraisal in accordance with the provisions of section 636\u00a0 and following, of the aforementioned code.<br\/><br\/>The indispensable requisite of the registration of a mortgage instrument in the registry of property, is expressly prescribed by the\u00a0 Civil Code\u00a0 in article 1875 thereof, the first paragraph of which\u00a0 reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"Besides the requisites\u00a0 mentioned in article 1857, it\u00a0 is indispensable, in order that the mortgage may be validly constituted, that the instrument by which it is created be entered in the registry of property.\"<\/blockquote>The instrument\u00a0 of debt, Exhibit A,\u00a0 which\u00a0 created the mortgage upon the aforesaid property in favor of the plaintiff, does not appear to be registered in the registry of property, as stated in the judgment appealed from; wherefore it can not be concluded that the said mortgage was validly constituted in accordance\u00a0 with law so as to enable the creditor, by virtue of the said document, to prosecute an action upon a mortgage, a right of action which could not be derived therefrom because of the failure to register the instrument in the registry of property.<br\/><br\/>The other kind of security referred, to in section 708 of the Code of Civil Procedure, can not support the prosecution of the action mentioned, because such security can not be held to be a mortgage, and if there is no mortgage it would be impossible to prosecute\u00a0 the\u00a0 action.\u00a0\u00a0 The proper action may be of a different kind, but it can not be that mortgage action expressly provided by law for the collection of credits secured by a mortgage on real\u00a0 estate.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the incidental issue raised in first instance, relative to the alleged improper admission of the appeal by the approval of the bill of exceptions, since that incidental issue was not raised in this second instance by means of the necessary previous motion, before\u00a0 proceeding further with the appeal, in order that that question might be duly and opportunely decided by this court, it is not possible to pass upon it now, in view\u00a0 of the statements made in the appellee's brief, and at the same time decide the principal issue, on account of the present status of the\u00a0 case in this instance where it is no longer permissible either to raise or to argue such a question, owing to the omission or waiver of the party interested.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, it is proper, in\u00a0 our opinion, to affirm and\u00a0 we\u00a0 do hereby\u00a0 affirm the judgment appealed from, with the costs against the appellant.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

In the room was found also the clothes and registration certificates of the\u00a0 defendant, together with certain articles\u00a0 of feminine apparel.\u00a0\u00a0 The defendant testified that he did not live by himself in the room;\u00a0 that the bed was not his; and\u00a0 that he knew nothing of the pipe\u00a0 or opium which was found there; but he admitted that he lived\u00a0 in the room, and\u00a0 that\u00a0 he rented\u00a0 other rooms\u00a0 in the house\u00a0 to various tenants.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 only error assigned on\u00a0 this appeal which need be considered was the alleged failure of proof that the defendant knew that he had\u00a0 on his premises the opium and opium pipe which were found there by the internal-revenue agents.\u00a0 Section 31\u00a0 of Act No. 1761 is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Any unauthorized\u00a0 person owning,\u00a0 carrying,\u00a0 holding, having, controlling,\u00a0 having\u00a0 possession of,\u00a0 or knowingly having on his premises, any opium, cocaine, alpha or beta eucaine, or any derivative or\u00a0 preparation of such\u00a0 drugs or substances,\u00a0 on and after March first, nineteen\u00a0 hundred and eight, shall be\u00a0 punished by a fine not exceeding ten thousand pesos, or by imprisonment for not exceeding five years, or by both such fine and imprisonment, in the discretion of the court: <i>Provided, however,<\/i> That in the case of the commission of a second offense under the provisions of this section, any person\u00a0 so\u00a0 convicted, if\u00a0 other than\u00a0 a citizen\u00a0 of the United States or a citizen of the Philippine Islands, may, by order of the court,\u00a0 be deported.\"<\/blockquote>It is true, as counsel for appellant insists, that a conviction can\u00a0 not be had under this section unless it affirmatively appears that defendant <i>knowingly<\/i> had the prohibited articles on his\u00a0 premises,\u00a0 or that the animus <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">possidendi<\/span> in fact existed together with his alleged\u00a0 apparent possession or control of such\u00a0 articles,\u00a0 But direct proof of facts of this nature in a criminal proceeding; is\u00a0 rarely forthcoming, except in cases of confession, and their existence may and usually must be inferred from\u00a0 the varying\u00a0 circumstances in each particular case. In the case at bar we are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the circumstances under which the prohibited\u00a0 articles were found justify the inference that they were in the defendant's\u00a0 room\u00a0 with his knowledge, and that they were in his possession and control at the time of his arrest.<br\/><br\/>In\u00a0 the\u00a0 case\u00a0 of The United States\u00a0 <i>vs.<\/i> Tan Tayco\u00a0 (12 Phil.\u00a0 Rep., 739),\u00a0 we acquitted\u00a0 the defendants who were charged with\u00a0 unlawfully having an\u00a0 opium\u00a0 pipe\u00a0 in\u00a0 their possession and control on the ground that the <i>animus possidendi<\/i> did\u00a0 not appear, although the evidence introduced by the prosecution in that case was of a very similar character to the evidence of the prosecution in\u00a0 this case.\u00a0 But it is to be observed that in the former case one of the defendants introduced testimony which furnished \"a full,\u00a0 satisfactory, and sufficient explanation\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 presence of\u00a0 the utensils for smoking opium in his house at the time of their seizure, which is\u00a0 entirely consistent\u00a0 with the allegations\u00a0 of the defendants that those utensils\u00a0 were not\u00a0 at that\u00a0 time in their possession, and therefore, entirely consistent with the innocence\u00a0 of the defendants.\"\u00a0 In the case at bar no explanation\u00a0 was\u00a0 offered of the\u00a0 fact that the opium\u00a0 and the opium pipe were found in the bedroom of the defendant, which would even tend to\u00a0 put in\u00a0 doubt the reasonable\u00a0 inference therefrom, that under all the circumstances these articles were in the possession\u00a0 and control of the defendant, knowingly on his premises, and that as to these articles the <i>animus possidendi<\/i>\u00a0 did\u00a0 in\u00a0 fact exist at the time of his arrest. <br\/><br\/>The judgment\u00a0 of\u00a0 conviction and the sentence imposed upon the appellant should\u00a0 be affirmed, with\u00a0 the costs\u00a0 of this instance against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

The complaint alleges that on or about the 24th\u00a0 day of May,\u00a0 1908,\u00a0 within the jurisdiction of the town of Barili, Province of Cebu,\u00a0 the said defendants, with treachery and known premeditation, wounded Severino Manigos with bolos, causing the instantaneous death of the said\u00a0 Manigos. The Court of First Instance of Cebu found Benito Paraiso and Isidoro\u00a0 Delin guilty\u00a0 as\u00a0 principals of the crime of homicide,\u00a0 and sentenced each of them\u00a0 to seventeen years four months and twenty-one\u00a0 days of <i>reclusion temporal,<\/i> together\u00a0 with the corresponding accessory\u00a0 penalties,\u00a0 and Clemente Delin to eight years of <i>prision mayor<\/i>, as an accomplice, also to the accessory penalties.\u00a0 These defendants were further condemned to indemnify, jointly and severally, the family of the deceased\u00a0 in the sum of P500, and to pay the costs.\u00a0 From this sentence the defendants appealed, but Clemente Delin and Isidoro Delin withdrew their appeals and are now serving the sentence imposed\u00a0 upon them by the court below.<br\/><br\/>The prosecution presented two witnesses, Marcos Campana\u00a0 and Claro\u00a0 Ababa.\u00a0 The defense examined Isidoro Delin and\u00a0 Clemente\u00a0 Delin, two of the\u00a0 accused.\u00a0 Marcos Campana testified that he knew the three accused and the deceased; that the deceased was a very old man who walked by supporting himself with a cane; that between the hours of\u00a0 7\u00a0 and 8\u00a0 o'clock\u00a0 on the\u00a0 night\u00a0 of the\u00a0 24th\u00a0 of May, 1908,\u00a0 in\u00a0 the barrio\u00a0 of\u00a0 Montalangan, in the municipality of Barili, Province of Cebu, he heard the defendants say, when they were a short distance from his house: \"Where is our enemy?\"\u00a0\u00a0 That on hearing this he looked through an opening in the side of his house and saw the three accused, Clemente Delin in front carrying a torchlight, Benito Paraiso about two brazas behind Clemente, Isidoro Delin about one braza behind Paraiso; that these defendants met the old man, Severino Manigos, just in front of his (witness's) house, and on meeting him there Benito Paraiso said: \"You are my enemy,\" then struck\u00a0 him with a bolo; that immediately after the deceased was struck by Paraiso, Isidoro Delin struck the old man with the same\u00a0 kind of weapon; that Manigos fell to the ground and died immediately as a result\u00a0 of\u00a0 these blows;\u00a0 that the defendants then\u00a0 went to the door of the tienda of Claro Ababa, which was just in front and about four brazas distant from his (witness's) house;\u00a0 that\u00a0 the defendants,\u00a0 after leaving the\u00a0 house of Claro Ababa, entered the cockpit which was very near by, looked around inside the same, and then went to the\u00a0 body of the\u00a0 deceased and examined it; that on\u00a0 examination one of them remarked: <i>\"Caramba! <\/i>\u00a0 This is an old man.\" <br\/><br\/>Claro Ababa, the other witness presented by the Government, corroborated in all its material\u00a0 parts the testimony given by Marcos Campana.\u00a0 This witness testified that it was about 10\u00a0 o'clock\u00a0 on that night\u00a0 when Manigos was killed by Benito Paraiso and Isidoro Delin; that when this trouble occurred, just in front of his store, his tienda was open but that he immediately closed the door; that after the defendants had struck the old man twice\u00a0 with their bolos and he having fallen to the ground, they came to the\u00a0 door of his\u00a0 store and began to\u00a0 strike\u00a0 blows on\u00a0 the said\u00a0 door with their bolos; that after leaving his store they entered the cockpit and then returned to the body\u00a0 of the deceased; that he examined the body of the deceased\u00a0 on the following day and saw the two severe wounds, the\u00a0 deceased having been disemboweled by one of said wounds.<br\/><br\/>The two accused, Clemente Delin and Isidoro Delin, presented as witnesses for the defense, testified that they\u00a0 took no part in the killing of Severino Manigos; that they were not there on that night; that they knew absolutely nothing of this killing; and that they did not know, nor were they acquainted with the deceased.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 two witnesses presented by the Government\u00a0 were eyewitnesses to this killing; they were well acquainted with the defendants and deceased before\u00a0 this trouble occurred. On the night in\u00a0 question\u00a0 they\u00a0 had a good opportunity to recognize the defendants, as the killing occurred very close to\u00a0 their houses and\u00a0 under such\u00a0 circumstances\u00a0 that\u00a0 their attention was directed to\u00a0 the identity of\u00a0 the persons who committed the deed.\u00a0\u00a0 It\u00a0 is true that one\u00a0 of these witnesses\u00a0 stated that the killing occurred between 7 and\u00a0 8 o'clock\u00a0 on the night\u00a0 of the\u00a0 24th\u00a0 of\u00a0 May, while the other witness testified that it occurred\u00a0 about 10 o'clock on that night.\u00a0 We are of the opinion that this discrepancy\u00a0 as to the hour\u00a0 is not material.\u00a0 The attention of\u00a0 these witnesses was\u00a0 not called\u00a0 or\u00a0 directed to the\u00a0 hour\u00a0 when this occurred.\u00a0 The principal thing which concerned them\u00a0 at the time was\u00a0 the killing of this\u00a0 old man.\u00a0\u00a0 It is immaterial whether this killing took place between\u00a0 the\u00a0 hours\u00a0 of\u00a0 7 and 8 or at 10 o'clock.\u00a0 This would\u00a0 not\u00a0 change the fact that the deceased\u00a0 was killed at\u00a0 that place on\u00a0 the night of the 24th of May.<br\/><br\/>There can not be the slightest doubt that the deceased died as a direct result of the wounds inflicted by Benito Paraiso and Isidoro Delin\u00a0 on\u00a0 the night of May 24.\u00a0 Either one\u00a0 of these\u00a0 wounds would alone have caused the\u00a0 immediate death of Severino Manigos.\u00a0\u00a0 The deceased was\u00a0 a very decrepit old man, and was\u00a0 walking quietly along\u00a0 the street, aided by his cane, when he was suddenly attacked by these armed defendants.\u00a0\u00a0 He had absolutely no opportunity to either defend himself or make his escape, the attack being sudden and without warning.\u00a0\u00a0 He was,\u00a0 under these circumstances, perfectly defenseless.\u00a0 This appellant and his\u00a0 companions were\u00a0 in\u00a0 no danger whatever of\u00a0 bodily harm when\u00a0 they attacked this\u00a0 old\u00a0 man.\u00a0\u00a0 The fact\u00a0 that the deceased had a cane does not in any manner change\u00a0 the\u00a0 nature of this crime inasmuch\u00a0 as\u00a0 it was\u00a0 necessary for him to use this cane when walking.\u00a0 He was not carrying it for the purpose of\u00a0 defending himself\u00a0 and was not expecting\u00a0 any attack, as\u00a0 there did not exist any reasons whatsoever for him to have the slightest fear or intimation that he was going to be attacked on that night.<br\/><br\/>The complaint in\u00a0 this case charged the defendants with the crime of assassination, in that they,\u00a0 with treachery and known premeditation, caused the death of Severino Manigos by\u00a0 means of bolos.\u00a0 In order to\u00a0 raise this crime\u00a0 from homicide\u00a0 to\u00a0 assassination one of these\u00a0 qualifying circumstances must have\u00a0 been present.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 circumstance of known premeditation did not exist, but we are clearly of the opinion that the qualifying circumstance of treachery (<i>alevosia<\/i>) has been\u00a0 established.<br\/><br\/>No. 2 of article 10 of the Penal Code provides as follows:<br\/><blockquote><center>*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><\/center> <br\/>\"There is treachery\u00a0 when the culprit\u00a0 commits any crime against persons,\u00a0 employing means,\u00a0 methods, or\u00a0 forms in the execution thereof which tend to directly and specially insure it without risk to the person of the criminal arising from the defense the injured party might make,\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In the case at bar, as we have said, the appellant and his two companions\u00a0 were armed with deadly weapons.\u00a0\u00a0 The deceased was a defenseless old man. The attack was sudden, resulting in the instantaneous death of Manigos, without giving him any opportunity to defend himself or make his\u00a0 escape,\u00a0 the\u00a0 culprits thereby\u00a0 employing means in the execution\u00a0 of this crime which insured\u00a0 them\u00a0 against\u00a0 any risk of personal injury from the deceased, Severino Manigos, and treacherously taking the life of the said Manigos.\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Angel, 4 Phil. Rep., 295; U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Canaman, 9 Phil. Rep., 121; U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Matanug, 11 Phil. Rep., 188.) The trial court found that the aggravating circumstance of nocturnity was present in the commission of this crime. Such\u00a0 application, however, can not be made, inasmuch as it has\u00a0 not been shown that\u00a0 the defendants intentionally sought the cover of darkness for the purpose of committing this murder.\u00a0 They were going\u00a0 along the\u00a0 street carrying a light of sufficient brilliance to make it\u00a0 easy for people near by to recognize them.\u00a0\u00a0 (U.

The court further ordered\u00a0 that the said opium discovered be confiscated to the Insular Government, to be\u00a0 delivered to the honorable Collector of Customs, to be disposed of in the manner prescribed by law.<br\/><br\/>From\u00a0 this sentence the defendant appealed to this court and made the following assignments of error:<br\/><br\/>First.\u00a0 The court erred in finding\u00a0 as a fact\u00a0 \"that\u00a0 the customs\u00a0 inspector, with\u00a0 several assistants,\u00a0 authorized to make arrests, went\u00a0 aboard said ship (<i>Rubi<\/i>) and notified the chief officer thereof\u00a0 that they\u00a0 were about to make\u00a0 a search of said ship for contraband goods, and immediately went to the engine room therein for that purpose, and then and there announced in the presence of\u00a0 the defendant that they were about to make said search.\"<br\/><br\/>Second. The\u00a0 court erred\u00a0 in finding from the evidence that \"immediately\" after the entrance of the customs inspector,\u00a0 Betenbaugh, into\u00a0 the\u00a0 engine room, the accused retired therefrom\u00a0 and \"immediately\" went\u00a0 to the bunker where the opium was found.<br\/><br\/>Third. The court erred in\u00a0 finding that the accused was guilty.<br\/><br\/>The defendant was the second engineer on the steamer <i>Rubi<\/i> at the time and on the day when said opium was found on said ship.\u00a0 The contention of the\u00a0 defendant is that in obedience to\u00a0 an order of\u00a0 his\u00a0 superior officer, the\u00a0 chief\u00a0 engineer oi said steamer, he assisted\u00a0 in making a search of said steamer for opium.\u00a0 During said search he\u00a0 found in one of the bunkers of said ship the opium in\u00a0 question, and immediately reported the same to his superior officer.<br\/><br\/>It appears\u00a0 that the customs inspectors had suspicioned that there was opium on the ship, which some person or persons were attempting to bring into the Philippine Islands illegally.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 evidence seems to show beyond\u00a0 question that the defendant, after\u00a0 picking up\u00a0 the said opium in one of the bunkers of the ship, and after giving his superior officer notice,\u00a0 carried the opium to the smoking\u00a0 room of said\u00a0 ship, or was\u00a0 in the act\u00a0 of carrying\u00a0 it to the smoking room, where he supposed the inspectors were, at the time he was arrested.<br\/><br\/>The simple\u00a0 question presented is whether or not the defendant had said opium in his possession, for the purpose of delivering\u00a0 it to the inspectors, having found\u00a0 it, as he alleges, or whether or not he had it in his possession for his own private purposes.<br\/><br\/>If the defendant had the opium in his possession, having found it as he alleges, it\u00a0 would be absurd to convict him under the law, for the reason that he had been ordered by his superior to search the ship for opium. The evident theory of the prosecution is that the defendant was attempting to bring into\u00a0 the Philippine Islands illegally the opium in question; that\u00a0 he had it hidden away,\u00a0 and when he discovered that a search was to be made of the ship, he\u00a0 then went to the place where it was hidden, took it and delivered it to the officers, for the purpose of avoiding discovery and subsequent prosecution.<br\/><br\/>During the\u00a0 trial it was proven that a\u00a0 Chinese\u00a0 tallyman on the said ship, by the name of Wai Kee, had in his\u00a0 possession\u00a0 a\u00a0 permit\u00a0 to buy opium, issued\u00a0 by the Hongkong authorities; that\u00a0 he had actually bought opium from\u00a0 the Hongkong opium farm; that he had tin cans made in Hongkong similar to the cans in question, which were found by the defendant\u00a0 on the ship <i>Rubi;<\/i> that he had had opium on the ship which was delivered\u00a0 to him by a sampan man, for the purpose of bringing it to Manila to sell; that he\u00a0 said he had thrown the same overboard; that he did not know the name\u00a0 of the\u00a0 sampan man who brought the opium\u00a0 to him on\u00a0 board\u00a0 the ship <i>Rubi<\/i>,\u00a0 before the same\u00a0 sailed from Hongkong.\u00a0 His\u00a0 statement that he had\u00a0 thrown the cans overboard; that he did not know the name of the person who brought them to him, in the face of his own statement that he was\u00a0 bringing it\u00a0 to Manila to\u00a0 sell, seems entirely improbable to us and to be untrue.<br\/><br\/>The defendant, at\u00a0 the time he found the opium, apparently made a full and fair statement of how and where he found it.\u00a0\u00a0 The place\u00a0 where the opium was found was used to place cargo and ship's stores and was in charge of the first mate.\u00a0 During the trial of the\u00a0 cause the defendant stated the circumstances\u00a0 under which he\u00a0 found the opium, exactly as he\u00a0 stated them at the time\u00a0 of his arrest.\u00a0 His statements seem\u00a0 to be\u00a0 straightforward\u00a0 and there is no positive proof to contradict them.\u00a0 The strongest evidence against the\u00a0 defendant is a circumstance only.\u00a0 That circumstance is that he found the opium\u00a0 \"too quickly\" after he had been\u00a0 ordered to\u00a0 search the ship\u00a0 for opium.\u00a0\u00a0 The lower court\u00a0 found that the defendant went to the\u00a0 bunker where the opium\u00a0 was found\u00a0 \"immediately\" after being notified that he was to assist in searching\u00a0 the ship.\u00a0\u00a0 The evidence does not show that he went \"immediately\" to the bunker where the opium was found.\u00a0 The\u00a0 evidence does show that the defendant found the\u00a0 opium\u00a0 within\u00a0 a few minutes after the search\u00a0 began.\u00a0 The opium was found in a sack of bran in the corner of said bunker.\u00a0 It seems improbable to us that if the defendant was trying to bring the opium illegally\u00a0 into Manila that he would have put it in a bunker in charge of another officer of\u00a0 the ship.\u00a0\u00a0 The circumstance of the defendant\u00a0 having found the opium within a few\u00a0 minutes after the search for\u00a0 opium began, standing alone, unsupported by any other evidence whatever, taken in connection\u00a0 with the testimony of the witness Wai Kee, is not sufficient, in our opinion, to find the defendant guilty of the\u00a0 crime charged against him,\u00a0 beyond reasonable doubt.\u00a0 This\u00a0 court has held repeatedly that a defendant may be convicted\u00a0 upon circumstantial evidence, but when that is done such evidence must be consistent with and\u00a0 point to the defendant's\u00a0 guilt, beyond a reasonable doubt, and be inconsistent with his innocence.\u00a0\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Reyes, 3 Phil. Rep.,3; U. S.<i> vs.<\/i> Villos, 6 Phil.

BERNARDO GREGORIO AND EUSTAQUIO BALISTOY, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br\/>\n<br\/>\nD E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">Appeals\u00a0 were interposed by\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendants Bernardo Gregorio and Eustaquio Balistoy from the judgment rendered in the two causes prosecuted, No. 1574, against Bernardo Gregorio, and No. 1575, against Eustaquio Balistoy, which were consolidated and in which but one judgment was\u00a0 rendered, and forwarded to this court and registered under No. 5791.<br\/><br\/>In the suit instituted by Pedro Salazar,\u00a0 as a creditor, against\u00a0 Eustaquio Balistoy, in the justice of the peace court of Libog, for the payment of a\u00a0 certain sum of\u00a0 money, judgment was\u00a0 rendered,\u00a0 on April\u00a0 4, 1908, wherein the debtor was sentenced to pay to the plaintiff P275.92,\u00a0 with interest thereon, and the costs.\u00a0 For the\u00a0 execution of the said\u00a0 judgment,\u00a0 two rural properties belonging to the debtor were attached and the 27th of May, 1908, was set as the date for the sale\u00a0 and\u00a0 adjudication\u00a0 of the\u00a0 said attached properties to the highest bidder.\u00a0 On the\u00a0 18th of the\u00a0 same month,\u00a0 Bernardo Gregorio requested the\u00a0 deputy sheriff to exclude\u00a0 the said realty\u00a0 from the attachment, alleging that he was,\u00a0 the owner of the land\u00a0 situated in Tambogon, one of the properties levied upon, 400 <i>brazas<\/i> in circumference, situate in the pueblo of Bacacay, the location and boundaries of which are expressed in his\u00a0 petition, for the\u00a0 reason that he had\u00a0 acquired it by purchase from the\u00a0 judgment debtor, Balistoy, in 1905, prior to the filing\u00a0 of the complaint.\u00a0 By reason\u00a0 of\u00a0 this claim and petition the judgment creditor, Salazar, had to give a\u00a0 bond, in view of which the sheriff proceeded with the sale of the said property, and of another, also attached for the\u00a0 sum of P300, and both\u00a0 were adjudicated to the judgment\u00a0 creditor, according to the certificate, Exhibit C.<br\/><br\/>In order that the\u00a0 claim of intervention presented to the sheriff\u00a0 might prosper, Bernardo Gregorio attached thereto the\u00a0 document Exhibit D, at the end of which and among other particulars appears the memorandum dated in Libog as of February 22, 1905, and signed\u00a0 by Eustaquio Balistoy, Lorenzo Gregorio, and\u00a0 Cirilo Valla,\u00a0 and in which Balistoy states\u00a0 that\u00a0 he bought\u00a0 the\u00a0 land referred to in the said document from Luis Balistoy and sold it to Bernardo Gregorio for P300, wherefore he signed as such vendor. The\u00a0 charge\u00a0 consists in that Balistoy,\u00a0 with intent to injure\u00a0 his creditor, Pedro Salazar, and for the purpose of avoiding the attachment and sale of one of the properties belonging to him,\u00a0 to secure the payment\u00a0 of the judgment obtained by his creditor in the aforementioned suit,\u00a0 did, with disregard of\u00a0 the truth in the narration of the facts, execute or write the said memorandum whereby,\u00a0 on February\u00a0 25, 1905, he made\u00a0 or simulated a conveyance of one of the attached properties in favor of the said Bernardo Gregorio, according to the aforesaid copy,\u00a0 when in fact the said memorandum was written in April, 1908.<br\/><br\/>For\u00a0 the foregoing reasons a complaint was filed in each of the\u00a0 two aforesaid causes\u00a0 in the Court of First Instance of Albay,\u00a0 charging each of the defendants with the crime of the\u00a0 falsification of a private document, and proceedings having been instituted\u00a0 in both causes, which were\u00a0 afterwards, by agreement of the parties thereto, consolidated, the court, on November 6, 1909, pronounced in both of them the judgment appealed from, written in duplicate, whereby Balistoy was sentenced to the penalty of one year eight months and\u00a0 twenty-one days of <i>presidio correccional<\/i>, to the accessory\u00a0 penalties,\u00a0 to\u00a0 pay a fine\u00a0 of\u00a0 1,501 pesetas, and, in case of nonpayment thereof through insolvency, to suffer the\u00a0 corresponding subsidiary\u00a0 imprisonment; provided\u00a0 it should\u00a0 not exceed\u00a0 one-third of the principal sentence,\u00a0 and to pay\u00a0 the costs incurred in cause No. 1575; and likewise, Bernardo\u00a0 Gregorio was sentenced to the\u00a0 penalty of three months and\u00a0 eleven days of <i>arresto mayor,<\/i>\u00a0 to pay a fine of 1,980 pesetas, and, in case of insolvency, to the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment, with the provision that it should not exceed\u00a0 one-third of the principal penalty, to the accessory punishments, and to pay the\u00a0 costs\u00a0 occasioned by cause\u00a0 No.\u00a0 1574.\u00a0\u00a0 From these sentences\u00a0\u00a0 the defendants, respectively, appealed.<br\/><br\/>This\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 case concerns the falsity of a document alleged to have been written on a date prior to the one when it actually was prepared,\u00a0 which instrument\u00a0 simulates the sale\u00a0 of\u00a0 a parcel of land by its owner to a third party, with the intent to defraud the creditor who, through proper judicial process, solicited and obtained the attachment and sale of the said property in order, with the proceeds of such sale, to recover the amount which the owner of the land owed him.<br\/><br\/>The sale was recorded in a memorandum,\u00a0 made\u00a0 upon\u00a0 a private document, according to the\u00a0 alleged copy of the latter presented at trial which belonged to the owner of the land; and, notwithstanding the fact that the sheriff, who carried out the proceedings of attachment\u00a0 and sale,\u00a0 testified to his having seen the original of the said\u00a0 document, or at least the original memorandum of the conveyance, the only record that could be of use to the intervener, who claimed a lien on the\u00a0 land which\u00a0 was\u00a0 to be sold at public auction; certainly the 'mere\u00a0 exhibition of\u00a0 a copy of an unauthenticated private document could not legally produce the effect of suspending the sale of the said land, inasmuch as\u00a0 such copy is not\u00a0 sufficient proof of the right of the intervener and opponent, being a\u00a0 mere copy of a private document whose legality has not been proven.<br\/><br\/>In the charge filed in this\u00a0 cause against the\u00a0 vendor and the vendee of the land\u00a0 in question, it is stated that these parties, the defendants, simulated the\u00a0 said memorandum of sale or conveyance of the land with the intent to injure the creditor, Pedro\u00a0 Salazar; but as the original document, setting\u00a0 forth the said\u00a0 memorandum,\u00a0 was not presented, but merely\u00a0 a copy\u00a0 thereof,\u00a0 and furthermore,\u00a0 as it could not be ascertained who had\u00a0 the original of the document containing the memorandum in\u00a0 question, nor the exact date when the\u00a0 latter was written; the said memorandum, presumed to be simulated and false,\u00a0 was not\u00a0 literally\u00a0 compared by the sheriff who testified\u00a0 that he\u00a0 had seen its original for but a few moments, nor by any officer authorized by law to\u00a0 certify to documents and proceedings\u00a0 such as are recorded in notarial\u00a0 instruments, nor even\u00a0 by two witnesses who might afterwards have been able to testify before the court that the copy exhibited was in exact agreement\u00a0 with\u00a0 its original; therefore, on account of these deficiencies, doubt arises as to whether the original of the document,\u00a0 Exhibit\u00a0 D,\u00a0 really existed at all, and whether the memorandum\u00a0 at the foot\u00a0 of the said exhibit is\u00a0 an exact\u00a0 copy of that alleged to have been written at the end of the said\u00a0 original document.<br\/><br\/>In criminal proceedings for the falsification of a document, it\u00a0 is indispensable that the judges\u00a0 and courts have before them the document alleged to have been simulated, counterfeited, or falsified,\u00a0 in order\u00a0 that\u00a0 they may find, pursuant to the evidence produced in the cause, whether or not the\u00a0 crime of\u00a0 falsification was committed, and also, at the same time, to enable\u00a0 them to determine the degree of each defendant's liability\u00a0 in the falsification\u00a0 under prosecution.\u00a0 Through the lack\u00a0 of the original document containing the memorandum alleged to be false, it\u00a0 is improper to hold, with only a copy of the\u00a0 said original in view, that the crime prosecuted was committed; and although, judging from\u00a0 the testimony\u00a0 of the witnesses who were examined in the two\u00a0 consolidated causes, there is reason to entertain much\u00a0 doubt as to the defendants'\u00a0 innocence, yet,\u00a0 withal, this case does\u00a0 not\u00a0 furnish\u00a0 decisive and\u00a0 conclusive proof of their respective guilt as co-principals of the crime charged. Defendants in a criminal cause are always presumed\u00a0 to be innocent\u00a0 until their guilt be fully proven, and, in\u00a0 case of reasonable\u00a0 doubt and when their guilt is not satisfactorily shown, they\u00a0 are entitled to a judgment of acquittal.\u00a0 In view\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 evidence produced\u00a0 in berth of the aforesaid criminal causes, said causes can only be terminated by such a finding.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, it\u00a0 is proper, in our opinion, with a reversal of the judgment appealed from, to acquit, and we hereby do acquit Eustaquio Balistoy and Bernardo Gregorio, with the costs of both\u00a0 instances\u00a0 <i>de oftcio.<\/i>\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

president of Tacloban, in behalf of his municipality, presented a written application in the Court of Land Registration, soliciting the registration of a parcel\u00a0 of land, of\u00a0 which the\u00a0 said municipality is the absolute\u00a0 owner according to the\u00a0 Land Registration\u00a0 Act, situated\u00a0 in the town proper of Tacloban and bounded\u00a0 on the north by\u00a0 Calle\u00a0 Gran Capitan, on the south by\u00a0 Calle San Roque, on the east by Calle San Juan, and on the west by the lands of\u00a0 Juliana Daylo and Norberto\u00a0 Romualdez, containing\" 4,055.91\u00a0 square meters\u00a0 and whose description, metes, and bounds are set forth in\u00a0 the plan accompanying the application.\u00a0\u00a0 It was represented that the said property was appraised at\u00a0 the last assessment, levied for the purpose of the payment\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 land\u00a0 tax,\u00a0 at\u00a0 $811 United States currency, and\u00a0 the buildings at $11,250 United\u00a0 States currency; that the said land was acquired at a very remote date as a grift from various landowners who were then residents of the pueblo of Tacloban; that there was no encumbrance of any kind on the property, and no person other than the applicant who had any right or interest therein; that the land was occupied by three\u00a0 buildings of strong\u00a0 materials; two primary public schools and the municipal building, now occupied by the provincial high school of Leyte; and\u00a0 that, in the improbable event\u00a0 of the\u00a0 said application not being in accordance with the Land Registration Act, the benefits provided in chapter\u00a0 6 of Act No.\u00a0 926 would be invoked, inasmuch as the municipality had been in possession of the land since time\u00a0 immemorial, and for\u00a0 seventy years\u00a0 past, more or less, had\u00a0 used it for building purposes, the property being inclosed on\u00a0 all\u00a0 sides by a board and bamboo fence.<br\/><br\/>In consequence\u00a0 of the summons and publications made by the Court of Land Registration, the Attorney-General, in behalf of the Director of Lands, opposed the registration applied for' and alleged that the land in question belonged to the Government of the United States and was under the control of the Government of the Philippine Islands, and asked that the said application be denied.<br\/><br\/>The case was heard on January 18, 1909, and testimony having been produced by\u00a0 both parties, the court,\u00a0 in view of the findings reached\u00a0 thereby and on the same\u00a0 date,\u00a0 rendered judgment by decreeing the adjudication and registration of the land described in the application and plan presented, which were attached to the record, a general default first\u00a0 having been ordered to be\u00a0 recorded in accordance with the provisions of Act No. 496.\u00a0 The Solicitor-General excepted to this judgment and moved for a new hearing on the grounds that the findings of fact\u00a0 of the court were contrary to the weight of the evidence, that the evidence did not sufficiently warrant the judgment, and that the latter was contrary to law; and the proper bill of exceptions being presented,\u00a0 it was certified and forwarded to the clerk of this court.<br\/><br\/>As the decision rendered by this court\u00a0 in case No. 5631,<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> originating in\u00a0 the Court of Land Registration and brought before us on appeal by the Attorney-General in representation of the Director of Lands, refers to the inscription in the Court of\u00a0 Land Registration of a\u00a0 parcel of\u00a0 land\u00a0 situated within the town of Catbalogan, the capital of the Province and Island of Samar, which land had been and was occupied by the court-house or municipal building of the said pueblo, so likewise the present decision concerns\u00a0 the inscription in the Court of Land Registration of a parcel of land situated within the town of\u00a0 Tacloban,\u00a0 the capital of the adjoining Province and\u00a0\u00a0 Island of Leyte, which\u00a0 land is at present occupied by three buildings of strong materials and serve, two of them, as primary schools for both sexes, and the other as the courthouse or municipal building of the said pueblo and a part of\u00a0 which is devoted to the use of the provincial high school.<br\/><br\/>The question submitted to this court for decision,\u00a0 through the appeal by the Attorney-General in representation of the Director of Lands, is whether\u00a0 the lot, at present occupied by two public school buildings and the municipal building of Tacloban and also used\u00a0 as\u00a0 quarters for the provincial high school, belongs to\u00a0 the said municipality,\u00a0 or is public Government land\u00a0 under the control\u00a0 of the Government of these\u00a0 Islands.<br\/><br\/>Whereas the land in litigation\u00a0 is\u00a0 now\u00a0 occupied by the court-house or municipal building of Tacloban, the capital of Leyte, and in order to\u00a0 avoid annoying repetitions, the relevant part of the decision rendered in case No. 5631, concerning the registration of land occupied by\u00a0 the municipal building or court-house of the pueblo of Catbalogan, the capital of Samar, is herein reproduced and is of the following purport (219-221):<br\/><br\/>\"In order to obtain\u00a0 a better understanding\u00a0 of the final conclusion\u00a0 to be established in this decision, it is meet to state: That for the\u00a0 purpose of the establishment of new pueblos in this archipelago, at the beginning of its occupation by the Spaniards, an endeavor was always made to find, in favorable places, a certain number of inhabitants and, later, near the pueblos already\u00a0 established, barrios, which ordinarily served as\u00a0 a basis for the formation\u00a0 of other new pueblos that became\u00a0 as populated as the centers on which they were dependent.<br\/><blockquote>\"The\u00a0 executive authorities and other officials who then represented the Spanish Government in these Islands were obliged to adjust their procedure,\u00a0 in the fulfillment of their duties, with regard to the establishment and\u00a0 laying out of new towns, to the Laws of the Indies which determined the course that they were to pursue for such purposes, as may be seen by the following:<br\/><br\/>\"Law 6, title 5, book\u00a0 4, of the Recompilation of the Laws of the Indies, provides,\u00a0 among other things:<br\/><br\/>\" 'That within the\u00a0 boundaries which may be assigned to it, there must be at least thirty residents and each\u00a0 one of them must have a house, etc.'<br\/><br\/>\"Law 7 of the same title and book contains this provision:<br\/><br\/>\" 'Whoever wishes to\u00a0 undertake to establish a new town in the manner provided for, of not more than thirty nor less than ten residents, shall be granted the time\u00a0 and territory necessary for the purpose and under the same conditions.'<br\/><br\/>\"It may be affirmed that years afterwards all the modern pueblos of\u00a0 the\u00a0 archipelago were formed by taking as a basis for their establishment the barrios already populated by a large number of residents who, under the agreement to build the church of the new pueblo, the court-house and afterwards the schoolhouse, obtained from the General Government the administrative separation of their barrio from the pueblo on which it depended, in whose territory it was previously comprised.\u00a0 In such cases a procedure analogous to that prescribed by the Laws of the Indies was observed.<br\/><br\/>\"For the establishment, then, of new pueblos, the administrative authority of the province, in representation of the Governor-General, designated the territory for their location and extension and the metes and bounds of the same; and before allotting the lands\u00a0 among the new settlers,\u00a0 a special demarcation was made of the\u00a0 places which were\u00a0 to\u00a0 serve as the public square of the pueblo, for the erection of the church and as sites for the public buildings, among others, the municipal building or the casa real, as well as of the lands which were to constitute the commons, pastures, and propios of the municipality, and the streets and roads which were to intersect the new town were laid out\u00a0 as may be seen by the following laws:<br\/><br\/>\"Law 7, title 7, book 4, of the Recompilation of the Laws of the Indies, provides:<br\/><br\/>\" 'The district or territory to be given for settlement by composition shall be allotted in the following manner: There shall first be\u00a0 set apart the portion required for\u00a0 the lots of the pueblo, the exido or public lands, and.pastures amply sufficient for the stock which the residents may have, and <i>as much more as propios del lugar, or common lands of the locality<\/i>; the\u00a0 rest\u00a0 of. the territory\u00a0 and district\u00a0 shall\u00a0 be divided into four parts - one of them, of his choice, shall be for him who takes upon\u00a0 himself the\u00a0 obligation to found the pueblo, and the other three parts shall be apportioned equally among the settlers.'<br\/><br\/>\"Law 8,\u00a0 of the same title and\u00a0 book,\u00a0 prescribes, among other things:<br\/><br\/>\" 'That between the main square and the church there shall be constructed the casas reales or municipal buildings, the <i>cabildo, concejo,<\/i> customs buildings, etc.'<br\/><br\/>\"Law 14 of the said\u00a0 title and book also\u00a0 directs among other things:<br\/><br\/>\" That the viceroys shall have set aside such lands as to them appear suitable as\u00a0 the common lands (propios) of the pueblos that have none,\u00a0 therewith to assist in the payment of the salaries of the corregidores and sufficient public lands (<i>exidos<\/i>) and pasture lands as provided for and prescribed by law.'<br\/><br\/>\"Law 1, title 13 of the\u00a0 aforesaid book, provides the following:<br\/><br\/>\" 'Such viceroys and governors as have due authority shall designate to each villa and lugar newly founded and settled the lands and lots which they may need and may be given to them, without\u00a0 detriment to a third party,\u00a0 as\u00a0 propios, and a statement shall be sent to us of what was designated and given\u00a0 to each, in order that we may have\u00a0 such action approved.'\" <\/blockquote>The pueblo and municipality of Tacloban,\u00a0 as the capital of the Island and Province of Leyte, must have been one of the first of the pueblos established and\u00a0 of which\u00a0 the said province is composed and there being no record\u00a0 that its casa real or municipal court-house was erected on any other or different land, it is to be presumed that, on founding that pueblo and on the competent\u00a0 authority proceeding, to designate and demarcate the area of land to be occupied as a site and for the future extension of the town of Tacloban, with its square, streets, and lots for the temple and other public\u00a0 buildings, the lot in\u00a0 question was also designated for the court-house, in accordance with the laws herein before mentioned, and in fact the municipal building was erected thereon very long ago, more than\u00a0 thirty years, according to the witnesses examined,\u00a0 and the municipal president, the applicant, averred that the pueblo of Tacloban had acquired the said lot by donation and had possessed it since time immemorial.\u00a0 It is also to be presumed that the adjudication of the said land in\u00a0 favor of the municipality to enable it to build\u00a0 its court-house thereon, was duly confirmed by the Spanish Government, as must be inferred, without proof to the contrary, in view of\u00a0 its continuous and\u00a0 peaceable possession for so long a period extending\u00a0 to the present time; nor does the record show that any other lot or different parcel\u00a0 of land was adjudicated to it,\u00a0 inasmuch as it\u00a0 was necessary\u00a0 and absolutely indispensable that every pueblo established should have its own casa real or court-house, the seat of its local authority, and also a church where its inhabitants might worship God.<br\/><br\/>For the same reason, other paragraphs of the said decision are quoted here below and are as follows (pp. 222-224):<br\/><blockquote>\"It\u00a0 is to be noted that, in former times, the court-house buildings of\u00a0 the pueblos were called\u00a0 <i>casas reales<\/i> (royal buildings),\u00a0 undoubtedly for the purpose of giving greater dignity to the principle of authority represented in them and inculcating respect among the inhabitants\u00a0 of the pueblo toward the building where the first local authority exercised his governmental duties and at the same time administered justice, for the old peddneos\u00a0 or petty\u00a0 mayors, later called <i> capitanes or gobernadorcillos,<\/i> while they had governmental powers, at the same time administered\u00a0 justice as local judges.<br\/><br\/>\"In paragraph 92 of the royal ordinances of February 26, 1768, the following appears, among other things:<br\/><br\/>\" 'And because,\u00a0 while there is a notable excess of pomp in\u00a0 the\u00a0 buildings of the\u00a0 doctrinary ministers and parish priests, there is, on the other hand, great abandonment of the <i>casas reales<\/i> which, as a general rule, are not\u00a0 habitable on account of their inconvenient and ruinous\u00a0 condition, etc., *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 it is ordered that in\u00a0 all the pueblos, and especially in those of the seats of government, the native inhabitants thereof shall erect decent and convenient municipal\u00a0 buildings modeled after the\u00a0 plans to be furnished by the Central Government, and that therein the <i>gobernadorcillos<\/i> shall have their\u00a0 court rooms\u00a0 and their jails\u00a0 for the\u00a0 security of pris- oners, and all leaks and other\u00a0 damages\u00a0 shall\u00a0 be repaired in time in order that, through omission, they may not cause greater detriment and expense.'<br\/><br\/>\"If the inhabitants of a pueblo, at the time of its foundation,\u00a0 were obliged to erect their\u00a0 casa\u00a0 real or municipal building,\u00a0 it is to be\u00a0 supposed that they built\u00a0 it on their own ground after a designation of the site had been made by the governmental authority of the province - a designation which had to be made, according to the Laws\u00a0 of the Indies, at the same time with that of the main plaza and of the site to be\u00a0 occupied by the temple or church, which latter building is so necessary and indispensable for every pueblo, as well as the casa real or court-house, since in them, respectively,\u00a0 divine worship is had and the local authorities perform their duties.\u00a0\u00a0 The land designated for\u00a0 the church is considered to belong thereto, and likewise\u00a0 the land intended for the court-house should be deemed to be the property of the pueblo awarded to it for the purposes of the public service of the municipality, since no pueblo was able to exist administratively\u00a0 without\u00a0 having a\u00a0 church of its own and a court-house which should be the seat of its local authority and its municipal government.<br\/><br\/>\"It should\u00a0 be remembered that\u00a0 the court-house and\u00a0 the church of every pueblo were always\u00a0 built, in\u00a0 accordance with the provisions of the Laws of the Indies, on one of the sides of the plaza mayor or\u00a0 main square of the town, when not on the lateral line itself, each building on\u00a0 an opposite side; but\u00a0 the said square occupies nearly always a central site within the territory of the pueblo, with the exception of the frequent case where\u00a0 the town\u00a0 has extended toward only one end\u00a0 or side of the territory, in\u00a0 which event its main square ceased to be in the center of the town.\u00a0\u00a0 However, the said square was never located\u00a0 outside of the inhabited place, as were the common and pasturages.\u00a0\u00a0 (Law\u00a0 13, title 7, book 4, Recompilation of the Laws of the Indies.)\"<\/blockquote>In the\u00a0 document\u00a0 Exhibit\u00a0 B, which\u00a0 is a certified copy of the minutes of the session\u00a0 held by the\u00a0 municipal council and the principal elders of the pueblo of Tacloban on September 23, 1901,\u00a0 it appears to have been recorded, among other things, that the lands belonging to the municipality are the lots where the municipal building\u00a0 and the schoolhouses for both sexes are built and, in front of these con- structions, the public\u00a0 square, on one side of which stands the parochial church.\u00a0 From this description it is\u00a0 inferred that the said municipal\u00a0 building and schoolhouses are situated, together with the\u00a0 square and the church, in a central part of the town of Tacloban,\u00a0 where,\u00a0 in accordance\u00a0 with the express provisions\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 Laws\u00a0 of the Indies,\u00a0 they should have been established, and the said\u00a0 buildings could not have been erected and the plaza mayor\u00a0 or main square located outside the town; therefore it can\u00a0 neither be presumed nor concluded that the land converted into\u00a0 a public square and the lots on which the parochial\u00a0 church and the schoolhouses now stand\u00a0 formed a part\u00a0 of\u00a0 the terreno comunal, exido or public pasturage land of the pueblo before mentioned.<br\/><br\/>The land in\u00a0 controversy\u00a0 belongs to the municipality of Tacloban.<br\/><br\/>Taking into\u00a0 account that neither the court-house\u00a0 of\u00a0 a pueblo nor its\u00a0 schoolhouses were constructed outside the town\u00a0 proper, at a distance from its inhabitants, the existence on the said land of two public schoolhouses, erected a great many years\u00a0 ago\u00a0 and used for\u00a0 purposes of\u00a0 instruction of children of both sexes residing in Tacloban, supports the characterization\u00a0 of the property as being private (<i>bien propio)<\/i>, or part of the municipal assets, which is the status of the aforementioned land,\u00a0 and therefore the lot on which the said municipal building and schoolhouses are\u00a0 built is not a part of an <i>exido, dehesa<\/i> (public pasturage),\u00a0 or <i>terreno comunal<\/i> (common), because such lands could\u00a0 only be\u00a0 situated outside of a town,\u00a0 in accordance with the provisions contained in laws 13 and 14, title 7, and 12 and 14,\u00a0 title 12, book 4, and law 8, title 3, book 6, of the Recompilation of the Laws of the Indies, and in No. 53 of the royal ordinances of February 26,1768.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding the circumstances, not\u00a0 very\u00a0 favorable to instruction, which prevailed at that epoch, 1550, it was provided withal, by the sovereign of Spain, in law 18, title 1, book 6 of the Recompilation before cited, that instruction should be given to the natives by teachers who should teach them the Spanish language.\u00a0\u00a0 Later, in No. 93 of the royal ordinances before referred to, a reminder was given as to compliance with the said Law of the Indies and other old ordinances relative\u00a0 to the establishment in the\u00a0 pueblos of schools under the direction of teachers well versed in the Spanish language,\u00a0 a provision confirmed by royal cedulas of June 11, 1815, and October 20, 1817, which emphasized the need of the\u00a0 establishment of schools for the instruction and education of the boys and girls.<br\/><br\/>By royal cedula\u00a0 of November 14, 1816,\u00a0 especially addressed to the\u00a0 \"Governor, Captain-General of the Philippines,\" the king of Spain prescribed that -<br\/><blockquote>\"For this\u00a0 purpose it is ordered,\u00a0 by the laws and ordinances of the Indies and by various royal cedulas issued for their execution, especially those\u00a0 of January 28,\u00a0 1778, November 5, 1782, and June 7, 1815, that the construction of the said schoolhouses be proceeded with in such\u00a0 pueblos of the Indies where there are\u00a0 none.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 And having again taken this matter into consideration, and desiring to remove the causes\u00a0 which may tend\u00a0 to delay the execution of the orders given, and to facilitate in so far as possible the remedying of the damages complained of by the said delegates, in agreement with the statements made to me by my council of the Indies in the consultation had on January 16 of this\u00a0 year, I hereby authorize you,\u00a0 after obtaining the\u00a0 required and indispensable\u00a0 reports,\u00a0 immediately to provide for the erection and\u00a0 establishment of primary schools\u00a0 in all the pueblos\u00a0 were they may be deemed necessary and\u00a0 proper for the civilization\u00a0 of the Indians.\u00a0\u00a0 You shall endow these institutions with the revenues and excises specified in the\u00a0 said royal cedulas, and in default thereof, with such others as you\u00a0 may deem more opportune and less onerous,\u00a0 acting on the advice\u00a0 of my royal court, which you shall first consult, and you shall report the action taken to my supreme council for its approval, without prejudice, however, to your carrying it into effect.\u00a0 It is my will that you so do.\u00a0 Dated at the palace, November 14, 1816.\u00a0 I, the King.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Finally, the royal decree\u00a0 of\u00a0 December 20, 1863,\u00a0 in\u00a0 its article 7, provides as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"ART. 7.\u00a0 The teachers shall enjoy the salary and other advantages provided for by the regulations.\u00a0\u00a0 The said salary, as well as the establishment of the school, acquisition and preservation of school material and supplies,\u00a0 and the rent of the building where there be no public one for the purpose, shall constitute an obligatory expenditure\u00a0 to\u00a0 be paid out of the respective local appropriation.\"<\/blockquote>So that the\u00a0 existence of schools of learning in the pueblos of these Islands really was a need felt and recognized\u00a0 in those remote\u00a0 times by the\u00a0 sovereign\u00a0 and the\u00a0 governing authorities of this country;\u00a0 and if the schools\u00a0 were, and are, necessary and indispensable for the progress and prosperity of the\u00a0 pueblos,\u00a0 and likewise the temples\u00a0 for divine worship, and the court-houses - the seat of the authorities -\u00a0 for the government and proper administration\u00a0 of\u00a0 a town, it is imperative to recognize that the church, the courthouse and the schoolhouse must have been built on\u00a0 lands comprised within the territory of each pueblo and expressly set aside for\u00a0 the purpose by the superior authority, with whose permission the church, municipal building, and school were\u00a0 erected.\u00a0\u00a0 No\u00a0 one to this date has doubted that the land on which a church is built belongs to the followers\u00a0 of the faith to which it is dedicated, for the reason that if the government of this country\u00a0 had not,\u00a0 in the\u00a0 name of the sovereign, granted\u00a0 the land\u00a0 required for its\u00a0 construction, churches or temples could not have been built at the time of the foundation of the pueblos.\u00a0 For the same reason,\u00a0 it is of course to be presumed that a lot for the court-house and another for a schoolhouse were granted and awarded to the pueblo while in\u00a0 period of establishment, <i>as propios.<\/i> A proof that the grant was so made is in the very fact that the said buildings were erected on those lots without op- position or contradiction on the part of the state, or of the superior authorities, under whose permission\u00a0 the buildings in question were constructed for use as schools and a court-house. There are, in\u00a0 fact, pueblos which are without buildings for a court-house and schools, owing eitheir to their absolute lack\u00a0 of means, negligence on the part of\u00a0 their principal residents or of their municipal councils, or to the central government's\u00a0 having\u00a0 provided\u00a0\u00a0 that\u00a0 the\u00a0 said\u00a0 buildings should be\u00a0 devoted to other uses more suitable to the state, in which latter case the government paid the\u00a0 rental of the urban properties that were used\u00a0 and served as a school-house and\u00a0 as municipal offices.<br\/><br\/>It\u00a0 having\u00a0 been provided in article 3\u00a0 of the said royal decree of December 20, 1863, that there should be at least one school for males and another for females in each pueblo of these Islands, it was prescribed in article 7, preinserted herein,\u00a0 that\u00a0 the\u00a0 salary of the teachers,\u00a0 the establishment of the school, the acquisition and preservation\u00a0 of\u00a0 school material and supplies, and the rental\u00a0 of the building, where there was\u00a0 no public one for the purpose, should\u00a0 constitute an obligatory expenditure to be paid out of the\u00a0 respective local appropriation.\u00a0\u00a0 By this legal, administrative provision it is recognized that in some pueblos there are public-school buildings,\u00a0 as in the case of the pueblo of Tacloban, due to the zeal and\u00a0 patriotism of their principal\u00a0 residents; and it must be concluded that the court-house and the two school-houses aforementioned,\u00a0 together\u00a0 with the land\u00a0 on\u00a0 which they are erected, are, for lack of proof to the contrary, the private property of and belong to\u00a0 the said municipality and form\u00a0 a part of its municipal funds or assets.<br\/><br\/>In technical administrative terms,<i> bienes propios<\/i> are cultivated\u00a0 real\u00a0 properties, pasturages,\u00a0 houses or any other property which a city, village,-or hamlet has for the payment of the public expenses. The administration of this class of property\u00a0 pertained\u00a0 to\u00a0 the\u00a0 municipalities.\u00a0\u00a0 It\u00a0 could\u00a0 be alienated after proper procedure and authorization of the competent superior authorities, in accordance with the administrative laws.<br\/><br\/>It\u00a0 is therefore unquestionable\u00a0 that the assets\u00a0 of\u00a0 each pueblo\u00a0 comprised its <i>bienes propios<\/i> and\u00a0 the\u00a0 revenues\u00a0 or products derived therefrom, and this fact is recognized in the \"ordenanza de intendentes\" of 1786, the forty-seventh article of which reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"The funds which\u00a0 any pueblo may have left over as\u00a0 an annual\u00a0 surplus from the products\u00a0 of its <i>propios<\/i> and its ar- bitrios, after meeting the expenses specified in its own par- ticular\u00a0 ordinance, shall be invested in the purchase of real estate and revenue-bearing investments, so that, having a sufficient income for the payment of its obligations and to aid in defraying\u00a0 its ordinary needs,\u00a0 the excise taxes, which are always a burden\u00a0 to the public, may be abolished; and in case it should have no such taxes, nor annuities to redeem on its propios or common properties, the said surplus shall be applied to promote establishments useful to the pueblo and\u00a0 to\u00a0 its province, any\u00a0 such\u00a0 investment\u00a0 to be previously proposed by the <i>intendentes<\/i> and approved by\u00a0 the\u00a0 <i>junta superior.\"<\/i><\/blockquote>Many years afterwards the royal decree of May 19, 1893, confirmed\u00a0 the old legislation by\u00a0 denning, in\u00a0 its twenty-fourth article, the property and revenues which\u00a0 constitute the assets of the\u00a0 pueblos, and which are, among\u00a0 others: A. <i>The\u00a0 revenues and products of\u00a0 urban and rustic properties belonging to the pueblo. <\/i> From this, the conclusion is drawn that the pueblos may have and hold revenue-bearing property of their own, and with all the more reason if the property had by a municipality is dedicated to the public service, as are the buildings and lot possessed under title of ownership by the municipality\u00a0 of Tacloban and which, without any doubt whatever, form a part of\u00a0 its municipal estate\u00a0 or assets, in accordance with the provisions of the said royal decree of May 19, 1893.<br\/><br\/>From the aforementioned decision rendered\u00a0 in case No. 6631, relative to\u00a0 the\u00a0 registration of certain real property belonging to the municipality of Catbalogan, the following quotations are also taken (pp. 225, 226):<br\/><blockquote>\"The said municipality is to-day in possession of the land in litigation, as the owner thereof, under the protection of the civil and administrative laws which guarantee the right of ownership of the corporations that are\u00a0 capable of contracting, acquiring, and possessing real and personal property.<br\/><br\/>\"Article 343 of the Civil Code reads:<br\/><br\/>\"'The property of provinces and of towns is divided into property for public use and patrimonial property.'<br\/><br\/>\"Article 344 of the same code prescribes:<br\/><br\/>\"'Property for public use in provinces and in\u00a0 towns comprises the provincial and town roads, the\u00a0 squares, streets, fountains,\u00a0 and public\u00a0 waters, the promenades, and public works of general service supported\u00a0 by the said towns or provinces.<br\/><br\/>\"All other property possessed by either is patrimonial, and shall be governed by the provisions of\u00a0 this\u00a0 code, unless otherwise prescribed in special laws.'<br\/><br\/>\"Section 2 of Act No. 82, entitled 'A General Act for the organization\u00a0 of municipal governments in the Philippine Islands,' is as follows:<br\/><br\/>\"'Pueblos incorporated under this Act shall be designated as municipalities (municipios), and shall\u00a0 he known respectively by the names heretofore adopted. Under such names they may sue and be sued, contract and be contracted with, acquire and hold real and personal property for the general interests of the municipality, and\u00a0 exercise\u00a0 all the powers hereinafter conferred upon them.<br\/><br\/>\"'All property and property rights vested in any pueblo under its former\u00a0 organization shall\u00a0 continue to be vested in the same municipality after its incorporation under this Act.'<br\/><br\/>\"By this last-cited\u00a0 Act, of an administrative character, the rights of the old municipalities\u00a0 to\u00a0 acquire real and personal property, in accordance with their former organization, are\u00a0 recognized, and it is\u00a0 declared that\u00a0 the said property and rights shall continue to pertain to the municipalities created in harmony with the provisions of the Municipal\u00a0 Code, on account of such\u00a0 property\u00a0 being the patrimonial property of the municipalities.\"<\/blockquote>In accordance with these principles, which harmonize perfectly with both the old and the modern legislation of this country, and taking into consideration the\u00a0 spirit underlying the Law&amp; of\u00a0 the Indies, and the purposes and tendencies of their provisions, ever favorable to the original holders of the land where, under the Spanish sovereignty, new towns were organized,\u00a0 the\u00a0 municipality\u00a0 of\u00a0 Tacloban ought to be considered as\u00a0 the\u00a0 owner of the land on\u00a0 which the municipal building and two schoolhouses,\u00a0 of a public character,\u00a0 were erected, on account of having\u00a0 been awarded to it as\u00a0 its exclusive property,\u00a0 on the\u00a0 founding\u00a0 of\u00a0 the said pueblo, for the record of the case offers\u00a0 no proof nor data whatever contrary to such award or grant. As the said municipality, the applicant, has been occupying the property by its own buildings during such a long space of time, much longer than that required for extraordinary prescription (art. 1959, Civil Code), it can not be denied that the presumption exists, in its favor, that it has been holding the land in its character of owner, since the trial record exhibits no proof that any other parcel of land, distinct from that in\u00a0 controversy, was awarded to the said municipality for\u00a0 the\u00a0 erection thereon of its\u00a0 court-house and schools,\u00a0 a\u00a0 church, schools, and\u00a0 a municipaf\u00a0 building being necessary and indispensable for the normal existence of a\u00a0 regularly constituted pueblo.<br\/><br\/>The title under which the municipality of Tacloban holds and enjoys the land, the registration of which is in question, is the same as that now recognized to\u00a0 exist in favor of the said pueblo in\u00a0 support of its occupancy\u00a0 of\u00a0 the territory within which the\u00a0 town is\u00a0 established\u00a0 with its streets and squares, a\u00a0 title\u00a0 identical with that held at\u00a0 the present time by the church,\u00a0 as a religious institution,\u00a0 to the land now occupied by the temple that exists in the said pueblo.\u00a0 The grant and\u00a0 demarcation of the land to be\u00a0 occupied by the town,\u00a0 as well as the distribution arid allotment of the parcels thereof which\u00a0 were to constitute its squares and streets and of those to be occupied by the church, the municipal and other public buildings, and also of the parcels to be apportioned among its first settlers,\u00a0 must all have been set forth in a record made at the beginning, and that record must have been preserved at least in the archives of the provincial government, since it is improbable that it\u00a0 could have been kept in those of the municipal building, considering the changes wrought by time; wherefore it is not\u00a0 at all strange that the first settlers of a town in formation should lack their respective titles to\u00a0 accredit their ownership to the parcels of land which fell to each of them in the partition made of\u00a0 the lots, for in those\u00a0 remote times fewer records were kept, the archipelago was sparsely populated and\u00a0 there were abundant lands\u00a0 for distribution,\u00a0 for which reasons the mere fact of the erection\u00a0 of a church, the municipal building, and schools, carries with\u00a0 it the presumption that the land\u00a0 on which they are built was allotted to the Church and\u00a0 to the municipality for\u00a0 the public\u00a0 service.\u00a0 No proof whatever was offered at trial against such\u00a0 a presumption, and\u00a0 therefore there exists no legal ground nor\u00a0 equitable reason why the right of the municipality of Tacloban to the land in question ought not to be respected, a right of ownership consecrated by the laws of every civilized country for the benefit of society, of public order,\u00a0 and\u00a0 of\u00a0 civilization itself.<br\/><br\/>In view\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 facts logically and justly supposed and of the legal grounds above\u00a0 noted,\u00a0 it is of course shown that the municipality of Tacloban, as\u00a0 an administrative entity\u00a0 susceptible of rights and duties, has no need to rely upon the right that\u00a0 is\u00a0 derived from prescription in order that it may be held and\u00a0 reputed to be the owner of the land or lot on which buildings belonging to it are erected, for the construction of which\u00a0 the\u00a0 said\u00a0 land was assigned and adjudicated to it when the pueblo was founded, as has been amply proven in\u00a0 the preceding paragraphs.<br\/><br\/>For the purpose of proving that the said land occupied by the court-house and schools of the pueblo of Tacloban, the capital of Leyte, is\u00a0 not comprised\u00a0 within\u00a0 an <i>exido, dehesa, or terreno comunal,<\/i> it behooves us to state that in the initial foundation of\u00a0 a pueblo in these Islands, in accordance\u00a0 with the provisions of the\u00a0 Recompilation of the Laws\u00a0 of\u00a0 the Indies,\u00a0 lands were marked\u00a0 out for it which had an area such as would be inclosed by a perimeter\u00a0 4 <i>leguas<\/i> in length, in the figure permitted by the conditions and circumstances\u00a0 of\u00a0 the place.\u00a0 This measure\u00a0 of\u00a0 area\u00a0 was that adopted also when the undertaking of founding a town in a given place, with the authorization\" of the Government, was intrusted to a private party by virtue of a contract, as when the legitimate representatives of the sovereign<i> motu proprio <\/i>proceeded with the organization of a pueblo in the manner and under the conditions required\u00a0 by the laws in force in that epoch.<br\/><br\/>In either case, on the\u00a0 demarcation\u00a0 of the land to be occupied by the new pueblo and before proceeding to distribute the lots among its settlers, they decided upon the sites for the location of the\u00a0 public square\u00a0 and the streets of\u00a0 the town and the\u00a0 lots on which the temple, the municipal and other public\u00a0 buildings should be constructed, and afterwards\u00a0 they set aside, without the perimeter within which the pueblo was to be situated, a certain area of land which was to constitute the <i>exido, dehesa, or terreno comunal,<\/i> and all in accordance with the Laws of the Indies.\u00a0 So that the square and streets,\u00a0 and\u00a0 the\u00a0 lots\u00a0 to be\u00a0 occupied by\u00a0 the temple, the municipal building, and the\u00a0 schools,\u00a0 could be in no manner situated nor comprised within the <i>terreno comunal, dehesa, or exido<\/i> of a pueblo,\u00a0 inasmuch as the\u00a0 said lots were\u00a0 necessarily within the town, and the latter lands without it.<br\/><br\/>Subsequent provisions of law confirm the foregoing statements, and in this connection the royal decree of February 28,\u00a0 1883, provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"Article 1.\u00a0 The <i>legua comunal<\/i> for the Philippine Islands, under the provisions of Law 8, Title 3, Book 6 of the <i>Recopilacion de Indias<\/i>, so far as the pueblos already established and those which may be established hereafter are concerned, shall be of an area of 20,000 feet, equivalent to a\u00a0 league of 20 degrees, without regard to the geometrical figure resulting from the topography of the locality, or to conditions relating to property rights over the land itself or\u00a0 over land adjoining the same.<br\/><br\/>\"Art.\u00a0 2. The pueblos\u00a0 not having said land allotted to them\u00a0 may apply and obtain the same by means of the corresponding proceedings.<br\/><br\/>\"Art. 3. When the conditions so require, the pueblos may institute proceedings to obtain an extension of said comunal land,\u00a0 in order that the latter\u00a0 may be in keeping with the number of inhabitants, the number of heads of cattle owned by them, and the topographical conditions of each pueblo.\"<\/blockquote>In\u00a0 order to comply with and carry\u00a0 out the said royal decree, the General\u00a0 Government, on the recommendation of the <i>Direccion General de Administracion Civil,<\/i> promulgated among other regulations the following:<br\/><blockquote>\"For\u00a0 the <i>legua comunal<\/i> uncultivated land shall be selected, whenever possible, which may be in proper\u00a0 condition for the pasture of cattle and cultivation of building timber and the necessary industries to meet the requirements of the inhabitants.<br\/><br\/>\"The\u00a0 area of the\u00a0 land having been\u00a0 determined by the General Government, the Bureau of Forestry shall proceed with\u00a0 the designation and\u00a0 the setting\u00a0 of\u00a0 boundary marks of the new comunal land, and a certificate\u00a0 shall be executed in the same form as\u00a0 previously stated.\"<\/blockquote>And in order to clear up any doubts\u00a0 with respect to the fulfillment of the said royal decree of February\u00a0 28, 1883,, it was provided by royal\u00a0 order of January 17, 1885, that - <br\/><blockquote>\"The\u00a0 <i>legua or dehesa<\/i> comunal shall be situated\u00a0 on uncultivated lands within\u00a0 the territorial limits of the pueblo for whose benefit it was intended\u00a0 and shall not comprise lands belonging to\u00a0 the district of another pueblo.\"<\/blockquote>It\u00a0 having\u00a0 been proved\u00a0 in a conclusive\u00a0 manner that the land in\u00a0 litigation is\u00a0 situated within the town of\u00a0 Tacloban and on one side of its public square, it is\u00a0 unquestionable that under no consideration could it be comprised within the pasturage land known as <i>dehesa comunal <\/i>which, if the pueblo of Tacloban\u00a0 had any,\u00a0 would be outside the perimetrical limits of the town, though\u00a0 within its territorial district, among its uncultivated\u00a0 lands; and therefore the said law 8, title 3, book 6, article 53\u00a0 of the Ordinances on Good Government, of\u00a0 February 26, 1768, which treats of the <i>comunal <\/i>lands of\u00a0 the pueblos, and the royal decrees, order, and\u00a0 superior decree\u00a0 before\u00a0 referred\u00a0 to, have no application in the present case, neither\u00a0 does\u00a0 the doctrine established in The City of Manila <i>vs.<\/i> The Insular Government (10 Phil. Rep.,\u00a0 327)\u00a0 apply,\u00a0 inasmuch\u00a0 as the present case does not concern <i>comunal <\/i>land, but a lot owned by the municipality of Tacloban, situated in the town, together with the\" buildings thereon erected, all held\u00a0 by it as property of its own of a patrimonial character, without contradiction or proof of any kind to the contrary.\u00a0\u00a0 It must not be forgotten that the concession and adjudication of lands or lots for the construction of the temple, the municipal building, and the schoolhouses, were made in\u00a0 obedience to a need at the time of\u00a0 the foundation of the pueblo, while the demarcation and concession of<i> comunal <\/i>land or <i>dehesa comunal<\/i> were effected for the convenience of its settlers.<br\/><br\/>We\u00a0 have\u00a0 endeavored to\u00a0 find among the precedents of reported American cases a doctrine opposed to the conclusions herein established, but have found no well-defined one in an\u00a0 analogous case.\u00a0\u00a0 The decision\u00a0 rendered in the\u00a0 suit of The United States<i> vs.<\/i> Santa Fe (165 U. S., 675), involves the right acquired through operation of the law by the city of Santa Fe, to 4 square leagues of land in the immediate vicinity thereof, by virtue of a grant made in fact by the laws of the <i> Recopilacidn de Indias<\/i>, a right which was not recognized as legitimate by the Supreme Court and it therefore reversed the judgment of the lower court with instruc- tions to dismiss the application\u00a0 looking to the establishment of that claim.\u00a0 The case at bar is entirely distinct from that in the case just cited, and therefore the doctrine laid down in the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States is not applicable to this litigation, for the reason that the four leagues of land specified in the Laws of the Indies were those usually assigned to a\u00a0 pueblo, in the demarcation of the site at the beginning of its foundation, as the territory which it might occupy in its subsequent development,\u00a0 but, after the said four leagues had been populated, any unappropriated or uncultivated portion of territory which it should\u00a0 succeed\u00a0 in annexing to\u00a0 its original territory had to be so annexed by virtue of an express grant from the sovereign\u00a0 power as an<i> exido, dehesa, or terreno comunal.<\/i>\u00a0\u00a0 This theory, based entirely on the legal provisions above cited, bears no relation whatever to the case of the segregation of a populated barrio, with its lots and lands of private ownership, from the original pueblo of which it formed a part, and its annexation to another adjoining pueblo,\u00a0 which\u00a0 could only\u00a0 be accomplished through action and\u00a0 decision taken by\u00a0 the General\u00a0 Government,\u00a0 with the approval of the Government of Spain.<br\/><br\/>Moreover, it is likewise to be noted that the municipality of Tacloban, in the exercise of the right of ownership over <i> bienes propios <\/i> exclusively belonging to it, has an independent personality of\u00a0 its own,\u00a0 recognized\u00a0 by law, and\u00a0 does not act, with respect to its patrimonial property, as a mere delegated agent of the central power, without prejudice to the right of inspection established by the administrative laws for the benefit of the pueblo itself and the\u00a0 country in general; wherefore the doctrine established in the case of Aguado <i>vs.<\/i>\u00a0 The City of Manila\u00a0 (9 Phil. Kep.,\u00a0 513) is likewise\u00a0 inapplicable to this litigation,\u00a0 inasmuch as\u00a0 the present case does not concern any contract entered into by the said municipality and a\u00a0 private\u00a0 party, nor\u00a0 administrative acts or\u00a0 proceedings whereby the municipality might be considered as a delegate of the Government.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, and holding that\u00a0 the municipality of Tacloban is the legitimate owner of the land now occupied by its court-house and two public schoolhouses and has a perfect right to have\u00a0 the said land registered in its name in the registry of property, in accordance with law, it is competent, in our opinion, to affirm, as we hereby\u00a0 do, the judgment appealed from, exactly as pronounced by the Court of Land Registration,<br\/><br\/><i> Arellano, C.

That the\u00a0 seven\u00a0 parcels\u00a0 of\u00a0 land\u00a0 described in the complaint\u00a0 of the plaintiff herein are situated as stated\u00a0 in said complaint and are the\u00a0 lands in question.<br\/><br\/>Second.\u00a0 That the said seven parcels\u00a0 of land described\u00a0 in the complaint were the property of Estanislao Amier, now deceased.<br\/><br\/>Third. That the said seven parcels\u00a0 of land in the year 1902 were\u00a0 declared by Escolastico Amier as his property.<br\/><br\/>Fourth.\u00a0 That on\u00a0 the 7th day of May,\u00a0 1903, said seven parcels of\u00a0 land were sold at public sale on account of the territorial\u00a0 tax on\u00a0 the same\u00a0 not having been\u00a0 paid by their owner, Escolastico Amier, or by any other person.<br\/><br\/>Fifth. That on the 7th\u00a0 day\u00a0 of May,\u00a0 1903,\u00a0 Gaudencio Apuya bought said seven\u00a0 parcels of land at the said public sale and received a certificate of sale\u00a0 therefor.<br\/><br\/>Sixth. That said\u00a0 Gaudencio Apuya on the 23d\u00a0 day\u00a0 of June,\u00a0 1903. sold said certificate of sale and all his interest in the same to Rosalia Diasanta, and the latter, on\u00a0 the 5th day of September, 1907, sold all her rights in the said\u00a0 lands to the plaintiff herein, Serafin Belarmino.<br\/><br\/>Seventh. That on the 23d day of August, 1906, Rosalia Diasanta, as\u00a0 assignee of Gaudencio Apuya, received from the provincial treasurer of Albay, in her name, a deed of the said\u00a0 seven parcels of\u00a0 land, the same not having been redeemed by said Escolastico Amier or by any other person.<br\/><br\/>Eighth. That said seven parcels of land were later twice sold at public sale for failure to pay the territorial tax and were each time redeemed by said Rosalia Diasanta.<br\/><br\/>Ninth.

S. McVey,\u00a0 a certificate of tax sale\u00a0 for certain land sold at a tax sale in said Province of Pampanga.<br\/><br\/>\"(2). On\u00a0 the 10th\u00a0 day of August, 1906, the said S. S. McVey, assigned the said certificate of tax sale to the plaintiff herein.<br\/><br\/>\"(3) On\u00a0 the 13th day\u00a0 of September, 1906, the plaintiff herein filed\u00a0 a petition\u00a0 in this court, praying that a writ of mandamus be issued against the defendant herein, as treasurer of said Province of Pampanga, to compel him to issue to the plaintiff a\u00a0 tax\u00a0 deed to the lands described\u00a0 in said certificate of tax sale.<br\/><br\/>\"(4) On\u00a0 the 30th\u00a0 day of October, 1906, the Attorney-General\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 Philippine Islands,\u00a0 representing the\u00a0 said treasurer, filed a demurrer to said petition for mandamus, upon the ground\u00a0 that the complaint\u00a0 did\u00a0 not\u00a0 state\u00a0 facts sufficient to\u00a0 constitute\u00a0 a cause of\u00a0 action, specifically stating the reasons therefor.\u00a0 Said\u00a0 demurrer\u00a0 was.heard by this court on the 12th day\u00a0 of November, 1906.<br\/><br\/>\"The question presented is whether or not the plaintiff is entitled to a writ\u00a0 of\u00a0 mandamus under the\u00a0 provisions of law in force in\u00a0 the Philippine Islands.\u00a0 It is\u00a0 the general rule\u00a0 that a\u00a0 writ of mandamus wiJl not lie against a\u00a0 corporation, board, or officer to compel him\u00a0 or them to perform any specific\u00a0 duty unless such duty is clearly defined by the law or by virtue of an official duty or relation.<br\/><br\/>\"Section 80 of the Municipal Code (Act No. 82) provides:<br\/><br\/>\" 'In case\u00a0 the taxpayer shall not redeem the land sold as above provided within one\u00a0 year from the date of sale, the provincial treasurer, or his deputy, in the name of such treasurer,\u00a0 shall, as grantor, execute a\u00a0 deed\u00a0 in form and effect sufficient\u00a0 under the laws of the Islands to convey to the purchaser so much of the land against which the taxes have been\u00a0 assessed as has been sold, free from all liens of any kind whatsoever, and the\u00a0 deeds shall succinctly\u00a0 recite all the proceedings upon which\u00a0 the validity of\u00a0 the sale depends.'<br\/><br\/>\"It will\u00a0 be noted from the above provision of the said Municipal Code that the treasurer or his deputy shall execute the deed, under the provisions of said Municipal\u00a0 Code, to the <i>purchaser. <\/i>\u00a0 The plaintiff herein is the assignee of the purchaser.\u00a0\u00a0 The law gave to the purchaser at the tax sale alone the right to have the deed executed to him.\u00a0 The law made no provision to have the said tax\u00a0 deed issued to the assignee of\u00a0 the purchaser.\u00a0 This provision\u00a0 of the\u00a0 said Municipal Code\u00a0 seems to have been taken from section 489 of the\u00a0 statutes of the State of\u00a0 Vermont, and the courts of that State have\u00a0 held, together with nearly all the States of the Union,\u00a0 that every statute which provides\u00a0 a method by which\u00a0 a person may be divested\u00a0 of his\u00a0 property\u00a0 under a special authority, must be construed strictly.<br\/><br\/>\"In\u00a0 the\u00a0 case\u00a0 of Thatcher <i>vs. <\/i>Powell\u00a0 (6\u00a0 Wheaton,\u00a0 119, 123) the Supreme Court of the United States\u00a0 said:<br\/><br\/>\" 'That no\u00a0 individual or public officer can sell and convey a good title to the land\u00a0 of another, unless authorized so to do by express law, is one of those self-evident propositions to which the\u00a0 mind assents without hesitation;\u00a0 and that the person invested with such a power must pursue with precision the course prescribed by law,\u00a0 or his\u00a0 act is invalid, is a principle which\u00a0 has been repeatedly recognized in\u00a0 this court.'<br\/><br\/>\"And again, in the case of Alexander <i>vs<\/i>. Savage (90 Ala., 383), the Supreme Court of Alabama held:<br\/><br\/>\" 'A\u00a0 tax deed made to\u00a0 one <i>substituted for the purchaser,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/i> or to any grantee other than the one <i>sanctioned by the statute <\/i>is void.\u00a0\u00a0 The statutory authority to convey must be strictly pursued and the deed made only to\u00a0 those to whom he is authorized by law to execute it.\u00a0\u00a0 (Keen <i>vs<\/i>. Houghton, 19 Maine, 368.)'<br\/><br\/>\"The law in\u00a0 the present case required the defendant to execute the deed to the purchaser under the tax sale.\u00a0 The demurrer is therefore hereby sustained and the plaintiff is hereby\u00a0 given ten\u00a0 days\u00a0 from\u00a0 the\u00a0 notice\u00a0 of this decision within which to amend his complaint, or otherwise the case will be dismissed with costs to the plaintiff.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.\"<\/blockquote><br\/><br\/>By virtue of the authority of the above case, holding that the certificate of sale is\u00a0 not assignable and that a deed to any person other than the purchaser at the sale is void, the judgment of the court below\u00a0 is hereby reversed and the plaintiffs' complaint dismissed, without special finding as to costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

that in consequence of said maltreatment the injured man was rendered unable to work and became seriously ill; that, prostrated in bed and unable to urinate, he was found on the following day, first by two policemen\u00a0 who\u00a0 went to see ,him, and afterwards by the justice of the peace who called at the house; that the said justice of the peace testified that the injured man had the right thumb dislocated, a black swelling\u00a0 on the\u00a0 abdomen, at the navel, a scratch on the right side of the chest, another on the throat, and a contusion in\u00a0 the face; he\u00a0 said that the scratches were,not serious,\u00a0 but that the contusions on the abdomen and chest appeared of doubtful prognosis, all of which details were corroborated\u00a0 by the result of the autopsy; that besides the injured man and his mother-in-law, several\u00a0 eyewitnesses, Fabian Aracan, Miguel Bataen, and Juan\u00a0 Lanag, testified to the truth and reality of\u00a0 said maltreatment,\u00a0 the two last named having testified in the first trial\u00a0 for misdemeanor; that twenty-eight\u00a0 days\u00a0 after the aggression the injured man died on the afternoon of the last day, and the record does not show that his death was due to illness other than that produced by the ill treatment he received.\u00a0\u00a0 All this\u00a0 was shown in the proceedings in\u00a0 said trial (folios 36-40) as well as in the preliminary investigation made\u00a0 by the aforesaid justice of the peace\u00a0 after the 27th of June, following the death of the\u00a0 injured man, by virtue of the complaint filed by his mother-in-law, Maria Condeno, wherein appears the result\u00a0 of the autopsy\u00a0 previously referred to.<br\/><br\/>Hence the culpability of the accused Gabriel Diaz as the sole convicted principal in causing the violent\u00a0 death of Cornelio\u00a0 Alcansaren is evident and\u00a0 unquestionable.\u00a0\u00a0 His exculpatory allegations can in no manner weaken or destroy his own confession\u00a0 to having illtreated the\u00a0 man by giving him only two or three slaps, nor\u00a0 the\u00a0 testimony of various witnesses who saw the defendant punch the deceased, and, with\u00a0 his shoes on, kick him, nor the result\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 post-mortem examination of the body, on which signs of internal injuries were found on the neck, stomach,\u00a0 and lower abdomen.<br\/><br\/>Not the least proof is contained\u00a0 in the record that the injured man\u00a0 died in consequence of disease,\u00a0 and lacking proof to the contrary, it must be presumed that he was in good health on the morning of May 30, 1906, and inasmuch as it. appears from the record that\u00a0 after the ill treatment Alcansaren commenced to\u00a0 suffer pains in various parts of his body, that he could not drink water, swallow any food, urinate, nor much less work,\u00a0 and death\u00a0 came twenty-eight days thereafter, signs of internal injuries being discovered, it follows that\u00a0 Diaz,\u00a0 who illtreated him, is logically responsible for his death, because it has not been proven that Alcansaren lost his life by reason of causes other than the ill treatment that\u00a0 he received.<br\/><br\/>The defense, in order to prevent the prosecution and trial of the case,\u00a0 pleaded that\u00a0 the accused\u00a0 had already\u00a0 been placed in jeopardy, he having been tried,\u00a0 convicted, and sentenced\u00a0 to\u00a0 pay\u00a0 a fine of 50 pesetas\u00a0 and costs by the judgment\u00a0 rendered\u00a0 by\u00a0 the justice\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 peace of San Carlos in the action brought for maltreatment, and as <i>prima facie<\/i> evidence presented the record\u00a0 of the preliminary investigation, at the\u00a0 foot of which the proceedings had in said trial for misdemeanor appear.\u00a0\u00a0 (Folio 45.)<br\/><br\/>As the above plea\u00a0 was\u00a0 overruled,\u00a0 the defendant\u00a0 only offered as evidence at the trial a certified copy of the proceedings at the trial for misdemeanor, which appears attached to the record of the preliminary investigation at folios 36-40, forwarded by the aforesaid justice of the peace to the provincial fiscal of\u00a0 Occidental\u00a0 Negros in view of the fact that the defendant had committed the crime of homicide, and it was the duty of the latter official to have\u00a0 produced the same in the\u00a0 Court of First Instance upon the filing\u00a0 of his complaint for the said crime.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, the record of the preliminary investigation and\u00a0 the\u00a0 proceedings in the trial for misdemeanor were offered in the present case\u00a0 by the defense as evidence that the accused had already been in jeopardy, and subsequently, at the close of the trial, the defense again presented them as such evidence.\u00a0 In view of the repeated presentation of the record of said trial, it was not necessary for the provincial fiscal to offer the said proceedings for a third time as evidence for the prosecution, and he is entitled to avail himself of them to\u00a0 prove the crime and the guilt\u00a0 of the principal, inasmuch\u00a0 as it is a rule of law that a document presented in evidence by one party may likewise be used by the adverse party as evidence for his cause of action.<br\/><br\/>If in the opinion of the defense the copy\u00a0 of the proceedings at the trial prove his plea of jeopardy,\u00a0 and to that end he presented it, together with the proceedings in the preliminary investigation,\u00a0 the contents of both clearly prove the crime\u00a0 and the guilt of the accused. Still\u00a0 further,\u00a0 taking into account merely the result and the merits of the proceedings in the action for misdemeanor, one acquires the fullest conviction, beyond all peradventure of doubt, that Gabriel Diaz inflicted the ill treatment that occasioned the violent death of Cornelio Alcansaren.<br\/><br\/>A calm, careful, and impartial\u00a0 examination of the case discloses the helpless and abandoned condition in which the illtreated man was left in his house, without attendance by a physician or even a <i>curandero <\/i>up to the time of his\u00a0 death; the haste made by the justice of the peace of San Carlos to try the charge for misdemeanor; that of the author of the ill treatment in pleading guilty and complying with the sentence by paying the fine of P10 and costs imposed upon him; and, as the\u00a0 proceedings commenced', the\u00a0 reluctance\u00a0 of the witnesses, most of whom were laborers of the hacienda on which the defendant\u00a0 was employed, to appear and testify in the case, to\u00a0 the extent\u00a0 that at the request of the fiscal an order for the arrest of the witnesses for the prosecution had to be issued, and after being arrested they testified in\u00a0 a manner and\u00a0 in such terms that,\u00a0 as the Attorney-General states in his brief, lead one to presume that the first trial was fraudulently prepared by the\u00a0 accused.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding the fact that the action of the provincial fiscal has been obstructed in this case, in which he\u00a0 should have displayed more zeal in the performance of duties prescribed by the law, and that of the four witnesses offered in the Court of First Instance, Tomas\u00a0 Ferrer, a laborer from the hacienda of Sugbuncogon, said he did not know what was the cause of the death of the injured man, Estanislao Francisco did not remember anything that\u00a0 had occurred and denied\u00a0 having testified before the justice of the peace\u00a0 of San Carlos, although\u00a0 said\u00a0 official\u00a0 contradicted him and averred that the witness Estanislao testified under oath to the declaration that appears in the record of the preliminary investigation; yet, Matias Ferrer, an employee of said hacienda,\u00a0 affirmed\u00a0 that Cornelio died\u00a0 in consequence of the ill treatment he received thereat, although he did not know who inflicted it; and Santos Priano declared in\u00a0 turn\u00a0 that he testified in the preliminary investigation that the injured party had died in consequence of the maltreatment inflicted by Gabriel Diaz, and further stated that,\u00a0 with regard to the other points of\u00a0 his testimony, he\u00a0 heard them\u00a0 from.the deceased while living and from the latter's cousin, Fabian Aracan.\u00a0\u00a0 In spite of the behavior of the witnesses, the sum of this\u00a0 testimony does not favor the accused,\u00a0 but,\u00a0 on the contrary,\u00a0 supports the evidence presented in the proceedings had before the court of the justice of the peace.<br\/><br\/>The plea that the\u00a0 accused had already been\u00a0 placed\u00a0 in jeopardy\u00a0 when\u00a0 charged with and prosecuted for a misdemeanor before the justice of the peace\u00a0 of San Carlos and sentenced to pay a fine is not in accordance with the law, for the reason that the act he was charged with committing constituted\u00a0 a crime, and the said justice of the peace by whom he\u00a0 was improperly tried was incompetent and had no jurisdiction in the\u00a0 case.\u00a0\u00a0 (U. S.\u00a0 <i>vs.<\/i> Ballentine, 4 Phil. Rep., 672;\u00a0 Supreme\u00a0 Court\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 United States in the matter of Grafton, 11\u00a0 Phil. Rep., 776.)<br\/><br\/>The Court of First Instance, when dismissing by its ruling of the 26th of September, 1906, the plea of jeopardy, rightly stated, among other reasons, that \"If it were lawful for a justice of the peace court to try cases of homicide, abuses and arbitrary conduct would then be matters of everday occurance, and in many cases crime would go unpunished, since I consider that in towns where the defendant is an influential resident, collusion would be very possible.<br\/><br\/>Apart from the impropriety of the ple of jeopardy, there appears the fact that, in alleging it, the representative of the defendant practically acknowledged and admitted the facts attributed to him and set out in the complaint as constituting the crime of homicide, the same that was charged by Maria Condeno, the victim's mother-in-law, before the justice of the peace who illegally qualified them as a misdemeanor. The defense has not even tried to show that the alleged facts were false noe has he endeavored to disprove them but, on the contrary, pleaded guilty to the charge of maltreatment.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding the rage and excessive cruelty with which, judging from its fatal consequences, the maltreatment was carried out, it is yet possible to admit that the culprit did not intend to commit an evil so serious as the death of the person (circumstances 3, art.9, Penal Code), but the fact that the injured man failed to work one day in the hacienda because he had been confessed in anticipation of his marriage can not be considered as a cause determining loss of reason and self-control, the seventh circumstance on the said article, on the past of the accused whereby the penalty imposed by the law should be applied in its minimum degree.<br\/><br\/>For the reasons above set forth, in which the errors assigned to the trial court have been refuted, it is our opinion that the judgment appealed from should be reversed, and that Gabriel Dias should be sentenced, as we do hereby sentence him to the penalty of\u00a0 fourteen years of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">re<\/span>c<i>lusion temporal,<\/i> with the accessory penalties of article 59 of the Penal Code, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of P1,000, and to pay the costs of both instances, and it is so ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.J., Mapa, Johnson, Moreland,<\/i> and <i>Elliott, JJ.,<\/i> concur.<br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/><hr align=\"center\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><br\/><center><br\/><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">DISSENTING<\/span><br\/><\/center> <br\/><br\/><b>CARSON, <i>J.<\/i>, <\/b><br\/><br\/>I dissent.<br\/><br\/>In my opinion there is no competent evidence in the record upon which the findings of fact by the trial court should be sustained.<\/div>",

During the struggle that ensued between the two the former, Esteban Montenegro, fired two shots in succession and at point-blank range against the\u00a0 said Ilagan, causing a\u00a0 contused wound in his left forearm and two wounds in the abdomen, which last two, on account of their seriousness, might have caused the death of the\u00a0 person\u00a0 attacked had it not been for the prompt and extraordinary assistance and efforts of the physicians.\u00a0 The accused Esteban Montenegro, with the cooperation of the other accused, Vicente Sison, executed\u00a0 all the acts which would have resulted in the death of Doroteo Ilagan, although, for reasons which are independent of the will of the accused, such result was avoided.\u00a0 All of the foregoing being contrary to law.\"<br\/><br\/>The trial court acquitted both defendants of the crime of frustrated assassination\u00a0 with\u00a0 which they were charged, but convicted\u00a0 Esteban Montenegro of the lesser included crime of frustrated homicide, and sentenced\u00a0 him to eight years and one day of <i>prision mayor,<\/i> together with the accessory penalties prescribed by law,\u00a0 and to\u00a0 the payment of the sum\u00a0 of P500 to the complaining\u00a0 witness\u00a0 as\u00a0 civil damages.<br\/><br\/>On the night of the 19th of April, 1907, Doroteo Ilagan, the complaining witness, and his friend Ramon Castillo, met Esteban Montenegro and his codefendant\u00a0 in this action on the bridge connecting the town of Lemery and the town of Taal, in the Province of Batangas.\u00a0\u00a0 Montenegro called Ilagan aside and charged him with having made offensive remarks about a certain woman, to which Ilagan replied that not only had he never made such remarks, but that he wanted\u00a0 to know the name of the person who had charged him with doing so, in order that he might investigate the matter.\u00a0 Montenegro refused to\u00a0 give the name of the person from whom he had received\u00a0 his information and challenged Ilagan to accompany him to a suitable place for a fight.\u00a0 Ilagan declined to accept the challenge on the ground that he was not ready at\u00a0 that moment, but offered to meet Montenegro on some other occasion.\u00a0 They then separated, but a short time afterwards Ilagan and Castillo again met Montenegro, accompanied by various\u00a0 companions;\u00a0 and on this\u00a0 occasion\u00a0 Montenegro\u00a0 separated\u00a0 himself from his friends,\u00a0 went up to\u00a0 Ilagan and struck him with a\u00a0 club (<i>garrote de palma-brava<\/i>).\u00a0 Ilagan in his turn struck at Montenegro with his stick, which in some way fell from his hand, and then seized Montenegro by the collar (<i>cuello<\/i>) or throat.\u00a0\u00a0 Montenegro on being seized by his opponent threw away his club, drew a revolver from\u00a0 his pocket and fired two shots, one of which\u00a0 took effect in Ilagan's left side, just below the tenth rib, and the other about 4 inches below the left nipple.\u00a0\u00a0 Ilagan was under medical treatment for the wounds thus inflicted\u00a0 for some twenty-eight days, and incurred considerable expenses\u00a0 for medical\u00a0 attendance, nursing, medicine, the amount\u00a0 of which, together with damages, the trial court fixed at P500.<br\/><br\/>The foregoing summary of the facts as found by the trial judge is in\u00a0 our\u00a0 opinion proven by the evidence of record beyond a reasonable doubt, and we find no error in the proceedings in the trial court prejudicial\u00a0 to the rights of the accused.<br\/><br\/>In discussing the\u00a0 allegations in\u00a0 the information as to deliberate premeditation and the intent of the accused, the trial court made use of the following language:<br\/><br\/>\"Had it been the deliberate intention of Esteban to kill Doroteo, he could have easily done\u00a0 so at their first encounter, during which there is no doubt that he was armed j\u00a0 he had then more\u00a0 reason for attacking him,\u00a0 as according to his declaration,\u00a0 Doroteo\u00a0 had said to\u00a0 him that\u00a0 he\u00a0 might do as he pleased with the news circulated with respect to his cousin, a young\u00a0 woman who lived in the house of the accused\u00a0 and whom Doroteo visited.\u00a0 However, when they met for the first time, they agreed to let the question stand for another day, and the accused did not then even attempt to compel him to fight, much less to kill him.<br\/><blockquote>\"The evidence\u00a0 shows that\u00a0 when\u00a0 they separated,\u00a0 and fifteen or twenty minutes after their first encounter, the fight between the two took place, and that Esteban was the first to attack Doroteo with a\u00a0 stick and only used the revolver against Doroteo\u00a0 when\u00a0 the\u00a0 latter\u00a0 held him in his arms to prevent his using the stick.\u00a0\u00a0 If\u00a0 it had been his intention to kill Doroteo, he would not have lost such valuable time in attacking him with the stick, but would have used the revolver as soon as Doroteo arrived at the place where he\u00a0 waited for\u00a0 him.\u00a0 I\u00a0 believe\u00a0 that\u00a0 his intention to kill Doroteo only sprung up when the latter held him in his arms, depriving him of every opportunity to use the stick, and\u00a0 he then feared that he would get the worst of the\u00a0 contest.\u00a0 Treachery\u00a0 is not shown by the fact\u00a0 that, during the progress of a fight, while two men are struggling for the advantage over\u00a0 each other, one of them draws\u00a0 a revolver and\u00a0 fires at the\u00a0 other who is unarmed.<br\/><center><br\/>*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><\/center> <br\/>\"When a man draws a\u00a0 revolver, a deadly weapon the consequences of\u00a0 which are well known, points it at the heart of another and freely and intentionally, although overcome by the loss of self-control, pulls the trigger and fires, his intention, the object of\u00a0 his efforts, can not be said to be unknown; he means to kill.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It is\u00a0 contended that the trial judge\u00a0 erred\u00a0 in his characterization of the offense committed; that the facts proven at the trial and found by\u00a0 the\u00a0 trial judge\u00a0 himself raise\u00a0 a reasonable doubt, not\u00a0 merely as to whether\u00a0 the accused acted with deliberate premeditation but also as to his intention to kill at the\u00a0 moment when he discharged his revolver; and that the\u00a0 intention to kill being an essential element of the crime of attempted\u00a0 homicide, the\u00a0 accused should be acquitted of that crime,\u00a0 and\u00a0 if he\u00a0 be not\u00a0 exempted from punishment on his plea\u00a0 of self-defense, convicted of the complex crime of the unlawful discharge of a firearm at another which resulted in the infliction of <i>lesiones menos graves <\/i>(lesser injuries).<br\/><br\/>In support of this contention our attention is directed to the decision of the supreme court\u00a0 of Spain of the 18th of January, 1887,\u00a0 wherein that court held\u00a0 that\u00a0 \"while\u00a0 it is true\u00a0 that the discharge of a firearm at\u00a0 a short\u00a0 distance, under certain conditions, is,\u00a0 as a general\u00a0 rule,\u00a0 an\u00a0 adequate means for the consummation of the crime of homicide, this fact is not sufficient in itself to demonstrate the homicidal intent of the actor;\" and to\u00a0 its decision of the 12th of December,\u00a0 1884 (with which\u00a0 compare its sentence of November\u00a0 20,\u00a0 1883),\u00a0 wherein it\u00a0 held that proof\u00a0 that certain wounds were inflicted in the trunk of the body of the injured party, as a result of repeated shots fired at a short distance, did not constitute\u00a0 in itself sufficient motive for raising the crime of the unlawful discharge of a\u00a0 deadly weapon at another, accompanied by\u00a0 the infliction of wounds, to the graver crime of frustrated homicide; also to various decisions of this court wherein we have held that \"homicidal intent must be evidenced by acts which at the time of their execution are unmistakably calculated to produce the death of the victim by adequate\u00a0 means;\" and that where an act constitutes in itself a specific crime, defined and penalized by law, such act should not be held to constitute an attempt to commit a higher offense\u00a0 unless\u00a0 the accompanying\u00a0 circumstances\u00a0 marking the execution\u00a0 of the act are such as to preclude beyond a reasonable doubt a finding that the act may have been committed without the intent to commit the higher offense.\u00a0\u00a0 (U. S.<i> vs<\/i>. Taguibao, 1 Phil. Rep., 16; U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Trinidad, 4 Phil. Rep.,\u00a0 152; U.\u00a0 S.<i> vs.<\/i> Camacho, 8 Phil. Rep., 142.)<br\/><br\/>We do not doubt that there may be cases\u00a0 wherein the discharge of a firearm at another is not<i> in\u00a0 itself<\/i> sufficient to sustain a finding of the intention to kill, and there are many cases in the books\u00a0 wherein\u00a0 the attendant circumstances conclusively establish that on discharging a firearm at another the actor was not in fact animated by the intent to kill.\u00a0 But, in\" seeking to ascertain\u00a0 the intention with which a specific act is committed, it is always proper and necessary to look not merely to the act itself but to all the attendant circumstances so far as they are developed by the evidence; and where, as in the case at bar, a revolver is twice discharged point-blank at the\u00a0 body of another, and the shots directed at the most vital parts of the body, it needs but little additional\u00a0 evidence to establish the intent to kill beyond a reasonable doubt.\u00a0 The persistent manner in which the accused in this\u00a0 case forced the fight upon his opponent, and the fact\u00a0 that in\u00a0 seeking his opponent he carried a revolver concealed in his pocket, taken together with the use of the revolver against his unarmed victim, although the presence of onlookers\u00a0 and friends\u00a0 when the fight occurred rendered it wholly improbable that he would or could suffer serious injury at the hands of his\u00a0 opponent, even\u00a0 if the\u00a0 latter were to\u00a0 obtain\u00a0 the mastery, tend to negative the possibility that in twice discharging the revolver and directing his aim\u00a0 point-blank toward the region of the heart and the abdomen of his victim, the accused had any other intention than that\u00a0 of\u00a0 killing\u00a0 his enemy; and in\u00a0 view of all\u00a0 the\u00a0 circumstances,\u00a0 we are unable to conceive of any reasonable\u00a0 hypothesis which would explain the action of the accused other than that when he shot, he shot to kill.<br\/><br\/>We agree with the trial judge that the evidence is not sufficient to establish the existence of deliberate premeditation beyond a reasonable doubt, but we think that there can be no\u00a0 reasonable\u00a0 doubt\u00a0 that,\u00a0 finding himself\u00a0 worsted in the fight with clubs which he himself provoked, the accused there\u00a0 and then resolved to kill and did attempt to kill his enemy.<br\/><br\/>The judgment and sentence of the trial court should he and is\u00a0 hereby affirmed,\u00a0 with\u00a0 the\u00a0 costs of this\u00a0 instance against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Ramon Insierto, the defendant, has testified that in the month of December, 1908 (when the affair happened), he was insane,\u00a0 Is\u00a0 this true?<br\/><blockquote>\"Witness. He suffered\u00a0 from\u00a0 that malady after having been wounded.<br\/><br\/>\"Fiscal. Was he not insane before that?<br\/><br\/>\"Witness. I do not know, but it is true that he was sick.<br\/><br\/>\"Fiscal. What was the nature of his sickness?<br\/><br\/>\"Witness. At first\u00a0 he had pains in the back of the neck and waist.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>For the simple reason that when the child Marcelina was asked how many days she had been ill she replied more than one month, the injuries inflicted by the accused have been classified\u00a0 as\u00a0 graves.\u00a0\u00a0 But upon being asked\u00a0 \"Who cured you?\" she replied: \"We, ourselves;\" that is to say,no medical attendance was required. And, further, it has not been shown whether, as a\u00a0 result, she was unable to\u00a0 attend to her\u00a0 ordinary work.<br\/><br\/>There is reason to question the classification of the wounds as <i>graves<\/i>, made by the trial court, in view of the doctrine established by the\u00a0 decision in cassation of the 23d of December, 1876, to wit, that \"in classifying injuries where the special circumstances\u00a0 of Nos. 1, 2, and 3 of article 431 of the Penal Code are not involved\u00a0 (416 of the Code of the Philippines),\u00a0 the\u00a0 application\u00a0 of\u00a0 the criminal law depends entirely upon the\u00a0 longer or shorter duration of the medical attendance, or of\u00a0 the inability to work in the fields, all of which must be considered in\u00a0 classifying the injuries;\" for this reason the foregoing decision reversed as erroneous the judgment of the lower court\u00a0 classifying a wound that required forty days to heal as a grave injury, notwithstanding the fact that it was evident that\u00a0 the injured party had not needed\u00a0 medical attendance after\u00a0 twelve days and\u00a0 was able to attend to his ordinary work.<br\/><br\/>But admitting as proper the classification of the wounds as <i>graves, <\/i>in\u00a0 accordance with No. 4 of article\u00a0 416 of the Penal Code, the result is that\u00a0 the penalty applicable\u00a0 is that of <i>arresto mayor <\/i>in its maximum degree to <i>prision correccional<\/i> in its minimum degree,\u00a0 to wit, from four months and one day to six months of <i>arresto,<\/i> and from six months and one day to two years and four months of <i>prision correccional.<\/i>\u00a0 Hence, by sentencing the defendant to two years and four\u00a0 months\u00a0 of p<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">rision\u00a0 correctional,<\/span> the court below has applied the extreme penalty; it must therefore have taken into account\u00a0 the two aggravating circumstances which have been considered\u00a0 in\u00a0 its judgment; that of the\u00a0 relationship,\u00a0 and\u00a0 of the age\u00a0 of the injured party.<br\/><br\/>If in\u00a0 the present case it were possible to consider the circumstance of the relationship, the same article 416, by its paragraph 2, raises the penalty for No. 4 to <i>prision correccional <\/i>in its minimum and medium degrees; and this would be the penalty that should be\u00a0 applied,\u00a0 not that imposed by the court below, which is merely the penalty\u00a0 prescribed by paragraph 4 of article 416 in its maximum degree. The fact is that\u00a0 the circumstance of relationship can not be considered, neither as an aggravating circumstance, as stated in the judgment of\u00a0 the court below, nor\u00a0 as a mitigating one as proposed by the Attorney-General\u00a0 in this instance.\u00a0 The relationship which might aggravate or mitigate criminal liability is defined by\u00a0 the first\u00a0 paragraph of article 10 of the Penal Code: \"When the injured person\u00a0 is the spouse, or ascendant, descendant, legitimate, natural, or adopted brother or sister, or relative by affinity in the same degrees of the offender.\"\u00a0 The girl Marcelina Cainela does not come within any of the\u00a0 above degrees of relationship with respect to\u00a0 the defendant, who Is simply her uncle, as she calls him.<br\/><br\/>As to\u00a0 the other aggravating circumstance considered in the judgment and also in\u00a0 the brief of the Attorney-General in this instance, to wit, the insult or contempt for the respect which the injured person deserved on account of her age, there is likewise reason for doubt.\u00a0 It is true that there is always reason for reproach\u00a0 if an outsider should lay his hands on a boy or a girl;\u00a0 but the same act\u00a0 done in order to punish a boy or a girl can not be censured if, for example, it were\u00a0 done by the father\u00a0 or the\u00a0 mother.\u00a0 Punishment, even though it be administered by laying the hands\u00a0 on\u00a0 a child, is\u00a0 not <i>per se<\/i>, a crime, as long as it is reasonable and moderate.\u00a0 Excessive punishment is the kind for which the penal law punishes the father or mother.\u00a0 It is so stated in paragraph 4 of the said article 416:\u00a0 \"The injuries which\u00a0 a father may cause his child in too severe correction are not included in the preceding\u00a0 paragraph\u00a0 (the second paragraph above\u00a0 cited).\"\u00a0\u00a0 Hence, in the case of the\u00a0 father who corrects his child,\u00a0 the circumstances of relationship or age of the child are not\u00a0 considered as modifying for the\u00a0 reason that they are necessarily\u00a0 involved in\u00a0 such\u00a0 a case of excess of correction, which\u00a0 alone is what constitutes the crime of <i>lesiones.<\/i><br\/><br\/>A child who complains of excessive correction received from\u00a0 his father is always a\u00a0 relative\u00a0 and always a\u00a0 minor. The criminal law does not expressly place\u00a0 a teacher in the same\u00a0 position as a father; but on the other hand,\u00a0 when\u00a0 a pupil or a child\u00a0 causes less grave injuries to his teacher or to his father, the law makes the relation\u00a0 of the\u00a0 injured person a reason for\u00a0 increasing the penalty applicable to the\u00a0 offender.<br\/><br\/>By virtue of the foregoing,\u00a0 and inasmuch as it is\u00a0 proper to consider said circumstance as the only one in the case, as was done in the judgment appealed from, it is our opinion that\u00a0 the penalty\u00a0 imposed by\u00a0 paragraph 4\u00a0 of article 416 should be applied in\u00a0 the minimum grade of the\u00a0 maximum degree, reducing the same to one year eight months and one day of <i>prision correccional<\/i>, one-half of the period of detention being credited to the accused.<br\/><br\/>Thus modified the judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed;\u00a0 provided,\u00a0 however, that the\u00a0 penalty of two\u00a0 years and four months\u00a0 imposed therein shall be changed to one year\u00a0 eight months and one day, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa, Johnson,\u00a0 Carson<\/i>, and <i>Moreland, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><\/div>",

The property was believed to be worth about 30,000 pesos. As\u00a0 stated by\u00a0 the widow, the\u00a0 petitioner herein, it\u00a0 seems that the deceased had\u00a0 left a\u00a0 will,\u00a0 and that the nearest relatives were herself and the\u00a0 children and grandchildren of the deceased.<br\/><br\/>On\u00a0 the 11th\u00a0 of the\u00a0 said month of June, 1907, the\u00a0 will and testament of\u00a0 Andres Madrid was\u00a0 presented; therein it appeared that he left a widow, the said Luciana de los Santos, children and\u00a0 grandchildren,\u00a0 and appointed three executors, of whom one died, another, Aniceto Gomez Medel, declined to accept the appointment, and the other,\u00a0 Tomas Madrid, accepted the appointment.\u00a0 The will seems to have been executed on the 14th of November, 1890, in the\u00a0 municipality\u00a0 of Albay, in the presence of Paciano\u00a0 Imperial, a notary public, and the proper number of witnesses, in accordance with the Spanish law which was in force at the time.\u00a0\u00a0 It is alleged, however,\u00a0 without contradiction, that the will had not been\u00a0 legalized\u00a0 (it was\u00a0 presented for this purpose shortly\u00a0 after\u00a0 the\u00a0 intestate proceedings),\u00a0 owing to a legal defect referred to in one of the briefs presented to this court.\u00a0 For this\u00a0 reason\u00a0 the\u00a0 intestate\u00a0 proceedings continued and commissioners were appointed, before whom Aniceto Gomez Medel filed his claim for a\u00a0 credit of 9,000 pesos,\u00a0 Mexican currency, against the estate\u00a0 left by Andres Madrid; this claim was\u00a0 admitted by the\u00a0 commissioners, against whose decision\u00a0 the administrator of the\u00a0 intestate estate of Pedro Avecilla appealed to the court then having jurisdiction of the matter of the succession.<br\/><br\/>As the\u00a0 appeal to the Court of First Instance was perfected, Aniceto Gomez Medel reproduced his complaint and asked that judgment be entered\u00a0 in his favor ordering that the 9,000 pesos be paid him by the intestate\u00a0 estate, with legal interest thereon at the rate of 6 per cent per annum from the 16th of June, 1901, as\u00a0 damages for the delay.<br\/><br\/>The administrator of the intestate estate, in addition to a general denial, set up, as special\u00a0 defense, the statute of limitations.<br\/><br\/>The court below reached the following conclusions: That the only evidence\u00a0 of the claim consists of\u00a0 a document alleged to be the last will or testament of Andres Madrid; that the legalization of the said will was\u00a0 denied by the court; but that the document in itself, as a public instrument executed before a notary, was conclusive\u00a0 evidence that\u00a0 when\u00a0 Andres\u00a0 Madrid, now deceased, executed the same he owed Medel 9,000 pesos; that Andres Madrid\u00a0 so states\u00a0 therein; that\u00a0 the said document is dated December 14, 1890; that Andres Madrid\u00a0 died\u00a0 in June,\u00a0 1901; that by said will the claimant was appointed executor, but until the year 1907 he did not\u00a0 ask\u00a0 for the legalization of the will, and it was\u00a0 during the said year that the widow\u00a0 of Andres Madrid instituted\u00a0 proceedings in connection with the intestate\u00a0 estate\u00a0 of her\u00a0 deceased husband; and that from November,\u00a0 1890, until 1907, to wit, during a period of\u00a0 more than sixteen years, it does not appear that the claimant took any action to enforce his claim.<br\/><br\/>On the strength of these\u00a0 conclusions and of the provision of\u00a0 article 1964 of the Civil\u00a0 Code,\u00a0 which is the only one applicable to the case,\u00a0 supposing the credit to date only from November,\u00a0 1890\u00a0 (date\u00a0 of the public\u00a0 instrument executed by Andres\u00a0 Madrid as his will and testament,\u00a0 in which\u00a0 he acknowledges the debt),\u00a0 the court below found that the action had prescribed by the lapse of fifteen years, which is the period allowed for personal actions according to aforesaid article of the Civil Code.<br\/><br\/>The claimant appealed from\u00a0 the decision and\u00a0 his bill of exceptions having been submitted to this court for the hearing of the appeal, it appears that the following errors have been assigned:<br\/><br\/><ol><li>For not considering the debt of a deceased person as an encumbrance upon the inheritance and\u00a0 a charge upon the property left by him, a debt which should be paid within two years after the making of the partition.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>For considering the period of\u00a0 prescription,\u00a0 which began to run before the death of the debtor, as continuing uninterruptedly after his demise in favor of his heirs, before the inheritance was\u00a0 legally\u00a0 settled\u00a0 and the debt paid\u00a0 or liquidated.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>For considering that,\u00a0 when\u00a0 a debt is acknowledged in a document which is denominated a will, said acknowledgment, is\u00a0 effective from the date of said\u00a0 document, and not from the time of the death of the testator.<\/li><\/ol>The manner in which the court below\u00a0 has considered the validity of the public document, executed by Andres Madrid before a notary\u00a0 and\u00a0 a sufficient number of witnesses, is in accordance with the provisions\u00a0 of the\u00a0 Spanish law which was in force at the time.\u00a0 If it is not\u00a0 valid as a will, owing to the absence of an essential requisite in open wills, such\u00a0 as the\u00a0 specification of the hour at which\u00a0 it was executed, it is valid as a public instrument, for which latter the statement of the\u00a0 hour is not required, and because no other requirement as\u00a0 a\u00a0 public instrument is lacking.<br\/><br\/>If in said\u00a0 public instrument the person executing it,\u00a0 in addition to the clauses constituting\u00a0 his\u00a0 last will as a testator,\u00a0 also enumerates\u00a0 and\u00a0 acknowledges a debt in favor of a third person, the latter\u00a0 has, upon producing the said instrument, a positive proof of his\u00a0 claim;\u00a0 and in such a case what is not valid as a will is valid as a written and authentic evidence of an obligation.<br\/><br\/>The validity of such obligation does not depend upon the date of the death\u00a0 of the testator,\u00a0 which is the time when the will becomes effective, but is reckoned from the actual date when the\u00a0 same was\u00a0 contracted; and when the latter does not appear, as\u00a0 in the present case, it takes effect at least from the date\u00a0 when the written declaration and acknowledgment of its existence was made, and in this manner the\u00a0 court below has\u00a0 computed the existence of the obligation at bar.<br\/><br\/>The date of obligations contained\u00a0 in a\u00a0 will,\u00a0 where the same arise out of purely testamentary provisions by the testator\u00a0 in his will, is reckoned from the time of his death; but\u00a0 if the obligations are hereditary and antedate the will, and\u00a0 are declared and acknowledged in\u00a0 the will as just debts imposed\u00a0 by contract, they do not depend at all on the death of the testator, from\u00a0 which\u00a0 no\u00a0 validity is\u00a0 acquired as happens\u00a0 with the former class of obligations.<br\/><br\/>If the\u00a0 obligation\u00a0 of\u00a0 Andres Madrid for 9,000 pesos in favor of Aniceto Gomez Medel originated at least from the 14th of November, 1890, and the right of personal action which the creditor had against\u00a0 the debtor was not prosecuted until\u00a0 the middle of the year 1907, it is\u00a0 clear that the action prescribed by the lapse of fifteen years, which is the period the\u00a0 law grants for\u00a0 prosecution of personal actions (art. 1964, Civil Code).<br\/><br\/>The ground for the prescription of an\u00a0 action is the inaction or negligence on the part\u00a0 of the creditor who is not solicitous in enforcing his rights.\u00a0 The allegation that, on account of the debtor's\u00a0 death, there is no person to answer the judicial complaint, can not excuse\u00a0 his lack of diligence, it being a well-known fact that the estate itself is a juridical person which continues the\u00a0 rights and obligations of the former owner of the estate,\u00a0 and the representative of the estate itself may be\u00a0 sued by the creditor of the deceased debtor and obliged to respond for debt.<br\/><br\/>It was within the power of the creditor to interrupt the term which was running,\u00a0 by instituting the testamentary succession proceedings\u00a0 after the death of the testator, he being in\u00a0 possession of the will as one of the executors; the whole term for the prescription would not then have elapsed without some action to\u00a0 suspend it, as has happened in this case.<br\/><br\/>Hereditary debts\u00a0 are an\u00a0 incumbrance\u00a0 upon the inheritance, that is, they should be deducted therefrom, because until the money which belongs to another has been deducted there is\u00a0 no inheritance; but the\u00a0 period of\u00a0 prescription\u00a0 is not\u00a0 interrupted\u00a0 until the creditor\u00a0 takes\u00a0 some\u00a0 action\u00a0 to enforce his claim.<br\/><br\/>For the reasons above set forth, the judgment appealed from\u00a0 is\u00a0 hereby\u00a0 affirmed with\u00a0 the\u00a0 costs\u00a0 of this instance against the appellant.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa,\u00a0\u00a0 Johnson,\u00a0 Carson,<\/i>\u00a0 and\u00a0 <i>Moreland,\u00a0 JJ.,<\/i> concur.<br\/><\/div>",

If for such reason the healing of the wounds required longer than if they had been properly treated,\u00a0 the defendant must suffer the\u00a0 consequences thereof, which in\u00a0 reality\u00a0 are no other than the consequences of his own act in inflicting the wounds; and\u00a0 it does not appear, nor is there the least indication that the injured man did anything to retard or to prolong their healing.\u00a0 He who executes\u00a0 an act must respond for all\u00a0 the consequences arising therefrom which can not be imputed to the fault of the injured party.\u00a0 As the injuries above alluded to\u00a0 required more than\u00a0 ninety days to heal, the crime should be classified as graves, not menos graves\u00a0 as erroneously concluded by the court below in the judgment appealed from,\u00a0 and it falls\u00a0 within paragraph\u00a0 3 of article 416 of the Penal Code.<br\/><br\/>It appears from the evidence that the injured party was entirely unable to\u00a0 take any precaution against the\u00a0 aggression of which he was the victim and which resulted in the injuries in question.\u00a0 He was\u00a0 engaged in a friendly conversation with other persons\u00a0 in the house of the defendant when he was suddenly attacked by the latter; not the least trouble,\u00a0 dispute, row, or anything in fact from\u00a0 which\u00a0 an aggression might\u00a0 have been feared or expected preceded the act.\u00a0 It was,\u00a0 owing\u00a0 to\u00a0 the\u00a0 sudden character of the attack, a markedly treacherous act, which brings the present case within the provisions of\u00a0 the last paragraph\u00a0 of said article 416 which, in relation\u00a0 with paragraph 3 of the same article,\u00a0 imposes the penalty\u00a0 of <i>prision correccional<\/i> in\u00a0 its medium and maximum degrees.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is hereby reversed, and the defendant is sentenced to the\u00a0 penalty\u00a0 of\u00a0 three\u00a0 years six months and twenty-one days\u00a0 of <i>prision correccional<\/i>, to pay the sum of P6 to Antonio Castro, president of the municipal board of health, for fees due him for the treatment of the wounds of the injured party,\u00a0 to indemnify the latter in the sum of\u00a0 P25, or\u00a0 to suffer subsidiary imprisonment\u00a0 in case of insolvency\u00a0 at the rate of one\u00a0 day's imprisonment for every twelve and a half pesetas that he fails\u00a0 to pay, with one-half of the period of his detention to be\u00a0 credited to him, and to pay the costs of this instance.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

In the decision rendered the first time and whereby a new trial was ordered, the court said in part what on account of its being here pertinent is transcribed below: <sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup><br\/><blockquote>\"Rosario Darwin Araujo inherited from her mother, Asuncion Araujo y Belen, the hacienda known as Pangpang and other property. She subsequently married Jose Araujo y Celis, the defendant's son, and died on the 22d of January, 1888, leaving no descendants or ascendants, but only collateral relatives, of whom the plaintiffs in this case claim to be the nearest. They consequently alleged that they should succeed to the estate of the said Rosario, and asked that the property inherited by her from her mother be delivered to them as the heirs of the said Rosario. The property in question, according to the complaint, is now held by the defendant, who took possession of the same after the death of her son, Jose Araujo, the husband of the said Rosario, who died a year after the death of his wife - that is to say, in 1889.<br\/><br\/>\"The defendant admits that the property in question belonged privately and exclusively to the wife, Rosario Darwin, but claims that Rosario died leaving a will in which she bequeathed all of her property to her husband, Jose Araujo, and that the latter having died without a will, she, the defendant, succeeded under the law to all of his property, rights, and actions, thereby lawfully acquiring all the property that had formerly belonged to her daughter-in-law, Rosario.\"<\/blockquote>As the court below properly found, the only important and decisive question in this case is whether or not Rosario Darwin executed a legal and valid will in the form and manner alleged by the defendant. If so, the defendant's right to the property would be unquestionable. If not so, the contrary would necessarily be the result.<br\/><br\/>Now, in regard to this point of the execution of the will and the form in which it was executed, the trial judge in the judgment appealed from says as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"I am convinced that Rosario Darwin made her will a short time prior to her death, which occurred in January, 1888, as herein before found. The weight of the evidence shows that the will in question was signed by eight different witnesses, among whom was the plaintiff, Nieves Araujo, who at that time and prior thereto was Rosario Darwin's tutoress.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Rosario's signature was written at her own request and for the reason that she could not sign with her own hand on account of her debility, incident to her sickness, and this was done in the presence of or before Juan Celis, who at that time was the gobernadorcillo of the pueblo of Barotac Nuevo. The place where the will was executed was less than 2 leagues distant from the residence of a notary public duly appointed, Tomas Saenz, who then resided in Pototan. The will, after its execution and according to the best information that can be obtained from the evidence, was sent directly to the Court of First Instance and there was registered, inasmuch as it had been executed before the <i>gobernadorcillo <\/i>who certified to it instead of a notary.<br\/><br\/>\"I am convinced that in the execution of this will this official acted in place of the notary and that the will was approved and registered, of course without calling the witnesses to the will before the court, but merely by an examination of the will to see whether all the formalities had been observed in its execution.\"<\/blockquote>After a careful examination of the evidence, we are of opinion that the findings of fact of the judgment appealed from, just above transcribed, are in accord with the evidence. The fact that the pueblo of Barotac Nuevo, where the will of Nieves Araujo was executed, is less than 2 leagues distant from that of Pototan, the seat of the judicial district of the same name and the official location of the Court of First Instance and also of the notary of the said district during the Spanish regime, appears from the agreement arrived at by the parties at the trial, wherein it is shown that the distance between the town squares or plazas of the two pueblos mentioned is 9,515 meters. This detail of the distance, being one of capital importance in the present question, it is necessary to detefmine the exact meaning of the word <i>legua <\/i>or league, as a linear measure, for the purpose of ascertaining the effects of the laws under the authority of which the will referred to was executed.<br\/><br\/>The distance represented by the said measure has not always been the same.\u00a0\u00a0 According to law 25, title 26, <i>partida<\/i> 2, a <i>legua <\/i>or league contained 3,000 steps; but law 5, title 9, book 9 of the <i>Novisima Recopilacion<\/i>, enacted for the purpose of establishing a uniform system of weights and measures throughout the kingdom of Spain, fixed it definitely at 20,000 feet.<br\/><blockquote>\"In order that the <i>legua<\/i> - this laws says textually - may correspond approximately with what everywhere in Spain has been and is called a legua, which is the distance a person ordinarily walks in one hour, it shall consist of 20,000 feet, and in all cases where the <i>legua<\/i> is concerned, in connection with the royal highways or in the courts or out of them, this shall be its measure.\"<\/blockquote>This provision was the one that governed in the matter at the time of the execution of the will in question. Now, therefore, a meter is equivalent to a little more than 3 Spanish feet and 7 inches; hence 20,000 feet, or a legua, make 5,572 meters, and 2 <i>leguas<\/i>, consequently, 11,144 meters. Therefore the distance that lies between the pueblos of Barotac Nuevo and Pototan is evidently less than 2 <i>leguas<\/i>, since it is only 9,515 meters, according to the agreement had between the parties at the trial.<br\/><br\/>This being established, we believe that the <i>gobernadorcillo<\/i> of Barotac Nuevo lacked the power to legalize in his official capacity, by exercising notarial functions, the will of Rosario Darwin. It is a question of a nuncupative or open will executed in the year 1888. In accordance with laws 1 and 2, title 18, book 10, of the <i>Novisima Recopilacion,<\/i> then in force, such a will could be executed validly in any of the following modes: First, before an escribano or notary and three witnesses, residents of the place where the will is executed; second, without an <i>escribano<\/i>, but with five witnesses of the same neighborhood; third, with only three resident witnesses, when there are not five in the pueblo qualified as residents and there is no <i>escribano<\/i>; and fourth, in the presence of seven witnesses, whether residents or not, although no escribano was present. It was essential in all cases to certify in due form the legality and authenticity of the will in order that it might have full force and effect in law. For this reason, when the <i>escribano<\/i> took no part in the execution of the will and the document therefore lacked the character of a public instrument, its certification was necessary and indispensable by summoning the witnesses before the judge in order that they might in a proper case recognize their respective signatures and testify with regard to the certainty of the execution of the instrument. (Law 4, title 2, <i>partid<\/i>a 6.) This testification was not necessary where the will was executed before an <u>escribano,<\/u> because it then acquired, by the intervention of the said official, the character of a public instrument, which, without need of any other support, was an attestation and full proof in itself. It is to be noted here that, although the extrajudicial public attestation necessary to legalize wills and other public documents was entrusted exclusively to the royal or\" public escribanos by virtue of laws 7 and 8, title 23, book 10, of the <i>Novisima Recopilacion,<\/i> by exception, power was granted to the <i>gobernadorcillos<\/i> of some pueblos of the Philippines to legalize such instruments, owing to the scarcity of escribanos and to the difficulty of communication between the pueblos of the Islands.<br\/><br\/>It clearly appears from the evidence that the will of Rosario Darwin, as executed before the <i>gobernadorcillo<\/i> of Barotac Nuevo, was considered from the very first and on all occasions as a public document, for which reason it was protocoled in the registry of the <i>escribano <\/i>or notary of Pototan, without previous attestation having been made of its due execution in the form provided by law for wills not legalized by a notary or public<i> escribano.<\/i> It is recited in the judgment appealed from, in exact conformity with the evidence:<br\/><blockquote>\"After its execution (the will), * * * was sent directly to the Court of First Instance and there was registered * * * of course without calling the witnesses to the will before the court, but merely by an examination of the will in order to see whether all the formalities had been observed in its execution.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>As the <i>gobernadorcillo<\/i> of Barotac Nuevo did not have the authority to legalize the said will, as hereinabove stated, it is seen that it was completely null as a public document, and that as a private one it was invalid and could not produce any effect in law because it was never properly attested.<br\/><br\/>And the <i>gobernadorcillo<\/i> of Barotac Nuevo lacked the authority to legalize wills for the reason that, as already before stated, this pueblo was less than 2 leguas distant from that of Pototan, at that time the judicial seat of the district to which the pueblo of Barotac Nuevo pertained. The authority granted to the <i>gobernadorcillos <\/i>to legalize public instruments was limited to those of the pueblos that were more than 2 <i>leguas<\/i> distant from their respective seats of government; the others were expressly prohibited from exercising this function. The provision of paragraph 7 of the <i><i>auto acordado<\/i><\/i> of August 31, 1860, approved by royal order of January 18, 1865, is definite in regard to this point. \"The<i> gobernadorcillos<\/i>\" - it says textually - \"of the pueblos that are at a distance of 2 <i>leguas<\/i> or less from their respective seats of government shall <i>abstain from legalizing public instruments\"<\/i> It is true that this prohibition was later, by article 7 of the Notarial Law of 1862, amplified to comprise a distance of 4 <i>leguas,<\/i> and was extended to the Philippines by royal decree of February 15, 1889, the provision of which is here cited only to show the restrictive tendency or spirit that prompted the granting of the power mentioned to the <i>gobernadorcillos <\/i>of certain pueblos; and, indeed, it could not have been otherwise, if we take account of the fact that this concession constituted an exception, and a very special one, to the laws that conferred authority exclusively upon the public<i> escribanos<\/i> or notaries to make extrajudicial public attestations. The said power of the <i>gobernadorcillos<\/i>, being of a peculiarly special character, should be strictly and exactly limited to the express terms of the law, in accordance with which the <i>gobernadorcillo<\/i> of Barotac Nuevo could not validly legalize the will of Rosario Darwin.<br\/><br\/>It is said in the judgment appealed from that the recording of the aforesaid will in the register of the notary of Pototan induces the presumption that it had been executed in conformity with the laws in force on the date of its execution. Supposing this to be true, for the purposes of discussion, such a presumption, <i>juris tantum<\/i> as it is, gives way and must give way before full proof to the contrary, and the evidence adduced at the trial shows, beyond the slightest doubt, that the said will was legalized by a <i>gobernadorcillo<\/i> who absolutely lacked the legal capacity to perform such an act. The subsequent registration of the will could not remedy the nullity.<br\/><br\/>The complaint relates to the hacienda named Pangpang and various other properties specified therein, but in the brief filed in this instance by the appellants they restrict their claim to the said hacienda, all claims relative to such other properties, the. present existence of which certainly does not appear as clearly proved at the trial, being thus apparently abandoned by them. For this reason the decision of this court can only deal with the hacienda mentioned, which must be delivered by the defendant to the plaintiffs inasmuch as, by virtue of the foregoing facts, the defense alleged by the defendant against the said delivery can not be considered in law.<br\/><br\/>The defendant entered into the possession of the Pangpang hacienda with the support of the apparently legal and just title conferred by the will of Rosario Darwin. She was on this account a possessor in good faith and legitimately appropriated the fruits collected from the said hacienda until she was legally interrupted in her possession. (Art. 451, Civil Code.) Such interruption is produced by the summons served upon the possessor to appear at the trial. (Art. 1945 of the same code.) Consequently, the said defendant must return to the plaintiffs the fruits collected from and after that moment; but, as the date when the defendant was judicially summoned does not appear in the bill of exceptions, we fix that of the answer to the complaint as the beginning of the period for the restitution of the fruits collected by her.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

The\u00a0 uncle\u00a0 was lying on the floor in the\u00a0 interior of\u00a0 the shack sick\u00a0 of fever.\u00a0 The deceased, a young man about 20 years of age, was working at something under a <i>manga<\/i> tree a short distance from the shack.\u00a0 Although the accused directed\u00a0 his question to the uncle inside of the shack,\u00a0 the deceased answered the question and pointed out in a general way\u00a0 a portion of the forest near the edge\u00a0 of\u00a0 which\u00a0 stood the shack.\u00a0\u00a0 There is some contradiction between the testimony of the accused\u00a0 and\u00a0 the Government witnesses just at this point.\u00a0 The uncle of the deceased testified that\u00a0 the boy and\u00a0 the accused invited\u00a0 each\u00a0 other\u00a0 mutually to hunt wild chickens and that the accused accepted the invitation. The\u00a0 accused, however, testified that he\u00a0 did not invite\u00a0 the deceased to go hunting with him, neither did the deceased go with\u00a0 him, but that\u00a0 he remained under the manga tree \"tying something.\"\u00a0\u00a0 At any rate the accused went into\u00a0 the forest with his gun.\u00a0 What took place\u00a0 there\u00a0 is unknown to anybody except the accused.\u00a0 Upon that subject he testified as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"And after Feliciano Sanchez pointed out that place to me, that place where the wild chickens\u00a0 were to be found, I proceeded to hunt, because, in the first place, if I\u00a0 could kill some wild chickens\u00a0 we would have\u00a0 something to\u00a0 eat on that day.\u00a0 So when I\u00a0 arrived at that\u00a0 place I saw a wild chicken and I shot him.\u00a0 And after I shot that\u00a0 chicken I heard a\u00a0 human\u00a0 cry.\u00a0 I\u00a0 picked up the\u00a0 chicken and\u00a0 went near the place where I heard the noise, and\u00a0 after I saw that I had wounded a man I went back toward the <i>malecon,<\/i> where\u00a0 my\u00a0 companions were\u00a0 working, running back, and when I arrived there I left my shotgun behind\u00a0 or by a tree not far from where my companions were working; and I called Bernardino Tagampa to tell him about the occurrence, and to him I told of that occurrence because he is my friend and besides that he was a relative of the deceased, and when Tagampa heard\u00a0 of this he and myself went together to see the dead body.\"<\/blockquote>Only one shot was\u00a0 heard that\u00a0 morning and\u00a0 a chicken was killed by a gunshot wound.\u00a0\u00a0 Chicken\u00a0 feathers were found in considerable quantities at the point where\u00a0 the chicken\u00a0 was shot and where the\u00a0 accident occurred.\u00a0 The defendant within a few minutes after the\u00a0 accident went out of the woods to the <i>malecon<\/i>\u00a0 where he had left\u00a0 his laborers at work, carrying the dead chicken with him.\u00a0 The accused\u00a0 called Bernardino Tagampa, one of the laborers, to go with him and they disappeared for some time.\u00a0\u00a0 Tagampa says that they\u00a0 went a little way toward\u00a0 the woods and came back.\u00a0 The\u00a0 accused says that they went to\u00a0 the place where the body\u00a0 of the deceased lay and removed it to a place in the cogon grass where it would not be easily observed.\u00a0 It is certain, however,\u00a0 that the body was concealed in the cogon grass.\u00a0 During the afternoon Tagampa left the <i>malecon,<\/i> where his fellow laborers were working, probably to hunt for a place in which to hide\u00a0 the body. The rest of the laborers saw the witness Yumul take\u00a0 the chicken which had been killed by the accused.\u00a0 He delivered it to the\u00a0 wife of the accused, who testified that she received the chicken from Yumul and that\u00a0 it had been killed by a gunshot\u00a0 wound.\u00a0 That evening the accused\u00a0 and Tagampa went\u00a0 together to dispose\u00a0 of the body finally.\u00a0 They took it from the cogon grass where it lay concealed and carried it about\u00a0 seventeen or\u00a0 eighteen\u00a0 hundred meters\u00a0 from\u00a0 the place\u00a0 where it\u00a0 had originally fallen,\u00a0 and buried it in an old well, covering it with straw and earth\u00a0 and burning straw on top bf the well for the purpose of concealing it. Tagampa said that he helped the\u00a0 accused dispose\u00a0 of\u00a0 the body because he was afraid of him,\u00a0 although he admits that the accused in no way\u00a0 threatened or sought to compel him to do so.\u00a0\u00a0 The defendant prior to the trial denied all knowledge of the death of the deceased or the whereabouts of the body.\u00a0\u00a0 On the trial, however, he confessed his participation in the death of the deceased and told the story substantially as above.<br\/><br\/>So far as can\u00a0 be ascertained from the evidence the prior relations between the accused and the deceased\u00a0 had\u00a0 been normal.\u00a0 The deceased was a tenant on land belonging to a\u00a0 relative\u00a0 of\u00a0 the accused.\u00a0\u00a0 There was no enmity and\u00a0 no unpleasant relations between them. No attempt was made to show any.\u00a0 There appears to have been no motive whatever for the commission of\u00a0 the crime.\u00a0 The\u00a0 Government has not attempted to show any.\u00a0\u00a0 The only possible reason that the\u00a0 accused could have for killing the deceased would be found in the fact of a sudden quarrel between them during the hunt.\u00a0 That idea is wholly negatived by the fact that the\u00a0 chicken and the man were shot at the same time, there having been only one shot fired.<br\/><br\/>Article 1 of the Penal Code says:<br\/><blockquote>\"Crimes or misdemeanors\u00a0 are voluntary acts and omissions punished by law.<br\/><br\/>\"Acts\u00a0 and omissions\u00a0 punished by law\u00a0 are\u00a0 always\u00a0 presumed to be voluntary unless the contrary shall appear.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Article 8, subdivision 8, reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"He who, while performing a legal act with due care, causes some injury by mere accident without\u00a0 liability\u00a0 or intention of causing it.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Section 57 of\u00a0 the Code of Criminal Procedure is as follows :<br\/><blockquote>\"A defendant\u00a0 in a criminal action shall be presumed\u00a0 to be innocent until the contrary is proved, and in case\u00a0 of a reasonable doubt that his guilt is satisfactorily shown\u00a0 he shall be entitled to an acquittal.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The American doctrine is substantially\u00a0 the same.\u00a0 It\u00a0 is uniformly held that if life is taken by misfortune or accident while in the performance of a lawful act executed with due c$re and without intention of\u00a0 doing\u00a0 harm, there is no criminal\u00a0 liability.\u00a0 (Tidwell <i>vs.<\/i>\u00a0 State, 70 Ala., 33; State <i>vs.<\/i> Benham, 23\u00a0 Ia., 154, 92 Am.

I need it because I am\u00a0 sick.\u00a0\u00a0 Send if you can.\u00a0 Eugenio.) This telegram consists of\u00a0 twenty-one words and was transmitted by the telegraph operator\u00a0 Romero in the\u00a0 following form: \"Paniqui, April,\u00a0\u00a0 24-08. - Mariano\u00a0 de la Cruz. -\u00a0 Olongapo.- <i>Mandame dinero pronto, estoy enfermo Eugenio,<\/i>\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Send\u00a0 me\u00a0 money\u00a0 soon, am\u00a0 sick.\u00a0\u00a0 Eugenio.)\u00a0 The original telegram\u00a0 was\u00a0 thus\u00a0 reduced\u00a0 to\u00a0 nine words, and twelve words\u00a0 were\u00a0 omitted.\u00a0 The telegraph\u00a0 operator\u00a0 Romero received for the\u00a0 transmission of the said telegram P1.26, the price charged for\u00a0 the twenty-one words which it contained, and by the reduction gained P0.72, corresponding to the twelve words omitted.<br\/><br\/>The second telegram was originally worded as follows: \"Paniqui, April, 24-08. - Sr. Severino Maguigao. - Los Banos. - <i>Haga el favor de remitir lo que me debe estoy muy enfermo y\u00a0 necesita el\u00a0 dinero<\/i>.\u00a0 - Eugenio.\"\u00a0 (Please remit what you owe me.\u00a0 I am very sick and\u00a0 need the money. Eugenio).\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 operator\u00a0 omitted eight words from\u00a0 this telegram, which was reduced to the following:\u00a0 \"Paniqui, April, 24-08. - Severino\u00a0 Maguigao. -\u00a0 Los Bafios. - <i>Remitame dinero,\u00a0 necesito estoy enfermo<\/i>. - Eugenio\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Remit me money. Need.\u00a0 Am sick.\u00a0\u00a0 Eugenio.)\u00a0 By the\u00a0 reduction of words\u00a0 made, the telegraph operator Joaquin Romero gained the price corresponding to the difference of eight words, to wit, P0.48.<br\/><br\/>On August 24, 1908, the provincial fiscal filed a complaint with\u00a0 the\u00a0 Court of First Instance of Tarlac, based upon the above facts, charging Joaquin Romero with the crime of\u00a0 falsification\u00a0 of telegrams.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 case\u00a0 having come to trial, the judge,\u00a0 in view of the evidence\u00a0 adduced thereat, sentenced the\u00a0 accused, on January 13, 1909, to the penalty of three years\u00a0 and seven months' <i>prision correccional<\/i>, crediting him with one-half of the time he was held as a detention prisoner, to the accessory penalties provided by law,\u00a0 and to the payment\u00a0 of the\u00a0 costs.\u00a0 From\u00a0 this judgment\u00a0 the defendant appealed.<br\/><br\/>From the facts related, which were duly proved\u00a0 in this cause; it is found that\u00a0 the crime of falsification of telegrams sent from\u00a0 the Paniqui station and addressed,\u00a0 one to Mariano de la Cruz residing in Olongapo, and the other to Severino Maguigao residing in the pueblo of Los Banos, La Laguna, was committed, since, with the intent of gain, the number of\u00a0 words\u00a0 contained\u00a0 in\u00a0 each telegram was diminished or reduced and alterations were made therein in such\u00a0 a way as to pervert the truth in the narration of the facts, amd statements\u00a0 different from\u00a0 those contained in the telegrams, delivered at the telegraph station by the sender\u00a0 Eugenio, were\u00a0 transmitted\u00a0 by wire.\u00a0\u00a0 This crime is provided for and punished by article 303 in connection with article 300 of the Penal Code, which article 303 reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"A public official in charge of the telegraph\u00a0 service who shall originate or falsify a telegraphic message shall\u00a0 incur the\u00a0 penalty of <i>prision correccional<\/i> in\u00a0 its medium\u00a0 and maximum\u00a0 degrees.\"<\/blockquote>It is unquestionable, in this cause, that the defendant Joaquin\u00a0 Romero was a\u00a0 public official\u00a0 in\u00a0 charge of the post-office and the telegraph station of the pueblo of Paniqui, Province\u00a0 of Tarlac,\u00a0 was appointed by\u00a0 the\u00a0 Government to discharge the said positions, and as such official received salary from the public treasury.<br\/><br\/>The said defendant is the sole\u00a0 confessed and convicted perpetrator, by direct participation, of the crime mentioned. No motive, other than that of intent of gain, can be ascribed as having determined him to reduce or diminish the number of words\u00a0 contained\u00a0 in\u00a0 each\u00a0 of the telegrams\u00a0 deposited with their cost at the telegraph station\u00a0 under\u00a0 his charge, inasmuch as,\u00a0 by the reduction of the\u00a0 first telegram, addressed to Olongapo, the defendant appropriated to\u00a0 himself\u00a0 P0.72,\u00a0 the cost of the twelve words therein omitted, and\u00a0 in the second\u00a0 telegram he gained\u00a0 P0.48, the amount received for the eight words omitted.\u00a0 The defendant only affixed to the\u00a0 first telegram stamps to the value of P0.54, and\u00a0 to the other stamps to the value of P0.60, while he received P2.34 as the total charge for the twenty-one words of the first telegram and for\u00a0 the eighteen of the second message.<br\/><br\/>It is a fact, admitted by the defendant, that\u00a0 he changed the wording of the telegrams which he received, by omitting several\u00a0 words in\u00a0 each of them; and\u00a0 the\u00a0 record of the cause shows no proof of his\u00a0 allegation that he made an error in\u00a0 recounting the amount received for each one of the telegrams, owing to the number of words they contained, and that he was therefore obliged to diminish the number of words\u00a0 of each of\u00a0 them.\u00a0\u00a0 Such allegation is negatived by the proven facts that he affixed\u00a0 stamps only to\u00a0 the value of\u00a0 P0.54 to one of the telegrams, and of P0.60 to the other, and as he received P2.34 for the dispatch of the two messages, it is\u00a0 evident that the surplus money must have\u00a0 remained\u00a0 in\u00a0 his possession,\u00a0 since,\u00a0 on striking a balance, instead of\u00a0 a surplus it was found that there was a shortage of P3 in the postal funds, as\u00a0 the defendant himself confesses in his\u00a0 official letter of April 25, 1908 (p. 39 of trial record).\u00a0 From all of which it is concluded, as\u00a0 aforesaid, that the defendant obtained profit from\u00a0 the remainder of the sum received by him, equivalent to\u00a0 the price of the\u00a0 words omitted by him from the two telegrams before mentioned.<br\/><br\/>The defendant, therefore, with manifest\u00a0 violation of a prohibitive law perpetrated the\u00a0 unlawful act in question and has thereby incurred\u00a0 the penalty which\u00a0 he merits\u00a0 for his criminal acts.\u00a0 In view of the fact that no mitigating nor aggravating circumstance enters into the\" commission of the crime, the punishment should be imposed upon him in the medium degree of the penalty of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">prision correctional<\/span> in its medium and maximum degrees.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, whereby the errors' attributed to the judgment\u00a0 appealed from\u00a0 have\u00a0 been\u00a0 decided,\u00a0 it is proper, in our\u00a0 opinion, to affirm the\u00a0 said\u00a0 judgment and we hereby affirm the same, with the costs of this instance against the defendant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i> Arellano, C.

The first was a legitimate son.\u00a0\u00a0 It is claimed in this case that the other was\u00a0 illegitimate.\u00a0\u00a0 Whether he was or not we do not now decide.<br\/><br\/>For several years prior to the year 1900 said Gregorio Villarruz and said Ignacio Bellosillo had\u00a0 sustained business relations with each other.\u00a0 Ignacio seems to have had entire charge of the business of Gregorio during that period.\u00a0 In the year\u00a0 1900 Ignacio,\u00a0 being in failing health, found\u00a0 it necessary to go to Manila to be cured of his infirmity.\u00a0\u00a0 Just prior to\u00a0 his departure he went carefully over the book of accounts which he kept showing the relations'between himself and\u00a0 his father and\u00a0 found a\u00a0 balance due from him to his father of P10,102.\u00a0 This balance he duly entered in the book\u00a0 as\u00a0 a part of the\u00a0 account\u00a0 between himself and his father, placed the book in his safe with\u00a0 some other papers and delivered the key thereof to his father.\u00a0 At the time of delivering the key to\u00a0 his father he told him of the fact that he had balanced the books between them and that there was a balance in favor of the father of\u00a0 said amount.\u00a0 He also acknowledged to\u00a0 his\u00a0 father that he owed\u00a0 him\u00a0 that amount and that he would find the evidence thereof in his safe.<br\/><br\/>Ignacio went to Manila and there died on the 3d day of November, 1900.\u00a0\u00a0 On arriving in Manila Ignacio deposited in the Banco Espanol-Filipino the sum of P22,870, most of which was still on deposit in said\u00a0 bank at the time he died. Ignacio left surviving him his wife Filomena and two minor children, Felisa Bellosillo and Jesus Bellosillo, his only heirs at\u00a0 law.\u00a0\u00a0 During the\u00a0 month\u00a0 of April or May,\u00a0 1901,\u00a0 the defendant, Isidro Azarraga, was appointed guardian of said children.\u00a0\u00a0 Immediately after his appointment as such guardian\u00a0 the defendant\u00a0 withdrew from\u00a0 the said bank substantially all of the money there on deposit.\u00a0 So far as\u00a0 can be\u00a0 ascertained from the record in this case\u00a0 said money so deposited, if it were\u00a0 the money of Ignacio,\u00a0 constituted all of\u00a0 his estate.\u00a0 The claim of Gregorio for the said balance seems to have been the only debt outstanding against Ignacio when he died.<br\/><br\/>Gregorio Villarruz\u00a0 died in Capiz on\u00a0 the 31st day of July, 1905.\u00a0 During his lifetime he made no effort to collect\u00a0 the amount due\u00a0 him from Ignacio.\u00a0 Soon after his\u00a0 death\u00a0 the plaintiff was appointed his administrator and duly qualified as such.\u00a0\u00a0 This action is brought by the plaintiff as administrator of\u00a0 his father's estate to recover from the defendant as guardian the sum due from the estate of Ignacio Bellosillo to the estate of Gregorio Villarruz, basing that\u00a0 right of action upon the claim that the defendant as\u00a0 guardian took possession of the estate of the deceased Ignacio, converting the same\u00a0 to his use as such guardian\u00a0 and that thereby\u00a0 he became responsible for the\u00a0 debts of\u00a0 the said\u00a0 Ignacio Bellosillo.<br\/><br\/>Judgment\u00a0 was rendered in favor\u00a0 of the plaintiff in\u00a0 the court below for the sum of P10,102, with interest thereon from\u00a0 the\u00a0 commencement of the action.\u00a0\u00a0 From that\u00a0 judgment\u00a0 this appeal is taken.<br\/><br\/>We have carefully examined the fourteen assignments of error on\u00a0 the part\u00a0 of the\u00a0 appellant's\u00a0 counsel\u00a0 and passed adversely\u00a0 upon them\u00a0 all.\u00a0 We\u00a0 find\u00a0 it necessary\u00a0 to\u00a0 refer specifically to only the following ones, the others being reviewed by\u00a0 implication.\u00a0 The first\u00a0 is an objection to the jurisdiction of the court on\u00a0 account\u00a0 of the lack of personality of the plaintiff, accompanied with the allegations that the facts stated in the complaint are insufficient to sustain a cause of action and that\u00a0 the complaint is unintelligible and vague.\u00a0 There is no question about the right of an administrator to begin an action for the purpose of recovering a debt due the estate.\u00a0\u00a0 That is expressly granted by section 702 of the Code of\u00a0 Civil Procedure.\u00a0 The complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, clearly and definitely.<br\/><br\/>In the second error assigned\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant's\u00a0 counsel maintains that the court below had no jurisdiction over the subject-matter of the litigation, alleging that actions against executors, administrators, and guardians, touching the performance of their official duties, and actions for account and settlement by them, and actions for the distribution of the estates\u00a0 of deceased persons among the heirs and distributees, and actions\u00a0 for the\u00a0 payment\u00a0 of legacies,\u00a0 shall be brought in the province in which the will was admitted to probate\u00a0 or\u00a0 letters of\u00a0 administration were granted or the guardian was appointed.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 action\u00a0 at\u00a0 bar is\u00a0 not one which falls within the terms or the meaning of said section. The action\u00a0 was\u00a0 properly brought\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 Court of First Instance of Capiz.<br\/><br\/>As to\u00a0 the\u00a0\u00a0 eleventh error assigned by\u00a0 the\u00a0 appellant, namely, that the right\u00a0 to maintain the action had prescribed before its commencement, it is necessary only to\u00a0 refer to section 38 of the Code\u00a0 of Civil Procedure.\u00a0 It has been held by\u00a0 this court\u00a0 that the rule of prescription\u00a0 to be applied where the right of action arose before the present code went into effect\u00a0 is that stated in the Civil Code or in the laws in force prior to the Civil Code.\u00a0 (Araneta <i>vs. <\/i>Garrido, 5 Phil.

It is admitted in the record that a subpcena for its production was secured and\u00a0 served\u00a0 upon the defendant and that the defendant failed and neglected\u00a0 to produce such book for evidentiary\u00a0 purposes.\u00a0 Its\u00a0 contents were\u00a0 proved by several reputable and disinterested witnesses.\u00a0 Letters from Ignacio to his father disclosing\u00a0 substantially the\u00a0 same condition of the account as indicated by the account book itself were identified and\u00a0 proved and\u00a0 were admitted\u00a0 in evidence. There was substantially no\u00a0 evidence\u00a0 disproving any of the facts above stated except the very improbable story of some of\u00a0 defendant's\u00a0 witnesses,\u00a0 who\u00a0 alleged that said account book had been fabricated and made up for the occasion by Gregorio Villarruz and that early\u00a0 one morning, during the absence\u00a0 of\u00a0 Filomena\u00a0 at church,\u00a0 said Gregorio\u00a0 Villarruz surreptitiously\u00a0 entered her house\u00a0 and by connivance with her servants placed the said book in the safe where\u00a0 it was later found.\u00a0 The court below for apparent reasons rejected this story as untrue and passed\u00a0 upon the\u00a0 credibility of the witnesses presenting it.<br\/><br\/>The evidence of record abundantly justifies the decision of the court below.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court\u00a0 below is, therefore, affirmed, with costs against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C,\u00a0 J., Torres,\u00a0 Mapa,\u00a0 Johnson,\u00a0 Carson<\/i>, and\u00a0 <i>Elliott, JJ.,<\/i> concur.<br\/><\/div>",

Rep., 537.)<br\/><br\/>From the context of the said possessory information it is perfectly well proven that the land which was usurped by the defendant five years ago is included in the said\u00a0 information and is a part of the first parcel\u00a0 mentioned therein, which land is situated between the two places called Nambaran, to the north, and Mumud, to the south, of the district of Bacarra, and its old boundaries agree with those given in the complaint and by plaintiff's witnesses in their testimony, as well as with those contained in the record\u00a0 of the ocular inspection.<br\/><br\/>This\u00a0 inspection was made,\u00a0 it is\u00a0 true,\u00a0 at\u00a0 the request of the defendant's attorney.\u00a0 The deputy\u00a0 sheriff and the litigating parties with\u00a0 their respective attorneys went\u00a0 to the place where the property in question\u00a0 is\u00a0 situated and the deputy sheriff proceeded\u00a0 to measure the land, the southern part of which it\u00a0 is claimed was\u00a0 usurped by the plaintiff.\u00a0 This measurement shows the present boundaries to be, to the north, the properties of Gregorio Bulusan and Graciano Galan; to the\u00a0 east, those of the said\u00a0 Bulusan and Hilario\u00a0 Magaoay; to the south,\u00a0 that of the said Magaoay, and to the west, that of Antonio Acob.\u00a0\u00a0 It was also\u00a0 ascertained that the property has a perimeter of 438 meters. The part of the\u00a0 said land alleged to be unlawfully\u00a0 withheld by\u00a0 the defendant having likewise been measured, it was found that its boundaries are, to the north, the\u00a0 property of Regino Salacup; to the\u00a0 east and\u00a0 south, that of Hilario Magaoay, and to the west, that of Alvaro Galapon.\u00a0 These measurements confirm the averments made by the plaintiff in\u00a0 his complaint, that the defendant usurped the southern part of plaintiff's land.\u00a0\u00a0 The property in question claimed by the defendant has a perimeter of 202 meters, and\u00a0 according to the report of the deputy sheriff, who carried\u00a0 out the above-mentioned proceedings,\u00a0 which report was made pursuant to an order issued by the court and an agreement by the attorneys for both litigants,\u00a0 the said land held by\u00a0 the defendant, of 202 meters perimeter,\u00a0 is included\u00a0 within\u00a0 the 438 meters\u00a0 of plaintiff's\u00a0 land, this lesser parcel being situated in the southern part of the greater\u00a0 one designated by the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>From the foregoing facts it is\u00a0 clearly shown that\u00a0 the plaintiff legally possessed the said real property that was usurped under claim of ownership, as proved by the possessory information\u00a0 entered in\u00a0 the registry of property, which he exhibited. The identity of the land\u00a0 unlawfully held by the defendant has also been proved in a conclusive manner, and as the said defendant has in nowise substantiated his claim that he is the owner of the land\u00a0 in question, the action instituted for the recovery of title is\u00a0 unquestionably proper and restitution must be made of the property so unduly held, together with the products collected therefrom or\u00a0 their value, inasmuch as it was proven at the trial that the defendant usurped the\u00a0 said land and was\u00a0 unlawfully holding\u00a0 it without\u00a0 either\u00a0 title or\u00a0 good reason, and consequently he could not acquire the\u00a0 status of owner in good faith,\u00a0 in\u00a0 accordance with the provisions of article 433 of the Civil\u00a0 Code.<br\/><br\/>It is, therefore, incontrovertible\u00a0 that the plaintiff is\u00a0 the owner of the\u00a0 land in question, and accordingly he has a right of\u00a0 action\u00a0 against\u00a0 the holder\u00a0 and possessor of\u00a0 the said land to recover the same, pursuant to the provisions of article 348 of the Civil Code.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons,\u00a0 it is proper, in our opinion, with a reversal of the judgment appealed from, to condemn, as\u00a0 we do hereby condemn the defendant, Sotero Rambac, to restore the aforesaid part of the land unlawfully held, measuring some 202 meters in perimeter, to Regino Salacup, who\u00a0 is declared to be the owner thereof, together with\u00a0 5 <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">uyones,\u00a0<\/span> 5 <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">baares,<\/span>\u00a0 and 5 <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">manojos<\/span>\u00a0 of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">palay <\/span>or their value, P55.60.\u00a0\u00a0 No special finding is made as to the costs in either instance.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

recovery of 14\u00a0 carabaos.\u00a0 The trial court rendered judgment sentencing the defendant to return them to the\u00a0 plaintiff,\u00a0 and against said judgment the former has interposed an appeal.<br\/><br\/>In November, 1904, Tomas Ravida, the defendant herein, filed a complaint with the court of the justice of the peace of Cajidiocan, Province of Romblon, against Francisca Rabino in connection with the delivery of thirteen carabaos, and obtained a final judgment in his favor.\u00a0 As no carabaos were\u00a0 found in\u00a0 the possession of the said Francisca,\u00a0 the sentence was executed by\u00a0 seizing\u00a0 fourteen carabaos that were\u00a0 in the possession of Jose Rabino,\u00a0 the father of said Francisca\u00a0 and plaintiff\u00a0 in\u00a0 the present\u00a0 case.\u00a0\u00a0 The sheriff who executed that sentence testified at\u00a0 the trial\u00a0 that although Ravida only claimed thirteen and a half carabaos, fourteen were\u00a0 delivered to him,\u00a0 because (<i>sic)\u00a0 no such fraction existed.<\/i><br\/><br\/>The plaintiff\u00a0 alleges\u00a0 that\u00a0 the\u00a0 fourteen carabaos\u00a0 delivered to Ravida were of his sole and exclusive ownership, and not of his daughter Francisca, against whom the said Ravida obtained judgment in the court of the justice of the peace\u00a0 of Cajidiocan.\u00a0 The\u00a0 latter\u00a0 on\u00a0 his part, maintains that said carabaos belong to him as one-half of the product of a caraballa (female carabao) which he delivered to Francisca to keep for breeding purposes on condition that they should divide between them such calves or offspring as it might\u00a0 have.<br\/><br\/>We have not before us the record of the action\u00a0 brought by Tomas\u00a0 Ravida against Francisca Rabino\u00a0 in the\u00a0 court of the justice of the peace of Cajidiocan, nor the proceedings followed in the execution of the\u00a0 sentence\u00a0 entered therein.\u00a0 But Emiterio Riva, the deputy sheriff who executed\u00a0 the said sentence, was presented\u00a0 as witness by\u00a0 the defendant,\u00a0 and it appears from his declaration that when he sought to execute the sentence, Francisca told him that she did not have a single carabao,\u00a0 for which reason the justice of the peace\u00a0 \"<i>issued\u00a0 another order of execution<\/i> [these are his own words] <i>not upon\u00a0 Francisco, Rabino, but upon Jose Rabino, because the latter was the head of the family,\u00a0 and the former was\u00a0 single and\u00a0 lived under the shelter of her father.\"\u00a0 <\/i> And\u00a0 the\u00a0 witness\u00a0 adds, <i>\"in\u00a0 compliance with\u00a0 the second order of\u00a0 execution, the sentence was executed on said carabaos\u00a0 occupied by Jose Rabino.<\/i>\"<br\/><br\/>The said witness has very clearly stated that the carabaos delivered to Tomas Ravida by virtue of the execution of the sentence against Francisca Rabino were taken, not from the possession of the\u00a0 latter but from that\u00a0 of her father, Jose Rabino, who\u00a0 owned them, or, as asserted by\u00a0 said witness, <i>occupied them<\/i>;\u00a0 that to this end a second order of execution was issued, nominally addressed to the said Jose Rabino,\u00a0 and that the\u00a0 only reason\u00a0 that the\u00a0 justice\u00a0 of the peace\u00a0 of Cajidiocan had in acting\u00a0 thus, was the fact that said Rabino is the\u00a0 father\u00a0 of\u00a0 Francisca, and because the latter, being a single woman, lived\u00a0 under the shelter of her father's roof.<br\/><br\/>Such a declaration is\u00a0 of great importance as being that made\u00a0 by the officer who executed\u00a0 the sentence entered against Francisca\u00a0 Rabino, and its terms\u00a0 speak fully\u00a0 in favor of the plaintiff herein inasmuch as it was not\u00a0 lawful or\u00a0 proper to issue\u00a0 an\u00a0 execution against him by virtue\u00a0 of a judgment\u00a0 rendered only and exclusively against\u00a0 the former, and much less to\u00a0 dispossess him without due process of law of his carabaos, as occurred\u00a0 by reason of said order of execution.\u00a0 To thus deprive the plaintiff of the carabaos that he possessed was manifestly\u00a0 illegal,\u00a0 therefore he is entitled to recover them\u00a0 from the defendant, who by such unlawful means acquired the possessiGn thereof.\u00a0 (Art. 464, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>The asseveration of the said\u00a0 witness for\u00a0 the defendant that it was the plaintiff herein,\u00a0 not\u00a0 his daughter Francisca, who possessed the fourteen carabaos in question, is fully corroborated by the\u00a0 testimony of other witnesses who testified in the same sense\u00a0 at the trial.\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, said\u00a0 witnesses positively aver that said carabaos are the property of\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiff.\u00a0 The appellant\u00a0 states in\u00a0 his\u00a0 brief that said witnesses did not know, nor could they know what they were testifying except from hearsay, but he advances no reason whatever in support of such allegation.\u00a0\u00a0 The truth is that their declarations appear\u00a0 as made from their own knowledge of the the\u00a0 matter and not merely from hearsay.<br\/><br\/>Apart from\u00a0 the declarations of the witnesses above alluded to in\u00a0 connection\u00a0 with the plaintiff's ownership,\u00a0 it is unquestionable that he is protected by a just and lawful title in that he was\u00a0 in possession of\u00a0 the\u00a0 said carabaos, and it has not\u00a0 been\u00a0 demonstrated that he possessed them with bad faith.\u00a0 It is an express provision of law that the possession\u00a0 of personal property acquired with\u00a0 good faith, is equivalent to a title\u00a0 thereto.\u00a0\u00a0 (Art. 464, <i>supra<\/i>.)<br\/><br\/>The title set\u00a0 up by the defendant against that of the plaintiff is based on\u00a0 the right of accession, because it\u00a0 is said that the carabaos in question were the get of a carabao that 18 years ago he delivered into the care of Francisca Rabino, the daughter of said plaintiff.\u00a0 Such a claim can not\u00a0 prosper\u00a0 except by clear and\u00a0 positive proof that the carabaos above referred to\u00a0 are out of the defendant's caraballa.\u00a0 It does not suffice\u00a0 to say\u00a0 or prove that the latter had a given number\u00a0 of calves, but\u00a0 it must be shown in addition that such calves are precisely the ones herein referred to, and the record does not contain sufficient evidence of such identification.\u00a0 The declarations of the witnesses for the defendant, given in vague and general terms,\u00a0 do not, nor can\u00a0 they lead to such proof.\u00a0\u00a0 None of them positively and\u00a0 categorically\u00a0 asserts that said carabaos are the get of the caraballa\u00a0 placed by the defendant in the care of said\u00a0 Francisca, and we certainly believe that it would be a difficult matter\u00a0 for them to\u00a0 make such an assertion, taking into account that the oldest carabao\u00a0 was but about four years old, the rest being three, two, and one year old only, as testified by the defendant himself.\u00a0\u00a0 It seems to us that it\u00a0 would\u00a0 be an\u00a0 extraordinary\u00a0 thing\u00a0 if\u00a0 a caraballa could produce fourteen\u00a0 calves in\u00a0 a period of four years, yet\u00a0 this\u00a0 is what would actually\u00a0 appear from\u00a0 the plain statement, made without any explanation whatever, in the written answer of the defendant, that the\u00a0 carabaos above referred to are the product of his caraballa.<br\/><br\/>In support of his claim he makes the following statement in paragraph 2 of the complaint:<br\/><blockquote>\"That on the 16th of November, 1904,\u00a0 the defendant, Tomas Ravida, presented a complaint in the court of the justice\u00a0 of the peace\u00a0 of\u00a0 Cajidiocan, Romblon, Philippine Islands, against Francisca Rabino in connection with thirteen carabaos, and she was sentenced to deliver said carabaos\u00a0 to\u00a0 the\u00a0 then plaintiff, Tomas Ravida;\u00a0 the\u00a0 sentence was executed\u00a0 by Emiterio Riva, the sheriff\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 said town of Cajidiocan.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Indeed\u00a0 it is not easy to\u00a0 understand how this\u00a0 allegation can constitute evidence of any kind in favor of the defendant.\u00a0 It\u00a0 is set\u00a0 out therein\u00a0 that Francisca\u00a0 Rabino, in an action brought against her\u00a0 by the defendant therein, was sentenced to deliver to the latter thirteen carabaos, but that does not say\u00a0 or\u00a0 mean\u00a0 that the carabaos that were taken from the\u00a0 possession of Jose Rabino to be delivered to\u00a0 the defendant in compliance with said judgment were the property of the defendant\u00a0 and\u00a0 not of Jose Rabino, which is the subject of this controversy.\u00a0 Neither can the other assertion in\u00a0 the appellant's brief,\u00a0 to the\u00a0 effect\u00a0 that Francisca had\u00a0 consented to said\u00a0 judgment, mean\u00a0 such a thing,\u00a0 because from the fact that the\u00a0 latter was obliged to deliver thirteen carabaos it\u00a0 does not follow that the carabaos here in question, which were in\u00a0 the possession of the plaintiff and\u00a0 not\u00a0 of said Francisca, were the property of the\u00a0 defendant, or that they\u00a0 were the identical ones that were the subject of the complaint filed by him against Francisca Rabino.\u00a0\u00a0 For the rest\u00a0 it is quite unnecessary to\u00a0 say that the judgment entered\u00a0 against the latter should\u00a0 not, nor can it prejudice\u00a0 the plaintiff herein who was not a party to the suit in which\u00a0 the same\u00a0 was rendered.\u00a0\u00a0 (Par.\u00a0 2, sec. 306,\u00a0 Code of Civil Procedure.)<br\/><br\/>The trial judge found that when the delivery of the fourteen carabaos was\u00a0 made to Tomas Ravida, the brands on the same\u00a0 (the property of\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiff) were new and most of them recently made, and that they had apparently been branded some three or four days prior to said delivery. This fact is put forward by the appellant as proving that said carabaos did not really belong to the plaintiff Rabino. It seems that he desired to\u00a0 say by\u00a0 this that\u00a0 if the latter were\u00a0 really\u00a0 the\u00a0 owner of\u00a0 the carabaos\u00a0 he\u00a0 would\u00a0 have branded them long before that date; but if this observation were of any\u00a0 value it would necessarily be against the appellant, inasmuch as said animals did not then bear his brand, old or recent, and the brand they bore was owned by the plaintiff, and duly registered by him in September, 1904.<br\/><br\/>It is literally stated\u00a0 in the appellant's brief that -<br\/><blockquote>\"Two witnesses, the defendant Tomas Ravida and Jose Ramiro, declare that in the\u00a0 time\u00a0 of the Spanish Government, that is to say, in the year 1894, when\u00a0 the present plaintiff\u00a0 was a defendant and his property was attached, he declared\u00a0 that\u00a0 the\u00a0 said\u00a0 carabaos all\u00a0 belonged\u00a0 to his daughter Francisca, and that the plaintiff did not\u00a0 in any manner deny such declarations.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>He certainly had no need to deny them.\u00a0 If the witnesses refer therein to the carabaos now\u00a0 in question,\u00a0 it is evident that they perverted the truth, inasmuch as the oldest of the animals being but four years\u00a0 old, none of them existed in the\u00a0 year 1894; and if as it seems they speak of other carabaos, their testimony is\u00a0 of no importance\u00a0 since it does not refer\u00a0 to\u00a0 the subject-matter of the present litigation.<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing it can not be said that the statement contained in the judgment appealed from, that the fourteen\u00a0 carabaos\u00a0 mentioned\u00a0 in\u00a0 the complaint are the exclusive property of and belong\u00a0 to\u00a0 the plaintiff, and that the defendant Rabino has not shown a better title or\u00a0 right to the\u00a0 said carabaos than the plaintiff, is\u00a0 contrary to the weight of the evidence in the case.\u00a0 After\u00a0 arriving at this conclusion\u00a0 it .appears entirely unnecessary to discuss the doctrine\u00a0 established\u00a0 in the\u00a0 said judgment\u00a0 in connection with the statute of limitations of personal property,\u00a0 prescription which has also been considered by the court below as a title of dominion in favor of the plaintiff.\u00a0 We therefore expressly refrain from considering this particular point of\u00a0 the judgment\u00a0 appealed\u00a0 from.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 said\u00a0 judgment\u00a0 is hereby affirmed with the costs of this instance against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i> Arellano, C.

The deceased ran around to the front of the jail and entered the front door of the\u00a0 municipal building,\u00a0 pursued by the defendants.\u00a0 On arriving just inside of the door of the municipal\u00a0 building the defendant\u00a0 Palaobsanon fired\u00a0 a fifth shot,\u00a0 from the effects of which\u00a0 the deceased died within five minutes.<br\/><br\/>The defendants were convicted of\u00a0 the crime of homicide and each one\u00a0 was\u00a0 sentenced to\u00a0 reclusion\u00a0 temporal for a period of fourteen years eight months and one day, to pay one-half the costs, and to\u00a0 indemnify the\u00a0 heirs of the deceased in the sum of PI,000.\u00a0 From\u00a0 this judgment of conviction and the sentence imposed thereunder the defendants appealed to this court.<br\/><br\/>The guilt of the defendant Palaobsanon is clearly demonstrated:<br\/><ol><li>By the testimony of Crisanto Periano, another prisoner in the jail, who went out at the same time with the deceased and the defendants in order to empty a urinal.\u00a0 He testified that on approaching the corner of the\u00a0 municipal\u00a0 building Castro ordered the deceased not to go to the water-closet, because it\u00a0 was very dirty, but\u00a0 to go instead to a grove\u00a0 of banana trees which stood\u00a0 near by; that as the deceased started to obey,\u00a0 the defendant Palaobsanon\u00a0 discharged his revolver\u00a0 at him; that\u00a0 thereupon the witness ran around into the jail.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>By the testimony of Mateo Campo and Simeon Malbago, also\u00a0 prisoners in\u00a0 the jail, who\u00a0 testified to the same effect as\u00a0 Periano, substantially, and who further said that they saw the deceased when he received the shot inside\u00a0 of the jail which caused his death; that he\u00a0 was kneeling down and was\u00a0 shot by the defendant Palaobsanon; that the deceased was not\u00a0 hurt by\u00a0 the first four shots, which were all fired in the rear of the jail.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>By the testimony of Leona Gimeno, who testified that she was an inmate of the house of Agustin Ilagan, which stood very near\u00a0 the jail and that she\u00a0 saw a portion of the occurrence involving the death of the deceased.\u00a0 She testified that\u00a0 she heard the\u00a0 first and second shots, but did not go out of the house; that she went\u00a0 out when the third shot was fired;\u00a0 that from the veranda\u00a0 where she was she saw the man\u00a0 who was shot\u00a0 by\u00a0 the policeman as he was going into the front door of the municipal building; that he was running backwards toward the front door of the jail, with his hands held up before him and that the policeman Palaobsanon was following him with a revolver; that the fifth shot occurred inside of the municipal building; that she did not see the defendant Castro\u00a0 shoot at the deceased;\u00a0 that she knew the fifth shot\u00a0 was fired by Palaobsanon\u00a0 because he was the man\u00a0 who was holding the revolver; that so far as she knew the\u00a0 other defendant had no\u00a0 revolver.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>By the testimony of Narciso Baoyan, who was an inmate of the said house of Ilagan.\u00a0 He testified that he was on the verandah and saw the deceased running, followed by two policemen; that the first he saw was the deceased walking toward the banana trees accompanied by two policemen; that he\u00a0 heard the\u00a0 last\u00a0 shot fired inside of the\u00a0 municipal building; that when the deceased was running around the municipal building he was not wounded; that\u00a0 he saw no blood upon the clothes\u00a0 of\u00a0 deceased or anywhere else and that after the policeman had fired four shots at him he was still able to jump through or over the fence surrounding the garden.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>By the testimony of Agapito Golera, a physician, who made a\u00a0 post-mortem examination of the\u00a0 body of the deceased.\u00a0\u00a0 He testified\u00a0 that at the request of the\u00a0 justice of the peace he examined the corpse of Isidro Blanco in the municipal jail aforesaid about an hour and a half after he was shot.\u00a0 He testified that he found the deceased\u00a0 lying face down; that the body showed a gunshot wound near the right shoulder blade and another on the front of the body where the bullet came out; that the wound was\u00a0 located in the upper chest; that death was necessarily caused by this wound, because one of the important arteries was cut;.that, considering the seriousness of the wound, the deceased, if he had received the same in the rear of the municipal building near the banana grove, would not have been able to pass around to the front of the municipal building and enter the front door thereof, as he in fact did; that the wound was of such a character that the deceased could not have gone after receiving it more than about 10 steps when he would have fallen down;\u00a0 that the\u00a0 distance from the banana trees around to the front door of the municipal building is about 35 meters; that when he entered the municipal building for the purpose of examining the corpse, he saw spots of blood on the floor, beginning about 10 steps from where the deceased lay dead; that at the place where he lay there was much blood.<\/li><\/ol>The defense offered by the accused was that the deceased used the privilege to go to the water-closet as a means of effecting his escape and that on\u00a0 arriving in the courtyard in the rear of the jail\u00a0 he, instead of going to the water-closet, ran and jumped over the\u00a0 fence and started for the mountains; that they ordered him to halt; that he refused to do so but keep on running; that the defendant Palaobsanon thereupon\u00a0 began\u00a0 to shoot at him; that all five\u00a0 shots were fired in the rear of the municipal building;\u00a0 that the wound which caused the death of the deceased was\u00a0 made in the rear of the municipal building while the defendants were\u00a0 attempting to prevent his escape;\u00a0 that\u00a0 there\u00a0 were blood spots found near\u00a0 the banana trees and the course of the deceased around the municipal building to the\u00a0 front thereof was marked by drops of blood; that they did not shoot him inside of the municipal building\u00a0 but that all of the shots were fired in the rear thereof and for the purpose of preventing his escape.<br\/><br\/>This claim and the evidence offered to support it are in direct contradiction\u00a0 to\u00a0 the theory of the prosecution and the evidence offered to support it.\u00a0 The\u00a0 court below saw the witnesses upon the\u00a0 stand and observed their manner of testifying.\u00a0 After a\u00a0 careful analysis of the\u00a0 evidence he arrived at the conclusion that the defendants\u00a0 were guilty beyond a\u00a0 reasonable doubt.\u00a0 We have carefully examined the evidence in this case and weighed it\u00a0 thoroughly.\u00a0 We are convinced that the conclusion\u00a0 of the court below is fully sustained\u00a0 by the proofs as to the defendant Palaobsanon. We are of the opinion, however, that as\u00a0 to the defendant Melecio Castro, the proofs are not sufficient\u00a0 to warrant his conviction.\u00a0 It is conceded that he did not fire the shot which killed the deceased.\u00a0\u00a0 It appears from the testimony of most of the witnesses that this defendant did not fire a shot at any time, and from some of them that he did not have a revolver.<br\/><br\/>The court below imposed the penalty in the minimum of the medium degree.\u00a0 From the\u00a0 proofs it clearly appears that the aggravating circumstance specified in subdivision 11 of article 10 of the Penal Code, namely that the culprit took advantage of his public position to commit the crime, is present.\u00a0\u00a0 The penalty therefore\u00a0 should\u00a0 have been imposed in its maximum degree.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below as to Melecio Castro is hereby reversed and the defendant is acquitted and his discharge from custody ordered; as to the defendant\u00a0 Palaobsanon, the judgment of the court below is modified\u00a0 and the said defendant is hereby condemned to seventeen years four months and\u00a0 one day of reclusion temporal, to the accessories provided in article 59 of the Penal Code, and to indemnify the heirs\u00a0 of the deceased\u00a0 Blanco\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 sum\u00a0 of Pl,000, and to pay the costs of this action.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Such conspiracies on\u00a0 the part of prisoners keenly\u00a0 resentful of the authorities\u00a0 set over them are\u00a0 too\u00a0 frequent in\u00a0 the common\u00a0 experience of\u00a0 those who have to deal\u00a0 with them to justify the acceptance of such testimony without rigid and painstaking scrutiny.<\/div>",

Rep., 360.)<br\/><br\/>The following remarks of the Supreme Court of California in a\u00a0 somewhat similar case (Quirk <i>vs.<\/i>\u00a0 Rooney, 130 Cal., 511), aptly express the grounds upon which the doctrine of <i>res judicata<\/i> is based, and are worthy\u00a0 of quotation in this connection:<br\/><blockquote>\"We fully appreciate the fact that if there\u00a0 had been no final\u00a0 decree of distribution in the estate of Bryan Lynch, deceased, and\u00a0 no former adjudication,\u00a0 the plaintiff's claim would be meritorious.\u00a0 But courts must follow general and well-established rules of law applicable to all cases and for the benefit of all.\u00a0 If plaintiff, through negligence in not properly presenting her case at the former trial, has lost her right to the property in controversy, it is a hardship, but one from\u00a0 which we\u00a0 have no\u00a0 power\u00a0 in this action to grant relief.\u00a0 To adopt any other rule than this one we have followed\u00a0 would open a 'Pandora's box' of evils that would upset\u00a0 the rules of property and the respect for final judgment\u00a0 of the courts.\"<\/blockquote>Counsel for\u00a0 appellant contends that the judgment in the former case was not a bar to another action,\u00a0 because the disposing part thereof merely dismissed the plaintiff's action, and did not in express terms <i>absolve (absolver)<\/i> the defendants from the cause of action set out in the complaint.\u00a0\u00a0 But the court expressly held that the plaintiff\u00a0 in that action was \"not entitled to the relief sought,\" and\u00a0 after due trial and submission of the\u00a0 case dismissed the action, wholly and completely disposing of all the issues raised in the pleadings; this dismissal did in effect <i>absolve<\/i> the defendants.\u00a0\u00a0 Such a dismissal is not to\u00a0 be\u00a0 confounded with the dismissal of an action under the provisions\u00a0 of\u00a0 section 127\u00a0 of the Code of Civil\u00a0 Procedure,\u00a0 wherein the right to a new action is expressly reserved to the plaintiff, the judgment of dismissal not being a judgment based upon a decision of the issues raised by the pleadings.<br\/><br\/>The judgment in the\u00a0 former case was in English,\u00a0 and counsel's erroneous contention as to its effect is\u00a0 probably based\u00a0 upon a translation wherein the English word \"dismissed\"\u00a0 is treated\u00a0 as\u00a0 a\u00a0 precise equivalent of the Spanish word\u00a0 sobreseido.\u00a0\u00a0 Strictly speaking, however, the Spanish word\u00a0 sobreseer taken by itself is properly limited to cases of dismissal of a complaint or action such as those mentioned in section 127 of the Code of Civil Procedure, wherein the judgment does\u00a0 not dispose\u00a0 of the issues\u00a0 raised by\u00a0 the pleadings;\u00a0 and the English word dismissed in the phrases \"the complaint <i>is dismissed<\/i>\" or\u00a0 <i>\"the action is dismissed\"<\/i> is not accurately rendered by\u00a0 the use of the\u00a0 Spanish word \"<i>sobreseer\"<\/i> when this English word is used in the disposing part of a judgment which disposes of the issues raised in the pleadings.\u00a0 In such cases the Spanish words <i>\"sobreseer definitivamente\"<\/i> would more nearly express the full meaning and effect of the English word dismiss when used in this connection, the dismissal in English being understood to be \"without day.\"<br\/><br\/>Plaintiff in this action based her prayer for relief\u00a0 on her allegations\u00a0 that by\u00a0 virtue of certain advances made to the defendants she became the owner of the house in question, and the defendants on the witness stand admitted that some of these advances were in fact made them, but insisted that they were made by way of loans, and\u00a0 not as the purchase price of the house in question.\u00a0 In the light of this evidence of\u00a0 record, we think it proper\u00a0 to\u00a0 indicate that while the plaintiff can not have the relief prayed for in this action, neither the judgment in the former case nor the judgment in this case deprives the\u00a0 plaintiff of\u00a0 her\u00a0 right\u00a0 of action to recover the amount of any such advances still remaining unpaid.<br\/><br\/>Basing\u00a0 our decision\u00a0 strictly upon the doctrine of <i>res adjudicata<\/i> as laid down in the above-cited section of the code, the judgment of the lower court in this case in favor of the defendants and against the plaintiff must be affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

ANTONIA JUMAUAN ET AL., DEFENDANTS. - ANTONIA JUMAUAN, APPELLANT.<br\/>\n<br\/>\nD E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">On January 29,1908, Apolinaria Tanido, the administratrix of the intestate estate of the Chinaman Jose Martinez, filed a written complaint in the Court of First Instance of Misamis, alleging that Prudencio Velez, during his lifetime and during his marriage with Antonia Jumauan, owed the Chinaman Jose Martinez the sum of P983, as ascertained from the settlement had after the death, of the debtor, Prudencio Velez, in July, 1901, between the creditor, Martinez, on the one hand, and Mariano Velez and Antonia Jumauan, on the other, the father and the widow, respectively, of the deceased Velez and .the latter's sole heirs; and that, on the same date, July, 1901, the aforesaid Mariano Velez and Antonia Jumauan, in payment of the said debt, deeded to the said creditor Martinez all the property that belonged to the deceased debtor, among which were the following:<br\/><br\/>(<i>a<\/i>) A parcel of land, containing several coconut trees and measuring 51 and 57 meters on its north side, 18 and 70 meters on its east and south sides, and 82 meters on its west side, and adjoining the lands of Juan Portacion in the sitio of Bulalo, barrio of Baliangao, Langaran, Misamis.<br\/><br\/>(<i>b<\/i>) Another parcel of coconut land in the same <i>sitio<\/i> of Bulalo, bounded on the north by the lands of Francisco Cabrenes, Apolinaria Tanido, and Juan Portacion, on the south by that of Gertrudis Villanueva, on the east by that of Juan Portacion, and on the west by that of Apolinaria Tanido.<br\/><br\/>(<i>c<\/i>) Another parcel of coconut land in the same sitio, bounded on the north and east by the land of Juan Portacion, on the south by that of Gertrudis Villanueva, and on the west by that of the said Portacion.<br\/><br\/>(<i>d<\/i>)\u00a0\u00a0 Another parcel of land in the same <i>sitio,<\/i> bounded on the north by the seashore, on the south and east by the lands of Apolinaria Tanido, Pedro Ytong, and Juan Portacion, and on the west by those of Francisco Cabrenes and Esteban Sobrado.<br\/><br\/>(<i>e<\/i>)\u00a0\u00a0 Another parcel of coconut land in the barrio of Baliangao, bounded on the north by the lands of Vicente Cabaza, Alipio Sambulan, and Bernardino Jumauan, on the south by mangrove swamps, on the east by the land of Macario Jurane, and on the west by a mangrove swamp.<br\/><br\/>(<i>f<\/i>) Another parcel of coconut land in the same sitio of Baliangao, bounded on the north by the land of Francisco Duhaylunsud, on the south and east by that of Ignacio Caroro, and on the west and east by that of Francisco Duhaylunsud.<br\/><br\/>(<i>g<\/i>) A fishery, in the cove of the barrio of Baliangao and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">sitio<\/span> called Naburos, which belonged exclusively to the deceased Velez.<br\/><br\/>(<i>h<\/i>) A house and lot where the defendant Jumauan resides, in Baliangao, bounded on the north by the land of the plaintiff, on the east by that of Magdalena Caroro, on the south by a public road, and on the west also by land of the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>Moreover, on the land situated in the <i>sitio<\/i> of Dao, bounded on the north by those of Ynday Magusara and Saturnino Villanueva, on the south by the seashore, on the east by the horse trail, and on the west by the land of Lucio Caroro, in the southeastern part thereof, there are planted twenty coconut trees, adjacent to the property of the intestate, and on the western boundary line of the property described under letter<i> h<\/i>, there are eight coconut trees, which also belonged to the intestate.<br\/><br\/>The complaint further recited that the defendant, Antonia Jumauan, illegally detained the properties designated under the letters (<i>a), (b), (c), (d), (g)<\/i>, and <i>(k)<\/i>, and retained the 28 coconut trees mentioned; that she refused to deliver the same to the plaintiff and thereby caused the latter damages to the extent of Pl;000; that the defendant, Calixto Velez, likewise illegally held the property, specified under letter (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">e<\/span>), by order of Antonia Jumauan, refusing to deliver it to the plaintiff, thereby occasioning her damages to the amount of T60; that the defendant Isidra Caroro, also, illegally held the property designated under letter (<i>f<\/i>), likewise by order of Antonia Jumauan, and refused to deliver it to the plaintiff, thereby causing the latter damages in the sum of P80. Plaintiff therefore prayed that the defendants be sentenced to deliver to her the said properties which they respectively held in their possession, to pay an indemnity to the plaintiff for the damages caused by each of them, and the costs.<br\/><br\/>The defendants, Antonia Jumauan, Calixto Velez, and Isidra Caroro, in their answer, denied each and all of the facts alleged in the complaint and each and all of the paragraphs thereof, and prayed that they be absolved, with the costs against the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>On June 2, 1909, the case came to trial, testimony was adduced by both parties to the action, the documents exhibited being attached to the record, and tha court, on July 29 of the same year, rendered judgment sentencing Antonia Jumauan to return to the plaintiff the properties described under Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, and absolved Calixto Velez from the complaint, with respect to the property No. 9, and likewise the other defendant, Isidra Caroro, with respect to the property No. 10, without special finding as to costs. Counsel for Antonia Jumauan took exception to this judgment and by a written motion asked for a new trial on the ground that the said judgment was contrary to the law and to the evidence. This motion was overruled, exception was taken by the appellant who duly filed the proper bill of exceptions which was admitted and forwarded to the clerk of this court, together with a transcript of the evidence and the original documents, duly certified.<br\/><br\/>In this suit a demand is made for the, return of several parcels of land, described in the complaint as detained by the defendant Antonia Jumauan, on the ground that they belonged to the deceased Jose Martinez by reason of their having been deeded to the latter during his lifetime, together with other property, by Prudencio Velez, the father of the debtor, Mariano Velez, now deceased, and by the latter's widow, the defendant, in payment of an amount greater than the value of the said property deeded, all in accordance with the instrument executed before the municipal president of Baliangao and witnesses, on July 3, 1901, appended to which document appear the signatures of the conveyors, the successors of the debtor, and that of the creditor, Jose Martinez.<br\/><br\/>From the evidence produced at trial, it appears that the defendant refused at first to sign the said instrument or deed of the property in payment of the debt in favor of the creditor, the Chinaman Jose Martinez, saying1, between sobs, that she would be left without means of support, inasmuch as she would be deprived of all the lands left by her deceased husband and even of the house in which she was living, whereupon the Chinaman, the creditor, perhaps moved to compassion, promised that he would return some of the properties deeded if she would sign the instrument of transfer or deed, and under this promise the defendant Jumauan signed it; and within a month thereafter, the Chinaman Martinez, fulfilling the promise made to the defendant, returned some of the lands conveyed, together with the house and a fishery, and for this purpose executed, on August 2,1901, the instrument marked \"Exhibit 1\" (p. 56 of the record), drawn up in the Visayan dialect and signed by the said Jose Martinez, the defendant Antonia Jumauan, and several witnesses, a translation of which appears on pages 59 to 61 of the record, and is accompanied by a note stating that it was presented before the two councilors of the town whose names are Mariano Villanueva and Roman Ocao, who identified their respective signatures and certified to the truth of the contents of the instrument and to the authenticity of the signatures affixed to the foot thereof, among which is that of the Chinaman Jose Martinez.<br\/><br\/>So that the defendant Jumauan agreed to the transfer of property set forth in the said first instrument in favor of the Chinaman Martinez and signed the document under the condition offered by the latter, that he would afterwards return to her some of the property transferred to him; and by the creditor's complying with the condition offered by him and accepted by the defendant, one of the transferrers, and executing the instrument Exhibit 1 within a month after that transfer, the Chinaman, the creditor, merely complied with the condition agreed upon to return to the debtor some of the property transferred, and such act does not constitute a gift, but a renunciation of the right to collect a part of the credit which the said Martinez held against the deceased husband of the defendant Jumauan.<br\/><br\/>In order to judge the intention of the contracting parties, says article 1282 of the Civil Code, attention must principally be paid to their acts, contemporaneous with and subsequent to the contract. The creditor Chinaman returned a part of the property transferred in payment of his credit, not as an act of mere liberality, but in compliance with the condition under which the defendant agreed to the transfer and signed the proper instrument.<br\/><br\/>The truth and authenticity of the instrument recording the return of some of the property delivered in payment of the debt of the deceased Prudencio Velez are unquestionable, and the legitimacy of the signature of the Chinaman Jose Martinez, affixed to the said instrument (p. 1 of the record), which, moreover, does not appear to have been impugned or assailed as false, can not be doubted. This same instrument evidences the fulfillment of the promise made by the creditor Chinaman to return the property therein mentioned because of the defendant Jumauan signing the deed of the date of July 3, 1901, as required of her by the said creditor.<br\/><br\/>The certainty and authenticity of the aforementioned promise being conceded, which promise constitutes a condition precedent proposed by Jose Martinez to the defendant Antonia Jumauan, it may well be affirmed that not until after the return promised by Martinez did the latter acquire an absolute right of ownership over all the property deeded to him, since the selection of the property which he was to return depended entirely on his free will, a condition established in order that the defendant Jumauan should sign the instrument of deed, and once the latter had been signed, the creditor Martinez voluntarily and in good faith complied with the condition offered by returning the house and other property which he himself had selected, and which of course were accepted by Jumauan, and therefore the fulfillment of a promise, a condition agreed upon in order that the said deed might be signed, can in no manner be construed as an act of gift, but as one of fulfillment of a condition stipulated between the parties.<br\/><br\/>Article 1255 of the Civil Code provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"The contracting parties may make the agreement and establish the clauses and conditions which they may deem advisable, provided they are not in contravention of law, morals, or public order.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The creditor Jose Martinez, moved by the tears of the defendant, the widow of the debtor, and by the thought of the precarious situation in which she would be left were she deprived of all the property left at death by his deceased debtor, including the house in which she was living, was impelled to promise that he would return a part of that property, together with the house, if she signed the deed. This promise, made as a condition for the perfection of the contract of deed and the signing of the instrument drawn up for the purpose, implying a renunciation of the collection of a part of his credit, is not contrary to law, to morals, or to public order.<br\/><br\/>When the creditor Chinaman made such renunciation by returning a part of the property deeded to him, he must have had reasons and motives therefor; and it is certain that, of his own free will, he thought it proper to remit the payment of a part of the sum owing him by leaving in the possession of the widow of his deceased debtor a part of the property which the latter had left at his death, especially the dwelling in which the said widow was living, and by executing for the purpose the instrument Exhibit 1, by reason of his friendship for the deceased; wherefore it is unquestionable that the second instrument is an expression of the fulfillment of the promise made at the time of the execution and signing of the first instrument.<br\/><br\/>Pursuant, then, to the terms of the instrument shown on page 1 of the record, and as property whose transfer the creditor renounced in favor of the defendant, the latter is entitled to hold, as owner, the house, the five parcels of land, and the location on the seashore used for fish weirs, described in the said instrument, and the sentence appealed from is deemed to be accordant with law and the merits of the case as disclosed by the record, with respect to the other property claimed by the plaintiff from the defendant Jumauan, and also with respect to the lands of Calixto Reyes and Isidra Caroro, against whom the plaintiff did not succeed in establishing the propriety of his claim.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons it is proper, in our opinion, with a reversal of such part of the judgment appealed from as is in conflict with this decision, to absolve, and we hereby absolve, Antonia Jumauan from the complaint filed by Apolinaria Tanido, whereby claim is made to the house, lands, and fishery site described in the instrument Exhibit 1 dated August 2, 1901 (p. 56 of the trial record) ; and the said Antonia Jumauan is sentenced to return to the plaintiff the lands designated in the judgment appealed from as Nos. 7 and 8, which are not included in the said instrument Exhibit 1; and, in this wise, the part of the judgment appealed from consistent with this decision is affirmed, as are the findings thereof whereby Calixto Velez is absolved from the complaint with respect to the property No. 9, and Isidra Caroro with respect to the property No. 10.\u00a0\u00a0 No special finding is made as to costs. It is so ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Johnson, Moreland,<\/i> and <i>Trent, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><\/div>",

For holding that the capital ought to have yielded profits, and that the latter should be calculated at 12 per cent per annum; and<\/li><\/ol><ol start=\"7\"><li>The findings of the judgment.<\/li><\/ol>As to the first assignment of error, the fact that the store was\u00a0 closed\u00a0 by\u00a0 virtue of\u00a0 ejectment proceedings is\u00a0 of\u00a0 no importance for the effects\u00a0 of the suit.\u00a0 The whole action is based upon\u00a0 the\u00a0 fact that\u00a0 the defendants received certain capital from the plaintiff for the\u00a0 purpose of organizing a company;\u00a0 they, according\u00a0 to the agreement, were\u00a0 to handle the said money and invest it in a store which was the object of\u00a0 the association; they, in the absence\u00a0 of a special agreement vesting in one sole person the management of the\u00a0 business, were the actual administrators\u00a0 thereof; as such administrators they were the agents of the company and incurred the\u00a0 liabilities peculiar to every agent, among which is\u00a0 that of rendering account to the principal of their transactions, and\u00a0 paying him everything they may have received by virtue of\u00a0 the <i>mandatum.<\/i>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Arts, 1695 and 1720, Civil\u00a0 Code.)\u00a0\u00a0 Neither of them\u00a0 has rendered\u00a0 such account nor proven the losses referred to\u00a0 by Ong Pong Co; they are therefore obliged to refund the money that they received for the purpose of establishing the said\u00a0 store - the object of the association.\u00a0\u00a0 This was the principal pronouncement of the judgment.<br\/><br\/>With\u00a0 regard\u00a0 to the second and third assignments of error, this court, like the court below,\u00a0 finds no\u00a0 evidence that the entire\u00a0 capital or any part thereof was\u00a0 lost.\u00a0 It is no evidence of such loss to aver, without proof, that the effects of the store were\u00a0 ejected.\u00a0\u00a0 Even though this were proven, it could not be inferred therefrom that the ejectment was due to the fact\u00a0 that no rents were paid,\u00a0 and that the rent was not paid on\u00a0 account of the\u00a0 loss of\u00a0 the capital belonging to the enterprise.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the possible profits, the\u00a0 findings\u00a0 of the court below are based on the statements of the defendant Ong Pong Co, to the effect that \"there were some profits, but not\u00a0 large ones.\"\u00a0 This court,\u00a0 however, does\u00a0 not find that the amount\u00a0 thereof has\u00a0 been proven, nor\u00a0 deem\u00a0 it possible\u00a0 to estimate them to be a\u00a0 certain sum, and for a given period of\u00a0 time; hence, it can not admit the estimate, made in the judgment, of 12 per\u00a0 cent per annum for the period of six months.<br\/><br\/>Inasmuch as in this case nothing appears other\u00a0 than the failure to fulfill an obligation on the part of a partner who acted as agent in receiving money\u00a0 for a given purpose, for which he has rendered no accounting, such agent is responsible only for the losses which, by a violation of\u00a0 the\u00a0 provisions of the law,\u00a0 he incurred.\u00a0 This being an obligation to pay\u00a0 in cash, there are no\u00a0 other losses than the legal interest, which interest is not due\u00a0 except from the time of the judicial\u00a0 demand,\u00a0 or,\u00a0 in the\u00a0 present\u00a0 case, from the filing of the complaint.\u00a0 (Arts. 1108 and\u00a0 1100, Civil Code.) We do not consider that\u00a0 article 1688 is\u00a0 applicable in this case, in so far as it provides \"that the partnership is liable to every partner for the amounts he may\u00a0 have disbursed on account of the same and\u00a0 for the proper\u00a0 interest,\" for the reason that no other money than that contributed as capital is involved.<br\/><br\/>As\u00a0 in the partnership there were two\u00a0 administrators or. agents liable for the above-named amount, article 1138 of the Civil Code has been\u00a0 properly applied,\u00a0 and article 1698 might also have been invoked; this latter\u00a0 deals with debts of\u00a0 a partnership where\u00a0 the obligation\u00a0 is\u00a0 not a joint one, as\u00a0 is likewise\u00a0 provided by\u00a0 article 1723\u00a0 of said code with respect to the liability of two or more agents with respect to the return of the money that they receive from their principal.\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, the other errors\u00a0 assigned have not been committed.<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing,\u00a0 the judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed, provided,\u00a0 however, that the\u00a0 defendant Ong Pong Co shall only\u00a0 pay the plaintiff the sum of P750 with the legal interest thereon at\u00a0 the rate\u00a0 of 6 per cent per annum from the time of the filing of the complaint, and the\u00a0 costs, without\u00a0 special ruling as\u00a0 to\u00a0 the\u00a0 costs of\u00a0 this instance.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Johnson,\u00a0 Carson,<\/i> and <i>Moreland, JJ.,<\/i> concur.<br\/><\/div>",

from the said judgment the defendant has appealed and submitted his bill of exceptions to this court.<br\/><br\/>Upon appeal it now appears that the following error has been assigned:<br\/><blockquote>\"The court below erred in maintaining that the plaintiff had acquired the exclusive\u00a0 right to the use of the word 'Paz' in his trade name\u00a0 as against any other person on the same\u00a0 street by reason of the long time\u00a0 he had used said word, and\u00a0 by virtue of the recording of the same in the registry of trade-marks and\u00a0 trade-names, it appearing that 'Paz' is the name of the street where the undertaker's establishment is located.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In support of the above assignment of error, section 2 of Act No. 666 of the Philippine Commission is especially relied upon, in connection with its\u00a0 proviso, which is of the following tenor:<br\/><blockquote>\"<i>Provided<\/i>, That a designation or part\u00a0 of a designation which relates only to the name, quality, or description\u00a0 of the merchandise or geographical place\u00a0 of its production\u00a0 or origin can not be the subject of a trade-mark.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In accordance with the above provision, the defendant can not be prevented from using the word \"Funeraria,\" a generic name of the trade,\u00a0 and\u00a0 it was so\u00a0 admitted at the trial; but as to the name \"Paz,\" it does not appear that it is a \"geographical name of the place of production or origin of an article,\" as in the examples of names rejected in the decisions cited\u00a0 by the appellant, such\u00a0 as\u00a0 \"Pennsylvania wheat,\"\u00a0 \"Kentucky hemp,\" \"Virginia tobacco,\" \"Sea-island cotton,\"\u00a0 etc.<br\/><br\/>\"Paz\" is a name which has been used\u00a0 by the plaintiff to designate his establishment, not necessarily taken from the name of the street on which it is situated at the present time, since the name of \"Paz\" was in use when the establishment was located on the Calzada de Bilibid; and while located at the latter place he registered\u00a0 the name and the place became so known in his business papers (Exhibits B and C); the word \"Paz\" is also applied to\u00a0 his establishments situated on Calle Ilaya in Tondo,\u00a0 and\u00a0 on Calle Alix in Sampaloc, and is still so used.<br\/><br\/>The following findings of\u00a0 fact are\u00a0 contained in the judgment appealed from:\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 That the words \"La Nueva\" appear on the sign of the establishment of the defendant, with letters one span in width, and the words \"Funeraria Paz\" in letters of more than double the size, and identical with those on the sign of the plaintiff's establishment; (2) that the defendant opened his establishment in the place that was formerly occupied by the plaintiff; and (3) that the defendant, according to his own declaration, had fixed lower rates than those charged by the plaintiff for the services of his establishment.<br\/><br\/>From all of the foregoing conclusions, the trial court concluded that the use of the words \"Funeraria Paz\" answered no other\u00a0 purpose than that of making it easy to mistake the defendant's establishment\u00a0 for that of the plaintiff formerly located in the same place, or so that it might be considered as its successor; that the addition of \"La Nueva\" was nothing more than a trick employed by the defendant in order to covertly appropriate the trade name of the plaintiff; that the very fact of adding \"La Nueva\" to the prominent words \"Funeraria Paz\" on the sign shows how fully convinced he was that, without such an addition,\u00a0 he could not\u00a0 use the said sign which he now considers as a \"generic name of the place of production or origin\" referred to in said Act No. 666; that the lowering of rates, together with all the circumstances set forth, tended to establish a competition in bad faith; and that the results are as shown by the defendant in his claim for damages by reason of the preliminary injunction, which prevented him from obtaining such beneficial results.<br\/><br\/>In this instance the defendant insists that the plaintiff should be adjudged to pay him P2,000, by reason of the said preliminary injunction, without any express assignment of error against the judgment which naturally did not grant him an\u00a0 indemnity for the damages claimed by him.<br\/><br\/>His claim is stated as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"It has been shown at the trial by the books of the defendant that, from the 8th to the 24th of January, a period of sixteen days, the collections amounted to P380 Philippine currency; and from January 24, to\u00a0 the day when he testified, February 1,\u00a0 the collections only amounted to\u00a0 F39. Said difference is\u00a0 due to the fact that the defendant had extensively advertised his business under the former name, and because of the injunction he was obliged to commence the business under another name, thus losing the benefit of his advertisements.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Brief, 10.)<br\/><br\/>\"Hence, the word Tax' - as concluded in the\u00a0 judgment appealed from - added to the word 'Funeraria' on the sign of the\u00a0 defendant's establishment, although preceded by the words\u00a0 'La Nueva,' is what attracted clients, to the establishment, and not the lower rates charged for services.\"\u00a0 (B. of E., 14.)<\/blockquote>In view of the fact that the only error assigned\u00a0 by the appellant has not been proven, the judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed with the costs of this instance against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Johnson, Carson,<\/i> and <i>Moreland, JJ.,<\/i> concur.<br\/><\/div>",

The plaintiff accordingly prayed that, after due process of law, judgment be rendered against the defendants by ordering them to close up or fill in the openings they had made in his lot, and to abstain perpetually from repeating the acts which are the subject of the complaint; and that they be sentenced to pay damages and costs.<br\/><br\/>The four defendants having been summoned, set forth in their written answer to the foregoing complaint, on January 4, 1905, that they denied the first charge therein made, as well as the serious detriment referred to in the second charge in connection with the said ditch. They alleged that the land concerned belonged exclusively to the spouses Andres Lazo and Marcela Tamano, residents of Bacarra, who acquired the same by purchase, through the execution of an instrument, from its former owners, Antero Subia, Cirila Tumacder, Maria Tumacder, Lucas Aquiat, Simplicio Quebral, and Exequiel Tumacder; that the said spouses, the vendees and owners of the land, entered into an agreement with the company of ditchers of Cabulalaan, organized by the defendants, whereby the said company was to open the ditch referred to in the complaint, for the purpose of converting the land into a rice plantation; that by virtue of the agreement mentioned, the defendants opened the said ditch, the owner Lazo first having notified all his tenants on shares, among them the plaintiff, to remove their houses that were built on the land to other land in Libong adjacent to that owned by the said Lazo; that this notice was complied with by nearly all of the latter, except the plaintiff, who, abusing the kindness and confidence of the owners of the property, not only wished to usurp the land on which his house was built, but also the lands occupied by his cotenants and the land belonging to the spouses Lazo and Tamano, where there was no house at all. The defendants therefore prayed that in due course of time judgment be rendered in their favor by denying the final injunction solicited by the plaintiff, and that the costs be charged against the latter.<br\/><br\/>The case having come up for trial and testimony having been adduced by both parties, the documents exhibited by the defendants being attached to the record, the court, on September 1, 1905, pronounced judgment denying the remedy sought in the complaint and taxed the costs against the plaintiff who, on being notified of the result, stated that he excepted to the said judgment and signified his intention to forward through the regular channel a bill of exceptions, which was filed, approved and transmitted to the clerk of this court.<br\/><br\/>This litigation was initiated by virtue of the remedy known as permanent injunction, sought by the plaintiff Tumacder as possessor under title of ownership, to the end that the defendants be prohibited from continuing to excavate a part of his land to form therein a ditch, to the serious detriment of his interests, and be further compelled to close or fill in the opening they had made in his said lot.<br\/><br\/>To settle the question at issue, it is necessary to decide whether he who seeks the remedy has or has not a right to object to the act which is the cause of the complaint.<br\/><br\/>Section 171 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"If upon the final trial of the action it shall appear that the plaintiff is entitled to an injunction perpetually restraining the commission or continuance of the act complained of, the court shall grant a final injunction perpetually restraining the defendant from continuing the act.\"<\/blockquote>The defendants in their answer to the complaint, after a denial of the grounds in support thereof, alleged that they proceeded to open the said ditch by the order of their masters, Andres Lazo and Marcela Tamayo, of whom the defendants were mere tenants on shares, as was also the plaintiff himself; that, for the purpose of performing the work, the tenants who occupied the place through which the ditch was to pass had to remove their dwellings to another locality designated by the owners, and that the plaintiff was the only one who refused to do so and was usurping the lot occupied by his house and the lots of others of his cotenants.<br\/><br\/>The judge, in view of the pleadings and proofs by both parties, found the fact to be established that Andres Lazo and his wife acquired the land concerned from various owners, among them Exequiel Tumacder, the father of the plaintiff, and that therefore the latter had no right to the property, as it had already been transferred by his father. On this ground the court denied the final injunction prayed for by the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>The appeal raised by the latter having been admitted and no motion having been made in first instance for a new trial, this court will only determine the issues of law involved in the said appeal. It would be improper to review the judgment with respect to the facts and the evidence adduced at trial. In case No. 4322 (Martinez <i>vs.<\/i> Campbell et al., 10 Phil. Rep., 626) the following doctrine was established:<br\/><blockquote>\"When a motion for a new trial has not been made, the statement of facts set forth as proven in the judgment appealed from must be accepted. This court has no jurisdiction to review the same upon appeal, but is only called upon to resolve questions of law set up by the appellant.\"<\/blockquote>For the foregoing reasons, and because the judgment appealed from is in accordance with law, it is proper, in our opinion, to affirm as we do hereby affirm the same, with the costs against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Villareal, and Encarnacion, Jose, and Amparo Lopez y Jaucian brought suit against\u00a0 Adolfo\u00a0 Olbes, the testamentary executor of the deceased Martina\u00a0 Lopez, alleging in their complaint that the latter,\u00a0 on the\u00a0 14th of May,\u00a0 1907,\u00a0 executed a public instrument before the notary Felix Samson whereby she donated to the plaintiffs a parcel of hemp land situated at the place called Ali, in the pueblo of Guinobatan, Albay, containing an area\u00a0 of 162\u00a0 hectares, 2 ares, and 50 centares, the boundaries of which are expressed in the said instrument; that this property was inscribed in the registry of property of\u00a0 Albay in the name\u00a0 of the deceased Antonio Lopez, the predecessor in interest of the said Martina Lopez, also deceased; that, by virtue of the said donation, Ricardo Lopez was entitled to\u00a0 the usufruct of the\u00a0 real property concerned, and that the other plaintiffs, Josefina,\u00a0 Encarnacion, Jose, and Amparo, all\u00a0 surnamed Lopez y Jaucian, were the equal owners thereof in fee simple; that on\u00a0 the same date, May 14,\u00a0 1907, the said\u00a0 donation was accepted by Ricardo Lopez on his own behalf and in representation of the minor children above designated,\u00a0 and the donor, Martina Lopez, on the\u00a0 same date, was duly notified of the said acceptance; that\u00a0 the said Martina Lopez\u00a0 was the legitimate mother of the\u00a0 plaintiff Ricardo Lopez, and the other\u00a0 plaintiffs, Josefina,\u00a0 Encarnacion, Jose,\u00a0 and Amparo,\u00a0 the legitimate children of Ricardo Lopez, were her legitimate grandchildren; that\u00a0 Adolfo Olbes was\u00a0 the testamentary executor duly appointed by order issued by the\u00a0 Court of\u00a0 First Instance, on April 22, 1908, in proceedings No. 918, entitled: In the matter of the estate\u00a0 of the deceased Martina Lopez; that the said Olbes, as executor, claimed to have rights of ownership and\u00a0 possession to the aforementioned land adverse to those then held by the plaintiffs, inasmuch as the said estate still continued to belong to the deceased Martina Lopez and was then in charge of a trustee\u00a0 by virtue of an agreement had between the\u00a0 attorneys of the executor and the plaintiff Ricardo Lopez,\u00a0 on April 18, and of the order issued by the court on the same date in the aforesaid probate proceedings; and the\u00a0 complaint concluded\u00a0 by asking that a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i> be appointed, who should be the said Ricardo Lopez, to represent his minor children, also plaintiffs; that\u00a0 judgment be rendered in the latter's favor and against the defendant for the ownership and possession of the said land, and that the\u00a0 trusteeship over the same be declared dissolved and the trustee be ordered to\u00a0 render an accounting, and\u00a0 that\u00a0 the amounts or\u00a0 products\u00a0 which\u00a0 he might have in his possession be adjudicated to the plaintiffs, with the costs against the defendant.<br\/><br\/>The defendant, having\u00a0 been summoned, filed a demurrer in writing, on November 23, 1908, alleging that the facts set forth\u00a0 in the complaint did\u00a0 not\u00a0 constitute a right of action,\u00a0 inasmuch as the plaintiffs, as the heirs or donees, could not maintain any suit against\u00a0 the\u00a0 testamentary executor to recover the title or possession of the land so long as the court had not adjudicated the estate to them or until the time allowed for paying the debts should have expired, unless they be given\u00a0 possession of the said land by the executor.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the plaintiffs, in answer to the demurrer, set forth that\u00a0 the terms of section\u00a0 704\u00a0 of the Code of Civil Procedure\u00a0 do not comprise\u00a0 donees,\u00a0 but\u00a0 merely\u00a0 heirs\u00a0 or devisees, because, although in the first part\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 said section the word <i>donatario<\/i> (donee) appears, the subsequent paragraphs contain\u00a0 only\u00a0 the words\u00a0 <i>heredero o legatario<\/i> (heir or devisee), it appearing to be evident that the Spanish translation of the said section is not correct; the English text thereof is given wherein the\u00a0 word \"donee\"\u00a0 does not appear, only the words \"heir\" and \"devisee,\" which mean <i> heredero<\/i> and <i>legatario<\/i>; this is apparently confirmed by the precedents of existing legislation, quoted\u00a0 by counsel, and therefore the prohibition contained in the aforesaid section of the\u00a0 Code of CiviJ Procedure only refers to the\u00a0 heir or devisee, and in nowise to the donee, whose title is\u00a0 derived from a donation <i>inter vivos<\/i>, the legal effects of which are those of a real contract which is binding on the donor from the moment of its acceptance; that the\u00a0 donations which are to\u00a0 become effective\u00a0 <i>inter vivos<\/i> are governed\u00a0 by the provisions concerning contracts and obligations (art. 621, Civil Code), and that the rule\u00a0 that the plaintiffs' right can not be enforced in an ordinary action, but in probate proceedings\u00a0 only, solely refers\u00a0 to the questions\u00a0 involving the status of heirs and their share in the\u00a0 inheritance and not to that class of actions\u00a0 provided for in section 699 of the Code of Civil Procedure, counsel citing decisions rendered in suits against testamentary executors or administrators, as the\u00a0 case of Hijos\u00a0 de\u00a0 I.\u00a0 de\u00a0 la Rama <i>vs. <\/i>The Estate of Benedicto (5 Phil. Rep., 512),\u00a0 and that of Sunico <i>vs.<\/i> Chuidian (9 Phil. Rep., 625); and for all the foregoing reasons the plaintiffs requested that the demurrer interposed by the defendant be dismissed and\u00a0 that he be ordered to answer the complaint within the period allowed by law.<br\/><br\/>The demurrer having been heard, the judge, on February 26, 1909,\u00a0 issued an order sustaining the said demurrer and directing that the same, as an incidental proceeding, be attached\u00a0 to the\u00a0 record of the probate\u00a0 proceedings\u00a0 of the deceased Martina Lopez.<br\/><br\/>By virtue of the petition presented by the plaintiffs asking for final judgment and the\u00a0 appointment of Ricardo Lopez as guardian <i>ad litem<\/i> of the other plaintiff minors, the judge issued an order on March 6,\u00a0 1909, amending the preceding one by admitting the demurrer authorizing the plaintiff to amend his complaint,\u00a0 with the understanding that\u00a0 should he not file an amended complaint within the\u00a0 time allowed by law the case would be dismissed, with the\u00a0 costs against the plaintiff; this order was attached to the record of the said probate proceedings,\u00a0 and he appointed Ricardo Lopez guardian <i>ad litem<\/i> to represent the minor plaintiffs in the litigation.<br\/><br\/>On March 9, 1909, the plaintiffs filed a written amended complaint, a reproduction of the previous one, although this was done by\u00a0 Ricardo Lopez on\u00a0 his own\u00a0 behalf and\u00a0 in representation of his minor children, also plaintiffs, as their guardian <i>ad\u00a0 litem, <\/i>and by Ceferino M.\u00a0 Villareal as the husband of the plaintiff Josefina Lopez.<br\/><br\/>The defendant, being informed of the foregoing amended complaint, again demurred to the same\u00a0 on the\u00a0 grounds that the facts\u00a0 therein alleged did not constitute a\u00a0 right of action, inasmuch as in the amended complaint, which is a reproduction of the previous one, no new allegation was made that might supply the deficiency of right of action\u00a0 on the\u00a0 part\u00a0 of\u00a0 the plaintiffs\u00a0 in their endeavor\u00a0 to obtain\u00a0 a reversal of the judgment rendered, without employing legal remedies\u00a0 against the order of March 6; wherefore the defendant prayed the court\u00a0 to allow\u00a0 this\u00a0 new demurrer,\u00a0 to dismiss the amended complaint, and to adjudge the plaintiffs to pay the costs.<br\/><br\/>The hearing\u00a0 on this demurrer having been had, the judge, by order\u00a0 of March 24, 1909, sustained the same\u00a0 and dismissed the case\u00a0 with the costs against the plaintiffs, and provided\u00a0 that\u00a0 this question should be\u00a0 determined in the hearing on the\u00a0 said probate proceedings.<br\/><br\/>In another document of the date of March 26, 1909, counsel for the plaintiffs stated to the court that the latter desired to appeal from the said ruling to the Supreme Court, and\u00a0 prayed that final judgment be rendered in the case\u00a0 in conformity with section 101 of the Code of Civil Procedure and\u00a0 the doctrine established in\u00a0 the case\u00a0 of Serrano <i>vs.<\/i> Serrano (9 Phil. Rep., 142), in order that he might perfect and\u00a0 duly submit his appeal; but the court, by an order of the 27th of the\u00a0 same\u00a0 month, ruled that the case\u00a0 having been dismissed, with the costs against the plaintiffs, in the ruling on the last demurrer of March 24, this decision was final\u00a0 and appealable.\u00a0\u00a0 From this ruling1 counsel\u00a0 for the plaintiffs appealed and stated in writing that the latter also appealed from the rulings of February 26 and\u00a0 March 24, 1909, and announced their intention to file the requisite bill of exceptions.<br\/><br\/>The court, by order of May 8, 1909, on the grounds therein set forth and in view of plaintiffs' written petition of March 26, rendered judgment against the plaintiffs and in favor\u00a0 of the\u00a0 defendant, and, finding that the allegations made in the complaint\u00a0 were not sufficient to\u00a0 constitute an action, dismissed the complaint with the costs against the plaintiffs, and ordered, moreover, that after the parties had been notified of this judgment a copy thereof, as an integral part of the bill of exceptions submitted, be\u00a0 forwarded to the Supreme Court.<br\/><br\/>This is a\u00a0 question of maintaining the rights acquired by the plaintiffs by virtue\u00a0 of a donation of land\u00a0 situated at the place called Ali, in\u00a0 the\u00a0 pueblo\u00a0 of Guinobatan, Albay, the boundaries\u00a0 of\u00a0 which are expressed in the\u00a0 complaint, against the claims of the testamentary administrator of the property left by the late Martina Lopez, who was the donor of the said land.<br\/><br\/>Although\u00a0 in paragraph No. 5 of the amended complaint the donees affirm that they took possession of the land in question, it\u00a0 is certain that the executor, who claims to have rights as such to the possession of the said land, succeeded in having the same placed in trust, inasmuch\u00a0 as\u00a0 one of the petitions of\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiffs is to request that the trusteeship over the property be declared dissolved.\u00a0 The\u00a0 Civil\u00a0 Code provides as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Art. 618.

Villareal, in their character of donees, is\u00a0 based on the rights which as such donees they had\u00a0 acquired by virtue of the donation <i>inter vivos<\/i> made by Martina Lopez during her lifetime in favor of the plaintiffs by an instrument executed by the donor before a notary on\u00a0 May 14, 1907, a donation expressly accepted on the same date by the donees and of which acceptance the donor was\u00a0 also informed on the\u00a0 same date; wherefore,\u00a0 these requirements of the law having been\u00a0 complied with, it is unquestionable that the dominion over the land\u00a0 donated was properly transmitted to the donees who in fact and by operation of the law acquired the ownership of the property, as customarily\u00a0 occurs in all contracts of transfer of dominion.<br\/><br\/>The said action with its motive and grounds may be impugned for any reason\u00a0 based\u00a0 on the\u00a0 nullity or on the irregular\u00a0 nature of the donation, tending to\u00a0 make it inefficacious or to reduce it; but these exceptions, as well as those founded on some defect or vice,\u00a0 which affect the essential nature and formalities of the act or contract or the main questions relative thereto,\u00a0 must be heard and argued in an ordinary action, and must be decided in accordance with law by a final judgment, and not by a ruling on a demurrer which ordinarily occurs in connection with an incidental motion concerning mere formalities of procedure and not in a full trial or due process of law wherein the rights of the contestants have been examined,\u00a0 argued, and proved.<br\/><br\/>Property of the\u00a0 testate estate of the deceased Martina Lopez is not here concerned.\u00a0\u00a0 During her lifetime she gave away the land mentioned, in\u00a0 the exercise of a right\u00a0 that pertained to her as\u00a0 owner thereof.\u00a0 By virtue of the said donation the sole and true owners of the land\u00a0 donated are the plaintiffs,\u00a0 so long as the said donation is not proven to be null, inefficacious, or irregular.\u00a0 All the questions which by reason of the same are raised by the interested parties must be heard in a regular trial and decided by a final judgment absolutely independent of the probate proceedings concerning the estate of the deceased, who was the\u00a0 previous owner of the land concerned; and therefore\u00a0 the complaint of the donees should not have been dismissed, but the trial should have been proceeded with to final judgment.\u00a0 The <i>prima facie<\/i> donation <i>inter vivos<\/i> and its acceptance by the donees having been proved by means of a public instrument, and the donor having been duly notified of said acceptance, the contract is perfect and obligatory and it is perfectly in order to demand its fulfillment, unless an exception is proved which is based on some legal reason opportunely alleged by the donor or her heirs.<br\/><br\/>So long as the donation in question has not been judicially proved and declared to be null, inefficacious, or irregular, the land donated is of the absolute ownership of the donees and, consequently, does not form a part of the property of the estate of the deceased\u00a0 Martina Lopez;\u00a0 wherefore the action instituted demanding compliance with the contract, the delivery by the deforciant of the land donated, or that it be prohibited to disturb the right of the donees, should not be considered as incidental to the probate proceedings aforementioned.<br\/><br\/>The question as to whether the provisions of articles 634, 636, and\u00a0 643 of\u00a0 the Civil Code were observed or violated should be tried and decided in an ordinary action.<br\/><br\/>With respect to whether the donees <i>inter vivos<\/i> are or are not comprised within the provisions of section 704 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the English text of the said section, which, in case of disagreement\u00a0 with the\u00a0 Spanish, is\u00a0 the one that must prevail and be observed, in accordance with Act\u00a0 No.\u00a0 63\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 Philippine\u00a0 Commission, conclusively proves that an important mistake was made in the draft of the Spanish text, by using the word <i>donatario<\/i> (donee), which\u00a0 is not expressed in the English text,\u00a0 the exact translation\u00a0 of which into Spanish could not comprise the donee among the heirs and\u00a0 devisees, as was improperly done; wherefore the\u00a0 demurrer should\u00a0 have been\u00a0 overruled, as it is based on an error so notably unmaintainable under the general principles of law,\u00a0 and in particular taking\u00a0 into account the legal provisions relative\u00a0 to the respective character, condition,\u00a0 and juridical conception of heir, devisee, and donee.<br\/><br\/>For\u00a0 the foregoing\u00a0 reasons, we hold\u00a0 that\u00a0 the orders of February 26, March 6, 24, and 27, together with the additional\u00a0 order\u00a0 of\u00a0 May 8,\u00a0 1909,\u00a0 should be and are\u00a0 hereby revoked, and the case shall be returned to the Court of First Instance\u00a0\u00a0 in order\u00a0 that\u00a0 the defendant\u00a0 may answer\u00a0 the amended complaint within the regular legal period and the trial may then be had in all its proceedings and in accordance with law.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Johnson, Carson,<\/i> and<i> Moreland, JJ<\/i>., concur.<\/div>",

Sections 1 and 2 of Law No. 1411 read as follows:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"Section 1. The exportation from the Philippine Islands of Philippine silver coins, coined by authority of the Act of Congress approved March 2, 1903 (32 Stat. at L., 952, chap. 980, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp., 1909, p. 893), or of bullion made by melting or otherwise mutilating such coins, is hereby prohibited, and any of the aforementioned silver coins or bullion which is exported, or of which the exportation is attempted subsequent to the passage of this Act, and contrary to its provisions, shall be liable to forfeiture, under due process of law, and one third of the sum or value of the bullion so forfeited shall be payable to the person upon whose information, given to the proper authorities, the seizure of the money or bullion so forfeited is made, and the other two-thirds shall be payable to the Philippine Government, and accrue to the gold standard fund. Provided, that the prohibition herein contained shall not apply to sums of twenty-five pesos or less, carried by passengers leaving the Philippine Islands.<\/p><p>\"SEC. 2. The exportation or the attempt to export Philippine silver coins or bullion made from such coins from the Philippine Islands, contrary to law, is hereby declared to be a criminal offense, punishable, in addition to the forfeiture of the said coins or bullion, as above provided, by a fine not to exceed ten thousand pesos, or by imprisonment for a period not to exceed one year, or both, in the discretion of the court.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>We may pass over the assignments of error which challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to warrant a conviction, inasmuch as it is not contended that there was no evidence. This is a writ of error, and upon such a writ the error to be considered must be confined to error of law.<\/p><p>The substantial question is as to whether a law which prohibits the exportation of Philippine silver coin from the Philippine Islands is a law which deprives the owner of his property in such coins without due process of law, in violation of that prohibition of the Organic Act of July 1, 1902, which provides that \"no law shall be enacted in said islands which shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.\" 32 Stat. at L., 692, chap. 1369. The authority for the law is found in the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902, \u00a7\u00a7 76 et seq., 32 Stat. at L., 691, 710, chap. 1369, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp., 1909, p. 890, which authorized the Philippine Government to establish a mint in the city of Manila for coinage purposes and to enact laws for its operation, and for the striking of certain coins. By the later Act of Congress of March 2, 1903 (chap. 980, 32 Stat. at L., 952, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp., 1909, p. 893), it was provided that the gold peso, consisting of 12.9 grains of gold, nine-tenths fine, should<br\/>\u00a0 be the unit of value in the Islands. The second section of that act provided as follows:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"That in addition to the coinage authorized for use in the Philippine Islands by the Act of July first, nineteen hundred and two, entitled, An Act temporarily to provide for the administration of the affairs of civil Government in the Philippine Islands, and for other purposes,\" the Government of the Philippine islands is authorized to coin to an amount not exceeding seventy-five million pesos, for use in said islands, a silver coin of the denomination of one peso, and of the weight of four hundred and sixteen grains, and the standard of said silver coins shall be such that of one thousand parts by&gt; weight, nine hundred shall be of pure metal and one hundred of alloy, and the alloy shall be of copper.\" <\/p><\/blockquote><p>Section 6 of the same Act of March 2, 1903, provided:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"That the coinage authorized by this Act shall be subject to the conditions and limitations of the provisions of the Act of July first, nineteen hundred and two, entitled, 'An Act temporarily to provide for the administration of the affairs of Civil Government, in the Philippine Islands, and for other purposes,' except as herein otherwise provided; and the Government of the Philippine Islands may adopt such measures as it may deem proper, not inconsistent with said Act of July first, nineteen hundred and two, to maintain the value of the silver Philippine peso at the rate of one gold peso.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>In a subsequent part of the same section, the issuance of certificates of indebtedness, bearing interest, was authorized as a specific measure for maintaining the parity between the silver and gold peso.<\/p><p>The law of the Philippine Commission, above set out, under which the conviction of the plaintiff in error was secured, must rest upon the provision of section 6, above set out, as a means of maintaining \"the value of the silver peso at the rate of one gold peso.\" Passing by any consideration of the wisdom of such a law prohibiting the exportation of the Philippine Islands silver pesos as not relevant to the question of power, a substantial reason for such a law is indicated by the fact that the bullion value of such coin in Hongkong was some 9 per cent greater than its face value. The law was therefore adapted to keep the silver pesos in circulation as a medium of exchange in the Islands and at a parity with the gold peso of Philippine mintage.<\/p><p>The power to \"coin money and regulate the value thereof, and of foreign coin,\" is a prerogative of sovereignty and a power of exclusively vested in the Congress of the United States. The power which the Government of the Philippine Islands has in respect to a local coinage is derived from the express Act of Congress. Along with the power to strike gold and silver pesos for local circulation in the islands was granted the power to provide such measures as that government should \"deem proper,\" not inconsistent with the Organic Law of July 1, 1902, necessary to maintain the parity between the gold and silver pesos. Although the Philippine act cannot, therefore, be said to overstep the wide legislative discretion in respect of measures to preserve a parity between the gold and silver pesos, yet it is said that if the particular measure resorted to be one which operates to deprive the owner of silver pesos of the difference between their bullion and coin value, he has had his property taken from him without compensation, and, in its wider sense, without that due process of law guaranteed by the fundamental Act of July, 1902.<\/p><p>Conceding the title of the owner-of such coins, yet there is attached to such ownership those limitations which public policy may require by reason of their quality as a legal tender and as a medium of exchange. These limitations are due to the fact that public law gives to.such coinage a value which does not attach as a mere consequence of intrinsic value. Their quality as a legal tender is an attribute of law aside from their bullion value. They bear, therefore, the impress of sovereign power which fixes value and authorizes their use in exchange. As an incident, government may punish defacement and mutilation, and constitute any such act, when fraudulently done, a misdemeanor. Rev. Stat. sections 5189, U.S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 3484, 3684.<\/p><p> However unwise a law may be, aimed at the exportation of such coins, in the face of the axioms against obstructing the free flow of commerce, there can be no serious doubt but that the power to coin money includes the power to prevent its outflow from the country of its origin. To justify the exercise of such a power it is only necessary that it shall appears that the means are reasonably adapted to conserve the general public interest, and are not an arbitrary interference with private rights of contract or property. The law here in question is plainly within the limits of the police power, and not an arbitrary or unreasonable interference with private rights. If a local coinage was demanded by the general interest of the Philippine Islands, legislation reasonably adequate to maintain such coinage at home as a medium of exchange is not a violation of private right, forbidden by the organic law. Obviously, it the Philippine Government had power to prohibit the exportation or melting of Philippine silver pesos, it had the power to make the violation of the prohibition a misdemeanor. The proceedings for the enforcement of the law included the ordinary process in criminal cases lawful in the islands, and not forbidden by the Act of July, 1992.<\/p><p><em>Judgment affirmed<\/em>.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 <br\/><\/p><hr align=\"LEFT\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/>\u00a0 <sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> 218 U.S., 302; 54 L. ed., 1049. <\/div>",

There is no charge in the said complaint that the said boxes of milk were or\u00a0 had been in\u00a0 the possession or under the control of the defendant.<br\/><br\/>The defendant, in the municipal\u00a0 court,\u00a0 objected to the jurisdiction of that court upon the ground that the\u00a0 penalty provided for the crime charged in the complaint was for a period\u00a0 longer\u00a0 than six months.\u00a0 The municipal court denied the objection and held that it had jurisdiction of the crime charged, and sentenced the defendant to be imprisoned for a period\u00a0 of six months of <i>arresto mayor<\/i>.\u00a0 From that sentence\u00a0 the defendant\u00a0 appealed to the\u00a0 Court of First Instance.\u00a0\u00a0 In the Court of First Instance the defendant contended that the municipal court did not have jurisdiction over the crime charged in\u00a0 said complaint, and that, therefore, the Court of First\u00a0 Instance could not have jurisdiction to try him\u00a0 under the said complaint; that the only question which the Court of First Instance\u00a0 could try in the first instance was whether or not the municipal court had jurisdiction over said crime.<br\/><br\/>Section 40, Act No. 183, of the Philippine Commission, gave to the municipal court of the city of Manila \"exclusive jurisdiction over all criminal\u00a0 cases arising\u00a0 under the ordinances of the city of Manila, <i>and over all\u00a0 criminal cases arising under the penal laws of the Philippine\u00a0 Islands,<\/i> where the offense is committed within\u00a0 the police jurisdiction\u00a0 of the city and their respective\u00a0 districts and <i> the maximum punishment is\u00a0 by\u00a0 imprisonment for not more than\u00a0 six months or a fine of not more than one hundred dollars.\"<\/i><br\/><br\/>Under this provision the municipal court had jurisdiction over crimes provided for under the Penal Code, where the punishment did not\u00a0 exceed six months' imprisonment or a fine of not more than\u00a0 P200, or both.\u00a0 This provision gave the municipal court jurisdiction\u00a0 over the\u00a0 crime\u00a0 of <i>estafa<\/i> when the punishment did not exceed six months' imprisonment and the fine mentioned.<br\/><br\/>Section 10 of Act\u00a0 No.\u00a0 267 provides, among other things, that the municipal courts shall also have <i>concurrent jurisdiction with the Courts\u00a0 of First Instance <\/i>over all criminal cases arising under the laws:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>(<i>a<\/i>)\u00a0 Relating\u00a0 to gambling and the\u00a0 management of lotteries;<br\/><br\/>(<i>b<\/i>)\u00a0 Assaults\u00a0 where the intent to kill is not charged or evident upon the trial;<br\/><br\/>(<i>c<\/i>)\u00a0 Larceny\u00a0 and\u00a0 embezzlement where\u00a0 the\u00a0 amount of money or property stolen or embezzled does not exceed the sum or value of $100 (P200);<br\/><br\/>(<i>d<\/i>)\u00a0 The sale of intoxicating liquors;<br\/><br\/>(<i>e<\/i>)\u00a0 Falsely impersonating an officer;<br\/><br\/>(<i>f)<\/i> Trespassing on government or private property;<br\/><br\/>(<i>g<\/i>)\u00a0 Threatening to take human life.<\/blockquote><br\/><br\/>It will be noted that said\u00a0 section 10\u00a0 did not increase the jurisdiction of the municipal court in cases\u00a0 of estafa unless \"embezzlement\"\u00a0 is <i>estafa<\/i>.\u00a0 Embezzlement is\u00a0 a purely statutory offense and may be defined as the fraudulent appropriation to one's own use of money or goods intrusted to one's care by another; the fraudulent appropriation of property by a person\u00a0 to whom it\u00a0 has been intrusted\u00a0 or\u00a0 into whose hands it has lawfully come.\u00a0 <i>It is distinguished from larceny in the fact that the original taking of the property ivas lawful or was with the consent of the owner.<\/i><br\/><br\/>This\u00a0 court\u00a0 has\u00a0 held, in several cases where\u00a0 a person was charged with the crime of\u00a0 \"embezzlement,\" that ho may be convicted under certain provisions of the Penal Code relating to estafa\u00a0 (paragraph 5,\u00a0 article\u00a0 535)\u00a0 and <i>malversation<\/i>\u00a0 (390-395).\u00a0\u00a0 (U.

Rep., 195.)<br\/><br\/>By these\u00a0 cases\u00a0 it has been\u00a0 decided that the\u00a0 crime of embezzlement is covered by certain provisions of the Penal Code and that whenever the complaint filed in\u00a0 any particular case shows that the defendant has violated those provisions of the Penal Code, he will be convicted and punished in accordance with such provisions, even though the crime be described in the complaint as\u00a0 that\u00a0 of \"embezzlement;\" in other words, the character of the crime will be determined from the facts alleged in\u00a0 the complaint\u00a0 and not\u00a0 by\u00a0 the qualification\u00a0 made in the title to the complaint.\u00a0\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Jeffrey,\u00a0 15 Phil.\u00a0 Rep.,\u00a0 391.)\u00a0 We must examine the complaint then in the present case for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not it describes the crime of \"embezzlement\" or <i>estafa<\/i>.\u00a0 Upon an examination\u00a0 of the complaint we\u00a0 are of the opinion\u00a0 and so hold that it describes the crime of estafa and not\u00a0 of \"embezzlement.\"\u00a0 There is no allegation that\u00a0 the defendant appropriated\u00a0 to his own\u00a0 use\u00a0 goods., wares, merchandise or\u00a0 other things intrusted to his care. There is no allegation that there existed between the owner of the six boxes of\u00a0 milk and the defendant any\u00a0 relation of fidelity relating to said property.<br\/><br\/>By an examination of section 40 of Act No. 183, and comparing it\u00a0 with section 10 of Act No. 267, it will be seen that while in the\u00a0 original\u00a0 Act\u00a0 (No. 183)\u00a0 the municipal court was given original\u00a0 jurisdiction\u00a0 over the crime of <i>estafa<\/i> when the punishment did not exceed six months' imprisonment or a fine of P200, in Act No. 267 it is given concurrent jurisdiction with\u00a0 Courts\u00a0 of First Instance of certain crimes, among which are larceny and embezzlement, where the amount of money or property stolen or embezzled did not exceed the value of P200.\u00a0 While, in our opinion, said Act\u00a0 No. 267 gave the\u00a0 municipal\u00a0 court the\u00a0 right to impose the same penalties which the Court of First Instance might impose for the crimes\u00a0 enumerated in said\u00a0 Act, yet the crime of\u00a0 estafa is not enumerated as one of\u00a0 the crimes over which the municipal court has concurrent jurisdiction except, as has been said above, <i>where the crime of embezzlement\u00a0 constitutes also and\u00a0 at\u00a0 the\u00a0 same time the crime of estafa. <\/i> Section 10 of Act\u00a0 No. 267 did not, therefore, give the municipal court concurrent jurisdiction with the Court of First Instance to try persons charged with the crime of estafa when\u00a0 the penalty was for more than six months, etc., when said crime did not also\u00a0 constitute embezzlement. Our conclusion, therefore, must be, if the foregoing reasoning is correct, that the complaint in the present\u00a0 instance not being a complaint\u00a0 for\u00a0 the crime of embezzlement and the punishment for\u00a0 the crime described in the complain!; being for more than six months (paragraph 2, article 534), the municipal court\u00a0 did\u00a0 not have jurisdiction\u00a0 to try the defendant, and therefore the judgment\u00a0 was null and void. The defendant,\u00a0 before the beginning\u00a0 of the trial in the municipal court, objected to the jurisdiction of that court, and\u00a0 after the decision he appealed to the Court\u00a0 of First Instance and there again objected.\u00a0 His objection in the Court of First Instance was to the effect that the municipal court not having had jurisdiction of the cause, the Court of First Instance had no jurisdiction further than to decide the question\u00a0 whether or not the municipal court\u00a0 had had jurisdiction\u00a0 of the cause.\u00a0 We are of the opinion and so hold that this contention of the defendant is tenable. When a case is commenced in a\u00a0 lower court and\u00a0 that court has no jurisdiction over the cause and\u00a0 an objection\u00a0 on that ground is made in such court, and an appeal is taken to a higher court, the higher court acquires no jurisdiction to try the cause further than to decide <i>first<\/i> whether the lower court\u00a0 really had jurisdiction\u00a0 or not.\u00a0 If the higher court decides correctly that the lower court had jurisdiction of said cause, then it may proceed with the trial of the cause on its merits.\u00a0 In the present case an objection was duly made in the municipal court to its jurisdiction, as well as in the Court of First Instance.\u00a0\u00a0 In this respect the present case differs from the decision\u00a0 of this court in U. S. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>. Ang Suyco (page 92,\u00a0 supra)\u00a0 and the case of Carroll <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>. Judge Paredes (page 94, supra).\u00a0 In neither of these cases was there\u00a0 any\u00a0 objection\u00a0 at any time during the pendency of the action in either of the lower courts.<br\/><br\/>Our conclusions are, therefore:<br\/><br\/>First. That the municipal court has original jurisdiction over the crime of\u00a0 <i>estafa only<\/i> when the punishment does not exceed six months' imprisonment or a fine of P200.<br\/><br\/>Second. That the municipal\u00a0 court does not have <i>concurrent jurisdiction with\u00a0 the\u00a0 Court of\u00a0 First Instance <\/i> over the crime of <i>estafa<\/i> when the punishment exceeds six months' imprisonment or a fine\u00a0 of P200, unless the crime is also \"embezzlement.\"\u00a0\u00a0 Some of the provisions of the Penal Code (paragraph 5, article 535, and articles 390-395) governing the crimes\u00a0 of\u00a0 <i>estafa<\/i> and <i>malversacion<\/i>, also\u00a0 govern\u00a0 the statutory crime of embezzlement.<br\/><br\/>Third. Section\u00a0 10,\u00a0 Act No.\u00a0 267, contains no punishment for the crime of\u00a0 embezzlement and no punishment can be imposed for it unless some provision of\u00a0 the Penal\u00a0 Code or\u00a0 other laws\u00a0 in\u00a0 force\u00a0 in the\u00a0 Philippine\u00a0 Islands can be found\u00a0 governing\u00a0 this statutory offense (embezzlement).<br\/><br\/>Fourth. All of\u00a0 the provisions of the Penal Code relating to <i>estafa<\/i> do not cover embezzlement.\u00a0\u00a0 The word <i>estafa,<\/i> as defined by some\u00a0 of the provisions of the\u00a0 Penal Code, does not cover embezzlement.<br\/><br\/>Fifth. A complaint charging <i>estafa<\/i> does not necessarily include \"embezzlement\" and when it does not, the municipal court does not have jurisdiction if the penalty exceeds six months' imprisonment, etc.\u00a0 The courts have no authority to extend a\u00a0 law beyond its express\u00a0 terms when\u00a0 they are plain and unequivocal.<br\/><br\/>Sixth. The <i>municipal court<\/i> did not have original jurisdiction of the crime charged in the complaint in the present cause, for the\u00a0 reason that the\u00a0 punishment\u00a0 (paragraph 2, article 534) was for more than six months.<br\/><br\/>Seventh. The <i>municipal\u00a0 court<\/i> did not have <i>concurrent jurisdiction<\/i> with the Court of First Instance over the crime charged in the complaint in the present cause, for the reason that the crime described in the complaint did not constitute \"embezzlement.\"<br\/><br\/>Eighth. The defendant duly objected to the jurisdiction in the municipal court,\u00a0 as well as in the Court\u00a0 of First Instance.<br\/><br\/>Ninth. The defendant having objected to the jurisdiction of the municipal court and\u00a0 having appealed to the\u00a0 Court of First Instance upon\u00a0 the ground that the municipal court was without jurisdiction, and there again having objected to the jurisdiction of that court, he was entitled to be heard first upon the question\u00a0 whether or not\u00a0 the municipal court had jurisdiction to impose the sentence under the complaint.<br\/><br\/>Tenth. It being established that the municipal court did not have jurisdiction to impose the penalty under\u00a0 the complaint, then the\u00a0 Court of First Instance had no jurisdiction and the penalty imposed was without authority of law and therefore null.<br\/><br\/>Eleventh.\u00a0 The proceedings in the municipal\u00a0 court being null and void by virtue of the fact that said court had no jurisdiction,\u00a0 the defendant had a right, if the authorities deemed it advisable to prosecute\u00a0 him,\u00a0 to be brought into the Court of First Instance by\u00a0 the usual\u00a0 and ordinary procedure adopted by the law.\u00a0 On his appeal, under proper objection to\u00a0 the jurisdiction, he had a right to have\u00a0 the question decided whether or not the municipal court had jurisdiction.<br\/><br\/>Therefore and for all of the\u00a0 foregoing reasons,\u00a0 it is the judgment of this court that the defendant's petition should be allowed and that he should be at once set at liberty.<br\/><br\/>Without any finding as to costs, it is so ordered.<br\/><br\/><i> Arellano, C.

P. E., or registered-package envelope, must be entered in the transit outgoing local registered\u00a0 matter. The number on the R. P. E., or registered-package envelope, must be entered in 1549, after it has been\u00a0 entered or noted in Form 1553.\u00a0 The\u00a0 R. P. E.\u00a0 is then placed in\u00a0 a pouch, accompanied by a return receipt,\u00a0 Form No. 1556, and is dispatched to the next post-office.\u00a0 The post-office\u00a0 opening this\u00a0 mail pouch, finding therein this R. P. E., signs 1556 and returns it to the office of origin.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>As to the defendant's not fulfilling the duties of his office, the same inspector says:<br\/><blockquote>\"He failed to enter in Form 1553 the alleged\u00a0 dispatch of registered-package envelope No. 6, which contained, according to his record 1549, registered letter No. 8, addressed to Concepcion Salazar at San Jose.\u00a0 No. 8 was put in No. 6, and there is no notation of No. 6 having been dispatched. On July 15 there was dispatched from Culasi\u00a0 registered letter No. 4, and addressed to San Jose, Antique, and also registered package No. 5, addressed to Manila, P. I.\u00a0 Registered package No. 6 was\u00a0 not\u00a0 dispatched from his office, according to the record.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It thus appears from\u00a0 the\u00a0 evidence that the\u00a0 defendant received the letter in question, issued a receipt (Exhibit C), Form No. 1549, upon the stub of which\u00a0 he noted that said letter,\u00a0 which was No. 8, had been\u00a0 sent to its destination\u00a0 in registered package No. 6, but failed to\u00a0 note in Form No. 1553 (Exhibit B) that he had remitted said package No. 6. Under the rules and\u00a0 regulations of the\u00a0 post-office department applicable to his office, he should have noted upon the stub of Form\u00a0 No.\u00a0 1553\u00a0 (Exhibit B)\u00a0 the number\u00a0 of the registered package which contained the letter.\u00a0 Furthermore, according to the receipt for registered packages (Exhibit E),\u00a0 Form No. 1556, it\u00a0 appears that the postmaster of San Jose actually received from the accused, as postmaster at Culasi, only registered packages Nos. 8, 3, 4, and 5.\u00a0 He did not receive No. 6.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 accused claimed upon\u00a0 the\u00a0 trial that the letter\u00a0 in question had been by him inadvertently\u00a0 inclosed in\u00a0 one\u00a0 of the registered packages sent on\u00a0 that day and not in No.\u00a0 6, as previously claimed by him.\u00a0 The reason that he gave for this mistake was that he\u00a0 was extremely busy at the time. For the\u00a0 purpose of corroborating his\u00a0 testimony\u00a0 in\u00a0 this respect, he\u00a0 presented\u00a0 witness Sergio\u00a0 de\u00a0 los Reyes, who testified that he was present when the accused received the letter in question and when he placed it\u00a0 in one of the registered packages.\u00a0 This testimony of these two\u00a0 witnesses is contradicted in several important particulars.\u00a0\u00a0 The post-office inspector testified that when he was investigating the matter in the office of the accused he asked the accused for the letter in question, and the accused answered that probably\u00a0 it had been lost in his office.\u00a0 Upon this subject the court below says:<br\/><blockquote>\"It stands\u00a0 undisputed\u00a0 in this case that Concepcion Salazar never received this\u00a0 registered\u00a0 letter nor\u00a0 the\u00a0 money which it contained.\u00a0 The accused, by his own testimony and that of a clerk in his office, has made an\u00a0 effort to show that through an unintentional mistake on his part this letter must\u00a0 have been put in\u00a0 what\u00a0 was\u00a0 known\u00a0 as registered package No. 4, sent\u00a0 from the\u00a0 office\u00a0 at Culasi on\u00a0 July 15, 1908.\u00a0 However, an\u00a0 examination\u00a0 of\u00a0 the record in connection with the sending of that package and particularly the certification cards sent by the postmaster at San Jose shows that that letter could not have been inclosed in that\u00a0 package. The clerk\u00a0 of the post-office at\u00a0 Culasi testifying on\u00a0 behalf of\u00a0 the defendant has, in the opinion of\u00a0 this court,\u00a0 given such\u00a0 false testimony that he should\u00a0 be prosecuted by the fiscal\u00a0 of this province for perjury.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The evidence of\u00a0 record fully supports\u00a0 the court\u00a0 in\u00a0 the finding of\u00a0 fact included in the\u00a0 above quotation.\u00a0\u00a0 It is\u00a0 undisputed that Concepcion Salazar never received the letter in\u00a0 question nor the\u00a0 money which it contained.\u00a0 It does appear, however, that some two months after the\u00a0 letter in question had\u00a0 been\u00a0 registered, and after\u00a0 a complaint had been\u00a0 made because it had\u00a0 not been duly delivered, the accused, who had ceased to be the postmaster of Culasi, paid over\u00a0 to\u00a0 the father of Concepcion Salazar\u00a0 the P10,\u00a0 the amount that was alleged to have been contained in the said registered letter.<br\/><br\/>Upon the whole record we find the decision of the court below thoroughly sustained by\u00a0 the proofs and the penalty imposed\u00a0 within the provisions of the\u00a0 law.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below is, therefore, affirmed, with the costs against the appellant.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

The\u00a0 lower court erred in holding that the plaintiffs never notified the defendants, in any way, that their employee, Domingo\u00a0 Tim\u00a0 Bun Liu, could sell their merchandise, but could not receive payment for it, and that the defendants never had notice that their business transactions with Domingo Tim\u00a0 Bun Liu\u00a0 were\u00a0 by him as agent or employee of the plaintiffs.<br\/><br\/>Third. The court erred in holding that the plaintiffs accepted payment through Domingo Tim Bun Liu.<br\/><br\/>Fourth. The court erred in holding that \"the defendants having in good faith purchased\u00a0 the goods upon an\u00a0 agreement to pay for them in\u00a0 merchandise of their own, under an agreement with the person from whom they received the goods, to so pay for them,\u00a0 could not be held responsible for the failure of the plaintiffs' employee to deliver to his employers, that which was received in payment.\"<br\/><br\/>Fifth. The court erred in admitting as evidence Exhibit D (1), Exhibit D\u00a0 (2), and Exhibit D (3).<br\/><br\/>Sixth. The court erred in dismissing the plaintiffs' complaint and in deciding in favor of the defendants.<br\/><br\/>Upon\u00a0 these assignments of error the plaintiffs and appellants present three questions:<br\/><br\/>First.\u00a0 Did the\u00a0 defendants\u00a0 purchase directly from the plaintiffs?<br\/><br\/>Second.\u00a0 If not,\u00a0 did the defendants have sufficient\u00a0 notice of Domingo Tim Bun Liu's relations with the plaintiffs to place them on their guard ?<br\/><br\/>Third. If the\u00a0 last is answered affirmatively, then was the payment by\u00a0 the defendants to Domingo Tim\u00a0 Bun Liu, in something other than cash, binding on the plaintiffs?<br\/><br\/>With reference to the first question, \"Did the defendants purchase directly from the plaintiffs?\" there is much conflict in the testimony.\u00a0\u00a0 The lower\u00a0 court answered this question in the negative.\u00a0 It appears that the defendants had been buying merchandise from Domingo Tim Bun Liu\u00a0 for\u00a0 a period covering several months, and paying for said merchandise by selling to Domingo Tim Bun Liu certain merchandise in exchange, and from\u00a0 time to time settling their accounts by\u00a0 the defendants paying to\u00a0 the\u00a0 said Domingo Tim Bun Liu the\u00a0 difference, if\u00a0 any, in his\u00a0 favor, and by Domingo\u00a0 paying to the\u00a0 defendants\u00a0 the difference\u00a0 of the accounts,\u00a0 if there\u00a0 was found to be due them\u00a0 any balance on such settlements.\u00a0 The defendants claim that they had no knowledge or information\u00a0 that the merchandise\u00a0 which they were receiving from Domingo Tim Bun Liu was the merchandise\u00a0 of the\u00a0 plaintiffs.\u00a0\u00a0 This\u00a0\u00a0 contention of the defendants is supported by the fact that during all of the period during which\u00a0 they\u00a0 were doing\u00a0 business with Domingo, their books of account were kept with Domingo Tim Bun\u00a0 Liu, and not with the plaintiffs.\u00a0 The plaintiffs contend that for certain of the merchandise sold by Domingo Tim Bun Liu to the defendants Domingo presented a bill in their favor.\u00a0 In this\u00a0 proof\u00a0 the plaintiffs attempt to establish the fact that the defendants knew that they were dealing with them and not with Domingo Tim Bun Liu.<br\/><br\/>In answer to this contention, the. defendants contend that the only bill\u00a0 Domingo presented to them for merchandise belonging to the plaintiffs was for the purpose of showing that he, Domingo,\u00a0 was charging\u00a0 the defendants\u00a0 for the merchandise in question the same price which he had been obliged to pay to the plaintiffs.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 fact is not\u00a0 disputed that Domingo\u00a0 Tim Bun Liu purchased all or nearly all of the goods which he sold to the defendants, from the plaintiffs.\u00a0 We\u00a0 think a fair preponderance of the evidence shows that the defendants, in their dealings\u00a0 with\u00a0 Domingo Tim Bun\u00a0 Liu,\u00a0 believed that\u00a0 they were dealing with him and not with the plaintiffs.\u00a0 There is no proof that Domingo\u00a0 ever notified the\u00a0 defendants that he was acting as the agent of the plaintiffs.\u00a0 Neither does\u00a0 the proof show that the plaintiffs ever notified the defendants that Domingo Tim Bun\u00a0 Liu was acting as their agent in selling the merchandise\u00a0 in\u00a0 question.\u00a0 It\u00a0 is not disputed\u00a0 that the defendants have paid\u00a0 to Domingo\u00a0 Tim Bun Liu, in full, for all the merchandise which they\u00a0 purchased of him.<br\/><br\/>It being established by a preponderance of the evidence that Domingo Tim Bun Liu acted in his own name in selling the merchandise to the defendants, and that the defendants fully believed that they were dealing with the said Domingo Tim Bun Liu, without any knowledge of the fact that he was\u00a0 the agent of the plaintiffs, and\u00a0 having\u00a0 paid him in full for the merchandise purchased, they are\u00a0 not liable to the plaintiffs,\u00a0 for said\u00a0 merchandise,\u00a0 even though\u00a0 it be admitted that Domingo Tim Bun Liu was in fact the agent of the plaintiffs\u00a0 in\u00a0 selling\u00a0 the merchandise\u00a0 in question. This is true whether the transaction is covered by the provisions of the\u00a0 Civil Code (art.\u00a0 1717) or\u00a0 by the provisions of the Commercial\u00a0 Code (art. 246).\u00a0\u00a0 Said article 1717 provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"When an agent acts in his own name, the principal shall have no action against the\u00a0 persons with whom the agent has contracted, nor the said persons against the principal.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Said article 246 provides that: \"When an agent transacts business in his own name, it shall not be\u00a0 necessary for him to state who is the principal, and\u00a0 he shall be directly liable, as if the business were for his own account, to the persons\u00a0 with whom he transacts the\u00a0 same,\u00a0 said\u00a0 persons not having any right of action against the principal, nor the latter against the former, the liabilities of the principal and the agent to each other always reserved.\"<br\/><br\/>(Castle Brothers, Wolf &amp;\u00a0 Sons<i> vs.<\/i> Go Juno, 7 Phil.

He appealed.<\/p> <p>Some question has been raised in this court as to the right of the appellant to appeal in a case of this character. We are of the opinion, however, that an appeal ought to lie. One of the main elements necessarily involved in any crime is the identity of the person tried with the person who committed the crime. If that identity remains unestablished, the case against him necessarily falls. While this appellant was not tried for murder, in the strict sense, in the proceeding in which this appeal is taken, it, nevertheless, amounts substantially to that. If he is not the person that he is alleged by the prosecution to be, then he is not the murderer. If he is the person whom the prosecution claims him to be, then he is guilty of murder and must be hanged. The appellant's life is involved. He is entitled to the same defenses, to the same remedies, to the same rights in this proceeding that he would have if this appeal had been made in the cause wherein he was tried for murder. While the trial of identity separate and apart from the main cause is unusual, it is necessary in cases of this character. The issue involved is so vital and important that in its passage through the courts the rights of the accused should be guarded and protected with the same care which they would have received in the principal case.<\/p> <p>We are of the opinion that the judgment of the Court of First Instance, identifying the defendant as Bernabe Santos, the convicted murderer, must be affirmed. It is fully and clearly sustained by the proofs.<\/p> <p>The Hon. W. A. Kincaid, who was the judge presiding in the Court of First Instance during the trial of Bernabe Santos, was presented as a witness for the prosecution in this proceeding, and, after a careful examination and inspection of the appellant as he stood in court, testified that he was the identical person whom he had tried for the murder of Lorenzo Laopoco and sentenced to death upon his judgment of conviction.<\/p> <p>Jose Crame, who was captain of police in the year 1901, and who was a witness for the prosecution against Bernabe Santos in his trial for the murder of Lorenzo Laopoco and who was the person who arrested him, testified that he clearly and without difficulty recognized the appellant as the convicted murderer. He testified that he had had him in his custody for several months during the year 1901 and that he knew him and his appearance well.<\/p> <p>Anastasio Carmona, another witness for the prosecution, testified that he was a companion of the appellant during his imprisonment in 1901 for a period of about two months and up to the time when Bernabe Santos effected his escape. He testified that he was sure that the appellant in this case is the Bernabe Santos who was in prison with him, under sentence of death, in the Parian police station in the city of Manila in 1901.<\/p> <p>Jose Fernandez, a sergeant of police of Paco, city of Manila, in the year 1901, testified that he was the custodian of Bernabe Santos for about two months before his trial in the year 1901, and that after his conviction he conducted him to prison. He had no hesitation in testifying that he recognized the appellant as Bernabe Santos, convicted of the murder of Lorenzo Laopoco in the year 1901.<\/p> <p>Several other witnesses testified to the same effect.<\/p> <p>The evidence introduced by the accused in his behalf leaves the evidence of the prosecution substantially unmet. The testimony of the defense consisted very largely of expert testimony presented by Miguel Zaragoza and Rafael Enriquez, both professors in the College of Fine Arts of the Philippine University. Their testimony consisted of a comparison of the acknowledged genuine photograph of Bernabe Santos with the appellant in this case and the disclosure of distinctions and differences which indicated that the appellant was not Bernabe Santos. Giving that testimony all the weight to which it is entitled, we do not think that it is sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt against the strength of the testimony introduced by the prosecution.<\/p> <p>There remaining in our minds no doubt whatever of the identity of this appellant with Bernabe Santos, the convicted murderer, we have no hesitation in affirming the judgment of the court below and of ordering the appellant remanded into the custody of the proper officials for the execution of the sentence enunciated upon the judgment of conviction entered in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila in the year 1901. So ordered.<\/p> <p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Johnson,<\/em> and <em>Carson, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<\/p><\/div>",

Both courts below decided for the government, the defendant, upon demurrer to the complaint. Abridged, the allegations are these: A contract for the work was made on July 24, 1905. On May 1, 1906, about 200 feet of bulkhead and rock revetment were displaced by pressure from the inside fill and moved about 20 feet into the bay of Manila, so that a large quantity of the fill that had been pumped behind the bulkhead escaped into the bay. On May 18, before the break could be repaired, a severe typhoon occurred, and the bulkhead and rock revetment, being without the support of the inside fill, were destroyed for about 1,800 feet by the pressure of the rock revetment and the wind and waves from the outside, and a large additional quantity of the inside fill escaped. The question is which party must bear the last-mentioned loss. If the first break had not happened, no damage would have been done by the typhoon. The plaintiff sets forth the cost of repairing the damages of May 18, and seeks to recover it in this suit.<\/p><p>The specifications of the contract contain the following: <\/p><blockquote><p>\"5. The contractor will be responsible for damages to the bulkhead and revetment arising from wave action or from<\/p><\/blockquote><p>pressure of the revetment against the timber structure; but if a break is caused by pressure resulting from the mud fill, the repairs to the structure will be paid for by the Government at the prices specified in the contract; provided that the specifications have been fully complied with.<\/p><blockquote><p>\"12. * * * All losses of dredged material from the fills, excepting those due to failure of the bulkheads from pressure of the mud fill, as stated in article 5, will be measured as carefully as conditions will permit, and the computed amounts deducted from the statement for the final payment.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>On May 24, a supplemental contract was signed. It recited that the repairs made necessary by the break of May 1 ought to be paid for by the Government; that the original project was modified so as to fill the space that had given way with rock, with clay, etc., for the interstices; and that the change would either increase or diminish the cost. It then agreed that the plaintiff should make the repairs, and the Government would pay the actual and reasonable cost, with certain qualifications, plus 15 per centum, which last was to cover all other items, including profit. This referred to the first damage only. On the next day, May 25, the Government director telegraphed to Commissioner Forbes; \"for most of typhoon damage I hold contractor responsible; they claim Government responsible for all, on account delay repairing first break, but wish to make repairs in manner authorized for first break, leaving settlement of liability to be determined later. Repairs should be made at once, but in view of contract requirement * * * do not see how contractors can be authorized proceed before determination of liability.\" The answer approved \"authorizing contractors to proceed immediately to make repairs on lines indicated, with the understanding that all rights reserved in regard to adjudication of liabilities.\" These telegrams were communicated to the plaintiff, and it was authorized to proceed to make repairs in the manner outlined in the agreement of May 24. It did so, and the Government now refuses to pay.<\/p><p>It will be understood that this case is in no way concerned with the possible difference in cost between the mode of repair adopted and that which might have been followed under the original contract. The question here is which party is responsible for the repairs, assuming no such difference to exist. We need not consider whether the effect of all that we have recited was or was not to substitute the new mode and new cost for the old, as that which the parties left at risk when they agreed that the should have any claim for the excess alone, if any, over plaintiff should go on and do the work. If the plaintiff the cost that would have been incurred under the original plan, it is not suing for it here.<\/p><p>Both sides found their case on the division of losses made by the specification quoted. On the one hand, the accident would not have happened but for the pressure from the mud fill; on the other, the more immediate cause was wave action and the pressure of the revetment against the timber structure, the effects of which the contractor was to bear. We agree with the court below that the contractor must bear the loss. The question is not whether the responsibility of the Government might not have extended to the later consequences had it originally been a wrongdoer, and had it been sued in tort. The question is to what extent did the Government assume a risk which, but for the contract, would not have fallen upon it at all. The contract qualified the relation only cautiously and in part. If the break was caused by pressure from the mud fill, the Government agreed to pay for repairs to the structure. That was all.<\/p><p>But for the addition in 12, quoted above, it might be doubted whether \"structure\" meant anything but the bulkhead and revetment. But article 12 extends government liability to loss of dredged materials due to such a break. It is suggested that the reason for the Government undertaking was that the plan was made by the Government engineers. It may have been. But the plaintiff was content to work upon-that plan; it, not the Government, was doing the work, and it took the risk so far as the contract did not make a change. The Government could not be charged by it with negligence or with causing the first break. That was- only something for repairing which the Government had promised to pay. Whatever the Government had not promised to pay for, the contractor had to do, in order to offer the completed work which it had agreed to furnish. The case is stronger for the Government than those upon policies of insurance, where courts refuse to look behind the immediate cause to remoter negligence of the insured. (General Mut. Ins. Co. <em>vs.<\/em> Sherwood, 14 How., 352, 366; 14 L. ed., 452, 458; Orient Mut. Ins. Co. <em>vs.<\/em> Adams, 123 U. S., 67; 31 L. ed., 63; 8 Sup. Ct. Rep., 68; Dudgeon <em>vs.<\/em> Pembroke, L. R. 2 App. Cas., 284, 295; 14 Eng. Rul. Cas., 105.) Here, as we have said, the plaintiff cannot charge the defendant with negligence; the immediate event was one of which the plaintiff took the risk; on general principles of contract it took that risk unless it was agreed otherwise, and it does not matter to the result whether we say that we cannot look farther back than the immediate cause, or that the undertaking of the government did not extend to ulterior consequences, not specified, of the break for repairing which it undertook to pay, but which it did not cause. <\/p><p><em>Judgment affirmed<\/em>.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/><\/p><hr align=\"LEFT\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/>\u00a0 <sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup>219 U.

The defendant paid the first installment, but not the second; hence the complaint, which contains several demands: First, payment of the second installment, or P3,715, with interest thereon at 8 per cent from May 7, 1906; second, payment of P300 as attorneys' fees; third, payment of P200 \"for freight and transportation of the said machinery from San Isidro, Nueva Ecija, to Manila;\" fourth, payment of P20 a day \"as rent for each and every day the said machinery is detained and until the same be delivered to the plaintiff;\" fifth, the return of all the machinery and the payment of damages if the said machinery shall have been damaged; and sixth, payment of the costs.<br\/><br\/>The parties agreed in the contract that the same should be called one of lease; but the defendant testified at the trial that the contract was one of purchase and sale, and that it was called a lease in order that the machinery could not be disposed of until its sale price should have been entirely paid.<br\/><br\/>The Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, which tried this case, decided, in accordance with the testimony of the defendant, that the contract was one of sale. The plaintiff not having appealed from the judgment, this part thereof is now final, and it is established as a conclusion that the contract entered into by the parties was not one of lease.<br\/><br\/>The agreement not being one of lease, it is unnecessary to consider paragraphs 3, 4, and 5 of the complaint which are based on the supposition that it is a contract of lease. Moreover, the lower court having disregarded all these petitions, likewise that of paragraph 6 relative to the costs, or not having granted them in the judgment rendered, and the plaintiff company not having appealed, it is concluded that it does not insist upon them.<br\/><br\/>Only the two findings of the judgment of the lower court relating to the first two paragraphs of the complaint are the subject of this appeal, and whereby the defendant is adjudged to pay the second installment of the debt, that is, P3,715, with interest at 8 per cent per annum from the 7th of May, 1906, and P300 as attorneys' fees.<br\/><br\/>The defendant appealed from the judgment, with a right to a review of the evidence, and in his brief filed in this court adduced two classes of errors, one with regard to the form and the other with respect to the substance.<br\/><br\/>As to the form, for having overruled the exception or defense of <i>lis pendens <\/i>(second assignment of error), and also the counterclaim, the evidence offered relating to the facts of the counterclaim, and the remedy asked for in the cross complaint, to wit, the rescission of the contract (third and fifth assignments of error).<br\/><br\/>And as to the substance: for not having founa that the plaintiff also failed to, comply with the contract (first assignment of error), and for having adjudged the appellant to pay the costs, including the P300 for plaintiff's attorney's fees (fourth assignment of error).<br\/><br\/>With respect to the defense of <i>lis pendens,<\/i> these facts are alleged: First, that on May 10,1907, the defendant brought suit against the plaintiff in the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija, for the purpose of obtaining the rescission of this same contract, on the ground of plaintiff's noncompliance therewith; and second, that the plaintiff did not file the present suit against the defendant until October, 1907. By such allegations the defendant endeavored to weaken plaintiff's cause of action and prayed for a dismissal of the complaint; but the court held that neither the answer nor the evidence appeared to be sufficient to establish this defense and that, after all, it was not claimed that the suit was prosecuted to final judgment and, consequently, it could not serve as a basis for the defense of <i>res adjudicata.<\/i><br\/><br\/>In fact, the only proof adduced with respect to this alleged suit is that a copy of the complaint was served on the attorney for the defendant (now the plaintiff). We deem the reasons set forth by the lower court for disallowing such a defense to be in accord with the law; hence, the second assignment of error can not be sustained.<br\/><br\/>As to the third and fifth assignments, the appellant alleged, in the first instance, as the first cause of action in support of the counterclaim, that from the time of the execution of the contract to the date of his said counterclaim the mold-board plow could not be operated on the land; that it broke twice, and that, because of failure to operate, 20 hectares of rice land were left unsown and 50 were sown late. As a second cause of action, he further alleged that the plaintiff company did not deliver the thresher within the time stipulated, but some time thereafter, and that for this delay he was unable to thresh 3,000 <i>cavanes<\/i> of rice, wherefore he asked damages to the amount of 9,000 and some odd pesos, and in his cross complaint he asked for the rescission of the contract, with respect to the mold-board plow. He now alleges that the lower court erred in denying the counterclaim and not permitting the introduction of evidence relative to the facts alleged therein, and in denying the rescission. The appellant in his brief on the appeal recapitulates his contention in the matter and states that the appellee is not entitled to ask payment of the second installment since it failed to comply with the agreement to deliver the machinery to appellant's satisfaction, that is, after a trial, which should have been made immediately upon signing the contract, on May 7, 1906.<br\/><br\/>If the contract were a conditional one, dependent on a condition either precedent or subsequent; or if it had been agreed that there should be a previous test or trial of the thing sold, it would then be pertinent to examine the evidence adduced bearing on such trial or test, and the proofs introduced to show the compliance or noncompliance with the condition stipulated; but the agreement is simple, unconditional and absolute. This contract, in the form of a lease between the plaintiff and the defendant, contains ten clauses: The first concerns the term of the contract, to run until September 30, 1907; the second provides for the payment of the rental in two installments, as aforesaid - the sole clause applicable to the present litigation; the third relates to the execution of two promissory notes as causes of action for the recovery of the two stipulated installments of rental; the fourth concerns the title of ownership, which is to be retained by the lessor until the lessee shall have paid the two stipulated installments; the fifth binds the lessor to execute in favor of the lessee a proper bill of sale, provided the latter should pay the two said installments of rental and all other amounts contracted the sixth provides that the lessee shall not transfer the leased machinery, and creates responsibility for any injury, loss or damage it may suffer, including such as arise from unforeseen casualty; the seventh treats of the termination of the contract in the case where the lessee should fail to pay either of the installments aforesaid, and of the liability in the matter of costs and others; the eighth stipulates that the machinery shall be returned in good condition, in case of nonpayment; the ninth refers to a security of 2,000 <i>cavanes<\/i> of unhulled rice which the lessee must deposit in favor of the lessor; and the tenth clause relates to the expenses of freight and transportation, all of which are chargeable to the lessee. None of these clauses stipulates a previous test or trial, nor that the perfection and validity of the contract shall be subject to any act whatever on the part of the lessor. At the end of the instrument it is recorded that immediately after both contracting parties had signed the same they agreed that the three-gang disc plow should be substituted for a mold-board plow, both parties signing this addition to the contract (pp. 2 to 7 of the record).<br\/><br\/>It is therefore unnecessary to examine and pass upon the evidence introduced at the trial, for whatever it be, it can in nowise influence the validity of a simple contract, accepted and signed by both parties, of whom the one who might consider himself as not yet obligated signed, on the same contract date, the two promissory notes agreed upon, which in themselves alone constitute a right of action sufficient to require payment, without need of any other evidence, for the reason that the exhibition of the contract referred to constitutes proof of the basis of the debt which supports the promissory notes. So much with respect to the first basis of the cross complaint.<br\/><br\/>We hold that the disallowance of such a cause of action on the part of the defendant and of the evidence which he endeavored to introduce in connection therewith, was in accordance with the law.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the second ground of the cross complaint, that is, the delay in the delivery of the thresher, inasmuch as, according to the defendant's statement, it was not delivered on the day agreed upon, and 3,000 cavanes of unhulled rice were not threshed in consequence, first, we find in the contract no time whatever stipulated for such delivery, and then the following testimony: The defendant himself testified that he had about 4,000 cavanes of palay or unhulled rice and that he threshed all this rice when the thresher arrived. \"Many of my neighbors there who had rice and wanted to thresh it asked me to rent them the thresher as they wanted to do the work in a hurry in order to take advantage of the high price, but were unable to do so as the thresher was not there.\"<br\/><br\/>The witness H. L. Hunt, for the plaintiff, testified that the defendant paid the first installment of his debt, to wit, P3,715, P3,000 in Philippine currency on January 7, 1907, and $400.54 in United States currency on February 11th of the same year.<br\/><br\/>Another witness, John V. Pereyra, testified:<br\/><blockquote>\"The contract was executed, and after it was signed in the office of the attorney, Mr. Hixson, Mr. Sideco, Mr. Peveral, myself, and Mr. Webb went to our warehouse to see the engine, and during the conversation Mr. Sideco said he did not want the thresher shipped until the threshing season commenced, and he would advise the company in due course when he wanted it shipped.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Do you know what finally became of that threshing machine? - A. It was shipped to Mr. Sideco.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Now state what actually occurred between Mr. Sideco and Mr. Farmer at the time of the falling due of the first installment, that is to say, the promissory note for P3,715, which fell due on September 30, 1906. - A. It was long after the note was due that Mr. Sideco came to the office one morning with some money wrapped up in a handkerchief which he claimed contained P1,000. He offered to Mr. Farmer to pay that amount on account of his note, but stated that he wanted the threshing machine shipped and that he would make settlement of the balance of the note at some later date, to which Mr. Farmer replied that he could not do it and insisted on having full settlement of the amount due on the note.\"<\/blockquote>Witness, continuing, said that during the day Mr. Sideco returned with a contract drawn up by an attorney and offered to pay Mr. Farmer the amount of his note, provided the latter would sign that contract; that Mr. Farmer refused, on account of the conditions that it contained, which Mr. Farmer said were absurd. One of the conditions was that, if at the second trial of the plow the machinery was not satisfactory, it then would be the duty of the company to take back this machinery and return the money to Mr. Sideco. When asked on cross-examination whether before the first note became due Mr. Sideco had not been in the office with the amount thereof and offered to pay it provided they would assure him that the machinery would be satisfactory, he replied in the negative.<br\/><br\/>If on such testimony the lower court disallowed the second basis of the counterclaim, this court sees no reason to consider such a finding erroneous, supported as it is by a preponderance of evidence.<br\/><br\/>The dismissal of the cross complaint whereby the rescission of the contract is asked is also in accordance with the law. Contrary to appellant's contention, neither article 328 of the Code of Commerce nor article 1453 of the Civil Code has been violated, if\/ as found from the evidence adduced, it is not a question of goods which were not seen nor could be classified under a quality well known in commerce, in which case it is to be understood, according to the first of the said articles, that the purchaser reserves the privilege of examination and the right to rescind the contract if the goods do not suit him; nor of a sale made subject to approval or trial of the thing sold, nor of a sale of things which it is usual to test or try before being received, which sales, according to the second article cited, are always to be considered as made under a condition precedent.<br\/><br\/>For these very reasons, the first assignment of error should not be sustained, for the appellee company is not guilty of such noncompliance with the contract that the appellant may excuse himself for his arrears and failure to pay the second installment of the debt. As a special defense, the appellant stated in his answer to the complaint that the appellee had not complied with the stipulations of the contract, inasmuch as it had delayed in the delivery of the machinery and as, moreover, one of the machines, the mold-board plow, had been delivered broken and was then still in that condition.<br\/><br\/>The record shows, by the testimony of the appellee company itself and of its witness Benito Natividad, that the motor and the plow were in operation on the 18th or 19th of May, 1906, some ten days after the execution of the contract; and that with respect to the thresher, if it was not delivered at the same time as the motor and the plow, it was for the reasons aforesaid, according to the evidence.<br\/><br\/>The trial court found that there was no testimony whatever which tended to show that the plow was broken at the time of its delivery to the defendant; on the contrary, two witnesses testified that it was in good condition when it was shipped; and with regard to the alleged fact that it could not be used at the time it was tested, the lower court formed its opinion upon the facts that occurred, according to the evidence adduced. Against this opinion so formed, no violation of law or of doctrine is argued, nor are any grounds alleged whereby this court may set aside the preponderance of the evidence as found in the judgment rendered by the lower court.<br\/><br\/>It is claimed, from the foregoing allegations, that the machinery constantly showed defects and that it was unserviceable; but the law provides that the purchaser who has not made any claim based on the inherent defects in the article sold, within thirty days following its delivery, shall lose all rights of action against the vendor. (Art. 342, Code of Commerce.)<br\/><br\/>The first assignment of error has, therefore, not been proved; and with regard to the fourth, if the appellee defaulted in the payment of the debt, and it was stipulated in the seventh clause of the contract that, in case of the institution of judicial proceedings, the costs and attorney's fees shall be paid by the lessee or purchaser, the finding that the defendant must pay P300 as attorney's fees, an amount not impugned, as shown by the judgment, is in accordance with the law.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from provides that \"It is therefore found and adjudged that the plaintiff have and recover from the defendant the said sum of P3,715, with interest thereon at 8 per cent per annum from September 30, 1907, and attorney's fees in the sum of P300, with interest at 6 per cent per annum from October 1, 1907, together with the costs, and that, upon defendant so paying said amounts, the title to said machinery shall be decreed in him, but that he take nothing by his counterclaim and cross complaint.\"<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with the costs in this instance against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa,<\/i> and <i>Johnson, JJ.,<\/i> concur.<br\/><\/div>",

No other question is presented in the record which we can review.<\/p><p>The plaintiffs in error were tried, convicted, and sentenced on October 4, 1907, in the Court of First Instance, for violation of section 343 of the Philippine Penal Code, which makes it an offense to conduct a gambling house, or to be a banker therein. Plaintiffs in error were sentenced in the court of first instance to two months and one day of <em>arresto mayor<\/em>, with the accessories of section 61, and to pay a fine of 625 pesetas, and in default thereof to suffer subsidiary imprisonment, not to exceed one third of the principal penalty, and costs.<\/p><p>Upon appeal to the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands, that court held that the guilt of the appellants was fully established, and affirmed the judgment of the court of first instance. In the supreme court the plaintiffs in error made the objection, which is the foundation of the proceedings here, that they were convicted under the provisions of article 343 of the Philippine Code for an offense committed on the 15th of September, 1907; that thereafter the Philippine Commission, on October 9, 1907, by an Act Numbered 1757, repealed, among others, article 343 of the Philippine Penal Code, and that consequently the court had no authority to impose upon the appellants the penalty prescribed in the repealed article of the Code. The Supreme Court of the Islands denied this contention upon the authority of another decision in the same court. (United States <em>vs.<\/em> Cuna, 12 Philippine, 241.) A reference to the Cuna case shows that the Supreme Court of the Philippines, construing the articles of the local Penal Code, and applying what was deemed the applicable Spanish law, held that whether an act was punishable after the repeal of the act under which it was undertaken to be inflicted depend upon whether or not at the time of the commission of the Act, there was a law in force which penalized it. The court reserved the question whether the punishment provided in the repealing act could alone be inflicted if such penalty is more favorable to the accused than that prescribed in the former Act, because of the provisions of article 22 of the Code, which provides that penal laws shall have a retroactive effect in so far as they favor persons convicted of a crime or misdemeanor.<\/p><p>In appears that the new Act No. 1757, which took the place of the repealed act, article 343 of the Philippine Penal Code, did not undertake to wipe out the offense of gambling, or keeping a gambling house in the Philippine Islands, but substantially reenacted the former law with more elaboration and detail in its provisions than were contained in the former law.<\/p><p>In the new act section 2 defines a gambling house to be a building or structure or vessel, or part thereof, in which gambling is frequently carried on. Under article 343 of the Penal Code of the Philippine Islands, as it existed when the sentence in this case was imposed, the bankers and proprietors of houses where games of chance, stakes, or hazard are played were punished. The decision of the court of first instance, found in the record in this case, held that, in order to punish the crime of gambling, in accordance with article 343 of the Penal Code, it must appear that the house where the gambling took place was a house devoted to encouraging gambling, as held in various decisions of the Supreme Court of Spain applicable to the case at bar, and that such facts had been fully established by the proof in the case.<\/p><p>The sentence imposed was within the limits provided in Act No. 1757, under which the keeping of a gambling house can be punished. The case, therefore, presented for our consideration, is one of conviction under a statute which was repealed after the conviction and sentence in the court of first instance, the repealing act also providing for the punishment of the same offense, and within limitations not exceeding by the sentence imposed under the former act.<\/p><p>The precise question then is, Did the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands deny the plaintiffs in error due process of law in affirming a conviction under the circumstances stated? It is argued that the Supreme Court of the Philippines misapplied the provisions of the Penal Code and the Spanish law in the light of which it was interpreted. On the part of the Government it is insisted that, even at common law, the affirmation of a conviction under a law valid when it was had was not erroneous, and that it was within the power of a reviewing court so to do; but we are not concerned with this question. Our sole province is to determine whether the judgment of the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands amounts to a denial of due process of law.<\/p><p>This court has had frequent occasion to consider the requirements of due process of law as applied to criminal procedure, and generally speaking, it may be said that if an accused has been heard in a court of competent jurisdiction, and proceed against under the orderly processes of law, and only punished after inquiry and investigation, upon notice to him, with an opportunity to be heard, and a judgment awarded within the authority of a constitutional law, then he has had due process of law. (Rogers <em>vs.<\/em> Peck, 199 U. S., 435; 50 L. ed., 260; 26 Sup. Ct. Rep., 87; Twining <em>vs.<\/em> New Jersey, 211 U. S., 78; 53, L. ed., 97, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep., 14, and the cases therein cited.)<\/p><p>In the present case there can be no doubt that the law-making power in the Philippine Islands could, by statutory enactment, have preserved the right to prosecute and punish offenses committed in violation of the former law while in force in the islands, notwithstanding the repeal of the act. The effect of the decision of the Philippine Supreme Court is to hold that under the law and local statutes, the repealing act reenacting substantially the former law, and not increasing the punishment of the accused, the right still exists to punish the accused for an offense of which they were convicted and sentenced before the passage of the later act. In other words, the effect of the decision construing the local law is to accomplish what it was clearly within the power of the legislative authority to do by an express act saving the right to proceed as to offenses already committed. The accused have not been punished for a crime which was not punishable when committed by the sentence imposed. The Supreme Court has only held that the right to impose the penalty of the law under the Philippine Penal Code has not been taken away by the subsequent statute. We are unable to. see that due process of law, which is the right of a person accused of a crime, when prosecuted within a jurisdiction wherein the Constitution of the United States, or a statute embracing its provisions, is in force, has been denied.<\/p><p>The judgment of the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands will be affirmed.<\/p><p><em>Affirmed<\/em>.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 <br\/><\/p><hr align=\"LEFT\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/>\u00a0 <sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup><p><\/p> 218 U.S., 54 l. ed., 1049.<\/div>",

From that decision the defendants appealed.<br\/><br\/>To the complaint filed in the lower court the defendants demurred upon the grounds:<br\/><br\/>First. That the plaintiffs were without personality to commence the action;<br\/><br\/>Second. That there was a confusion of parties; and, Third, That the complaint was ambiguous, unintelligible, and vague.<br\/><br\/>The lower court overruled the demurrer, and the defendants answered.<br\/><br\/>In this court the appellants insist that the lower court should have sustained the demurrer upon the ground that the plaintiffs were minors and therefore could not bring an action in their own name without the intervention of a guardian. This defect of parties did not appear upon the face of the complaint and therefore the objection could not be made by demurrer. None of the grounds of demurrer enumerated in section 91 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions can be raised by a demurrer unless such defects appear upon the face of the complaint.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Section 92 of said code provides that \"When any of the matters enumerated in section 91 do not appear upon the face of the complaint, the objection can only be taken by answer.\"<br\/><br\/>The objection of minority not appearing upon the face of the complaint, it could not be raised by a demurrer. The lower court, therefore, properly sustained the demurrer. However, in the answer filed by the defendants in the lower court, after the demurrer was overruled, it was alleged that the plaintiffs were minors. This allegation, however, was neither denied nor proved during the trial of the case. It was proved, however, that the lands in question were inherited by the plaintiff, Gulib, from her father, Damasco. It also appears in evidence that the plaintiff, Gulib, had a minor sister called Idada (<i>alias<\/i> Idang), who was but 10 years of age at the time of the trial. If it be true that Damasco, at the time of his death, left other children besides Gulib, it will be presumed, until the contrary is shown, that the other children inherited with her. In an action, therefore, to recover possession of such inherited lands, the other coparceners must be made either plaintiffs or defendants, in order that their rights may be protected. The minor child should have been a party to the present action through her guardian. It appears also that the plaintiff, being a minor, was allowed to maintain the present action without the appointment of a guardian. This was also an error on the part of the lower court.<br\/><br\/>For the reason, therefore, that all of the necessary parties are not parties to the present action, the decision of the lower court is hereby reversed, without any finding as to costs, and the cause is remanded to the lower court in order that the pleadings may be amended and guardians appointed, so that all of the interested parties may be heard.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

S. currency as taxes on this lot on the basis that it contained 6,610 square meters. If it had been assessed at\u00a0 the same\u00a0 rate per square meter on the basis that it contained only 4,243.63 square meters, then\u00a0 he would have paid\u00a0 $3,555.17\u00a0 U.\u00a0 S. currency.\u00a0 He now seeks to recover $1,192.61 U.

He then proceeded to give the description and value of the same.<br\/><br\/>In the case at bar the appellee prepared his\u00a0 declaration for assessment, in which he set forth, under oath, that the parcel of land in question contained 6,610 square meters, and according to the form made out by him he placed a certain money value upon this property, giving a detailed description of the same, and it was upon this sworn declaration of the appellee that the taxes were assessed and collected for the six years.\u00a0 No objection was\u00a0 made\u00a0 to the payment of these taxes at any time during this period.\u00a0 It\u00a0 was not until after the city had surveyed this lot and\u00a0 found that it contained\u00a0 only 4,243.63 square\u00a0 meters that the appellee moved in the\u00a0 matter.\u00a0 On discovering the difference\u00a0 in the area of this lot he demanded\u00a0 of\u00a0 the city assessor and collector the refund of $1,192.61 U. S. currency.\u00a0 The matter was referred to the municipal board and denied.\u00a0 The appellee then instituted\u00a0 this action in the Court\u00a0 of First Instance.<br\/><br\/>The appellee admits that there is\u00a0 no express provision of the tax law providing for the correction\u00a0 of\u00a0 any\u00a0 errors whatsoever in the assessment roll, but insists that it is a well-established doctrine\u00a0 of quasi\u00a0 contract,\u00a0 to\u00a0 which the city\u00a0 of Manila\u00a0 is\u00a0 as\u00a0 thoroughly\u00a0 amenable\u00a0 as\u00a0 any\u00a0 other person, that money paid\u00a0 and received under a mutual mistake of fact must be returned.<br\/><br\/>\"Taxes are not contracts between party and party, either express or implied; but\u00a0 they\u00a0 are\u00a0 the positive\u00a0 acts of the Government,\u00a0 through its various agents, binding upon the inhabitants, and\u00a0 to the\u00a0 making and\u00a0 enforcing of\u00a0 which their\u00a0 personal\u00a0 consent,\u00a0 individually,\u00a0 is\u00a0 not\u00a0 required.\" (Cooley on Taxation, Vol. 1, page 19, citing: Johnson<i> vs.<\/i> Howard, 41 Vt., 122; Pierce <i>vs<\/i>.

STEVENSON &amp; CO., DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<br\/>\n<br\/>\nD E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>CARSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">Plaintiff seeks to recover damages alleged to have been sustained by reason of the failure of defendant to fulfill an alleged contract to deliver to plaintiff 2,000 tons of coal in the month of July, 1908, at a price stipulated.<br\/><br\/>Plaintiff alleges\u00a0 that on the 7th day of April, 1908, it entered into a verbal contract with one Armstrong, a broker, who was\u00a0 acting for and on behalf of defendant, whereby plaintiff agreed to\u00a0 buy of defendant and defendant to sell to plaintiff 2,000 tons of Duckenfield coal, to be delivered in the month of July, 1908, at the rate of P8.50 per ton; and that\u00a0 this contract was later reduced\u00a0 to writing in a memorandum executed in duplicate, one copy of which was signed by plaintiff and the other by defendant.<br\/><br\/>Defendant denies that it ever entered into any such contract, or that the broker Armstrong had authority to enter into any such contract for or on its behalf, and alleges that, on the contrary, the only authority it gave to Armstrong was to buy 2,000 tons of Duckenfield coal, at P8.50 per ton, to be delivered to\u00a0 it, the defendant, in the month of July; and\u00a0 defendant alleges further that the memorandum of the contract signed by defendant and introduced in evidence by the plaintiff is not a memorandum of a contract of sale by the defendant and purchase by plaintiff, but a memorandum of a proposed contract of puchase by defendant and sale by the\u00a0 plaintiff, wherein defendant signed as\u00a0 purchaser, and not as vender.<br\/><br\/>Plaintiff company is a retail coal dealer; defendant company is a wholesale merchant, whose business consists in part of the\u00a0 import of coal.\u00a0\u00a0 On\u00a0 April\u00a0 4, 1908, defendant received cable instructions from its London office to buy in the local market 2,000 tons\u00a0 of\u00a0 Duckenfield coal for\u00a0 July delivery provided it could be bought at about ^8.50 per ton. On the 6th of April, defendant's\u00a0 agent,\u00a0 a Mr.\u00a0 Corbet, who was\u00a0 in charge of its coal department, informed Mr. Armstrong, of the brokerage firm of Armstrong &amp; Mackay, that his company was in the market for 2,000 tons of Duckenfield coal, provided it\u00a0 could be\u00a0 bought for July\u00a0 delivery at a price not exceeding P8.50 per ton.\u00a0 Armstrong understood Corbet to say that the defendant company was in the market to sell\u00a0 upon the terms indicated, and on\u00a0 the afternoon of the same day he called at the office of the defendant company and submitted a paper in words and figures, as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Coal contract between Messrs. Madrigal &amp; Co.,\u00a0 buyers, and Messrs. W. F. Stevenson &amp; Co., sellers.<br\/>\"Date of sale, Manila, 7th April, 1908.<br\/>\"Quantity, 2,000 (two thousand) tons of 2,240 lbs.<br\/>\"Description, Duckenfield.<br\/>\"Delivery in July this year.<br\/>\"Shipment, P8.50 per ton,\u00a0 eight pesos\u00a0 &amp; fifty cents, of 2,240 lbs.<br\/>\"Weight to be taken.<br\/>\"Duty for account of sellers.<br\/>\"Payable on delivery.<br\/><br\/>\"The act of God, enemies, restraints, rulers, or princes, fire and all and every other dangers and accidents of the seas, rivers, and navigation during the voyage, and riots, commotions by\u00a0 keelmen, strikes or lockouts of pitmen, or other hands, frost, floods, or any other accidents or causes beyond the control of the\u00a0 sellers\u00a0 which\u00a0 may\u00a0 prevent or<br\/>hinder the loading or unloading the cargo always excepted.<br\/>\" (Signed)\u00a0 Brokers Armstrong &amp; Mackay.<br\/>\"Accepted,................buyers.<br\/>\"Accepted,................sellers.\"<\/blockquote>Mr. Stevenson,\u00a0 the manager of the defendant company, believing this document to be a memorandum of the terms of a proposed contract between his company and the plaintiff company, whereby plaintiff was to sell and defendant to buy coal in accordance with its stipulations, signed the name of the defendant company in the blank space opposite the word \"buyer,\" in\u00a0 token of his acceptance.\u00a0 This memorandum was immediately delivered to Armstrong,\u00a0 who in turn delivered it to Madrigal &amp; Co.\u00a0 Two\u00a0 days afterwards, on April 9, Armstrong forwarded to the defendant company a duplicate of the above set out memorandum, with the name of the plaintiff company signed in the blank space opposite the word \"buyer,\" just as the name of the defendant\u00a0 company was\u00a0 signed\u00a0 in\u00a0 the duplicate\u00a0 memorandum delivered by it to the broker.\u00a0\u00a0 Corbet, defendant company's agent,\u00a0 immediately returned this\u00a0 memorandum\u00a0 to\u00a0 the broker, calling his\u00a0 attention to the fact that plaintiff had attached its name in the blank space for the buyer instead of the seller, and requesting the broker to have the memorandum corrected, and the name of the\u00a0 plaintiff attached thereto as seller instead of buyer.\u00a0 On the same day Armstrong communicated with the plaintiff company, and informed it of defendant\u00a0 company's claim that it was\u00a0 the buyer and not the seller, and that it\u00a0 had\u00a0 signed the memorandum upon that\u00a0 understanding.\u00a0 A few days\u00a0 later, on the 13th of April, plaintiff company addressed a communication to the defendant company, calling\u00a0 defendant's attention to\u00a0 the fact that the\u00a0 latter's name was attached to the memorandum signed by it in the blank space reserved for the buyer, and asking defendant company to correct\u00a0 the alleged error.\u00a0 In\u00a0 reply, defendant\u00a0 company, which had already stated its position to the broker, referred the plaintiff\u00a0 to\u00a0 the\u00a0 broker\u00a0 for\u00a0 explanation\u00a0 of\u00a0 its\u00a0 position.\u00a0 No further action appears to have been\u00a0 taken by either party until the month of July, when plaintiff formally demanded of defendant the fulfillment of its alleged contract for the sale of coal on the terms sit out\u00a0 in the memorandum.\u00a0 Defendant, denying that it ever entered\u00a0 into a contract for the sale of coal on the terms set out in the\u00a0 memorandum, refused to make delivery, and this action was\u00a0 instituted for\u00a0 the recovery of alleged damages resulting therefrom.<br\/><br\/>All of the above\u00a0 set-out facts\u00a0 are practically admitted, except that plaintiff denies or rather\u00a0 questions the findings of the trial court that Corbet, the defendant's agent, when he originally treated with the\u00a0 broker, proposed a\u00a0 purchase and\u00a0 not a\u00a0 sale of\u00a0 coal;\u00a0 and that when\u00a0 the\u00a0 signature of Stevenson &amp;\u00a0 Co. was attached to the memorandum of the transaction, it was attached in good faith as buyer and not as seller.<br\/><br\/>In support of its contentions in this regard, plaintiff relies on the deposition of the broker who states that he understood\u00a0 Corbet to propose a sale; and upon\u00a0 the language of the title of the memorandum, which expressly states that it is a memorandum of a contract between\u00a0 Madrigal &amp; Co., buyer, and Stevenson\u00a0 &amp; Co., seller.\u00a0 But Corbet positively asserts that he told the broker that his firm\u00a0 was\u00a0 in the market as a buyer,\u00a0 and the broker admitted that he may have been, or\u00a0 rather\u00a0 must have been,\u00a0 mistaken;\u00a0 and the signature of defendant company on the memorandum, as buyer, rebuts the inference sought to\u00a0 be drawn from the title, which defendant's manager states he\u00a0 did not observe at\u00a0 the time when\u00a0 he attached the company's\u00a0 signature. Certainly in the absence of other evidence the signature of defendant\u00a0 company as buyer upon the memorandum is not sufficient in itself to sustain a finding that\u00a0 it was attached there as seller.<br\/><br\/>The truth appears to be,\u00a0 as stated above,\u00a0 that both plaintiff and defendant throughout the transaction were dealing in\u00a0 good faith\u00a0 and\u00a0 that the confusion\u00a0 arose through the mistake of the broker.\u00a0 The <i>bona fides<\/i> of the plaintiff company is not questioned, and that of the defendant company is made clear by the evidence of the circumstances under\u00a0 which it entered on\u00a0 the transaction,\u00a0 and\u00a0 its\u00a0 conduct immediately thereafter.\u00a0 The proven copy of the cable from its London office, dated April 40,leaves no\u00a0 room for doubt that it was in\u00a0 the market\u00a0 as a buyer,\u00a0 and its cable to its London office immediately after the signing of the broker's memorandum announcing its fulfillment of the instructions received in the\u00a0 former\u00a0 cable clearly\u00a0 disclose its understanding of\u00a0 the\u00a0 transaction;\u00a0 and all doubt of\u00a0 its\u00a0 good faith throughout would seem to be dispelled by its prompt action in calling\u00a0 attention\u00a0 to what it believed to be\u00a0 plaintiff's mistake in\u00a0 signing the\u00a0 broker's memorandum as purchaser, and\u00a0 the return of\u00a0 the memorandum\u00a0 to\u00a0 the\u00a0 broker immediately\u00a0 after receiving it and observing that plaintiff's signature was attached thereto as buyer.\u00a0 This, especially, in view of the fact that these transactions took place early in the month of April, and the proposed delivery of coal was not to be made until the following July.<br\/><br\/>We are satisfied that the weight of the evidence discloses that neither the defendant company nor any of its agents authorized the broker Armstrong\u00a0 to make the alleged sale on its behalf, and that no verbal contract for the sale of coal was entered into by the defendant company with the plaintiff company as alleged by the latter; and that the broker's memorandum signed by the defendant company neither in intent nor by its express terms constituted a\u00a0 promise\u00a0 or agreement by the defendant company to sell and deliver coal.<br\/><br\/>As the trial court well says, \"the minds of the parties never met upon a contract of sale by defendant to plaintiff,\" or,\u00a0 in other words, there was no mutual consent by the parties to the alleged contract, and, therefore, there was\u00a0 no contract, and the\u00a0 trial court properly\u00a0 declined\u00a0 to allow damages for an alleged\u00a0 breach.\u00a0\u00a0 (Art.\u00a0 1261, Civil Code; see also cases cited on this subject,\u00a0 9 Cyc., 245.)\u00a0\u00a0 The judgment of the trial court should be, and is therefore, affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano,\u00a0 C.\u00a0 J.,\u00a0 Torres,\u00a0 Johnson,<\/i> and <i>Moreland, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><\/div>",

These two men sought were Primo Avedillo and Cirilo Enriquez and they had been in the said house a few moments before.\u00a0\u00a0 The landlord's\u00a0 daughters,\u00a0 Elena and Valentina Marquez, told the searchers that Avedillo and Enriquez had already gone, so the said Cruz and Soriano left, accompanied by Alejo Root, who had not entered but remained on the lot, in search of the said <i>mestizos.<\/i>\u00a0 When the appellants and the said Root arrived at the<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> sitio<\/span> of Talon-Talon of the district of Zamboanga, they found, between 11 and 12 o'clock that night, several\u00a0 individuals who were giving a serenade in front of the house of Eugenio Iturralde,\u00a0 and one of the soldiers then inquired of his countrymen, there assembled, which of them\u00a0 had insulted the first sergeant of the company of Scouts, and he was told that none of those present had done so; thereupon, while Pedro de la Cruz stepped back a few steps, the soldier Ale jo Root\u00a0 came face to face with the mestizo Primo Avedillo, who was then leaning with his arms against the fence of the lot on which the house stood, and immediately gave him a heavy blow on the mouth with his fist.\u00a0\u00a0 On account of this assault\u00a0 Avedillo started to run and Cirilo Enriquez\u00a0 followed him, dispersing at\u00a0 the same time the other\u00a0 parties who were assembled\u00a0 there for the serenade; the latter, on account of the suddenness of the assault, were unable to observe how it occurred nor what else happened, for three of them, Juan Candido, Tomas Francisco, and Pablo Candido, present during\u00a0 the disorder, on seeing the blow given to Avedillo, started to run, and Cirilo Enriquez alone stated that, on\u00a0 running behind\u00a0 the\u00a0 deceased, he\u00a0 saw\u00a0 the three Scout\u00a0 soldiers, one\u00a0 of\u00a0 them\u00a0 Sergeant Cruz, catch Avedillo,\u00a0 and that, while two of them held him fast and struck him, the other stabbed\u00a0 him to death with a\u00a0 weapon with\u00a0 which\u00a0 he\u00a0 was\u00a0 provided.\u00a0 In\u00a0 fact, according to the examination and autopsy made on the following day by Dr. J. B. Clayton, of the\u00a0 military medical\u00a0 corps, the body of the deceased bore three wounds, one near the eighth rib, which slightly injured the stomach and severed a few\u00a0 veins, including a\u00a0 large one\u00a0 which\u00a0 could not\u00a0 be exactly determined on account of\u00a0 the coagulation\u00a0 of blood; another,\u00a0 three inches and\u00a0 a half deep, near the fifth rib, which pierced the pericardium and the left ventricle of the heart and must have caused instant\u00a0 death; and the third wound, a bruise, on the upper lip, produced by a blow with a clenched fist.\u00a0\u00a0 The two wounds first described were\u00a0 inflicted with a dagger or like weapon<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, after the preliminary examination by the justice of the peace court, the assistant fiscal of the Moro Province, on the 28th of September of the same year, filed an information with the Court of First Instance of Zamboanga, charging Pedro\u00a0 de la Cruz, Felix Soriano, and\u00a0 Alejo Root with the crime of murder, and, this cause having been instituted, the court, upon the evidence adduced at trial, rendered judgment on November 12 following, convicting the accused of the crime of homicide and sentenced them to the penalty of seventeen years and four months of <i>reclusion temporal,<\/i> to pay jointly and severally an indemnity of P1,000 to the heirs of the deceased, to the corresponding accessory penalties, and to the payment of the costs.\u00a0 From this\u00a0 judgment Pedro de la Cruz and Felix Soriano alone appealed.<br\/><br\/>The facts above related, which were duly proved in\u00a0 the present cause, constitute the crime of murder, provided\u00a0 for and\u00a0 punished by article 403 of the Penal\u00a0 Code,\u00a0 inasmuch as the deceased,\u00a0 Primo\u00a0 Avedillo,\u00a0 died a violent death in consequence of two serious wounds, one of them necessarily fatal, at the hands of one of his three assailants,\u00a0 while he was stretched out\u00a0 on the ground and\u00a0 was being maltreated and held fast by the other two, who prevented him from moving, which situation was taken advantage of by the\u00a0 third assailant, who with\u00a0 a\u00a0 dagger or\u00a0 like\u00a0 pointed weapon assaulted the victim and inflected upon him the said wounds,\u00a0 one in the stomach and the other in the breast. The\u00a0 second\u00a0 wound\u00a0 penetrated the pericardium and\u00a0 a ventricle of\u00a0 the heart.\u00a0 At the time of\u00a0 the assault the said Avedillo\u00a0 was unsuccessful in defending himself, or even so much as freeing himself and escaping from\u00a0 his three assailants, for he had been running from the moment he received the blow in the mouth delivered by his slayer, and when the other two overtook him they held him fast and stretched\u00a0 him out on\u00a0 the ground and did not leave him until he died from the wounds; wherefore, it is undeniable that, in the killing of the unfortunate victim Avedillo, there entered the specific and qualifying circumstance of treachery, which determines the\u00a0 crime of\u00a0 murder, because the assailants employed\u00a0 ways and means conducive directly to assure the consummation of the common purpose of depriving the deceased\u00a0 of\u00a0 his life, without any risk whatever to themselves, such\u00a0 as could have\u00a0 arisen from any\u00a0 defense which\u00a0 the assaulted\u00a0 party might have made, but who was then completely helpless\u00a0 and, since the beginning when he was struck by the accused who afterwards stabbed him with a dagger, had not shown the\u00a0 slightest intention nor made any action whatever to resist or to defend himself from the unjust and uncalled for assault.<br\/><br\/>The defendants,\u00a0 Pedro de\u00a0 la\u00a0 Cruz and\u00a0 Felix Soriano, pleaded \"not guilty\" and denied the charge; but notwithstanding\u00a0 their exculpatory allegations,\u00a0 absolutely\u00a0 devoid of proof,\u00a0 it\u00a0 was shown\u00a0 that the said Cruz and Soriano tenaciously pursued\u00a0 the deceased, Primo Avedillo, and, as soon as they overtook him, held him fast, illtreated\u00a0 him and threw him to the ground, at which moment, and while still\u00a0 held\u00a0 by\u00a0 them, the other\u00a0 soldier,\u00a0 Alejo Root,\u00a0 arrived and\u00a0 with\u00a0 the dagger which he carried,\u00a0 leaped upon the deceased and wounded him in the breast and in the stomach; all of which\u00a0 was witnessed by\u00a0 Cirilo Enriquez,\u00a0 who\u00a0 was also\u00a0 running behind the deceased, Avedillo,\u00a0 and although the other witnesses, Juan\u00a0 Candido,\u00a0 Pablo Candido,\u00a0 and Tomas\u00a0 Francisco, did not\u00a0 see the assault,\u00a0 because they ran away in\u00a0 view of the fact that the\u00a0 sergeant and the two soldiers who went with him were maltreating everybody, yet they saw the appellants pursue Avedillo, who was afterwards killed.\u00a0\u00a0 Besides these facts, it is established that the said appellants, Cruz and Soriano, were\u00a0 those who, with Alejo Root, appeared at the place where the deceased and others were playing musical instruments, illtreated them and then pursued them, only overtaking Primo Avedillo, and that on this occasion they were\u00a0 looking for a mestizo with a mustache who, they said, had\u00a0 insulted the\u00a0 first sergeant, their purpose\u00a0 being undoubtedly to punish the\u00a0 former or avenge the latter.<br\/><br\/>Although\u00a0 Alejo Root\u00a0 did\u00a0 not\u00a0 appeal from\u00a0 the judgment rendered in\u00a0 this cause, in view of the fact that, in incriminating his\u00a0 codefendants, Cruz and Soriano,\u00a0 he\u00a0 at the same time confessed to his having attacked the deceased and wounded him\u00a0 with a dagger, such statements undoubtedly tend to prove that his said two codef endants actually pursued the deceased,\u00a0 Avedillo, and\u00a0 afterwards\u00a0 overtook him,\u00a0 and that while they held him fast, stretched out on the ground as he was, Root leaped upon the assaulted man and wounded him\u00a0 with a dagger; from\u00a0 all\u00a0 of\u00a0 which\u00a0 testimony\u00a0 it is concluded that the three\u00a0 defendants acted\u00a0 together in common accord\u00a0 wilih unity\u00a0 of purpose\u00a0 and action in order to attack the deceased.<br\/><br\/>It is true\u00a0 that it was Alejo Root\u00a0 alone who inflicted the two wounds upon the deceased, but\u00a0 had\u00a0 the latter not been held fast on the ground by the defendants, Pedro de la Cruz and Felix Soriano, who were the first to overtake and hold him, perhaps Alejo\u00a0 Root would not have succeeded in getting at him, nor in assaulting him, as described, inasmuch as he was following his codefendants.<br\/><br\/>It is to be noted that, as antecedents of\u00a0 the criminal act, the three defendants went together in their\u00a0 quest for the party who they claimed\u00a0 had insulted the\u00a0 first sergeant of their\u00a0 company, and thus they went to\u00a0 the house of Juan Marquez and, as they did not find the said party there, they continued their search with intentions which doubtless were neither peaceable nor lawful, and then together approached several\u00a0 persons who\u00a0 were\u00a0 playing musical instruments, whom, without any cause whatever, they illtreated, on which occasion\u00a0 Root\u00a0 struck the deceased, Avedillo, a blow on the mouth, and the latter, as well as the others, the musicians, on running away without defending themselves,\u00a0 were pursued\u00a0 by the appellants determinedly until they overtook Avedillo and held him fast and laid him\u00a0 out on the ground; in this situation Alejo Root, who came immediately behind his two coaccused,\u00a0 took part in\u00a0 the assault.\u00a0 The two\u00a0 appellants, therefore,\u00a0 are unquestionably coperpetrators of the murder, as they took a direct part in the commission of the crime which was consummated by their\u00a0 participation, inasmuch as, had they not\u00a0 caught, held, and\u00a0 stretched out on the ground the deceased, Primo Avedillo, perhaps the latter might have\u00a0 been able to escape out\u00a0 of the\u00a0 reach of\u00a0 the said Root, who apparently was the only one of the aggressors who was armed.<br\/><br\/>No extenuating nor aggravating\u00a0 circumstance attended the perpetration\u00a0 of the crime, wherefore\u00a0 the penalty\u00a0 for murder should be imposed upon them it\u00a0 its medium degree.<br\/><br\/>Wherefore, it is\u00a0 our opinion that, with\u00a0 a reversal of\u00a0 the judgment appealed from, Pedro\u00a0 de\u00a0 la Cruz and Felix\u00a0 Soriano, as coauthors\u00a0 of the crime\u00a0 of murder,\u00a0 should be sentenced, each of them, to the penalty of <i>cadena perpetua,<\/i> to the accessory penalties 2\u00a0 and\u00a0 3 prescribed by article 54 of the Penal Code, to pay an indemnity of P1,000, jointly and severally with\u00a0 Alejo Root, to the heirs of the deceased, and, each of them, a third part of the costs of first\u00a0 instance and one-half of those of this second instance.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

The prosecution claims that the crime thus\u00a0 committed by the Igorots was suggested,\u00a0 incited, and brought\u00a0 about by the defendant, Rufino Ancheta, who sought the death of his uncle Tiburcio in order to satisfy certain feelings of resentment, and\u00a0 also in order that he might inherit\u00a0 Tiburcio's property.\u00a0\u00a0 The case rests upon the\u00a0 evidence of the Igorots Laoyan and Guay,\u00a0 and certain circumstances corroborative thereof.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 defense contends that the defendant can not be convicted of the crime of robbery with homicide, because of the absence of the intent of gain to himself, one of the essential elements of the crime of robbery.\u00a0 We can not give weight or force to this contention, because\u00a0 whether or not the accused intended to gain or did gain financially or otherwise by the\u00a0 robbery is wholly immaterial.\u00a0 The mere fact of inducing the commission\u00a0 of the crime makes him a principal. (Supreme court of Spain, judgment of October 20, 1881.) The crime was consummated and completed when the persons induced committed the crime <i>with the intent to gain for themselves. <\/i> The instant the crime became complete <i>as to them,<\/i> that instant the accused became a principal.\u00a0 No further participation in the crime was necessary.\u00a0 This is apparent from the provisions of article 13\u00a0 of the\u00a0 Penal Code as well as from reason and authority.<br\/><br\/>The four\u00a0 Igorots named\u00a0 in the complaint left their rancheria, called Booyan,.and went to a rancheria called Lesseb, where they passed the night.\u00a0 Leaving there in the morning, by evening of the day they arrived at a point near Cervantes, where the defendant lived with his wife\u00a0 Petra.\u00a0 They were not acquainted with\u00a0 the defendant, but went to his house and told him they wanted work, and were asked if they would like to kill a man, a relative who had mistreated him, and whom he would like to have out of the way.\u00a0 As an inducement or reward for killing the man, the defendant told the Igorots that the man to be killed had recently sold some land, and received P40 therefor, and this sum they would find in the house; that they could also take his carabao and\u00a0 exchange\u00a0 it for a\u00a0 younger one, which\u00a0 he would later purchase from them.\u00a0 As\u00a0 the witness Guay testified, the defendant said to them: \"If you go to work, you only make a little; it is better to kill this man and take his carabao and the P40 which was received from the sale of the house in town.\"\u00a0 The Igorots agreed to kill the man.\u00a0\u00a0 The defendant was to go to a\u00a0 place called Ululing in the morning, and remain\u00a0 away\u00a0 until after the crime had been committed. The Igorots\u00a0 were to hide in the bushes south of the victim's house until night, when they should\u00a0 go to his house and kill him.<br\/><br\/>The defendant left for Ululing, and the Igorots spent the day in the bushes, where the defendant's wife brought them food.\u00a0 At night they went\u00a0 to the defendant's house to eat. From there they proceeded\u00a0 to Tiburcio's hut, some 70 yards distant, for\u00a0 the purpose of carrying out their design, but finding him armed with a long bolo, they decided not to take the\u00a0 risk involved in\u00a0 attacking\u00a0 him,\u00a0 and returned to the bushes, where they spent the night.<br\/><br\/>The next morning they went to the house of one Bacolog, near Ululing, where they found the defendant taking his breakfast with Bacolog and an Ilocano named Abot.\u00a0 When the\u00a0 Igorots saw the defendant alone, they explained\u00a0 why they had not killed Tiburcio, and the defendant replied: \"Why did you eat my chickens if you are not going to do what I told you to do?\u00a0 I came here to spend the night in Cambaguio because I\u00a0 thought you were going to kill him.\"<br\/><br\/>The Igorots then spent three days clearing some land for Bacolog,\u00a0 for which they received\u00a0 P2.25.\u00a0 About noon of the third day of their work\u00a0 the defendant went to\u00a0 them and said: \"Now you must repeat what I told you to do,\u00a0 and comply with our agreement.\u00a0 I am going to Ululing today, and\u00a0 I wish you to kill Tiburcio tonight.\u00a0 You\u00a0 go to the bushes and conceal yourselves in the same place where you were concealed before.\"\u00a0\u00a0 The four Igorots then left\u00a0 the house of Bacolog and returned\u00a0 to the defendant's\u00a0 house, where they saw his wife Petra, who told them to go to Tiburcio's\u00a0 house and pretend they\u00a0 wanted to cook\u00a0 their\u00a0 rice there. They again concealed themselves in the\u00a0 bushes, where as before\u00a0 Petra brought\u00a0 them their\u00a0 food.\u00a0 After darkness came they went\u00a0 to the house of Tiburcio,\u00a0 and having established familiar relations with him by means of appealing to\u00a0 his\u00a0 hospitality they killed him.\u00a0 They were unable to find the P40, but took the carabao, and\u00a0 carried it away with them.<br\/><br\/>The testimony of the Igorot witnesses gives a vivid idea of the manner in which this crime was committed, and the way\u00a0 in which the savages were induced to act.\u00a0 The witness Laoyan testified as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"We started from Lesseb in the morning and we arrived at his house in the evening, and we went there for the purpose\u00a0 of asking him whether or not he had some\u00a0 work for us.\u00a0\u00a0 When\u00a0 we stopped at his house on that night Rufino Ancheta said to us that he wanted us to go and kill a man because that man had\u00a0 sold a house of theirs for the sum of P40 and that he had not given Rufino any part of it, and besides that we made rice fields and he did not give me but a very small part of it, and he said that I hate him for that reason.\u00a0 Besides all of that, Rufino Ancheta said that Tiburcio was the son of one hundred fathers;\u00a0 and then he gave us five chickens to kill and we looked at the galls of the chickens and\u00a0 we found out from the galls that it was all right; that it\u00a0 was a good time to kill a man. And then Pinong Ancheta\u00a0 asked us whether we could kill that man that night or not, and we told him yes, we can kill him if you wish it done.\u00a0 And then afterwards he said to me: 'I am living here alone with my\u00a0 wife and the best thing for us to do is that I am going to Ululing tomorrow morning (<i>or<\/i> Cambaguio), and then you will also go to the bushes to the south of the\u00a0 house and tomorrow night you will go to kill this man. I want to\u00a0 go to Cambaguio so that I can avoid being examined\u00a0 after that man has been killed.'\u00a0 In the daytime,\u00a0 according to the instructions of Pinong, we went to conceal\u00a0 ourselves in the bushes around the house of Pinong, and at night we went to the house of Tiburcio for the purpose of killing him, but as we found him with a long bolo in his possession we were afraid to do it, and then we went back to\u00a0 the bushes.\u00a0 The next day in the morning very early we went to meet Pinong in the house of Bacolog, and when we arrived there Pinong asked us 'Why did you not kill him?' and we\u00a0 replied, 'No, because we were afraid because he\u00a0 had a long bolo.'\u00a0 Then Pinong said, 'Why did you eat my chickens if you are not going to do what I told you to do?\u00a0\u00a0 I came here to spend the night in Cambaguio because I thought you were going to kill him.' And then I spoke to Bacolog about cleaning four parcels of\u00a0 land of his, and we agreed to clean the four parcels of land for the sum of P2.25.\u00a0 And Pinong and Abot, who was with him there,\u00a0 went to plow some lands there while we\u00a0 were cleaning off the four parcels.\u00a0 Then on the day that we had been working there we spent the night also in the place of Bacolog, and\u00a0 the\u00a0 second\u00a0 day in the morning very early Pinong and\u00a0 his companion continued to plow\u00a0 the lands where they were working on.\u00a0 In the afternoon they left that place and we remained there.\u00a0 When Pinong asked me why we did not kill that man Tiburcio, Bacolog was plowing some land and his companions\u00a0 were some distance away from us.\u00a0 I do not know where he\u00a0 had gone to, and\u00a0 no one heard this conversation.\u00a0\u00a0 And when we finished our work Pinong came back to Bacolog's house or place in\u00a0 the morning very early and he said to us: 'Now you\u00a0 must\u00a0 repeat what I told you to do\u00a0 and comply\u00a0 with our agreement.\u00a0 I am going to Ululing today, and I wish you to kill Tiburcio tonight.\u00a0 You go to the bushes and conceal yourselves\u00a0 in the same place\u00a0 that you\u00a0 concealed yourselves in before.' When we left Bacolog's place the sun was about\u00a0 12\u00a0 o'clock and\u00a0 we went\u00a0 to conceal ourselves\u00a0 in the place where\u00a0 we were concealed before.\u00a0\u00a0 We arrived at the house of Pinong in the afternoon and we did not meet anyone there\u00a0 except his wife Petra.\u00a0 We went to the house of Tiburcio and\u00a0 we found them there cooking their supper; and while they were eating their supper we cooked our rice.\u00a0 After our rice was cooked we also ate our supper.\u00a0 And then all of us went outside of the house, in\u00a0 front of the house on the porch.\u00a0 As Tiburcio sat down in the doorway of\u00a0 the door I and\u00a0 Dalocdoc sat down in front\u00a0 of him and Udcusan sat to his left, and Guay to his right; and while in this position they\u00a0 struck him.\u00a0 Guay struck Tiburcio with a club about as long as this, a piece of wood, and about as\u00a0 large as my arm\u00a0 [indicating a club a little less than a meter long], and Udcusan struck him on his legs\u00a0 with a piece of wood or club.\u00a0 And after this we\u00a0 went inside of the house to search for the P40, which was the price of the house according to Pinong, and as we could not find it we asked his wife Salome\u00a0 where that money was, and she told us it was used to pay for some clothing and bolos.\u00a0 And then we took the carabao off with us because Pinong, Rufino Ancheta, promised that we should have that carabao as our reward as well as the P40.\u00a0 And Pinong further told us that if we got that carabao we should exchange it for a younger carabao which has horns about like this [indicating a young carabao's horns about 8 inches long]\u00a0 and then I will come and buy that carabao from you to use in my\u00a0 Work.\u00a0 We only had the intention to rob the carabao and\u00a0 without induction\u00a0 we would\u00a0 not\u00a0 have\u00a0 killed that man but\u00a0 we killed him because that man instructed us to kill him\u00a0 [indicating the accused, Rufino Ancheta].\u00a0\u00a0 And Pinong instructed us not to take the young pigs and chickens, because\u00a0 he\u00a0 said\u00a0 they would be used in feeding the people who would bury the body of Tiburcio.\u00a0 I tell the truth\u00a0 now, and we left in the house some palay, a jar full of rice, some other things, a barate, and an ax, and we also left there a brass jar which they used for cooking camotes for the pigs.\u00a0\u00a0 And he\u00a0 [indicating Rufino Ancheta, the accused] also told us not to take the black shirt because that he said would be placed on the dead\u00a0 body when it was buried.\u00a0 When we asked Salome about this black shirt she said it was here in town in the possession of his mother. And the woman\u00a0 Salome took with her the\u00a0 three bolos and placed them in her belt; and myself and Salome opened the trunk out of which we took the clothing and skirt, and we took the clothing out and placed them in a basket and she took them with her.\"<\/blockquote>The witness Guay said:<br\/><blockquote>\"We came\u00a0 from our <i>rancheria<\/i> and\u00a0 went to the\u00a0 house of Pinong (the\u00a0 defendant Ancheta). We came\u00a0 from Boogan and we\u00a0 slept in Lesseb,\u00a0 and\u00a0 we\u00a0 came with Udcusan.\u00a0 We came from Lesseb and we\u00a0 arrived in Ululing to look for some\u00a0 work.\u00a0 We were four\u00a0 with Udcusan, and we came to the house of Pinong.\u00a0\u00a0 When\u00a0 we arrived at the house\u00a0 of\u00a0 Pinong it\u00a0 was\u00a0 nighttime.\u00a0 We arrived that night in\u00a0 the house of Pinong, and\u00a0 he\u00a0 asked us where we were going, and we told him to look for some\u00a0 work, and he then\u00a0 asked us if we wanted\u00a0 to kill a man and we replied\u00a0 to him, 'Why are we going to kill\u00a0 a man? and then he said,\u00a0 'I am his only relative and there will be no one to complain against you afterwards, and I am mad\u00a0 at him because of the action of this man in\u00a0 regard to the sale of\u00a0 our\u00a0 house in the town.'\u00a0\u00a0 Pinong said that he was mad because he\u00a0 sold their house\u00a0 in the town and did not give him anything, and also their rice fields and that\u00a0 he did not give\u00a0 him a part of them.\u00a0 And\u00a0 also he said that when he asked him for the carabao to work some he did not wish to let him\u00a0 take it.\u00a0 He said in the early morning 'you go away and I am going to look for some labor and at night you go and\u00a0 kill him,\u00a0 because if I am near\u00a0 there they will call me to examine me.'\u00a0 We went near\u00a0 the house of Pinong in a gully near by to hide there, and our food\u00a0 was\u00a0 brought to us by Petra, the wife of Pinong.\u00a0 All that we ate for dinner\u00a0 was cooked by Petra, and Daloedoc went to look for her. At night we went to eat in the house of Pinong, and on that night we went to\u00a0 the house of Tiburcio.\u00a0 We found him armed\u00a0 with a bolo and\u00a0 we left.\u00a0 We returned to the\u00a0 place where we were\u00a0 at first, where there were many camachili and other trees; at this time\u00a0 it\u00a0 was already daylight.\u00a0 The\u00a0 following day we went to work\u00a0 in the rice\u00a0 fields of Bacolog. We arrived at the house of Bacolog and we found Pinong, Abot, and Bacolog\u00a0 there,\u00a0 and our conversation there was not heard by Abot\u00a0 and Bacolog.\u00a0 When we arrived\u00a0 there they had not eaten\u00a0 yet.\u00a0 We worked on the pacteo\u00a0 (contract)\u00a0 for\u00a0 Bacolog\u00a0 for P12.25.\u00a0 Abot and Pinong\u00a0 cooked the rice, and then\u00a0 we\u00a0 all\u00a0 ate there.\u00a0 After we had eaten we went outside, and\u00a0 Pinong asked\u00a0 us why we had not killed him; Abot and Bacolog remained in the house.\u00a0 We answered him that\u00a0 we did not kill him because we were afraid of the bolo\u00a0 which he had.\u00a0 And\u00a0 while they\u00a0 were plowing we cleaned\u00a0 the grass away.\u00a0\u00a0 On that night we all slept\u00a0 in the house\u00a0 of\u00a0 Bacolog.\u00a0 The\u00a0 following day they plowed and we continued\u00a0 to clean the grass; we were in the house\u00a0 of Bacolog for\u00a0 three days.\u00a0 Pinong said to us now that we had finished we must go and kill him, because I am going to Ululing, because if I do not they may examine me.\u00a0 We finished about this time and we\u00a0 returned where we\u00a0 had been before where there were\u00a0 many camachili trees and bushes.\u00a0 On that day, as before, Petra brought us\u00a0 our food; at night\u00a0 we\u00a0 went to the house of Pinong to eat and Petra told us to go there to Tiburcio's house with the excuse to cook our rice.\u00a0 We arrived there with the\u00a0 excuse to cook as\u00a0 though we had\u00a0 just arrived from Cervantes, in fact that is what we told Tiburcio.\u00a0 After Laoyan had\u00a0 cooked the rice we went inside to\u00a0 eat, and after we had eaten we left the house and went outside of the house. And outside of the house we were in this position: Laoyan was sitting in front of Tiburcio; Udcusan was sitting to the left of Laoyan, and I, myself, was sitting over to one side of Tiburcio, and Dalocdoc was sitting near Udcusan.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 What\u00a0 else? = A. Laoyan was\u00a0 in\u00a0 front\u00a0 of\u00a0 Tiburcio talking to him because he could not\u00a0 defend himself, and this is\u00a0 what Pinong\u00a0 ordered us to\u00a0 do.\u00a0 We\u00a0 gave him a blow in the face and Udcusan struck him on the legs.\u00a0 We were the only two that struck him.\u00a0 We\u00a0 killed\u00a0 him and searched the\u00a0 house for the money which Pinong\u00a0 said was there and we\u00a0 could\u00a0 not find anything.\u00a0\u00a0 We asked the woman about the money which Pinong spoke about, but Salome said\u00a0 they used\u00a0 it to buy rice fields.\u00a0 The clothes the woman took, and the black shirt, which Pinong said we\u00a0 must leave there because it was worth\u00a0 much\u00a0 with the Christians, we could\u00a0 not find.\u00a0 We\u00a0 asked\u00a0 Salome\u00a0 about the shirt\u00a0 and she said\u00a0 yes\u00a0 it was true that there was a shirt there but that it\u00a0 was not in the house\u00a0 then but in the town.\u00a0 The\u00a0 chickens and the pigs which Pinong said we\u00a0 must leave there and the bolo also we did not touch. Pinong\u00a0 said to us: 'Leave the pigs and the chickens; do not take them away; leave part of the chickens because the\u00a0 people who will bury Tiburcio's body will have something to eat.'\u00a0 We only carried away\u00a0 the carabao because that is what Pinong had told us to do; he told us\u00a0 to carry away\u00a0 the\u00a0 carabao\u00a0 and the\u00a0 money,\u00a0 but the woman\u00a0 said there\u00a0 was no\u00a0 money\u00a0 there.\u00a0 He\u00a0 told us to\u00a0 carry away the carabao to our house and that after the\u00a0 palay was cut he would come there to get the carabao to bring it\u00a0 here to Cervantes\u00a0 to work.\u00a0 And he further told us that 'if you go in the road and the people come to catch you, you must run away although you may have to leave the carabao, because if\u00a0 they catch one of you it will be bad for us, and although they\u00a0 may bring the carabao here I will\u00a0 get\u00a0 it the following day and give it back\u00a0 to you.'\u00a0 We carried the carabao away, but we did not\u00a0 tie the woman up.\u00a0 Although the woman says that we\u00a0 tied her up\u00a0 it is not true, we did not tie her up.\u00a0 And Pinong said: 'After you have killed the man\u00a0 Petra will come to Ululing to tell me about it, and I will come from\u00a0 Ululing to report the matter\u00a0 and then you will be far away.'\u00a0\u00a0 We killed him, it is true,\u00a0 and Petra\u00a0 did not sleep because she was watching.\u00a0 Petra put out the light when we killed him.\u00a0 Salome, when we killed her husband,\u00a0 cried out.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 How did Salome cry out,\u00a0 and what did she say? - A.\u00a0 [Indicating by\u00a0 a\u00a0 horrified yell.]\u00a0\u00a0 And Pinong\u00a0 then further said: 'If you kill him I will get the rice fields,\u00a0 and when you come to Cervantes you must come to eat in my house.'\u00a0 We celebrated a <i>kanao <\/i> with the chickens of Pinong;\u00a0 we made a <i>kanao<\/i> in his\u00a0 house and ate all of the chickens.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 How niany chickens did you eat? - A. Five chickens. Everything that I have stated is\u00a0 true.\u00a0 And\u00a0 he said 'after you\u00a0 have seen\u00a0 the galls of the chickens if it\u00a0 is all right then go;' that is what he said to us; that is what Pinong said.\u00a0\u00a0 We\u00a0 did\u00a0 not\u00a0 see\u00a0 anybody else in the house.\u00a0\u00a0 We only saw the two whom\u00a0 I have\u00a0 mentioned.\u00a0 We took the chickens and went outside of his house to hide there.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. But\u00a0 whom did\u00a0 Pinong inform\u00a0 you\u00a0 that you must kill? - A. Pinong is\u00a0 the man who informed us of the sale of the\u00a0 house, and proposed that\u00a0 we must kill him for the amount of the sale of said house.\u00a0 And in regard to the amount of the house they did not give us anything.\"<\/blockquote>After this simple yet graphic description of the course of events from the inception of the crime to its commission, little more\u00a0 needs to he said\u00a0 as to the facts.\u00a0 The court below, after a careful review\u00a0 of all\u00a0 the\u00a0 evidence adduced at the trial, arrived at the conclusion that the story told by the Igorots was\u00a0 true.\u00a0\u00a0 We are satisfied that the court was right in that decision.\u00a0 There appear in the story told by these savage\u00a0 witnesses so many of the badges and indicia of truth as to\u00a0 leave in the mind no doubt concerning its substantial truthfulness.\u00a0\u00a0 Although the accused denies absolutely the testimony of these witnesses and states that he had never\u00a0 in his\u00a0 life seen them\u00a0 until they appeared against him in court, still their narrative of the facts discloses a\u00a0 knowledge of many matters so personal\u00a0 to\u00a0 the accused that it could have been acquired only through the most intimate relations\u00a0 between\u00a0 them.\u00a0 The sale\u00a0 of\u00a0 the house and\u00a0 lot\u00a0 by Tiburcio and that the accused received no part of the proceeds, the tilling of the land by him and accused in common, the\u00a0 black\u00a0 shirt in the possession\u00a0 of Tiburcio in\u00a0 which he was to be buried, the leaving of the pigs and chickens for those who should attend the funeral, that\u00a0 the accused was\u00a0 working for\u00a0 Bacolog and\u00a0 was\u00a0 at. Ululing during the\u00a0 days immediately prior to the murder, that the accused had a wife and that her name was Petra, the\u00a0 relationship\u00a0 between\u00a0 the\u00a0 accused and\u00a0 Tiburcio, and that the accused\u00a0 would be one of those to inherit the land of Tiburcio, all these facts the Igorots knew.\u00a0 From whom did\u00a0 they obtain\u00a0 this\u00a0 information ?\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 impossibility\u00a0 of answering this question otherwise than with the two words \"The accused,\" is, under the facts of this case, irrefragable corroboration\u00a0 of the testimony of the two hillmen.<br\/><br\/>This being\u00a0 so, the fact that the accused was the instigator and inducer of the\u00a0 crime charged appears so clearly as to require no discussion or argument.\u00a0\u00a0 (Supreme court of Spain, judgments of 20 October, 1881; 7 January, 1887; 12 January, 1899; Penal Code, art. 13.)<br\/><br\/>It now remains to inquire whether the sentence imposed by the court below was proper under the law.<br\/><br\/>Article 79 of the Penal Code reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Art. 79. The aggravating or extenuating circumstances that consist in the moral condition of the delinquent, in his private relations with the injured party, or in any other personal\u00a0 cause,\u00a0 shall serve\u00a0 to aggravate or diminish the liability of only the\u00a0 principals, accomplices, or accessaries who may be affected thereby.<br\/><br\/>\"The circumstances which consist in the material execution\u00a0 of the deed, or\u00a0 in the means employed to accomplish it, shall serve\u00a0 to aggravate or diminish the\u00a0 liability of those persons only\u00a0 who were acquainted with\u00a0 them at the moment of the commission\u00a0 of the crime, or of their cooperation therein.\"<\/blockquote>Commenting\u00a0 on this article, Groizard says, volume 2,\u00a0 page 362:<br\/><blockquote>\"A new limitation, a new reduction\u00a0 of the circle within which\u00a0 aggravating and\u00a0 extenuating\u00a0 circumstances\u00a0 may occur and\u00a0 be considered, is created by this article.<br\/><br\/>\"The circumstances attending the commission of a crime either <i>relate to the persons\u00a0 participating in the same, or to its material execution, or to the means employed.<\/i>\u00a0 The former do not\u00a0 affect\u00a0 all the participants in the crime,\u00a0 but only\u00a0 those\u00a0 to\u00a0 whom they\u00a0 particularly apply; the latter have\u00a0 a\u00a0 direct bearing upon the criminal liability of all\u00a0 the defendants who had knowledge thereof at the\u00a0 time of\u00a0 the commission of\u00a0 the crime, or of their cooperation therein.<br\/><br\/>\"The principle is clear and just.\u00a0 If the law had failed to expressly recognize it, it could be fairly inferred from the rational nature of\u00a0 the crime and\u00a0 its legal definition, from\u00a0 the scientific notion of the\u00a0 imputability and legal determination of the\u00a0 inherent liability\u00a0 of the authors,\u00a0 accomplices, and accessaries, from the general theory of. aggravating and\u00a0 extenuating\u00a0 circumstances, and from\u00a0 the peculiar nature of\u00a0 each of these as determined\u00a0 by the legislator in describing them.<br\/><br\/>\"Four malefactors commit homicide.\u00a0 One\u00a0 of them\u00a0 is under eighteen.\u00a0 Another is drunk.\u00a0 The third\u00a0 is a recidivist, and the other is neither under age nor drunk, nor guilty of any former crime.\u00a0 Are they equally liable?\u00a0 The first one has in his\u00a0 favor an extenuating circumstance, to wit, minority, which does not affect his codefendants.\u00a0 The second has another different circumstance in his favor, to wit, drunkenness, which\u00a0 does\u00a0 not extend\u00a0 to\u00a0 the other participants in the crime.\u00a0 The third has an aggravating circumstance which affects him only; and the fourth, finally, shall\u00a0 suffer\u00a0 the penalty\u00a0 corresponding\u00a0 to\u00a0 him without taking\u00a0 into\u00a0 consideration the\u00a0 aggravating\u00a0 circumstance which affects the one\u00a0 or the extenuating circumstances which affect the others.<br\/><br\/>\"Greater doubts, if not as to the principle itself, at least in the\u00a0 practical application of that principle,\u00a0 will arise under the second paragraph, which relates to the circumstances affecting the material execution of the deed, or to the means employed.\u00a0 Such\u00a0 circumstances under the\u00a0 law can only aggravate\u00a0 or mitigate the criminal\u00a0 liability of those who had knowledge of the same at the time of the commission of the crime, or of their cooperation therein.<br\/><br\/>\"The rule, of course,\u00a0 as stated long ago by one of our more able commentators (Pacheco), has no application as to extenuating circumstances.\u00a0 'The law\u00a0 - says the writer referred to - refers in the second paragraph of this section both to extenuating and aggravating circumstances.\u00a0 We who understand the theory of the latter, and can cite many instances\u00a0 regarding the same, are unable to\u00a0 understand the former, or to find a single instance in which they may apply.'<br\/><br\/>\"It is the same\u00a0 with us.\u00a0 During our long practice we have never yet found a single case in which this\u00a0 provision of the law has been\u00a0 invoked with reference to extenuating circumstances, and\u00a0 must confess that\u00a0 we are unable to conceive one in which\u00a0 it might be so invoked.\u00a0 In so far as relates to the means employed in the execution of the crime, and other acts incident to the actual perpetration thereof, it is impossible to conceive that any mitigating circumstance which can properly be considered as to one of the defendants, is not equally applicable to the others, even to those who had no knowledge of the same at the time of the commission of the crime, or of their cooperation therein.<br\/><br\/>\"The Neapolitan Code has recognized the difference which exists upon this point between extenuating and aggravating circumstances.\u00a0\u00a0 While it\u00a0 applies the rule provided in case of personal circumstances, to extenuating and aggravating circumstances, it limits the\u00a0 same to aggravating\u00a0 circumstances where they relate to the material execution of the crime.<br\/><br\/>\"It is to be regretted that our\u00a0 code does not contain a similar provision.\u00a0 In other respects it\u00a0 would\u00a0 be\u00a0 easy to give illustrations of the application of the rules under consideration.\u00a0 Two malefactors lay hands\u00a0 upon an agent of the authorities.\u00a0\u00a0 One of them\u00a0 is induced by a promise of reward by a third party, a\u00a0 fact of which his codefendant has no knowledge.\u00a0 That\u00a0 which constitutes an aggravating circumstance as to one of\u00a0 them does not apply to the other. A person induces others to commit the crime of abduction, or forcible entry of a dwelling.\u00a0 The latter in undertaking to commit\u00a0 the crime do so, employing, without the knowledge of the instigator of\u00a0 the deed, deceit, fraud, and disguise.\u00a0 They are all equally liable for the\u00a0 commission of the crime, but the aggravating circumstance referred to attending the material\u00a0 execution of the crime, shall only affect those who actually commit the deed.<br\/><br\/>\"We are fully aware of the fact, however, that notwithstanding the simplicity\u00a0 and justice of the rules contained in the said section, this will not always suffice to dissipate the shadow of the doubt which will arise in\u00a0 the minds of our courts\u00a0 when applying the same, particularly in certain difficult cases\u00a0 in which the so-called <i>qualifying<\/i> circumstances, according to most of the\u00a0 expounders of our law, play\u00a0 an important part.\u00a0\u00a0 But these objections are\u00a0 inevitable.\u00a0\u00a0 The letter of the law properly construed, the spirit of the same where the text is not clear,\u00a0 and the previous knowledge of the\u00a0 theories, sources, and origin\u00a0 of these legal\u00a0 provisions where the spirit and\u00a0 letter of the same may appear insufficient, are the only means which the courts have\u00a0 to comply with their mission in these and other similar cases.\u00a0 It is\u00a0 impossible for the law to cover\u00a0 every possible case that may arise.\u00a0 Wherever it attempts to do so it fails. Casuistry, which only furnishes a solution in certain specified cases, would take the place of the legal doctrine\u00a0 within the principles of which a satisfactory solution can always be found.\"<\/blockquote>The robbery and homicide were planned by the accused. He instructed the\u00a0 Igorots exactly how to\u00a0 accomplish them. The crime was carried\u00a0 out in perfect consonance with his instructions.\u00a0 By express arrangement with the hillmen the night was selected by the accused as the time for\u00a0 the commission of the crime, to the end that it might be the more easily committed and that the chances\u00a0 of discovery might be minimized.\u00a0 Under the provisions of\u00a0 the article above quoted, we are of the opinion that the aggravating circumstance of nocturnity must be imputed to the\u00a0 defendant, nocturnity being one of the circumstances in the\u00a0 material execution of the deed and one of the means employed to accomplish its commission, and he, at the time of the commission of the crime and before, being acquainted with that circumstance and of the fact of its use in the commission of the crime.\u00a0 (Supreme court of\u00a0 Spain, judgment of 12 January, 1899.)\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, there must be imputed\u00a0 to the accused in this case the aggravating circumstance of premeditation.\u00a0\u00a0 While premeditation is an inherent and integral element or quality of the crime of robbery and therefore can not, in that crime, be used as an aggravating circumstance (United States <i> vs. <\/i>Castroverde,\u00a0 4 Phil.\u00a0 Rep., 246; United States<i> vs<\/i>. Blanco,\u00a0 10 Phil.\u00a0 Rep., 298), such is nqt the case in regard to the crime of robbery with homicide as defined in articles 502 and\u00a0 503 of the Penal Code.\u00a0 In that crime premeditation, if it is present, may be used as an aggravating\u00a0 circumstance\u00a0 (supreme court\u00a0 of Spain, judgments of 7 January, 1887, and 22 November, 1900) to augment the penalty to be\u00a0 imposed.\u00a0 This doctrine meets our approval upon principle.\u00a0\u00a0 That there was, in the case at bar, the element of premeditation is too clear for discussion.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<br\/><br\/>We have delayed until this moment the discussion of the questions raised by appellant's counsel respecting the irregularities which he claims were present in the arrest, arraignment, and trial of the accused.\u00a0\u00a0 His assignments of error upon that branch of his appeal are:<br\/><blockquote>\"1. That the warrant was issued without probable cause and was not supported by oath or affirmation and was issued without due process of law.<br\/><br\/>\"2. The pretended <i>querella<\/i>\u00a0 upon which the\u00a0 defendant was tried is not verified or based upon a preliminary examination as provided by law.<br\/><br\/>\"3. That\u00a0 the pretended querella does not conform substantially to the prescribed form.<br\/><br\/>\"4. That the pretended querella does\u00a0 not state facts sufficient to constitute the crime of <i>robo\u00a0 con homicidio\u00a0 por induccion.\"<\/i><\/blockquote>A detailed examination of the record\u00a0 before us discloses that from the time of the arrest of the\u00a0 defendant until the termination of\u00a0 his\u00a0 trial no\u00a0 objection was made to\u00a0 any of the processes or pleadings,\u00a0 except that, at the\u00a0 beginning of the trial, the defendant's counsel interposed a demurrer to the complaint \"because it does not set forth any intent of gain or that any gain was to be got\u00a0 out of this robbery by the accused\u00a0 in this case, Rufino Ancheta.\"\u00a0\u00a0 Giving the objection the full force\u00a0 and\u00a0 effect of a demurrer, it is still evident that it\u00a0 is without legal basis as it appears, from what has been said heretofore, that it is wholly immaterial whether or\u00a0 not the accused intended or expected to gain financially by the commission of the crime.<br\/><br\/>This being the only objection taken by the defendant during the whole course of the trial, we hold that the questions presented by the assignments above quoted can not be heard here.\u00a0 Objections not having been presented opportunely, such defects, if any, as the assignments indicate, were waived.\u00a0 Moreover, sections 9 and 10 of the Code of Criminal Procedure read as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"SEC. 9. The information or complaint may be amended in\u00a0 substance or form, without leave of court, at any time before\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant pleads;\u00a0 and thereafter, during the trial, as to all matters of form, at the discretion of the court, when the same can be done without prejudice to the rights of the defendant.<br\/><br\/>\"SEC. 10. No information or complaint is insufficient nor can the trial, judgment, or other proceedings be affected by reason\u00a0 of a defect in matter of form which\u00a0 does not tend to prejudice a\u00a0 substantial right of the defendant upon the merits.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>No defect of form\u00a0 or substance existed in the complaint or information which is not cured by these provisions.\u00a0 No accused person may\u00a0 be heard\u00a0 to\u00a0 challenge any\u00a0 process, pleading, proceeding\u00a0 or decision\u00a0 in the courts of these Islands on account of any defect or irregularity which does not prejudice a substantial right upon the merits.<br\/><br\/>Many of\u00a0 the questions raised by the defendant in his assignments of error\u00a0 have been passed\u00a0 upon by this court in the case of United\u00a0 States <i>vs.<\/i> Wilson (4 Phil. Rep., 317).<br\/><br\/>The guilt of the defendant as a principal in the crime having\u00a0 been clearly established and there being present at the commission of the crime the aggravating circumstances of premeditation\u00a0 and nocturnity, with no extenuating circumstance, the penalty should have been imposed in its maximum degree.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below is reversed and the defendant is hereby found guilty of the crime of robbery with homicide as defined in articles 502 and 503\u00a0 of the Penal Code, and he is hereby condemned to the penalty of death, the accessories of article 53 of the Penal Code, to indemnify the heirs at law and next of kin of Tiburcio Ancheta in the sum of one thousand pesos\u00a0 (P1,000) and to pay\u00a0 the costs of this appeal.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

On the 11th of\u00a0 July,\u00a0 1908, the bodies of these two persons, Pasia and his son,\u00a0 were found in a small forest within the jurisdiction of\u00a0 their town\u00a0 of Ibaan.\u00a0\u00a0 On\u00a0 examination\u00a0 of these bodies\u00a0 it was found that Nicomedes Pasia had\u00a0 a wound which\u00a0 almost separated his head into two parts; another wound in his side,\u00a0 and one in the\u00a0 abdomen which partly disemboweled him.\u00a0\u00a0 On the body of the little boy, Candido, was found a wound which almost separated his head from his\u00a0 body, and\u00a0 another\u00a0 which\u00a0 partly disemboweled him.\u00a0\u00a0 The two bodies were about two\u00a0 brazas apart.\u00a0 The bodies\u00a0 were searched and\u00a0 no money or other valuables found on them. Nicomedes Pasia was a man, the head of a family, and his son, Candido, was only about twelve years of age.<br\/><br\/>This defendant was arrested in Infanta in one of the last months\u00a0 of the year 1909 and taken to the Province of Tayabas, where the provincial fiscal subsequently thereto, and on the 6th of January, 1910, filed a complaint against him, charging him\u00a0 with\u00a0 the crime\u00a0 of robbery with homicide, alleging that the accused and one Filomeno Torres\u00a0 accompanied the two deceased from the town of Pagsanjan, Province of La Laguna, and on arriving in the barrio of Santo Nino, municipality of Ibaan, Province of Batangas,\u00a0 on a Friday\u00a0 about the middle\u00a0 of\u00a0 July,\u00a0 1908,\u00a0 and in an\u00a0 uninhabited\u00a0 place, did maliciously, criminally, and with the object of robbing Nicomedes Pasia, murder the\u00a0 said\u00a0 Pasia and his son, taking from Nicomedes Pasia the sum of P500, all contrary to article 503 of the Penal Code.<br\/><br\/>The trial court after hearing1\u00a0 the evidence adduced and the arguments of counsel, sentenced this defendant, on the 5th of February, 1910,\u00a0 to be hanged by the neck until dead, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of Pl,000, and to pay the costs.\u00a0 The case is now before us <i>en consulta<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>At\u00a0 the\u00a0 time this\u00a0 defendant was tried, Filomeno\u00a0 Torres had not been captured.<br\/><br\/>The first witness\u00a0 for the\u00a0 prosecution, Santos\u00a0 Pasia, a brother of the deceased Nicomedes Pasia, testified that on a Wednesday in\u00a0 the\u00a0 month of July, 1908, he was with the deceased in Santa Cruz, Province of La\u00a0 Laguna,\u00a0 where they spent that night together in a certain house there; that on that night the defendant and Filomeno\u00a0 Torres came to this house\u00a0 and saw\u00a0 the\u00a0 deceased\u00a0 Nicomedes Pasia count his money, which amounted to P540.50; that when the defendant and Torres arrived at the house where they were staying that night, and after they saw the deceased Nicomedes count the money, the defendant, Albino Magtibay, stated to Nicomedes Pasia that as he\u00a0 had been absent\u00a0 from his town for a long time\u00a0 he was going to accompany the deceased and his son to their town; that\u00a0 very early on the following morning the two deceased, accompanied by this defendant and Filomeno\u00a0\u00a0 Torres,\u00a0 embarked on\u00a0 a steamer which\u00a0 sailed\u00a0 for Calamba.<br\/><br\/>The witness Pioquinto Torano testified that\u00a0 about dusk on a\u00a0 Thursday,\u00a0 while\u00a0 he was on his way\u00a0 from Ibaan to Lipa,\u00a0 he met the two deceased in company with the defendant and Torres,\u00a0 going\u00a0 toward Ibaan; that\u00a0 he knew all of these\u00a0 parties and that they were carrying small\u00a0 bundles.<br\/><br\/>Mariano Magabo,\u00a0 another witness for the prosecution, testified that about daybreak on\u00a0 a Friday morning he met the two deceased in the\u00a0 barrio of Adia, municipality of Lipa, in company with this defendant and Torres,\u00a0 and\u00a0 that on the following\u00a0 day he was informed of the\u00a0 death of these two deceased.<br\/><br\/>Antonio Mapalat testified that on a Friday in the month of July, 1908, shortly after sunrise, he met the two deceased, in company with\u00a0 the defendant and\u00a0 Filomeno Torres, in a small forest, within the jurisdiction\u00a0 of the town of Ibaan, the deceased Nicomedes Pasia, the defendant, and\u00a0 Torres each carrying small bundles; that a few\u00a0 moments after passing these parties he heard the little boy cry out:\u00a0 \"Why are you killing my father?\"\u00a0 That on hearing this\u00a0 cry he turned back, looked over the small hill, and saw Nicomedes on the ground covered with blood and this defendant pursuing the little boy,\u00a0 and that on account of fear he continued his\u00a0 march to Lipa.<br\/><br\/>Ambrosio Calalog testified\u00a0 that\u00a0 about 10\u00a0 o'clock\u00a0 on the morning of a Friday in July, 1908, he\u00a0 saw the defendant and Filomeno Torres\u00a0 in\u00a0 a small\u00a0 forest;\u00a0 that at that time\u00a0 he noticed blood on the clothes of Filomeno Torres; and that these two men were traveling very fast\u00a0 in the direction of the barrio of Putol of that town.<br\/><br\/>Serapio\u00a0 Pansoy, another\u00a0 witness for the\u00a0 prosecution, testified that about 12 o'clock on a Friday, the 10th of July, 1908, while\u00a0 he was in a restaurant in the town of Rosario he met the\u00a0 defendant and Filomeno Torres, who were quite well known\u00a0 to him and who had just arrived at that place in a calesa; that\u00a0 they asked him what he was doing there and he replied that he was on his way to San Pablo.\u00a0 They then said to him: \"Don't say anything to\u00a0 anyone\u00a0 in\u00a0 our barrio that you saw us here.\"<br\/><br\/>Two policemen\u00a0 of the town of Ibaan\u00a0 testified that they had been looking for the defendant for a long time in order to arrest him on this charge.\u00a0\u00a0 One of these\u00a0 policemen testified that the order of arrest was issued on the very day the bodies of the\u00a0 deceased were found in that barrio,\u00a0 but they did not state\u00a0 on what\" information the\u00a0 order of arrest was issued.\u00a0 It is\u00a0 evident, however, that some information was\u00a0 had at that\u00a0 time which\u00a0 was sufficient to order\u00a0 the arrest of this defendant.<br\/><br\/>The accused, testifying in his own behalf, stated that in the month of July, 1908,\u00a0 he was living in Infanta, in the town of Binangonan; that\u00a0 he had been\u00a0 absent from his town for\u00a0 more than three years when he was arrested in Binangonan, in\u00a0 one of the\u00a0 last months of the year 1908, having spent these three years in the said town of Binangonan.\u00a0 On being asked the ages of his children he stated that his youngest child was twenty-two months old when this trial took place.\u00a0 He\u00a0 was then asked to explain how it was possible for him to be\u00a0 the father of this child when he had been absent and had not seen his wife for more than three years.\u00a0\u00a0 He failed to answer this question.\u00a0\u00a0 The defendant also testified that\u00a0 when he left his home he carried with him\u00a0 about P1,000 worth of cloth to sell, he\u00a0 being a peddler; that he sold this\u00a0 cloth and lost the greater part of the money gambling,\u00a0 and\u00a0 for this\u00a0 reason\u00a0 he was ashamed to return\u00a0 to his home.\u00a0 He\u00a0 further testified\u00a0 that while in Binangonan he worked part of the time for the president there at a salary of P30\u00a0 a\u00a0 month.\u00a0\u00a0 This\u00a0 president, Pablo Astillo,\u00a0 having been\u00a0 called\u00a0 as a witness\u00a0 for the\u00a0 defense, testified that\u00a0 it was\u00a0 a fact that\u00a0 the defendant did work for him in April and May of 1909 and also\u00a0 in September and October of\u00a0 the same year at P15 a month; and that when the defendant\u00a0 came to work\u00a0 for him he gave his name as Segundo Maghinay.<br\/><br\/>Faustino Ravino and Eduardo Clado, two other witnesses for the defense,\u00a0 were called and testified\u00a0 that they were peddlers and from the same\u00a0 town of Ibaan; that they were in Binangonan about\u00a0 the time the two deceased were killed and, according to the testimony of these two witnesses, it would have been impossible for the accused to have\u00a0 been in Ibaan at\u00a0 the time of the murder.\u00a0 But on a close examination\u00a0 of this testimony it is very clear\u00a0 that they were not\u00a0 testifying the\u00a0 truth.\u00a0 They knew no days whatever except the ones they must give so as to have the defendant in Infanta at\u00a0 the time of the murder.\u00a0 They were unable to tell how they traveled from Ibaan and Lipa to Calamba and then\u00a0 to Infanta.\u00a0\u00a0 They differed very much as to the places they stopped and\u00a0 as\u00a0 to\u00a0 the\u00a0 towns in which they peddled.\u00a0\u00a0 They said that\u00a0 they went in a carromata on a road that was shown to be utterly impassable for a vehicle on account of its running through the mountains and being nothing more than a trail.\u00a0\u00a0 They made different statements about the town of\u00a0 Mauban, a place\u00a0 where they said they stayed one or two days peddling.\u00a0 One of them said that this town\u00a0 was about a mile from the\u00a0 beach and the other said it was less\u00a0 than\u00a0 half a mile.\u00a0 The\u00a0 town, as a matter of fact, is right on the beach.<br\/><br\/>During the pendency of\u00a0 this case in the Supreme Court a motion was filed, on the 25th of August, 1910, asking for the reopening of the\u00a0 case\u00a0 for the presentation of newly discovered evidence.\u00a0\u00a0 The newly discovered\u00a0 evidence\u00a0 which forms the basis of\u00a0 this\u00a0 motion consists of\u00a0 a certified copy of the testimony\u00a0 of Ambrosio\u00a0 Galalog and Santos Pasia given before the justice of the peace of the town of Ibaan on the 14th\u00a0 of July,\u00a0 1908.\u00a0 It appears that shortly after the bodies of\u00a0 the two deceased persons were found the justice. of the peace of that town held an investigation to ascertain, if possible, the authors of that crime,\u00a0 and during this investigation these\u00a0 two witnesses appeared and testified before him.\u00a0 In\u00a0 this\u00a0 preliminary investigation, according to the certified copies of the testimony, Pasia testified that he in company with the\u00a0 two\u00a0 deceased\u00a0 left their town on the 7th of May, 1908,\u00a0 for the Province of La Laguna for the purpose of selling cloth; that\u00a0 when\u00a0 they arrived in Pagsanjan of that province and after staying there a week they separated, the two deceased\u00a0 going to the town\u00a0 of Cabinti; that about the\u00a0 end of May he returned to Ibaan without waiting for the two deceased; that he\u00a0 had\u00a0 no notice of anyone accompanying\u00a0 them to\u00a0 Ibaan; and that he knew\u00a0 nothing about the killing of the two deceased.\u00a0 This testimony of Santos Pasia contradicts on some important\u00a0 and material points the testimony given by\u00a0 him\u00a0 during the trial.\u00a0 In the investigation he stated that he returned to his town the last of May, while on the trial in the court below he stated that he returned toward the latter part of July.\u00a0 He further stated during: the trial that he saw the two deceased in Santa Cruz on a Wednesday night when the defendant and Filomeno Torres came to the house where they were staying and that the following morning the two deceased,\u00a0 together with the defendant and Torres, left Santa Cruz for Calamba on the same steamer.\u00a0 But even admitting that he testified as stated in\u00a0 this certificate his testimony during the trial Would not be destroyed for the reason that such testimony is so thoroughly corroborated.\u00a0 When he gave this declaration before the justice of the peace the defendant and his companion had not been arrested, and it is\u00a0 not difficult to understand why a witness under these circumstances\u00a0 would hesitate to implicate these men in so serious a crime.<br\/><br\/>The other\u00a0 witness in this\u00a0 investigation testified that he lived in\u00a0 the barrio\u00a0 of Santo\u00a0 Nino, municipality of Ibaan; that the\u00a0 bodies of the deceased were found more than three hundred\u00a0 brazas distant\u00a0 from\u00a0 his house; that he\u00a0 knew nothing of\u00a0 his own\u00a0 knowledge as to the cause of the death of these\u00a0 parties, while on\u00a0 the trial he testified that he saw the defendant and\u00a0 Torres on a Friday morning about 10 o'clock in the month of July and noticed blood on the clothes of Torres. There is\u00a0 no material contradiction in\u00a0 the\u00a0 testimony of\u00a0 this\u00a0 witness, as he\u00a0 did not\u00a0 state that he saw the defendant and his companion commit this murder but only saw them in the small forest on that morning,\u00a0 so his testimony,\u00a0 given during the\u00a0 trial, would not be weakened if his testimony given in the preliminary investigation were admitted to be true.\u00a0 He was not asked during the preliminary investigation\u00a0 if he\u00a0 had seen this defendant at any time or place on or\u00a0 about the 10th of July, but he was only asked if\u00a0 he had any personal\u00a0 knowledge as to who was the perpetrator of this crime.\u00a0 He did not have any\u00a0 actual personal\u00a0 knowledge of the crime or the\u00a0 cause of the\u00a0 death of these\u00a0 two. deceased, but\u00a0 only saw the defendant and Torres in that\u00a0 immediate vicinity on the same day that these parties were killed.\u00a0 He did not then know that the two deceased had been killed on that day.\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation made by the justice of the peace being so\u00a0 superficial we believe that the testimony of this witness would not be discredited even admitting that he so testified before the justice of the peace.<br\/><br\/>The defendant and Torres were seen in company with the two deceased between Lipa and Ibaan by the witness Torano. They were also\u00a0 seen by the witness Magabo about daybreak on a\u00a0 Friday morning in\u00a0 the barrio of\u00a0 Adia in company with the two deceased.\u00a0 These four men were seen together on the following morning\u00a0 by Mapalat, and this witness on hearing the little\u00a0 boy cry out, \"Why\u00a0 are\u00a0 you killing my father?\" saw Nicomedes Pasia on the ground covered with blood\u00a0 and the defendant pursuing the little boy.\u00a0 The bodies of these two parties were found in that same locality.\u00a0\u00a0 This testimony is direct and positive.\u00a0\u00a0 It is also corroborated by the testimony of Calalog, who saw the defendant and Torres in that vicinity on that Friday\u00a0 morning.\u00a0 These same two men were seen by Pan soy in a restaurant on that same day. The defendant was not seen in that vicinity after that time until he was brought back to that province for trial over a year later.\u00a0\u00a0 The police of Ibaan had been looking for him during this time.<br\/><br\/>When Nicomedes Pasia\u00a0 and his little son left their home they carried with\u00a0 them over P600 worth of cloth.\u00a0\u00a0 When their bodies were examined\u00a0 nothing of value was found on them.\u00a0 The cloth had disappeared and also its value.\u00a0 The evident motive\u00a0 which moved this defendant and his companion to kill these people\u00a0 was in order to obtain possession of their valuables.\u00a0 This\u00a0 is a clear case of robbery with double homicide.\u00a0 In the commission of this crime there were present no\u00a0 extenuating circumstances.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 aggravating circumstance of <i>despoblado<\/i> has\u00a0 been\u00a0 clearly established, inasmuch as it has been shown that this crime was committed in a small\u00a0 forest where there were\u00a0 no houses and no one living near.\u00a0 This location was purposely and deliberately selected for the commission of this crime in\u00a0 order to avoid detection.\u00a0 These facts fully comply with the provisions of the law for the establishment of this aggravating circumstance.\u00a0\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Salgado,\u00a0 11\u00a0 Phil.\u00a0 Rep.,\u00a0 56). There was likewise present in the commission of this\u00a0 crime the aggravating circumstance of superior strength,\u00a0 as it has been shown that the little boy was only\u00a0 about twelve years of age.\u00a0 The defendant and his companion took advantage of the weakness and tender\u00a0 age of\u00a0 this child to dispose of him in order, no doubt, that he could not appear as a witness against them.\u00a0 This crime\u00a0 was deliberately planned by this defendant\u00a0 and\u00a0 his\u00a0 companion.\u00a0 They saw the deceased Nicomedes count his money in Santa Cruz and at that time the defendant manifested his intention of\u00a0 going to his home town in company with the deceased.\u00a0 He carried out this plan and\u00a0 when they\u00a0 were alone\u00a0 in a\u00a0 small forest he, assisted by his companion\u00a0 Filomeno Torres, deliberately and with known premeditation took the lives of these two people in order to appropriate this money.<br\/><br\/>It having been established beyond any question of\u00a0 doubt that Albino Magtibay and his companion Filomeno Torres on the morning\u00a0 of the 10th of July, 1908, did with deadly weapons take the lives of\u00a0 Nicomedes Pasia and his son Candido for the purpose of appropriating to their\u00a0 own\u00a0 use the money which Nicomedes then had, and this crime having been committed with the concurrence of\u00a0 the\u00a0 aggravating circumstances above designated, by the very force of the law.the penalty, as provided in article\u00a0 503, paragraph 1, of the Penal Code, must be and was very properly imposed upon this\u00a0 defendant in its maximum degree.\u00a0\u00a0 The penalty of death imposed by the trial court being in accordance with the law and\u00a0 the merits\u00a0 of this case, the same is hereby affirmed, with costs against the appellant.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Arellano,\u00a0 C.\u00a0 J., Torres, Johnson,\u00a0<\/span> and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Moreland, JJ.<\/span>, concur.<br\/><\/div>",

Macondray &amp; Co., one of the business\u00a0 firms of this city, as agents at this port of the steamer <i>Muncaster Castle<\/i>, having to unload from the said vessel, which had come from New York and was\u00a0 anchored in Cavite Bay, a case\u00a0 of machinery\u00a0 weighing 25\u00a0 tons, consigned\u00a0 to\u00a0 The Manila Electric Railroad and Light Company, accepted the offer of the <i>lorcha Marte,<\/i>\u00a0 made to them by the plaintiffs, Rocha &amp; Co., a mercantile\u00a0 copartnership company, also of this city,\u00a0 and owned by the latter, in\u00a0 order\u00a0 that the said case of machinery might be unloaded onto the lorcha and transported from Cavite Bay to this port.<br\/><br\/>\"2. Between 4 and 5 o'clock of the afternoon\u00a0 of the 14th of April,\u00a0 1908 - that is, three days\u00a0 after Messrs.\u00a0 Macondray &amp; Co. received\u00a0 the offer made by Rocha &amp; Co. of the l<i>orcha Marte<\/i> - and while\u00a0 proceeding\u00a0 with the operation of transferring the said case of machinery from the\u00a0 hold of the vessel before mentioned\u00a0 to the deck of the <i>lorcha Marte,<\/i> using for this purpose the said vessel's\u00a0 main mast and spar,\u00a0 the latter attached to\u00a0 the former like a derrick, and while the said case was suspended above the starboard side of the <i>lorcha<\/i> at a height of from\u00a0 18 inches to 2\u00a0 feet, the pulleys or links\u00a0 of the chain or cable which\u00a0 fastened the said mast broke, causing the latter, with\u00a0 the\u00a0 spar, to lean toward the side where the case was\u00a0 and to break, letting the case fall onto that part of the said craft - that is, the starboard side - the. fall at the\u00a0 same time\u00a0 causing the <i>lorcha<\/i>\u00a0 to incline to that side, with\u00a0 danger of the case going into\u00a0 the water.<br\/><br\/>\"3, To avoid this, and also to save the<i> lorcha<\/i> from the danger it was in, as it had begun to leak in consequence of the blow\u00a0 it received from the \"fall\u00a0 of the\u00a0 case,\u00a0 and\u00a0 on account of its\u00a0 being\u00a0 somewhat under\u00a0 water on the said starboard\u00a0 side, they\u00a0 proceeded, under\u00a0 the\u00a0 orders of the captain of the steamer, to fasten both the\u00a0 case and the <i>lorcha <\/i>to the side of the vessel by means of ropes and wire cables, the\u00a0 case remaining there in that condition until the following day, when it was extracted, by means of a large floating crane, by The Manila Electric Railroad and Light Company, the consignee of the said\u00a0 case, and transported to this port of Manila in another vessel.<br\/><br\/>\"4. Macondray &amp; Co. not having adopted any determination whatever with respect to the <i>lorcha<\/i>, notwithstanding that they were notified of the accident by Rocha &amp; Co.,\u00a0 it remained fastened, by means of ropes and cables as before stated, to the side of\u00a0 the <i>Muncaster Castle,<\/i> though sunken to the level of the sea on account of leakage and the\u00a0 damage consequent upon the loss of the hatches, until the morning of the 19th of April - that is, for five days after the accident occurred - when the said Rocha &amp; Co.\u00a0 proceeded to salve the said <i>lorcha<\/i> and to remove it to a shipyard of this city where\u00a0 repairs were made thereto, the cost of which, added to the\u00a0 expenses of salvage and the losses in\u00a0 the\u00a0 collection of freight\u00a0 charges from\u00a0 the\u00a0 14th to the 30th.\u00a0 of April, amounted to the total\u00a0 sum of P2,493, according to the document, Exhibit A, which accompanied the complaint.<br\/><br\/>\"Rocha &amp; Co. alleged in the fifth paragraph of their said complaint that the cause of the breaking of the cables and the main\u00a0 mast, which\u00a0 constituted the\u00a0 apparatus\u00a0 for the raising and discharge\u00a0 of the case, was the latter's enormous weight of 27 tons, a\u00a0 weight heavier than\u00a0 the main mast and the cables could support and resist on account of their condition, the insufficiency of the said vessel's\u00a0 unloading apparatus, and the failure on the. part of the\u00a0 captain and the employees and crew under his orders to\u00a0 adopt any measures or means which ordinary prudence counseled to previously make sure of the sufficiency, resistance, and good condition of the apparatus employed to perform the operation effected without the probability of the\u00a0 occurrence\u00a0 of the accident which\u00a0 happened.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 plaintiffs,\u00a0 therefore,\u00a0 prayed\u00a0 that judgment be rendered against the defendants for the\u00a0 said sum of P2,493, as an indemnity for losses and\u00a0 damages, with interest and costs.<br\/><br\/>\"From\u00a0 the evidence adduced, however, it was proved that the operation of unloading the\u00a0 said case, or of its\u00a0 transportation\u00a0 from\u00a0 the steamer <i>Muncaster Castle<\/i> to the deck of the <i>lorcha Marte<\/i>, was performed under the supervision of the\u00a0 captain\u00a0 of the\u00a0 steamer, Percy\u00a0 Watson, and of a stevedore, a representative\u00a0 of William\u00a0 Sherman,\u00a0 after\u00a0 the said stevedore had tested the apparatus by means of which the said case\u00a0 was\u00a0 removed\u00a0 from the hold of the\u00a0 aforesaid vessel\u00a0 without any difficulty or mishap whatever.\u00a0 There is absolutely\u00a0 no proof that the said\u00a0 operation\u00a0 was conducted\u00a0 in an inappropriate manner or that\u00a0 means were employed\u00a0 which could have resulted in the accident.<br\/><br\/>\"On the\u00a0 contrary,\u00a0 it\u00a0 was\u00a0 shown by the testimony of Captain Watson himself, not rebutted at the trial by the plaintiff's\u00a0 counsel,\u00a0 that,\u00a0 although both\u00a0 in loading and unloading cargo of\u00a0 that\u00a0 weight they had sometimes used, especially\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 port\u00a0 of\u00a0 New York,\u00a0 floating cranes or derricks, because of their having a contract for this purpose, the employment of other means\u00a0 being considered harmful, nevertheless they had\u00a0 often used for such\u00a0 operations the spar or yard and the mast, even for larger weights; that in Japan they unloaded by this means two locomotives,\u00a0 whose boilers weighed 28 tons, and also in Manila Bay, three days before the accident, cast-iron cannons and boilers weighing 28 and\u00a0 22 tons,\u00a0 respectively, with the\u00a0 sole difference that this freight was unloaded from the port side of the vessel, while the case in question was taken off from the starboard side.<br\/><br\/>\"The\u00a0 record\u00a0 likewise shows,\u00a0 by the testimony\u00a0 given by Captain Watson, with no evidence\u00a0 whatever to\u00a0 the contrary, that he\u00a0 made sure,\u00a0 before attempting to unload, that the mast and the cables were able to resist the weight of the 27-ton case.\u00a0\u00a0 This same witness moreover testified that the pulleys and\u00a0 cogwheels, and\u00a0 the wires of the said apparatus, had\u00a0 been thoroughly tested\u00a0 and could bear a weight of 50 tons; that he had a certificate from the Government which stated that the\u00a0 said\u00a0 apparatus could support such a weight,\u00a0 although, he added,\u00a0 he\u00a0 could\u00a0 not be held responsible for any\u00a0 defects which\u00a0 afterwards\u00a0 might\u00a0 be found and were not visible in the apparatus mentioned or which existed inside of the mast at the time of its construction.\u00a0 This mast was made entirely of steel.<br\/><br\/>\"It is true that the stevedore, William Sherman, a witness for the defendants, who arrived at the steamer <i>Muncaster Castle<\/i>\u00a0 one hour and\u00a0 fifteen minutes after the accident,\u00a0 for he had his representative, Mr. Farris,\u00a0 there when the said operation of unloading was performed, testified at the trial that he thought that they\u00a0 intended\u00a0 to put into the said apparatus\u00a0 a load of greater weight than the mast could\u00a0 resist, giving it to be understood by this, perhaps, that\u00a0 it was\u00a0 due to this\u00a0 excess in weight of\u00a0 the load that\u00a0 the mast\u00a0 broke.\u00a0 It is also\u00a0 true that Tomas Felipe, a witness for the plaintiffs and\u00a0 customs inspector who was on the vessel Muncaster Castle at the time and was present at the accident,\u00a0 in referring to the unloading of four cannons\u00a0 in Manila Bay by means of the same mast and\u00a0 spar\u00a0 that\u00a0 is, the identical cannons referred to by Captain Watson of the said\u00a0 steamer - testified\u00a0 that on the occasion\u00a0 mentioned the load lowered 2 inches because of the lowering of the ring which held the derrick.<br\/><br\/>\"But it is to be borne in mind that the testimony of this second witness,\u00a0 Tomas Felipe,\u00a0 has\u00a0 but\u00a0 little or\u00a0 no importance in the\u00a0 present case to enable a conclusion to be drawn therefrom\u00a0 that\u00a0 the mast, the spar, or any\u00a0 of the component parts of the said unloading apparatus was\u00a0 in bad condition, inasmuch\u00a0 as such testimony is\u00a0 incredible, for in the matter of a load such as is inferred from a bulk like that of a\u00a0 cannon of 22 tons in weight it is not\u00a0 understood how nor why the said witness could have\u00a0 observed that the load\u00a0 had lowered so\u00a0 small a\u00a0 space as that of 2 inches, a space imperceptible and inestimable, particularly if we consider the movements\u00a0 made in operations of that kind; but be that\u00a0 as it may, such a statement made by a person who is not, like this witness, an expert, and without being in any\u00a0 manner corroborated at the trial,\u00a0 can not serve as a foundation whereupon to conclude with certainty that such a defect\u00a0 did exist\u00a0 in the apparatus,\u00a0 and consequently,\u00a0 that\u00a0 there was negligence\u00a0 or\u00a0 carelessness\u00a0 on the\u00a0 part of the captain\u00a0 of the <i>Muncaster Castle<\/i> by his again employing the said apparatus for the unloading of the case in question, several days afterwards, without taking such defect into account, or without having corrected it.<br\/><br\/>\"With respect to the\u00a0 opinion expressed by the stevedore Sherman, a person of expert knowledge in this matter,\u00a0 it is to be taken into account that the original and\u00a0 primary cause of the accident was the breaking of two pulleys which held the mast fast, to which\u00a0 was attached the\u00a0 spar,\u00a0 as Captain\u00a0 Watson testified, and\u00a0 this\u00a0 was also given to\u00a0 be understood by the very witness of the plaintiffs, Tomas Felipe, in testifying that\u00a0 on that occasion, while\u00a0 the case was hoisted to the side of the ship, one of the rings burst and\u00a0 the mast\u00a0 buckled or bent downwards.\u00a0 The stevedore Farris testified that\u00a0 'before the case could be put\u00a0 into a good position\u00a0 to let it fall or\u00a0 to place it upon the <i>lorcha,<\/i> two\u00a0 links of the chain\u00a0 and an eyebolt\u00a0 broke, leaving the mast without\u00a0 any\u00a0 support,\u00a0 for they followed\u00a0 the ropes,' the result being, according to this same\u00a0 witness, that, with the rising and falling of the <i>lorcha <\/i>and the case, due to the movement of the sea, the mast followed the same motion and\u00a0 fell.\u00a0\u00a0 This witness Farris\u00a0 added that, in his\u00a0 opinion, there must have been some invisible defect in the manufacture of the bolts, the nut, and the links of the chain.<br\/><br\/>\"The original and primary cause of the accident, then, did not consist in the breaking of the mast, but in the breaking of two pulleys or two links and an eyebolt of the chain sustaining the mast, which\u00a0 caused the spar\u00a0 and the mast to\u00a0 be drawn downwards by the weight of the case, and the mast, left without support on account of the breakage of the said pulteys or links, also broke.\u00a0\u00a0 It is therefore evident that no consideration can be given to the opinion expressed by the stevedore, Mr. Sherman, with respect to the small resisting power of the mast to carry a weight heavier than it could support, an opinion given in order to lead to the conclusion that tfce accident was due to the breaking of the\u00a0 mast in question,\u00a0 because of its\u00a0 being unable to resist so heavy a weight as that of the 25-ton case; and it is perfectly well understood\u00a0 that\u00a0 such\u00a0 a deduction\u00a0 can\u00a0 not\u00a0 be\u00a0 reached, because,\u00a0 in the case under consideration, if the two pulleys of the mast, as Captain Watson testified, or the two links and an eyebolt of the chain,\u00a0 according to Stevedore Farris's testimony, had not broken, it is obvious that the mast would not have broken, because the said chain or eyebolt was what sustained the mast which, left without\u00a0 support, due to the weight of the case, necessarily had to break, as it could not maintain\u00a0 itself in a\u00a0 position perpendicular to the ship's deck.<br\/><br\/>\"Briefly, the logical and reasonable conclusion to be drawn from the facts hereinbefore related, in connection with the fact of the said mast and spar having been\u00a0 used by\u00a0 Captain Watson\u00a0 on other occasions\u00a0 and three days before\u00a0 for the unloading of effects\u00a0 of equal weight,\u00a0 and\u00a0 sometimes of greater\u00a0 weight than that of the case\u00a0 of machinery mentioned, without any difficulty or mishap whatever, is\u00a0 that the mast and the spar and all of that apparatus for unloading, used in the removal of the said case from the steamer to the <i>lorcha,<\/i> had no defect whatever) was suitable for the purpose, and that there was no imprudence, carelessness, negligence, nor omission whatever on the part of\u00a0 Captain Watson in his having\u00a0 used\u00a0 on the said occasion\u00a0 the\u00a0 apparatus referred to, and that the damage resulting from the accident\u00a0 was caused by a merely fortuitous event,\u00a0 for which neither the captain of the vessel nor the other defendants can be held responsible.<br\/><br\/>\"Moreover, from the evidence adduced, it was also shown that, although the <i>lorcha Marte<\/i> had a tonnage of 67 tons, net weight, and could\u00a0 carry\u00a0 from 70 to\u00a0 75 tons, haying received, one or two days before the accident, a load of 67 tons of\u00a0 oil in barrels or jars,\u00a0 notwithstanding\u00a0 it was not designed to carry on deck in a fixed\u00a0 place - that is, in a single mass - a case like the\u00a0 one\u00a0 in\u00a0 question,\u00a0 of 25 tons weight whose dimensions were, approximately, 24 feet in length, 12 or\u00a0 14 feet in width, and\u00a0 8 feet in height, because the\u00a0 said lorcha had a round\u00a0 bottom and was of the type of boat used for\u00a0 receiving cargo in its\u00a0 hold, and not on\u00a0 its deck, which was not flat, but had hatches, which made it impossible or difficult to place the\u00a0 case on the deck; moreover, as the craft was not then carrying ballast, even though the case\u00a0 had been placed in the center of the deck, the lorcha would not\u00a0 have\u00a0 had the\u00a0 necessary stability to\u00a0 maintain itself in a\u00a0 horizontal position, it\u00a0 being due to this, and especially to the fact of\u00a0 its having a round bottom, that it inclined to one side in the manner aforestated when the case gravitated toward\u00a0 the prow on its starboard side until it became necessary for the <i>lorcha<\/i> to be made fast to the <i> Muncaster Castle<\/i>, as before related.<br\/><br\/>\"Now, then, the said lorcha was offered by the plaintiffs to Macondray\u00a0 &amp;\u00a0 Co., they,\u00a0 the plaintiffs,\u00a0 knowing, as indeed they must have known, the condition of the same, and knowing that it was intended to load therein the said 25-ton case, as shown by\u00a0 the letter,\u00a0 Exhibit 4, addressed on the 11th of April to the said Macondray &amp; Co. by the plaintiffs; so that the failure of that operation is partly due and must be attributed\u00a0 to the latter themselves,\u00a0 for the fact\u00a0 of the <i>lorcha<\/i> not being in suitable condition when it was placed\u00a0 at the disposal of the captain of the steamer alongside his vessel for the purpose of receiving the load contributed to the\u00a0 accident,\u00a0 since, as is\u00a0 easily understood from the explanations made by some of the defendants' witnesses, if the said craft had been sufficiently ballasted it, with the weight upon it, would not have listed so much toward the side where the case lay, and if it had had a flat deck and no hatches, it would\u00a0 have been easier to place\u00a0 the case on\u00a0 the\u00a0 deck than to have placed it in the hold.<br\/><br\/>\"Although the case had\u00a0 so great a weight as that of 25 tons and\u00a0 although\u00a0 it be admitted that, on\u00a0 the bending or leaning of the mast and the spar by the\u00a0 breaking of the pulleys, the case fell onto the deck with the full impulse of its weight a distance of from 18 inches to 2\u00a0 feet, the blow could not have been of such a nature as to have caused so much\u00a0 damage to the craft as was noted when\u00a0 it was placed in\u00a0 the shipyard for repairs.<br\/><br\/>\"It is understood, of course, that as an immediate result of such a blow the <i>lorcha<\/i> may have started to leak, and that, inclined on its starboard side, on account of the gravitation of the case\u00a0 in that direction, water must have entered its hold, but, as is deduced from the testimony of the captain of the steamer and from that of other witnesses of the defendants, the water could have been baled out so as to prevent the\u00a0 craft\u00a0 from submerging,\u00a0 and,\u00a0 with less\u00a0 indolence and inactivity on the part of the crew, the loss of the hatches and other parts of the upper works would have been avoided.<br\/><br\/>\"At all events,\u00a0 it was\u00a0 proved that the\u00a0 captain\u00a0 of\u00a0 the steamer adopted the necessary measures to secure the <i>lorcha<\/i> to the side of the vessel in such manner as to prevent its total loss\u00a0 and to enable the case to be removed from it, by means of a floating derrick, and brought\u00a0 ashore by the Manila Electric Railroad\u00a0 and Light\u00a0 Company, the\u00a0 <i>lorcha<\/i> from that moment, being freed from the weight which was bearing down upon it, it was possible to remove\u00a0 the boat from its place alongside the ship and take it to the shipyard for repairs.<br\/><br\/>\"This, however, was not done until four days afterwards, that\u00a0 is, on the 19th, the lorcha having been\u00a0 during all\u00a0 that time attached to\u00a0 the\u00a0 steamer by cables and\u00a0 almost\u00a0 submerged, which,\u00a0 together\u00a0 with the\u00a0 blows it must have received from the vessel itself, on account of the movement of the waves, necessarily produced, in its upper works and also within, much damage that would not have been caused if the <i>lorcha<\/i> had been removed from that place and taken to the shipyard the day following the accident.<br\/><br\/>\"As neither the captain of the steamer nor Macondray &amp; Co. were responsible for the said removal and conveyance, as aforesaid, it devolved upon the plaintiffs to perform those operations which in fact they did five days afterwards, and therefore the latter themselves must suffer the consequences of their lack of diligence, and because the <i>lorcha<\/i> was not released from the said situation as soon as the case\u00a0 was extracted, which prevented the release of the craft, the latter received greater damage than was the immediate and direct result of the fall of the heavy case upon it.<br\/><br\/>\"Lastly, it was not proved that the captain of the <i>Muncaster Castle<\/i> failed to render the required aid in order to keep the <i>lorcha<\/i>\u00a0 in such\u00a0 condition that the plaintiffs could remove it from its position at the side of the steamer and convey it to the shipyard, and it is unlikely, and can not be deemed as proved, that he prevented the <i>lorcha'<\/i>s crew from picking up\u00a0 the\u00a0 hatches and\u00a0 other\u00a0 appurtenances of the injured craft which were floating about on the sea, or from executing any other act for the salvage of the said <i>lorcha,<\/i> and\u00a0 it is much less probable that the first officer of the said steamer compelled the said crew to throw the hatches overboard, as stated by the master of the <i>lorcha,<\/i> Zacarias Labrador, in his testimony given at the trial, the\u00a0 testimony of Hilario Tan Toco, the man in charge or representative on the lorcha of Rocha &amp; Co., being more likely and credible, to the effect that he ordered the crew to gather up the hatches and that then one of the officers of the <i>Muncaster Castle<\/i> also ordered his crew to gather them up, a part of them being placed on the <i>lorcha<\/i> and\u00a0 a part on the steamer; and it was also\u00a0 shown, by the testimony of Tomas Felipe, the customs inspector who was present at the time on the <i>Muncaster Castle,<\/i> that the crew of the lorcha did nothing toward gathering up the hatches; from all of which it must be concluded that it was necessary for Hilario Tan Toco,\u00a0 Rocha &amp; Co\/s man in charge, to order the <i>lorcha<\/i>'s crew to gather up the hatches in order to have them do so, and this is sufficient to conclude that the said\u00a0 crew did nothing by themselves, and were not disposed to do\u00a0 anything\u00a0 on their\u00a0 own initiative for the salvage of the craft and to avoid greater\u00a0 damage being done thereto during the period of time that elapsed from the moment the accident occurred on\u00a0 the\u00a0 afternoon of the 14th until the morning of the 19th, when the plaintiffs proceeded to salve the said craft and convey it to a shipyard in this city; and it is unquestionable that, during those five days, the\u00a0 said plaintiffs\u00a0 could have done a good\u00a0 deal\u00a0 to prevent an increase\u00a0 of the losses and damages suffered by the <i>lorcha<\/i>, without the necessity of\u00a0 orders being given\u00a0 for that purpose by the captain\u00a0 and officers of the <i>Muncaster Castle,<\/i> and they also could have gathered up the said hatches, if it were true that they had been\u00a0 put on a lighter or in the bow of the steamer by order of the first officer, as\u00a0 the master of the\u00a0 <i>lorcha<\/i> testified.<br\/><br\/>\"In conclusion, the testimony of\u00a0 the\u00a0 said master and of Arturo\u00a0 Blanco,\u00a0 the inspector of vessels, introduced in\u00a0 rebuttal by the plaintiffs to prove\u00a0 that the stevedore, Farris, was not on board the <i>Muncaster Castle<\/i> when the accident occurred,\u00a0 but arrived some moments\u00a0 afterwards,\u00a0 is not worthy of belief, because, besides\u00a0 the fact of these two witnesses being employees of the plaintiffs themselves, their testimony is contradictory to that given by the captain\u00a0 of the steamer, H. P. Winkler,\u00a0 a witness for the defendants, who mentioned Mr. Farris as one of those who was present at the time on the said steamer, and the testimony of Farris himself, considered in connection with the statements made by the other witnesses who were present during the accident, prove that he also was present.\u00a0 It is, moreover, strange, and can not but attract our attention, that Arturo\u00a0 Blanco, being aboard the Muncaster Castle that afternoon, according to his own testimony, when Farris,\u00a0 as he testified,\u00a0 arrived in a launch from Canacao, and Zacarias Labrador being at that same time, according to his own testimony, not on the steamer,\u00a0 but on the sea, these two,\u00a0 Farris and\u00a0 Labrador, should have testified that Farris arrived ten minutes after the accident - a uniformity\u00a0 of statements which makes the testimony of both of these witnesses suspicious, and so much the more that, in\u00a0 order to\u00a0 prove that point,\u00a0 the plaintiffs could have availed themselves of the testimony\u00a0 of\u00a0 Tomas Felipe himself, one of their witnesses, and that of the other persons who were aboard the steamer on that occasion.<br\/><br\/>\"By virtue of the foregoing reasons,\u00a0 the court sabsolves the defendants, with the costs against\u00a0 the plaintiffs.\u00a0 So ordered.\u00a0 Manila,\u00a0 August 30,\u00a0 1909. -\u00a0 (Sgd.)

PHELPS (ALIAS PHILLIPS), DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/>\n<br\/>\nD E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TRENT, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">The defendant, James O. Phelps, was charged in the Court of First Instance of Jolo, Moro Province, with having violated the provisions of Act No. 1761. He was tried, found guilty as charged, and sentenced to one month's imprisonment and to pay a fine of P250, Philippine currency, and in case of insolvency to suffer the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment at the rate of P2.50 a day, and to pay the costs.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He appealed.<br\/><br\/>The prosecution presented but one witness in this case, Homer G. Smith, an employee of the Bureau of Internal Revenue. This witness testified that the first time he ever saw the accused was in the International Saloon in Jolo in the month of April, 1909; that at that time, while two or three men were sitting together in the said saloon, he heard the accused say that he on some occasions liked to smoke opium; that a few hours after leaving the saloon he asked the accused if he smoked opium, and the accused answered \"yes,\" that he smoked sometimes; that he knew then that it was his duty to watch the accused; that he then asked the accused what opportunities he had for smoking opium, and the accused replied, \"good opportunities;\" that he then said to the accused, \"I wish to smoke opium.\" On the invitation of the accused he looked him up that night and was told that he (the accused) was not able to prepare a room for smoking, as the Chinamen were afraid, and asked the witness to see him the following night; that he saw him the following night, and accused again said that he could not find a suitable place; that they made another agreement to meet and at that time they went together to a certain house in the barrio of Tulay, where a certain Chinaman (this Chinaman was charged in criminal case No. 292 in said court) had prepared the opium and pipe for smoking; that the accused gave the Chinaman P2, and he (the witness) gave him P1 in payment for the preparation of the pipe and opium; that the accused smoked in the house of this Chinaman two pills of opium, and that one was prepared for him (the witness) to smoke, and on receiving the pipe which was prepared for smoking he took the pipe and the pan containing the opium and went directly to the justice of the peace and swore out a warrant for the arrest of the accused and the said Chinaman.<br\/><br\/>The defendant, J. 0. Phelps, a man 30 years of age, testified that Smith, who was then going under the name of Lockwood, came to his house one night in Jolo and said that he was accustomed to smoking opium and asked him (the accused) if he knew of any Chinaman in the town who could assist him in obtaining opium to smoke; that he answered Smith that he did not; that Smith then asked him if the Chinaman (the one charged in criminal case No. 292), who was the accused's servant, could look for someone to furnish him (Smith) with a pipe until he became acquainted in town; that on the following night the witness Smith came again to his house, and after being there about twenty minutes became very nervous, saying that it was necessary for him to have some opium; that he told him (Smith) to go to the hospital, and received the reply that he (Smith) was working for the quartermaster and was looking for a position as clerk, and that they probably would not give him this position if they learned that he was an opium smoker; that he again asked to have the Chinaman assist him, and he (the accused) believing that he (Smith) was acting in good faith and was really sick, told the Chinaman to do so; that by agreement he and the witness Smith went to the house of the Chinaman in Tulay, where the Chinaman' prepared the pipe and gave it to Smith, he (Smith) giving the Chinaman P2, and that he (Smith) then left, without the accused noticing whether he smoked or not, and that he (the accused) was arrested about forty minutes later, and that he called for the doctor to examine him about one and one-half hours after he left the Chinaman's house.<br\/><br\/>The Chinaman corroborated the testimony of the accused on every material point, stating that he, after repeated demands made by Smith, did prepare some opium in a pipe and give it to Smith.<br\/><br\/>The chief of police of Job, a sergeant in the United States Cavalry, who arrested the accused and the Chinaman, testified that when he made these arrests the Chinaman and the accused did not have an opportunity to talk together before they went to the justice of the peace where the preliminary investigation was held.<br\/><br\/>Doctor De Krafft, of the United States Army, was called by the accused himself and made an examination of the accused about an hour and a half or two hours after he left the Chinaman's house. The doctor testified that the accused was a strong, robust man, and a man presenting no appearance of an opium smoker. On being asked by the court whether or not he could state positively if the accused had used any opium on that day, the witness answered, \"I am sure that he did not use any opium on that day.\"<br\/><br\/>The court below in its decision said:<br\/><blockquote>\"I agree with him (the doctor) that the accused does not appear to be a person who uses daily a large amount of opium. The accused is a strong, robust man, in good physical condition, and from a casual examination of his person no one would accuse him of being a habitual user of opium.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The prosecution does not contend that the appellant sold or had in his possession any opium, neither does it contend that he had in his possession any of the prohibited paraphernalia used in smoking this drug. He is only charged with having smoked opium this one time in the house of the Chinaman, and the prosecution rests its case solely upon the testimony of the witness Smith, who was an employee of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, secretly acting in that capacity in Jolo.<br\/><br\/>On arriving in Jolo, Smith obtained employment in order to hide his true mission. He assumed the name of Lockwood for the same purpose, engaged in gambling, and admits having visited the house of the appellant three times for the purpose of making arrangements for himself and the. accused to smoke opium. He stated to the accused that he (Smith) was desirous of smoking. He urged the accused to have the Chinaman make arrangements so they both could smoke. He went to the house of the Chinaman with the accused and paid the said Chinaman, according to his own statement, P1 for the preparation of the opium. If he had, by these means, induced the appellant to sell opium or to exhibit in his possession either opium or any of the prohibited paraphernalia, his testimony would be more reasonable, since the mere possession of the drug or any of the prohibited paraphernalia is a violation of the law within itself.<br\/><br\/>But, as we have said, it is not contended that the accused had in his possession any of these things. According to the statements made by the witness Smith, he not only suggested the commission of this crime, but he (Smith) also stated that he desired to commit the same offense and would pay his part of the expense necessary for the commission of the prohibited act. Such conduct on the part of a m&amp;n who is employed by the Government for the purpose of taking such steps as are necessary to prevent the commission of the offense and which would tend to the elevation and improvement of the defendant, as a would be criminal, rather than further his debasement, should be rebuked rather than encouraged by the courts; and when such acts as those committed by the witness Smith are placed beside the positive testimony of the defendant, corroborated by the Chinaman and the doctor, the testimony of such witness sinks into insignificance and certainly does not deserve credit. When an employee of the Government, as in this case, and according to his own testimony, encourages or induces persons to commit a crime in order to prosecute them, such conduct is most reprehensible. We desire to be understood that we base our conclusions as to the conduct of the witness Smith and the incredibility of his testimony on his own acts according to his own testimony.<br\/><br\/>We are, therefore, of the opinion and so hold, that the appellant is not guilty of this crime. The judgment of the lower court is reversed and the appellant acquitted, with costs <i>de oficio<\/i>.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

The complaint further alleged that the defendant paid the rental up to 1905, since which date he discontinued to do so; that the latter, in the years 1906, 1907, and 1908, harvested 6 <i>uyones <\/i>of unhulled rice and 6 bales of tobacco, and that the value of\u00a0 plaintiff's\u00a0 one-half share of these products was P60;\u00a0 and\u00a0 concluded by\u00a0 asking\u00a0 that the\u00a0 defendant restore the land to the plaintiff and deliver to him 3 <i>uyones<\/i> of unhulled rice\u00a0 and 3 bales of tobacco, or pay him P60, and that the costs be assessed against the\u00a0 defendant.<br\/><br\/>The defendant admitted that\u00a0 he owned\u00a0 a piece of land in the place mentioned, but that it\u00a0 was not of the same area and boundaries\u00a0 as those\u00a0 stated by the plaintiff, but had the boundaries and area which he in turn\u00a0 specified. The defendant claimed that the said land was his and had been\u00a0 in\u00a0 his\u00a0 possession\u00a0 for\u00a0 the past thirty years.\u00a0\u00a0 Subsequently, however, the parties came to an agreement with respect to the identity of the land.<br\/><br\/>After the production of both oral\u00a0 and documentary evidence, the Court of First Instance\u00a0 of Ilocos\u00a0 Sur decided the suit by absolving the defendant, without\u00a0 special finding as to costs.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiffs appealed, with right to a\u00a0 review\u00a0 of the evidence;\u00a0 and\u00a0 we find the following facts to have been proved:<br\/><ol type=\"1\"><li>The\u00a0 origin of the title to the land in question. - The defendant\u00a0 himself states that the original owner\u00a0 of the property\u00a0 was\u00a0 Rafael\u00a0 Castillo, who\u00a0 died\u00a0 without leaving either descendants or ascendants, and that\u00a0 on\u00a0 this account his brother, Manuel Castillo, was the\u00a0 sole heir.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>The\u00a0 conveyance of\u00a0 the\u00a0 land at the\u00a0 death of Manuel Castillo. - Three witnesses testified with respect thereto - Venancia\u00a0 Castillo, Alejo\u00a0 Castillo, and Vicenta Castillo.<\/li><\/ol>Venancia Castillo is the daughter of\u00a0 Manuel Castillo, and was\u00a0 married in second\u00a0 wedlock to\u00a0 Pascual Castillo. Pascual Castillo, as\u00a0 appears\u00a0 from the record,\u00a0 by his first wife had\u00a0 two\u00a0 children, the defendant, Ambrosio Castilla, and Vicenta Castillo, previously referred to.\u00a0 The plaintiff, Eustaquia\u00a0 Castillo, was born\u00a0 of his second marriage with Venancia\u00a0 Castillo.\u00a0 So that\u00a0 Eustaquia,\u00a0 the plaintiff,\u00a0 and Ambrosio, the\u00a0 defendant, are children of the same father, Pascual, although of different mothers.<br\/><br\/>Although Manuel Castillo had other children besides Venancia, namely, Adriano, Martin, Agapita, and\u00a0 Luis,\u00a0 yet, in the partition of his property, the land in question, inherited by him from Rafael, as aforesaid, fell to Venancia's share. This was testified to by Alejo Castillo,\u00a0 before mentioned, one of the sharers in that partition, in representation of his mother, Agapita, and the said Vicenta Castillo, a sister by the same father\u00a0 and mother\u00a0 of the\u00a0 defendant Ambrosio.\u00a0 No reason has\u00a0 been advanced for doubting their\u00a0 testimony, and still less\u00a0 has any\u00a0 proof been submitted whereby that testimony could be rejected.<br\/><ol start=\"3\"><li>The possession of the title of ownership. - The title of ownership to the land, originally obtained by Rafael Castillo, was held by Venancia Castillo, after the death of her father Manuel, and it was Venancia's daughter, the plaintiff Eustaquia Castillo, who\u00a0 presented it at the trial as proof of her right of dominion.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>The conveyance of Venancia's property to her daughter Eustaquia. - This is proved by the same three witnesses, Venancia, Alejo, and\u00a0 Vicenta Castillo, and\u00a0 also by Victoriano\u00a0 Castro.\u00a0 When the latter married Eustaquia Castillo, his wife received from her mother Venancia the said land as a gift <i>propter nuptias. <\/i><br\/><br\/><\/li><li>The character of the land at the\u00a0 time that Venancia married Pascual\u00a0 Castillo. - This\u00a0 was\u00a0 stated explicitly in the testimony of Vicenta Castillo, the\u00a0 sister, by the same father and\u00a0 mother, of the defendant Ambrosio\u00a0 Castillo. This witness testified that her mother had brought that property on\u00a0 her marriage with Pascual Castillo; so that it belonged to\u00a0 the\u00a0 private or paraphernal property of the wife,\u00a0 in which her husband, Pascual Castillo,\u00a0 could have no share, and\u00a0 this fact was positively\u00a0 affirmed\u00a0 in\u00a0 her testimony by the daughter of Pascual Castillo.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>The possession of the land since the\u00a0 death of Manuel Castillo. - This was established by the same three witnesses, particularly by one of them, Alejo Castillo, who, moreover, testified\u00a0 that for about five years the\u00a0 property had been mortgaged to him by his aunt, Venancia, until she canceled the mortgage when she\u00a0 intended giving\u00a0 the land to\u00a0 her daughter Eustaquia at the time the latter contracted marriage with Victoriano Castro.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>The reason why the\u00a0 land was in the possession of the defendant. - This was stated\u00a0 by the same witnesses, and also by Victoriano Castro, who\u00a0 was not\u00a0 even\u00a0 cross-questioned by the\u00a0 opposing\u00a0 party.\u00a0 They\u00a0 uniformly\u00a0 testified that, at the very beginning of the marriage of Victoriano Castro with Eustaquia Castillo, the former leased the land to Ambrosio Castillo, at a certain annual rental, and that this\u00a0 lessee continued paying the rental, except during the last\u00a0 three years.\u00a0 Thus it\u00a0 was that the' lessor sued the lessee for\u00a0 the payment\u00a0 of\u00a0 the said unpaid\u00a0 rent, as confirmed by a certified copy of the defendant's answer to the complaint, presented\u00a0 for the purpose,\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiff's\u00a0 Exhibit C,\u00a0 corroborated\u00a0 by the defendant in the\u00a0 following terms:<br\/><\/li><\/ol><blockquote>\"Q. Do you remember whether there was ever any litigation\u00a0 between the same parties, over this same land\u00a0 today in dispute? - A.\u00a0 Yes, sir; before this suit for the recovery of possession was started, this same woman Eustaquia sued me for the rental of the land in question, and therefore the land which is the subject of the present litigation\u00a0 is the same as\u00a0 that concerned\u00a0 in the previous suit,\u00a0 with the exception of a few differences which were settled in an agreement between the parties made the other day at the hearing of this case.\"<\/blockquote>In the\u00a0 said answer the defendant said:<br\/><blockquote>\"3. That he is the owner of the land concerned in\u00a0 this case, and as such owner he has been in the possession and enjoyment\u00a0 of the same, without any interruption on the part of anyone, since February, 1884, when it was\u00a0 given to\u00a0 him <i>propter nuptias.<\/i>\"<\/blockquote>But in\u00a0 the present\u00a0 suit the defendant\u00a0 endeavored to prove his ownership by the following witnesses:<br\/><br\/>Silvestre Castillo, who testified that the disputed land belonged to the defendant \"because he had inherited it from his first\u00a0 wife, Procesa Castillo,\u00a0 who also had inherited it from her father, Adriano Castillo.\"<br\/><br\/>Angel\u00a0 Castillo, a brother of the defendant,\u00a0 who testified that the\u00a0 said land\u00a0 belonged\u00a0 to the latter \"because\u00a0 it\u00a0 was conveyed to the defendant by Manuel Castillo, our father's cousin,\u00a0 in consideration of the defendant's\u00a0 having contributed\u00a0 toward\u00a0 the\u00a0 payment of\u00a0 a debt which\u00a0 the said Manuel had contracted\u00a0 with\u00a0 a\u00a0 <i>mestizo <\/i>of\u00a0 Vigan and on\u00a0 account of which this same land, together with some other parcels of land, had been mortgaged.\"<br\/><br\/>And Tomasa Secretario, the second wife of the defendant, who testified as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Q. Do you know the\u00a0 land in question? - A. Yes, sir; I know it because it\u00a0 was given to us\u00a0 at\u00a0 the\u00a0 time of our marriage, for the defendant is my husband.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Do you know this document,\u00a0 Exhibit A of the defendant? - A.\u00a0 That is the document which they\u00a0 gave us in support of\u00a0 the gifts received when I was married, and they told me\u00a0 that it contained the\u00a0 land\u00a0 in question, but I do not know how to read.\"<\/blockquote>This Exhibit A, which the defendant presented as proof of his ownership, is written in the\u00a0 local vernacular and its translation, which was admitted at the trial, reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"By these presents is\u00a0 made\u00a0 to appear\u00a0 that which\u00a0 I am able to give to my son Ambrosio Castillo on his marriage with Tomasa Secretario, and which is as follows:<br\/><br\/>\"1. A parcel of rice land in the sitio named Bugnay, etc.<br\/>\"2. A parcel of rice land in the sitio of Balay-oac, etc.<br\/>\"3. A parcel of rice land in the sitio called Binulalaan,<br\/>\"4. A parcel of vegetable garden land, etc.<br\/>\"5. Three carabaos, etc,<br\/>\"6. One cow calf, etc.<br\/>\"7. Two horses, etc.<br\/>\"8. One peso, in cash.\"<\/blockquote>This document was signed on the 23d of February,\u00a0 1884, by\u00a0 Pascual\u00a0 Castillo; and by others\u00a0 of the Castillo family with a cross, because they did not know how to write their names.<br\/><br\/>No land whatever situated in\u00a0 Cabulalaan (formerly Bato) which is, according to the litigating parties, the subject of the dispute, appears to have been given.<br\/><br\/>And although the land in question had been given in a clear and precise manner, such a gift would not constitute a title in favor of\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant, for the simple reason that, as the land had been\u00a0 brought by Venancia Castillo to her marriage with Pascual Castillo, the husband could not dispose of a thing which was the private and\u00a0 exclusive property of his wife and which was acquired prior to the marriage.<br\/><br\/>The three assignments of error alleged in this appeal by the appellants are admissible.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is reversed, without special finding as to costs, and the\u00a0 trial\u00a0 court shall render\u00a0 judgment in strict accordance with the petition of the complaint. So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Johnson, Moreland<\/i>, and <i>Trent, JJ.,<\/i> concur.<br\/><\/div>",

The defendant in his counterclaim asks the court to direct the plaintiff to return to him the said camarin and lot and the rent therefor from the 1st of September, 1907, being the date of the termination of the eight-year lease.<br\/><br\/>After the termination of the trial the court rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff directing the defendant to execute in favor of the plaintiff the proper document for the transfer and sale of that part of the lot, including the <i>camarin<\/i>, which was not resold to the defendant. The defendant having been notified of this decision, made a motion for a new trial upon the ground that the findings of fact made by the court below are plainly and manifestly against the weight of the evidence, which motion was denied by the trial court.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He appealed.<br\/><br\/>The sale of the lot and <i>camarin<\/i> in question was not evidenced by any documents, either private or public. The only proof presented is the oral testimony of the witnesses for both parties. The court below stated that, after a careful examination of the evidence, it was of the opinion that it had been satisfactorily established that the defendant did, in fact, sell to the plaintiff in the year 1899 or 1900 the property described in the complaint for the sum of 1,050 pesos, and directed the defendant to execute in favor of the plaintiff the corresponding document of purchase and\u00a0 sale for that part of the lot,\u00a0 including the camarin, which was not resold to the defendant.<br\/><br\/>After a careful examination of the proofs presented in this case we are of the opinion that the findings of fact of the trial court are fully sustained by the record inasmuch as it has been established that the plaintiff did by means of a verbal contract in 1899 or 1900 purchase from the defendant the lot camarin in question and turned over to the defendant the sum of 1,050 pesos in cash, which the defendant received to his entire satisfaction. This was a consummated verbal sale of real estate. Nothing was left for the parties to do except the obligation on the part of the defendant to express this consummated contract in writing. So the only contract of sale in this case was a verbal one. The defendant insists that in order for a sale, transferring any right, title or interest in real estate, to be valid it must be evidenced by a public document and in support of this theory cites article 1280 of the Civil Code. This is not the first time this question has been before this court. In the case of Soriano vs. Cortes, 8 Phil. Rep., 459, the court said\u00a0 (p. 460):<br\/><br\/>\"The provisions of that article (1280) were discussed by this court in the case of Thunga Chui<i> vs<\/i>. Que Bentec (2 Phil. Rep., 561), and it was there held that a contract required by said article 1280 to be in writing was, nevertheless, valid and produced legal effects between the parties, although it was made verbally. It was there considered that this effect was given to such oral contracts by article 1278, and although it might be necessary for the party seeking to enforce such verbal contract to take some action under article 1279 to secure the execution of the proper documents, yet this requirement did not render the contract invalid.\" (Citing Fortis <i>vs.<\/i> Gutierrez Hermanos, 6 Phil. Rep., 100; Irureta <i>vs<\/i>. Tambunting, 1 Phil. Rep., 490.)<br\/><br\/>The consummated verbal contract in the case at bar is valid among the parties themselves according to the above rule laid down by this court.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the lower court is, therefore, affirmed, with costs against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Arellano, C.

IN LIQUIDATION, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.\n<br\/>\n<br\/>\nD E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>JOHNSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">An\u00a0 action by the plaintiffs to\u00a0 recover of the defendant the sum of P17,325.42, with interest at the rate of 5 per cent from the 1st of January, 1907, and costs.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff, Francisca Palet y de Yebra, and Agustin Palet y Roca\u00a0 (the latter now\u00a0 deceased) were legally married, and as a result of said marriage there were born to them Rosa, Montserrate,\u00a0 Agustin and Dominga Palet y Palet.\u00a0 Agustin Palet y Roca died at Barcelona in Spain on the 15th of March,\u00a0 1900.<br\/><br\/>Agustin Palet y Roca had been a member\u00a0 of\u00a0 the defendant company from the 31st of December, 1896.\u00a0\u00a0 After the death\u00a0 of Agustin Palet y Roca a liquidation was\u00a0 had of his interests in the defendant company, in accordance with the provisions of the copartnership agreement, dated the 31st of December,\u00a0 1896,\u00a0 As a result of this\u00a0 liquidation and in accordance with a public document (No. 364) dated the 8th of May,\u00a0 1900, there was found\u00a0 to be due\u00a0 to the estate\u00a0 of\u00a0 Agustin Palet y Roca from the said defendant company the sum of P115,502.56, which sum the defendant company promised to pay to the heirs of Agustin Palet y Roca,\u00a0 in\u00a0 seven\u00a0 annual installments,\u00a0 in\u00a0 accordance with paragraph 5 of the said liquidation, which paragraph 5\u00a0 is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Fifth.\u00a0 Messrs. Aldecoa &amp; Co.,\u00a0 and Mr. Sixto Jesus Alvarez Perez on their\u00a0 behalf, declare that the capital paid into the partnership by Mr. Agustin Palet y Roca, deceased, on January 1, of the\u00a0 present year, amounts to the sum of P100,000, to which the corresponding amount of the reserve fund, belonging to him, and amounting to P15,502.56, must be added.\u00a0 They bind themselves\u00a0 to pay\u00a0 the said sums to the heirs of Palet\u00a0 in yearly installments\u00a0 at\u00a0 the rate of P16,500.36 each,\u00a0 except\u00a0 the last, which will amount to P16,500.40, plus interest at\u00a0 the rate of 5 per cent per annum, from March 16,\u00a0 of the present year; the\u00a0 first installment to be paid on December 31 of the current year, and the other payments on the same date in the years following, and they declare that, according to the agreements entered into in the contract of partnership, the said obligation has a preference over any other obligation which the\u00a0 partnership might assume during the term of its existence, taking into account, for such purpose, the nature and character thereof.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The\u00a0 defendant company, in accordance with said\u00a0 agreement, made the first\u00a0 payment on the 31st of December, 1900, and each of the successive payments or installments up to the one which fell due on the 31st of December, 1906. The installments' or payments which had been made\u00a0 by the defendant company prior\u00a0 to the 31st of December, 1906, had been made to Fernandez Hermanos, as the representative of Francisca Palet y Yebra and her said minor children. The demand for the payment which was due\u00a0 on\u00a0 the 31st of December,\u00a0 1906, was\u00a0 made by one Joaquin Mustaroz, who represented himself as the\u00a0 \"<i>apoderado de Da. Francisca Palet y Yebra de Oliver<\/i>.\"\u00a0\u00a0 By the power of attorney which the said Joaquin Mustaroz presented, showing his authority\u00a0 to collect the said payment\u00a0 or installment, the defendant discovered that the said plaintiff, Francisca Palet y de\" Yebra had contracted a second marriage with\u00a0 Jose Oliver y\u00a0 Bauza.\u00a0 The defendant\u00a0 company refused to pay the said agent\u00a0 the said installment (the one due December 31, 1906)\u00a0 upon the ground that he had no\u00a0 authority or right to collect the said sum as the agent of Francisca Palet y Yebra de Oliver, in the name of the heirs of Agustin Palet y Roca.<br\/><br\/>The second marriage of Francisca Palet y de Yebra with Jose Oliver y Bauza is fully admitted\u00a0 and proved.\u00a0\u00a0 (See Exhibit A.)<br\/><br\/>The theory of the defendant upon which it denied the payment of the said sum\u00a0 to the\u00a0 said agent of Francisca Palet y de Yebra is based upon the provisions of the Civil Code, which deprive the mother of her natural guardianship of the minor children by virtue of a second marriage.\u00a0 The defendant\u00a0 does not deny\u00a0 its obligation to the heirs of Agustin Palet y Roca under the contract of liquidation of the 8th of May, 1900.\u00a0\u00a0 It\u00a0 simply denies that the parties demanding payment now have authority to collect the same. The only reply which the plaintiffs and appellees\u00a0 make to this argument of the defendant is that the defendant had already paid the other installments to the plaintiffs.<br\/><br\/>Article\u00a0 159 of the Civil Code provides that \"the father, or, in his absence, the mother, <i>is the legal administrator of the estate of the children who are under their authority.\"<\/i><br\/><br\/>Article\u00a0 168\u00a0 of the same\u00a0 code\u00a0 provides that \"a mother who contracts a second marriage loses her <i>parental authority<\/i> over her children unless the deceased husband\u2014the father of the latter - shall have in his\u00a0 will made express provision\u00a0 for the\u00a0 remarriage of his widow, and\u00a0 ordered that in such case she .was to preserve and exercise parental authority over their children.\"<br\/><br\/>Together with these provisions of the Civil Code, others of the Code of Civil Procedure\u00a0 are also in force, section 553 of which prescribes that - <br\/><blockquote><i>\"Father or mother natural guardian and\u00a0 to be appointed guardian\u00a0 of the estate, if competent.<\/i> - The father, or, in case of his death or legal disqualification,\u00a0 the\u00a0 mother, of a minor child,\u00a0 is to be deemed the natural guardian of the child, and as such is entitled\u00a0 to\u00a0 the custody, and care for the education,\u00a0 of the minor, but not of his estate, unless so ordered by the court.\u00a0\u00a0 It shall be the duty of the judge, in the appointment of a guardian of the estate\u00a0 of a minor child, to appoint the father or mother or near\u00a0 relative of the child, preference being given in the order just named; but the court shall have the power to\u00a0 set aside the\u00a0 order of preference here provided,\u00a0 and to appoint any\u00a0 suitable person as guardian, either of the person or of the estate of the minor, or both, as the best interests of the child may require.\u00a0\u00a0 The authority\u00a0 of the guardian shall\u00a0 not be extinguished or affected by the marriage of the guardian.\"<\/blockquote>Under the Civil Code in force\u00a0 in these Islands, which is the same as the present code in Spain, Francisca Palet lost the right\u00a0 of guardianship over her children because of her second marriage, unless\u00a0 it be\u00a0 shown\u00a0 that her\u00a0 deceased husband, father of the children,\u00a0 stipulated in his will that his widow, although she married again, should\u00a0 retain\u00a0 and exercise such guardianship over the children by the first marriage; as the existence of such condition is\u00a0 not shown, as prescribed by article 168, it is clear that Francisca Palet, widow of\u00a0 Agustin Palet and\u00a0 mother\u00a0 of the\u00a0 said minor children, has at present no right to represent them as\u00a0 guardian,\u00a0 and\u00a0 therefore she\u00a0 has\u00a0 no\u00a0 authority to\u00a0 collect\u00a0 any money corresponding to the estate of the children.<br\/><br\/>Even supposing that the provisions of the section of the Code\u00a0 of Civil Procedure\u00a0 above quoted\u00a0 were applicable in her favor, it would still be necessary that she be appointed tutor\u00a0 by a competent judge; in the absence of such appointment\u00a0 she\u00a0 could not be considered as the\u00a0 natural guardian of the said children with the right to represent them personally and judicially\u00a0 before the courts.<br\/><br\/>It might be argued that the\u00a0 plaintiff,\u00a0 Prancisca Palet y de\u00a0 Yebra,\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 present\u00a0 action might be\u00a0 permitted to collect that portion of the\u00a0 said indebtedness\u00a0 to which she is entitled,\u00a0 inasmuch as she sues\u00a0 for herself and in representation of her minor children.\u00a0\u00a0 There is nothing in the record which shows to what portion of said indebtedness she is entitled.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff,\u00a0 Francisca\u00a0 Palet\u00a0 y de Yebra, having\u00a0 lost her power to administer the\u00a0 estate of her minor children, was without authority, conjointly with her\u00a0 second husband, Jose Oliver y\u00a0 Bauza,\u00a0 to confer upon Joaquin Mustaroz y Portell power to administer such estate or to collect moneys due the\u00a0 estate of\u00a0 such minor\u00a0 children, or\u00a0 to\u00a0 collect\u00a0 the same\u00a0 herself,\u00a0 unless she had been duly appointed by\u00a0 the court.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the lower\u00a0 court is,\u00a0 therefore, hereby reversed, without prejudice to the right of Francisca Palet y de Yebra, if she\u00a0 is entitled to any portion of\u00a0 said claim, and\u00a0 the\u00a0 proper legal representative of\u00a0 the said\u00a0 minor children, to commence another action against the defendant for\u00a0 the\u00a0 purpose of collecting\u00a0 the said\u00a0 installments, and without any findings as to costs, it is so ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

It was sold for\u00a0 and on behalf of the defendant by a Chinese broker to a Chinese\u00a0 lumber merchant and money lender named Rafael Cotauco, for P590, who upon the maturity of defendant's\u00a0 acceptance, presented\u00a0 it to the defendant for\u00a0 payment,\u00a0 and was informed\u00a0 that defendant had no funds, and had made\u00a0 a general assignment in favor of his creditors, some\u00a0 of whom had forced him\u00a0 into liquidation a\u00a0 few\u00a0 days before the acceptance fell due.<br\/><br\/>The facts just set\u00a0 out, which\u00a0 in our\u00a0 opinion are fully established by the evidence of record, if unexplained, would leave little room for doubt that the defendant prepared a fictitious commercial\u00a0 instrument for\u00a0 the\u00a0 purpose\u00a0 of\u00a0 deceiving the purchaser to whom\u00a0 he sold\u00a0 it, by giving\u00a0 the instrument the appearance of a draft or bill\u00a0 of exchange drawn\u00a0 in the regular course of business,\u00a0 with a drawer, payee,\u00a0 and indorsers upon whom the purchaser might rely tor payment in the event of the failure of the defendant acceptor so to do; and that the purchaser,\u00a0 deceived by the fictitious quality\u00a0 given the\u00a0 instrument as a\u00a0 commercial document, had suffered by the deception\u00a0 of the defendant to the amount which he paid therefor.<br\/><br\/>But we think that there are\u00a0 further facts disclosed by the evidence of record which are sufficient\u00a0 to raise a reasonable\u00a0 doubt not only as to the intent of the defendant to deceive the\u00a0 purchaser of the instrument, but also as to whether the purchaser was in fact deceived,\u00a0 to his loss or detriment, by\u00a0 the peculiar and unusual form in which the instrument was executed.\u00a0 We\u00a0 can not close our\u00a0 eyes to the fact that a most reprehensible practice (we\u00a0 refuse to dignify it by\u00a0 speaking of it as a custom)\u00a0 exists among many\u00a0 of the\u00a0 Chinese merchants of the city of\u00a0 Manila, whereby borrowers,\u00a0 with the full knowledge\u00a0 of the lender, execute just such instruments as the one under consideration, in evidence of loans and advances such as that made by the\u00a0 purchaser\u00a0 of the\u00a0 instrument in\u00a0 the case\u00a0 at bar. What may be\u00a0 the origin of this practice,\u00a0 or what\u00a0 are the objects of the Chinese merchants who adopt it, we do not undertake at this\u00a0 time to determine.\u00a0\u00a0 It is sufficient for the purposes of this decision to say that the existence of the practice is a matter of general knowledge in\u00a0 this\u00a0 community, and is disclosed\u00a0 by the records\u00a0 of\u00a0 various cases brought to this court, one\u00a0 of\u00a0 which, a civil case, is actually pending at this time; and\u00a0 that while the\u00a0 defendant in the case\u00a0 at bar did\u00a0 not expressly\u00a0 set up or rely\u00a0 upon the existence of the practice\u00a0 in\u00a0 his defense,\u00a0 we\u00a0 are satisfied that\u00a0 the evidence\u00a0 of record raises at\u00a0 least a reasonable doubt\u00a0 as to whether the\u00a0 transaction in question was not had in accordance with this\u00a0 practice with the full knowledge\u00a0 and\u00a0 consent of the\u00a0 complaining witness,\u00a0 the\u00a0 purchaser of the\u00a0 alleged fictitious and fraudulent instrument.<br\/><br\/>From the evidence of one\u00a0 of the principal witnesses for the prosecution, it appears that\u00a0 defendant not infrequently prepared and\u00a0 had discounted just such instruments as the one now under consideration,\u00a0 and that\u00a0 on at\u00a0 least one occasion this\u00a0 witness himself discounted such an instrument, with full knowledge of the fact that defendant made use\u00a0 of\u00a0 such instruments for\u00a0 the\u00a0 purpose of borrowing money thereon.\u00a0\u00a0 And if the other witnesses for the prosecution\u00a0 are to be believed,\u00a0 and\u00a0 we\u00a0 think that\u00a0 the\u00a0 trial judge rightly found\u00a0 that\u00a0 they are,\u00a0 the defendant\u00a0 gave full\u00a0 and particular directions for the preparation of the alleged\u00a0 fraudulent instrument in\u00a0 the presence and within the hearing of various persons who happened to\u00a0 be in his store at the time it was executed, although there\u00a0 was not the slightest necessity for\u00a0 so doing.\u00a0 It would seem that had he been conscious that he was engaged in\u00a0 a fraudulent transaction he\u00a0 would not have thus unnecessarily exposed himself to detection and punishment.<br\/><br\/>The conduct of the complaining\u00a0 witness, the purchaser of the instrument, as disclosed by his own testimony, was such as to raise at least a reasonable doubt in our minds as to whether he was or was not\u00a0 aware of the true nature of the instrument which he\u00a0 discounted.\u00a0\u00a0 He admitted that he bought the draft relying solely on the credit and business reputation of the defendant whose name appeared thereon as acceptor, and that he did not know and made\u00a0 no effort to discover what was the credit or standing of the drawer, payee, and indorsers, or whether any\u00a0 such persons were in existence.\u00a0 He\u00a0 bought the instrument notwithstanding the fact\u00a0 that\u00a0 the signature of the payee does not appear indorsed thereon, and he took it from the Chinese broker who sold\u00a0 it to him, without the broker's indorsement, and\u00a0 relying exclusively, as he says,\u00a0 upon\u00a0 the established\u00a0 credit of the defendant and the assurances of the broker\u00a0 that the defendant would pay it at maturity.\u00a0 Under all the circumstances, and especially in view of\u00a0 the known common practice among Chinese merchants and money lenders to give and\u00a0 receive instruments such\u00a0 as the one in question\u00a0 as evidences\u00a0 of loans and advances, we can\u00a0 not say beyond a reasonable doubt that the complaining witness was in anywise deceived\u00a0 by the form\u00a0 in\u00a0 which the instrument was executed, and indeed we are\u00a0 inclined to believe that he well knew that it was not a draft, as on its face it purported to be, and that it was no more than defendant's promise to pay its face value on maturity of his final acceptance set out therein.<br\/><br\/>It not being proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the transaction set out in the information involved any false pretence or deceit on the part of the defendant whereby the complaining witness was defrauded\u00a0 \"in the substance, quality, or quantity\" of the thing sold to him, defendant's conviction for the crime of\u00a0 estafa can not be sustained. (Art. 534, Penal Code.)<br\/><br\/>It may not be improper here to say that this decision in noway places the\u00a0 stamp of our approval on the extremely reprehensible and\u00a0 dangerous practice referred\u00a0 to\u00a0 above, whereby money is borrowed and advanced by Chinese merchants and money lenders in Manila, on evidences of indebtedness cast in the form of drafts with fictitious drawers, payees, and indorsers.\u00a0 The execution, and the disposal or transfer of such fictitious commercial instruments to innocent purchasers\u00a0 for value, without knowledge of their true character,\u00a0 might well expose the parties not merely to the penalties prescribed on conviction of the crime\u00a0 of estafa but also to the much graver penalties prescribed for the crime of falsification\u00a0 of commercial instruments; and it is to be observed also that proof of the true nature\u00a0 of such evidences of\u00a0 indebtedness would\u00a0 in some\u00a0 cases affect the civil rights and obligations of the parties thereto\u00a0 in ways\u00a0 which, it is\u00a0 probable, are wholly unanticipated by those\u00a0 executing and negotiating them, as to which, however, we express no opinion whatever at this time.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of conviction and the\u00a0 sentence imposed by the trial court should be\u00a0 reversed, and the defendant acquitted of the crime with which he is charged and his bond exonerated, with the costs of\u00a0 both instances <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">de oficio.<\/span>\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i> Johnson, Moreland,<\/i> and <i>Elliott, JJ,<\/i>, concur.<br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Article 444\u00a0 of the Civil Code\u00a0 prescribes that \"Acts which are merely\u00a0 tolerated and\u00a0 those clandestinely executed, without knowledge of.the possessor of the thing,\u00a0 or\u00a0 by force, do not affect the possession.\"<br\/><br\/>Article 446 of the same code provides that \"Every possessor has a right to\u00a0 be respected\u00a0 in his possession;\u00a0 and should he\u00a0 be\u00a0 disturbed\u00a0 therein, he must be protected or possession must be restored to him by the means established in the laws of procedure.\"<br\/><br\/>In\u00a0 accordance with\u00a0 the legal precepts laid down in the preinserted article of\u00a0 the Civil Code,, it is unquestionable that the action for the recovery of possession, prosecuted by the plaintiffs against\u00a0 the defendant, who personally and against the will of the\u00a0 legitimate\u00a0 possessors of the said land, usurped and now holds\u00a0 it, is maintainable under the law.<br\/><br\/>It is a doctrine\u00a0 established by the jurisprudence of this court that, even after the promulgation of the Civil Code, which did\u00a0 not repeal article 1635 of the previous Law of Civil Procedure,\u00a0 the<i> accion publiciana <\/i> subsists to obtain from the court protection of the right of possession.\u00a0 Consequently,\u00a0 the action\u00a0 prosecuted\u00a0 by the, plaintiff for the recovery of\u00a0 the\u00a0 possession\u00a0 unlawfully\u00a0 taken\u00a0 by the defendant is proper, without prejudice to the right\u00a0 that lies with the latter with respect to the\u00a0 ownership, which must be proven\u00a0 in\u00a0 opposition to the presumption of title which already existed in favor of the legitimate possessor who in the present case is the plaintiff, he\u00a0 having enjoyed a quiet and\u00a0 peaceable possession of the land for a period of about twenty years when he\u00a0 was\u00a0 unlawfully deprived\u00a0 thereof by the defendant.\u00a0\u00a0 (Bishop of Cebu <i>vs. <\/i>Mangaron, 6 Phil. Rep., 286.)<br\/><br\/>In the case of Ledesma <i>vs.<\/i>\u00a0 Marcos (9 Phil. Rep., 618), the doctrine is established that the provisions of\u00a0 Act No. 136\u00a0 and\u00a0 the Code of\u00a0 Civil\u00a0 Procedure which\u00a0 give exclusive jurisdiction to the justices of\u00a0 the\u00a0 peace\u00a0 for one year after\u00a0 the cause of action\u00a0 arises, to\u00a0 try cases of detention\u00a0 of real property, do not assume to\u00a0 deprive the Courts of First Instance\u00a0 of their\u00a0 jurisdiction\u00a0 in other cases for the recovery of possession of realty.<br\/><br\/>So that the loss\u00a0 of possession dealt with in article 460 of the Civil Code may only be recovered within one year and one day by means of the action for the recovery of possession prescribed by section\u00a0 80 of the\u00a0 Code of Civil Procedure, but when it\u00a0 is a question of real property its restitution may nevertheless be claimed, in a Court of First Instance, even after one year and one day, by means of the proper plenary action for the recovery of possession, that is,\u00a0 the old action known as<i> publiciana.<br\/><\/i><br\/>The act of spoliation\u00a0 is a positive\u00a0 attempt against\u00a0 the rights of a private party and against public order and must instantly\u00a0 be\u00a0 suppressed,\u00a0 without\u00a0 regard to the\u00a0 title held by\u00a0 the injured party, in\u00a0 order\u00a0 to\u00a0 avoid disturbances in the community and to\u00a0 prevent\u00a0 anyone\u00a0 from taking\u00a0 the administration of justice\u00a0 into his own hands;\u00a0 therefore, whoever possesses a thing as\u00a0 the owner of it,\u00a0 as well as he who holds it merely as tenant while the dominion appertains to another, is entitled to ask for the restitution thereof by prosecuting the proper action\u00a0 against the\u00a0 despoiler, even\u00a0 though the latter be the proprietor or\u00a0 owner of the property.\u00a0 (Roxas <i>vs.<\/i> Mijares, 9 Phil. Rep.,\u00a0 252.)<br\/><br\/>The facts are established in the judgment appealed from, that Ramon\u00a0 Rodriguez,\u00a0 for himself, and in representation of\u00a0 his coheirs, was in possession of the land in question (which is admitted\u00a0 by the defendant); that Taino entered into the possession\u00a0 of the property, not in his own name, but as the representative of Epifania Rodriguez, residing at the present time in\u00a0 Spain, notwithstanding the objection of the plaintiffs: wherefore it is said in the judgment appealed from, in considering the propriety of the restitution, that if the said Epifania Rodriguez\u00a0 has any title of ownership to the said property she may show it on the institution of\u00a0 a\u00a0 proper action.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, and accepting those contained in the judgment appealed from, it is proper in our opinion to affirm, and we do hereby affirm the said judgment, with the costs against the appellant.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i> Arellano, C.

While there were three neighboring houses in\u00a0 that vicinity,\u00a0 they were so\u00a0 far away that a cry made at the house in\u00a0 question could\u00a0 not be heard at either of the others. On the day named, at about 2 o'clock\u00a0 in the morning, the accused and two\u00a0 companions, dressed\u00a0 in black, he and one companion wearing red chevrons on\u00a0 their cuffs, entered the house in question.\u00a0 They were\u00a0 all armed with daggers, bolos, and revolvers.\u00a0 The accused, who appeared to be the leader,\u00a0 called to the household in the name of the law. They awoke and lighted a lamp.\u00a0\u00a0 The accused entered the house and\u00a0 immediately compelled Bonifacio and Mateo to go\u00a0 outside,\u00a0 striking said Bonifacio\u00a0 with a tail\u00a0 of a fish called 'ray'\u00a0 as he passed out.\u00a0 On passing out they\u00a0 were instantly seized and bound\u00a0 together by those outside and one of\u00a0 their\u00a0 captors conducted them\u00a0 to a field of hemp near by.\u00a0 The accused\u00a0 compelled Francisca Magusara and her two children\u00a0 to sit\u00a0 ctown in the\u00a0 house, threatening them with death if they moved.\u00a0 He and\u00a0 his companion then placed a rope around the waist of Rafaela Magusara, threw it over a rafter in the\u00a0 house, and\u00a0 seizing the end thereof, they raised and lowered her, and permitted her to violently drop to the floor several times, for the purpose of compelling her to disclose where her\u00a0 money was hidden. They then unbound her\u00a0 and\u00a0 took her with them to another part of the house\u00a0 separated from the\u00a0 others\u00a0 by\u00a0 a curtain\u00a0 of matting, where\u00a0 they\u00a0 broke open trunks\u00a0 and appropriated\u00a0 the contents, including her money.\u00a0 In the meantime Francisca and her\u00a0 children\u00a0 escaped from the house, taking different directions.\u00a0 On\u00a0 the following day they were found in the forest.\u00a0 Some moments after\u00a0 their escape Rafaela Magusara, still conducted by\u00a0 her captors, passed near\u00a0 the place\u00a0 where Bonifacio and\u00a0 Mateo\u00a0 were being detained in the\u00a0 direction of the\u00a0 seashore\u00a0 opposite the little island of Murcielagos, called also Cagban. When the accused passed near where Bonifacio and Mateo\u00a0 were detained, he called to the one who was guarding them to go\u00a0 to the house and get a bag\u00a0 of money\u00a0 which he\u00a0 had forgotten, he\u00a0 himself standing guard\u00a0 over the prisoners, who were about 10 meters distant.\u00a0 Bonifacio availed\u00a0 himself of this\u00a0 opportunity to loosen\u00a0 the rope with which he and Mateo were bound,\u00a0 telling the latter to escape.\u00a0 Mateo fled in the\u00a0 direction of a forest, while Bonifacio, being lame, was able to go only a short distance, where he hid himself\u00a0 beneath some dry hemp leaves.\u00a0 When the accused was told of the\u00a0 escape\u00a0 of\u00a0 Bonifacio and Mateo, he said that they\u00a0 ought\u00a0 to have killed them in order that they might not\u00a0 reveal\u00a0 what had been done.\u00a0 On the fourth day after,\u00a0 the\u00a0 corpse of Rafaela\u00a0 was found\u00a0 on\u00a0 the beach of Cagban with two stones tied\u00a0 to the waist, floating on the water, 1 yard deep.\u00a0 The body was substantially nude, with a strip of the skirt on the waist.\u00a0 One\u00a0 foot was gone and there\u00a0 were several\u00a0 serious wounds on\u00a0 the\u00a0 body,\u00a0 among others, one near the navel, from which protruded a portion of the intestines.\u00a0 The right arm and forearm were covered with wounds.<br\/><br\/>\" We have carefully examined the evidence adduced at the trial and are thoroughly\u00a0 satisfied that the court below was quite correct in his conclusions as to the\u00a0 facts proved.\u00a0 The guilt of the defendant is\u00a0 proved beyond a reasonable doubt. In addition to\u00a0 the\u00a0 evidence of the persons who were in the house at the time the robbery and homicide were\u00a0 committed and\u00a0 who testify directly to the\u00a0 commission of the one and circumstantially to the other,\u00a0 the\u00a0 testimony\u00a0 of Florencia Gumiter corroborates and fortifies the case against the accused in\u00a0 a\u00a0 manner that leaves no\u00a0 room for doubt. She had been a servant in the house of the accused for some\u00a0 time\u00a0 prior\u00a0 to the\u00a0 commission of\u00a0 the\u00a0 crime.\u00a0 She testified that prior to the crime she made for the accused, at his order, the\u00a0 red sleeves which\u00a0 the other witnesses testified he wore the night of the crime; that on Thursday before the\u00a0 night of the crime he, accompanied by two other men, left\u00a0 home taking with him the said sleeves and a kris; that the other two were also armed; that on Saturday at about 3 o'clock in the afternoon two of them returned; that one of them carried some money in a handkerchief; that there were blood stains\u00a0 on some\u00a0 of their weapons and on their clothes; that the day following, the witness and the wife of the accused washed the blood out\u00a0 of the garments of the accused; that at the order of the accused, one Guillermo took the\u00a0 money thus\u00a0 brought to Misamis to change it for other money; that the\u00a0 accused, after his return,\u00a0 did\u00a0 not stay\u00a0 at\u00a0 the house, but remained in the forest in hiding, charging the witness that if anyone came looking\u00a0 for\u00a0 him she\u00a0 should say that he had returned\u00a0 to his pueblo; that some days\u00a0 after the crime the wife of the accused\u00a0 returned from Oroquieta, where she had\u00a0 been\u00a0 to attend church, and told her\u00a0 husband that they were looking for\u00a0 him; that\u00a0 thereupon the accused became very\u00a0 much frightened, and leaving the house ran to the woods; that on Tuesday\u00a0 following he and his companions\u00a0 started for the Island of Siquijor on a very rainy night.<br\/><br\/>The evidence fully justifying the conviction, and\u00a0 there being\u00a0 no error in the record\u00a0 of which the accused\u00a0 may complain, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed with costs against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Petra de Chaves, on the south by that of Sra. Custodia de Chavez and Calle Real, which leads to the pueblo named Progreso, on the east by the land of the deceased Juan Galientes and the heirs of Hipolito Vilches, and on the west by that of the said Petra de Chavez and Calle Progreso, mortgages the said lot to Mr. Juan Icamina for the sum of three hundred pesos\u00a0 ($300)\u00a0 Mexican currency, which were received by him on a previous date.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2) This mortgage is made only to secure the amount mentioned for a period of three years counting from this date, and if at the expiration of the said term Mr. Ronsalez should be unable to effect the redemption, Mr. Icamina may dispose of the land, unless before the term of the mortgage expires a new contract should be made or the land should be sold at an increased price under such terms of agreement as may be acceptable to both of us.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 The land shall for the present be under the control of Mr. Ronsalez and he shall pay to Mr. Icamina yearly three pesos and fifty cents a month as rental or as interest on the principal loaned.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (4) If Mr. Ronsalez perchance should be able to pay off the mortgage he may do so, even before the termination of the three-year period, to Mr. Icamina, who shall receipt therefor; but he shall always pay the interest of three pesos and fifty centimos a month until complete payment shall have been made.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (5)\u00a0 I certify that the Aguilay land, according to the exact assessed valuation, is worth one thousand pesos; this is a reasonable valuation.\u00a0\u00a0 In witness of this instrument, which for the purpose of greater security has been made in duplicate, one copy thereof to be kept by each, we, the contracting parties, hereunto affix our signatures, before the witnesses present, in the pueblo of Jordan, on the date <i>ut supra<\/i>. -\u00a0 (Signed) Felix Ronsalez, Rufino Ramos, Juan Icamina, Aurelio Zambarrano.\"<\/blockquote>That the said Juan Icamina transferred to the plaintiff all his rights of action acquired by virtue of the said instrument, which transfer is of the following tenor:<br\/><blockquote>\"I hereby cede, transfer, and alienate in favor of D. Pedro Gamboa, a resident of this municipality of Iloilo, Province of Iloilo, Philippine Islands, all the rights and rights of action which I have in the preceding instrument, and Mr. Gamboa may exercise his rights in such manner as may be proper, in accordance with law. In witness whereof, I hereunto affix my signature, in Iloilo, this 19th day of April, 1909, A. D. -\u00a0 (Signed) Juan Icamina. -\u00a0 (Signed) in the presence of Hugo de Chavez and Miguel Gargollo.\u00a0 - Heading and title.\u00a0 - In the municipality of Iloilo of the province mentioned, on this 19th day of April, 1909, personally appeared before me Mr. Juan Icamina, whom I certify that I know to be the same person who executed and subscribed the preceding instrument and ratified it as an act of his own free will. The interested party did not exhibit to me his certificate of registration, as he was exempt from the said tax on account of his being over 61 years of age. Before me (Signed) S. Lizarraga, notary public.\u00a0 My appointment expires December 31, 1910.\" - There is affixed a 20-centavo documentary stamp.<\/blockquote>That, at the expiration of the term of three years from the date of the execution of the instrument, the defendant did not redeem the land in accordance with the obligation he assumed, as set forth in paragraph 2 of the instrument referred to, nor, prior to the expiration of the period for redemption, was the contract renewed, nor any final instrument of sale executed.<br\/><br\/>That the defendant has at no time paid to Juan Icamina nor to the undersigned the sum of P3.50, which he bound himself to pay monthly.<br\/><br\/>That the defendant was requested by Juan Icamina, and by me after the transfer of the instrument, either to pay the sum of P300 and the P3.50 as rent which he was obliged to pay monthly, or to execute a definitive, public, and legal instrument in favor of the plaintiff as the transferee of Juan Icamina; and that the said defendant refused and still refuses to pay the said amounts or to execute the said instrument. Wherefore the plaintiff prays that judgment be rendered by sentencing the defendant to the payment of the sum of P300, and the rental of the land at the rate of P3.50 from the date of the execution of the instrument, together with the interest on these amounts, or to execute an absolute legal deed in favor of the plaintiff, and to pay the costs.<br\/><br\/>The defendant, Felix Ronsalez, in answer to the new amended complaint, alleged: That he admitted the facts set forth in the said amended complaint, except such of them as were specifically denied in his present answer; that the defendant had not refused and did not then refuse to pay what he was owing to the plaintiff transferee, and did in fact offer him payment thereof in a formal letter to the plaintiff before the filing of this suit, and that he was then and always willing to pay his debt to the plaintiff, except the interest demanded by the latter on the said sum. As a defense or special counterclaim, the defendant alleged that the interest then demanded of him had been remitted by Juan Icamina, long before the transfer of the latter's rights to the plaintiff transferee, by virtue of which transfer the plaintiff had no right of action to claim the said interest. The defendant therefore prayed that the complaint be dismissed, with the costs against the plaintiff. The case came to trial on August 18, 1909, when oral evidence was introduced by both sides and the documents exhibited were attached to the records. Among such exhibits was a letter of the date of May 14,1909, which reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Messrs. Pedro Gamboa and Juan Icamina, present. - Dear Sirs: In conformity with the extension of time granted me by Mr. Juan Icamina for the payment during the present month of the sum of P300, which I am owing him, I hereby place at your disposal the said amount of P300 in payment of the said debt. This sum will be delivered to you on the execution of the instrument of cancellation. -\u00a0 Yours very respectfully, Felix Ronsalez.\"<\/blockquote>The letter written in the Visayan dialect and translated into Spanish, found on page 2 of the record, is of the following1 purport:<br\/><blockquote>\"Mr. Felix Ronsalez. - My dear <i>compadre<\/i>: I write to you because the term agreed upon by us for the redemption of the land which you mortgaged has already expired. Your <i>comadre<\/i> is displeased, for there is some one to whom we have to pay the amount. I therefore wish, <i>compadre,<\/i> that you would redeem the property, as we need the money to give it to Catalbas to pay for our land which was sold at auction and we are counting on it to make that payment. You well knew that I relied on you to redeem it soon, and by your answer I shall know the result, for I am in a strait; never mind the interest, but only the P300. - Very respectfully.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Signed) Juan Icamina. - July 20, 1908.\"<\/blockquote>This last part of the translation being impugned by the plaintiff's counsel and submitted to the court, it was agreed that the controverted part relative to the interest on the debt should be translated in the following manner: \"So I rely on you to redeem it soon and by your answer I shall know about your success in the matter, for I am in need, not <i>the interest, only the P300.<\/i>\" (P. 4 of the record.) The court, in view of the evidence, on August 27 of the year aforesaid, rendered judgment wherein it found that the defendant owed the plaintiff the sum of P300, as principal, and P186 as interest accumulated to date, and ordered the defendant to pay to the court the said sum on or before the first day of its next session, and, in case of insolvency, that a writ of execution issue for the sale of the land situated in Aguilay, barrio of Jordan, municipality of Buenavista, Iloilo, the area of which is that required for the sowing of 8 <i>cavanes<\/i> of seed, and that he pay the costs. From this judgment the defendant's counsel took exception and in a written motion prayed for a reopening of the case, on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the Judgment. The motion was denied, and ah exception to the ruling was taken by the appellant, who duly presented the proper bill of exceptions, which was approved, certified, and forwarded to this court.<br\/><br\/>We sustain at once the opinion of the trial court relative to the contract contained in the document inserted in the amended complaint, being one for the loan of P300 the payment of which, within a term of three years from the 26th of November, 1904, was secured by the lot mentioned therein. We also agree with the finding that the offer to remit the interest stipulated in the said contract at the rate of P3.50 a month, under condition that the debt be paid, was not accepted by the debtor, the defendant, inasmuch as, on account of a judicial demand having been made for the collection of the debt with its interest, the defendant is not entitled to put forward the said compromise in order to elude the payment of the interest stipulated.<br\/><br\/>The defendant, in his amended answer, states that he has never refused and has always been willing to pay his debt and did in fact offer to pay it to the plaintiff before the filing of the complaint, with exception of the interest, which is also demanded of him, for the reason that it was remitted by the transferred Juan Icamina, long before the granting of the said credit.<br\/><br\/>The alleged remission of the interest due is not clearly expressed in the letter alluded to of July 20,1908, addressed by the creditor to the debtor Ronsalez; but even concluding, as did the judge of the lower court, that at the most an offer was made in it to remit the interest under the condition of the immediate payment of the principal, the fact is that the offer was not accepted, for the debt is still unpaid and a judicial demand is made for the collection of the interest.<br\/><br\/>Article 1262 of the Civil Code provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"Consent is shown by the concurrence of the offer and the acceptance of the thing and the cause which are to constitute the contract.<br\/><br\/>\"An acceptance made by letter does not bind the person making the offer but from the time it came to his knowledge. The contract in such case is presumed as executed at the place where the offer was made.\"<\/blockquote>The judgment of the lower court is, therefore, in consonance with the law and the evidence shown by the record, in its conclusion that the defendant owes1 the plaintiff the sum of P300 as principal and P186 as accumulated interest up to August 23, 1909, the date of the said judgment.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the other findings of the judgment, it is to be noted that the credit concerned in this suit is not of the nature of a mortgage, inasmuch as the debt and the security given therefor are recorded in a private document, and not in a public instrument, and consequently are not entered in the registry of property, without which requirement the mortgage can not be considered as validly constituted. It is not sufficient that the contracting parties in any instrument desire the mortgage and so state, but it is necessary that they comply with the provisions established by article 1875 of the Civil Code, which provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"Besides the requisites mentioned in article 1857, it is indispensable, in order that the mortgage may be validly constituted, that the instrument in which it is created be entered in the registry of property.\"<\/blockquote>Although the credit claimed is not secured by mortgage, it is unquestionable that suit may be brought for its collection by the institution of an ordinary action, such as is prosecuted in this case; and the procedure therein being identical with that followed in a mortgage action up to the time of rendering judgment in the Courts of First Instance, as seen by the provisions of sections 89 et seq. and 254 et seq. of the Code of Civil Procedure, no legal ground nor well-founded reason is shown for not sustaining, in the first part of the judgment appealed from, the proceedings had in the present case, bearing in mind the provisions contained in section 2 of the said Code of Civil Procedure.<br\/><br\/>For the reasons above set forth, it is proper, in our opinion, that setting aside or reversing the findings of the judgment appealed from relative to the execution of the mortgage, the payment of the debt on or before the first day of the next session of the court, and the sale of the lot, we should sentence, and we hereby do sentence, the defendant, Felix Ronsalez, to the payment of P300 and the interest stipulated thereon at the rate of P3.50 a month from the date of the contract of November 26, 1904, until the date of payment, and to pay the costs of both instances, and in this sense the said judgment is affirmed.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Rep., 614.)\u00a0 This jurisdiction may be exercised by the Court of First Instance in any province into which such ship or water craft upon which the offense or crime was committed shall come after the commission\u00a0 thereof.\u00a0 Had this offense been committed upon a ship carrying a\u00a0 Philippine registry, there could have been no doubt of the jurisdiction of the court, because it is expressly conferred, and the Act\u00a0 is in accordance with well recognized and\u00a0 established public law.\u00a0 But\u00a0 the <i> Standard<\/i> was a Norwegian\u00a0 vessel, and\u00a0 it is conceded that it was not registered or licensed in the Philippine\u00a0 Islands under\u00a0 the\u00a0 laws thereof.\u00a0 We have then the question whether the court had jurisdiction over an offense of this character, committed on board a foreign ship by the master thereof, when the neglect and omission which constitutes the offense continued during the time the ship was within the territorial waters of the\u00a0 United\u00a0 States. No court of the Philippine Islands had jurisdiction over &amp;n offense or crime committed on the high seas or within the territorial waters of any other country, but when she came within 3 miles\u00a0 of a line drawn from the headlands\u00a0 which embrace the entrance to\u00a0 Manila Bay, she was within territorial waters, and a new set of principles became applicable. (Wheaton, Int. Law (Dana ed.), p. 255, note 105; Bonfils, Le Droit Int., sec. 490 <i>et seq.; <\/i>Latour, La Mer Ter., ch. 1.) The ship and her crew were then subject to the jurisdiction of the territorial sovereign subject\u00a0 to such\u00a0 limitations as have been conceded by that sovereignty through the proper political agency.\u00a0 This offense was committed within territorial waters.\u00a0 From the line which determines these waters the Standard must have traveled at least 25 miles\u00a0 before she came to anchor.\u00a0 During that part of her voyage the violation of the statute continued, and as far as the jurisdiction of the court is concerned, it is immaterial that the same conditions may have existed while\u00a0 the\u00a0 vessel was\u00a0 on the high seas.\u00a0 The offense, assuming that it originated at the port of departure in Formosa, was a continuing one, and every element necessary to constitute it\u00a0 existed during the voyage\u00a0 across the territorial waters.\u00a0 The completed forbidden act was done within American waters, and the court therefore had jurisdiction over the subject-matter of the offense and\u00a0 the person of the offender.<br\/><br\/>The offense then\u00a0 was thus committed within the territorial jurisdiction of the court,\u00a0 but the objection\u00a0 to the jurisdiction raises the\u00a0 further question\u00a0 whether that jurisdiction is restricted by the fact of the nationality of the ship.\u00a0 Every\u00a0 state has\u00a0 complete\u00a0 control and jurisdiction over its territorial waters.\u00a0 According to strict legal right, even public vessels may not enter the ports of a friendly power without permission, but it is now conceded that in the absence of a prohibition such ports are considered as open to the public ships of\u00a0 all friendly powers.\u00a0 The exemption of such vessels from local jurisdiction while within such waters was not established until within comparatively recent times.\u00a0 In 1794,\u00a0 Attorney-General Bradford, and in 1796 Attorney-General Lee, rendered opinions to the effect that \"the laws of nations invest the commander of a foreign ship of war with no exemption from the jurisdiction\u00a0 of the country into which\u00a0 he comes.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (1, Op. U. S. Attys. Gen., 46,\u00a0 87.)\u00a0\u00a0 This theory was\u00a0 also supported by Lord Stowell in an\u00a0 opinion given by him\u00a0 to the British Government as late as 1820. In the leading case of The Schooner <i>Exchange vs.<\/i> McFadden (7 Cranch\u00a0 (U. S.),\u00a0 116,\u00a0 144), Chief Justice\u00a0 Marshall said that\u00a0 the implied license under which such vessels enter a friendly port may reasonably be construed as\u00a0 \"containing exemption from\u00a0 jurisdiction\u00a0 of the sovereign\u00a0 within whose territory she claims the rights of hospitality.\"\u00a0 The principle was accepted by the Geneva Arbitration Tribunal, which\u00a0 announced that \"the privilege of exterritoriality accorded to vessels\u00a0 of war has been admitted in the law of nations; not\u00a0 as an absolute right, but solely\u00a0 as a proceeding\u00a0 founded on\u00a0 the principle of courtesy and mutual deference between nations.\"\u00a0 (2 Moore, Int. Law Dig., sees.\u00a0 252 and 254; Hall, Int. Law, sec. 55; Taylor, Int. Law, sec. 256; Ortolan, Dip. de la Mer, 2. C. X.)<br\/><br\/>Such\u00a0 vessels are\u00a0 therefore permitted\u00a0 during times of peace to come\u00a0 and go freely.\u00a0 Local officials exercise but little control over their actions, and offenses committed by their crews are justiciable by their own officers acting under the laws to which they\u00a0 primarily owe\u00a0 allegiance.\u00a0\u00a0 This limitation upon the general principle of\u00a0 territorial sovereignty is based entirely upon comity and\u00a0 convenience, and finds\u00a0 its justification\u00a0 in\u00a0 the fact\u00a0 that experience shows that such vessels are generally careful to respect local laws and regulations which are essential to the health, order, and well-being of\u00a0 the\u00a0 port.\u00a0 But comity\u00a0 and convenience does not require the extension of the same\u00a0 degree of exemption to merchant vessels.\u00a0 There are two\u00a0 well-defined theories as to the extent of the immunities ordinarily granted to\u00a0 them.\u00a0 According to the\u00a0 French theory\u00a0 and practice, matters\u00a0 happening on board a merchant ship which do not concern\u00a0 the\u00a0 tranquillity of the\u00a0 port or persons foreign to the crew, are justiciable only\u00a0 by the courts of the country to which the vessel belongs.\u00a0 The French\u00a0 courts therefore claim exclusive jurisdiction over crimes committed on board French merchant vessels in foreign ports by one member of the crew\u00a0 against another.\u00a0\u00a0 (See Bonfils, Le Droit Int.

In all\u00a0 such cases\u00a0 it must necessarily be\u00a0 left\u00a0 to\u00a0 the\u00a0 local judicial authorities whether\u00a0 the procedure shall take place in the United States or in Sweden to determine if in fact there has been such disturbance of the local order and tranquillity, and if\u00a0 the complaint is supported by\u00a0 such\u00a0 proof as results in the conviction\u00a0 of\u00a0 the party\u00a0 accused, to visit upon\u00a0 the\u00a0 offenders\u00a0 such punishment as\u00a0 may\u00a0 be defined against\u00a0 the offense\u00a0 by the municipal law of the place.\" (Moore, Int. Law Dig., vol. 2, p. 315.)<\/blockquote>The treaty does not therefore deprive the, local courts of jurisdiction over offenses committed on\u00a0 board a merchant vessel by one member of the crew against another which amount\u00a0 to a disturbance of the order or tranquillity of the country, and\u00a0 a\u00a0 fair\u00a0 and\u00a0 reasonable\u00a0 construction of\u00a0 the language requires us to hold that any violation of criminal laws disturbs the order or tranquillity of the country.\u00a0 The offense with which the appellant is charged had nothing to do with any difference between the\u00a0 captain and the crew. It was a violation by the master of the criminal law of the country into whose port he came.\u00a0 We thus find that neither by reason of the nationality of the vessel, the place of the commission of the offense, or the prohibitions of any treaty or general principle of public\u00a0 law,\u00a0 are the courts\u00a0 of\u00a0 the Philippine Islands deprived of jurisdiction over the offense charged in the information in this case.<br\/><br\/>It is\u00a0 further contended that the complaint is defective because\u00a0 it does not allege that the animals were disembarked at the port of Manila,\u00a0 an allegation\u00a0 which it is claimed is essential to the jurisdiction of the court sitting at that port. To hold\u00a0 with the appellant upon this\u00a0 issue would be to\u00a0 construe the language\u00a0 of\u00a0 the complaint very strictly against the Government.\u00a0 The disembarkation of the animals is not necessary in order to constitute the completed offense, and a reasonable\u00a0 construction of the language of the\u00a0 statute confers jurisdiction upon the court sitting at the port\u00a0 into which the animals are brought.\u00a0 They are then within the territorial jurisdiction\u00a0 of the court,\u00a0 and the\u00a0 mere fact of their disembarkation is immaterial so far as jurisdiction is concerned.\u00a0 This might be different\u00a0 if the disembarkation of the animals constituted a constitutional element\u00a0 in the offense, but it does not.<br\/><br\/>It is also contended that the information is insufficient because it fails to allege that the defendant<i> knowingly\u00a0 and willfully<\/i> failed to provide suitable means for securing said animals while in transit, so as to avoid cruelty and unnecesary suffering.\u00a0\u00a0 The allegation\u00a0 of the complaint that the act was\u00a0 committed willfully includes\u00a0 the allegation that it was\u00a0 committed knowingly.\u00a0 As\u00a0 said in Woodhouse <i>vs.<\/i>\u00a0 Rio Grande R. R. Company\u00a0 (67 Texas, 416),\u00a0 \"the word 'willfully' carries the idea, when used in connection with an act forbidden by law, that the act must be done knowingly or intentionally; that, with knowledge, the will consented to, designed, and directed the act.\"\u00a0 So in Wong: <i>vs<\/i>. City of Astoria (13 Oregon, 538), it was said:\u00a0 \"The first one is that the complaint did not show, in the words of the ordinance, that the appellant 'knowingly' did the act complained of.\u00a0 This\u00a0 point, I think,\u00a0 was fully\u00a0 answered by the respondent's counsel - that the words 'willfully' and\u00a0 'knowingly' conveyed\u00a0 the same meaning.\u00a0 To 'willfully' do an act implies that it was done by design - done for a set purpose; and I think that it would necessarily follow that\u00a0 it was 'knowingly' done.\"\u00a0 To the same effect is Johnson <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>.

The importance of the question thus presented requires a statement of the principles which govern those relations, and consideration of the nature and extent of\u00a0 the legislative power of the Philippine Commission and the Legislature of the Philippines.\u00a0 After much\u00a0 discussion and considerable diversity of opinion certain applicable constitutional doctrines are established.<br\/><br\/>The Constitution confers upon the United States the express power to make war and treaties, and it has the power possessed by all nations to acquire territory by conquest or treaty.\u00a0 Territory\u00a0 thus\u00a0 acquired belongs\u00a0 to\u00a0 the United States, and to guard against the possibility of the power of Congress to provide for its\u00a0 government being questioned, the framers of the\u00a0 Constitution provided in express terms that Congress\u00a0 should\u00a0 have the power\u00a0 \"to\u00a0 dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting territory and other property\u00a0 belonging to the United States.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Art.

To the legislative\u00a0 body of the local government Congress has delegated that portion of legislative power which\u00a0 in its wisdom\u00a0 it\u00a0 deemed\u00a0 necessary for the government of the territory, reserving, however, the right to annul the action of the local legislature and itself legislate directly\u00a0 for the territory.\u00a0 This power has been exercised during the entire period of the history\u00a0 of the United States.\u00a0\u00a0 The right of Congress to\u00a0 delegate such legislative power can no longer be seriously\u00a0 questioned.\u00a0\u00a0 (Dorr <i>vs.<\/i> U.

(Downes <i>vs.<\/i> Bidwell, 182 U.

(Sec. 1, Act of 1902.)<br\/><br\/>In providing for the government of the territory which was acquired by\u00a0 the United States as a result of the war with Spain, the executive and legislative authorities\u00a0 have consistently proceeded\u00a0 in conformity\u00a0 with\u00a0 the\u00a0 principles above stated.\u00a0 The city of Manila was surrendered to the United States on August 13, 1898, and the military commander was directed to\u00a0 hold the\u00a0 city, bay,\u00a0 and\u00a0 harbor, pending the conclusion of a peace which should determine the control, disposition,\u00a0 and government\u00a0 of\u00a0 the Islands. The duty then devolved upon the American authorities to preserve peace and protect persons and property within the occupied territory.\u00a0 Provision therefor was made by proper orders, and on August 26\u00a0 General Merritt assumed the duties of military governor.\u00a0 The treaty of peace was signed December 10,\u00a0 1898.\u00a0 On\u00a0 the 22d of\u00a0 December, 1898, the President announced that the destruction\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 Spanish fleet and the surrender of the city had practically effected the conquest of the Philippine Islands and the suspension of\u00a0 the Spanish sovereignty therein, and that by the treaty of\u00a0 peace the future control, disposition, and government of the Islands had been ceded to the United States.\u00a0\u00a0 During the period of strict military occupation, before the treaty of peace was ratified, and the interim thereafter, until Congress acted\u00a0 (Santiago <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>. Nogueras, 214 U. S., 260), the territory was governed under the military authority of the President as commander in chief.\u00a0\u00a0 Long before Congress took any action, the President organized a civil government, which, however, had its legal justification, like the purely military government which it gradually superseded, in the war power.\u00a0\u00a0 The military power of the President embraced legislative, executive, and judicial functions, all of which he\u00a0 might\u00a0 exercise personally, or through such military or civil agents as he chose to select.\u00a0\u00a0 As stated by Secretary Root in his report for 1901 -<br\/><blockquote>\"The military\u00a0 power\u00a0 in exercise in\u00a0 a\u00a0 territory under military occupation includes executive, legislative,\u00a0 and judicial authority.\u00a0\u00a0 It\u00a0 not\u00a0 infrequently\u00a0 happens\u00a0 that\u00a0 in a single\u00a0 order of a military commander can be\u00a0 found the exercise of all three of these different powers - the exercise of the legislative powers\u00a0 by provisions\u00a0 prescribing a rule of action; of judicial power by\u00a0 determinations of right; and\u00a0 of\u00a0 executive power by the enforcement of the rules prescribed and the rights determined.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>President McKinley desired to\u00a0 transform military into civil government as\u00a0 rapidly as conditions would\u00a0 permit. After full investigation, the organization\u00a0 of civil\u00a0 government was initiated by the appointment of\u00a0 a commission to which civil authority\u00a0 was to be gradually transferred.\u00a0 On September 1, 1900, the authority to exercise, subject to the approval of the President, \"that part of the military power of the President in the Philippine Islands which is\u00a0 legislative in its character\"\u00a0 was transferred from the military government to the Commission, to be exercised under such rules and regulations as should be prescribed by the Secretary of War, until such time as complete civil government should be\u00a0 established,\u00a0 or Congress otherwise provided.\u00a0 The legislative power thus conferred upon the Commission was declared to include \"the making of rules and\u00a0 orders having the effect of law for\u00a0 the raising of revenue\u00a0 by\u00a0 taxes, customs duties, and imposts;\u00a0 the appropriation and expenditure of public funds of the Islands; the establishment of an educational system throughout the Islands; the establishment of a system to\u00a0 secure an efficient civil service;\u00a0 the organization and establishment of courts; the organization and\u00a0 establishment of\u00a0 municipal and departmental governments, and all other\u00a0 matters\u00a0 of a civil nature\u00a0 which\u00a0 the military governor is now competent to provide by rules or orders of a legislative\u00a0 character.\"\u00a0 This grant of legislative power to the Commission was to be exercised in conformity with certain\u00a0\u00a0 declared general principles,\u00a0 and\u00a0 subject\u00a0 to certain\u00a0 specific restrictions for the protection of individual rights.\u00a0 The\u00a0 Commission were\u00a0 to\u00a0 bear in mind that\u00a0 the government to be instituted was \"not for our satisfaction or for the expression\u00a0 of our theoretical views, but for\u00a0 the happiness, peace, and prosperity of the people of the Philippine Islands, and the measures adopted should be made to conform to their customs, their habits, and even\u00a0 their prejudices, to\u00a0 the fullest extent consistent with the accomplishment of the indispensable requisites of just and effective government.\"\u00a0\u00a0 The specific\u00a0 restrictions\u00a0 upon legislative power were found in the declarations that \"no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law; that private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation; that in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation, to be confronted with the witnesses against him, to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense; that excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishment inflicted; that no person shall be put twice in jeopardy for the same offense or be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself; that the right to be secure against unreasonable searches and\u00a0 seizures\u00a0 shall not be violated; that neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall exist except\u00a0 as\u00a0 a punishment for\u00a0 crime; that no bill of attainder or ex post facto law shall be passed; that no law shall be passed abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or of the rights of the people to peaceably assemble and petition the Government for a redress of grievances; that no law shall be made respecting an establishment of\u00a0 religion\u00a0 or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, and that the free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship without discrimination or preference shall forever be allowed.\"<br\/><br\/>To prevent any question as to the legality\u00a0 of these proceedings being raised, the Spooner amendment to the Army Appropriation Bill passed\u00a0 March\u00a0 2,\u00a0 1901, provided\u00a0 that \"all military, civil, and judicial powers necessary to govern the Philippine Islands\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 shall until otherwise provided by Congress be vested\u00a0 in such\u00a0 person\u00a0 and persons, and shall be exercised in such manner, as the President of the United States shall direct, for the establishment of civil government, and for maintaining and protecting the inhabitants of said Islands in the free enjoyment of their liberty, property, and\u00a0 religion.\"\u00a0 Thereafter, on July 4, 1901, the office\u00a0 of\u00a0 Civil Governor was created,\u00a0 and the executive authority, which had\u00a0 been\u00a0 exercised\u00a0 previously by\u00a0 the military governor, was transferred\u00a0 to\u00a0 that\u00a0 official.\u00a0 The government thus created by virtue of the authority of the President as Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy continued to administer the affairs of the Islands under the direction of the President until by the Act of July 1, 1902, Congress assumed control of the situation by the enactment of a law which, in connection with the instructions of April 7, 1900, constitutes the organic law of the Philippine Islands.<br\/><br\/>The Act of July 1, 1902, made no substantial changes in the form\u00a0 of government which the President had\u00a0 erected. Congress\u00a0 adopted the system which was in operation, and approved the action of the President in organizing the government.\u00a0\u00a0 Substantially all the limitations which had been imposed on the legislative power by the President's instructions were included in the law, Congress thus extending to the Islands by legislative act not the\u00a0 Constitution, but all its provisions for the\u00a0 protection of the rights and privileges of individuals which were appropriate under the conditions. The action\u00a0 of\u00a0 the President in\u00a0 creating the Commission with designated powers\u00a0 of government, in creating the office of the Governor-General and Vice-Governor-General, and through the Commission establishing certain executive departments,\u00a0 was\u00a0 expressly\u00a0 approved\u00a0 and\u00a0 ratified.\u00a0 Subsequently\u00a0 the action of the\u00a0 President\u00a0 in imposing\u00a0 a\u00a0 tariff before and after the ratification of the treaty of peace was also ratified and approved by Congress.\u00a0\u00a0 (Act of March 8, 1902; Act of July 1,\u00a0 1902;\u00a0 U.

It is the creation of the United States, acting through the President and Congress, both\u00a0 deriving power from the same source, but from different parts thereof.\u00a0 For its\u00a0 powers and the limitations thereon the Government of the\u00a0 Philippines looked to the orders of the President before Congress acted and the Acts of Congress after it\u00a0 assumed control. Its organic laws are derived from the formally and legally expressed will of the\u00a0 President and Congress,\u00a0 instead of the popular sovereign constituency which lies back of American constitutions.\u00a0 The power to legislate upon any\u00a0 subject relating\u00a0 to the Philippines is primarily\u00a0 in Congress, and when it exercises such power its act is from the viewpoint of the Philippines the legal equivalent of an amendment of a constitution in the United States.<br\/><br\/>Within the limits of its authority the Government of the Philippines is a complete governmental organism with executive, legislative, and judicial departments exercising the functions commonly assigned to such departments.\u00a0 The separation of powers is as complete as in most governments. In neither Federal nor State governments is this separation such as is implied in the abstract statement of the doctrine. For\u00a0 instance, in\u00a0 the\u00a0 Federal Government the Senate\u00a0 exercises executive powers, and the President to some extent controls legislation through the veto power.\u00a0 In a State the governor is not a member of the legislative body, but the veto power enables him to exercise much control over legislation.\u00a0 The Governor-General,\u00a0 the head\u00a0 of the\u00a0 executive department in the Philippine Government,\u00a0 is a member of the Philippine Commission, but as executive he has no veto power.\u00a0 The\u00a0 President and Congress framed, the government on the model with which Americans are familiar, and which has proven best adapted for the advancement of the public interests and the protection of individual rights and privileges.<br\/><br\/>In instituting this form of government the\u00a0 intention must have been to adopt the general constitutional doctrines which are inherent in the system.\u00a0 Hence,\u00a0 under it the Legislature must\u00a0 enact laws subject to\u00a0 the limitations\u00a0 of the organic laws, as Congress must act under the national Constitution,\u00a0 and the States under the national and state constitutions.\u00a0\u00a0 The executive must execute such laws as are constitutionally enacted.\u00a0\u00a0 The judiciary, as in all governments\u00a0 operating\u00a0 under written constitutions, must determine the validity\u00a0 of legislative enactments, as well as the legality\u00a0 of all private and official acts.\u00a0\u00a0 In performing these functions it acts with the same\u00a0 independence as the Federal and State judiciaries in the United\u00a0 States.\u00a0 Under no\u00a0 other constitutional theory could there be that government of laws and not of\u00a0 men which\u00a0 is essential for the protection of rights under a free and orderly government.<br\/><br\/>Such being\u00a0 the constitutional theory of the Government of the Philippine Islands, it is apparent that the courts must consider the question of the validity of an act of the Philippine\u00a0 Commission or the Philippine Legislature, as a State court considers an act of the State legislature.\u00a0\u00a0 The Federal Government exercises such\u00a0 powers\u00a0 only as are expressly or impliedly granted to it by the Constitution of the United States, while the States exercise all powers which have not\u00a0 been granted to\u00a0 the central government.\u00a0\u00a0 The former operates under grants, the latter subject to restrictions.\u00a0 The validity\u00a0 of an Act\u00a0 of Congress depends upon whether the Constitution of the United States contains a grant of express or implied authority to enact it.\u00a0 An act of a State legislature is valid\u00a0 unless the Federal or State constitution expressly or impliedly prohibits its\u00a0 enaction. An Act of the legislative authority of the Philippine Government which has not been expressly disapproved by Congress is valid\u00a0 unless\u00a0 its\u00a0 subject-matter has\u00a0 been covered by congressional legislation, or its\u00a0 enactment forbidden by some provision of the organic laws.<br\/><br\/>The legislative power of the Government of the Philippines is granted in general terms subject to specific limitations.\u00a0\u00a0 The general grant is not alone of power to legislate on certain subjects, but to exercise the legislative power subject to the\u00a0 restrictions stated.\u00a0\u00a0 It is true that specific authority is conferred upon the\u00a0 Philippine Government relative to certain subjects of legislation, and that Congress has\u00a0 itself legislated\u00a0 upon certain\u00a0 other subjects.\u00a0\u00a0 These, however, should be\u00a0 viewed simply as enactments on matters wherein Congress\u00a0 was fully informed and ready to\u00a0 act, and not as implying any restriction\u00a0 upon the local legislative authority in other matters.\u00a0\u00a0 (See Opinion\u00a0 of Atty. Gen. of U. S., April 16, 1908.)<br\/><br\/>The fact that Congress\u00a0 reserved the power to\u00a0 annul specific acts of legislation by the Government of the Philippines tends strongly to confirm the view that for\u00a0 purposes of construction the Government of the Philippines should be regarded as one of general instead of enumerated\u00a0 legislative powers.\u00a0 The situation was unusual.\u00a0 The new government was to operate far from the source of its authority. To relieve Congress from the necessity of legislating with reference to details, it was thought better to grant general legislative power to the new government, subject\u00a0 to broad and easily understood prohibitions,\u00a0 and reserve to Congress the power to annul its acts if they met with disapproval. It was therefore provided \"that all\u00a0 laws passed by the Government of the Philippine Islands shall be reported to Congress,\u00a0 which hereby\u00a0 reserves the power and authority to annul the same.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Act of Congress, July 1, 1902, sec. 86.) This provision does not suspend the acts of the Legislature of the Philippines\u00a0 until\u00a0 approved by\u00a0 Congress,\u00a0 or when approved, expressly or by acquiescence,\u00a0 make them the laws of Congress.\u00a0\u00a0 They are valid acts\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 Government of the Philippine Islands\u00a0 until annulled.\u00a0\u00a0 (Miners\u00a0 Bank <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>.

Captain Summerville of the steamship Taming, a very intelligent and experienced seaman, has testified, as a witness in behalf of the Government, and\u00a0 stated positively that\u00a0 since the introduction in the ships with which he is acquainted of the stall system for the transportation of animals and cattle he has suffered no loss whatever during the last year.\u00a0 The defendant has testified, as a witness in his own behalf, that according to his\u00a0 experience the system\u00a0 of carrying\u00a0 cattle loose upon the decks and in the hold is preferable and more secure to the life and comfort of the animals, but this theory of the case is\u00a0 not\u00a0 maintainable, either by the\u00a0 proofs\u00a0 or common reason.\u00a0 It can not be urged with logic\u00a0 that, for instance, three\u00a0 hundred cattle without supports for the feet and without stalls or any other protection for them individually can be safely and suitably carried in times\u00a0 of storm upon the decks and in the holds of ships; such a theory is against the law of nature.\u00a0 One animal falling or pitching, if he is untied or unprotected, might produce a serious panic and the wounding of half the animals upon the ship if transported in the manner found in this case.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The defendant was\u00a0 found guilty, and sentenced to\u00a0 pay a fine of two\u00a0 hundred and fifty\u00a0 pesos, with subsidiary imprisonment in case\u00a0 of\u00a0 insolvency, and to\u00a0 pay the costs. The sentence and judgment is affirmed. So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J.,\u00a0 Torres, Johnson, Carson, <\/i>and <i>Moreland,\u00a0 JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><\/div>",

Under these circumstances, we are of opinion\u00a0 that they must be taken to have waived any other preliminary investigation than that which was accorded them in\u00a0 the court of the justice of the peace\u00a0 of San Fernando, and to have waived those defects in the preliminary proceedings which are now\u00a0 indicated by\u00a0 the counsel upon\u00a0 appeal.\u00a0\u00a0 It has been\u00a0 uniformly held, not\u00a0 only\u00a0 by\u00a0 this\u00a0 court\u00a0 but by\u00a0 the various courts\u00a0 of the United States, that when\u00a0 provision is made for the preliminary trial\u00a0 of accused persons by a justice of\u00a0 the peace, this right is one which may be waived by the accused (People <i>vs<\/i>.\u00a0 Tarbox, 115 Cal., 57; 47 Pac.

On or about the\u00a0 16th day of September, 1907, the plaintiff\u00a0 executed a notarial deed in Tagalog in favor of the defendant,\u00a0 an exact copy of which, together with its Spanish translation, is attached as Exhibit A,\u00a0 and forms an integral part of this complaint.<br\/><br\/>\"2. The deed mentioned in the foregoing paragraph refers to the sale\u00a0 with <i>pacto de retro<\/i>, within the term of one year from the execution thereof, of a rice field, for P149.80, made by the plaintiff in favor of the defendant, the description of which land is as follows:<br\/><br\/>\"It is located in\u00a0 the barrio\u00a0 of Tubuan, municipality of Pila, La Laguna, and has an area\u00a0 of about two <i> cavanes<\/i> of rice\u00a0 seed or\u00a0 3,783\u00a0 square\u00a0 meters, and\u00a0 is bounded on the north by the shore of the Laguna de\u00a0 Bay;\u00a0 on the east, by land belonging to D. Benito Lacdang; on the south, by land belonging to D. Higino Benitez; and on\u00a0 the west, by an irrigation ditch, known as 'Paraan.'<br\/><br\/>\"3. On or\u00a0 about\u00a0 the 16th\u00a0 of September,\u00a0 1908, Jose Rinon, of Pila, representing the plaintiff, called on\u00a0 the defendant to\u00a0 redeem the land described in\u00a0 this complaint, and was\u00a0 there\u00a0 from the morning until late at night;\u00a0 but \"the said defendant\u00a0 was\u00a0 not at his house and\u00a0 did not return that day, and then\u00a0 the\u00a0 said\u00a0 Rinon offered\u00a0 the amount of the repurchase to the plaintiff's wife, but the latter refused to accept the amount, telling him to wait her husband's return. On the following day, that is to say, on the 17th of September, 1908, the said Jose Rinon went to the defendant's house again, but\u00a0 he did not find him.\u00a0 On the third day,\u00a0 that is, on the 18th of the same month of September, 1908, the said Jose Rinon appeared at the\u00a0 defendant's house once more, and having found him there, he offered\u00a0 him the amount of the repurchase of the land in\u00a0 question but the defendant refused to\u00a0 accept it, stating that he recognized no\u00a0 one but the plaintiff, notwithstanding the\u00a0 statement made\u00a0 by Jose Rinon to the effect that he represented the said plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>\"4. On or about the 20th of\u00a0 September, 1908, as\u00a0 soon as the plaintiff became aware of what had happened to\u00a0 his representative, he\u00a0 went to the defendant personally, and in a friendly manner\u00a0 repeatedly offered him the amount of the repurchase, but the latter refused, and still refuses, to allow the redemption desired by the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>\"5. This breach of the contract and bad faith on the part of the defendant has caused plaintiff damages to the extent of P300, for expenses incurred during said friendly demands made in order to effect the repurchase.<br\/><br\/>\"For all the above reasons the plaintiff requests the court to render judgment: (<i>a<\/i>) ordering the defendant to receive from the plaintiff the amount of the repurchase of the land described in this complaint, after the execution of the deed of <i>retracto;<\/i> (<i>b<\/i>) adjudging the defendant to pay the plaintiff the sum of P300 for\u00a0 damages, with the\u00a0 costs of this trial; and (<i>c)<\/i>\u00a0 allowing moreover, any further relief to which he may be entitled in justice and equity.\"<\/blockquote>The defendant presented an answer as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"That he denies each and all\u00a0 of the\u00a0 statements of the complaint generally and specifically, and admits\u00a0 only that the rice field, subject of this complaint, is the same described in Exhibit A of the plaintiff, and as special defense he alleges:<br\/><br\/>\"That the right of repurchase alleged by the plaintiff has elapsed according to the precise terms of the\u00a0 sale made by the said plaintiff in favor of the defendant.<br\/><br\/>\"Therefore, the defendant asks the court to render\u00a0 judgment in his favor, absolving him from the complaint, with the costs\u00a0 against the plaintiff, and to allow\u00a0 other proper relief.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>After hearing the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause, the lower court rendered a judgment in favor of the plaintiff and\u00a0 against the defendant,\u00a0 permitting the plaintiff to repurchase the\u00a0 land in question, as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"In this case\u00a0 the plaintiff seeks\u00a0 to redeem\u00a0 the land described in the complaint, which he sold to the defendant with <i>pacto de retro<\/i> on or about the 16th day of September,\u00a0 1907, for the sum of P149.80, and for the term of one year, and alleges that on the day of the expiration of\u00a0 the contract, i. e., the 16th\u00a0 of September, 1908,\u00a0 he sent a representative of his to redeem the land and pay the said amount; but, the defendant being absent from his house, the said representative tried to deliver the\u00a0 money to the\u00a0 defendant's wife; the latter, however, several times refused to accept it, and some days later the defendant\u00a0 also refused to accept the money.<br\/><br\/>\"The defendant\u00a0 answered that the sale\u00a0 of\u00a0 the land\u00a0 in question was made, but he denies that the offer to\u00a0 repurchase had been made to him in due time, and that the period has already elapsed.<br\/><br\/>\"The question then is only whether or not the amount,\u00a0 or value of the land sold under <i>pacto de retro,<\/i> was\u00a0 duly offered by the plaintiff on the day of the expiration of the contract.<br\/><br\/>\"The preponderance of the evidence has shown that, as\u00a0 to the land sold under <i>pacto de retro <\/i>by the plaintiff to the defendant for the sum of P149.80, on September\u00a0 16, 1907, an attempt was made to redeem it on September 16, 1908, the last day of the term fixed, and for several\u00a0 days thereafter, which repurchase and\u00a0 delivery of the money to the defendant's\u00a0 wife could not be effected because of the latter's refusal, and that of the defendant himself some days later.<br\/><br\/>\"It is then duly established that the plaintiff\u00a0 did his best to fulfill the terms of the contract, by sending the money\u00a0 to repurchase the land sold\u00a0 under <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">pacto de retro,<\/span> within the term stipulated, and if the repurchase could not be effected, it was due to the behavior and refusal of the defendant, and for this reason the plaintiff is entitled, in my opinion, to repurchase the land in question according to the contract made between the parties.<br\/><br\/>\"Therefore,\u00a0 the court holds\u00a0 that the plaintiff has a right to repurchase the land, after paying the value thereof, that is to say, the sum of P149.80, and the expenses\u00a0 of the deed, and the defendant is accordingly ordered to execute the corresponding deed of resale in favor of the plaintiff, after the repayment of the said amount, the plaintiff having to make the said payment within the period of one month from the day following the notification\u00a0 of this decision,\u00a0 and the defendant shall execute the deed within the period\u00a0 of ten days, and then the\u00a0 land shall\u00a0 be immediately returned to the plaintiff, after\u00a0 payment of\u00a0 the\u00a0 value thereof.\u00a0\u00a0 No special finding as to costs.\u00a0 So ordered.\"<\/blockquote>After receiving notice of this judgment, the defendant presented\u00a0 a motion for\u00a0 a new\u00a0 trial,\u00a0 which motion\u00a0 was denied.\u00a0 The defendant presented no exception to the order of the court denying his motion for a new trial.\u00a0 This court can not therefore examine the evidence adduced during the trial\u00a0 of the cause.<br\/><br\/>In\u00a0 this court\u00a0 the defendant and appellant made the following assignments\u00a0 of error;<br\/><blockquote>\"1.\u00a0 The court erred in rendering judgment against the defendant\u00a0 notwithstanding the fact that it was proved at the trial, and it\u00a0 was admitted as true by the same plaintiff, Luis\u00a0 Fructo, that\u00a0 the\u00a0 period fixed\u00a0 in the\u00a0 contract\u00a0 has elapsed.<br\/><br\/>\"2.\u00a0 The court erred in rendering judgment to the effect that it has been proven\u00a0 that Luis Fructo, plaintiff, endeavored\u00a0 to exercise his right of repurchase\u00a0 of the land in question on September 16,1908.<br\/><br\/>\"3.\u00a0 The\u00a0 court erred in rendering judgment and declaring that the defendant, Maximiano Fuentes, refused to accept the redemption\u00a0 of the land in question on September 16, 1908.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Not being able to examine the evidence\u00a0 adduced during the trial of the cause by reason of the failure of the defendant and appellant to except to the order of the judge denying the motion for a new trial, we are governed by the findings of fact made by the lower court.\u00a0 Under these findings of fact it is clearly shown that the\u00a0 plaintiff, not only on\u00a0 the day when the contract fell due made an effort to pay\u00a0 the amount due for the purpose of repurchasing the land in question, but on several consecutive days\u00a0 was this\u00a0 effort made.\u00a0 Without\u00a0 intending to hold that the\u00a0 vendor of land under\u00a0 a <i>pacto de retro<\/i>\u00a0 does not lose\u00a0 his right\u00a0 to repurchase\u00a0 the same on the day of the\u00a0 maturity of the contract, yet where, as in the present case, at the time\u00a0 of the maturity of the contract, he makes a diligent effort to repurchase, as was done in the present case, and fails by reason of circumstances over which he has no control, we are of the opinion and so hold that he does not thereby lose his right to repurchase his land, by reason of his failure to repurchase on the day of maturity.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the lower court is therefore hereby affirmed with costs.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><i><br\/>Arellano, C.

LEONCIO RADAZA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/>\n<br\/>\nD E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TRENT, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">The appellant, Leoncio Radaza, was tried, convicted, and sentenced to one year of imprisonment and to pay a fine of P5 for the crime of malversation of public funds. He appealed to this court and now insists, first, that the trial court erred in finding that the allegations in the complaint had been established by the proofs presented; and, second, that the trial court erred in qualifying the crime as malversation of public funds.<br\/><br\/>In the month of March, 1908, in the barrio of La Paz, municipality of Burawen, Province of Leyte, Francisco Tirado paid to the appellant the sum of P5, being, as he thought, for the privilege of slaughtering a carabao. The appellant represented himself as having authority and being the person in charge of the collection of these fees. He promised to obtain a receipt for Tirado for this amount. He not only failed to obtain the official receipt for this amount but converted the same to his own use. The appellant at this time was one of the councilors of the town of Burawen and in charge of the barrio of La Paz. The real crime committed by the appellant is that of estafa and not malversation of public funds.<br\/><br\/>The first section of Act No. 1740 provides as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Any bonded officer or employee of the Insular Government, or of any provincial or municipal government, or of the city of Manila, and any other person who, having charge, by reason of his office or employment, of Insular, provincial, or municipal funds or property, or of funds or property of the city of Manila, or of trust or other funds by law required to be kept or deposited by or with such officer, employee, or other person, or by or with any public office, treasury, or other depositary, fails or. refuses to account for the same,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *.\"<\/blockquote>The appellant was not a bonded officer or employee at that time, neither did he take charge of the P5 by reason of his office as councilor. The P5 was not deposited with him under authority of law. It was not his duty, neither did he have authority to collect slaughterhouse fees. He did not act as councilor in receiving the P5, but as a private individual.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Casin, 8 Phil. Rep., 589.)<br\/><br\/>The case of United States <i>vs.<\/i> Togonon (12 Phil. Rep., 516) is easily distinguished from the case at bar. In that case it was alleged in the complaint that Togonon was municipal president of the town of Corella, Province of Gebu; that by reason of his office as such president it was his duty to receive the rents from certain municipal property and deposit the same, as required by law, with the municipal treasurer, and that he did receive such funds as president and convert the same to his own use.\u00a0\u00a0 There was a direct allegation that he received these funds, as required by law, by reason of his office. A demurrer was presented and sustained. The fiscal appealed from the order sustaining the demurrer, and this court held that the allegations in the complaint were sufficient to constitute the crime of malversation of public funds as provided in Act No. 1740, supra. The case was not tried upon its merits, but the order sustaining the demurrer was set aside and the record returned for further proceedings on the complaint.<br\/><br\/>In the case at bar the appellant did not receive the P5 in his official capacity. It was not his duty to collect these fees, and he had no authority to do so. For these reasons he is not guilty of the crime of malversation of public funds, but he is guilty of the crime of<i> estafa,<\/i> as denned and punished in paragraph 5 of article 535, in relation with paragraph 1 of article 534 of the Penal Code.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is, therefore, reversed, and the appellant is sentenced to two months and one day of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">arresto mayor<\/span>, to indemnify the offended party in the sum of P5, to the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, to the accessory penalties provided for in article 61 of the Penal Code, and to pay the costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

FELIZARDA DEVERA\nIGNACIO ET  AL.,  DEFENDANTS. - EUGENIA  LICHAUCO, APPELLANT.<br\/>\n<br\/>\nD E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>JOHNSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">On\u00a0 the 23d day of December,\u00a0 1905, the plaintiff\u00a0 commenced an action in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila to foreclose a\u00a0 certain mortgage, for the sum of P5,000, with interest, alleged to have been executed on the 16th day of August,\u00a0 1861,\u00a0 by one Antonio Enriquez to the plaintiff.\u00a0\u00a0 The execution of the\u00a0 mortgage in\u00a0 1861 by the person indicated and its nonpayment\u00a0 are\u00a0 admitted facts. The principal\u00a0 defense made by\u00a0 the defendant is that the plaintiff failed to comply with the provisions of the Mortgage Law relative to the registration of the said mortgage in\u00a0 the new registration.\u00a0 The\u00a0 mortgage\u00a0 was originally recorded\u00a0 in the<i> Contaduria, Anotaduria, or Receptoria<\/i> of mortgages in accordance with the law in force before the Mortgage Law was\u00a0 put into operation\u00a0 in the Philippine Islands.\u00a0 Paragraph\u00a0 2 of article 397 of the new Mortgage Law requires in part\u00a0 that \"Records of annuities, mortgages, Hens, or\u00a0 any other class of real rights,\u00a0 contained in said books existing in the 'Contadurias,' 'Anotadurias,' or 'Receptorias' of mortgages\u00a0 must be transferred to the books of the new registry within a period of one year from the time of the promulgation of this law.\u00a0\u00a0 This transfer must be made at the request of an interested party.\"<br\/><br\/>Paragraph 3 of said article provides that \"\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 If the request is filed at\u00a0 a subsequent date\u00a0 it can not prejudice third persons.\"<br\/><br\/>Article 29 of the said\u00a0 Mortgage Law provides that \"The ownership of any\u00a0 other\u00a0 property right which\u00a0 is expressly mentioned in the record or cautionary notice, although it does not appear in the registry\u00a0 as a separate and\u00a0 special entry, shall be effectual against third persons from the date of the entry of presentation of the respective instruments.\"<br\/><br\/>In the present case the property covered by the said mortgage was transferred by Antonio Enriquez and by his transferee\u00a0 several times,\u00a0 by\u00a0 deeds of transfer.\u00a0 Each deed of transfer contained the statement\u00a0 that there\u00a0 existed against such property a mortgage in favor of the\u00a0 plaintiff.\u00a0 The deed of transfer of the present defendant also contains the statement which is found in all the other transfers,\u00a0 which is, \"It appears\u00a0 to be encumbered with a mortgage for the sum of 5,000 pesos in favor of the funds of the Sagrada Mitra of this city, according to the above-mentioned\u00a0 registration.\"<br\/><br\/>Exhibit B, the very document under which the defendant claims title, appears to have been recorded on the 25th day of May,\u00a0 1902, at page 148, volume 5, of the new registry. This\u00a0 registration also\u00a0 mentions the property\u00a0 right in question,\u00a0 gives the\u00a0 amount of the\u00a0 property,\u00a0 the rate of interest and the name of the mortgagee, and a description of the\u00a0 property mortgaged.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 registration seems to contain practically all of the important particulars required by the new Mortgage Law.<br\/><br\/>The deed of transfer of the property in\u00a0 question to the defendant having contained a statement of the fact that there existed against the land a mortgage\u00a0 in favor of the plaintiff for the\u00a0 sum of P5,000 and practically all of the facts relating to\u00a0 the said mortgage, he certainly is not in a position to\u00a0 claim ignorance of the existence of said mortgage, even though the same\u00a0 was not registered under the new registration in conformity with the Mortgage Law. The\u00a0 purpose of registering an instrument relating to land, annuities, mortgages, liens, or any other class of real rights is to\u00a0 give notice\u00a0 to\u00a0 persons interested of the\u00a0 existence of these various liens\u00a0 against the property.\u00a0 If\u00a0 the parties interested\u00a0 have <i>actual notice<\/i> of the existence of such liens,\u00a0 then the necessity for registration does not exist.\u00a0 Neither can one who has actual notice of existing liens acquire any rights in\u00a0 such property free from such, liens by the mere fact that\u00a0 such liens have not been recorded.<br\/><br\/>It is our conclusion, therefore, that the defendant having had actual notice of the existence\u00a0 of the mortgage\u00a0 in question against the property can not take\u00a0 advantage of the failure\u00a0 of the plaintiff to\u00a0 have the same transferred to the new registry under the Mortgage Law.\u00a0\u00a0 <i>The effect of his actual notice is equivalent to the registration of said mortgage\u00a0 under the Mortgage Law.<\/i><br\/><br\/>The defendant makes the further objection that\u00a0 the said cause of action is prescribed.\u00a0 It is admitted that the interest was paid on the said mortgage until the year 1881. The existence of the debt having been recognized until 1881, the prescription did not begin to run until that\u00a0 date.\u00a0 The period of prescription commenced prior to the\u00a0 enactment of the Civil Code.\u00a0\u00a0 Article 1939 of the Civil Code provides: \"Prescription,\u00a0 which began\u00a0 to\u00a0 run before the publication of this code, shall be governed by the prior laws; but if, after this code became operative, all the time required in the same for prescription has elapsed, it shall be effectual, even if according to said prior laws a longer period of time may be required.\"<br\/><br\/>The law covering prescription\u00a0 in cases like the present is law 5, book 11, title 8 of the <i>Novisima Recopilacion<\/i> (Law 63 of Toro).\u00a0 Under this law the\u00a0 period of prescription for actions like\u00a0 the\u00a0 present was\u00a0 thirty years.\u00a0 The present action was commenced on the 23d day of December, 1905. It will\u00a0 be seen, therefore, that the period of prescription of thirty years has not yet\u00a0 expired.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 defense of\u00a0 prescription is therefore not tenable and the. cause of action is not barred by\u00a0 prescription.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff asked for a judgment for the sum of P5,000, the amount of\u00a0 said mortgage, with interest at the rate of 6 per cent from the 30th of May, 1881.\u00a0\u00a0 The defendants contend that under\u00a0 articles\u00a0 114 and 145 of the Mortgage Law the plaintiff\u00a0 can not recover interest for more than the two years\u00a0 immediately\u00a0 preceding the judgment.\u00a0\u00a0 The plaintiff admits that by virtue of said sections of the Mortgage Law it is\u00a0 only entitled to recover interest for the\u00a0 two years\u00a0 last\u00a0 past,\u00a0 immediately preceding the date of\u00a0 the judgment.<br\/><br\/>Article 114 provides that \"A\u00a0 mortgage created in favor of an interest-paying debt shall secure to the prejudice of third persons, besides the capital, only the\u00a0 interest for the two years last past and such part\u00a0 as is due for the current year.\"<br\/><br\/>Article 145 provides that\u00a0 \"The interest\u00a0 on\u00a0 a\u00a0 loan shall not be considered secured with the mortgage in the manner prescribed by article 114, unless\u00a0 the stipulation and amount of said interest\u00a0 appear in the same record.\"<br\/><br\/>By\u00a0 virtue of all of the foregoing, it\u00a0 is\u00a0 hereby\u00a0 ordered and decreed that the\u00a0 plaintiff have and\u00a0 recover from\u00a0 the defendants the sum of P5,000, with interest from the 14th of August, 1906, at the\u00a0 rate of 6 per cent, with costs, and in default\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 payment of said\u00a0 sum, the property\u00a0 described\u00a0 in\u00a0 the complaint\u00a0 may be sold\u00a0 for the purpose of satisfying the amount\u00a0 of this judgment and costs; provided, however, that by virtue of the fact\u00a0 that the defendants in the purchase of the property in question did not assume, so far as the record shows, the payment of the said mortgage, they\u00a0 (the defendants) are not responsible\u00a0 in any way\u00a0 for the payment of any sum which\u00a0 may remain due after\u00a0 the sale of said land.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 defendants are not responsible\u00a0 for the payment of any deficiency which may\u00a0 result from\u00a0 the sale of the property in question.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of\u00a0 the\u00a0 lower court, as herein\u00a0 modified, is hereby affirmed with\u00a0 costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

The foregoing facts were admitted by\u00a0 the contending parties at the trial of the case.<br\/><br\/>On the\u00a0 11th of July, 1906, the other three brothers, Calixto,\u00a0 Severo, and Alejandro\u00a0 Mainit\u00a0 (the last named being under\u00a0 17\u00a0 years of age was represented by a guardian <i>ad litem),<\/i> demanded that the said contract be declared null, and that the land sold be\u00a0 returned to them.<br\/><br\/>The defendants, the spouses Bandoy and Tec, who are the present possessors of the land\u00a0 in question, answered the complaint and acknowledged that Marcelo Mainit had actually sold them the land for the price of 50 pesos.<br\/><br\/>They also agreed that, among other\u00a0 facts, the following be offered in evidence, to wit: (1) That in addition to the 30\u00a0 pesos received by\u00a0 Marcelo Mainit,\u00a0 Calixto Mainit also received 20 pesos from the sale\u00a0 of the land; and (2) that both Marcelo's\u00a0 30 pesos and Calixto's 20 pesos\u00a0 were expended in the care and maintenance of the four brothers, coowners\u00a0 of the land.<br\/><br\/>After all the\u00a0 evidence had been taken the Court of First Instance for the Province of La Laguna \"absolved the defendants of the complaint demanding the nullification of the contract, without special ruling as to costs, without prejudice to the defendants' obligation to\u00a0 pay the plaintiffs the 30 pesos they have offered as an increase over the price paid for the land.\"<br\/><br\/>When plaintiffs were notified of the above judgment they moved for a new trial and gave\u00a0 notice of their intention to appeal therefrom.\u00a0 The motion\u00a0 for a\u00a0 new trial\u00a0 was overruled, but it does not appear that an exception was taken. The bill of exceptions has been submitted to this court with the exception to the final judgment only,\u00a0 on appeal, without a review of the evidence.<br\/><br\/>While the appeal was before\u00a0 this court,\u00a0 one of the appellants, Severo\" \"Mainit,\u00a0 becoming of age,\u00a0 withdrew his appeal for the reason that he had sold his share in the land to said appellees, according to a notarial instrument which was produced.\u00a0\u00a0 The withdrawal was approved by the court on the 27th of September, 1909.<br\/><br\/>On appeal, it appears that the following errors\u00a0 have been assigned: (1) that the amounts\u00a0 paid by the defendants had been expended for the benefit of the plaintiffs; (2)\u00a0 that the contract of sale under pacto de retro executed in\u00a0 1896 by\u00a0 one\u00a0 of the plaintiffs in favor of the\u00a0 defendants\u00a0 was a legal one; (3) that article 1508 of the Civil Code was applicable in this case; (4) in absolving the defendants of the complaint; and (5) in not having declared null the contract above referred to and in not granting\u00a0 the recovery of possession\u00a0 sought in the complaint.<br\/><br\/>With\u00a0 regard to the first, as a question of\u00a0 fact, it would be necessary to adhere to what the trial court has stated in its decision; but really, even though it were proven that the price of the sale had been expended for\u00a0 the benefit\u00a0 of the plaintiffs who were then minors, it does not appear that the acts of a guardian are herein involved, nor was the sale of realty in which\u00a0 minors were interested\u00a0 carried out\u00a0 in accordance with the provisions of the law; it therefore results that the sale of the share of the minor owners was not really a legal one, as alleged in the second assignment of error.<br\/><br\/>It was not a matter of applying the rule of prescription to the action, on\u00a0 account of the lapse of four years since the sale was effected, under the provisions of article 1508 of the Civil Code, inasmuch as an action for redemption is not involved but a question of the nullification of a sale in which three of the coowners of the land sold had taken no part, and for the recovery of possession of\u00a0 the\u00a0 land thus sold; therefore,\u00a0 the third error\u00a0 assigned has also been incurred.<br\/><br\/>With respect\u00a0 to the last allegations of error, the appellants in their brief have shown the illegality of the transaction in\u00a0 the following statement:<br\/><br\/>\"The vendor of the lot in question was the owner of one fourth thereof; when he sold the whole\u00a0 of it he disposed of, as his own property, the other three fourths that did not belong to him; hence, he sold that which was\u00a0 not his own and which he could not validly transfer; for said reason the sale, as far as the said three fourths\u00a0 are\u00a0 concerned, was illegal and without effect.\"\u00a0 (Brief,\u00a0 5.)<br\/><br\/>In a\u00a0 community of\u00a0 property \"every\u00a0 coowner shall have full\u00a0 ownership of his part and in the\u00a0 fruits and\u00a0 benefits derived therefrom, and he therefore may alienate *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.\" (Art. 399,\u00a0 Civil Code.)\u00a0\u00a0 Consequently, the alienation by\" Marcelo Mainit of his fourth part was legal, valid, efficient, and produced the effect of substituting the defendants in the enjoyment thereof.<br\/><br\/>In addition,\u00a0 the latter\u00a0 have also become\u00a0 coowners\u00a0 of another one fourth part which belonged to Severo Mainit, by virtue of the purchase\u00a0 made from him\u00a0 after judgment was rendered,\u00a0 and\u00a0 they\u00a0 at present stand in his place. Therefore, two fourths or one-half of the land belongs now to the defendants, unless Calixto's part has also been acquired,\u00a0 with regard to which no ruling is made.\u00a0\u00a0 Consequently,\u00a0 there\u00a0 is no\u00a0 reason to\u00a0 recover\u00a0 from them\u00a0 the possession\u00a0 of the land, nor to declare that the sale made by Marcelo Mainit of his part is null and void.<br\/><br\/>As the judgment finally\u00a0 provides that by the defendants paying the plaintiffs the 30 pesos offered as an increase they may continue in the ownership of the whole land, such ruling can\u00a0 not be affirmed, because it would amount to\u00a0 imposing on the plaintiffs the necessity of effecting a sale and for a determined price, when it is not a case\u00a0 in which a judicial sentence may be imposed against the free consent of the parties to a contract.<br\/><br\/>In view of the fact that a coownership. is firmly established, between the defendants on the one hand and Calixto Mainit and Alejandro Mainit on the\u00a0 other, an action for nullification\u00a0 or for the recovery of possession\u00a0 can\u00a0 not be maintained.\u00a0\u00a0 In this case, some of the remedies provided by the Civil Code in favor of coheirs and coowners with respect to the division of the property or the consolidation thereof should be resorted to; none of them, not even by implication, appears to have been applied in\u00a0 this case.<br\/><br\/>We therefore decide that\u00a0 the complaint as\u00a0 presented should\u00a0 be dismissed;\u00a0 without any special\u00a0 ruling as to the costs in both instances, it is so ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres,\u00a0 Mapa, Johnson,\u00a0 Carson<\/i>,\u00a0 and <i>Moreland,\u00a0 JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><\/div>",

In compliance with this\u00a0 obligation he made\u00a0 out and signed Exhibit A, which is the daily time report for the 20th of April.\u00a0\u00a0 According to this report, the\u00a0 defendant had eleven laborers in his gang on that day and upon this report these eleven men were paid, at a fixed rate, for their services\". It later developed that only five out of the eleven\u00a0 men had worked for the railroad company on the 20th\u00a0 of April. By reason of this false report, made by the defendant,\u00a0 the railroad company\u00a0 paid six\u00a0 men for\u00a0 services\u00a0 which they never performed, thereby prejudicing the\u00a0 company to\u00a0 the amount of the wages paid these six laborers for that day. The first explanation given\u00a0 by the defendant as to why he included these\u00a0 six names when in fact\u00a0 only\u00a0 five had worked was that he was induced to do so by one Narciso Cordero, while on the trial he\u00a0 changed this statement and insisted that the eleven men named in this private document did actually work on the 20th of April.\u00a0 It has been clearly shown, however, that only five\u00a0 of these eleven men worked on that date.<br\/><br\/>Previous to this time the defendant had been an employee of the same company, and,\u00a0 according to a\u00a0 statement made by him to one Thomas Embry,\u00a0 he had been dismissed on account\u00a0 of having stolen\u00a0 certain\u00a0 property belonging\u00a0 to the company, and that he\u00a0 changed his name to Cayetano Asuncion to avoid detection.<br\/><br\/>Article 304 of the Penal Code\u00a0 provides as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"He who, to the prejudice of a\u00a0 third person or with intent of causing it, shall, in a private document, commit any of the falsifications specified in article 300 shall be punished with the penalties of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">presidio correccional<\/span> in its minimum and\u00a0 medium\u00a0 degrees\u00a0 and a\u00a0 fine\u00a0 of\u00a0 from 625 to\u00a0 6,250 pesetas.\"<\/blockquote>Article 300 of the same code provides, in part, as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"The penalties of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">cadena temporal\u00a0<\/span> and\u00a0 a fine of from 1,250 to 12,500 pesetas shall be imposed on a public official who, taking advantage of his authority, shall commit a falsification.<br\/><br\/>\"2.

At the top end there was a triangle inclosing\u00a0 a\u00a0 rising\u00a0 sun and three stars.\u00a0 The whole background below the triangle was divided lengthwise into two\u00a0 equal parts, one painted or colored\u00a0 red and the\u00a0 other blue.\u00a0 The sun within\u00a0 the triangle represented a rising republic and the three stars the three great subdivisions of the Philippine\u00a0 Archipelago, viz, Luzon, Mindanao, and the Visayas.<br\/><br\/>As will be seen from\u00a0 the above description,\u00a0 the painting on the tablet or sign was not an exact reproduction of the insurgent flag, but it was an exact reproduction of the most prominent features; that is, the triangle with the representation of the sun and three stars.\u00a0 In the preparation of this tablet an exact\u00a0 reproduction of the insurgent flag was not\u00a0 made.\u00a0 This was done intentionally in order to avoid the\u00a0 consequences.\u00a0 But\u00a0 the sign as painted,\u00a0 including the inscription, would produce the same effect upon the minds of the people as it would had it been an exact reproduction of the flag used by the insurgents in the late rebellion.\u00a0\u00a0 In the place where it was exposed it would have been difficult to distinguish the difference between it and the flag itself. The exposing to public view of such a\u00a0 sign or painting was for the express purpose\u00a0 of exciting the people and stirring up hatred in their minds against the constituted authorities, and\u00a0 the tablet\u00a0 was so\u00a0 designed as\u00a0 to accomplish\u00a0 these purposes.\u00a0 To prohibit the display\u00a0 of such signs was\u00a0 one of the principal objects\u00a0 in the enactment of Act No. 1696. The legislative body knew the conditions existing in\u00a0 the country and wisely\u00a0 prohibited the further display of such signs, banners, or devices.\u00a0 The very\u00a0 first section of that Act\u00a0 (No. 1696)\u00a0 provides as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Any person who\u00a0 shall expose, or cause or permit to be exposed, to public view on his own premises, or who shall expose, or cause to\u00a0 be, exposed, to\u00a0 public view,\u00a0 either\u00a0 on his own premises, or elsewhere, any flag, banner, emblem,' or device used during the late insurrection in the Philippine Islands to designate or\u00a0 identify those in armed\u00a0 rebellion against the\u00a0 United\u00a0 States\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 shall\u00a0 be\u00a0 punished *\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 *.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In the case of the United States <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>.

If, for any reason, the duty to be performed is doubtful, the obligation is not regarded as imperative and the applicant will be left to his other remedies. It is equally necessary that the respondent have the power to perform the act concerning which the application for mandamus is made. If the\u00a0 respondent have not the power to perform the act, mandamus will not issue, however clear his duty to perform may be.<br\/><br\/>A glance at the application filed in this proceeding discloses that there is an absence of adequate allegation that it is the duty of the respondent to perform the act or acts prayed for in the application. It is also apparent that there is an entire absence of allegation to the effect that the respondent has the power to perform the act or acts whose performance is prayed for in the petition. On the contrary, it affirmatively appears from the allegations of the petition, and the exhibits annexed thereto, that not only is the propriety of the payment of the claim of relators, as expressed in the findings of the Wood Board and the contract made in connection therewith, very doubtful, but is, in effect, prohibited by the order of the Comptroller until it can be ascertained by investigation whether or not the amounts found by the Wood Board include damages as well as rents. The Comptroller, as appears from the petition, specifically states in one of the exhibits heretofore mentioned, referring to the findings of the Wood Board, that the military authorities in the Philippine Islands \"would not be authorized to cause payments to be made from existing appropriations for rents, of damages under the guise of rents. I know of no appropriation applicable to the payment of such damages, and Congress alone can afford relief.\" He further states in the same exhibit that it is \"clear that for the period covered by lease no more can be paid as rents than the rates named therein, as anything beyond that would be in the nature of a gratuity.\" It appears also from this exhibit that the Comptroller advises the respondent that the findings of the Wood Board are not binding in any way upon him.<br\/><br\/>As to the sums due as rent under the leases executed subsequent to the date of the findings of the Wood Board, it is necessary, in addition to what has been said in relation to the findings of the Wood Board, to say only that there is an entire absence of allegation in the petition that the money for the payment of such rentals has been appropriated and that it is under the control of the respondent. There is also a failure of adequate allegation that respondent lacks all discretion in executing the leases mentioned in the prayer of the petition and of making payments thereunder.<br\/><br\/>The whole case, under the allegations of the petition, smacks of an attempt to settle contractual rights and obligations, express or implied, between the parties and to regulate a course of conduct on the part of the respondent. Mandamus does not lie to require anyone to fulfill contractual obligations or to compel a course of conduct.<br\/><br\/>For these reasons the demurrer is sustained and the petition is dismissed, and the order of Mr. Justice Trent denying the application for an injunction, as expressed in Paragraph XXV of the petition, is hereby affirmed.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There is no special finding as to the costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

that some time in 1902 or 1903 he entered the Philippine Islands without the consent or knowledge of the immigration officers;\u00a0 that at that time he was a laborer, and that he continued to\u00a0 be a laborer in the Philippine Islands until the month of January, 1907; that he failed to procure the certificate of registration prescribed for all Chinese persons by section 6 of Act No. 702 in the time limited therein\u00a0 during which such certificates might be procured; that he offered no sufficient or satisfactory excuse for his\u00a0 failure so\u00a0 to do; and that he continued in the Philippine Islands down to the date of his arrest in these proceedings on or about the 23d day of September, 1909.<br\/><br\/>The only question of fact as to which there is any real dispute is defendant's allegation that from some time about the 1st\u00a0 of\u00a0 January, 1907, down\u00a0 to the date of his arrest he was not employed as a laborer, and was in fact engaged in buying and selling merchandise at a fixed place of business, which business was conducted in his own name.<br\/><br\/>The evidence\u00a0 submitted by\u00a0 the defendant\u00a0 in support\u00a0 of his\u00a0 allegations in this regard is not wholly\u00a0 satisfactory either as to quantity or quality, but we do not deem it necessary to review\u00a0 the findings of the trial court sustaining defendant's contention,\u00a0 because\u00a0 we are of opinion\u00a0 that granting the truth of all the facts\u00a0 relied upon by the defendant, the provisions of the Chinese Immigration Laws imposed upon the court below the imperative duty of causing him to be deported.<br\/><br\/>The precise question upon which the case-turns, as raised by the facts relied\u00a0 upon\u00a0 by the\u00a0 defendant\u00a0 himself,\u00a0 is whether an\u00a0 unregistered Chinese laborer who has made an unlawful entry into these Islands and has taken up his residence and remained therein as a laborer for two or three years thereafter, is subject to deportation in\u00a0 the event that he changes his occupation from that of a\u00a0 laborer to that of a\u00a0 member of one\u00a0 of the privileged classes before an order of deportation is entered against him.<br\/><br\/>On April 14,\u00a0 1899, by Circular No. 13, Division of Customs and Insular Affairs, the Secretary of\u00a0 War declared the\u00a0 laws and regulations governing immigration\u00a0 to\u00a0 the United States to\u00a0 be\u00a0 in effect in the territory under\u00a0 the government of the military forces of the United States, and directed collectors of\u00a0 customs to enforce said laws and regulations until the establishment\u00a0 of immigration stations in said territory, and that said circular was\u00a0 published, for the information\u00a0 of all affected thereby, by the military governor of the Philippine Islands on May 30, 1899, in Circular No. 6, series of\u00a0 1899.\u00a0 Thereafter Congress passed the Act of April 29, 1902, entitled \"An Act. to prohibit the coming into and to regulate the residence within\u00a0 the United States, its Territories, and all territory under its jurisdiction, and the District of Columbia, of Chinese and persons of Chinese descent,\" which\u00a0 Act provides in section 1 as\u00a0 follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"That all laws now in\u00a0 force prohibiting and regulating the coming of Chinese persons and persons of Chinese descent into the\u00a0 United States,\u00a0 and\u00a0 the residence of such persons therein, including sections\u00a0 five, six,\u00a0 seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, thirteen, and fourteen of the Act entitled 'An Act to prohibit the coming of Chinese laborers into the United\u00a0 States,'\u00a0 approved September\u00a0 thirteenth,\u00a0 eighteen hundred and eighty-eight, be, and the same are hereby, re-enacted, extended, and continued so far as the same are not inconsistent with\u00a0 treaty\u00a0 obligations,\u00a0 until otherwise provided by law,\u00a0 and said laws shall also apply to the\u00a0 island territory under the jurisdiction of the United States, and prohibit the immigration\u00a0 of Chinese laborers, not citizens of the United States, from such island territory\u00a0 to\u00a0 the mainland territory of the United States, whether in such island territory\u00a0 at the time of cession or not, and from one portion of the island\u00a0 territory of the United States to another portion\u00a0 of said island territory; Provided, however, That said laws shall not apply to the transit of Chinese laborers from one island\u00a0 to another island of the same group; and any islands within the jurisdiction of any State or the District of Alaska shall be considered a part of\u00a0 the mainland under this section.\"<\/blockquote>Section 4 of said Act provides as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"'That it shall be the\u00a0 duty of every\u00a0 Chinese laborer, other than\u00a0 a citizen,\u00a0 rightfully in and entitled to remain in any of the insular territory of the United States\u00a0 (Hawaii excepted) at the time of the passage of this\u00a0 Act, to obtain within one year thereafter a certificate of residence in the insular territory wherein he resides, which certificate shall entitle him to residence therein, and upon failure to obtain such certificate as herein\u00a0 provided\u00a0 he shall be deported from such insular territory; and\u00a0 the Philippine Commission is authorized and required to make all regulations and provisions necessary for the enforcement of this section in the Philippine Islands, including the form and substance of the certificate of residence so that the\u00a0 same shall clearly\u00a0 and\u00a0 sufficiently identify the\u00a0 holder thereof and enable officials to prevent fraud in the transfer of the same: <i>Provided, however,<\/i> That\u00a0 if said Philippine Commission shall find that it is impossible to complete the registration herein provided for within one\u00a0 year\u00a0 from the passage of this Act, said\u00a0 Commission is hereby\u00a0 authorized and empowered to extend the\u00a0 time for\u00a0 such registration\u00a0 for a further period not exceeding one year.\"<\/blockquote>Pursuant to the authority conferred by Congress in said section 4, the\u00a0 Philippine Commission, on March 27, 1903, passed Act No. 702, entitled \"An Act to regulate the registration of Chinese persons in the Philippine Archipelago, and to carry into effect and enforce the provisions of section four of the Act of Congress approved\u00a0 April twenty-ninth, nineteen hundred\u00a0 and\u00a0 two,\u00a0 entitled 'An\u00a0 Act\u00a0 to prohibit the coming into\u00a0 and\u00a0 to\u00a0 regulate\u00a0 the residence within the United States,\u00a0 its Territories, and all territory under its jurisdiction,\u00a0 and the\u00a0 District of\u00a0 Columbia\u00a0 of Chinese persons and persons of Chinese descent.'\"\u00a0 In section 3 of said Act it is\u00a0 provided as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Each certificate of registration shall contain the name, age, date, and place of birth, registry of birth, if any, local residence, occupation, and photograph of the person therein described, and such other data in respect to him as shall be prescribed\u00a0 by\u00a0 the\u00a0 Insular\u00a0 Collector\u00a0 of\u00a0 Customs,\u00a0 and shall be issued by\u00a0 the proper officer upon payment to him of a fee of fifty cents United States\u00a0 currency, said fee\u00a0 to be accompanied by a true photograph of the applicant\u00a0 in triplicate\u00a0 to the satisfaction of such officer.\"<\/blockquote>Section 5 of\u00a0 said Act provides as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Every Chinese person having a right to be and remain in the Philippine\u00a0 Islands\u00a0 shall\u00a0 obtain the\u00a0 certificate\u00a0 of registration specified in section three of this Act as evidence of such right, shall pay the fee and furnish his photograph in triplicate as in said section prescribed; and every Chinese person found without such certificate within the Philippine Islands after the expiration of the time limited by law for registration shall be presumed,\u00a0 in the absence of satisfactory proof to the contrary, to be a Chinese laborer and shall be subject to deportation as provided in section four of this Act.\u00a0 Every Chinese person shall, on demand of any customs\u00a0 official, police, Constabulary, or other\u00a0 peace officer, exhibit his certificate and\u00a0 on his refusal to do so may be arrested and tried as provided in section four of this Act.\"<\/blockquote>Said section 4,\u00a0 above-mentioned, provides\u00a0 in\u00a0 part as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Any Chinese laborer within the\u00a0 limits of the Philippine Islands who shall neglect, fail, or refuse to\u00a0 obtain within the time prescribed by section four of the Act of Congress of the United States, referred to in section\u00a0 one of this Act, the certificate of\u00a0 registration\u00a0 by this\u00a0 Act provided to be issued, and who shall be found within the Philippine Islands without\u00a0 such\u00a0 certificate of registration after\u00a0 such time has elapsed,\u00a0 may\u00a0 be arrested upon warrant\u00a0 issued by the Court of First Instance of the province or\u00a0 by the\u00a0 justice's court\u00a0 of the municipality returnable before\u00a0 said Court of First Instance, by any customs official, police,\u00a0 Constabulary, or other peace officer of the Philippine Islands and brought before any judge of a Court of First Instance in the Islands, whose duty it shall be to order that such\u00a0 Chinese\u00a0 laborer be deported\u00a0 from the\u00a0 Philippine Islands,\u00a0 either to China or the country from whence he came, unless he shall affirmatively establish clearly\u00a0 and to\u00a0 the satisfaction\u00a0 of such judge, by at\u00a0 least one credible witness\u00a0 other\u00a0 than Chinese, that although lawfully\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 Philippine\u00a0 Islands\u00a0 at\u00a0 and ever since the passage of this Act\u00a0 he\u00a0 has\u00a0 been unable by reason of accident, sickness, or other unavoidable cause to procure the certificate\u00a0 within the time\u00a0 prescribed\u00a0 by law, in which\u00a0 case the\u00a0 court\u00a0 shall order and adjudge\u00a0 that he procure the proper certificate within a reasonable time and such Chinese\u00a0 laborer shall\u00a0 bear and pay the costs of the proceeding: <i>Provided,\u00a0 however,<\/i>\u00a0 That any\u00a0 Chinese\u00a0 laborer failing for any reason\u00a0 to\u00a0 secure the\u00a0 certificate required under\u00a0 this law within two years from\u00a0 the\u00a0 date of its passage shall be deported from the Islands.\u00a0 If it appears that such Chinese laborer had procured a certificate in due time but that the\u00a0 same\u00a0 has been lost or destroyed,\u00a0 he shall be allowed a reasonable time to procure a\u00a0 duplicate from the Insular Collector of Customs or from the\u00a0 officer granting the original certificate, and upon\u00a0 the\u00a0 production\u00a0 of such duplicate such Chinese\u00a0 laborer shall\u00a0 be discharged from custody upon payment of costs.\"<\/blockquote>Section 12 of said Act No. 702 (taken from sec. 2 of the Act of Congress of November 3,\u00a0 1893,\u00a0 amending the Act of May 5, 1892, entitled\u00a0 \"An Act to prohibit the coming of Chinese into the United States\") provided as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"The word 'laborer' or 'laborers' wherever used in this Act shall be construed to mean both skilled and unskilled manual laborers, including Chinese laundrymen and\u00a0 Chinese employed in mining, fishing, huckstering, peddling, or taking, drying or otherwise\u00a0 preserving shell or other fish for home consumption or exportation.<br\/><br\/>\"The term 'merchant' as employed in this Act signifies a\u00a0 person engaged in buying and selling merchandise\u00a0 at a fixed place of business, which business is conducted in his name,\u00a0 and who during the time he claims to be engaged as a\u00a0 merchant does not\u00a0 engage in the\u00a0 performance\u00a0 of any manual labor except such as\u00a0 is necessary in the conduct of his business as such merchant.\u00a0 The definition of 'laborer' and 'merchant' set out in this section shall receive the same construction\u00a0 as that given to it by the\u00a0 Federal\u00a0 courts of the United States and the rulings and regulations of the Treasury Department of the United States.\"<\/blockquote>The\u00a0 manifest purpose and object of all this\u00a0 legislation was to make it unlawful for any Chinese laborer to enter the Philippine Islands or to remain there in the\u00a0 event that he does in fact unlawfully gain an entry; and\u00a0 to subject such persons to deportation,\u00a0 without unnecessarily molesting those Chinese persons, including laborers,\u00a0 who\u00a0 were lawfully\u00a0 in\u00a0 the Philippine Islands at\u00a0 the\u00a0 time\u00a0 when the Chinese Immigration Laws of the United States were extended to the Islands, and whose\u00a0 right to be and remain there is not questioned.<br\/><br\/>To secure these ends a system of registration was provided\u00a0 whereby every\u00a0 Chinese person,\u00a0 including Chinese laborers, \"having a right to be and remain in the Philippine Islands\" could obtain a certificate of registration, the possession of which would serve as a shield against arrest on a charge\u00a0 of\u00a0 being\u00a0 in the country\u00a0 unlawfully; while\u00a0 the failure by a\u00a0 Chinese laborer, not a citizen of the United States, to obtain such\u00a0 a\u00a0 certificate within the time prescribed by law made such laborer subject to deportation, whether he originally had or had not a right to be and remain in the Islands,\u00a0 unless he\u00a0 affirmatively established that by reason of accident,\u00a0 sickness, or other\u00a0 unavoidable cause\u00a0 he\u00a0 was unable to procure one, and further that he was <i>lawfully <\/i> in the Philippine Islands at and ever since the date of the passage of the Registration Act.<br\/><br\/>The facts relied upon by defendant himself disclose that he was and continued to be a Chinese laborer in\u00a0 the Philippine\u00a0 Islands long after\u00a0 the\u00a0 registration period\u00a0 expired; that he did not\u00a0 secure\u00a0 the prescribed certificate; that he had\u00a0 no sufficient reason for his failure to do so;\u00a0 and that he was not lawfully in\u00a0 the Philippine Islands at\u00a0 the time of the\u00a0 passage of\u00a0 the\u00a0 Chinese\u00a0 Registration\u00a0 Act.\u00a0 Manifestly, therefore, his admitted residence within the Islands as a laborer after the registration period has elapsed subjected him to\u00a0 deportation, and when he was found without his certificate and\u00a0 brought before the proper\u00a0 court and these facts established it was the duty of that court to order his deportation in compliance with the express provisions of the statute.<br\/><br\/>Counsel\u00a0 for the appellee contends that since the defendant was a\u00a0 merchant in fact and not a laborer at\u00a0 the time when he was arrested the deportation provisions of the law are not applicable to him.\u00a0\u00a0 But under the letter of the law (sec. 4, Act No.\u00a0 702) it is the duty of the court\u00a0 to order the deportation of any Chinese laborer who fails to obtain the required\u00a0 certificate, and who is found in the Islands after the registration period has expired, and no exception is made therein\u00a0 jn\u00a0 favor of\u00a0 such persons because\u00a0 of a change\u00a0 of status after they have become subject to deportation.\u00a0 To construe the statute so\u00a0 as to inject\u00a0 such an exception into its provisions would be in violation\u00a0 not only of the letter of the law but also of its spirit\u00a0 and intent since it manifestly seeks to prohibit Chinese laborers from entering the Islands, to render such\u00a0 entry\u00a0 unlawful,\u00a0 and to make such persons subject to\u00a0 deportation in the event that they in fact gain an unlawful entry and take\u00a0 up their residence in the\u00a0 Islands; and to deny the right of lawful entry to a Chinese laborer, but to say to him that if by any\u00a0 means he\u00a0 can gain an unlawful\u00a0 entry\u00a0 in\u00a0 the Islands he will be relieved of\u00a0 the\u00a0 consequences flowing from his unlawful\u00a0 act if at any time after he gains his\u00a0 unlawful entrance he changes his status and assumes\u00a0 the occupation of one of the privileged classes, would be to\u00a0 set a premium on the <i>unlawful but successful<\/i> evasion by Chinese\u00a0 laborers of the laws prohibiting their entrance into the Islands,\u00a0 A strained construction of a\u00a0 particular section of a statute which would tend to\u00a0 defeat the main\u00a0 object for which the statute was enacted and to encourage the\u00a0 violations of its principal prohibitory provisions should not be adopted when the language of the section under consideration clearly admits of a construction in harmony with the spirit and intent of the statute as a whole.\u00a0 The\u00a0 failure of a\u00a0 Chinese laborer to comply with the provisions of section 4 of Act No. 702\u00a0 having\u00a0 once rendered his residence unlawful, and he having thus become subject to deportation for\u00a0 lack of the prescribed certificate, his residence continues\u00a0 to be unlawful up to\u00a0 the time when he is \"found within\u00a0 the Philippine Islands without such\u00a0 certificate.\"\u00a0\u00a0 His residence being unlawful he can not lawfully assume the status\u00a0 of a merchant, and\u00a0 of course\u00a0 it is only the\u00a0 lawful status of a merchant which is\u00a0 intended to confer upon a\u00a0 Chinese\u00a0 person\u00a0 the privileges accorded to\u00a0 merchants\u00a0 and members\u00a0 of\u00a0 other privileged classes in\u00a0 territory of\u00a0 the\u00a0 United States.\u00a0 We, therefore, hold that\u00a0 a Chinese laborer who\u00a0 has become subject to deportation\u00a0 for a failure\u00a0 to comply with\u00a0 the provisions of the above-cited section\u00a0 4 of Act No. 702 is not and can not be purged of this\u00a0 liability by the mere fact that after the\u00a0 liability\u00a0 had attached he changed his occupation to that of one of the privileged\u00a0 classes.<br\/><br\/>In support of his contention, counsel for appellee cites the case <i>Ex parte<\/i> Ow Guen\u00a0 (148 Fed. Rep., 926), which he says is the only case he has been able to find which involves the exact\u00a0 question\u00a0 under\u00a0 consideration.\u00a0\u00a0 To our\u00a0 minds neither the authority nor the reasoning1 of that case is conclusive.\u00a0 It is an unappealed judgment of a district judge, and\u00a0 the\u00a0 reasoning rests\u00a0 upon his assumed premise\u00a0 that although the courts are required to adjudge\u00a0 any unregistered Chinese laborer to be unlawfully\u00a0 in the United States at any time when such person is found there and brought to trial on a charge that he is there unlawfully, nevertheless the residence of such person prior to his arrest was\u00a0 lawful and\u00a0 conferred\u00a0 upon him\u00a0 all\u00a0 the\u00a0 privileges incident to a lawful\u00a0 residence in the country.\u00a0 We are unable to\u00a0 understand how a residence can be said to\u00a0 be lawful which the courts\u00a0 are authorized and required by law to adjudge and declare to be unlawful in the event that its legality is submitted to them for adjudication.<br\/><br\/>In the case of The U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Chu Chee (93 Fed. Rep., 797), it was\u00a0 held that \"a Chinese person who obtains entry into the United States without the certificate from the Chinese Government showing him to be a member of the class privileged to enter, which is required by the Acts of Congress, can not establish his right to remain, when arrested under the Act of May 5, 1892,\u00a0 as a Chinese laborer within the United States\u00a0 without the certificate of residence required by law, by proof that since his entry he\u00a0 has not been a laborer, but has followed the occupation of a member of the privileged class.\"\u00a0 And on\u00a0 page 804,\u00a0 in the course of its decision of that\u00a0 case, the United States circuit court of appeals, ninth circuit, through Circuit Judge Morrow, said:<br\/><blockquote>\"But it is contended on the part of the\u00a0 defendants that the status of Chinese aliens domiciled\u00a0 in the United\u00a0 States must be determined according to\u00a0 their status at the time of arrest, and not at the time of entry,\u00a0 and that, upon being arrested, it was competent for them to show by affirmative proof\u00a0 that they\u00a0 were students engaged\u00a0 in acquiring an education in our schools, and, being so engaged, they were not\u00a0 members of the prohibited\u00a0 class,\u00a0 and not\u00a0 subject to deportation.\u00a0\u00a0 When, however, that domicile\u00a0 has been acquired contrary to, and in violation of the laws of the United States,\u00a0 and when, as here, it is\u00a0 only through an unlawful entry into the United States that\u00a0 the Chinese persons secure a residence in\u00a0 this country, they can not purge themselves of their offense\u00a0 by assuming the occupation\u00a0 of members of the\u00a0 privileged class,\u00a0 and establish the right\u00a0 to\u00a0 remain by proof\u00a0 of\u00a0 that character.\u00a0\u00a0 The right of the defendants to land in this country on the claim of being students was dependent upon their producing to the collector of customs, at the port of their arrival, the certificate required\u00a0 by section 6 of\u00a0 the Act of 1882, as amended; and to entitle them to remain here they must thereafter produce the same to the proper authorities whenever lawfully demanded.\"<\/blockquote>While the\u00a0 facts in this case were not strictly\u00a0 analogous to those in the case under consideration,\u00a0 and it may\u00a0 be doubted whether the courts of these Islands would\u00a0 have jurisdiction to\u00a0 issue an order of deportation upon a similar state of facts arising here\u00a0 (a point which\u00a0 we do not now undertake to decide), nevertheless the reasoning\u00a0 of\u00a0 that opinion confirms\u00a0 us\u00a0 in our conclusion that the\u00a0 residence of an unregistered Chinese laborer\u00a0 in these\u00a0 Islands after the date prescribed by law\u00a0 for the\u00a0 issue of registration certificates has elapsed is unlawful and subjects him to deportation, and that his liability to deportation continues\u00a0 as a result of\u00a0 this\u00a0 unlawful\u00a0 residence even though he\u00a0 should thereafter cease to be a laborer in fact.<br\/><br\/>Ten days\u00a0 hereafter let judgment be entered\u00a0 reversing the appealed\u00a0 judgment without costs to either\u00a0 party\u00a0 in this instance, and directing the court\u00a0 below to enter the proper order of deportation in\u00a0 accordance herewith,\u00a0 and twenty days thereafter let the record be returned to the court below. It is so ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.\u00a0 J., Torres, Mapa,\u00a0 Johnson,\u00a0 Moreland,\u00a0 <\/i>and <i>Trent, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><\/div>",

They both left this house and met shortly afterwards in the\u00a0 street\u00a0 (Verdades)\u00a0 in said barrio.\u00a0\u00a0 On meeting\u00a0 there they became engaged in a quarrel, the appellant knocking or pushing Rabe\u00a0 down, then proceeded to maltreat him. At\u00a0 this\u00a0 moment\u00a0 Rabe\u00a0 called \"police!\u00a0 police!\" Gregorio Glindo, a municipal policeman of Pitogo, being on patrol duty that night in said barrio, hearing these words went to the\u00a0 scene, arriving just as the offended\u00a0 party was getting up, and attempted to arrest the appellant, saying to\u00a0 him: \"In\u00a0 the name of the United States, don't move.\"\u00a0 The appellant, on seeing the policeman and hearing this command, said: \"Don't come near, because I will take your life.\"\u00a0 The policeman continued toward the appellant and when very near him the appellant struck at the policeman with a knife. On account of this resistance the policeman could not arrest the appellant\u00a0 at that time, so he went immediately to the house of the councilman of that barrio, Demetrio Pandenio, and\u00a0 reported the\u00a0 matter.\u00a0 Pandenio ordered him to arrest the appellant.\u00a0 He returned to obey this order, being followed by Pandenio.\u00a0\u00a0 They found\u00a0 the appellant in a\u00a0 place called Mutingbayan.\u00a0\u00a0 The policeman attempted to take hold of the\u00a0 appellant, but he resisted, striking at the policeman again with\u00a0 his knife.\u00a0 The councilman\u00a0 then\u00a0 ordered the appellant to submit himself, and on receiving this order the appellant said: \"I\u00a0 do not recognize\u00a0 anyone,\"\u00a0 and struck at the councilman with the knife.<br\/><br\/>The appellant was not arrested on that night on account of this resistance.\u00a0\u00a0 He did not lay hands on or touch\u00a0 with his knife either the policeman or the councilman, but he did refuse\u00a0 to submit himself to the\u00a0 authorities, and resisted arrest.\u00a0 The policeman did not see the appellant knock the priest down, neither did he see him kick the said priest, but he heard the cries of the priest calling for help, saying \"police! police!\"\u00a0 and when he arrived\u00a0 on the scene the priest was\u00a0 just getting up and\u00a0 freeing himself from the appellant.\u00a0\u00a0 When the policeman\u00a0 heard these cries for help he was only a very short distance - some 6 or 8 <i>brazas-<\/i> away, and when he arrived the trouble had not terminated, although\u00a0 no active\u00a0 fighting took place\u00a0 after\u00a0 his arrival. Under these facts and circumstances it was the duty of this police officer to stop this disturbance by\u00a0 placing the defendant under arrest.<br\/><br\/>Any officer charged with the preservation of the\u00a0 public peace\u00a0 may arrest, without a\u00a0 warrant, any person who is committing, or has committed, a breach of the peace in his presence.\u00a0\u00a0 (3 Cyc, 881; Carolina <i>vs.<\/i> McAfee, 10 L.\u00a0 R.

VERONICA ALOJADO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<br\/>\n<br\/>\nD E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">On or about January 22, 1905, Veronica Alojado received, as a loan, from Benito de los Reyes, the sum of P67.60, for the purpose of paying a debt she owed to Olimpia Zaballa. It was agreed between Alojado and Reyes that the debtor should remain as a servant in the house and in the service of her creditor, without any remuneration whatever, until she should find some one who would furnish her with the said sum wherewith to repay the loan. The defendant, Veronica Alojado, afterwards left the house of the plaintiff, on March 12, 1906, without having paid him her debt, nor did she do so at any subsequent date, notwithstanding his demands. The plaintiff, therefore, on the 15th of March, 1906, filed suit in the court of the justice of the peace of Santa Rosa, La Laguna, against Veronica Alojado to recover the said amount or, in a contrary case, to compel her to return to his service. The trial having been had, the justice of the peace, on April 14, 1906, rendered judgment whereby he sentenced the defendant to pay to the plaintiff the sum claimed and declared that, in case the debtor should be insolvent, she should be obliged to fulfill the agreement between her and the plaintiff. The costs of the trial were assessed against the defendant.<br\/><br\/>The defendant appealed from the said judgment to the Court of First Instance to which the plaintiff, after the case had been docketed by the clerk of the court, made a motion on May 4, 1906, requesting that the appeal interposed by the defendant be disallowed, with the costs of both instances against her. The grounds alleged in support of this motion were that the appeal had been filed on the sixth day following that when judgment was rendered in the trial, on April 14th, and that it, therefore, did not come within the period of the five days prescribed by section 76 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as proven by the certificate issued by the justice of the peace of Santa Rosa. The Court of First instance, however, by order of July 16, 1906, overruled the motion of the plaintiff-appellee, for the reasons therein stated, namely, that the defendant was not notified of the judgment rendered in the case on April 14th of that year until the 16th of the same month, and the appeal having been filed four days later, on the 20th, it could be seen that the five days specified by section 76 of the Code of Civil Procedure had not expired. The plaintiff was advised to reproduce his complaint within ten days, in order that due procedure might be had thereupon.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff took exception to the aforementioned order and at the same time reproduced the complaint he had filed in the court of the justice of the peace, in which, after relating the facts herein before stated, added that the defendant, besides the sum above-mentioned, had also received from the plaintiff, under the same conditions, various small amounts between the dates of January 22, 1905, and March 10, 1906, aggregating altogether P11.97, and that they had not been repaid to him. He therefore asked that judgment be rendered sentencing the defendant to comply with the said contract and to pay to the plaintiff the sums referred to, amounting in all to P79.57, and that until this amount should have been paid, the defendant should remain gratuitously in the service of plaintiff's household, and that she should pay the costs of the trial.<br\/><br\/>The defendant, in her written answer of August 15, 1906, to the aforesaid complaint, denied the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the complaint and alleged that, although she had left the plaintiff's service, it was because the latter had paid her no sum whatever for the services she had rendered in his house. The defendant likewise denied the conditions expressed in paragraph 4 of the complaint, averring that the effects purchased, to the amount of P11.97, were in the possession of the plaintiff, who refused to deliver them to her. She therefore asked that she be absolved from the complaint and that the plaintiff be sentenced to pay her damages and the wages due her for the services she had rendered. The case came to trial on October 19, 1906, and, after the production of testimony by both parties, the judge, on November 21st.of the same year, rendered judgment absolving the defendant from the complaint, with the costs against the plaintiff, and sentencing the latter to pay to the former the sum of P2.43, the balance found to exist between the defendant's debt of P79.57 and the wages due her by the plaintiff, which amounted to P82. The plaintiff, on the 6th of December, filed a written exception to the judgment aforesaid, announced his desire to forward a bill of exceptions through the regular channels, and moved for a new trial on the ground that the findings of fact set forth in the judgment were manifestly contrary to the weight of the evidence. This motion was overruled on the 17th of the same month, to which exception was taken by the appellant, who afterwards filed the proper bill of exceptions, which was approved, certified, and forwarded to the clerk of this court.<br\/><br\/>The present suit, initiated in a justice of the peace court and appealed to the Court of First Instance of La Laguna at a time prior to the enactment of Act No. 1627, which went into effect on July 1, 1907, which limited to two instances the procedure to be observed in verbal actions, concerns the collection of a certain sum received as a loan by the defendant from the plaintiff, and of the wages earned by the former for services rendered as a servant in the said plaintiff's house.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding the denial of the defendant, it is a fact clearly proven, as found in the judgment appealed from, that the plaintiff did deliver to Hermenegildo de los Santos the sum of P67.60 to pay a debt which the defendant owed to Olimpia Zaballa, which debt was paid by De los Santos with the knowledge and in behalf of the said defendant who, of her own free will, entered the service of the plaintiff and promised to pay him as soon as she should find the money wherewith to do so.<br\/><br\/>The duty to pay the said sum, as well as that of P11.97 delivered to the defendant in small amounts during the time that she was in the plaintiff's house, is unquestionable, inasmuch as it is a positive debt demandable of the defendant by her creditor. (Arts. 1754,1170, Civil Code.) However, the reason alleged by the plaintiff as a basis for the loan is untenable, to wit, that the defendant was obliged to render service in his house as a servant without remuneration whatever and to remain therein so long as she had not paid her debt, inasmuch as this condition is contrary to law and morality.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <art civil=\"\" code.=\"\"><br\/><br\/>Domestic services are always to be remunerated, and no agreement may subsist in law in which it is stipulated that any domestic service shall be absolutely gratuitous, unless it be admitted that slavery may be established in this country through a covenant entered into between the interested parties.<br\/><br\/>Articles 1583, 1584, and 1585 of the Civil Code prescribe rules governing the hiring of services of domestic servants, the conditions of such hire, the term during which the service may be rendered and the wages that accrue to the servant, also the duties of the latter and of the master. The first of the articles cited provides that a hiring for life by either of the contracting parties is void, and, according to the last of the three articles just mentioned, besides what is prescribed in the preceding articles with regard to masters and servants, the provisions of special laws and local ordinances shall' be observed.<br\/><br\/>During the regime of the former sovereignty, the police regulations governing domestic service, of the date of September 9, 1848, were in force, in article 19 of which it is ordered that all usurious conduct toward the servants and employees of every class is prohibited, and the master who, under pretext of an advance of pay or of having paid the debts or the taxes of his servant, shall have succeeded in retaining the latter in his service at his house, shall be compelled to pay to such servant all arrears due him and any damages he may have occasioned him, and the master shall also be fined.<br\/><br\/>The aforementioned article 1585 of the Civil Code undoubtedly refers to the provisions of the regulations just cited.<br\/><br\/>When legal regulations prohibit even a usurious contract and all abuses prejudicial to subordinates and servants, in connection with their salaries and wages, it will be understood at once that the compact whereby service rendered by a domestic servant in the house of any inhabitant of this country is to be gratuitous, is in all respects reprehensible and censurable; and consequently, the contention of the plaintiff, that until the defendant shall have paid him her debt she must serve him in his house gratuitously is absolutely inadmissible.<br\/><br\/>The trial record discloses no legal reason for the rejection of the findings of fact and of law contained in the judgment appealed from, nor for an allowance of the errors attributed thereto; on the contrary, the reasons herein above stated show the propriety of the said judgment.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, and accepting those set forth in the judgment appealed from, it is proper, in our opinion, to affirm and we hereby affirm the said judgment, with the costs against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

That each of the defendants should pay his own costs, the plaintiffs to pay theirs <i>pro rata<\/i>.\"<\/blockquote>From this sentence and judgment the defendants, Herrero and\u00a0 Lienau, appealed.\u00a0 Jose\u00a0 Castanos\u00a0 Remesal did\u00a0 not appeal.<br\/><br\/>In his oral argument before this court, Herrero,\u00a0 counsel for\u00a0 the\u00a0 appellants,\u00a0 admitted\u00a0 that\u00a0 the\u00a0 claim of Alfredo Balbas Buchipco, which is evidenced by a final judgment, should take priority\u00a0 over that of\u00a0 the appellant Lienau, and consented\u00a0 to its payment\u00a0 according to\u00a0 the\u00a0 judgment\u00a0 of the court below.<br\/><br\/>Counsel\u00a0 for the plaintiffs and\u00a0 appellees in his\u00a0 printed brief asks\u00a0 that\u00a0 this\u00a0 bill of exceptions be dismissed, first, because the appellants\u00a0 did not except to the decision which they seek to\u00a0 have reversed; second, because\u00a0 they did not announce their intention to\u00a0 present a bill of exceptions; and, third, because they did not present this bill of exceptions for approval until twenty-four\u00a0 days after they were notified of the judgment rendered in this case.\u00a0\u00a0 In\u00a0 his oral argument before this court counsel did not strongly Insist upon the first and third propositions.<br\/><br\/>On examination of this record\u00a0 it appears that the judgment was\u00a0 rendered\u00a0 on the 31st\u00a0 of July, 1908.\u00a0 The appellants were notified on the 2d of August of the same year. On the 12th of the same^month\u00a0 (August) they presented a motion for a new trial, which was heard on the 14th of that month and denied.\u00a0\u00a0 The appellants\u00a0 were notified of the order of the court denying their motion for a new trial on the 14th of August, served a copy of the\u00a0 bill of exceptions on the appellees on the 23d and presented the same for approval on the 24th of the same month.<br\/><br\/>These questions were presented to this court for the first time\u00a0 on the\u00a0 hearing\u00a0 of\u00a0 the case upon its\u00a0 merits.\u00a0 They should have been raised\u00a0 and determined by motion before the case was called for hearing.\u00a0 Before the hearing of the case upon\u00a0 its merits\u00a0 all\u00a0 preliminary questions should be disposed of, and when such questions as\u00a0 these are raised for the first time upon the hearing of the case on its merits they come too late.\u00a0 The presentation of a bill of exceptions for approval in due time is equivalent to or involves the announcement of an intention to appeal.<br\/><br\/>The transfer made by Guzman of his interest in\u00a0 the said final judgment against Behn, Meyer\u00a0 &amp; Co. to Pi\u00f1eyro is not\u00a0 questioned, but\u00a0 the\u00a0 appellants insist and discuss at length in their brief that'as Pineyro did not obtain\u00a0 the consent of Herrero when he conveyed to the appellee\u00a0 the said judgment said conveyance was, therefore, null and void, counsel being\u00a0 of the opinion that Pineyro was Herrero's debtor, and in order to constitute a valid novation by the substitution of a new debtor it was necessary to obtain the consent of\u00a0 the said Herrero in accordance with the provisions of article 1205 of the\u00a0 Civil\u00a0 Code.<br\/><br\/>We are unable\u00a0 to see how this\u00a0 question of novation by substitution can enter this case.\u00a0\u00a0 Under the original contract between\u00a0 Guzman and Herrero they were coowners of the judgment against Behn, Meyer\u00a0 &amp; Co.\u00a0\u00a0 Guzman only transferred to Pineyro his interest in the said judgment, and after this transfer was made the coowners were then Pi\u00f1eyro and Herrero.\u00a0 Herrero having transferred on the 26th of October, 1907, all of his right, title, and interest in the said judgment to the appellant Lienau, then Lienau and Pineyro up to the time that Pineyro made the transfer in favor of the appellees were coowners of the said judgment, and after the said Pineyro transferred all his right, title, and interest to the appellees, then the codwners of the said judgment were Lienau and the appellees.\u00a0 Herrero had no interest in the said judgment when\u00a0 Pineyro conveyed his interest to the appellees.\u00a0 Herrero's interest was then owned by Lienau.\u00a0 The appellees acquired by purchase on the 29th of November, 1907, all of jpineyro's interest, but did not acquire any interest whatever in that part of the\u00a0 judgment formerly owned by Herrero, as Pineyro had no authority, being a coowner with Herrero, to sell, or in any way alienate Herrero's interest, neither did he have the right to\u00a0 sell or alienate the interest of\u00a0 Herrero's assignee.\u00a0 None\u00a0 of the parties, except the defendants in the original action, were Herrero's debtors.\u00a0 His interest was one-third of the judgment and his assignee acquired the same rights in said final judgment as Herrero, the assignor, had.<br\/><br\/>Where two or\u00a0 more persons own\u00a0 a thing\u00a0 jointly\u00a0 one is not necessarily the debtor of the others.\u00a0 This is\u00a0 especially true in the\u00a0 case at bar,\u00a0 as the defendants in the original action\u00a0 were the debtors and the coowners of the judgment were the creditors.\u00a0 According to the original record, Jose Guzman remained the\u00a0 plaintiff in that case.\u00a0 The style of the case was not changed after he transferred his interest to Pineyro; in fact, in the execution for the collection of the original judgment, which was issued by the Court of First Instance on the 21st of October, 1908, Jose Guzman is the plaintiff and Behn, Meyer &amp;\u00a0 Co. et al., are the defendants. In compliance with\u00a0 this\u00a0 execution the sheriff on the 21st day\u00a0 of the same month\u00a0 collected from the defendants in that case the sum of P10,199.64, which was the amount of that judgment, together with interest\u00a0 and costs, and on the same day he turned this amount\u00a0 over to the appellees, Luengo &amp; Martinez.\u00a0 According to this execution the sheriff was directed to collect this amount and turn it over to Jose Guzman through his representatives, Luengo &amp; Martinez. This order of the court below to the sheriff is evidently based upon the petition of Luengo &amp; Martinez, dated the 28th of September, 1908.\u00a0\u00a0 In\u00a0 this petition\u00a0 Luengo &amp; Martinez set up the transfer made by Guzman to Pineyro and by Pineyro to them.\u00a0 They allege\u00a0 in the same petition\u00a0 that at the time Herrero made the transfer in favor of Lienau, he (Herrero) owed them\u00a0 the sum of P1,348, and that they had paid as fees to Caringal the sum of P600.<br\/><br\/>The court below in\u00a0 issuing\u00a0 the said order to the sheriff evidently overruled the motion of Lienau dated the 23d of September, 1908, in which motion Lienau set up the transfer made by Herrero\u00a0 to him\u00a0 and accompanied this motion by the public document executed\u00a0 by Herrero in his favor.\u00a0 In the public\u00a0 document of cession from Guzman to\u00a0 Pineyro, Guzman specifically stated that he had\u00a0 entered into a contract with Herrero in which\u00a0 it was agreed that\u00a0 Herrero should receive for\u00a0 his professional services one-third of the amount of the judgment which they might obtain against Behn,\u00a0 Meyer\u00a0 &amp; Co.\u00a0\u00a0 After\u00a0 recognizing this\u00a0 interest of Herrero, he stated, as appears in\u00a0 this document, that he transferred to the said Pineyro all of his\u00a0 (Guzman's) interest in the said\u00a0 suit.\u00a0 He did not transfer, nor attempt to transfer, to Pineyro, Herrero's one-third interest. In the public\u00a0 document of transfer made\u00a0 by Pineyro to the appellees, Luengo &amp; Martinez,\u00a0 it\u00a0 is specifically stated that the said\u00a0 Pineyro transferred\u00a0 all\u00a0 of his interest in said final judgment which he had acquired from\u00a0 Guzman.\u00a0\u00a0 So it is clear that Luengo &amp; Martinez knew that they were\u00a0 not purchasing from\u00a0 Pineyro\u00a0 Herrero's one-third\u00a0 interest.\u00a0 They had no legal right\u00a0 to receive from the sheriff the one-third which belonged, according to the original contract, to Herrero, and when they did receive it under these conditions they thereby became the trustees or depositaries of this amount and not the owners.\u00a0 After they had received this one-third from the sheriff they attempted to deduct a certain amount which they claimed Herrero\u00a0 owed them.\u00a0\u00a0 That they had no right to do this it is sufficient to say that when they acquired by\u00a0 purchase\u00a0 from Pineyro the Guzman interest\u00a0 Herrero had no interest in the said judgment, he having transferred to Lienau all of his rights therein.<br\/><br\/>The appellees insist that they have a right to deduct from the Herrero one-third\u00a0 interest, which one-third\u00a0 belongs to Lienau, P600 which they paid to Marcelo Caringal for his professional services in connection with the injunction case. It appears that after the judgment in favor of Guzman and against Behn, Meyer &amp; Co. had been affirmed by the Supreme Court on the 24th of October, 1907,<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup>and\u00a0 the record returned to the court below for execution of the\u00a0 said judgment, the defendants in that case instituted on the 3d day of December, 1907, in the Court of First Instance, an action against the sheriff et al. to prohibit the collection\u00a0 of that judgment. The court\u00a0 below rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs in this case, Behn, Meyer &amp;\" Co., who were the defendants in the original case, enjoining the sheriff et al. from proceeding with the collection of said judgment.\u00a0 The case was\u00a0 appealed and the judgment\u00a0 of the lower court reversed.\u00a0 Marcelo Caringal represented the judgment creditors\u00a0 that is, the Guzman interest in said case, having been employed\u00a0 by Luengo &amp; Martinez\u00a0 - and received for his services P600 from the said Luengo &amp; Martinez.\u00a0\u00a0 Both Herrero and Lienau knew that Caringal was representing the judgment\u00a0 creditors, but\u00a0 they made no objection.\u00a0\u00a0 They now insist that Luengo &amp; Martinez have no\u00a0 right to deduct this P600\u00a0 from the one-third\u00a0 of\u00a0 the original judgment which they held\u00a0 in trust for the rightful owner.\u00a0 In this we fully agree with the appellants\u00a0 for\u00a0 two reasons;\u00a0 first, because Caringal's fees had not been liquidated; that is, the amount of his fees had not been\u00a0 agreed upon between\u00a0 Luengo &amp; Martinez\u00a0 on the one\u00a0 hand and\u00a0 Herrero\u00a0 and Lienau on the other.\u00a0\u00a0 No attempt had been made to liquidate this account. Herrero and\u00a0 Lienau\u00a0 had had no opportunity to be heard in the matter, the appellees having arbitrarily, without the intervention of Herrero and Lienau, paid Caringal P600 for his services and now seek to deduct this amount from the one-third of said judgment which\u00a0 they held in trust; and, second, because having received the one-third interest as trustees they are not authorized, under the law, to deduct the amount which they might have paid out as attorney's fees in said case.<br\/><br\/>Articles 1195, 1196, and 1200 of the Civil Code provide as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"ART. 1195. Compensation shall take place when two persons, in their own right, are mutually creditors and debtors of each other.<br\/><br\/>\"ART 1196. In order that compensation may be proper, it is required:<br\/><br\/>\"1. That each of the persons bound should be so principally, and that he be at the same time the principal creditor of the\u00a0 other.<br\/><br\/>\"2. That both debts consist of a sum of money or, when the things due are perishable, that they be of the same kind and also of the same Quality, if the latter should have been stipulated.<br\/><br\/>\"3. That both debts be due.<br\/><br\/>\"4. That they be determined and demandable.<br\/><br\/>\"5. That none of them is subject to any retention or suit instituted by a third person,\u00a0 and of which due notice\u00a0 has been given the debtor.\"<br\/><br\/>\"ART. 1200. Compensation shall not be proper when any of the\u00a0 debts arise from a deposit,\u00a0 or from the obligations of the\u00a0 depositary or borrower.\"<br\/><br\/>\"Where two persons are indebted to each other simultaneously, for clear and liquidated debts, compensation takes place from the moment the\u00a0 two debts coexist, and they extinguish each other by the\u00a0 mere operation of law to the amount of their respective sums, without the\u00a0 act of either party,\u00a0 or even\u00a0 their knowledge,\u00a0 at the time, of the existence of such cross debts.\"\u00a0 (34 Cyc, 632, and numerous cases cited therein; also Yap Unki <i>vs.<\/i> Chua Jamco, 14 Phil. Rep., 602.)<\/blockquote>As to whether or not the appellees have a right of action against either Herrero or Lienau, or both, to recover all or a part of the P60O paid by them to Caringal for his professional services this court does not decide.<br\/><br\/>For these reasons we are of the opinion, and so hold, that thejudgment appealed from should be reversed and judgment\u00a0 rendered\u00a0 against\u00a0\u00a0 the\u00a0 appellees\u00a0 for the\u00a0 sum\u00a0 of P3,399.88, together with\u00a0 interest at the rate of 6\u00a0 per cent from the 21st of October, 1908\u00a0 (the\u00a0 date\u00a0 this money w'as turned over to the appellees in trust), and in favor of the appellant Robert Lienau\u00a0 and the\u00a0 appellee Alfredo Balbas Buchipco, Buchipco receiving P715.31,\u00a0 together with legal interest from the date of\u00a0 the judgment in the court below. The clerk of the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila will pay out of the funds deposited by Luengo &amp; Martinez the amount of this\u00a0 judgment in\u00a0 favor of Buchipco, together with\u00a0 interest, and turn the balance over\u00a0 to\u00a0 the appellant Lienau.\u00a0 On this judgment becoming final, execution may issue\u00a0 against\u00a0 Luengo &amp; Martinez for the\u00a0 remainder.

wherefore the latter asks that, ciftor the proper proceedings, judgment be rendered against defendants, directing them to\u00a0 pay to the plaintiff the sum of 7,000 pesos, Mexican currency, or the equivalent in Philippine currency, with legal interest from the date of the complaint, and costs.<br\/><br\/>The defendants having been summoned to appear, and the demurrer interposed to the complaint having been denied and exception filed by the guardian of the defendant Martinez, on September 5, 1906, the defendants in answer stated that with the exception of the contents of the first paragraph of the complaint they denied generally and specifically each and all of the allegations made in the rest of the complaint, and, as a special defense, they set forth that\u00a0 the\u00a0 sum of 7,000 pesos\u00a0 claimed by the\u00a0 plaintiff, on the ground of the false transfer made in his favor by Jose\u00a0 Escalante,\u00a0 was an imaginary sum which the latter had won from Francisco Martinez y Garcia\u00a0 illegally\u00a0 and fraudulently in a game of monte, on which\u00a0 account they pray\u00a0 that they be\u00a0 acquitted of the complaint, with the costs against the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>By a writing of the\u00a0 12th of September of the same year, the plaintiff denied the facts alleged as a\u00a0 special defense by the defendant in\u00a0 his answer and asked for a judgment for the amount claimed, with legal interest, and the costs.<br\/><br\/>The case having come to\u00a0 trial and oral\u00a0 evidence having been adduced by\u00a0 both\u00a0 parties, to the record of\u00a0 which were afterwards united the documents\u00a0 exhibited, the court, on the 19th of\u00a0 June, 1907, rendered judgment, acquitting the defendants of the complaint,\u00a0 with the costs against the plaintiff, who,\u00a0 on being informed thereof, filed an exception to the judgment and announced his\u00a0 intention to\u00a0 present the appropriate bill of exceptions.\u00a0 Moreover, he made a\u00a0 motion, in writing, for a new trial, on the ground that the facts did not justify the judgment of the court, which, he alleged, was contrary to law and the weight of the evidence.\u00a0\u00a0 This motion was denied and exception thereto was taken by the appellant, who duly\u00a0 filed the bill of exceptions, which was approved, certified to, and forwarded to the office of the clerk of this court.<br\/><br\/>Claim is made in this litigation for the payment of a certain sum which the defendant Francisco Martinez had lost in a gambling game known as monte.\u00a0 Article 1798 of the Civil Code prescribes that:<br\/><blockquote>\"The law does not permit any action to claim what is won in a game of chance, luck, or hazard; but the person who loses can not recover what he may\u00a0 have voluntarily\u00a0 paid, unless there should have been fraud, or should he be a minor or incapacitated to administer his property.\"<\/blockquote>Games\u00a0 of chance, luck, or hazard being prohibited\u00a0 by substantive law, it is evident that the same could not permit such a\u00a0 game\u00a0 to support an action to enforce a claim for what was\u00a0 won,\u00a0 inasmuch as such games produce no civil obligation\u00a0 and, consequently,\u00a0 no action\u00a0 whatever may\u00a0 be brought before the courts of justice which would receive the favor and protection of the law.<br\/><br\/>The circumstance of the document, Exhibit A, having been executed before a notary on April 16,1903, by the defendant Martinez in favor of Jose Escalante, who, as proven at the trial, had won from the maker of the\u00a0 instrument the sum of 7,000 pesos,\u00a0 Mexican currency, as therein set forth,\u00a0 in\u00a0 a game of <i>monte,<\/i> and the circumstance of the apparent transfer of this sum by the so-called creditor Escalante to the plaintiff Rafael Azada\u00a0 y Lara by means of an instrument of the same date - a transfer duly made known to the debtor Martinez - do not change the effects of the prohibition established in the above-quoted article, nor is\u00a0 it possible to perceive how,\u00a0 by the execution of the said instruments of debt and of transfer of the debt contracted in a game of chance like that of <i>monte,<\/i>\u00a0 one may lawfully elude the prohibitive provision of the law, inasmuch as, if there exists no obligation to\u00a0 pay what was\u00a0 won in an illicit game like that\u00a0 of <i>monte<\/i>, and if the law does not permit an action before the courts for\u00a0 its recovery, it likewise will not be permissible to demand the payment\u00a0 of such a debt merely\u00a0 because\u00a0 of its acknowledgment in\u00a0 a public instrument and its transfer to a third\u00a0 party by another instrument,\u00a0 which\u00a0 documents do not legalize the debt in face of the absolute prohibition of the law.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, and in view of the fact that the judgment appealed from is found to be in accordance with\u00a0 law and the evidence contained\u00a0 in the 'records, it\u00a0 is proper in our opinion to affirm and we do hereby affirm the same,\u00a0 with the costs against the\u00a0 appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Johnson, Carson,<\/i> and <i>Moreland, JJ.,<\/i> concur.<br\/><br\/><i> Arellano, C.

Trowbridge (petitioners herein) are defendants.<br\/><br\/>Upon the filing of the petition\u00a0 in\u00a0 this court, Mr. Justice Trent granted a preliminary injunction restraining the said lower court from proceeding in said cause until the question could be heard and passed upon by the Supreme Court.<br\/><br\/>The questions presented\u00a0 by this action are so important and the result of the conclusions may\u00a0 be\u00a0 so far reaching that we deem it advisable to make a\u00a0 full statement of all of the facts presented here for consideration.\u00a0 These facts may be more accurately gathered from the pleadings.\u00a0\u00a0 They are as follows:<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">FACTS.<\/span><br\/><\/div><blockquote><div style=\"text-align: center;\">\"SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT.<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"The plaintiffs set forth:<br\/><br\/>\"I. That all the parties in this case reside in the city of Manila, Philippine Islands.<br\/><br\/>\"II. That the plaintiff W. Cameron Forbes is\u00a0 the\u00a0 Governor-General of the Philippine Islands and that the plaintiffs J. E. Harding and C. R. Trowbridge are, respectively, chief of police and chief of the secret service of the city of Manila.<br\/><br\/>\"III.\u00a0 That the defendant A. S. Crossfield is\u00a0 one of the judges of the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila.<br\/><br\/>\"IV. That the defendant Chuoco Tiaco\u00a0 (<i>alias<\/i> Choa Tea) is a foreigner of Chinese nationality and a subject of the Chinese Empire.<br\/><br\/>\"V. That on the 1st of April, 1910, the defendant Chuoco Tiaco (<i>alias<\/i> Choa Tea)\u00a0 filed a suit in the\u00a0 Court of First Instance of the city of Manila against the plaintiffs in which substantially the following allegations and\u00a0 petition were made, alleging that on the 19th of August, 1909, under the orders of the said\u00a0 W. Cameron Forbes, Governor-General of the Philippine Islands, he was deported therefrom and sent to\u00a0 Amoy, China,\u00a0 by the aforesaid J. E. Harding and C. R. Trowbridge, chiefs, as above stated, of the police and of the secret service, respectively, of the city of Manila, and that having been able\u00a0 to return to these Islands he feared, as it was threatened, that he should be again deported by the said defendants, concluding with a petition that a preliminary injunction should be issued against the plaintiffs in this case prohibiting them from deporting the defendant, Chuoco\u00a0 Tiaco\u00a0 (<i>alias<\/i> Choa Tea), and that they be sentenced to pay him P20,000 as\u00a0 an indemnity.<br\/><br\/>\"VI. It is true that the said\u00a0 defendant Chuoco Tiaco (<i>alias<\/i> Choa\u00a0 Tea) was, with eleven others of his nationality, expelled from these Islands and returned to China by the plaintiffs J. E. Harding and C. R. Trowbridge,\u00a0 under the orders of the plaintiff W.\u00a0 Cameron Forbes, on\u00a0 the\u00a0 date mentioned in Paragraph V of this complaint, but the said expulsion was carried out in the public interest of the Government and at the request of the proper representative of the\u00a0 Chinese Government\u00a0 in these\u00a0 Islands, to\u00a0 wit,\u00a0 the consul-general of said country, the said W. Cameron Forbes acting in his official capacity as such\u00a0 Governor-General, the act performed by this plaintiff being one of the Government itself and\u00a0 which the said plaintiff immediately reported to the Secretary of War.<br\/><br\/>\"VII. The said complaint having been filed with the defendant A.\u00a0 S. Crossfield, he, granting the petition, issued against the plaintiffs the injunction requested, prohibiting them from\u00a0 deporting\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant Chuoco Tiaco (<i>alias<\/i> Choa Tea).<br\/><br\/>\"VIII. The plaintiffs, having been summoned in the matter of the said complaint, filed a demurrer against the same and presented a motion asking that the injunction be dissolved, the grounds\u00a0 of the\u00a0 demurrer being that the facts set out in the complaint did not constitute a motive of action, and\u00a0 that the latter was one in which the court lacked jurisdiction to issue such an injunction against the plaintiffs for the\u00a0 reasons set out in\u00a0 the complaint; notwithstanding which, the\u00a0 defendant\u00a0 A. S. Crossfield overruled\u00a0 the\u00a0 demurrer\u00a0 and disallowed the motion,\u00a0 leaving\u00a0 the complaint and the injunction standing, in proof of which the plaintiffs attach a certified\u00a0 copy by the clerk of the Court of First Instance of the city of\u00a0 Manila of all the proceedings\u00a0 in said case, except the summons\u00a0 and notifications,\u00a0 marking said copy 'Exhibit A' of this complaint.\u00a0 (See below.)<br\/><br\/>\"IX. The Court of First Instance, according to the facts related in the complaint, lacks jurisdiction in the matter, since the power to deport foreign subjects of the Chinese Empire\u00a0 is a privative one of the Governor-General of these Islands, and the\u00a0 defendant A, S. Crossfield exceeded\u00a0 his authority by trying the case and issuing the injunction and refusing to allow the demurrer and motion for the dismissal of the complaint and the dissolution of the injunction.<br\/><br\/>\"Therefore, the\u00a0 plaintiffs pray the court:<br\/><br\/>\"(<i>a<\/i>)\u00a0 That an injunction immediately issue against the defendant A. S. Crossfield ordering him to discontinue the trial of said cause until further orders from this court;<br\/><br\/>\"(<i>b<\/i>)\u00a0 That the defendants being summoned in accordance with law, a prohibitive order issue against the said defendant A. S. Crossfield, restraining him from assuming jurisdiction in said case and ordering him to dismiss the same and cease from the trial thereof;<br\/><br\/>\"(<i>c<\/i>)\u00a0 Finally, that the plaintiffs be granted such other and further relief\u00a0 to which they may be entitled according to the facts, and that they may be allowed the costs of the trial.<br\/><br\/>\"Manila, July 9, 1910.<br\/><div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\"IGNACIO VlLLAMOR,<br\/><\/div><div style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"><i>\"Attorney-General<\/i><br\/><\/div><br\/><div style=\"margin-left: 200px; text-align: right;\">\u00a0\u00a0 \"W.

On the 24th day of May, 1910, the Hon. Grant Trent, Associate Justice, acting in vacation, issued\u00a0 the preliminary injunction prayed for.<br\/><br\/>On the 2d day of\u00a0 June, 1910, the attorneys\u00a0 for the defendants (herein), Messrs. O'Brien &amp; DeWitt, and Hartford Beaumont, filed:<br\/><br\/>(1)\u00a0 A demurrer to the petition; and<br\/><br\/>(2)\u00a0 A motion to dissolve said injunction, each based upon the general ground that the facts alleged in the petition were insufficient to constitute a cause of action.<br\/><br\/>The said\u00a0 \"demurrer\"\u00a0 and \"motion to dissolve\"\u00a0 were brought on\u00a0 for hearing before the Supreme Court on the 11th day of\u00a0 July, 1910, and the questions presented\u00a0 were argued at length by the attorneys for the respective parties.<br\/><br\/>One of the questions which is\u00a0 presented by the pleadings and by the arguments presented in the cause is whether or not the action pending in the lower court is an action against the Governor-General, as such, as well as against the other defendants in their official capacity.\u00a0\u00a0 If it should be decided that the action is one against the defendants in their official capacity, then the question\u00a0 will be presented for\u00a0 decision whether or not the courts have\u00a0 jurisdiction over the Governor-General, <i>for the purpose of reviewing his action in any case <\/i>and with especial reference to the facts presented.<br\/><br\/>The pleadings presented in this court affirmatively allege that the action in the lower court was against the defendants (plaintiffs herein) in their official capacity.\u00a0 The pleadings here also allege positively that the acts complained of in the lower court were done by the defendants in their official capacity;\u00a0 that\u00a0 the expulsion\u00a0 of the\u00a0 defendant (plaintiff below) was in the public interest of the Government, at the request of the consul-general of the Imperial Government of China; that the said plaintiffs J. E. Harding and C. R. Trowbridge acted\u00a0 under the orders of the plaintiff W. Cameron Forbes; that W. Cameron Forbes acted in his official\u00a0 capacity as Governor-General, the act being an act of the Government itself, which action was immediately\u00a0 reported to\u00a0 the Secretary of War.<br\/><br\/>The pleadings in the lower court simply described the defendants (plaintiffs herein) as W.\u00a0 Cameron Forbes,\u00a0 Governor-General ; J. E. Harding, chief of police of the city of Manila, and C. R. Trowbridge, chief of the secret service of the city of Manila.\u00a0 The lower court held that:<br\/><blockquote>\"The allegations of the second paragraph of the complaint, to the effect that W. Cameron Forbes is\u00a0 the Governor-General of the Philippine Islands, that\u00a0 Charles R. Trowbridge is the chief of the secret service of Manila, and that J.\u00a0 E. Harding is the\u00a0 chief of police\u00a0 of\u00a0 Manila, are\u00a0 descriptive only, and there\u00a0 is no allegation in\u00a0 the complaint\u00a0 that any of the defendants\u00a0 (plaintiffs herein) performed the acts complained of in his official capacity.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The theory of the lower court evidently was that the defendants should\u00a0 have been described, for example, \"W. Cameron Forbes, as Governor-General,\" etc.\u00a0 In this\u00a0 theory the lower court\u00a0 has much authority in its support\u00a0\u00a0 However, this failure of correct and technical description of the parties is an objection which the parties themselves should present,\u00a0 but when\u00a0 all\u00a0 the parties treat\u00a0 the\u00a0 action\u00a0 as one based\u00a0 upon a particular theory, that theory should be accepted.\u00a0 Upon this question the lower court,\u00a0 in his order, said:<br\/><blockquote>\"Counsel\u00a0 for\u00a0 both parties made\u00a0 exhaustive arguments, both apparently\u00a0 considering the primal issue to be whether the defendant, W. Cameron Forbes, had authority at Jaw, as <i>Governor-General of the Philippine\u00a0 Islands,<\/i> to\u00a0 deport plaintiff, as alleged in the complaint and whether the court had jurisdiction\u00a0 to restrain him from making such deportation.\"<\/blockquote>It will be noted also that the prayer of the complaint\u00a0 in the lower court\u00a0 asked for relief against\u00a0 ''his successors\u00a0 in office.\"\u00a0 The injunction also ran against \"his successors\u00a0 in office.\"\u00a0 Thus clearly it appears that the\u00a0 action was against the defendants in their official\u00a0 capacity.<br\/><br\/>In this court there was no pretension by the attorney for the defendant (plaintiff below)\u00a0 that the action\u00a0 was not against the Governor-General <i>as Governor-General<\/i>, and the others as well, in their official capacity.\u00a0\u00a0 In fact,\u00a0 when an inquiry was made of the attorney for the defense concerning his theory, his reply was simply that the acts of the Governor-General,\u00a0 being illegal, were not\u00a0 performed in his official capacity.<br\/><br\/>The argument of the attorney for the defendant was directed to the proposition\u00a0 that the Governor-General, in deporting or expelling the said\u00a0 Chinamen, did not act in accordance with that provision of the Philippine Bill (sec. 5, Act of Congress, July 1,1902), which provides that:<br\/><blockquote>\"No law shall be enacted\u00a0 in said Islands which shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process\u00a0 of law; or deny to\u00a0 any person therein equal protection of the laws.\"<\/blockquote>The attorney for the plaintiffs,\u00a0 in answering this argument, maintained:<br\/><br\/>First. That the act of the Governor-General was the act of the Philippine Government and that he had a right, inherent in him as the representative of the Government and acting for the Government,\u00a0 to deport or expel the defendant; and<br\/><br\/>Second. In the absence of express rules and regulations for carrying such power into operation, he (the Governor- General) had a right to use his own official judgment and discretion in the exercise of\u00a0 such power.<br\/><br\/>In order to arrive at a correct solution of the questions presented by the foregoing facts, we shall discuss the following propositions:<br\/><center><br\/>I.<br\/><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><blockquote>WHAT ARE THE POWERS OF THE PHILIPPINE GOVERNMENT TO DEPORT OR EXPEL OBJECTIONABLE ALIENS?<\/blockquote><\/div><\/center>The Government of the United\u00a0 States in\u00a0 the Philippine Islands is a government with such delegated, implied, inherent, and necessary military,\u00a0 civil, political, and police powers as are necessary to maintain itself, subject to such restrictions\u00a0 and limitations as\u00a0 the people of the\u00a0 United States, acting through Congress and the'President, may deem advisable, from time to time, to interpose.\u00a0\u00a0 (Instructions of President McKinley to\u00a0 the Taft Commission; executive order of President McKinley dated June 21, 1901, appointing Mr. Taft\u00a0 Civil Governor of\u00a0 the Philippine Islands ; that part of the Act of Congress\u00a0 of March 2, 1901, known as the Spooner Amendment; Barcelon <i>vs.<\/i> Baker, 5 Phil, Rep., 87; U.\u00a0 S.<i> vs<\/i>. Bull, 15 Phil.\u00a0 Rep., 7, 8 Off.\u00a0 Gaz., 271.)<br\/><br\/>The Spooner Amendment provided that -<br\/><blockquote>\"All military, civil, and judicial powers necessary to govern the Philippine Islands *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 shall, until otherwise provided by\u00a0 Congress, be vested in such person and persons,\u00a0 and shall be exercised in such\u00a0 manner, as the President of the United States shall direct, for the establishment of civil government and for maintaining and protecting the inhabitants of said Islands in the free enjoyment of their liberty, property, and religion.\"<\/blockquote>By this Act of\u00a0 Congress a system\u00a0 of government was established in the\u00a0 Philippine Islands which carried with it the right and duty on the\u00a0 part\u00a0 of\u00a0 such government to perform all acts that might be necessary or expedient for the security, safety, and welfare of the people of the Islands.<br\/><br\/>In the case of United States <i>vs. <\/i>Bull, this court, speaking through Mr. Justice Elliott, said:<br\/><blockquote>\"Within the limits of its\u00a0 authority the Government of the Philippine Islands is a complete governmental organism, with\u00a0 executive,\u00a0 legislative, and judicial departments exercising the functions commonly assigned to such\u00a0 departments.\u00a0 The separation of powers is as complete as in most governments.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Having reached the conclusion that the Government of the United States in the Philippine Islands is a government with all the necessary powers of a government, subject to certain control in the exercise thereof, <i>we are of the opinion, and so hold, that\u00a0 it\u00a0 has\u00a0 impliedly or inherently all such powers as are necessary\u00a0 to\u00a0 preserve\u00a0 itself in conformity with the will of the Congress of the United States and the President thereof,\u00a0 and to this end it may prevent\u00a0 the entrance\u00a0 into or eliminate from its borders all such aliens whose presence is found to be detrimental or injurious to its public\u00a0 interest,\u00a0 peace, and domestic tranquillity. <\/i> Every government having the dignity of a government possesses this power.\u00a0 Every author who has written upon the subject of international law and who has discussed this question has reached the same conclusion.\u00a0 Among these authors may be mentioned such noted men and statesmen as Vattel, Ortolan, Blackstone, Chitty, Phillimore,\u00a0 Puffendorf, Fiore, Martens, Lorimer,\u00a0 Torres, Castro, Bello, Heffter, Marshall, Cooley, Wharton, Story, Moore, Taylor,\u00a0 Oppenheim, Westlake, Holland,\u00a0 Scott, Haycroft, Craies, Pollock, Campbell, and others.<br\/><br\/>Not only have\u00a0 all noted authors upon this question of international law reached this conclusion, but all the courts before which this particular question has been involved have also held that every government has the inherent power to expel\u00a0 from its borders\u00a0 aliens whose\u00a0 presence has been found detrimental to the public interest.<br\/><br\/>This court, speaking through its\u00a0 Chief Justice, in\u00a0 the case of <i>In re<\/i> Patterson (1 Phil.

The\u00a0 mere absence\u00a0 of legislation regulating this inherent right to deport or expel\u00a0 aliens\u00a0 is not sufficient to prevent the chief executive head of the government, acting in his own sphere and in accordance with his official duty, to deport or expel objectionable aliens,\u00a0 when he deems\u00a0 such action\u00a0 necessary for\u00a0 the peace and\u00a0 domestic tranquillity of the nation.\u00a0\u00a0 One of the\u00a0 principal duties of the chief executive of a nation is to preserve peace and order within the territory.\u00a0 To do this he is possessed of certain\u00a0 powers. It is believed and asserted to be sound doctrine of political law that if in a particular case\u00a0 he finds that there are aliens within his territory whose\u00a0 continued\u00a0 presence\u00a0 is injurious to the public interest, he\u00a0 may, even in the\u00a0 absence of express law,\u00a0 deport them.\u00a0 The\u00a0 legislative department of the government is not always in session.\u00a0 It may require days\u00a0 and even months for that department\u00a0 to assemble. Sudden and unexpected conditions may arise, growing out of the presence of obnoxious and untrustworthy foreigners, which demand immediate action.\u00a0\u00a0 Their continued presence in the country may\u00a0 jeopardize even the very life of the government.\u00a0 To hold that, in view of the inherent power of the government, the chief executive authority was without power to expel such foreigners, would be to hold that at times, at\u00a0 least, the very existence\u00a0 and life of the\u00a0 government might be\u00a0 subjected\u00a0 to\u00a0 the will of\u00a0 designing\u00a0 and obnoxious foreigners,\u00a0 who were entirely\u00a0 out\u00a0 of sympathy with the existing government, and whose continued presence in the territory\u00a0 might be for the\u00a0 purpose of destroying such government.<br\/><br\/>Suppose,\u00a0 for example, that\u00a0 some of the inhabitants of the thickly\u00a0 populated countries situated\u00a0 near the\u00a0 Philippine\u00a0 Archipelago, should\u00a0 suddenly\u00a0 decide to enter\u00a0 the Philippine Islands and should,\u00a0 without warning appear in one of the remote harbors and at once land, for the purpose of\u00a0 stirring\u00a0 up the\u00a0 inhabitants and\u00a0 inciting dissensions against the present\u00a0 Government.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And\u00a0 suppose,\u00a0\u00a0 for example, that the Legislature was not in\u00a0 session; could\u00a0 it be\u00a0 denied that the\u00a0 Governor-General,\u00a0 under\u00a0 his\u00a0 general political powers to protect the very existence of the Government, has the power to take\u00a0 such steps\u00a0 as he may deem wise and necessary for the purpose of ridding the country of such obnoxious and dangerous foreigners?\u00a0 To admit such a doctrine would be to admit that every government was without the power to protect its own life,\u00a0 and at times might be\u00a0 subjected to the control\u00a0 of people who were out of sympathy with the spirit of\u00a0 the Government and who owe no allegiance whatever to it, and are under no obligations to assist in its perpetuity.<br\/><br\/>It has never been denied,\u00a0 in\u00a0 a government of separate and\u00a0 independent departments,\u00a0 executive, legislative, and judicial, that the legislature may prescribe the methods or conditions for the exercise\u00a0 of this power, but the mere absence of such rules neither proves that the power does not exist nor that the executive head of the government may not adopt for himself such\u00a0 methods as he may deem advisable for the public good and the public safety. <i> He can only be controlled in the conditions and methods as to when and how the powers shall be exercised.\u00a0\u00a0 The right itself can not be destroyed or bartered away. <\/i> When\u00a0 the\u00a0 power is once created and no rules are adopted for its enforcement,\u00a0 the person or authority who has to exercise such power has the right to adopt such sane methods for carrying the power into operation as prudence, good judgment and the exigencies of the case may demand; and whatever rules and regulations may be\u00a0 adopted by the person or\u00a0 department possessing this power for carrying into operation this inherent power of the government, whether they are\u00a0 prescribed\u00a0 or not, will constitute due process of\u00a0 law.\u00a0\u00a0 (See speech delivered by John Marshall in the House of\u00a0 Representatives of\u00a0 the United\u00a0 States, Annals of the Sixth Congress, 595; United States <i>vs.<\/i> Robins, Fed.

The words \"successors in office,\" as used\u00a0 in the complaint, refer only to the remedy by injunction\u00a0 and not to the damages prayed for by reason of the expulsion.\u00a0\u00a0 The action no less certainly\u00a0 is directed against the other\u00a0 defendants personally.<br\/><br\/>When the case was decided in this court upon\u00a0 the merits, Mr. Justice Trent and myself signed the following opinion:<br\/><blockquote>\"I concur in so much of the opinion of Mr. Justice Johnson as holds that the action in\u00a0 the Court of First Instance from\u00a0 which this controversy arises can not be maintained against the Governor-General.\u00a0 With the reasons given and the arguments advanced in that opinion for the\u00a0 support of that conclusion I\u00a0 disagree.\u00a0\u00a0 I can not assent to\u00a0 the theory upon\u00a0 which the opinion is\u00a0 framed nor to the reasons and arguments advanced in support thereof.\u00a0\u00a0 I understand that the action\u00a0 in the court below, as appears from the records of that court and the concession of all parties\u00a0 interested, is one\u00a0 against1 the Governor-General\u00a0 personally\u00a0 for acts which he assumed to perform in his official capacity.\u00a0\u00a0 That the Governor-General acted in the honest belief that he had the power to perform the\u00a0 acts complained\u00a0 of is\u00a0 nowhere questioned.\u00a0 This being so, whether or not he actually had such powers is, as I view this case, immaterial.\u00a0 I base my concurrence in\u00a0 the\u00a0 result solely upon the theory\u00a0 that the Governor-General, in\u00a0 his official capacity, being\u00a0 one of the coordinate branches\u00a0 of\u00a0 the Government\u00a0 (U.\u00a0 S.\u00a0 <i>vs<\/i>.

S., 335; Spalding <i>vs.<\/i> Vilas, 161\u00a0 U.

Indeed the reasons and arguments of the courts and text writers advanced to support the principle of nonliability of legislatures and courts apply with\u00a0 even\u00a0 greater force to the\u00a0 Executive.<br\/><br\/>\"The Governor-General, in determining whether or not he has the power or jurisdiction to perform a. certain act, should be\u00a0 protected against personal actions\u00a0 against him for damages as completely and effectively as he unquestionably is when, jurisdiction being conceded, he honestly acts in excess thereof.\u00a0\u00a0 There is no\u00a0 dissimilarity in the quality of the mental process employed or the\u00a0 judgment brought to bear and exercised in arriving at a conclusion in the two cases.<br\/><br\/>\"This\u00a0 theory does not in any way weaken the power of this court,\u00a0 in a proper action, to determine the legality of all official acts once performed and the\u00a0 legal consequences flowing therefrom.\u00a0 The necessity for such determination does not, however, arise in this case.\"<\/blockquote>To\u00a0 that opinion\u00a0 we still adhere.\u00a0\u00a0 A thorough reexamination of the questions\u00a0 involved and of the principles of law which, we believe, must be applied in\u00a0 their solution adds to our conviction that the conclusions\u00a0 therein reached\u00a0 are sound and\u00a0 should guide the court\u00a0 in the disposition of the case before it.\u00a0\u00a0 The principles enunciated in that opinion were\u00a0 not, however, presented or discussed by the attorneys, or either of them, in the extended\u00a0 and elaborate arguments which they made, both orally\u00a0 and\u00a0 in writing, to this court. A motion for a rehearing having been made and the objections\u00a0 and arguments of counsel having been\u00a0 particularly directed\u00a0 against the\u00a0 conclusions presented\u00a0 in our former opinion,\u00a0 we deem\u00a0 it advisable to\u00a0 present here, with some elaboration\u00a0 and detail, the reasons which impelled\u00a0 us to the conclusions reached therein.<br\/><br\/>In this opinion we discuss the subject, largely speaking, in two aspects.<br\/><br\/>First,\u00a0 the nature\u00a0 and\u00a0 quality of the functions exercised by the Governor-General in arriving at the conclusion that he had the\u00a0 right to expel Chuoco Tiaco.\u00a0\u00a0 Our conclusion upon this branch of the\u00a0 subject is that the act was in the nature of a\u00a0 judicial\u00a0 act,\u00a0 the functions exercised were judicial in their quality,\u00a0 and\u00a0 that he should have the same protection against civil liability in exercising this function that would be accorded to a court under similar circumstances.<br\/><br\/>Second, the fundamental nature\u00a0 and attributes of the office of Governor-General, and whether or not public policy requires\u00a0 that there be applied to him and his acts the same principles which govern the liability of the members of the Legislature and of the judiciary.\u00a0\u00a0 Our conclusion upon this branch of the case is that the Government here is one of three departments - executive, legislative, and judicial - that the office of Governor-General\u00a0 is one\u00a0 of\u00a0 the coordinate branches of the Government, and that the same public policy which relieves a member of the Legislature or a member of the judiciary from personal liability for their official acts also relieves the Governor-General in like cases.<br\/><br\/>It has been settled by previous decisions of this\u00a0 court that the\u00a0 Government established in\u00a0 the\u00a0 Philippine Islands is one of three departments - legislative, executive and judicial.\u00a0\u00a0 In the case of the\u00a0 U.

Obviously, therefore, the primal necessity laid upon\u00a0 him, when, in a given case, he believes himself called upon to act, is to determine whether there\u00a0 is a law under which he may act - whether, in other words, he is authorized to act in that particular case.\u00a0\u00a0 One occupying that high position owes a heavy obligation to the State.\u00a0\u00a0 A careful and conscientious man, intensely anxious to meet the full requirements\u00a0 of this obligation, will inevitably dedicate\u00a0 his first consideration to the determination of what\u00a0 that obligation\u00a0 is.\u00a0 From the viewpoint of the governors of the\u00a0 American\u00a0 States,\u00a0 this is not,\u00a0 generally speaking,\u00a0 a difficult question.\u00a0 There conditions are settled.\u00a0 Society is\u00a0 old.\u00a0\u00a0 Questions\u00a0 wholly\u00a0 new rarely arise.\u00a0 The constitutions confer the powers generally. The statutes specify them.\u00a0 The source of power is the constitution. The guide\u00a0 is the statutes.\u00a0 Both are\u00a0 written. They constitute the governor's textbook of power and procedure - specific, definite, certain.\u00a0\u00a0 In the Philippine Islands the situation is different.\u00a0 Here, while the\u00a0 sources\u00a0 of the Governor-General's power are known, the extent and character of the power drawn from those sources are not so clear. Many times they are extremely difficult of\u00a0 ascertainment. The Government here is a new one.\u00a0 Its establishment is a step in ways heretofore untrodden by the\u00a0 American Republic.\u00a0 Its history furnished no example, its law no precedent.\u00a0 Her statesmanship had, up to the moment, framed no model\u00a0 from which a colony government might be fashioned ; the philosophy of her institutions presents no theories along which action may unhesitatingly proceed.\u00a0 There is no experience to guide the\u00a0 feet; no\u00a0 settled principles of colonial government and administration to which men may turn to justify their action or dissipate their doubts.\u00a0 Therefore,\u00a0 when, seeing, as he believed,\u00a0 certain\u00a0 Chinese aliens outraging the public\u00a0 conscience and seriously threatening public security, the Governor-General, believing that the only procedure adequate to protect the public interests was the expulsion\u00a0 of the offenders, began an investigation to determine whether or not he had the power of expulsion, he was confronted with a question of very serious intricacy and\u00a0 doubt.\u00a0 It was of the very greatest importance\u00a0 also. It is undoubted that he was thoroughly convinced that he was\u00a0 required, by the obligation of his office, to act if the law authorized it.\u00a0 He knew the strength\u00a0 and the justice of the proposition that a public official may not sit supinely by and see outraged the very things that he is bound\u00a0 by his oath to protect without exhausting every atom of his power and every resource of his office in an\u00a0 attempt to meet the situation as it ought to be met.\u00a0 His primal duty, under such circumstances, would be to determine what were his powers. The situation would imperatively demand that he ascertain what he could do. This involves, as already said, a determination upon which even a court, learned in the law and experienced in its construction, would enter with hesitation and misgivings.\u00a0 The\u00a0 question to be resolved is so\u00a0 manysided, its relations so\u00a0 intricate and numerous, the result of its determination so\u00a0 far-reaching,\u00a0 politically as well\u00a0 as legally, as to\u00a0 require\u00a0 the most careful consideration, the must exhaustive forethought.\u00a0 It involves not only the discussion and resolution of judicial as well as administrative questions\u00a0 of the\u00a0 most\u00a0 highly\u00a0 important kind, but\u00a0 also whether this Government has any power of expulsion whatever.<br\/><br\/>He has, then, as his initiatory\u00a0 resolution, to determine whether the Government of the Philippine Islands has the power of expulsion at all.\u00a0\u00a0 As a condition precedent to the decision of that question he must adjudge (a) whether the Government here is in any sense a\u00a0 sovereign government; for the power to expel a domiciled foreigner is distinctively an attribute of sovereignty, to be exercised, under the uniform practice\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 Government of\u00a0 the\u00a0 United States, only in exceptional cases and then under recognized methods\u00a0 of\u00a0 procedure.\u00a0 If he resolve that question in the negative, he must then decide (b)\u00a0 whether the Government of the United States has\u00a0 conferred upon the Government here those powers\u00a0 of sovereignty necessary to authorize such act.<br\/><br\/>It is needless to say that the very gravest questions are involved\u00a0 in\u00a0 these\u00a0 determinations.\u00a0 I do\u00a0 not stop to enumerate them or to present the serious difficulties which must be met in making them.\u00a0 It suffices to say that, when he has fully resolved those questions, he\u00a0 is\u00a0 then only on the threshold of his inquiry.\u00a0 Inasmuch as it might appear to one investigating\u00a0 the subject for the first time that the power of expulsion might be an inherent attribute of the Executive, as in some countries it\u00a0 is alleged to be, he must determine,\u00a0 first, the fundamental\u00a0 nature of his executive powers.\u00a0 He must decide\u00a0 whether, under the form of the government of which\u00a0 his office is the executive part, the power of expulsion belongs to the executive exclusively, or solely to the legislative, or whether it belongs to both, in combination with the judicial.\u00a0\u00a0 This requires that he distinguish his executive functions from those which are legislative, upon the one hand, and those which are judicial, upon the other - a determination most difficult in many instances, not only by reason of the considerations above set forth, but also for the reason that, while the\u00a0 broad distinction is clear,\u00a0 nevertheless, frequently, the nature of one verges so closely upon that of the other\u00a0 as to render the difference between them subtle, uncertain,\u00a0 and elusive.<br\/><br\/>He must, second, judge whether that power, whatever it is and whatever its extent,\u00a0 came untrammeled to the Military Governor from the hands of the President, or whether he received it modified and\u00a0 restricted.\u00a0 This determination is necessary for the reason already pointed out that the Governor-General has only such executive power as had the Military Governor.\u00a0 This involves an interpretation of the order\u00a0 of the President above quoted - a very real judicial construction of its legal signification.<br\/><br\/>He\u00a0 must decide, third, whether the acts or orders\u00a0 by which executive power was given to the Military Governor and those by which that power was transferred to\u00a0 him do or do riot, by their very terms, define that power\u00a0 itself,\u00a0 its character and extent, or specify with more or less\u00a0 certainty the acts which he may perform under it.\u00a0 This again brings into play functions which approach the judicial so closely as to render them practically indistinguishable.<br\/><br\/>After all these investigations,\u00a0 interpretations,\u00a0 and constructions have been\u00a0 completed, there still remains to the Governor-General for\u00a0 solution\u00a0 one\u00a0 of\u00a0 the most\u00a0 difficult problems of all\u00a0 that\u00a0 of determining whether\u00a0 or not,\u00a0 irrespective of the foregoing considerations, there\u00a0 exists in force and\u00a0 vigor,\u00a0 under the American regime, a law of Spanish origin\u00a0 with\u00a0 which\u00a0 he may adequately meet\u00a0 the situation that\u00a0 faces him.\u00a0 As we have already seen,\u00a0 the instructions of the President of the United States to General Merritt, dated\u00a0 May 19, 1898, provide that - <br\/><blockquote>\"The municipal laws of the conquered territory, such\u00a0 as affect private\u00a0 rights of person and\u00a0 property, and provide for the punishment of crime, are considered as continuing in force, so far as they are\u00a0 compatible with the new order of things, until they\u00a0 are suspended or superseded\u00a0 by the occupying belligerent; and in practice they are not usually abrogated, but are allowed to remain in force,\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\"<\/blockquote>We\u00a0 have also seen\u00a0 that\u00a0 the proclamation\u00a0 of General Merritt on the capitulation of the Spanish forces in Manila also provides that -<br\/><blockquote>\"The municipal\u00a0 laws such\u00a0 as affect private rights\u00a0 of persons and property, regulate local institutions, and provide for the\u00a0 punishment of crime\u00a0 shall be considered\u00a0 as continuing in force, so far as compatible with the purposes of\u00a0 military\u00a0 government, and\u00a0 that\u00a0 they be\u00a0 administered through the ordinary tribunals substantially as\u00a0 before occupation,\u00a0 but by officials appointed\u00a0 by the\u00a0 government\u00a0 of occupation.\"<\/blockquote>It is evident that the character and contents of these two instruments necessitate that the Governor-General consider and decide\u00a0 when the laws and institutions of the United States are so incompatible with those of Spain in the Philippine Islands as to\u00a0 render the latter\u00a0 inoperative.\u00a0 This involves the consideration of the broad question of\u00a0 when the laws,\u00a0 customs, and\u00a0 institutions of a conquering nation are so incompatible with those of the conquered as to render them inoperative and ineffective by the mere change\u00a0 of sovereignty.\u00a0 This\u00a0 is\u00a0 a theme upon\u00a0 which writers have differed and\u00a0 concerning which the\u00a0 courts\u00a0 have not been free from uncertainties and even contradictions.\u00a0 The field opened by this necessity is so\u00a0 wide, the subject-matter\u00a0 so uncertain\u00a0 and elusive, and the principles involved so dependent for their application upon\u00a0 the personal equation of the one\u00a0 dealing with the subject that it\u00a0 is\u00a0 extremely easy for two men, equally honest and able, to differ widely on a result.\u00a0\u00a0 Much\u00a0 depends upon the atmosphere in which one is placed and the point of view from which the subject is seen.\u00a0 The Supreme Court of the United States has just held unconstitutional and void\u00a0 the\u00a0 law relating\u00a0 to the falsification\u00a0 of an official document\u00a0 by a public\u00a0 official, a law of Spanish origin, which had generally been\u00a0 supposed, and had repeatedly\u00a0 been held by the\u00a0 Supreme Court of the Islands, to have survived the change of\u00a0 sovereignty.\u00a0 The great body of our laws is of Spanish origin and comes\u00a0 to us and is enforced by us upon the theory that it has survived. As a result, this court is continually called upon\u00a0 to\u00a0 adjudicate the question whether a given Spanish\u00a0 law\u00a0 is still in existence.\u00a0 Parties are unceasingly asserting rights of property and of person based upon such laws.\u00a0\u00a0 These assertions are as\u00a0 frequently denied.\u00a0\u00a0 It\u00a0 is a\u00a0 subject over which the best judgments differ and a question\u00a0 over which uncertainty\u00a0 continually holds sway.\u00a0 It was a question, however, which had to be met and solved by the Governor-General.\u00a0 It could\u00a0 not be\u00a0 avoided.\u00a0 It\u00a0 confronted\u00a0 him squarely\u00a0 and insistently, because a\u00a0 condition\u00a0 and not a theory was thrust in his face.\u00a0 It appears that, prior to the conquest and occupation of the Islands by the Americans, there was in force here a royal decree giving the Spanish Governor-General power, when certain conditions conjoined, to expel domiciled foreigners.\u00a0\u00a0 That decree reads:<br\/><center><br\/>\"OFFICE OF THE\u00a0 COLONIAL\u00a0 SECRETARY.<br\/><\/center> <br\/><div style=\"margin-left: 440px;\">\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"No.\u00a0 607.<br\/><\/div><blockquote>\"EXCELLENCY:\u00a0 In\u00a0 view of the proceedings\u00a0 relative\u00a0 to the consultation had\u00a0 by the Audiencia de Manila with\u00a0 the government, through the supreme court, the latter having rendered\u00a0 a report on\u00a0 the\u00a0 subject-matter thereof,\u00a0 which refers to deportations, the case was forwarded for report to the political division of this office, and His Majesty the King (whom may God preserve),\u00a0 and in\u00a0 his\u00a0 name\u00a0 the\u00a0 Queen Regent, passing upon the report, has been pleased to decide that:<br\/><br\/>\"1.

The right of appeal to the audiencias, granted\u00a0 by royal order of May 25,\u00a0 1847, from the action taken by the Governor-General, was abolished by the decree of November 28 of the same year, which provides in article 7 that orders issued by the Governor-General\u00a0 in matters pertaining to government\u00a0 or to\u00a0 the\u00a0 exercise\u00a0 of his discretional\u00a0 powers, can only be revoked by the Supreme Government.<br\/><br\/>\"The\u00a0 foregoing by this royal order is communicated to you\u00a0 for\u00a0 your information and the consequent effects. - May God\u00a0 preserve Your Excellency many years. - Madrid, August 2, 1888.\u00a0\u00a0 (Signed)\u00a0 Ruiz y Capdepon.<br\/><br\/>\"To the Governor-General of the Philippine\u00a0 Islands:<br\/><br\/>\"Comply with and observe the above royal order and issue to the\u00a0 provincial chiefs\u00a0 the necessary orders thereunto pertaining. - (Signed) Weyler.\"<\/blockquote>The question was thus squarely up.\u00a0 Did that law survive the American occupation ?\u00a0 An answer must be given by the Governor-General, if\u00a0 he believed his duty\u00a0 to the State required him to act if he had the power.\u00a0 Once more he must interpret, construe, and determine; and in doing so he must tread legal mazes as intricate and bewildering as ever were trodden by a judge at court.<br\/><br\/>Having so far\u00a0 considered the processes\u00a0 which the mind of the Governor-General must pass through and the determinations which he must\u00a0 make in arriving at a conclusion as to whether he may or may not act in the case given, it is now necessary\u00a0 to inquire what is the nature of those processes and determinations.\u00a0 Evidently they involve\u00a0 the element of discretion of judgment as a result of investigation - a conclusion as to the existence of a law, an authority, a power,\u00a0 which lies at the very doorway of his activities. His judgment operates in a field over which he has general and\u00a0 exclusive jurisdiction and embraces a subject concerning which he must judge alone.\u00a0 It includes also a determination as to\u00a0 the character, quality, and extent of\u00a0 his own power and the\u00a0 rights and obligations of the person against or in reference to whom that power is\u00a0 to\u00a0 operate.\u00a0\u00a0 Every act of enforcement of whatever law, real or imaginary, must necessarily and inevitably be preceded\u00a0 by two determinations.\u00a0 First, is there a law at all;\u00a0 and, second, if there is, what is the meaning of it; what is its interpretation ? These determinations must always be made.\u00a0 They were laid upon the Governor-General by the very nature of his functions -\u00a0 an executor of\u00a0 the law. It is evident, therefore, in\u00a0 view of these considerations, that such functions involve much that is judicial.\u00a0 The executive and judicial functions here merge and\u00a0 overlap each other to\u00a0 a conspicuous extent; and it becomes at once apparent that the functions exercised by the Governor-General in reaching a conclusion to act in a given case,\u00a0 and especially in\u00a0 the case before us, were,\u00a0 in their nature, essentially judicial.\u00a0 If a judge had done the things which the Governor-General did in arriving at this conclusion, his\u00a0 act and determination\u00a0 would unquestionably have been judicial.\u00a0 Are they any the less so, in their essential nature, because a Governor-General and not a judge was the actor?\u00a0 The methods pursued by the two, Governor-General and judge, are not at all different.\u00a0 The subject-matter is precisely the\u00a0 same.\u00a0 The mental\u00a0 processes\u00a0 involved\u00a0 are identical.\u00a0 The discretion used\u00a0 is the\u00a0 same.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 objects in view are wholly similar the\u00a0 application of a public\u00a0 law to personal misconduct; the protection of the public against the malicious activities of a corrupt individual.<br\/><br\/>It now becomes necessary to\u00a0 determine what would be the\u00a0 civil\u00a0 responsibility\u00a0 of a judge\u00a0 acting upon the same questions and making the same\u00a0 determinations involved in the activities of the Governor-General complained of in this suit.\u00a0\u00a0 The reason for this necessity is found in the analogy which I propose\u00a0 to assert between\u00a0 the civil\u00a0 liability of a judge\u00a0 performing judicial functions and of the Governor-General\u00a0 exercising essentially\u00a0 the same attributes.\u00a0 The result\u00a0 of\u00a0 that\u00a0 analogy is\u00a0 that if a judge, performing\u00a0 the acts complained\u00a0 of,\u00a0 would not\u00a0 be\u00a0 civilly\u00a0 liable, then\u00a0 the Governor-General is not.<br\/><br\/>I, therefore, proceed to discuss\u00a0 the civil liability of judges. I deal\u00a0 with it in three aspects: First, where the judge acts within the limits of his jurisdiction; second, where\u00a0 he acts wholly without jurisdiction, and, third, where he\u00a0 acts in \"excess of jurisdiction.\"\u00a0 This discussion of the subject in such threefold aspect is rendered\u00a0 necessary by reason of the claim made in this case that the Governor-General, in whatever he did or\u00a0 brought about in\u00a0 the expulsion of the complainant and his companions, was wholly without authority, power, or jurisdiction and for that\u00a0 reason he\u00a0 is civilly\u00a0 responsible for whatever damages such illegal acts may have caused.<br\/><br\/>My position\u00a0 in\u00a0 the discussion\u00a0 of the question\u00a0 is\u00a0 that a judge may, in reality, act wholly without power, authority, or jurisdiction and still not be civilly liable; that jurisdiction ought not to be, and can not be, a vital - a controlling element in determining his liability; and that, if the question resolved by the judge be one whose determination required the exercise of the judicial functions, he is not civilly liable for damages caused\u00a0 by an act performed in pursuance of such\u00a0 determination\u00a0 even\u00a0 though\u00a0 he\u00a0 acts wholly without jurisdiction.\u00a0\u00a0 I further contend that the doctrine making jurisdiction the test of liability is illogical and unsound, and that the doctrine of excess of jurisdiction, carried to its logical\u00a0 conclusion,\u00a0 is a complete refutation\u00a0 of\u00a0 the original theory.<br\/><br\/>It is the universal statement of text writers that \"no person is liable civilly for what he may do as judge while acting within the limits of his jurisdiction.\"\u00a0 This is also a\u00a0 settled principle of law as applied by the courts.\u00a0 This doctrine is so thoroughly established\u00a0 that\u00a0 no authority need be cited to sustain it.\u00a0\u00a0 It is also universally asserted by text writers, and maintained by many courts, that jurisdiction is the sole and exclusive test of judicial liability, and it is\u00a0 affirmed that a judge is always civilly liable if he act without jurisdiction. Mr. Cooley in his work on Torts (2d ed., p. 486) says:<br\/><blockquote>\"Every judicial officer, whether the grade be high or low, must take care,\u00a0 before acting,\u00a0 to inform himself whether the circumstances justify his exercise of the judicial function.\u00a0 A judge is not such\u00a0 at all times and for all purposes; when he acts he must be clothed with jurisdiction; and acting without this, he\u00a0 is but the individual\u00a0 falsely assuming an authority he does not possess.\u00a0\u00a0 The officer is judge in the cases in which the law has empowered him to act, and\u00a0 in respect to\u00a0 persons lawfully brought before him; but he is not judge when he assumes to decide cases of a class which the law withholds from his cognizance,\u00a0 or cases between persons who are not, either actually or constructively,\u00a0 before him for the purpose.\u00a0\u00a0 Neither is he exercising the judicial function when, being empowered to enter one\u00a0 judgment or make one order, he enters\u00a0 or makes one wholly different in nature.\u00a0\u00a0 When he does this he steps over the\u00a0 boundary of his judicial authority, and is as much out of the protection of the law in respect to the particular act as if he held no office at all.\u00a0 This is a general rule.\"<\/blockquote>This same rule, it is\u00a0 alleged, is laid\u00a0 down by\u00a0 many authorities, among them being:\u00a0 Marshalsea case (10 Coke, 68b; 2 Adol. &amp; E.\u00a0 (N.

Its application did not work justice.\u00a0 It was found imperfect and\u00a0 inadequate.\u00a0\u00a0 It was seen\u00a0 to be lame and halt.\u00a0 It condemned in one case\u00a0 and\u00a0 relieved in another when\u00a0 there existed no real distinction between them, either in logic or justice.\u00a0 While this\u00a0 was\u00a0 not\u00a0 admitted, perhaps, in words by\u00a0 the courts, it was, nevertheless,\u00a0 seen and felt.\u00a0 Accordingly,\u00a0 laboring under the pressure of\u00a0 these conditions and\u00a0 to avoid the\u00a0 anomalous\u00a0 results flowing from a rigid application of the theory, they\u00a0 announced the\u00a0 doctrine of \"excess of jurisdiction.\"<br\/><br\/>This doctrine holds \"that judges of superior and general jurisdiction are not liable\u00a0 to civil actions for their judicial acts even when such acts are in excess of their jurisdiction.\" (Ross <i>vs.<\/i>\u00a0 Griffin, 53\u00a0 Mich., 5; Grove <i>vs<\/i>.

This inference\u00a0 is\u00a0 the inevitable\u00a0 one because the judge is entirely exempt if he act within <i>his jurisdiction<\/i>, and he is wholly immune if he act\u00a0 in <i>excess of jurisdiction; <\/i>but if he act <i>without jurisdiction,<\/i> he is fully liable.<br\/><br\/>I confess my inability to see how two conditions so different in their nature and characteristics as acting with jurisdiction and acting in excess of jurisdiction can be held to produce the same\u00a0 result - having in\u00a0 mind always the proposition universally asserted\u00a0 by the courts to\u00a0 be the basis of that difference in liability, that the nature of the judge's\u00a0 act, i. e., whether it makes him civilly liable or not, depends entirely on jurisdiction.\u00a0 That jurisdiction and excess of jurisdiction are conceptions wholly different is perfectly evident from the standpoint of language alone.\u00a0\u00a0 That their legal nature is entirely different will appear when we discuss want of jurisdiction\u00a0 and compare it with excess of jurisdiction.<br\/><br\/>If \"excess of jurisdiction\"\u00a0 means anything different from \"want of jurisdiction\" under the doctrine of excess of jurisdiction as it is asserted,\u00a0 it lies not at all in the\u00a0 essential nature of those conditions but, rather, in the accidental circumstance stated in the decisions, that the court, having once acquired jurisdiction of the subject-matter and the parties, any act of his\u00a0 during the proceedings which is beyond or outside\u00a0 of his\u00a0 real\u00a0 powers\u00a0 is in \"excess\"\u00a0 of jurisdiction merely, and\u00a0 has a different quality\u00a0 from\u00a0 that\u00a0 which the same act would have if there had been no jurisdiction in the first instance.\u00a0 In\u00a0 other\u00a0 words, jurisdiction having once been present in the cause, it continues to shed its beneficent influence over the court and his acts, no matter where he goes or what he does.\u00a0 This is the distinctive feature of the doctrine of\u00a0 excess\u00a0 of\u00a0 jurisdiction\u00a0 as that\u00a0 doctrine is laid down.\u00a0\u00a0 Jurisdiction once present is,\u00a0 under that\u00a0 doctrine, the touchstone of non-liability.\u00a0 As a necessary consequence, the court who\u00a0 lacks this protective genius\u00a0 of jurisdiction may lose his fortune and perhaps his liberty, although he may perform exactly\u00a0 the\u00a0 same acts as he\u00a0 who\u00a0 is wholly excused because\u00a0 he exceeds his jurisdiction.\u00a0\u00a0 It becomes necessary to inquire, therefore, in what way\u00a0 excess of jurisdiction\u00a0 differs\u00a0 essentially from lack of jurisdiction, for, if they produce\u00a0 results so\u00a0 violently in\u00a0 opposition,\u00a0 there must be a wide and essential difference between them - a difference wholly unlike that set forth in the decisions.<br\/><br\/>And first, as to excess of jurisdiction:<br\/><br\/>To exceed jurisdiction\u00a0 is to go outside\u00a0 of\u00a0 it; to pass beyond its limits.\u00a0 To exceed is \"to go beyond; to go too far; to pass the proper bounds or measure.\"\u00a0 \"Forty stripes he may give him\u00a0 and not <i>exceed.<\/i>\"\u00a0 Excess is \"the state of going beyond limits.\"\u00a0 Excess\u00a0 of jurisdiction is the state of being beyond, i. e., <i>outside the limits<\/i>,\u00a0 of jurisdiction. This is the only definition of excess of jurisdiction which the term will permit.\u00a0\u00a0 This is precisely the definition given in the very decisions which lay down the doctrine. One of the first cases in the United States to present the doctrine of excess of jurisdiction was that of Lange vs. Benedict (73 N. Y., 12).\u00a0\u00a0 In that\u00a0 case it appeared that the defendant presided as judge at a regular session of the United States Circuit Court, before which plaintiff was tried and convicted of a statutory offense\u00a0 punishable by a fine or imprisonment. He was sentenced by\u00a0 the defendant to pay a fine and to be imprisoned.\u00a0 Plaintiff paid the amount of the fine to the clerk of the court, who paid it into the United States Treasury.\u00a0 The plaintiff was also imprisoned.\u00a0 A writ of habeas corpus was granted by and returned into said\u00a0 court during the same term, and, on such return, defendant, holding the court and as judge thereof, vacated and set aside the sentence,\u00a0 and resentenced the plaintiff to be imprisoned for the term of one year.\u00a0\u00a0 Under this sentence the plaintiff was imprisoned.\u00a0 Such proceedings were subsequently had that the Supreme Court of the United States (Ex parte Lange, 18 Wall.,\u00a0 163, 176) adjudged the\u00a0 resentence to have been <i>without authority and void.<\/i>\u00a0 In deciding the case on the proceedings mentioned the Supreme Court of the United States said (<i>Ex parte<\/i> Lange, <i>supra<\/i>):<br\/><blockquote>\"We are of opinion that when\u00a0 the prisoner, as in this case, by reason of a valid judgment, had fully suffered one of the\u00a0 alternative punishments to which\u00a0 alone the law subjected\u00a0 him,\u00a0 the power of the\u00a0 court to punish farther was gone.\u00a0 That the principle we have discussed then interposed its\u00a0 shield, and forbid that he should\u00a0 be punished again for\u00a0 that offense.\u00a0 The\u00a0 record of the court's proceedings,\u00a0 at the\u00a0 moment the second\u00a0 sentence\u00a0 was\u00a0 rendered, showed that\u00a0 in that very case, and for that very offense, the prisoner\u00a0 had fully performed,\u00a0 completed, and endured one of the alternative punishments which the law prescribed for that offense, and had suffered\u00a0 five days' imprisonment on account of the other.\u00a0 It thus showed the court that\u00a0 its power\u00a0 to punish for that offense\u00a0 was at an end. Unless the whole doctrine of our system of jurisprudence, both of the Constitution and the common law, for the protection of personal\u00a0 rights in that regard, are a nullity, the authority of the court to punish the prisoner was gone.\u00a0 The power was exhausted; its\u00a0 further\u00a0 exercise was prohibited.\u00a0 It was error, but it was error because the power to render any further judgment did not exist.\"<\/blockquote>Commenting on\u00a0 this same\u00a0 case\u00a0 the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of <i>Ex parte<\/i>\u00a0 Parks (93 U. S., 23) said:<br\/><blockquote>\"But after the thorough\u00a0 investigation\u00a0 which\u00a0 has been given to\u00a0 this subject in previous cases, particularly those of<i> Ex parte<\/i>\u00a0 Yager (8 Wall., 85)\u00a0 and <i>Ex\u00a0 parte Lang<\/i>e (18 id.,\u00a0 163), it\u00a0 is\u00a0 unnecessary to\u00a0 pursue the subject further at this time.\u00a0 The last-mentioned case is confidently relied on as a precedent for allowing the writ in this case.\u00a0 But the two are totally unlike.\u00a0\u00a0 In Ex parte Lange we proceeded on the ground\u00a0 that, when the court\u00a0 rendered its second judgment, the\u00a0 case was entirely out of his hands.\u00a0 It was <i> functus officio <\/i>in regard to it.\u00a0\u00a0 The judgment first rendered had been\u00a0 executed and satisfied.\u00a0 The subsequent proceedings were, therefore, according to our view, void.\"<\/blockquote>In spite, however, of the\u00a0 fact that the Supreme\u00a0 Court of the United States had\u00a0 held\u00a0 that the act of the court in resentencing plaintiff was absolutely <i>without\u00a0 jurisdictio<\/i>n and<i> void, <\/i> nevertheless, the court of appeals of the State of New York,\u00a0 deciding the action against the\u00a0 judge\u00a0 for damages\u00a0 (Lange vs.\u00a0 Benedict, <i>supra<\/i>) after the rendition of the judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States on the question of the resentence, said, in giving a definition of the phrase\u00a0 \"excess of\u00a0 jurisdiction:\"\u00a0 \"The act\u00a0 of the defendant was then\u00a0 one in excess of or beyond the jurisdiction of the court.\" \"He had jurisdiction of\u00a0 the\u00a0 cause originally. That jurisdiction\u00a0 had\u00a0 ceased.\u00a0 His\u00a0 further acts were beyond or in .excess\u00a0 of his jurisdiction.\"\u00a0 \"If it be admitted\u00a0 that at\u00a0 the instant of the utterance of that order, jurisdiction ceased, as is claimed\u00a0 by the plaintiff, on the strength of the opinion in <i>Ex parte<\/i> Lange\u00a0 (<i>supra<\/i>),\u00a0 as commented upon in <i>Ex parte<\/i> Parks (93 U. S., 18), and that all subsequent to that was <i>coram non judice,<\/i> and void; still it was so, not that the court never had jurisdiction, but that the last act was in excess of jurisdiction.\"<br\/><br\/>If the intention of the New York court in that case was to use the phrase \"excess of jurisdiction\" in the sense that there was an <i>essential<\/i> and <i>vital<\/i> distinction between it and \"want of jurisdiction,\" a distinction so essential and vital as to warrant liability in the one\u00a0 case and nonliability in the other, I am\u00a0 in\u00a0 entire disagreement with its conclusion. If I were unsupported in my disagreement, I should hesitate long and doubt\u00a0 much before\u00a0 I differed with\u00a0 authority so eminent.\u00a0 But the\u00a0 Supreme Court\u00a0 of the United States, as shown by the quotation given, <i>has held in that very case<\/i> that the district court, in resentencing Lange, acted with complete and utter\u00a0 absence of jurisdiction.\u00a0\u00a0 I am in perfect accord with the use of the phrase\u00a0 \"excess of jurisdiction\" when it describes\u00a0 a particular legal condition which, in some of its colorings,\u00a0 some of its\u00a0 accidental or incidental features, is somewhat\u00a0 different\u00a0 from the\u00a0 legal\u00a0 condition \"absence of jurisdiction.\"\u00a0 But I am not in accord with its use if it is meant to describe something which is <i>essentially different in quality,<\/i> that\u00a0 is, <i>a different thing,<\/i> from excess of jurisdiction.\u00a0\u00a0 If the\u00a0 difference\u00a0 meant to\u00a0 be shown is, in its nature, the same difference which is indicated between two horses when it is\u00a0 said that one is black and\u00a0 the other bay, I agree.\u00a0 But if it is meant thereby to indicate that one is a horse and the other a cow, I disagree.\u00a0 The\u00a0 two legal conditions\u00a0 are essentially and really identical.\u00a0 Their coloring may be different but they are the same animal. The question\u00a0 before us\u00a0 is not whether there\u00a0 is such\u00a0 a difference in markings that the two conditions\u00a0 ought to be given different names as <i>a\u00a0 matter of convenience<\/i>, but, rather,\u00a0 is there\u00a0 a difference so important, so\u00a0 essential, so vital that we may establish upon that difference as an eternal foundation a just principle of law\u00a0 which\u00a0 wholly saves in the one case and utterly destroys\u00a0 in the other.\u00a0 The real and practical question for\u00a0 us is \"What does that difference amount to?\"\u00a0\u00a0 What\u00a0 results may it justly produce to the parties and to the court?\u00a0\u00a0 What results must it <i>necessarily<\/i> produce ?<br\/><br\/>In the case of Clarke <i>vs<\/i>. May (2 Gray, 410), a justice of the\u00a0 peace, having jurisdiction of the cause, summoned\u00a0 a person to\u00a0 appear before\u00a0 him\u00a0 as a witness therein.\u00a0 The person disobeyed.\u00a0\u00a0 The case was tried and ended.\u00a0\u00a0 Thereafter the justice issued process to punish for contempt the person who had disobeyed his <i>subpoena<\/i>.\u00a0\u00a0 He was arrested, fined, and not paying, was committed.\u00a0 It was held on appeal to the Supreme Court \"that the\u00a0 power and jurisdiction of magistrates in\u00a0 such cases was only incidental and auxiliary to the trial of the cause in which the witnesses were summoned; and could not be legally\u00a0 exercised, except\u00a0 during the pendency of such cause; that after its final disposition by a judgment,\u00a0 the authority to punish such contempt ceased, and that Clarke was therefore illegally committed. *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 Although\u00a0 he had jurisdiction\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 subject-matter, he was. empowered by\u00a0 law to exercise it only in\u00a0 a particular\u00a0 mode, and under certain\u00a0 limitations.\u00a0\u00a0 Having disregarded these\u00a0 limitations, and exercised his authority in a manner not sanctioned by law, he has been guilty of an excess\u00a0 of jurisdiction, which\u00a0 renders\u00a0 him liable as\u00a0 a trespasser\u00a0 to the injured\u00a0 party.\"<br\/><br\/>In the case of Gordon <i>vs.<\/i> Longest (16 Peters, 97), where the defendant took the proper steps, under a statute which required a\u00a0 State court under certain conditions to transmit the cause to the United States\u00a0 courts, to remove an action brought against him in the State court to the United States court, and,\u00a0 where the State court persisted,\u00a0 notwithstanding such steps, in trying the cause, the court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"This being clear in the language of the above act, it was the duty of the State court 'to proceed no further\u00a0 in the cause.'\u00a0 And every step consequently taken, in the exercise of a\u00a0 jurisdiction in the case, whether in the same court or in the Court of\u00a0 Appeals, was <i>coram non judice<\/i>.\"<\/blockquote>The case of Austin <i> vs.<\/i> Vrooman (128 N. Y., 229)\u00a0 is one very similar to\u00a0 the one last mentioned.\u00a0 There the defendant, a justice of the peace, caused the plaintiff to be arrested on a charge of supplying diluted milk to a butter factory. Plaintiff, on being\u00a0 arraigned, pleaded\u00a0 not guilty, waived preliminary examination and offered bail for his appearance before the\u00a0 next grand jury.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 offer was overruled by the defendant.\u00a0 He was tried, found guilty, and sentenced to pay a fine and to be imprisoned until paid, not to exceed ninety days.\u00a0 Pursuant to such sentence he was confined in the county jail.\u00a0 The statute making the act of plaintiff a crime provided that when a person charged with a violation of the Act should be brought before a justice of the peace, he\u00a0 should, have the\u00a0 right to elect\u00a0 to\u00a0 be tried by a jury after indictment, and on\u00a0 such election the justice could not proceed to try him but could\u00a0 only\u00a0 hold him to a court having authority to inquire, by\u00a0 intervention of\u00a0 a\u00a0 grand jury, into offenses triable\u00a0 in\u00a0 the county.\u00a0 In this\u00a0 case the court said, after referring to the case of Gordon <i>vs<\/i>. Longest (<i>supra<\/i>), in which it was held that, in a case very similar in\u00a0 principle to the\u00a0 one\u00a0 under consideration,\u00a0 any action taken by the State court after\u00a0 refusing to transmit the cause before it to the United States court was wholly void:<br\/><blockquote>\"Here, in the course of proceedings which he was forced to entertain, and in the case\u00a0 of one over whose person he has properly acquired jurisdiction, the justice is confronted with\u00a0 the necessity of deciding a question depending upon the construction to be given to a statute, and that\u00a0 question must be decided by him one way or\u00a0 the other before he can take another step in those proceedings which, up to that moment, have been legally and properly pending before him, and over which he has had full and complete jurisdiction. It seems plain\u00a0 that his decision upon the question is one in the course of a proper exercise of the jurisdiction first committed to him, and that his error in deciding that he had jurisdiction to\u00a0 proceed was an error of judgment upon a question\u00a0 of Jaw, and that he\u00a0 is, therefore, not responsible for such error in a civil action.\u00a0 It is unlike the case where a justice of the peace proceeded to try a civil action for assault\u00a0 and battery.\u00a0\u00a0 (Woodward <i>vs<\/i>.\u00a0 Paine, 15 John., 492). The justice never had in such case obtained jurisdiction over the subject-matter and he could not obtain it by deciding that he had it.\u00a0 The case falls under the principle of law that where a judge never has had jurisdiction over the subject-matter, he\u00a0 acts as a trespasser from the beginning in assuming it, and his decision that he has it is no protection to him.\u00a0 I know it was stated in Gordon\u00a0 <i>vs<\/i>. Longest (16 Peters, 97), in a\u00a0 case\u00a0 where the defendant took the proper steps to remove an action brought against him in the State court to the United States court and where the judge of the State court persisted, notwithstanding those steps, in trying the case,\u00a0 that every\u00a0 step subsequently taken\u00a0 by\u00a0 the State court in the exercise of jurisdiction was coram non judice. Yet in such a case the question is put whether\u00a0 the State judge would be liable for proceeding with the case\u00a0 in the honest exercise\u00a0 of his judgment.\"<\/blockquote>Being thus informed of the judicial meaning of the phrase \"excess of jurisdiction,\" it becomes necessary, second, to determine what is meant judicially by the expression \"lack of jurisdiction.\"\u00a0 An example\u00a0 frequently\u00a0 given by the\u00a0 courts to express what is meant by lack or failure of jurisdiction is that of a justice of the peace taking cognizance of and trying a civil action for assault and battery.\u00a0 Over such actions jurisdiction was never in any way conferred\u00a0 by\u00a0 law upon justices of the peace.\u00a0 In fact, the law expressly prohibits them from taking cognizance of such actions.\u00a0\u00a0 In such case, the\u00a0 justice never\u00a0 obtains jurisdiction\u00a0 over the\u00a0 subject matter.\u00a0\u00a0 He acts wholly\u00a0 without\u00a0 any authority\u00a0 or jurisdiction.\u00a0\u00a0 A case illustrating want of jurisdiction is that of Piper<i> vs.<\/i>\u00a0 Pearson\u00a0 (2 Gray, 120).\u00a0\u00a0 There a justice of the peace of the County of Middle sex tried an individual named Russ for an offense committed within the district of Lowell. By statute said justice had no power or authority to take cognizance\u00a0 of offenses committed\u00a0 \"within the district of Lowell.\"\u00a0 The court said: \"In\u00a0 the\u00a0 case at bar,\u00a0 the defendant had no more power to entertain jurisdiction of the complaint against Russ than any other individual in\u00a0 the community.\"\u00a0 \"If a magistrate\u00a0 acts beyond the limits of his jurisdiction, his proceedings are deemed to be coram\u00a0 non judice and void.\"\u00a0 \"If he has no jurisdiction of a cause, he can not sit as a magistrate to try it, and is entitled to no protection\u00a0 while acting beyond the sphere of his judicial power.\u00a0 His action is thus extrajudicial and void.\"<br\/><br\/>This case, however,\u00a0 is not one which ought fairly to be taken as generally illustrative\u00a0 of that class wherein\u00a0 the court acts\u00a0 wholly without jurisdiction, inasmuch as here whether or not the court had\u00a0 jurisdiction was a question of fact.\u00a0\u00a0 Whether or not the crime was committed \"within the district of Lowell\" was not a question of law.\u00a0\u00a0 Nevertheless, the same principle would have been involved if there had been a dispute as to the district within which the crime was\u00a0 actually committed and\u00a0 the\u00a0 court had\u00a0 decided that question upon\u00a0 conflicting evidence.<br\/><br\/>In\u00a0 the case\u00a0 of Bradley<i> vs.<\/i>\u00a0 Fisher (13\u00a0 Wall., 335),\u00a0 the\" court gave\u00a0 the following as illustrating\u00a0 a condition of complete lack of jurisdiction.<br\/><blockquote>\"Thus, if a\u00a0 probate\u00a0 court, invested only with authority over\u00a0 wills and the settlement of estates of deceased persons, should proceed to try parties for public offenses, jurisdiction over the subject of offenses being entirely wanting in the court, and this being necessarily known to its judge, his commission would afford no protection to him in the exercise of the usurped authority.\"<br\/><br\/>\"But if on the other hand a judge of a criminal court, invested with\u00a0 general\u00a0 criminal\u00a0 jurisdiction\u00a0 over offenses committed within a certain district, should hold a particular act to be a public offense, which is not by the law made an offense, and proceed to the arrest\u00a0 and trial of\u00a0 a party charged with such act, or should sentence a party convicted to a greater punishment than that authorized by the law upon its proper construction, no personal\u00a0 liability to civil action for such acts would attach\u00a0 to\u00a0 the\u00a0 judge, although those acts would be in excess of his jurisdiction, or of the jurisdiction of the court held by him, for these are particulars for his judicial consideration, whenever his\u00a0 general jurisdiction\u00a0 over\u00a0 the subject-matter\u00a0 is invoked.\u00a0 Indeed some of the most difficult and embarrassing questions which a judicial officer is called\u00a0 upon to consider and determine relate to his jurisdiction, or that of the court held by him, or the manner in\u00a0 which the jurisdiction shall be exercised. And the same principle of exemption\u00a0 from liability which obtains for errors committed in the ordinary prosecution\u00a0 of a suit where there is jurisdiction of both subject and person, applies in cases of this kind, and for the same reasons.\"<\/blockquote>This excerpt illustrates\u00a0 clearly the difference\u00a0 between excess of\u00a0 jurisdiction\u00a0 and\u00a0 lack\u00a0 of jurisdiction as\u00a0 it\u00a0 is universally presented by text writers as well as by courts.<br\/><br\/>The suggestions\u00a0 made after the discussion of the case\u00a0 of Lange <i>vs.<\/i> Benedict are, in principle and in effect, applicable to the cases just presented.\u00a0 Nothing could be clearer than that the court, in Clarke <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs.<\/span> May, acted wholly without jurisdiction.\u00a0 It is of no consequence what it is called, whether excess of jurisdiction or failure of jurisdiction; it still remains\u00a0 the same thing.\u00a0 The court\u00a0 itself\u00a0 said so\u00a0 when\u00a0 it used the words \"after its\u00a0 final disposition\u00a0 by a judgment, the authority\u00a0 to punish such contempt ceased,\u00a0 and that Clarke was therefore illegally\u00a0 committed.\"\u00a0\u00a0 The case\u00a0 of Austin <i>vs.<\/i> Vrooman is very like that of Gordon <i>vs.<\/i> Longest, wherein the Supreme Court of the United States held that the lower court acted wholly without jurisdiction in retaining the cause before it and\u00a0 proceeding to its disposition.<br\/><br\/>Being now fully informed of the meaning of the two legal conditions, \"excess of jurisdiction\"\u00a0 and \"lack\u00a0 of jurisdiction,\" and also of the difference between them as presented in the decisions\u00a0 of the courts,\u00a0 I now desire\u00a0 to consider whether this difference is worthy in any manner of effecting the exactly opposite legal results which it is alleged they produce.\u00a0 If they produce results so unlike, they should be so different in their essential natures as to be plainly and easily distinguishable.\u00a0\u00a0 Yet in spite of that, after a careful consideration of\u00a0 every\u00a0 adjudicated case upon the subject within my\u00a0 reach, I have been\u00a0 forced\u00a0 irresistibly to the conclusion\u00a0 that there is\u00a0 not, really and\u00a0 intrinsically, the slightest difference between\u00a0 them.\u00a0 The alleged difference is a fiction of law, pure and simple, born of the necessity to escape the logical but wholly unjust and indefensible consequences of a rule\u00a0 of liability based on no sound principle of law and\u00a0 incapable of defense upon any theory of logic or justice.<br\/><br\/>While\u00a0 we have\u00a0 seen from\u00a0 the cases\u00a0 cited\u00a0 the different circumstances which\u00a0 attended the courts up\u00a0 to the\u00a0 time when they performed the acts complained of, namely, that the one never had jurisdiction at\u00a0 all and the other had it at first but abandoned it later, we have nowhere\u00a0 seen in those authorities\u00a0 anything of the real nature of those two conditions nor why they should produce results so violently in opposition.\u00a0\u00a0 We have also seen from those cases that excess of\u00a0 jurisdiction is\u00a0 the state of being <i>beyond the<\/i> <i>limits<\/i> of jurisdiction, i. e.,\u00a0 <i>outside<\/i>\u00a0 of the\u00a0 power and authority conferred - so far outside indeed that the act of\u00a0 the\u00a0 court is <i>coram non judice<\/i> and void.\u00a0\u00a0 (Gordon <i>vs<\/i>.

S., 23.)\u00a0 We have also noted from those\u00a0 decisions that the only characteristic of excess of jurisdiction, the quality and the only quality which distinguished it from lack of jurisdiction, that which gave it its peculiar\u00a0 and distinctive\u00a0 virtue, was that, in excess of jurisdiction <i>the court had jurisdiction at the beginning of the cause, <\/i> but lost it later; whereas in\u00a0 lack of jurisdiction the court never\u00a0 had jurisdiction at all.<br\/><br\/>Now, if a court is really outside of the limits\u00a0 of his jurisdiction, what difference does it make, as to his\u00a0 liability for subsequent acts, <i>when<\/i> he\u00a0 arrived there?\u00a0 Ought the time when he finds himself outside to have any significance whatever?\u00a0 Should the fact that he was outside at the beginning of the cause, instead of when it had run half its course or more, have any force or effect?\u00a0 Is the judge who was never inside the jurisdictional inclosure any more outside of it than he who, having once been within, voluntarily steps wholly outside?\u00a0\u00a0 Both being completely outside, is one in worse position, legally or morally,\u00a0 than the other?\u00a0 Does the mere fact that the one had never been inside necessarily make him a greater malefactor than the other who comes as\u00a0 completely out, having once been in?\u00a0 Ought the legal consequences\u00a0 of their acts to\u00a0 be\u00a0 different\u00a0 when both\u00a0 are acting from exactly\u00a0 the same basis, viz, outside of their authority?\u00a0 One who steps from\u00a0 his house into the street is as much outside the\u00a0 structure\u00a0 as though he had never entered it;\u00a0 and while there, he is as unprotected from\u00a0 the elements\u00a0 as though he had never had a roof over his head. Although he may return to his house and enjoy again its shelters and comforts, still he can never change the fact that he\u00a0 once stood unprotected in the street, that the changing Wind had once buffeted him as it willed, that the storms had once\u00a0 drenched him to the skin, and that the frost had once bitten him to the\u00a0 bone.\u00a0 He who owns a million of money and throws it into the sea remains in as penniless a poverty as he who never owned\u00a0 a dollar in all his life.\u00a0 The\u00a0 court who,\u00a0 having once\u00a0 been clothed in\u00a0 the garment of jurisdiction,\u00a0 divests that garment, stands\u00a0 forth as judicially naked as\u00a0 he who\u00a0 had never been robed with the vestments of authority.\u00a0 So, the court that once had jurisdiction of a cause and divests\u00a0 that power by his own act stands thereafter as bereft of judicial authority as though he had never acted under sanction of the law.\u00a0 As a matter of language, that is the only meaning that can be given to the expression, \"excess of jurisdiction;\" as a matter of fact, that is the only definition claimed for it.<br\/><br\/>I am fully aware that a judge of a court which acts wholly without jurisdiction is, in a sense,\u00a0 a usurper.\u00a0 I know that a judge who proceeds in complete absence of jurisdiction, really and effectually by such act, makes a law to fit the case.\u00a0 In other words, he legislates.\u00a0\u00a0 I admit that to permit a judge thus to make a law and then to adjudicate it also is to permit an approach to tyranny.\u00a0 I am fully aware that this is the essence of the argument against the immunity of the\u00a0 judge who thus acts.\u00a0 It must not be forgotten,\u00a0 however, that we are discussing whether there is an essential difference between lack of jurisdiction\u00a0 and excess of jurisdiction.\u00a0\u00a0 If, therefore, we find that there is fully as much tyranny in the one as in the other, what matters\u00a0 it how much tyranny there may be in lack\u00a0 of jurisdiction?\u00a0 The cry\u00a0 of tyranny against acting without jurisdiction\u00a0 will be effectually stopped if it appears\u00a0 that\u00a0 acting\u00a0 in excess of jurisdiction,\u00a0 the\u00a0 thing which\u00a0 is\u00a0 permitted by the courts wholly to excuse, effects\u00a0 exactly the same result.\u00a0 That the one\u00a0 is as tyrannical as the other can\u00a0 not be\u00a0 doubted.\u00a0 A judge, having by\u00a0 law general jurisdiction criminally, who declares a state of facts presented\u00a0 to him to be a crime within the provisions of that law, when in reality it is not a crime at all, creates\u00a0 a law as distinctively and completely as does the judge who decides that\u00a0 there is\u00a0 a law giving him\u00a0 jurisdiction criminally, when in fact no such law exists. In such case, he declares a crime to exist when it really does not.\u00a0\u00a0 To enable a court to declare an act a crime, there must be a law making\u00a0 it a crime.\u00a0\u00a0 To declare an\u00a0 act a crime when there is no law making it such, is, so far as that particular case and all\u00a0 others like it are concerned, to make a law\u00a0 by judicial fiat.\u00a0 What signifies\u00a0 it that the court has jurisdiction of all\u00a0 larcenies if he declares an act a larceny which in\u00a0 truth and reality is not?\u00a0\u00a0 The fact\u00a0 that he has jurisdiction of all\u00a0 larcenies none the less makes his erroneous act the creation of a new law.\u00a0\u00a0 What does it signify that he once had jurisdiction\u00a0 when\u00a0 he thus, by his naked fiat,\u00a0 makes criminal an act otherwise legal and moral, and thereby convicts and imprisons an innocent man in violation of the law of the\u00a0 land.\u00a0 He could go no farther, could do no more,\u00a0 if he acted wholly without\u00a0 jurisdiction from the beginning.\u00a0 Of what significance is it that in the one case he acts in excess of jurisdiction\u00a0 and in\u00a0 the other without jurisdiction when he does exactly the same thing and produces exactly the same result in both cases?<br\/><br\/>We have already seen that the\u00a0 only difference which any court or text writer has been able to point out between the two cases is the fact that in the case of\u00a0 excess of jurisdiction the court had jurisdiction of the subject-matter at the beginning whereas in the other case jurisdiction was never present at all.\u00a0 The only use which courts and text writers have made of that\u00a0 difference, the only use in fact that could possibly be made of it, is that,\u00a0 having jurisdiction of the subject-matter, the court then has the power to determine whether or not a given set of facts presented to him to induce his action falls within his\u00a0 jurisdiction; whereas,\u00a0 in the case of failure of jurisdiction, there being in fact no law conferring powers, the court had no power or authority\u00a0 to determine anything whatever.\u00a0 It is urged also that an indispensable prerequisite of the effective administration\u00a0 of justice is that a judge, having jurisdiction, be\u00a0 allowed\u00a0 to decide whether\u00a0 a given set of facts\u00a0 is within the law by which\u00a0 his jurisdiction is conferred.\u00a0\u00a0 But is\u00a0 it any more necessary and\u00a0 essential that he be allowed to decide that question than\u00a0 it is that he be allowed to determine <i>whether he has any power at all in the premises?<\/i>\u00a0 Is it more essential for him to be allowed to decide whether a\u00a0 certain set of facts is or is not within his powers than it\u00a0 is to allow him to determine whether or not he<i> has<\/i> powers?\u00a0 Is it any more an\u00a0 inevitable prerequisite\u00a0 that he be permitted\u00a0 to determine the extent of his\u00a0 powers\u00a0 than\u00a0 that he be allowed to decide\u00a0 whether he has powers?\u00a0\u00a0 If he is a\u00a0 court, that very fact makes it necessary to determine what\u00a0 his powers are.\u00a0\u00a0 To do that he must not only determine what the laws are and what they mean, but <i>he must also\u00a0 determine whether there is a law. <\/i> It is sometimes a very much more difficult question to determine whether there is any law\u00a0 at all than it is to decide what the law means\u00a0 when its existence\u00a0 is admitted.\u00a0 But, comes the\u00a0 suggestion,\u00a0 the court in such cases having once had jurisdiction of the\u00a0 subject-matter \"no personal liability to civil action for such acts (in excess of jurisdiction) would attach to the judge,\u00a0 although those acts would be in excess of his jurisdiction or of the jurisdiction of the court held\u00a0 by him,\u00a0 for these are\u00a0 particulars for his <i>judicial\u00a0 consideration,<\/i>\u00a0 *\u00a0 * .\"\u00a0 (Bradley <i>vs.<\/i>\u00a0 Fisher, <i>supra.<\/i>)\u00a0 This suggestion may be answered in two ways:<br\/><br\/>It means nothing to say that the law\u00a0 required the lower court to act upon\u00a0 the question before it, it having jurisdiction of the cause at the time and\u00a0 it\u00a0 already having\u00a0 proceeded therewith to the point where it was confronted with the question concerning which it erred.\u00a0\u00a0 Exactly the same thing, in effect and in principle, may be said of\u00a0 the court which proceeded to\u00a0 take\u00a0 cognizance of a cause\u00a0 in entire absence of authority to do\u00a0 so.\u00a0\u00a0 For, the\u00a0 law also requires a court to act whenever a question is presented to it, no matter if it be one over which it has no power\u00a0 or authority whatever.\u00a0 Law and necessity alike compel him.\u00a0\u00a0 If he have no jurisdiction or authority,\u00a0 he must, nevertheless,\u00a0 act.\u00a0 He must declare he has not and refuse to\u00a0 proceed.\u00a0\u00a0 But the point is, <i>he must act, he must decide, he must adjudicate; and he must do so whether the question of Jus jurisdiction be clear or doubtful.<\/i> In both\u00a0 cases, excess of jurisdiction and\u00a0 failure of jurisdiction, the courts are confronted with exactly\u00a0 the same\u00a0 necessity, <i>each must\u00a0 act. <\/i>\u00a0 The\u00a0 question confronting one court, viz, whether it has jurisdiction or not, may be much more doubtful and far more difficult of solution than that which faces the other.\u00a0 Yet one is liable and the other not,\u00a0\u00a0 I have\u00a0 looked in vain for a valid or\u00a0 convincing reason why,\u00a0 both\u00a0 being in error, the judge of one court should be destroyed and the other saved.<br\/><br\/>This suggestion also contains an admission rather than an argument -\u00a0 an\u00a0 admission which\u00a0 destroys absolutely the theory that the crucial test in determining the civil liability of a judge is that of jurisdiction.\u00a0\u00a0 This suggestion admits that the thing which excuses is not <i>jurisdiction<\/i>, but <i>judicial action;<\/i>\u00a0 not <i>jurisdiction<\/i>,\u00a0 but\u00a0 the<i> exercise of the judicial function;<\/i> not jurisdiction,\u00a0 but \"judicial consideration;\" and that the only reason why the one excuses and the other does not is the opportunity which the former furnishes for the use of the judicial faculty.\u00a0 We\u00a0 must conclude, therefore, since it is not jurisdiction, but judicial action, which excuses, that whenever and wherever a court exercises the judicial function, he will not be personally liable civilly for the result of his action,\u00a0 and this\u00a0 utterly\u00a0 regardless of\u00a0 whether he ever had jurisdiction or\u00a0 not.\u00a0\u00a0 And that is precisely what\u00a0 I am contending for.\u00a0 I regard the doctrine\u00a0 of jurisdiction as counter to that public\u00a0 policy which\u00a0 lies\u00a0 at the base of and is the sole and whole reason for the immunity of judges from civil liability.\u00a0 That public policy\u00a0 demands that\u00a0 a judge shall be protected <i>when he is a judge,<\/i>\u00a0 not when he has jurisdiction.\u00a0\u00a0 He is\u00a0 a judge <i>when he acts\u00a0 like a judge<\/i>; that\u00a0 is,\u00a0 when he acts\u00a0 <i>judicially.<\/i>\u00a0 All\u00a0 that public\u00a0 policy requires in order to extend its perfect protection over the judge is that the question\u00a0 in which the error is made shall be a <i>judicial question<\/i>.\u00a0\u00a0 In other words, it is the nature of the question involved which is transcendently important, and not the\u00a0 position\u00a0 in\u00a0 which the judge finds himself legally, before, at the time of, or after his error.\u00a0\u00a0 The question is \"What kind of question\u00a0 were you deciding when you made that error?\" not \"What\u00a0 was your position before\u00a0 or after you made it?\"\u00a0 It is, it can be, of no consequence whatever whether there be failure of jurisdiction or excess of jurisdiction.\u00a0\u00a0 Is the\u00a0 question\u00a0 for determination\u00a0 one which requires the exercise of judicial functions for its resolution? If it is, then that is an end of the matter of liability, utterly irrespective of jurisdiction.\u00a0\u00a0 An error by which\u00a0 a court induces itself to act wholly without jurisdiction is an error of law, an error of judgment after consideration, of exactly the same nature as that which\u00a0 induces a court to act in excess of jurisdiction.\u00a0\u00a0 It is an\u00a0 error of judgment as to whether\u00a0 he has any power at all in the premises.\u00a0\u00a0 It is an erroneous determination of a question which,\u00a0 by virtue of the fundamental constitution\u00a0 of his office, is inexorably forced upon him\u00a0 for determination as his very first act in every case.\u00a0 Public policy, indeed, public necessity, demands that\u00a0 he\u00a0 act, if he\u00a0 is judge.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 safety,\u00a0 stability,\u00a0 and perpetuity of the State and its institutions imperatively require him\u00a0 to act.\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore,\u00a0 being thus\u00a0 driven to act, and his\u00a0 first act\u00a0 being necessarily and\u00a0 inevitably to determine\u00a0 whether\u00a0 his authority comprehends the subject- matter presented to him, can it possibly be true that public policy, the very force that drove him to act, will punish him for\u00a0 such action if he has exercised the very functions with\u00a0 which that\u00a0 public policy has endowed him?\u00a0\u00a0 I\u00a0 am aware that it may be said that public policy does not protect those who act wholly without authority. But my contention is that he has\u00a0 authority.\u00a0 The\u00a0 fact that\u00a0 he is a judge means nothing else.\u00a0 That one has\u00a0 been named a judge is no idle thing.\u00a0 It\u00a0 is to be presumed that he has some powers,\u00a0 that some authority attaches to the office,\u00a0 or it would not have been created.\u00a0 As\u00a0 a judge he has responsibility of the most\u00a0 solemn and important character.\u00a0 He has duties correspondingly solemn and important.\u00a0 By far the greatest\u00a0 and most important of these is <i>to determine what those powers are.<\/i>\u00a0 But this is simply the determination of the question of jurisdiction.\u00a0\u00a0 This\u00a0 is, as we have seen already, a judicial determination\u00a0 of the purest character.\u00a0 If he determines that question wrongly and proceeds thereafter to act, he acts wholly without jurisdiction.\u00a0 But is he more\u00a0 guilty or culpable than\u00a0 the\u00a0 judge who, with equal error,\u00a0 determines a\u00a0 similar question of jurisdiction but at a\u00a0 different\u00a0 period of the cause? Is it possible that one can be appointed to one of the highest and most august positions in the gift\u00a0 of man, and\u00a0 still not be able to determine what he may do without subjecting himself to the risk of financial ruin, and, mayhap, of imprisonment?\u00a0 If so, his office is not only a monstrous farce, but is also a thing which deserves, as it certainly will receive, the contempt and the jeers of mankind.\u00a0 I\u00a0 repeat that a judge acts judicially as purely and as perfectly\u00a0 when he is determining, at the very\u00a0 inception of the proceeding, the question\u00a0 of whether\u00a0 or\u00a0 not he has any jurisdiction\u00a0 whatever in the premises as he does when, later in the case, he decides what the extent of that jurisdiction is.\u00a0 That is a judicial\u00a0 determination as clearly and unmistakably as would be his decision that A was entitled to a judgment against B - only of a very much more fundamental character.\u00a0\u00a0 So\u00a0 that, if it\u00a0 is the use of the judicial function which\u00a0 absolves, why should the one be excused with the respect of the community and\u00a0 the\u00a0 other\u00a0 condemned with ruin and\u00a0 disgrace?\u00a0 But, comes the\u00a0 reply, a judge is\u00a0 not\u00a0 a judge if\u00a0 he have no jurisdiction; and he\u00a0 can\u00a0 not exercise\u00a0 judicial functions unless he is a judge.\u00a0 Therefore, if he have no jurisdiction he can not exercise judicial functions.\u00a0\u00a0 Not being able to exercise\u00a0 judicial functions, he can\u00a0 not,\u00a0 as a necessary consequence, be excused\u00a0 from liability, inasmuch\u00a0 as\u00a0 immunity from liability springs solely from \"the exercise of such functions.\u00a0 But\u00a0 that logic is fatally defective.\u00a0 Its major premise, namely, that if he have not\u00a0 jurisdiction a judge is not a judge and can not, therefore, exercise judicial functions, is wholly false.\u00a0 How is he to know whether he has jurisdiction or not?\u00a0 By what process does he determine whether or\u00a0 not\u00a0 he has any power\u00a0 at\u00a0 all?\u00a0 Does that\u00a0 determination come to him by inspiration?\u00a0 Is it handed to him\u00a0 ready-made?\u00a0 How\u00a0 does\u00a0 he arrive at the conclusion that he has jurisdiction or that there\u00a0 is a complete failure of it?\u00a0 Why does he arrive at\u00a0 one of these conclusions and not the other; and why does he not arrive at both?\u00a0\u00a0 Is he simply a man when he determines the question\u00a0 of jurisdiction but a judge when he decides every question in the case? The answer to these questions is simple. <i> The determination by the court of the question whether he has or has not jurisdiction is a judicial determination.<\/i>\u00a0 The\u00a0 indispensable prerequisite\u00a0 to the simplest and most\u00a0 elementary judicial act of any\u00a0 court is the determination of the question of jurisdiction.\u00a0\u00a0 It is utterly impossible for him to act in the simplest\u00a0 matter that can\u00a0 be brought before\u00a0 him without first making that determination.\u00a0 It is an inevitable necessity\u00a0 which\u00a0 is inexorably required\u00a0 to precede\u00a0 everything else in the functions\u00a0 of every court.\u00a0 It is thrust upon him instantly with the appearance of the first suitor in his court. It is\u00a0 the indispensable prerequisite\u00a0 of every\u00a0 judicial act. It was elemental in the creation of the judicial office.\u00a0 The implacable forces\u00a0 that created the\u00a0 office, the unalterable nature of its functions, drive him irresistibly to that primordial determination.\u00a0 That\u00a0 necessity is ever with him. It is imperative, merciless, and inexorable.\u00a0 Born with his office, it dies only\u00a0 with his office.\u00a0 May we say, then, that it is not a judicial determination - the\u00a0 exercise of judicial functions?\u00a0 Shall\u00a0 we assert that\u00a0 it is\u00a0 not an exercise of judicial function to resolve the very question which\u00a0 the elemental nature of his office inevitably requires him to decide as an absolute condition precedent to the performance of any other act in the cause?\u00a0 It seems to me that it can not be doubted\u00a0 that it\u00a0 is\u00a0 a judicial determination, and one of the very first importance.\u00a0 In fact, it\u00a0 is the\u00a0 highest and most important judicial function which a court can\u00a0 possibly exercise.<br\/><br\/>The court, although he\u00a0 sees his jurisdiction written as clear as light, makes, nevertheless, the\u00a0 judicial determination of jurisdiction as\u00a0 really and as\u00a0 fully as does the court who spends days and nights of laborious inquiry into doubtful laws to\u00a0 decide the same question.\u00a0\u00a0 The court who had jurisdiction and then exceeded it inevitably determined first of all that\u00a0 very question of primary jurisdiction\u00a0 as completely as did the court who, really having no jurisdiction, determined\u00a0 erroneously that he had; and, if\u00a0 the first had made a mistake in determining jurisdiction at the beginning, ought he to suffer more than he did suffer for making later in the cause the very same\u00a0 mistake, the mistake by which he exceeded his jurisdiction?\u00a0 The mistake in either case\u00a0 was over the same question,\u00a0 namely,\u00a0\u00a0 jurisdiction. Ought it, in fairness, to make any difference when the jurisdictional mistake is made?\u00a0 Ought the judge who made the mistake at the\u00a0 beginning of the cause to suffer more than he who made a mistake over the same question later in the same case?\u00a0 Ought an error in regard to jurisdiction made at the opening of court be more\u00a0 fatal or require severer punishment than\u00a0 one made at the close?\u00a0 Is a\u00a0 mistake greater because it was made at 10 a. m. than at 5 p. m.? To be sure, in the one case he had jurisdiction at first; but he used it only as a means to exceed that jurisdiction later, to put himself outside of it.\u00a0 That is simply a history of how he came to be outside of his jurisdiction but, of itself, it furnishes no reason\u00a0 why he\u00a0 should\u00a0 be\u00a0 excused from\u00a0 liability while the judge who never had jurisdiction should be ruined financially, disgraced before the public and his usefulness as a judge\u00a0 destroyed, wholly irrespective of\u00a0 the nature of the questions involved or the functions exercised, and utterly without regard to the results produced.\u00a0 I know it may be urged that the law having given the court\u00a0 jurisdiction and power to embark\u00a0 upon the cause, it must necessarily be presumed that he has also power and jurisdiction to dispose\u00a0 of it; and that if that disposition is wrong he ought not to be liable as he was simply performing the judicial duty which the law imposed.\u00a0\u00a0 Exactly.\u00a0 But when the judicial office is\u00a0 created and a judge is appointed, is\u00a0 there not, must there not be, a presumption of\u00a0 power on his part to determine the limits and extent of his\u00a0 jurisdiction?\u00a0 Indeed,\u00a0 must he not necessarily have the power\u00a0 to determine <i> whether he has any power at all or not<\/i>?\u00a0 The jurisdiction to determine whether he has jurisdiction?\u00a0 The\u00a0 question whether a\u00a0 court has any power at all is often involved in greatest doubt.\u00a0 The very existence of the law under which he is asked to act may be doubtful.\u00a0\u00a0 When\u00a0 its existence is assumed, its meaning, extent, scope, and application\u00a0 are many, many times open to the various interpretations.\u00a0 He must decide all these questions before he\u00a0 proceeds with the case presented.\u00a0 I say again,\u00a0 he must\u00a0 have,\u00a0 necessarily, jurisdiction to determine whether he has jurisdiction.\u00a0 Who is to determine that question if he does not?\u00a0\u00a0 He has no one to do it for him; no one\u00a0 to whom he may turn for assistance.\u00a0 There is no one to whom\u00a0 he\u00a0 may hand the responsibility.\u00a0 He must act\u00a0 He alone must assume the responsibility.\u00a0 He may not sit idly on his bench\u00a0 and refuse to act because he is uncertain whether or not he has the authority\u00a0 to act.\u00a0 Such conduct\u00a0 would warrant his\u00a0 removal from office.\u00a0\u00a0 But removal would not be the cure inasmuch as his\u00a0 successor would be in the same condition of doubt.\u00a0 If the judge refused to act in every case where jurisdiction was in doubt,\u00a0 a court of justice would be a rank imposture.\u00a0 <i>The judge must act<\/i>, and he must act not only in cases of doubt\u00a0 upon the\u00a0 merits\u00a0 where\u00a0 jurisdiction is conceded, but he must also act in cases where jurisdiction <i>itself over the whole subject-matter is a serious and doubtful question.<\/i>\u00a0\u00a0 How can it be said, then, that in the one case he is liable and in the other he is not?\u00a0 A judge of a court having jurisdiction and acting on the merits of a question may, by a decision plainly and manifestly in violation of the law, literally confiscate the property of a party litigant and thereby reduce him and his family\u00a0 to beggary, himself escaping entirely unscathed; while the judge of another court who, by an erroneous assumption of jurisdiction after a thorough and painstaking investigation of that question, a question concerning which\u00a0 the\u00a0 best minds might\u00a0 reasonably\u00a0 differ, promotes thereby real\u00a0 justice between the parties upon the merits,\u00a0 would, nevertheless, be helplessly liable to respond fully in damages for the injuries caused by his act, with all that such liability might imply to his fame, his fortune, and his official position.<br\/><br\/>It may be added, by way of repetition, that it signifies nothing to say that, because a court finds himself lawfully in the midst of a cause, he\u00a0 must be allowed to determine it in one way or another, and that in doing so he should be protected.\u00a0 It is no more essential that he continue it than that he <i>begin<\/i> it.\u00a0\u00a0 A litigant who is not permitted to finish is in no worse condition than one who was never allowed to begin.\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, if it is held that the law requires a court to <i>begin right,<\/i> it must be\u00a0 equally true that a court having begun right,\u00a0 <i>must continue right. <\/i> There should be no more license to <i>continue wrong<\/i>\u00a0 than to <i>begin\u00a0 wrong.<\/i>\u00a0 The prohibition should be equal in both cases.\u00a0 While it is true that a court can not give itself\u00a0 jurisdiction by determining that it has it, nevertheless, that idea in nowise militates against the position here taken, as the argument which it presents is as applicable to a case\u00a0 involving excess of jurisdiction as to one where there is want of jurisdiction.<br\/><br\/>If\u00a0 we follow strictly\u00a0 the\u00a0 rule which holds civilly liable the court who, at the beginning of the cause, errs as to his jurisdiction over the subject-matter, and wholly excuse him who errs as to his jurisdiction over\u00a0 the subject-matter later in the cause,\u00a0 we have this result:<br\/><br\/>A\u00a0 matter\u00a0 is presented to a court for action.\u00a0 He has really no\u00a0 jurisdiction whatever\u00a0 over\u00a0 it; but,\u00a0 after\u00a0 due deliberation decides that he has, and proceeds.\u00a0 He arrests A, tries and convicts him of\u00a0 homicide, and sentences him to twenty years\u00a0 in prison.\u00a0\u00a0 Question determined, jurisdiction. Act, <i>coram non judice<\/i> and void.\u00a0 Result, judge liable.<br\/><br\/>A matter is presented to\u00a0 another court for\u00a0 action.\u00a0 He has jurisdiction in the first instance.\u00a0 He proceeds.\u00a0\u00a0 Later he arrives at a point in the case where he fails\u00a0 absolutely of jurisdiction\u00a0 to proceed further with\u00a0 the\u00a0 cause.\u00a0\u00a0 But, after due deliberation, he nevertheless decides\u00a0 that he has jurisdiction and proceeds.\u00a0 He\u00a0 tries\u00a0 and convicts\u00a0 B of homicide and\u00a0 sentences him\u00a0 to twenty\u00a0 years in prison. Question determined, jurisdiction.\u00a0\u00a0 Act, <i>coram non judice<\/i> and<i> void.<\/i>\u00a0 Result, judge not liable.<br\/><br\/>Why this difference in\u00a0 result?\u00a0\u00a0 It\u00a0 is no answer to say that, in the second case,\u00a0 the court, having jurisdiction, had, therefore,\u00a0 the right to determine any question that might arise\u00a0 during the progress\u00a0 of the case, even if it be a question as to his jurisdiction to proceed further, and in making such determination he would be protected; for, in the first case, the fact that he is\u00a0 a court gives him this right, as it places upon him the duty to\u00a0 determine whether he has the authority to inaugurate the proceedings, and in the determination of that question he, too, ought to be protected.\u00a0 The determination\u00a0 of the jurisdictional right to\u00a0 <i>begin<\/i>, is of exactly the same nature and quality as the determination of the jurisdiction to continue.\u00a0 The resolution of the two questions involves exactly the same mental processes, the use of exactly the same discretion, the adoption of precisely the same methods, the exercise of identical functions; while the purposes\u00a0 animating the courts in their decisions\u00a0 are absolutely the same in\u00a0 both cases,\u00a0 namely, the faithful\u00a0 and efficient\u00a0 discharge of\u00a0 the\u00a0 duties and obligations\u00a0 of\u00a0 the office. The two questions themselves, as representing the two legal conditions, are exactly the same inherently.\u00a0\u00a0 The fact that one question is determined at one stage of the cause, while the other\u00a0 is decided at another, is purely accidental and incidental.<br\/><br\/>Let me give an example more concrete: Whether or not a Court of First Instance of the Philippine Islands has jurisdiction over a given subject-matter\u00a0 depends upon whether or not a certain law of Spanish origin in force prior to the American occupation survived the change\u00a0 of sovereignty. If that law\u00a0 survived he has jurisdiction.\u00a0 If it\u00a0 did not, he is absolutely devoid of\u00a0 jurisdiction.\u00a0\u00a0 The determination of that question involves a careful investigation of the fundamental law of the Islands as derived from American sources; an interpretation of its\u00a0 force and significance as well as the scope of its application; the\u00a0 construction of the order of the President to General Merritt and of the proclamation of the latter to the Philippine people, both heretofore quoted, and last, and perhaps most difficult of all, the resolution of the question presented by that part of the above-mentioned order of\u00a0 the President\u00a0 which\u00a0 provides that \"the municipal laws of the conquered territory, such as affect private rights of person and property, and provide for the punishment of crime, are considered as continuing in force, <i>so far as they are compatible with the new order of things.\"<\/i>\u00a0 When\u00a0 is a Spanish law \"compatible with the\u00a0 new\u00a0 order\u00a0 of things.\" and when incompatible?\u00a0 Upon the determination of that question\u00a0 depends absolutely the jurisdiction of the court. Was ever a\u00a0 question more perfectly judicial?\u00a0 Could there possibly be a question in the resolution of which the judicial function was more clearly exercised?\u00a0\u00a0 Has there ever been, or will there ever be, a situation in which a man could be more a judge than here?\u00a0 Yet we are asked to hold that the Court of First Instance would not be protected in the determination of that question.<br\/><br\/>Moreover, this rule takes no cognizance whatever, as we have\u00a0 before noted,\u00a0 of the nature of the questions to be solved by the\u00a0 two judges in question.\u00a0 It makes no difference between cases where the question of jurisdiction is of great\u00a0 doubt\u00a0 and\u00a0 difficulty\u00a0 and\u00a0 those where\u00a0 the lack of jurisdiction and authority is so plain and clear that it ceases altogether to be a question.\u00a0 For example, in the illustration given, wherein the Court of First Instance was obliged to determine the existence of a Spanish law, there is presented a question of great intricacy and extreme difficulty of determination.\u00a0 Yet the judge who decides that question, after the most careful and painstaking investigation and study, and decides it wrongly, receives,\u00a0 under the doctrine we are discussing, no more mercy than another judge who, during the progress of the cause, orders the head\u00a0 of one of the parties stricken off by the sheriff,\u00a0 Although the lack of jurisdictional\u00a0 authority\u00a0 or power to\u00a0 make such\u00a0 an order is so clear and so plain that it can not be a question of any kind\u00a0 or from any point of\u00a0 view, and especially not\u00a0 one requiring for\u00a0 its solution the exercise of the judicial functions; and although such an act so transgresses every judicial precedent, so violates every principle of law, so outrages the commonest sense of justice, and so debauches the functions\u00a0 and purposes of a\u00a0 court,\u00a0 that no judge\u00a0 can be heard to say that he was exercising\u00a0 judicial functions\u00a0 in\u00a0 the performance\u00a0 of such an\u00a0 act, nevertheless, that judge, so far as his civil responsibility\u00a0 is\u00a0 concerned,\u00a0 stands,\u00a0 under the doctrine referred to,\u00a0 in exactly the same position as the judge who clearly and admittedly exercised judicial functions\u00a0 in the determination\u00a0 of\u00a0 a\u00a0 question over which the best legal minds have been found to differ.<br\/><br\/>Still worse.\u00a0\u00a0 A judge who, even while acting in excess of his jurisdiction, corruptly and criminally sells\u00a0 his judgment to whomsoever pays him highest, and thus debauches\u00a0 and prostitutes the\u00a0 functions of his\u00a0 office before\u00a0 the\u00a0 world, would not be liable civilly to the\u00a0 person injured; while another judge, learned in the law, unimpeachable in integrity, unquestioned in honesty, but who made a mistake of judgment over the intricate and doubtful question of his initial jurisdiction, would be ruined financially and his usefulness as a judge completely destroyed.\u00a0\u00a0 And all this because one judge erroneously\u00a0 decided the question of jurisdiction at the beginning\u00a0 of the cause,\u00a0 while the other erroneously decided the same question later in the case.<br\/><br\/>Under this doctrine I am anxious to know what reason would be\u00a0 given for holding civilly liable a judge who, as a court, having jurisdiction of the cause and parties, should order the head of one of the\u00a0 parties stricken off and that order should be obeyed.\u00a0 That\u00a0 he would\u00a0 be so liable is certain.\u00a0\u00a0 But what reason could be given for it under the doctrine that jurisdiction is the touchstone of liability?\u00a0 He had jurisdiction of the cause, and,\u00a0 under the doctrine,\u00a0 had the right to pass upon any question which he might regard as related to the case, and he could\u00a0 not be questioned civilly for so passing his judgment even though it lead him wholly outside\u00a0 and beyond his jurisdiction\u00a0 and induced him to perform acts completely illegal and void.\u00a0 It is no answer to say that the act was wholly outside of his jurisdiction and power to perform and was illegal and void, for, so was the act\u00a0 of the United States Circuit Court judge in Lange <i>vs.<\/i> Benedict, <i>supra<\/i>; and yet he\u00a0 was held not to be civilly liable.\u00a0\u00a0 The only difference between the two cases, from the standpoint of the doctrine of jurisdiction, is in degree\u00a0 and not in kind.\u00a0 The mere fact that he acted in excess of his jurisdiction is not sufficient to\u00a0 condemn under the doctrine.\u00a0\u00a0 Neither is\u00a0 it a\u00a0 reply\u00a0 to\u00a0 say that such a question could not possibly\u00a0 arise in the case, nor that such an act was so gross and apparent a violation of the duties of the court and such a palpable prostitution of his proper functions, that he would not be allowed to say that he acted as a judge in the performance of\u00a0 such an act.\u00a0\u00a0 These are not answers, they are admissions; for they impliedly and necessarily base the liability of the judge not upon the question of jurisdiction\u00a0 but upon the proposition\u00a0 that the question was one the determination of which required the exercise of judicial functions.\u00a0 The essence of the\u00a0 whole matter is this: Was the determination\u00a0 of the\u00a0 question\u00a0 whether\u00a0 he had the right to perform the act complained of one which required the exercise of the judicial function?\u00a0\u00a0 Whether or not\u00a0 he\u00a0 was, in the resolution of\u00a0 the\u00a0 question, exercising judicial functions does not at all depend\u00a0 upon whether he had jurisdiction of the subject-matter of the cause.\u00a0\u00a0 As we have said, a court may exercise judicial functions\u00a0 as perfectly and as fully in determining whether he has jurisdiction of the subject-matter presented to him for action\u00a0 as he may in deciding any question\u00a0 in the case when his jurisdiction of the subject-matter\u00a0 is conceded.\u00a0\u00a0 A court always has\u00a0 power and jurisdiction to determine whether\u00a0 it has jurisdiction.<br\/><br\/>We thus\u00a0 see\u00a0 the\u00a0 embarrassment which is necessarily present in attempting,\u00a0 under the doctrine that jurisdiction determines liability, to hold a judge who has jurisdiction of the cause civilly\u00a0 liable for performing an act outside of his jurisdiction\u00a0 no matter how far\u00a0 outside it may be.\u00a0 It is as apparent, also, that all such embarrassment disappears when, instead of making.jurisdiction the test\u00a0 of liability, we make the exercise of judicial functions\u00a0 the real test.<br\/><br\/>I believe that it has been thoroughly established that the test\u00a0 of judicial liability is not\u00a0 jurisdiction.\u00a0 I believe it has also been as thoroughly established that such liability depends wholly upon the nature of the question which was being determined when the error complained of was made by the court; that\u00a0 is,\u00a0 it must have\u00a0 been a question the determination of which required\u00a0 the\u00a0 exercise of judicial functions.\u00a0 With that condition,\u00a0 jurisdiction\u00a0 has nothing vital to do.<br\/><br\/>When, then,\u00a0 is a judge civilly\u00a0 liable for his illegal acts? When the\u00a0 question which he wrongly determines is\u00a0 one\u00a0 in the solution\u00a0 of which he can not be said to use judicial attributes.\u00a0 I again present the illustrations I have already given.\u00a0 During the course of a trial the judge orders the head of one of the parties stricken\u00a0 off by the sheriff.\u00a0 As we have already said,\u00a0 such an act so transgresses\u00a0 every judicial precedent, so violates every principle of law, so outrages the commonest\u00a0 sense of justice, and\u00a0 so\u00a0 debauches the functions and purposes of a court, that no judge can be heard to say that he was exercising judicial functions in its performance.\u00a0 His lack of power is so clear that, whether he\u00a0 has\u00a0 such power, <i>ceases to be a question. <\/i>\u00a0 There\u00a0 are certain limits beyond which a judge will not be permitted to say that he was a judge, or that\u00a0 he was acting as a judge. On the other hand, the example\u00a0 given in which the\u00a0 Court of First Instance was required to determine the question of the survival of the Spanish law in order to reach a conclusion as to whether he had jurisdiction or not, clearly\u00a0 dis-closes a case where\u00a0 the judicial\u00a0 attributes\u00a0 were exercised. That is a question over which courts in general may\u00a0 really differ.\u00a0\u00a0 Concerning it two opinions are allowable.\u00a0 In other words, there are two sides to the question.\u00a0 If the question is one which a judge, qualified in the average way for the position occupied by the offending judge or for a similar judicial position, would regard\u00a0 as\u00a0 a question,\u00a0 then it is one whose determination requires the exercise of judicial functions.\u00a0 But\u00a0 if it is one so clear that a\u00a0 judge, qualified as aforesaid, would not regard it as a question, then it is one whose determination does not require\u00a0 the exercise of judicial functions.\u00a0\u00a0 In the former\u00a0 case\u00a0 the judge is\u00a0 not liable.\u00a0 In the latter, he is.\u00a0 To\u00a0 put it in another way: If the question is\u00a0 one which can\u00a0 be\u00a0 regarded\u00a0 by a judge, qualified as above stated, as having two sides, then the judge is not liable for an erroneous decision.\u00a0 But if it be\u00a0 one which can not be regarded by such judge as having two sides, then the judge is liable for a wrong decision.<br\/><br\/>Although it is admitted, as I do admit, that the Governor-General had and has no\u00a0 power or\u00a0 authority to\u00a0 expel domiciled\u00a0 aliens, it must, nevertheless, be freely conceded, and this is the vital and conclusive point in this case, that from his point of view there are two sides to that question. That\u00a0 such is\u00a0 the\u00a0 case\u00a0 is\u00a0 conclusively\u00a0 established by the fact that three judges of this court have already decided, after mature deliberation, that he actually has such powers. This being so,\u00a0 it becomes a real question, the determination of which\u00a0 requires the exercise\u00a0 of judicial functions.\u00a0 In such determination he is protected even though he errs.<br\/><br\/>Whether or\u00a0 not a given question is such a one as I have above described, that is, whether it is one which would be regarded by a judge, qualified in the average way for the position occupied by the offending judge or a similar judicial position, as having\u00a0 two sides, is always a question of law and not of fact.\u00a0 It is a\u00a0 condition established by the existing law.\u00a0 It is a matter not susceptible of proof.\u00a0 The court is required to take judicial notice of\u00a0 the law of the land.\u00a0 It can not be established by evidence.\u00a0 The condition, the state, of the law when the offending act was committed is fixed.\u00a0 It can not be changed by\u00a0 evidence.\u00a0 When the act is\u00a0 admitted, liability is a pure question of law.\u00a0 Even the motive which influenced or controlled the judge in his decision can not be proved.\u00a0\u00a0 It\u00a0 is immaterial\u00a0 under the doctrine of Bradley vs. Fisher.\u00a0 He is not judged from his moral\u00a0 but from his legal relation to the question.<br\/><br\/>The foregoing is an explanation, if one were\u00a0 needed, of the expression\u00a0 in my former opinion in this case, in which I made reference to the Governor-General acting \"in the <i>honest belief,<\/i>\" that he had the authority to perform the acts complained of.\u00a0 By such expression I did not mean to call attention to the Governor-General subjectively.\u00a0 I did not mean to bring\u00a0 in issue his state of mind, morally or ethically, at the time he acted,\u00a0 nor the motive which impelled him. What\u00a0 was meant\u00a0 there\u00a0 is,\u00a0 Was the\u00a0 question which confronted him for solution one\u00a0 over which men qualified for that or a similar station would really differ; one which the average\u00a0 man fit for that position would\u00a0 regard as a real question?\u00a0\u00a0 In\u00a0 other words, Is it one which, from the viewpoint of a man ordinarily qualified for that position, has two sides?\u00a0\u00a0 \"Honestly,\" as used, referred to the nature of the question rather than the state of mind or motive of the\u00a0 Governor-General.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 state of mind morally\u00a0 of\u00a0 a judge, the motives which induce him to act, are of no consequence in determining his liability.\u00a0 In the case of Bradley <i>vs.<\/i> Fisher, <i>supra,<\/i> cited in my former opinion as well as in this, the court says:<br\/><blockquote>\"Nor can this exemption of the judges from civil liability be affected by the motives with which their judical acts are performed.\u00a0 The\u00a0 purity of their motives can\u00a0 not in this way be the subject of judicial inquiry.\u00a0 This was adjudged in the case of Floyd and Barker, reported by Coke, in\u00a0 1608 (12\u00a0 Coke, 25), where it was\u00a0 laid down that the judges of the realm could not be drawn in question for any supposed corruption impeaching\u00a0 the verity of their\u00a0 records, except before the King himself, and it was observed that if they were required to\u00a0 answer otherwise,\u00a0 it would 'tend to the scandal and subversion\u00a0 of all justice, and those who are the most\u00a0 sincere would not be free from continual calumniations.'<br\/><br\/>\"The truth of this latter observation is\u00a0 manifest to all persons having much experience with judicial proceedings in the superior courts.\u00a0 Controversies involving not merely great pecuniary interests, but the liberty and character of the parties and, consequently, exciting the deepest feelings, are being constantly determined in those courts, in which there is a great conflict\u00a0 in the evidence and great doubt as to the law which should govern\u00a0 their\u00a0 decision.\u00a0 It is this class of cases which imposes upon the judge the severest labor, and often create in his mind a painful sense of responsibility.\u00a0 Yet it is precisely in this class of cases that the losing party feels most keenly the decision against him, and most readily accepts anything but the soundness of the decision in\u00a0 explanation of the action of the judge.\u00a0\u00a0 Just in proportion to the strength\u00a0 of his convictions of the correctness of his own view of the case is he apt to complain of the judgment against him, and from complaints of the judgment to pass\u00a0 to the ascription of improper motives to the judge.\u00a0\u00a0 When the controversy involves questions affecting large amounts of property or relates\u00a0 to a matter of general public concern, or touches the interests of numerous parties, the disappointment occasioned by an adverse decision\u00a0 often finds vent in imputations of this character, and from the imperfection of\u00a0 human nature this\u00a0 is hardly a subject of wonder. If civil actions could be maintained in such cases against the judge, because the losing party should see fit to allege in\u00a0 his complaint that the acts of the judge were done with partiality,\u00a0 or maliciously, or corruptly,\u00a0 the protection essential to judicial independence would be\u00a0 entirely swept away.\u00a0\u00a0 Few persons sufficiently irritated to institute an action against\u00a0 a judge for his judicial acts would hesitate to ascribe any character to the acts which would be essential to the maintenance of the action.<br\/><br\/>\"If upon such allegations a judge could be compelled to answer in a civil action for his judicial acts, not only would his office be degraded and\u00a0 his usefulness destroyed, but he would be subjected for\u00a0 his protection to the necessity of preserving a complete record\u00a0 of all the evidence produced before him\u00a0 in every litigated case, and of the\u00a0 authorities cited and arguments presented,\u00a0 in order that he might be able\u00a0 to show to the judge\u00a0 before whom he might be summoned by the losing party - and that judge perhaps one of an inferior jurisdiction - that he had decided as he did with judicial integrity;\u00a0 and the second judge would be subjected to a\u00a0 similar burden, as he in his turn might also be held amenable by the losing party.<br\/><br\/>\"Some just observations on this head by the late Chief Justice Shaw will\u00a0 be found in Pratt <i><i>vs<\/i><\/i>. Gardner (2 Cush., 68),\u00a0 and the point here was adjudged in the recent case of Fray <i>vs<\/i>.\u00a0 Blackburn\u00a0 (3\u00a0 Best &amp; S., 576)\u00a0 by the Queen's Bench of England.\u00a0 One of the judges of that bench\u00a0 was sued for a judicial act, and on demurrer\u00a0 one of the objections taken to the declaration was that it was\u00a0 bad in\u00a0 not alleging malice.\u00a0 Judgment on the demurrer having passed for the defendant, the plaintiff applied for leave to amend his declaration by introducing an allegation of\u00a0 malice and corruption; but Mr. Justice Compton replied:\u00a0 'It is a principle of our law that no action will lie against a judge of one\u00a0 of the superior courts for a judicial act, though it be alleged to have been done maliciously and corruptly; therefore the proposed allegation would not make the declaration good.\u00a0 The public are deeply interested in this rule, which, indeed, exists for their benefit, and was established in order to secure the independence of the judges, and prevent them being harassed\u00a0 by vexatious actions;' and\u00a0 the\u00a0 leave was refused.\u00a0\u00a0 (Scott <i>vs<\/i>.

S., 285), decided by this court at the December term of 1868, we had occasion to consider at some length the liability of judicial officers to answer in a civil action for their judicial acts.\u00a0 In that case the\u00a0 plaintiff had been removed by the defendant, who was one of the justices of the Superior Court of Massachusetts, from the bar of that State, and\u00a0 the action was brought for such removal, which was alleged in the declaration to have been made without lawful authority and wantonly, arbitrarily, and\u00a0 oppressively.\u00a0 In considering the questions presented, the court observed that it was a general principle, applicable to all judicial officers, that they were not liable to a civil action for\u00a0 any judicial act done by them within their jurisdiction;\u00a0 that with reference to judges of limited and inferior authority it had been held that they were protected only when they acted within their jurisdiction; that if this were the case with respect\u00a0 to them, no such limitation existed\u00a0 with respect to judges of superior or general authority; that they were not liable in civil actions for their judicial acts, even when such acts were in excess of their jurisdiction, 'unless, perhaps, when the acts in excess of jurisdiction are done maliciously or corruptly.1\u00a0 The qualifying words were inserted\u00a0 upon the suggestion that the previous language laid down the doctrine of judicial exemption from liability to civil\u00a0 actions in terms broader\u00a0 than was necessary for\u00a0 the case under consideration, and that if the language remained unqualified it would require an explanation of some apparently conflicting adjudications found in the\u00a0 reports.\u00a0 They were not intended as\u00a0 an expression of opinion that in the cases supposed such liability would exist, but to avoid the expression of a contrary doctrine.<br\/><br\/>\"In the present case we\u00a0 have looked into the authorities and are clear, from them, as well as from the principle on which any\u00a0 exemption is maintained, that\u00a0 the qualifying words used were not necessary to a correct statement of the law, and that judges of courts of superior or general jurisdiction are not liable\u00a0 to civil actions for their judicial acts; even when such\u00a0 acts are in\u00a0 excess of their jurisdiction, and are alleged\u00a0 to have been\u00a0 done maliciously or corruptly.\"<\/blockquote>Applying\u00a0 to the case at bar the analogy to which we have so far\u00a0 consistently adhered,\u00a0 it\u00a0 is necessary\u00a0 to\u00a0 conclude, from the principles\u00a0 asserted\u00a0 in the quotation,\u00a0 that the motives with which the illegal acts of the\u00a0 Governor-General were performed can\u00a0 not affect in any\u00a0 way\u00a0 his\u00a0 response bility.\u00a0\u00a0 For the same reason, and for the reasons\u00a0 stated heretofore, the liability of the Governor-General is a question of\u00a0 law and not\u00a0 of fact.\u00a0\u00a0 It depends entirely\u00a0 on the state\u00a0 of the law,\u00a0 of\u00a0 that\u00a0 the court takes\u00a0 judicial\u00a0 notice without proof.<br\/><br\/>The foregoing discussion is not a criticism of the case of Bradley vs. Fisher, so many times referred to.\u00a0\u00a0 On the contrary,\u00a0 I\u00a0 am confident\u00a0 that this case,\u00a0 when\u00a0 properly viewed,\u00a0 is, as I\u00a0 have heretofore\u00a0 stated, fully in accord with the considerations\u00a0 and conclusions\u00a0 indulged herein, and may reasonably, indeed, if the dictum therein contained have any force whatever, must necessarily be taken\u00a0 as an authority for them.\u00a0 In that case the name of the plaintiff was stricken\u00a0 from the roll of attorneys practicing in the criminal branch\u00a0 of the supreme court of the District of Columbia by the judge thereof, the defendant in the action. The following was the order entered\u00a0 by the court:<br\/><blockquote>\"On the 2d day of July last,\u00a0 during the progress of the trial of John H.

But if, on the other hand, a judge of a criminal court, invested with general criminal jurisdiction over offenses committed within a certain district, should hold a particular act to be a public offense,\u00a0 which is not by the law made an offense,\u00a0 and proceed to the arrest and trial of a party charged\u00a0 with such act, or should sentence a party convicted to a greater punishment than that authorized by the law upon its proper construction, no personal liability to civil action for such acts would attach\u00a0 to the judge, although those acts would be in excess of his jurisdiction, or of the jurisdiction of the court held by him,\u00a0 for these are particulars for his judicial\u00a0 consideration, whenever his general jurisdiction\u00a0 over the subject-matter\u00a0 is\u00a0 invoked. Indeed some of the most difficult and embarrassing questions which a judicial officer is called upon to consider and determine relate to his jurisdiction,\u00a0 or that of the court held by him, or the manner in which the jurisdiction shall be exercised.\u00a0\u00a0 And the same principle of exemption from liability which obtains for errors committed in the ordinary prosecution of a suit where there is jurisdiction of both subject and person applies in\u00a0 cases of this kind, and for the same reasons.\"<\/blockquote>It must be\u00a0 noted,\u00a0 in the first place,\u00a0 that, inasmuch as the\u00a0 court, in that case, was found to have had full jurisdiction of the person of the plaintiff and the subject-matter before him,\u00a0 the court erring simply in his\u00a0 method of procedure, the question of the civil liability of a judge for acts performed with complete lack of jurisdiction did not arise.<br\/><br\/>In the\u00a0 second\u00a0 place, especial and\u00a0 particular attention is called to certain expressions in\u00a0 the decision\u00a0 which occur in that portion relative\u00a0 to the liability of\u00a0 a judge acting in complete absence of jurisdiction: \"Where there is clearly no jurisdiction\u00a0 over the\u00a0 subject-matter\u00a0 any\u00a0 authority\u00a0 is a usurped authority, and for the exercise\u00a0 of\u00a0 such authority, <i>when the want of jurisdiction\u00a0 is\u00a0 known to the judge,<\/i>\u00a0 no excuse is\u00a0 permissible.\"\u00a0 Again: \"Thus if a probate court, invested only with authority over wills and the settlement of estates\u00a0 of deceased\u00a0 persons, should\u00a0 try\u00a0 parties\u00a0 for public offenses,\u00a0 jurisdiction\u00a0 over\u00a0 the subject\u00a0 of\u00a0 offenses being entirely wanting in the court,\u00a0 and\u00a0 this\u00a0 being necessarily known to its judge, his commission would\u00a0 afford no\u00a0 protection to him in the exercise of the usurped authority.\"<br\/><br\/>Those portions of the sentence quoted\u00a0 which I have italicized contain\u00a0 the essence of the whole\u00a0 matter\u00a0 of judicial liability where there is a lack or failure\u00a0 of jurisdiction. I am of the\u00a0 opinion that those expressions indicate necessarily and\u00a0 decisively\u00a0 that the principle which I have herein laid down as the\u00a0 one logically and inevitably governing judicial liability is the\u00a0 true one and the only one whose results are not absurdities in\u00a0 many cases.\u00a0 Otherwise those expressions are\u00a0 wholly meaningless\u00a0 and\u00a0 the\u00a0 suggestions they contain valueless.\u00a0 If jurisdiction is the\u00a0 real test of liability, if a judge acting wholly and completely without jurisdiction\u00a0 is necessarily liable, as contend\u00a0 text writers and courts generally, what difference does it make whether the want of jurisdiction <i>\"clearly\"<\/i> appears or not.\u00a0 If entire absence of\u00a0 jurisdiction\u00a0 is\u00a0 decisive,\u00a0 what\u00a0 does\u00a0 it signify whether or\u00a0 not\u00a0 <i>\"the want of jurisdiction is known to the judge.\"<\/i>\u00a0 lf the\u00a0 crucial test is jurisdiction, what\u00a0 means the phrase \"and this (entire want of jurisdiction) <i>being necessarily known to its judg<\/i>e?\"\u00a0 If these expressions\u00a0 mean nothing, then there is an end of the matter so far as the case we are discussing is concerned.\u00a0 But if they mean anything at all commensurate with\u00a0 the signification\u00a0 which would ordinarily be given to the words which compose them, then they\u00a0 destroy utterly the doctrine that jurisdiction is the test of judicial liability.\u00a0 The word \"clearly\" refers either to the judge himself or to some one or something apart from him.\u00a0 If to the\u00a0 judge, then the want of\u00a0 jurisdiction must be clear to him before he can be liable. But if his want of jurisdiction is clear to him and he still goes forward with the cause, he must be actuated by a motive other than his belief that\u00a0 he\u00a0 is within his\u00a0 jurisdiction.\u00a0 If,\u00a0 therefore, \"dearly\" refers to the judge himself, to his subjective condition, then it can have no relation or materiality except to disclose the motive which moved him.\u00a0 But motive has been expressly held by this very\u00a0 case to be wholly immaterial in determining a judge's civil liability.\u00a0\u00a0 Motive \"Is merely a state of mind.\u00a0\u00a0 If\u00a0 motive\u00a0 can have no influence\u00a0 on the matter, then it is of no consequence whatever what the state of mind may be.\u00a0 This\u00a0 is in perfect\u00a0 accord with the universal doctrine\u00a0 that one man's rights can\u00a0 not be made to depend on another man's mind.\u00a0 If A illegally\u00a0 injures B, B's right of action can not be dependent\u00a0 on A's state of mind when he caused the inj ury,\u00a0 Such state of mind might have some influence on the\u00a0 amount of damages or the kind of action to be\u00a0 brought, but never\u00a0 on the right of action. So the right of action against a judge never can be made to depend on the state of mind of the judge who causes the injury, but only and solely upon the nature of the question determined.\u00a0\u00a0 Rights are children\u00a0 of the law, not of man's fancy.<br\/><br\/>If, however, the word \"clearly\" refers to some\u00a0 one or something apart from the judge himself, then the expression in which it occurs has\u00a0 meaning and significance.\u00a0 If the want of jurisdiction is so \"clear,\" not to that judge in particular, but to a judge having the average qualifications for the position occupied by the offending judge, or a similar judicial position, that whether or not there is jurisdiction is not a question at all, then we can\u00a0 understand what was intended by the use of the word \"clearly.\"\u00a0 The whole doctrine that the civil liability of a judge depends upon jurisdiction alone, as stated by text writers and enforced by most courts, is utterly at variance with the\u00a0 conception that the state of mind\u00a0 of the offending judge should have any influence on his\u00a0 liability.\u00a0 Moreover,\u00a0 the very case\u00a0 I\u00a0 am discussing holds clearly that\u00a0 public policy requires that the motives of a judge in deciding a\u00a0 cause, his state of mind accompanying or even\u00a0 causing\u00a0 his decision, shall have no influence in determining his liability.\u00a0\u00a0 We find in that case the following:<br\/><blockquote>\"Yet it is precisely in this class of cases that\u00a0 the losing party feels most keenly the decision against Mm, and most readily accepts anything but the soundness of the decision in explanation of the action of the judge.\u00a0\u00a0 Just in proportion to the strength of his conviction of the correctness of his own view of the case is he apt to complain of the judgment against him, and from complaints of the judgment to pass to the ascription of improper motives to the\u00a0 judge. When\u00a0 the controversy involves questions\u00a0 affecting large amounts of property or relates to a matter of general public concern, or touches the interests of numerous parties,\u00a0 the disappointment occasioned by an adverse\u00a0 decision\u00a0 often finds vent\u00a0 in imputations of this\u00a0 character, and from\u00a0 the imperfections\u00a0 of human nature this is hardly a\u00a0 subject of wonder.\u00a0 If civil actions could be maintained in such cases against the judge, because the losing party should\u00a0 see fit to allege in his complaint that the acts of\u00a0 the judge were done with partiality, or maliciously, or corruptly, the protection essential to judicial independence would be\u00a0 entirely swept away.\u00a0 Few persons sufficiently irritated to institute an action against a judge for his judicial acts would hesitate to ascribe any character to the acts which would be essential to the maintenance of\u00a0 the action.\"<\/blockquote>Motive, as here used, can\u00a0 not be restricted to a state of mind morally\u00a0 wrong.\u00a0 It includes\u00a0 also a state of mind legally wrong.\u00a0\u00a0 A judge, knowing full well that he is absolutely without jurisdiction, who, in spite of that knowledge, proceeds with the cause, condemning one of the parties in complete violation of the law, may\u00a0 be impelled thus to violate the law by an honest\u00a0 belief that he is thereby doing justice between the parties; but his\u00a0 motives\u00a0 are nevertheless tainted with illegality, and, even though they are not morally wrong, they fall within the definition\u00a0 of \"motives\" as that word is\u00a0 used in the decision I am discussing. But even though I be wrong\u00a0 in that contention, it nevertheless is certain that if a corrupt motive can not be influential in determining the liability of a judge,\u00a0 one not corrupt can not be.<br\/><br\/>It, therefore, seems to me clear that the word \"clearly\" as used in the case under discussion does not refer to the state of mind of the offending judge, but rather to the nature of the question which he determines; not to the way the judge himself views\u00a0 the question, but to the way it would\u00a0 be viewed by the standard judge, the average judge, as I have heretofore stated.<br\/><br\/>What I have said of the word \"clearly,\" as it appears in the case under discussion, is\u00a0 equally applicable to the other expressions quoted therefrom.\u00a0 The phrase \"when the want of jurisdiction is\u00a0 known\u00a0 to\u00a0 the judge\" presents precisely the same question.\u00a0 As I have said, the very case in which that expression occurs holds\u00a0 unequivocally that the motives which move the judge to action are not permitted to weigh for or against him, even though they are corrupt\u00a0 and immoral.\u00a0\u00a0 It can not be possible, then, that any other motive, especially an honest one, can be permitted to affect his case. The\u00a0 conclusion is, therefore, unavoidable that the phrase \"when the want of jurisdiction is known to the judge\" does not refer to the actual state of mind of the judge but to the state of mind which he ought to be in and which he would have been in if he had taken into consideration properly the nature of the question before him.\u00a0\u00a0 In other words, he will be deemed\u00a0 to have\u00a0 been in the same state of mind as the ideal, the standard\u00a0 judge of whom we have\u00a0 spoken would have been had he had the same\u00a0 question before him.\u00a0\u00a0 We have here somewhat the idea which is predominant in the theory of negligence embodied in the question, \"Did he use the care which an ordinarily careful and prudent man would have used\u00a0 under the same circumstances?\"\u00a0 This means simply that everything depends, in the last analysis, on the nature of the question with which the judge was\u00a0 dealing when he committed the error made the basis of the action against him.<br\/><br\/>Lastly, as to the phrase \"and this [the want of jurisdiction] being necessarily known to its judge.\"<br\/><br\/>The word \"necessarily\" seems to me to be absolutely conclusive as\u00a0 to the intention\u00a0 of the\u00a0 Supreme\u00a0 Court of the United States in\u00a0 the case under discussion relative to the doctrine of judicial liability in cases involving a failure or want of jurisdiction.\u00a0\u00a0 This expression, it will be remembered, was used\u00a0 in connection with the\u00a0 illustration\u00a0 of a probate court assuming criminal jurisdiction.\u00a0\u00a0 Why, in such illustration, should the want of jurisdiction be <i>\"necessarily<\/i>\" known to the judge?\u00a0 No reason can be given except that it was\u00a0 a perfectly plain case, and,\u00a0 in consequence, he was bound to know it, whether he actually did or not.\u00a0 In other words, the\u00a0 question which he was called upon to decide was so plain and so clear that the standard judge would not have regarded it as a question\u00a0 at all;\u00a0 i.e,, there was really only one side to\u00a0 it. it could be decided in only one way. Therefore,\u00a0 the judge was bound to know\u00a0 it; it was necessarily known to him.\u00a0 <i>The nature of the question was such that he was estopped from\u00a0 denying knowledge.<\/i>\u00a0 Thus are we brought back again to the proposition I have so often asserted,\u00a0 that the\u00a0 liability of the\u00a0 judge depends wholly upon the nature of the question in the determination\u00a0 of which the error was made.<br\/><br\/>It appears to me to be evident, therefore, that the case of Bradley <i>vs.<\/i> Fisher is an authority, so far as dictum can\u00a0 be such, in support of the doctrine I am advocating, both affirmatively and negatively.\u00a0 Affirmatively, because it asserts the doctrine that the nature of the question controls.\u00a0 Negatively, because it also asserts that\u00a0 the\u00a0 motives which induced the judge to the error which is the basis of his liability are wholly immaterial in establishing that liability. This\u00a0 necessarily means,\u00a0 as we have already seen, that the state of mind of the judge by which the error was induced, of whatever kind it may be, good,\u00a0 bad, or indifferent, is entirely without significance as an element\u00a0 of his liability. This is all I set out to establish.\u00a0\u00a0 (See Bishop Non-Contract Law, par. 783; Root <i> vs.<\/i> Ross, 72 Northwestern, 1022; Grove <i>vs.<\/i>\u00a0 Van Duyn, 15 Vroom, 654.)\u00a0 Section 9 of the Code\u00a0 of Civil Procedure\u00a0 relating to the liability of judges is simply declaratory of the law as heretofore set forth.<br\/><br\/>The discussion up to this point has proceeded upon the theory that\u00a0 the Governor-General\u00a0 acted wholly without power, authority, or jurisdiction.\u00a0 I here note\u00a0 by way\u00a0 of suggestion merely that it should be remembered that the Governor-General, in\u00a0 performing the acts\u00a0 complained of, was operating in a field distinctively his own, namely, that of the execution\u00a0 of the law.\u00a0\u00a0 Of that branch of the government he is the head.\u00a0\u00a0 Over that field he has general authority\u00a0 and jurisdiction.\u00a0\u00a0 Taking for the moment the position of those who maintain that there is a difference between excess of\u00a0 jurisdiction and an\u00a0 entire\u00a0 failure\u00a0 of jurisdiction, may not his act of expulsion have been in excess of jurisdiction rather than in complete failure thereof?\u00a0 I do not now stop to argue this question,\u00a0 inasmuch as I have\u00a0 already presented the matter fully from the other point of view.<br\/><br\/>I have treated thus\u00a0 at length the liability of\u00a0 judges of analogical purposes, founding myself not\u00a0 only upon the reason and principle involved, but\u00a0 also upon the case of Spalding <i>vs<\/i>. Vilas\u00a0 (161\u00a0 U, S., 483), in which the opinion discussed at length the civil liability of judges, using the principles there applied as a foundation for the determination of the liability of the defendant, who was postmaster-general,\u00a0 and who had been sued for damages alleged to have been caused by certain acts performed by him in the execution of what he believed to be the duties of his office. This is precisely what I have done\u00a0 in the case at bar.<br\/><br\/>So far I have discussed the liability of the Governor- General\u00a0 for\u00a0 the acts complained\u00a0 of, viewing the acts as springing from\u00a0 the determination of questions judicial in their nature.\u00a0 I now propose to treat the question at bar as arising from determinations made and acts performed by the Governor-General in discharging the duties laid upon him as Chief Executive of the Government.<br\/><br\/>The immunity of judges from personal liability for damages resulting from their\u00a0 wrongful acts while\u00a0 in the\u00a0 discharge of the duties of the office rests wholly in public policy. The reasons for such immunity are nowhere\u00a0 better stated than in Mr. Cooley's work on Torts.\u00a0 He says:<br\/><blockquote>\"1. The necessary result of the liability would be to occupy the judge's time and mind with the defense of his own interests, when he should be giving\u00a0 them up wholly to his public duties, thereby defeating, to\u00a0 some extent, the very purpose for which his office was created.<br\/><br\/>\"2. The effect of putting the judge on his\u00a0 defense as a wrongdoer necessarily is to lower the estimation in which his office is held by the public, and any adjudication against him\u00a0 lessens the\u00a0 weight of his subsequent decisions.\u00a0 This of itself\u00a0 is a serious\u00a0 evil, affecting the whole community; for the confidence and respect of the people for the government will always repose most securely on the judicial authority when it is esteemed, and must always be unstable and unreliable when this is not respected.\u00a0 If the judiciary is unjustly assailed in the public press, the wise judge refuses to put himself in position of defendant by responding,\u00a0 but he leaves the tempest to rage until an awakened public sentiment silences his detractors.\u00a0 But if he is forced upon his defense, as was well said in an early\u00a0 case, it 'would\u00a0 tend to the scandal and subversion of all\u00a0 justice, and those\u00a0 who are most sincere would not be free from continual calumniations.'<br\/><br\/>\"3. The civil responsibility of the judge would often be an incentive to dishonest instead of honest\u00a0 judgments,\u00a0 and would invite him to consult public opinion\u00a0 and public prejudices,\u00a0 when he ought to be wholly above and uninfluenced by them.\u00a0\u00a0 As every suit against him would be to some extent an appeal to popular feeling, a judge,\u00a0 caring specially for his own protection, rather than for the cause\u00a0 of\u00a0 justice, could not well resist a leaning adverse to the parties\u00a0 against whom the popular passion or prejudice for the time being was running, and he would thus become a persecutor in the cases where he ought to be a protector, and might count with confidence on escaping responsibility in the very cases in which he ought to be punished.\u00a0 Of what avail, for example, could the civil liability of the judge have been to the\u00a0 victims of the brutality of Jeffreys if,\u00a0 while he was at\u00a0 the height of his power\u00a0 and\u00a0 influence\u00a0 and was wreaking\u00a0 his brutal passions upon\u00a0 them amidst the applause of crowded court rooms, these victims had demanded redress against\u00a0 him at the hands of any other court and jury of the realm?<br\/><br\/>\"4. Such civil responsibility\u00a0 would constitute a\u00a0 serious obstruction to\u00a0 justice, in that it would render essential a large increase\u00a0 in the judicial force,\u00a0 not only as it would multiply litigation, but as it would open\u00a0 each case to\u00a0 endless controversy.\u00a0\u00a0 This of itself\u00a0 would be an incalculable evil. The interest of the public in general rules and in\u00a0 settled order is vastly greater than in any results which only affect individuals; courts are for the general\u00a0 benefit rather than for the individual; and\u00a0\u00a0 it is\u00a0 more\u00a0 important that their action shall tend to the peace and quiet of society than that, at the expense of order,\u00a0 and after many suits,\u00a0 they shall finally punish\u00a0 an officer with damages for his misconduct. And it is to be borne in mind that if one judge can be tried for his judgment, the one who presides on the trial may also be tried for his, and thus the process may go on until it becomes intolerable.<br\/><br\/>\"5.\u00a0 Bui where the judge is really deserving of condemnation a prosecution at the instance of the State is a much more effectual method of bringing him to account than\u00a0 a private suit.\u00a0\u00a0 A want of integrity, a failure to apply his judgment to the case before him, a reckless or malicious disposition to delay\u00a0 or defeat justice may\u00a0 exist\u00a0 and be perfectly capable of\u00a0 being\u00a0 shown, and yet not be made\u00a0 so apparent by the facts of any particular case that in a trial confined to those facts he would be condemned.\u00a0 It may\u00a0 require the facts of many\u00a0 cases to establish\u00a0 the\u00a0 fault; it may be necessary to show the official action for years.\u00a0\u00a0 Where an officer is\u00a0 impeached, the whole official career is or may be gone into; in that case one delinquency after another\u00a0 is perhaps shown -\u00a0 each\u00a0 tends to characterize the other,\u00a0 and the whole will enable the triers to form a just opinion of the official integrity.\u00a0\u00a0 But in a private suit the party would be confined to the facts of his own case.\u00a0 It is against inflexible rules that one man should be allowed to\u00a0 base\u00a0 his recovery for his own benefit on\u00a0 a wrong done to another; and could it be permitted, the person first wronged, and whose\u00a0 right to redress would be as complete as any, would lose this\u00a0 advantage by the\u00a0 very fact that he\u00a0 stood first in\u00a0 the line of injured persons.<br\/><br\/>\"Whenever, therefore, the\u00a0 State confers judicial powers upon\u00a0 an\u00a0 individual, it confers them with full immunity from private suits,\u00a0 In effect, the State says to the officer that these duties are confided to his judgment; that he is to exercise his judgment fully, freely, and without favor, and he may exercise it without fear;\u00a0 that\u00a0 the duties concern individuals, but they concern more especially the welfare of the State and the peace and happiness\u00a0 of society; that if he shall fail in the faithful discharge of them\u00a0 he\u00a0 shall be called to account as a criminal; but that in\u00a0 order that he may not be\u00a0 annoyed, disturbed, and impeded in the performance of these high\u00a0 functions, a\u00a0 dissatisfied\u00a0 individual shall not be suffered to call in question his official action in\u00a0 a\u00a0 suit\u00a0 for damages.\u00a0 This\u00a0 is\u00a0 what the State, speaking by the month of the common\u00a0 law, says to the judicial\u00a0 officer.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Cooley on Torts, 2d ed., pp. 475-478.)<\/blockquote>The following cases are also in point:\u00a0 Bradley vs. Fisher (13 Wall., 335), Spalding <i>vs<\/i>.

One is quite\u00a0 useless without the other.\u00a0 The\u00a0 legislature is supremer than a king in the making of laws, but if\u00a0 they remain unexecuted they are but dry thunder that\u00a0 rolls and growls along the sky but disappoints the husbandman in a thousand thirsty fields.\u00a0 The judiciary is an invincible and irresistible giant in promulgating its decrees, but a day-old infant in their execution.<br\/><br\/>Whatever impedes or prevents the free and unconstrained activity\u00a0 of a governmental department, within its proper limits, tends to evil results.\u00a0\u00a0 The civil responsibility of the chief executive would\u00a0 produce in him an inevitable tendency, insidious\u00a0 in\u00a0 character,\u00a0 constant\u00a0 in pressure, certain\u00a0 in results, to protect himself by following lines of least resistance and to temper the force of his executive arm\u00a0 in places and\u00a0 upon\u00a0 occasions\u00a0 where there was strong opposition, either by powerful and influential persons or by great federated interests,\u00a0 and\u00a0 where public prejudice\u00a0 was intense, active, and threatening.\u00a0 Personal interest is a force which in the long run is apt to drive as it will.\u00a0 Reputation, pride, riches, family, home, all endangered in many respects\u00a0 by personal responsibility,\u00a0 are influences which grip and cling with thews of steel and exert a power upon\u00a0 men\u00a0 almost incalculable in its extent, almost certain in\u00a0 its\u00a0 results.\u00a0\u00a0 To allow these well-nigh irresistible forces to\u00a0 exercise to\u00a0 the full their effects\u00a0 upon the coordinate branches of the government, through men who, for the moment, are, in a sense, the state, is to drive a blow at the very vitals\u00a0 of impartial government.<br\/><br\/>Anyone may bring an action.\u00a0 It needs no merits, no real grounds, no just cause,\u00a0 no expectation of winning, to commence suit.\u00a0 Any person who feels himself aggrieved\u00a0 by any\u00a0 action of the\u00a0 chief executive,\u00a0 whether\u00a0 he have\u00a0 the slightest grounds therefor or not, may begin suit.\u00a0 Or, not particularly desiring to bring action upon his own initiative, he may be induced thereto by any evil-disposed person, any political rival, party antagonist, or personal enemy of the chief executive, or\u00a0 by any person desiring\u00a0 for any reason to see\u00a0 his\u00a0 administration hampered\u00a0 and brought into contempt\u00a0 by public display of the alleged\u00a0 inefficiency of\u00a0 the chief functionary.\u00a0 For the purposes in view,\u00a0 it is almost immaterial whether or\u00a0 not the action succeeds.\u00a0\u00a0 Substantially the\u00a0 same results are\u00a0 attained\u00a0 by commencing\u00a0 the action\u00a0 and carrying it haltingly to its final determination. A person\u00a0 who brings an action for the reasons mentioned, or his\u00a0 inducers, will always be fertile and conscienceless in the method of conducting it.\u00a0 Every means\u00a0 will be employed to make it sensational.\u00a0\u00a0 Every effort\u00a0 will be used to bring the salient features\u00a0 of the plaintiff's claim before the public.\u00a0 Opposition\u00a0 papers will deem it strategy to lend their ready columns to everything that reflects adversely on the defendant.\u00a0 Startling headlines will appear\u00a0 in\u00a0 every issue inviting all people to read the charges against their chief executive.\u00a0 Occasions for delay will be found or made. The case will drag along through months of calumny, vituperation,\u00a0 and\u00a0 sensation until\u00a0 the\u00a0 people,\u00a0 nauseated and weary of the noise and the spectacle, cry for\u00a0 riddance. This is precisely the result desired by the plaintiff.\u00a0\u00a0 The matter can be stopped and quieted only by the removal of the offending official.\u00a0 This would usually follow in one way or another.<br\/><br\/>Moreover, the bringing of an action against him because of his act in\u00a0 relation to a given matter\u00a0 would naturally prevent his taking further or\u00a0 other steps\u00a0 against\u00a0 other persons similarly circumstanced\u00a0 until the\u00a0 final\u00a0 determination of the pending action.\u00a0 Respect for law and the judiciary, as well as his own protection, would probably require this.\u00a0 No words are\u00a0 necessary to indicate the\u00a0 intolerable condition\u00a0 thus resulting from general civil\u00a0 responsibility. Action upon important matters\u00a0 of state delayed;\u00a0 the time and substance\u00a0 of the chief executive spent in wrangling litigation; disrespect\u00a0 engendered for the person of one of the highest officials of\u00a0 the State and\u00a0 for the office he occupies;\u00a0 a\u00a0 tendency to unrest\u00a0 and disorder; resulting, in a way, in a\u00a0 distrust as to the integrity\u00a0 of government itself.<br\/><br\/>Although the three departments of the\u00a0 government are coordinate and of equal importance in the administration of governmental affairs, nevertheless, it is\u00a0 generally recognized that,\u00a0 in many ways, and at least popularly,\u00a0 the chief\u00a0 executive\u00a0 is the\u00a0 first man in the state.\u00a0 He is regarded\u00a0 by the public generally\u00a0 as\u00a0 the official who\u00a0 most nearly represents the\u00a0 people, who most perfectly epitomizes the government and\u00a0 the state.\u00a0\u00a0 An assault upon him is, popularly speaking at least, an assault upon the people.\u00a0 An offense\u00a0 against him is\u00a0 an offense against the state.\u00a0 Generally speaking, the government is\u00a0 good or bad\u00a0 as\u00a0 he is good or bad.\u00a0 To degrade and humiliate him is to\u00a0 degrade and humiliate the government. To put him on trial as a wrongdoer is to put on trial\u00a0 government itself.\u00a0 To\u00a0 bring him publicly to the bar is to breed in the. public mind an unwholesome disrespect not only for his person but for his office as\u00a0 well; while\u00a0 a decision\u00a0 against him is, popularly speaking\u00a0 at least,\u00a0 not only a\u00a0 license to disregard his subsequent acts as unworthy of consideration, but also a partial demonstration of the\u00a0 inefficiency of\u00a0 government itself.\u00a0 As the state\u00a0 may not be held\u00a0 liable, and by\u00a0 such\u00a0 process its sovereignty weakened, without express provision of law, so the\u00a0 person most\u00a0 perfectly its\u00a0 incarnation\u00a0 should\u00a0 not be subjected civilly to personal liability for damages resulting from the performance of official acts except by law\u00a0 equally express.<br\/><br\/>While the\u00a0 three coordinate\u00a0 governmental\u00a0 departments are mutually\u00a0 dependent, each being unable to perform its. functions without the other, they\u00a0 are, nevertheless, paradoxical as it may seem, wholly\u00a0 independent of each other, except for what is known\u00a0 as the\u00a0 checks\u00a0 and balances of government.\u00a0 That\u00a0 is\u00a0 to say,\u00a0 one department\u00a0 may\u00a0 not control or interfere in any way with another in the exercise of its functions.\u00a0 This, of course, is fundamental.\u00a0\u00a0 The legislature may neither dictate to the courts what judgments they shall render, nor modify, alter or set\u00a0 aside such judgments after they have been promulgated.\u00a0\u00a0 The legislature can not\u00a0 be permitted to override executive\u00a0 action nor interfere with the performance of those duties laid\u00a0 by\u00a0 the constitution upon the chief executive. In the same way,. the courts have no power to control or interfere in any way with the legislature in the making\u00a0 of\u00a0 laws or in taking or refraining from taking\u00a0 any action whatever, however clear may be its constitutional duty to take or not to\u00a0 take such action.\u00a0\u00a0 The legislature may refuse to pass laws which are absolutely necessary for the preservation\u00a0 of society, thus clearly\u00a0 and openly violating\u00a0 and\u00a0 disregarding\u00a0 the trust reposed in it, and still neither the judicial nor the executive branch can interfere.\u00a0 The courts may\u00a0 openly\u00a0 and\u00a0 flagrantly violate their duty, render the\u00a0 most partial, unjust, illegal, and even\u00a0 corrupt judgments, thereby openly prostituting their\u00a0 proper\u00a0 functions,\u00a0 yet neither the legislature nor the executive department can interfere.<br\/><br\/>Moreover, except as herein before indicated, neither\u00a0 the members of the legislature nor of the judiciary are subject to personal liability for damages either by their\u00a0 failure to perform\u00a0 their\u00a0 duties or\u00a0 for their open\u00a0 defiance of the plain command of the constitution to perform them.<br\/><br\/>The power\u00a0 to\u00a0 interfere is the\u00a0 power to control.\u00a0 The power to control is the power\u00a0 to\u00a0 abrogate.\u00a0 Upon what reasons, then, may we base the right of the courts to interfere with the\u00a0 executive branch\u00a0 of the\u00a0 government by taking cognizance of a personal action against the chief executive for damages resulting from an official act; for, to take jurisdiction of such an action is one of the surest methods of controlling his action.\u00a0 We\u00a0 have already\u00a0 seen the\u00a0 dangers which\u00a0 lurk in the unhampered\u00a0 privilege\u00a0 of personal suit against the chief executive from\u00a0 the viewpoint of the effects which it would have on him personally and,\u00a0 therefore,\u00a0 on the general enforcement\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 law. Another question\u00a0 closely akin\u00a0 to this is that of the effect on the independence of that branch of the government.\u00a0 In that argument we touched the results of such responsibility from the viewpoint of the influence wielded by the person who complained by\u00a0 suit against the act of the chief executive.\u00a0 Here we refer to it\u00a0 from the\u00a0 standpoint of the force,\u00a0 the\u00a0 power,\u00a0 the instrumentality by\u00a0 which the complaint is made effective.\u00a0\u00a0 Every argument advanced against the civil responsibility of the chief executive founded in the baneful results to the public welfare which such responsibility would inevitably carry, is applicable to the proposition that the court may\u00a0 take cognizance of personal actions against him for damages resulting from his official acts. If the\u00a0 courts may\u00a0 require the chief executive to pay a\u00a0 sum of money\u00a0 every time they believe\u00a0 he\u00a0 has\u00a0 committed an error in\u00a0 the discharge of his official duty which prejudices any\u00a0 citizen, they hold such a grip upon the vitals of the executive branch of the government that they may swerve it from the even tenor of its course or\u00a0 thwart altogether the purpose of its creation. If such responsibility would prove\u00a0 harmful by reason of the influence thus given to persons or interests involved in the execution of the law, how much\u00a0 more disastrous would\u00a0 be the\u00a0 results of such responsibility which\u00a0 would normally flow from the power which the courts might wield, that power which alone makes effective\u00a0 the influence of\u00a0 the persons or\u00a0 interests referred to, not only determining\u00a0 their remedy\u00a0 and adjudicating their rights, but also fixing the amount of damages which the infringement of those rights has occasioned.\u00a0\u00a0 That the courts may declare a law passed by\u00a0 the legislature\u00a0 unconstitutional and void, or an act of the\u00a0 executive unauthorized and illegal; or that\u00a0 the legislature may curtail within limits the jurisdiction and power of the courts, or restrict, in a\u00a0 measure,\u00a0 the\u00a0 scope of executive action; or that\u00a0 the executive may, by his veto, render null and ineffective\u00a0 the acts of the legislature and thus effectually thwart the purposes of the majority, is no reply to the argument presented. These are merely the checks\u00a0 and balances made by\u00a0 the people through the constitution inherent in the form of government for its preservation as an effective institution. Without\u00a0 them the government\u00a0 would collapse like a house of cards.\u00a0 In spite\u00a0 of these checks and balances, if not by reason of them, the fundamental departments of the government are independent of each other in\u00a0 the truest sense of the word.\u00a0 The quality\u00a0 of government\u00a0 consists in their remaining so.<br\/><br\/>It must not be forgotten that there is a great difference, intrinsically and in result, between the power to declare the executed acts of the\u00a0 chief executive\u00a0 illegal and\u00a0 void, and the power to hold him personally responsible in\u00a0 damages resulting from\u00a0 such acts.\u00a0 In the one case the results are, in a real sense, entirely impersonal.\u00a0 No evil to him\u00a0 directly flows from such acts.\u00a0 He is secure in his person and estate.\u00a0 In the\u00a0 other, he is directly involved personally in a high and effective responsibility.\u00a0 His person and estate are alike\u00a0 in danger.\u00a0\u00a0 In the one\u00a0 case\u00a0 he acts freely and fearlessly without fear of\u00a0 consequences.\u00a0\u00a0 In\u00a0 the\u00a0 other he proceeds\u00a0 with fear and trembling, not knowing, and being wholly unable to know, when he will be called upon\u00a0 to pay heavy damages to some person\u00a0 whom he has unconsciously injured.<br\/><br\/>The principle of nonliability,\u00a0 as herein enunciated, does not mean that the judiciary has no authority to touch\u00a0 the acts of the Governor-General; that he may, under cover of his office, do what he will, unimpeded\u00a0 and unrestrained. Such\u00a0 a construction would\u00a0 mean that tyranny, under\u00a0 the guise of the\u00a0 execution\u00a0 of the law, could walk\u00a0 defiantly abroad, destroying rights of person and of property, wholly free from interference of courts or legislatures.\u00a0 This does not mean,\u00a0 either, that a person injured by the executive authority by\u00a0 an act unjustifiable\u00a0 under\u00a0 the\u00a0 law has no remedy, but must submit in silence.\u00a0 On the contrary, it means,\u00a0 simply, that the Governor-General, like the judges of the courts and the members of the Legislature, may not be personally mulcted in civil damages for the consequences of an act executed in the performance of his official duties. The judiciary has full power to, and will, when the matter is properly presented to it and the occasion justly warrants it, declare an\u00a0 act of the Governor-General illegal\u00a0 and void and place as nearly as possible in\u00a0 status quo any person who has been deprived\u00a0 of his liberty or his\u00a0 property by such act.\u00a0 This remedy is assured to every person, however humble\u00a0 or of whatever country, when his personal or property rights have been invaded, even by the highest authority of the state.\u00a0 The thing which the judiciary can not do is to mulct the Governor-General personally in damages which result from the\u00a0 performance of his\u00a0 official duty, any more than it\u00a0 can\u00a0 a member of the Philippine\u00a0 Commission or the Philippine\u00a0 Assembly.\u00a0 Public policy forbids it.<br\/><br\/>Neither does this principle of non-liability mean that the chief executive may not be personally sued at all in relation to acts which he claims to perform as such official.\u00a0\u00a0 On the contrary, it clearly appears from the discussion heretofore had, particularly that portion which touched the liability of judges and drew an analogy between such liability and that of the Governor-General, that\u00a0 the latter is liable\u00a0 when he acts in a case\u00a0 so plainly outside of his power and authority that he can not be said\u00a0 to have\u00a0 exercised discretion in determining whether or not he\u00a0 had\u00a0 the right to act.\u00a0\u00a0 What is held here is\u00a0 that he will be protected from personal liability for damages not only when he acts within his authority, but also when he is without authority, provided he actually used discretion and judgment,\u00a0 that\u00a0 is, the judicial faculty, in determining whether he had authority to act or not.\u00a0 In other words, he is entitled to protection in determining the question of his authority.\u00a0 If he decide wrongly, he is still protected provided the question of his authority was one over which two men, reasonably qualified for that position, might honestly differ; but he is not protected if the lack of authority to act is so plain\u00a0 that two such men could not honestly differ over\u00a0 its determination. In\u00a0 such case,\u00a0 he acts, not as Governor-General, but as a private individual, and, as such, must answer for the consequences of his act.<br\/><br\/>The attorneys for the defendant in the action before us earnestly contend that even though the Governor-General is not liable, his agents, Harding\u00a0 and Trowbridge, are.\u00a0 In support of that contention they cite numerous authorities. One of those is Little <i>vs<\/i>. Barreme (2 Cranch, 170).\u00a0 This was a\u00a0 case in which the commander of a ship of war of the United States had obeyed certain instructions emanating from\u00a0 the President of\u00a0 the United States which were not strictly warranted by the law under which said instructions were given; and had seized\u00a0 a\u00a0 ship not subject to\u00a0 seizure under\u00a0 the law.\u00a0 The\u00a0 attorneys for the defendant cite that portion of the opinion of Mr.\u00a0 Chief Justice Marshall\u00a0 in that case which reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"These orders given by the executive under the construction of the Act of Congress made by the\u00a0 department\u00a0 to which\u00a0 its execution was assigned,\u00a0 enjoined the seizure\u00a0 of American vessels sailing from a French port.\u00a0\u00a0 Is the officer who obeys\u00a0 them liable for damages sustained by this\u00a0 misconstruction of the Act, or will his orders excuse him?\u00a0 If his instructions afford him\u00a0 no\u00a0 protection,\u00a0 then\u00a0 the law must take its course, and he must pay such damages as are legally\u00a0 awarded against him;\u00a0 if they excuse an act not otherwise excusable, it would then\u00a0 be necessary to\u00a0 inquire whether this is a case in which\u00a0 the probable cause which existed to induce a suspicion\u00a0 that the vessel was American, would excuse the captor from damages when\u00a0 the vessel appeared in fact to be neutral.<br\/><br\/>\"1 confess the first bias of my mind was very strong in favor of the opinion that though\u00a0 the instructions\u00a0 of\u00a0 the executive could not give a right, they might yet excuse from damages.\u00a0 I was much inclined to\u00a0 think that a distinction ought to be taken between acts of civil and those of military officers;\u00a0 and between proceedings\u00a0 within the\u00a0 body\u00a0 of\u00a0 the country and those\u00a0 on the high seas.\u00a0 That implicit obedience which military men\u00a0 usually pay to the orders of their superiors, which indeed is indispensably necessary to every military system, appeared to me strongly to imply the principle that those orders, if not to perform a prohibited act, ought to justify the person whose general duty it is to obey them, and\u00a0 who\u00a0 is placed by the\u00a0 laws of his\u00a0 country in a situation which in general\u00a0 requires, that\u00a0 he should obey them.\u00a0 I was strongly inclined to think that where, in consequence of orders from\u00a0 the legitimate authority, a vessel is seized\u00a0 with pure intention, the claim of the injured party for damages would be against that government from which the orders proceeded, and would be a proper subject\u00a0 for negotiation.\u00a0 But I have been convinced that I was mistaken, and I have receded from\u00a0 this first opinion.\u00a0 I acquiesce in that of my brethren, which is, that\u00a0 the instructions can\u00a0 not change the nature of the transaction, or legalize an\u00a0 act which, without those instructions, would have been a plain trespass.\"<\/blockquote>The case cited is distinguishable from the case at\u00a0 bar in that in that case the duty to exercise judgment as to what vessels should be seized was placed, by express provisions of the law, upon the commander of the American warship. No duty whatever\u00a0 was placed upon the President\u00a0 of\u00a0 the United States.\u00a0\u00a0 Under the law he might, if he chose, give instructions to commanders of American war vessels to subject to examination any ship or vessel of the United\u00a0 States on the high seas which there might be reason to suspect was engaged in commerce contrary to the tenor of the law; but the duty of action,\u00a0 of using judgment and discretion as to whether or not a given ship was susceptible of seizure under said law, was placed\u00a0 wholly upon the commander of the vessel.\u00a0\u00a0 This appears from reading\u00a0 the\u00a0 Act.\u00a0\u00a0 Section\u00a0 5 thereof provides as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"That it shall be lawful for the President of the United States to give instructions to the commanders of the public armed ships\u00a0 of the United States to stop and examine any ship or vessel of the United\u00a0 States on the\u00a0 high\u00a0 seas which there may be reason to suspect to be engaged in any traffic or commerce contrary to the true tenor hereof; and if,\u00a0 upon examination, it shall\u00a0 appear that such ship or\u00a0 vessel is bound\u00a0 or\u00a0 sailing to any port or place within the territory of the French republic, or her dependencies, contrary to the intent of this Act, it shall be the duty of the commander of such public armed vessel to seize every such ship or vessel engaged in such illicit\u00a0 commerce, and send the same to the nearest port\u00a0 in\u00a0 the United States; and every such ship or vessel, thus bound or sailing to any such port or place, shall, upon\u00a0 due proof thereof, be liable to the like penalties and forfeitures as are provided in and by the\u00a0 first section of this Act.\"<\/blockquote>Under the\u00a0 law as quoted, the commander was acting for himself, upon his own\u00a0 responsibility.\u00a0\u00a0 He had no authority whatever from the President of the United\u00a0 States to act in a given way, or at a particular time, or upon\u00a0 a\u00a0 given ship, or upon a given set of facts.\u00a0 He was controlled\u00a0 entirely by the provisions of the law, not by the orders or instructions of the President.\u00a0 The source of his authority was the Act, not the President.\u00a0\u00a0 He was acting for himself, as principal, upon whom lay all of the obligation and all of the responsibility, and whose duties were clearly specified\u00a0 in the Act, and not\u00a0 as agent or servant\u00a0 of the\u00a0 President.\u00a0 He\u00a0 was acting in the performance of his own duty, and not in the performance\u00a0 of a duty laid upon the President of the United States.<br\/><br\/>In the case at bar no duty whatever was laid by law upon Harding or Trowbridge.\u00a0\u00a0 The only duty,\u00a0 if\u00a0 there was a duty in connection with the act performed, was laid upon the\u00a0 Governor-General\u00a0 personally.\u00a0\u00a0 If the law was as he supposed it to be, it was his duty and not\u00a0 their duty which they were performing.\u00a0 They acted not as principals upon whom an obligation was\u00a0 directly or indirectly laid by law. They were at\u00a0 the time merely the hands of the Governor- General.<br\/><br\/>The case of\u00a0 Tracy <i>vs<\/i>. Swartwout (10 Peters, 80), is distinguishable upon the same grounds.<br\/><br\/>In the case of Marbury<i> vs<\/i>. Madison (1 Cranch, 137), the court said (p. 164):<br\/><blockquote>\"By the Constitution of the United States the President is invested with\u00a0 certain important political powers,\u00a0 in the exercise of which he is to use his own discretion, and is accountable only to his country in his political character, and to his\u00a0 own conscience.\u00a0 To aid him in the performance of these duties, he\u00a0 is authorized to appoint certain officers, who act by his authority, and in conformity with his orders. In such cases, their acts are his acts; and whatever opinion may be entertained of the manner in which executive discretion may be used,\u00a0 still there exists,\u00a0 and can\u00a0 exist, no power to control that discretion.\u00a0\u00a0 The subjects are political: they respect the nation,\u00a0 not individual rights, and being entrusted to the\u00a0 executive, the decision of the executive is conclusive.\u00a0 The\u00a0 application\u00a0 of this remark will be perceived, by adverting to the Act of Congress for establishing the department of foreign affairs.\u00a0 This officer, as his duties were prescribed by that Act, is to conform precisely to the will of the President:\u00a0 he\u00a0 is the mere organ by whom that will\u00a0 is communicated.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 acts of such an officer,\u00a0 as an officer, can never be examinable by the courts.\u00a0 But when the legislature proceeds to\u00a0 impose on\u00a0 that\u00a0 officer\u00a0 other duties; when he is directed peremptorily to perform certain acts; when the rights\u00a0 of individuals are dependent\u00a0 on the performance of those acts; he is so far the officer of the law; is amenable to the laws for his conduct; and can not, at his discretion, sport away the vested rights of others.\"<\/blockquote>I do not discuss here the other citations\u00a0 made by the attorneys for the defendant\u00a0 for the reason that those authorities refer exclusively to the liability of executive officers of the Government occupying subordinate positions, who were creatures of the legislature and not of the constitution, and whose duties are specified by the law under which they acted and were by nature different from those laid upon the chief executive.\u00a0\u00a0 As we have distinctly stated heretofore, the rule of liability, herein set forth, applicable to the chief executive is not applied in this opinion to those occupying subordinate positions.\u00a0\u00a0 The principle of the nonliability\u00a0 of the chief executive rests\u00a0 in public policy.\u00a0 It\u00a0 is not held in this case that\u00a0 public\u00a0 policy reaches persons\u00a0 other than those who, in the highest sense, constitute the coordinate departments of the government.\u00a0 That question\u00a0 is not\u00a0 involved and is not discussed.<br\/><br\/>I have looked\u00a0 in vain for any logical reason which requires us to hold\u00a0 Harding and Trowbridge liable when the person whose act\u00a0 they\u00a0 were in reality performing is himself free from responsibility.<br\/><br\/><br\/><hr align=\"left\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> 15 Phil.

Tan Sam Tao declined and refused to\u00a0 exhibit it, and in consequence thereof was arrested by the said officer and brought before this court, where the complaint in this case was filed against him requesting the deportation of the said Tan Sam Tao\u00a0 from these Islands.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>The said Tan Sam Tao\u00a0 justifies his sojourn\u00a0 in the Philippines by alleging that he is a merchant, as\u00a0 defined by the Act of Congress for the\u00a0 exclusion of Chinese from the territory of the United States, which claim\u00a0 is disputed by the officers charged\u00a0 with administration of\u00a0 the\u00a0 provisions of the said Act in the Philippines.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>The said Tan\u00a0 Sam Tao is at the present time, and has been for more than ten years, a member of a firm\u00a0 having a fixed\u00a0 place of business,\u00a0 to wit, No. 27\u00a0 calle Nueva, Binondo, Manila.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>The said Tan Sam Tao is interested\u00a0 to the extent of P11,100\u00a0 of the\u00a0 capital\u00a0 of P40,900 invested\u00a0 in the\u00a0 said business among the six members, in the following manner:<\/li><\/ol><table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" width=\"75%\"> <tbody><tr> <td width=\"82%\">Tan Sam\u00a0\u00a0 Tao..........................................................................<\/td> <td width=\"18%\">P11,100<\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td>Tan\u00a0\u00a0 Sara\u00a0\u00a0 Chian.......................................................................\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/td> <td> 9,500<\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td>Tan Se\u00a0\u00a0 Ken...........................................................................\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/td> <td>6,600<\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td>Tan Bu\u00a0\u00a0 Ay.............................................................................\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/td> <td>4,500<\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td>Ching Suy\u00a0\u00a0 Hong.....................................................................\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/td> <td>5,200<\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td>Tan Sam\u00a0\u00a0 Juan.......................................................................\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/td> <td>4,000<\/td> <\/tr> <\/tbody><\/table><br\/><ol start=\"6\"><li>\u00a0The said Tan Sam Tao can prove these facts by two competent witnesses who do not belong to the Chinese race.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>Proof of the existence of the said firm, composed of the six members aforesaid, appears\u00a0 in the articles of incorporation, wherein\u00a0 it is set forth that the defendant is the owner of his\u00a0 share in his own name, and the same facts are to be found in the books of the firm.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>The said business consists of the purchase and sale to the public,\u00a0 by wholesale and retail, of textiles, under the firm name of \"Jap Jin,\" sometimes called\u00a0 \"Jap Jin &amp; Co.,\" which, translated into English, means \"United for prosperity.\"<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>The\u00a0 said Tan Sam\u00a0 Tao does not do\u00a0 nor has he done other manual labor than what is or was necessary in the said business to which he devotes himself exclusively.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>Neither the said Tan Sam Tao\u00a0 nor\u00a0 his firm are registered in the\u00a0 Mercantile Register, nor in the Bureau of Internal\u00a0 Revenue, but the\u00a0 license for the said\u00a0 business, issued by the Collector of Internal Revenue, is in the name of one of the other members of the said firm.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>The\u00a0 said business is\u00a0 established and carried\u00a0 on in accordance\u00a0 with the\u00a0 Chinese customs, the articles of incorporation being drawn up and the\u00a0 bookkeeping done in the Chinese language.<\/li><\/ol>From the facts thus stipulated, there can\u00a0 be no\u00a0 doubt that appellee is in fact a merchant, but the\u00a0 question submitted is whether from these facts he can be said to have conducted his business in his own name, so as to bring him under the definition of the term \"merchant\" as above set out.<br\/><br\/>This precise question was submitted and\u00a0 decided upon an\u00a0 agreed\u00a0 statement\u00a0 of facts\u00a0 substantially similar to the stipulation of\u00a0 facts above set out,\u00a0 by\u00a0 the\u00a0 Circuit\u00a0 Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (Lee Kan <i>vs.<\/i> U. S., 10 C. C. A., 669; 15 U. S. App., 516;\u00a0 62 Fed., 914) in an opinion delivered by Mr. Justice McKenna, then circuit judge, which was cited with approval by the\u00a0 Supreme Court of\u00a0 the United States in the cases of Tom Hong, Tom\u00a0 Dock and Lee Kit<i> vs.<\/i> U. S. (193 U. S., 517, 518), and\u00a0 in which, as observed by Justice Day in the latter cases,\u00a0 \"the subject was so fully\u00a0 considered as to leave little to\u00a0 be\u00a0 added to the discussion.\"<br\/><br\/>From this opinion\u00a0 we quote at length:<br\/><blockquote>\"To ascertain the\u00a0 meaning of Congress, the purpose of the Act as well as the language must be considered.\u00a0 The provisions of section 2, supra, are amendments to the Act of May 5, 1892, commonly called the 'Geary Act,' and they and the Act they amend are but steps in legislation to regulate and restrict the coming of Chinese laborers into the United States, and all provisions in regard to other classes are but means to that end.\u00a0 In interpreting' that legislation, this purpose has been steadily regarded, as by well-known canons of interpretation\u00a0 it must have been regarded, and the general language of the Acts confined to executing this purpose.\u00a0\u00a0 (<i>In re<\/i> Low Yam Chow, 13 Fed., 605.)\u00a0\u00a0 The sanction\u00a0 of these Acts is the treaty of November,\u00a0 1880, modifying that of 1868, except the Scott law, which, to its extent, abrogated the treaty; but this also was no exception to\u00a0 the purpose of the legislation, to wit,\u00a0 the exclusion\u00a0 of laborers.\u00a0 Besides, it was expressed in terms so irresistibly clear as\u00a0 to\u00a0 leave\u00a0 interpretation\u00a0 no\u00a0 function.\u00a0 The\u00a0 first article of the treaty of November,\u00a0 1880, provides that 'the Government\u00a0 of\u00a0 the United States\u00a0 may\u00a0 regulate,\u00a0 limit,\u00a0 or suspend the coming or residence of Chinese laborers to the United States, but may not absolutely prohibit it;' but the treaty also provides 'that\u00a0 the limitation or suspension shall be\u00a0 reasonable, and shall\u00a0 apply\u00a0 only to\u00a0 Chinese\u00a0 who\u00a0 may go\u00a0 to the\u00a0 United States\u00a0 as laborers, other classes not being included\u00a0 in the limitation.'\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, in the second article it\u00a0 is declared\u00a0 that 'Chinese subjects, whether\u00a0 proceeding to the United\u00a0 States as teachers, students, merchants, or from curiosity, together with their body or house-hold servants, and Chinese laborers who\u00a0 are\u00a0 now in the United States, shall be allowed to go and come of their own free will and\u00a0 accord,\u00a0 and shall be accorded all the rights, privileges, immunities, and exemptions which are accorded to the citizens and\u00a0 objects of the most favored\u00a0 nations.' The first Act after this treaty was that of May 6, 1882.\u00a0 It prohibited the coming\u00a0 of Chinese laborers for ten years, and contained provisions to secure the prohibition.\u00a0\u00a0 Among others, it provided, in section 6, that the identity of 'every Chinese person\u00a0 other than\u00a0 a laborer should be evidenced by a certificate\u00a0 issued under the authority of the Chinese Government.'\u00a0\u00a0 This Act came up for consideration\u00a0 before Justice Field, in the case of <i>In re<\/i> Low Yam Chow,<i> supra,<\/i> and he held that the 'section was\u00a0 evidently designed\u00a0 to facilitate proof by Chinese, other than laborers coming from China, and\u00a0 desiring to enter\u00a0 the United States.\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 * It is not required as a\u00a0 means\u00a0 of restricting\u00a0 their coming. To hold that such was its object would be to impute to Congress a purpose to disregard\u00a0 the stipulation\u00a0 of the second article of the new treaty that they should be allowed to go and come of their own\u00a0 free will and accord.'\u00a0 The learned justice also\u00a0 says:<br\/><br\/>\" 'And we will not assume, in the absence of plain language to the contrary, that Congress intended to disregard the obligation of the original treaty of 1868, which remains in full force except as modified by the supplementary treaty of 1880.'<br\/><br\/>\"This case and its language were approved by the United States Supreme\u00a0 Court in Lau Ow Bew <i>vs.<\/i> U. S. (144 U. S., 59, 12 Sup.\u00a0 Ct.,\u00a0 517), and other cases were there\u00a0 collected and commented\u00a0 on which sustain its\u00a0 principle.\u00a0 There\u00a0 is nothing in\u00a0 the\u00a0 Geary and the McCreary\u00a0 Acts which excludes\u00a0 them from the\u00a0 doctrine of these cases, or in any way includes merchants in\u00a0 the limitations or prohibitions on immigration.\u00a0 That we\u00a0 are right in this case is sustained by the explanation made by Mr. Geary in the House of Representatives when the McCreary bill was under consideration.\u00a0 The provisions of section 2, supra,\u00a0 were not contained in the bill reported by the\u00a0 Committee on Foreign Affairs.\u00a0\u00a0 They were moved as amendments by Mr. Geary, and in explanation of them he said:<br\/><br\/>\" 'There is one other definition that we think necessary. The treaty permits \"merchants\" to come into this country. We have no desire to restrict the movements of the mercantile class; but the trouble has been that men pretending to be merchants have asked\u00a0 for admission\u00a0 at New\u00a0 York and\u00a0 other\u00a0 places, have\u00a0 sworn\u00a0 that\u00a0 they\u00a0 had interest in stores established in those communities, have been admitted as merchants,\u00a0 and immediately developed\u00a0 into full-fledged laborers.\u00a0 We\u00a0 merely ask\u00a0 for a definition of the\u00a0 word \"merchant\" which shall\u00a0 be\u00a0 broad enough to protect every man\u00a0 legitimately\u00a0 engaged\u00a0 in\u00a0 that industry, and narrow enough to prevent the designation being used as an instrument of\u00a0 fraud by a class\u00a0 that we\u00a0 do not desire.\u00a0 This amendment\u00a0 requires every Chinaman asking to\u00a0 be admitted\u00a0 into the United\u00a0 States, and\u00a0 who\u00a0 claims\u00a0 to\u00a0 have formerly resided here, to prove that for at least one\u00a0 year, at some fixed place of business within\u00a0 the Union, he was engaged in buying and\u00a0 selling merchandise. We\u00a0 do not demand that he shall have\u00a0 a dollar's\u00a0 worth of stock, or a thousand dollars'\u00a0 worth; we\u00a0 simply\u00a0 follow\u00a0 the language of the\u00a0 treaty,\u00a0 and\u00a0 demand this\u00a0 protection\u00a0 to our own people.'<br\/><br\/>\"How efficient the amendment is for the purposes declared by Mr. Geary we shall hereafter\u00a0 show. It is incontestable that it was not directed at merchants\u00a0 any more than prior legislation was, or that it was\u00a0 not intended to regulate their methods of business, except so far as necessary to prevent evasions of the Act.\u00a0\u00a0 It was directed\u00a0 at laborers - to prevent\u00a0 them\u00a0 from assuming a false\u00a0 character.\u00a0\u00a0 To construe it otherwise is to make merchants its primary objects and subject them to a\u00a0 discrimination and inconvenience within\u00a0 the country to which no other merchants are subjected.\u00a0 It would not only forbid them to do business as it is their custom to do, but to do business as it\u00a0 is the custom of all commercial people to do. It is\u00a0 stipulated in this case that the designation of the firm of which petitioner is a member was\u00a0 selected in\u00a0 accordance with a custom which has prevailed\u00a0 from time immemorial among the Chinese, and expresses a propitious\u00a0 omen, and means, when\u00a0 literally rendered in English, 'everlasting,'\u00a0 'great,' 'bountiful.'\u00a0\u00a0 But, as stated by counsel, the custom is not exclusive with\u00a0 Chinese.\u00a0 It prevails\u00a0 with\u00a0 other\u00a0 people, and the Bon Marche of Paris, and the Golden Rule Bazaar of this city were cited, among others, as examples.\u00a0\u00a0 These designate, as the name Wing Tai Lung designates, a house rather than a firm, and expresses the\u00a0 sentiment and principle which shall govern its dealings.\u00a0 It might be better if the\u00a0 practice were more general.\u00a0 The construction contended for by the Government would\u00a0 not\u00a0 only forbid the Chinese\u00a0 this practice,\u00a0 but forbid them,\u00a0 as we have said, the common practice of this country, and of all commercial countries.\u00a0 The designations of very few\u00a0 business houses contain the names of all of the partners.\u00a0\u00a0 One or two are usually named,\u00a0 and the others are not named,\u00a0 but only their\u00a0 existence\u00a0 indicated\u00a0 by the addition\u00a0 'and company.' We can\u00a0 not believe that Congress\u00a0 intended to forbid to Chinese\u00a0 merchants, not only their own\u00a0 customs,\u00a0 but the custom of merchants wherever trading is\u00a0 practiced.\u00a0 But we construe section 2\u00a0 to\u00a0 mean\u00a0 that\u00a0 the\u00a0 interest\u00a0 of the merchant must\u00a0 be\u00a0 real, and appear in\u00a0 the business and partnership articles in his own\u00a0 name, and not that his name\u00a0 must appear in the firm designation.\u00a0 And this reaches the evil which existed.\u00a0\u00a0 It was not complained that the firm designation was a cover to deception.\u00a0 According to the stipulation, it could not be in many cases.\u00a0 It contained no name to claim.\u00a0\u00a0 It was complained that\u00a0 an interest was claimed which stood in a name other than the claimant's, and that the ownership was established\u00a0 by Chinese testimony.\u00a0 Section\u00a0 2 prevented this, and\u00a0 required name and ownership\u00a0 to go together, and to be established\u00a0 by the testimony of credible witnesses other than Chinese.\u00a0 This view is\u00a0 confirmed\u00a0 by considerations\u00a0 drawn from other sections of the Act. The definition of 'merchant' is general.\u00a0 The provision of section\u00a0 2\u00a0 is:<br\/><br\/>\"'The\u00a0 term merchant employed herein and in the Acts of which this Act is\u00a0 amendatory shall\u00a0 have the following meaning, and none other.'<br\/><br\/>\"The definition is\u00a0 then\u00a0 given\u00a0 as hereinbefore stated. Section 6\u00a0 requires all\u00a0 Chinese laborers to register, the penalty of refusal being deportation from the country.\u00a0 All who are not merchants\u00a0 within the requirements of the definition (excluding, of\u00a0 course,\u00a0 certain\u00a0 privileged classes) are laborers;\u00a0 hence the definition applies not only to the merchant\u00a0 who claims to\u00a0 enter the United\u00a0 States, having formerly been here, but to him who stayed and while he stays.<br\/><br\/>\"The interpretation of\u00a0 the Government makes the law forbid him to stay as a merchant and do business as he formerly did, and to what\u00a0 end?\u00a0\u00a0 That he may be deported? No one desires it.\u00a0 That he may be compelled to register as a laborer?\u00a0\u00a0 A useless compulsion.\u00a0 And, to accomplish an undesired\u00a0 or useless\u00a0 result, we are asked to attribute to Congress an\u00a0 intention to\u00a0 change the business methods of many\u00a0 people,\u00a0 and to\u00a0 compel them to adopt inconvenient and, maybe, impracticable ones.\u00a0 Chief Justice Fuller, delivering the opinion of the court in Lau Ow Bew <i>vs.<\/i> U. S., <i>supra,<\/i> said:<br\/><br\/>\"'Nothing\u00a0 is better\u00a0 settled\u00a0 than\u00a0 that\u00a0 statutes should receive a sensible construction, such as will effectuate the legislative\u00a0 intention,\u00a0 and, if possible,\u00a0 so as to\u00a0 avoid an unjust or\u00a0 an\u00a0 absurd\u00a0 conclusion.'<br\/><br\/>\"And the\u00a0 learned\u00a0 Chief\u00a0 Justice cites\u00a0 Church\u00a0 of\u00a0 Holy Trinity <i>vs<\/i>. U. S. (143 U.\u00a0 S., 457, 12\u00a0 Sup. Ct, 511) ;\u00a0 Henderson vs. Mayor (92\u00a0 U. S., 259) ; U. S.\u00a0 <i>vs<\/i>. Kirby (7 Wall., 482);\u00a0 Oates\u00a0 <i>vs<\/i>. Bank\u00a0 (100 U. S., 239).\u00a0 This is a wise canon\u00a0 of construction.\u00a0 By it language general\u00a0 enough to include other things is confined to the purpose of the lawmakers, securing it and\u00a0 avoiding confusion and disappointment, and often absurdity.\u00a0 Illustrating this canon, Justice Field, in the case of Ah Tie (13 Fed., 294), said:<br\/><br\/>\"'So the judges of England construed the\u00a0 law which enacted that\u00a0 a prisoner breaking prison should be deemed guilty of felony, holding that it did not apply to one breaking\u00a0 out\u00a0 when the prison was on fire, observing that the prisoner was \"not to be hanged because he would not stay to be burnt.\"\u00a0 And, in illustration\u00a0 of this doctrine, the construction given to the Bolognian law against drawing blood in the street is often cited.\u00a0 That law enacted that whoever thus\u00a0 drew\u00a0 blood\u00a0 should be\u00a0 punished with the utmost severity, but the courts held that it did not extend to the surgeon who\u00a0 opened the vein of a person\u00a0 falling down in\u00a0 the streets in a fit.'<br\/><br\/>\"And the learned justice, <i>In re<\/i> Low Yam Chow, <i>supra,<\/i> gave two additional\u00a0 illustrations\u00a0 taken from decisions of the Supreme Court:<br\/><br\/>\"'A law of Congress declares\u00a0 that whoever\u00a0 willfully obstructs or retards the carrier of the mails of the\u00a0 United States shall be deemed guilty\u00a0 of\u00a0 a\u00a0 public offense, and be punished by a\u00a0 fine.\u00a0\u00a0 A mail carrier\u00a0 in Kentucky was arrested by the sheriff upon a charge of murder, and for the arrest the\u00a0 sheriff was indicted.\u00a0 The Supreme\u00a0 Court held that the\u00a0 general language of the Act of Congress was not to be construed to extend to the case;\u00a0 for it could not be supposed that Congress intended to interfere with the enforcement\u00a0 of the criminal laws of the\u00a0 State in its legislation\u00a0 to prevent unnecessary obstruction in the carriage of the mails.\u00a0 It would have been absurd to hold that, in order to secure the speedy transportation of the mails, immunity from punishment for\u00a0 a crime was given to the mail carrier. (U.\u00a0 S.<i> vs. <\/i> Kirby,\u00a0 7\u00a0 Wall.,\u00a0 482.)\u00a0\u00a0 So the Act of Congress for the recovery of the proceeds of captured and abandoned property during the late war required the claimant in the Court of Claims to prove that he had\u00a0 never given\u00a0 aid or comfort to the\u00a0 rebellion; yet the Supreme Court held that one who\u00a0 had been pardoned by the President was relieved from this requirement.\u00a0 The general language of the Act covered his case,\u00a0 but, as the pardon in legal effect blotted out the guilt of the\u00a0 offender - that\u00a0 is, closed the eyes\u00a0 of the court so that it could not\u00a0 be considered as an element in the determination of his case - the\u00a0 pardon was deemed to take the place of the proof, and relieved\u00a0 him from the necessity of establishing his loyalty.\u00a0 \"It is not to be supposed,\" said the Supreme Court, \"that Congress intended by the language of the Act to encroach\u00a0 upon any of the prerogatives of the President, and especially that benign prerogative of mercy which lies\u00a0 in the\u00a0 pardoning power. It is more reasonable to conclude that claimants restored to their rights of property by the pardon of\u00a0 the President were not in contemplation of Congress in passing the Act, and were not intended to be embraced by\u00a0 the requirement in question.\u00a0 All general terms in statutes should be limited in\u00a0 their\u00a0 application\u00a0 so\u00a0 as\u00a0 not to\u00a0 lead\u00a0 to injustice, oppression, or any unconstitutional\u00a0 operation, if that be possible.\u00a0\u00a0 It will be presumed that exceptions were intended which would avoid results of that nature.\"\u00a0\u00a0 Carlisle <i>vs.<\/i> U. S., 16 Wall., 153.)'<br\/><br\/>\"And the learned justice said, virtually, that these cases would have justified him\u00a0 in\u00a0 restricting\u00a0 section 6 of\u00a0 the Act of 1882 to merchants\u00a0 coming from China, even if the general term used in the section were\u00a0 susceptible of a larger meaning.\u00a0\u00a0 Undoubtedly, if the purpose of the Act had been a limitation on the immigration of merchants, as it was of laborers, its language would have applied to their coming from everywhere.\u00a0 There\u00a0 can be no temptation, in order to secure the exclusion of Chinese\u00a0 laborers,\u00a0 to\u00a0 give a\u00a0 strained construction to section 2.\u00a0\u00a0 As we construe\u00a0 it, it is entirely sufficient, and completely fulfills the objects of the legislation.\u00a0 It does not disturb real merchants\u00a0 in the privileges guaranteed\u00a0 by the treaty,\u00a0 and it prevents false\u00a0 ones from\u00a0 claiming\u00a0 them.\u00a0 It makes the definition of the word\u00a0 'merchant' that which Mr. Geary aptly\u00a0 said it was\u00a0 intended\u00a0 to be - 'broad enough to protect every man legitimately\u00a0 engaged in\u00a0 that industry,\u00a0 and narrow enough\u00a0 to prevent the\u00a0 designation being used as an\u00a0 instrument of fraud by a class that we do not desire.'\u00a0\u00a0 The burden of proof is on the person seeking to land, and the character of the facts which he must prove, the time which they must have existed, and the witnesses by whom proved, together with the possibilities of counter proof inevitably suggested, make deception impossible,\u00a0 except under a\u00a0 very negligent administration of the law.\u00a0\u00a0 A place in the\u00a0 firm name would not prevent this, nor is it to be apprehended.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The reasoning and authority of the foregoing decision, accepted and approved by the Supreme Court of the United States, is clearly decisive of the\u00a0 issue\u00a0 involved in this appeal, and renders further discussion wholly superfluous.<br\/><br\/>It is proper, nevertheless, to direct attention to the decisions of this court in the cases of the U.\u00a0 S. vs. Sy Quiat (12 Phil. Rep., 676) and U. S. <i>vs. <\/i>Lim Co\u00a0 (12 Phil. Rep., 703), in each of which we held the defendant not to be a \"merchant\" as that term is\u00a0 employed in the Act under consideration, the\u00a0 evidence not sustaining the claim of the defendant that he owned an\u00a0 interest in\u00a0 a certain store as alleged by him, or that his name was included in\u00a0 any partnership agreement touching the ownership of that store, and\u00a0 it affirmatively appearing that the store\u00a0 in question was\u00a0 conducted in the individual name\u00a0 of a Chinese person other than the defendant.\u00a0 Upon\u00a0 the facts thus found these decisions were clearly correct, and are in nowise in\u00a0 conflict\u00a0 with the reasoning of the decision in\u00a0 the\u00a0 case of Lee Kan <i>vs<\/i>.\u00a0 U. S., above cited and adopted as\u00a0 its own by\u00a0 this court.<br\/><br\/>In support of our ruling in\u00a0 those cases, we cited a number of decisions of the Federal courts, and among others we quoted at length from the\u00a0 case U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Quan Gin\u00a0\u00a0 (61 Fed. Rep., 395), which\u00a0 goes much farther than was necessary for the purposes of our decisions\u00a0 in the former cases; and\u00a0 is in direct conflict with the later decisions\u00a0 of\u00a0 the Supreme Court\u00a0 of the United States\u00a0 above\u00a0 cited,\u00a0 in so far as it holds\u00a0 that the mere fact that\u00a0 the\u00a0 name of a Chinese\u00a0 person\u00a0 is not\u00a0 included in the firm name of\u00a0 the business in which he claims to be a\u00a0 partner is sufficient ground to\u00a0 sustain a holding that the\u00a0 business is not conducted \"in his own\u00a0 name,\" as that phrase is used in the statute defining the\u00a0 word \"merchant.\"<br\/><br\/>The rule laid down in the Quan Gin case\u00a0 (<i>supra<\/i>) was not necessarily drawn in question\u00a0 by the\u00a0 facts proven in the Sy Quiat and Lim Co cases, and the only proper bearing of the Quan Gin case on those cases was to show, when taken\u00a0 together\u00a0 with the other Federal cases cited, that the Federal courts\u00a0 have uniformly held that proof that one is a \"merchant\" as that term\u00a0 is used1 in the Chinese-exclusion Acts is incomplete without proof that the alleged merchant conducts his business under his own name.\u00a0 The quotation from that case, however, setting out as it does the objectionable rule, doubtless was calculated to mislead those interested, and\u00a0 we are\u00a0 glad to avail\u00a0 ourselves\u00a0 of this opportunity to correct\u00a0 any mistaken inference which may have\u00a0 been\u00a0 drawn\u00a0 from the fact that this quotation appears\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 body of the opinion,\u00a0 without an express disavowal of the rule.\u00a0\u00a0 The rule itself not being necessary to the decisions in\u00a0 the Sy\u00a0 Quiat\u00a0 and Lim Co\u00a0 cases was not given\u00a0 the consideration which it would\u00a0 have had if it had been necessary for the purpose of those cases\u00a0 to adopt or reject it, and, indeed, the attention of the court and of the writer of the opinions\u00a0 in\u00a0 those\u00a0 cases, who is also the writer of this opinion, was not directed to the Lee Kan case <i>(supra)<\/i> and the case in the Supreme Court\u00a0 of the United\u00a0 States adopting the reasoning of that case\u00a0 (193 U.

The\u00a0 plaintiffs built the fence a second time and, in order to prevent the governor from consummating his threat of again tearing it down, commenced this action of prohibition, obtaining a preliminary\u00a0 injunction in aid\u00a0 of the\u00a0 suit.\u00a0\u00a0 The provincial\u00a0 board seemed\u00a0 to base its\u00a0 claim of right to open the alleged street not only upon the ground that\u00a0 it was a public highway, but also\u00a0 upon the ground that\u00a0 the closing of\u00a0 the same\u00a0 in the\u00a0 manner\u00a0 in which it was done by the plaintiffs stopped or impeded\u00a0 the flow of surface waters to the bay, and retained them within\u00a0 the limits of the\u00a0 village\u00a0 to become stagnant and\u00a0 foul, to\u00a0 the prejudice of the health of the community.<br\/><br\/>It is immaterial, in the decision\u00a0 of this action, who owns the land in question.\u00a0\u00a0 The result is the same whether it is a public highway or not.\u00a0 The real question is whether or not the provincial board of the Province of Cavite\u00a0 had any authority or jurisdiction to order torn down the fence erected by the plaintiffs,\u00a0 even\u00a0 conceding\u00a0 the way to\u00a0 be a public highway.\u00a0\u00a0 A careful examination of the statute which gives functions and powers to the provincial governor and board discloses clearly that such governor and board had no authority to pass the resolution which they did pass or to commit the act which they\u00a0 did commit,\u00a0 even conceding that the way in question was\u00a0 a public highway.\u00a0\u00a0 Neither did they or either of them have the power or authority to close the alleged street\u00a0 for reasons of public health.\u00a0 The only provisions of law respecting the powers of provincial boards which relate to\u00a0 public highways or public\u00a0 health are the following:<br\/><blockquote>\"It shall be the duty of the provincial board - <br\/><br\/>\"To order, in\u00a0 its discretion, the construction, repair, or maintenance of roads, bridges, and ferries within the portions of the\u00a0 province fixed as within its control on the recommendation\u00a0 of the district engineer, and to approve or reject contracts for such construction\u00a0 and repair, and the construction and repair of provincial buildings.<br\/><br\/>\"To agree upon\u00a0 the recommendation of the district engineer with the provincial board of an adjoining province on the terms within the limitations of law, upon\u00a0 which roads forming the\u00a0 boundary\u00a0 between\u00a0 the\u00a0 two provinces,\u00a0 and bridges and ferries crossing streams forming such boundary shall be constructed,\u00a0 repaired, or\u00a0 maintained\u00a0 under the joint control of the two provincial governments.<br\/><br\/>\"To appropriate,\u00a0 in its discretion, moneys from any of its funds in excess of all just-debts and liabilities falling due within the fiscal year, except those funds the use of\u00a0 which is otherwise specifically\u00a0 fixed by\u00a0 law,\u00a0 for loans to municipalities of\u00a0 the province, under such\u00a0 conditions as to the use of the funds loaned\u00a0 and as to the repayment of the loans with interest at three per centum per annum, as may be fixed by the provincial board: Provided, That the\u00a0 entire indebtedness of any municipality\u00a0 to which a loan is made shall\u00a0 not, inclusive\u00a0 of such loan, exceed five per centum of the assessed valuation of the property\u00a0 in said municipality.<br\/><br\/>\"To provide, in its discretion, for the payment from provincial\u00a0 funds of their regular compensation during the period of their disability, not exceeding ninety days, to unclassified employees of the provincial government, including laborers, when said employees or laborers are injured\u00a0 in the clear\u00a0 line of duty;

As a result of the assault the women received various slight bruises and suffered bodily pains.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, and in view of the preliminary investigation had in the justice of the peace court of Gerona, before which the offended woman made complaint, the provincial fiscal filed an information with the Court of First Instance of Tarlac, on August 5 of that year, charging Cristobal Paray with the crime of forcible entry, and the case having come to trial, the judge, upon evidence adduced therein, sentenced the defendant to the penalty of two years and five months of<i> prision correccional<\/i>, to the accessory penalties, to pay a fine of 325 pesetas and, in case of insolvency, to suffer the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment, and to the payment of the costs, allowing him credit for one-half the previous detention served by him. From this judgment the defendant appealed to this court.<br\/><br\/>From the facts hereinbefore related, and which were conclusively proved in this cause, it is concluded that the crime of forcible entry was actually committed, qualified by acts of violence performed against the persons of the inmates of the house, for, notwithstanding the opposition of the latter and their express prohibition to him not to enter the house, on their seeing him approach the stairs in a furious manner with the intention of mounting, he at the same time threatening them with death, and notwithstanding the fact that the offended parties, on seeing the determination of the accused, closed the door, yet withal Cristobal Paray entered the house by violently pushing against the door and, after having succeeded in entering, even maltreated the said inmates by slapping and kicking them; all of which acts constitute the crime before specified, which is provided for and punished by article 491, paragraph 2, of the Penal Code.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This article is of the following tenor:<br\/><blockquote>\"Any private individual who shall enter another's dwelling against the will of the tenant thereof shall be punished with <i>arresto mayo<\/i>r and a fine of from 325 to 3,250 pesetas.<br\/><br\/>\"If the deed were committed with violence or intimidation, the penalty shall be <i>prision correccional<\/i> in its medium and maximum degree and a fine of from 325 to 3,250 pesetas.\"<\/blockquote>Notwithstanding the denial of the accused and his exculpatory allegations, which, though accorded faith, would not weaken the force of the accusation nor the certainty of the criminal act, it is unquestionable that the cause furnishes conclusive proof of the guilt of the accused as the sole proved perpetrator by direct participation of the crime under prosecution, for he knowingly violated the aforesaid provision of the law which prohibits a person from passing across another's threshold against the owner's will, lest one of the most sacred personal rights of all those recognized by law be wantonly disregarded. The only limitation upon this prohibition is that provided for in the following article 492 of the same code and the necessary power of due inspection which pertains to the sovereign authority and to its representatives.<br\/><br\/>The accused was warned by the women, the inmates of the house, that he should not climb the stairs of nor enter the same, and, confirming the prohibition which they had communicated to him a few moments before, they had shut the entrance door of the house and so held it from the inside; but the accused, determined to execute his criminal purpose, with manifest disregard of the rights of the offended parties, violently entered the house and, what was still more, maltreated them without any right whatever to do so, which acts of violence qualify the crime and determine the imposition of a severer penalty, though in applying the same it is proper to make an allowance in favor of the accused on account of the attendance of the special circumstance provided for in article 11 of the Penal Code, due to his scant education, without any aggravating circumstance to counterbalance its effects.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons and esteeming the judgment appealed from to be accordant with the law, it is proper, in our opinion, to affirm and we hereby affirm the same with the costs against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Arellano, C.

that there resulted from\u00a0 the\u00a0 examination a shortage of P53.05 in the cash of the municipal treasury; that at the moment when the difference was discovered he notified the treasurer of it, and the latter took the sum of P53.05 from his pocket and paid it, but he did\u00a0 not remember, however, whether he\u00a0 had questioned the\u00a0 treasurer as\u00a0 to why the amount was not in the safe; and\u00a0 that, at the time when the examination was made, there\u00a0 were other persons present, to wit, the municipal president and the municipal secretary.<br\/><br\/>When the above witnesses were examined, the first named stated that they were\u00a0 called\u00a0 by the deputy auditor at the commencement of\u00a0 the examination in order to witness the same, and he remembered that there was a deficit of some fifty-odd\u00a0 pesos\u00a0 and that the treasurer at once paid the money that was lacking, taking the\u00a0 same out of his own pocket.\u00a0 The second witness stated that he was not present at the commencement of the examination, and that it was only\u00a0 when the\u00a0 shortage was discovered that the deputy auditor called him\u00a0 in to bear witness thereto; that, as he remembered, it\u00a0 amounted to more than P50; that what he did see was that the shortage was at once covered by the treasurer,\u00a0 Mariano\u00a0 Feliciano,\u00a0 who\u00a0\u00a0 took\u00a0 the necessary amount from his pocket.<br\/><br\/>The accused being placed on the stand testified that\u00a0 an examination of the cash and accounts kept by him as municipal treasurer was made on the 20th of May, 1908, and that when the examiner called his attention to the fact that there was a shortage of some\u00a0 79-odd pesos,\u00a0 he told\u00a0 the latter that there was more money in a small box in the safe,\u00a0 which was true, as the\u00a0 examiner has certified; that subsequently the latter observed\u00a0 that even with this there was still money lacking,\u00a0 and the witness then recalled that he had money in his desk representing the\u00a0 remainder\u00a0 of certain payments for wages\u00a0 of\u00a0 laborers, which money\u00a0 he also presented to the examiner, but the latter in his report stated that said money was not\u00a0 in the safe and that\u00a0 the cash\u00a0 was short.\u00a0 In explaining why\u00a0 this money was not in the safe, he said that it was destined to pay wages on the previous Saturday, but that as all the laborers had not appeared to collect\u00a0 their\u00a0 wages he kept it in\u00a0 his desk, and it remained there\u00a0 because he had begun to prepare\u00a0 his report for the ten-day period.<br\/><br\/>Section 2 of Act\u00a0 No. 1740 provides that - \"Any failure or inability of\u00a0 such person to produce all the funds and property properly in his charge on\u00a0 the demand of any officer authorized to examine or inspect such person, office, treasury, or depositary shall be deemed to be <i>prima facie<\/i> evidence that such missing funds or property have been put to personal uses or\u00a0 used\u00a0 for personal\u00a0 ends by such person within the meaning\u00a0 of the previous section.\"<br\/><br\/>If, according to the officer who made the examination of the accounts,\u00a0 at the very moment when the shortage\u00a0 of P53 was discovered\u00a0 and the treasurer was notified\u00a0 he\u00a0 at once presented the money, no <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">prima facie <\/span>evidence of the crime of misappropriation can be established, nor any proof whatever that there was such misappropriation.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, the judgment appealed from is hereby reversed with the costs of both instances <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">de oficio.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/span>So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i> Torres, Mapa, Johnson,\u00a0 Carson, Moreland,<\/i> and<i> Elliott, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><br\/><br\/><hr align=\"left\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> Page 142, <i>supra.<\/i><br\/><\/div>",

Macleod is joined as plain tiff only for the reason that he is the husband of Mercedes Martinez and he takes no part in the action personally.<br\/><br\/>In the statement of facts and some of the legal propositions\u00a0 involved, we have made free use of the forms contained in the briefs of both parties.<br\/><br\/>Alejandro S. Macleod was for many years the managing partner of the house of Aldecoa &amp; Co. in the city of Manila. He withdrew from the management on the\u00a0 31st day\u00a0 of December, 1906, when Aldecoa &amp; Co. went into liquidation. At the time that Aldecoa\u00a0 &amp; Co. ceased active business the Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation was a creditor of that firm to the extent of several hundred thousand pesos and claimed to\u00a0 have\u00a0 a\u00a0 creditor's lien\u00a0 in\u00a0 the nature of a pledge over certain properties of the\u00a0 debtor.\u00a0 In April, 1907,\u00a0 the bank\u00a0 began a civil action against\u00a0 Alejandro\u00a0 S. Macleod, his wife,\u00a0 Mercedes Martinez, Aldecoa &amp; Co., and the firm known as Viuda 6 Hijos de Escano.\u00a0 In the bank's complaint it was alleged that a certain undertaking in favor of Aldecoa &amp; Co.\u00a0 had been hypothecated\u00a0 to\u00a0 the bank\u00a0 to secure the indebtedness of Aldecoa &amp;\u00a0 Co,, but that this obligation had been wrongfully transferred by Alejandro S. Macleod into an\u00a0 obligation in favor of his wife, Mercedes Martinez, to the prejudice of the bank.\u00a0\u00a0 In May,\u00a0 1907, Aldecoa &amp; Co. began a civil action against\u00a0 Alejandro\u00a0 S. Macleod\u00a0 and others for the recovery of certain shares\u00a0 of stock\u00a0 of the par value of P161,000 and for damages in the sum of P150,000, basing its right to recover upon alleged criminal\u00a0 misconduct of Mr. Macleod in his management\u00a0 of the firm's affairs.<br\/><br\/>When\u00a0 the two causes of action above referred to were discovered and the suits there mentioned commenced, Alejandro S. Macleod\u00a0 and Mercedes\u00a0 Martinez,\u00a0 his wife, engaged the services of Messrs. Del-Pan,\u00a0 Ortigas and Fisher, attorneys at law,\u00a0 to represent\u00a0 and defend\u00a0 them\u00a0 in the matter.\u00a0 Soon thereafter\u00a0 these attorneys made overtures to the liquidator of Aldecoa &amp; Co. for the settlement of the latter's claims.\u00a0 While these negotiations were pending Aldecoa\u00a0 &amp; Co. claimed that they\u00a0 had made discoveries of many\u00a0 frauds which Macleod had perpetrated against the company during the\u00a0 period of his management, whereby the company had been defrauded of many thousands of pesos.<br\/><br\/>On the 13th day of July, 1907, it becoming apparent that criminal proceedings would be instituted against him, Macleod went from Manila to the Portuguese colony of Macao, a\u00a0 territory not\u00a0 covered, it appears,\u00a0 by extradition treaty between the United States and the Portuguese Government. Four days thereafter, on the 17th day of July, Aldecoa &amp; Co. filed a complaint against\u00a0 Mr. Macleod, charging him with the\u00a0 falsification of\u00a0 a commercial document,\u00a0 and a warrant for his arrest was issued by the Court of First Instance of Manila, and the executive department of the Philippine Government issued\u00a0 a formal\u00a0 request to the\u00a0 Portuguese authorities for the extradition of the accused.\u00a0 This request was denied.\u00a0 In the meantime the attorneys for the respective parties were engaged in negotiations for the\u00a0 settlement and compromise of the differences then pending and a\u00a0 clearance of Mr. Macleod from all claims and demands of his\u00a0 creditors.\u00a0 Aldecoa &amp; Co.\u00a0 and the bank, as\u00a0 a\u00a0 consideration for such settlement, insisted upon the conveyance not only of all the property of Alejandro\u00a0 S. Mecleod\u00a0 but also of at least\u00a0 a portion of the\u00a0 property claimed by his wife, the plaintiff herein.\u00a0 The settlement offered at that time was\u00a0 the same which was subsequently accepted and consummated on the 14th of August as shown by Exhibit A.\u00a0 There\u00a0 appears to have been\u00a0 little\u00a0 resistance to\u00a0 this demand on the part of the representatives of Mr. Macleod, but his wife, the plaintiff\u00a0 herein, stoutly objected to\u00a0 the conveyance required of her, maintaining that the property which she was asked to\u00a0 transfer was her separate and\u00a0 exclusive property and not liable for\u00a0 the debts of her husband. Her position was fully stated by\u00a0 her to her attorney, Mr. Fisher, and to her attorney-in-fact, Mr. William Macleod. An interview between her attorney\u00a0 and the attorney\u00a0 for Aldecoa &amp; Co. followed this declaration on her part.\u00a0 Thereafter and on the night of August 4 another interview was had between the plaintiff and her counsel, Mr. Fisher, and others, at which a long list of claims against Mr. Macleod, prepared\u00a0 by Aldecoa &amp; Co., was\u00a0 exhibited to the plaintiff and its contents explained to her by Mr. Fisher and her attorney-in-fact.\u00a0 Some of these\u00a0 claims involved criminal as well as civil liability.\u00a0 Mr. Fisher at that time favored a settlement in accordance with the terms proposed by Aldecoa &amp; Co.\u00a0 The plaintiff, however, refused to accept such settlement.<br\/><br\/>This being the state of affairs, one of the attorneys for the bank, on the 7th day of August, 1907, was called upon by counsel for both Aldecoa &amp; Co. and the plaintiff\u00a0 in this action,\u00a0 who requested him to act\u00a0 as intermediary between the parties\u00a0 and to\u00a0 suggest means by\u00a0 which a settlement could be obtained.\u00a0 At that interview it was agreed that a full explanation of the condition of affairs should be made to Mr. Kingcome, a son-in-law of the plaintiff and a business man.\u00a0 This\u00a0 explanation was made by Mr. Stephen, manager of the\u00a0 Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation, one of the friends of Mr. Kingcome, at an\u00a0 interview\u00a0 arranged between them pursuant to the arrangements made\u00a0 by the attorneys\u00a0 for the parties.\u00a0 Whether or not Mr. Kingcome communicated the substance of that interview with Mr. Stephen to\u00a0 his mother-in-law, the plaintiff, before she signed the document in question is in dispute in this case. There\u00a0 is some doubt from\u00a0 the record as to the exact language\u00a0 used\u00a0 in\u00a0 this\u00a0 conversation\u00a0 between\u00a0 Kingcome and Stephen, but it appears that\u00a0 some reference was made\u00a0 to the interest\u00a0 which the\u00a0 British colony in Manila, of which Messrs. Stephen, Kingcome, and Macleod were prominent members,\u00a0 would have in avoiding\u00a0 the scandal and disgrace to the\u00a0 latter which might be expected\u00a0 to ensue unless the differences between the parties to this action were\u00a0 amicably arranged.\u00a0 It seems at that\u00a0 interview that\u00a0 Mr. Stephen suggested to Mr. Kingcome that he advise his mother-in-law to\u00a0 act reasonably in\u00a0 negotiating the proposed settlement. It appears that Mr. Kingcome got the impression from that interview that Mr. Stephen thought\u00a0 unless the\u00a0 settlement were consummated additional and mortifying misfortunes would fall upon Mr. Macleod's family.<br\/><br\/>About the time\u00a0 that the interview between\u00a0 Kingcome and Stephen was celebrated Mr.. Fisher\u00a0 was enlisting the services of Mr. William Macleod, a nephew and close friend of plaintiff and her husband, and plaintiff's attorney-in-fact, for a mission to plaintiff of a similar character\u00a0 to that of Mr. Kingcome.\u00a0 Mr. William MacleQd, as well as Mr. Kingcome,\u00a0 seems to\u00a0 have been persuaded\u00a0 by\u00a0 what he was told that the\u00a0 consequences\u00a0 of plaintiff's\u00a0 continued\u00a0 refusal to make the settlement would be disastrous to\u00a0 Alejandro S. Macleod and his family and would be\u00a0 an\u00a0 exhibition of very bad judgment in every way.<br\/><br\/>On August 9, 1907, the prosecuting attorney filed a second complaint against Alejandro S. Macleod\u00a0 and his associate, Osorio, charging them with\u00a0 embezzlement\u00a0 and\u00a0 causing warrants of extradition to issue.\u00a0 The complaint was made at the instance of the prosecuting attorney because he had heard\u00a0 that\u00a0 Maeleod and Osorio were about\u00a0 to\u00a0 leave\u00a0 for Europe and he wanted to intercept them\u00a0 in territory from which they could be extradited.<br\/><br\/>On the 11th of August a long conference was held between plaintiff, her attorney, Mr. Kingcome, her son-in-law, and William Macleod, her\u00a0 attorney-in-fact, at which she was informed in substance\u00a0 that if\u00a0 she\u00a0 assented to the requirements of Aldecoa &amp;\u00a0 Co. and the bank the\u00a0 civil suits against herself and her husband would be dismissed and the criminal charges against him withdrawn, while if she\u00a0 refused her husband must either spend the rest of his life in Macao or be criminally prosecuted on the charges already filed and to be filed. At that interview plaintiff\u00a0 refused\u00a0 to\u00a0 accede to the terms\u00a0 of settlement and that interview was terminated by a statement on the part of Mr. Fisher,\u00a0 which was \"Gentlemen, it is\u00a0 evident that there can be no compromise or\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 settlement, and the only thing left us to do is to defend Mr. Macleod in the best possible manner.\"<br\/><br\/>On the 12th of August, at an interview had between the plaintiff and her attorney-in-fact, Mr. William Macleod, the plaintiff acceded to the terms proposed by the defendants and authorized Mr. William Macleod to execute the contract of settlement\u00a0 on her behalf.\u00a0 The document of settlement was prepared and after\u00a0 certain corrections upon the part of the plaintiff's attorneys, making the same entirely satisfactory to them, it was signed by the plaintiff's attorney-in- fact on her behalf on the 14th of August.\u00a0\u00a0 It was thereafter and on the same day ratified by the plaintiff, who executed the same in person.<br\/><br\/>After\u00a0 Aldecoa &amp; Co. and the bank\u00a0 had taken possession of the property of plaintiff and her husband, conveyed to them by Exhibit\u00a0 A, the civil\u00a0 suits\u00a0 were dismissed, the criminal\u00a0 charges\u00a0 withdrawn, and Mr.\u00a0 Macleod returned from Macao to Manila.\u00a0 The plaintiff had a surveyor divide the property in Malate, of which\u00a0 she had\u00a0 conveyed a half interest, into two equal parts.\u00a0 She negotiated for a partition of the\u00a0 land on the\u00a0 basis of this survey.\u00a0 She joined in the\u00a0 motion\u00a0 for the dismissal of the civil action to which she had\u00a0 been\u00a0 a party and in the motion in the Court of Land Registration\u00a0 for the\u00a0 recording in the name\u00a0 of the grantees of a half interest in the Malate land.\u00a0 All of these acts were in pursuance of Exhibit A.<br\/><br\/>On December 3, 1907, the plaintiff filed her complaint in the present action,\u00a0 and, after the\u00a0 joining of issue and the hearing\u00a0 of evidence, judgment was rendered in favor of defendants on the 29th day of May, 1909.\u00a0 From this judgment, after the usual motion for a new trial, its denial and exception to such denial, plaintiff appealed to this court. The\u00a0 Civil Code in relation to the subject-matter in hand contains the following provisions:<br\/><blockquote>\"Art.\u00a0 1265. Consent given under error, violence, intimidation, or deceit shall be null.<br\/><br\/>\"Art. 1267. There is violence when,\u00a0 in order to obtain the consent, irresistible force is used.<br\/><br\/>\"There\u00a0 is\u00a0 intimidation\u00a0 when\u00a0 one of\u00a0 the contracting parties gives his consent on\u00a0 account of a\u00a0 reasonable and well-grounded fear of\u00a0 suffering an imminent and serious injury to his\u00a0 person or property, or to the person or property of his spouse, descendants, or ascendants.<br\/><br\/>\"In determining whether or not there\u00a0 is intimidation, the age, sex, and status of the person intimidated must\u00a0 be considered.<br\/><br\/>\"Fear of displeasing the persons to whom obedience and respect are due shall not annul the\u00a0 contract.<br\/><br\/>\"Art. 1268.

Such a contract differs entirely in its incidents from a contract entered into by a party for the purpose of gain.\u00a0 The latter contract is made with pleasure and its terms complied with gladly. The former is a contract the execution of which the party is very apt to\u00a0 repent and the\u00a0 terms of which he\u00a0 is very likely to evade if he can.\u00a0\u00a0 It is\u00a0 not conclusive against them that Aldecoa &amp; Co. demanded\u00a0 that\u00a0 the plaintiff do something upon pain of punishing her husband for his crimes, It is not conclusive that the plaintiff\u00a0 disliked exceedingly to do what they demanded.\u00a0\u00a0 Neither is it conclusive\u00a0 that the plaintiff now regrets having performed at\u00a0 their\u00a0 demand instead of compelling a resort\u00a0 to judicial proceedings.\u00a0 It is not for these reasons that this contract may be\u00a0 declared null and void.\u00a0\u00a0 If such a\u00a0 contract were illegal, then, for the same reason, every contract would\u00a0 be illegal whereby pending litigation is\u00a0 settled by agreement\u00a0 of\u00a0 the parties rather than by decision of the\u00a0 court.\u00a0 If such a\u00a0 contract were null and\u00a0 void,\u00a0 then\u00a0 would be null and\u00a0 void every contract whereby\u00a0 a wrongdoer and he who assisted him made reparation for that which he had misappropriated or misapplied.\u00a0 In legal\u00a0 effect there is\u00a0 no difference\u00a0 between a contract wherein one of the contracting parties exchanges one\u00a0 condition for another because\u00a0 he looks for\u00a0 greater gain or profit by reason of such change and\u00a0 an agreement wherein one of the contracting parties agrees to accept the lesser of two disadvantages. In either case he makes a choice free and untrammeled\u00a0 and must accordingly abide by\u00a0 it.\u00a0 These are evidences of duress, facts from which duress may be\u00a0 inferred, but they are not duress of themselves.\u00a0 In the absence of other proof and\u00a0 circumstances, they\u00a0 might very\u00a0 well be\u00a0 held to\u00a0 establish duress. But there is other proof and we do not believe that\u00a0 under all the facts\u00a0 of\u00a0 this case as disclosed by the record we can say that the court below erred when he\u00a0 refused to\u00a0 find that the plaintiff entered into the contract in question by reason of\u00a0 duress\u00a0 and undue influence.\u00a0 We find lacking in this case many of the essential elements usually found in cases\u00a0 of duress.\u00a0 The most that the facts\u00a0 disclose is that the plaintiff\u00a0 was loath to relinquish certain rights\u00a0 which she claimed to have in certain property to the end that she might be relieved from litigation then pending against her and that her\u00a0 husband might escape prosecution for crimes alleged to\u00a0 have been committed; and that she persisted for a considerable time in her refusal to relinquish such claimed rights.\u00a0 The\u00a0 fact that she did relinquish them upon such consideration and under such condition does not\u00a0 of itself constitute duress or intimidation,\u00a0 nor does it destroy the obligatory effect and force of her consent.\u00a0 In order to do so something more is needed.\u00a0 Such influence must have been exercised over her that she was deprived\u00a0 of\u00a0 her free will and choice.\u00a0 She must\u00a0 have\u00a0 acted from fear and not from judgment.<br\/><br\/>Not every contract made by a wife to relieve her husband from\u00a0 the consequences of his crimes is voidable.\u00a0 Subject to certain restrictions a wife may legally dispose of her property as she pleases; she may squander it; she may give it away; she may pledge or transfer it to keep her husband out of state prison.\u00a0\u00a0 The question in each case is exactly the same as in all such relations, was she acting according to the dictates\u00a0 of\u00a0 her\u00a0 own judgment, whether\u00a0 good or bad, or from fear,\u00a0 force, or undue influence?\u00a0 If there are time and opportunity for judgment to take the place of fear, and if apart from the threat there are reasons disclosed which might lead\u00a0 one in the exercise of good judgment\u00a0 to perform\u00a0 the acts complained of, then the\u00a0 evidence as to duress and undue influence must be very\u00a0 clear in order that such acts may be recalled.<br\/><br\/>The appellant cites many cases\u00a0 in support of\u00a0 her contention that the\u00a0 contract of the 14th of August should be abrogated.<br\/><br\/>We have\u00a0 carefully examined not only all\u00a0 of the\u00a0 cases cited by the appellant but also substantially all of the cases within our reach relating to the question before us.\u00a0\u00a0 Among them\u00a0 are the following; Adams <i>vs<\/i> Irving\u00a0 National\u00a0 Bank (116 N.

Dyer (147 Mo., 219) t it appeared\u00a0 that the plaintiffs were the tenants of the defendant on\u00a0 defendant's farm.\u00a0 During the last year that they\u00a0 had occupied this farm they\u00a0 raised\u00a0 some\u00a0 500 bushels of corn upon which the defendant claimed to have a lien under the\u00a0 statute.\u00a0\u00a0 The plaintiff Hensinger sold the corn and applied the proceeds to his own use.\u00a0\u00a0 Dyer threatened to institute\u00a0 criminal proceedings against Hensinger for embezzling the corn if he and his wife did not execute to him their\u00a0 note\u00a0 for its value, secured by a deed\u00a0 of trust upon the land of Mrs. Hensinger.\u00a0 They testified that because of this threat and in fear of said prosecution they executed the note and deed of trust as required.\u00a0 Shortly before the\u00a0 papers were\u00a0 executed\u00a0 the defendant went\u00a0 to plaintiffs' residence,\u00a0 some 7\u00a0 miles from defendant's home, taking with him a notary public to take the acknowledgement of the deed of trust in the event that he succeeded in getting the plaintiffs to execute it.\u00a0\u00a0 This was\u00a0 one of the occasions upon which the defendant threatened to prosecute Hensinger if\u00a0 he and his wife did not execute the deed of trust as required.\u00a0\u00a0 Mrs, Hensinger had all the time refused and still refused to execute the deed; but upon the afternoon of that day plaintiffs went to Sedalia to consult with their son and with their attorney and thereafter went to J. M. Bailer's office and there executed the papers in question.\u00a0 The court held that the note and deed of trust were voidable as having been executed under duress.<br\/><br\/>It is at once apparent, however,\u00a0 that the facts differ materially from those in the case at bar.\u00a0 In that case the plaintiffs contended against the\u00a0 personal presence of\u00a0 the defendant and\u00a0 all\u00a0 of the influence\u00a0 which that\u00a0 presence implies.\u00a0\u00a0 In that case there was absolutely no consideration moving to\u00a0 Mrs. Hensinger inducing the execution of the papers in question\u00a0 except the release of\u00a0 her\u00a0 husband from prosecution.\u00a0\u00a0 There was\u00a0 lacking in that case everything, every consideration which would appeal to the judgment or reason of the complaining party.<br\/><br\/>The same may be said of the other two cases,\u00a0 Harris <i>vs.<\/i> Carmody and Williams<i> vs<\/i>. Bayley.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff cites also the case of Jalbuena <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs.<\/span> Ledesma et al.\u00a0 (8\u00a0 Phil. Rep., 601). In that case it appeared, as stated by the court, that - <br\/><blockquote>\"Ildefonso Doronila, having been the tutor of the Ledesma minor children, was cited in August,\u00a0 1900, before\u00a0 the provost court of Iloilo\u00a0 on the petition of the\u00a0 defendant Lopez, to show\u00a0 cause why he should not surrender the papers, securities, and money in his\u00a0 charge, and he was in the course of the proceeding ordered to render his accounts as tutor, and it is\u00a0 to\u00a0 be inferred\u00a0 from\u00a0 the\u00a0 testimony of the defendant Ledesma\u00a0 that the accounts were in fact rendered. On December 3 he came to an agreement with the defendant Lopez, as representative of the\u00a0 children,\u00a0 whereby his\u00a0 accounts were allowed and accepted and the\u00a0 value of the missing papers, claimed to have been lost in the bombardment of Iloilo, was fixed at P12,000, and a certain obligation of the\u00a0 estate to Juan Casells to the amount of P4,000 was assumed by him.\u00a0 Subsequently this agreement was ratified by the family council, which imposed, however, an additional condition that security\u00a0 should be given by Doronila for the payment of P16,000 in case the missing papers should not be produced within six\u00a0 months and the novation of the debt of Juan Casells accepted by the debtor.\u00a0\u00a0 Thereafter he was brought before the provost judge in the pending proceeding and\u00a0 was ordered to give additional security, and failing to do so was committed to jail, where he had already been once confined on the institution of the proceeding.\u00a0\u00a0 As all of his\u00a0 property was already\u00a0 bound\u00a0 to the estate for the performance of his\u00a0 duty\u00a0 as guardian, it became expedient to find a surety for him, and\u00a0 the plaintiff (wife of Doronila), who had accompanied him to the court,\u00a0 was thereupon induced to join with him\u00a0 in\u00a0 this undertaking.\u00a0 As to the\u00a0 preceedings in court, the testimony of the plaintiff, reduced to narrative form, is as follows:<br\/><br\/>\"'I remember having\u00a0 been\u00a0 in the office of the provost judge of Iloilo in December,\u00a0 1900.\u00a0\u00a0 I went\u00a0 there to visit my husband, who was in jail.\u00a0 While there I was summoned before\u00a0 the provost judge by a soldier, and I went up before the provost and requested him to set my husband free, he not being guilty of anything.\u00a0\u00a0 I\u00a0 asked\u00a0 him, crying, to put my husband\u00a0 at liberty, but the\u00a0 provost\u00a0 did\u00a0 not listen to me;\u00a0 on the contrary, he asked me to file security for what was\u00a0 lost in my\u00a0 house during the\u00a0 bombardment, and he told\u00a0 me that he was going to\u00a0 put my husband in jail if I did not obligate my property as security.\u00a0\u00a0 Fearing that he was\u00a0 going to be put in\u00a0 jail again, I was compelled to sign, it being a .time when we and others were under fear and I was\u00a0 afraid that he would be punished and that they would deport\u00a0 him.\u00a0 In the fear that I was then under I did not know any\u00a0 other remedy but to sign. He told me that my husband would be sent again to jail if I did not sign.\"<br\/><br\/>\"This communication was carried on through the medium of an interpreter, one Pedro Regalado, who testified:<br\/><br\/>\"'The provost judge told Sra. Vicenta\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 in these terms: \"You sign a document guaranteeing with your property the obligation contracted by Sr. Doronila, your husband.\"\u00a0 She answered to\u00a0 these\u00a0 words that\u00a0 her husband was not guilty of\u00a0 the loss\u00a0 of the documents, as when the bombardment came the documents were in a trunk and were lost\u00a0 during the bombardment.\u00a0 When\u00a0 she said\u00a0 that\u00a0 she could not respond, then the provost said: \"You\u00a0 sign this document; you either sign this document or I will send your husband back to jail.\"\u00a0 More or less I remember that he said: \"Interpreter, tell her to either sign this document or I will have her husband sent again to jail.\" ' \"<\/blockquote>In\u00a0 this case the wife sued to set aside the obligation upon the ground that it was obtained\u00a0 from her by duress and undue influence.\u00a0 She justly succeeded.<br\/><br\/>A mere reading of the facts in that case discloses that it can not be used\u00a0 as an authority in the case at bar.\u00a0\u00a0 It is widely different in its facts.<br\/><br\/>A careful analysis of this case discloses the following peculiarities:<br\/><br\/>In the first place, the undisputed evidence demonstrates that the first offers of compromise were made by the plaintiff herself\u00a0 through her representatives.\u00a0 It appears that from first to last the effort and anxiety to compromise the claims of the defendants were on the part of the plaintiff through her representatives.\u00a0 The position of Aldecoa &amp; Co. throughout the negotiations,\u00a0 as it appears from\u00a0 the testimony in the case, was that a settlement of their claims against the\u00a0 plaintiffs would not result in any peculiar or especial benefit to them inasmuch as by the actions already commenced\u00a0 against the plaintiff\u00a0 and her\u00a0 husband the defendants would be\u00a0 able, so they contended,\u00a0 to secure exactly the same property\u00a0 that they would obtain by the settlement proposed.\u00a0 The soundness of this contention was admitted by the attorneys for the plaintiff. It was the desire on the part of at least one of the persons especially interested in Aldecoa &amp; Co. that Alejandro S. Macleod should suffer criminally for the acts which he had committed against that company\u00a0 and such person did not hesitate to\u00a0 say so repeatedly.\u00a0 There seems to have been throughout the negotiations a fear on the part of the attorneys for the plaintiff that, partly, at least,\u00a0 by reason of this especial desire of said person, the negotiations would\u00a0 be\u00a0 broken off by\u00a0 Aldecoa &amp; Co. before a settlement could be\u00a0 consummated. The defendants never urged the plaintiff to desist from\u00a0 her pretensions or to\u00a0 accept\u00a0 the\u00a0 ultimatum laid down by\u00a0 the defendants.\u00a0 They simply stated to the attorneys for\u00a0 the plaintiff that they\u00a0 must have all of the Macleod property in satisfaction of\u00a0 their claims, and it\u00a0 appeared from\u00a0 the position\u00a0 assumed that it was immaterial to them whether they obtained\u00a0 those properties through the courts or by means of a settlement.\u00a0\u00a0 They left Macleod and his wife to choose for themselves, upon their own judgment and upon the\u00a0 advice of their attorneys and relatives,\u00a0 the course to be by them pursued.\u00a0\u00a0 That the defendants were not especially urging the\u00a0 settlement\u00a0 in question is\u00a0 demonstrated by the fact that Mr. Fisher, the attorney for the plaintiffs, was doubtful about securing\u00a0 the participation of Aldecoa &amp; Co. in the agreement up to the very moment of its execution, and it appears from the evidence of Mr.\u00a0 Cohn that Mr.\u00a0 Fisher,\u00a0 laboring\u00a0 under\u00a0 such\u00a0 apprehension, actually withheld important information from Aldecoa\u00a0 &amp; Co.\u00a0 for fear such information would deter them at the last moment from giving their assent to the arrangement.<br\/><br\/>In\u00a0 the second place, there were at no time during\u00a0 the course of these negotiations for settlement any direct personal relations\u00a0 or\u00a0 communications between\u00a0 the parties to this\u00a0 action.\u00a0 During the whole course of the negotiations no person\u00a0 communicated\u00a0 with the plaintiffs on behalf of the defendants\u00a0 alone.\u00a0 The offers, propositions, or threats, if any, made by the defendants were filtered to her through the personality, mind, and judgment of her own attorney or relatives, all of them being persons who had her welfare and the welfare of her\u00a0 family deeply at heart and who were acting for her and her\u00a0 husband and not for the defendants. That personal\u00a0 presence of the threatening party and the influence\u00a0 springing therefrom, factors so potent in duress and undue influence, were wholly lacking.<br\/><br\/>On the trial\u00a0 an attempt was made to show that the defendants had attempted to influence the\u00a0 plaintiff, Mercedes Martinez, by acting upon her through her son-in-law, Mr. Kingcome.\u00a0 As stated above, Mr. Stephen was asked by the attorneys for the plaintiff, as well as the attorneys for the defendants,\u00a0 to\u00a0 see Mr. Kingcome\u00a0 and ask him to explain to his mother-in-law the facts and circumstances which were the cause of the attempts at settlement for the\u00a0 purpose of inducing her to act reasonably in the\u00a0 premises.\u00a0 There was some dispute as to\u00a0 whether or not Mr. Kingcome actually communicated the substance of that interview to his mother-in-law prior to her signing the contract in question.\u00a0 Mr. Kingcome in his testimony states that\u00a0 according\u00a0 to his best recollection\u00a0 he communicated the\u00a0 substance\u00a0 of that interview to his mother-in-law on the 11th day\u00a0 of August. In considering this matter it must be remembered that the interview between Mr.\u00a0 Stephen and Mr. Kingcome was not brought about by Aldecoa &amp; Co. or its representatives.\u00a0 It was brought about by Mr. Conn acting as mediary between Mr. Fisher and Mr. Rosado, the one the attorney for the plaintiffs and the other the attorney for the defendant company, upon\u00a0 the request and with the express approval of both of them.\u00a0\u00a0 The interview which\u00a0 followed between Mr. Stephen and Mr. Kingcome was\u00a0 the\u00a0 direct act of plaintiff in exactly the same manner and in exactly the same degree as it was the act of Aldecoa &amp; Co.<br\/><br\/>In the third place, the plaintiff by\u00a0 means of the negotiations and settlement in\u00a0 question was engaged partly at least in the settlement of her own suits and controversies.\u00a0 The plaintiff, Mercedes Martinez, together with Aldecoa &amp; Co. and Viuda e Hijos de F. Escano\u00a0 were sued in April, 1907, by the Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation in relation\u00a0 to P45,000 worth of notes claimed to have been fraudulently\u00a0 taken from the assets of Aldecoa &amp; Co. and transferred into the name and possession of the plaintiff,\u00a0 Mercedes Martinez.\u00a0\u00a0 This was one\u00a0 of the actions settled and terminated by the contract in question.\u00a0\u00a0 In this property the plaintiff released her rights under the settlement.\u00a0\u00a0 The only other property\u00a0 to which she\u00a0 released her rights was a half interest in property in Malate.\u00a0 As to the legality of her claim that this property was her own individual property there was a serious question, so\u00a0 serious in\u00a0 fact that she was formally and repeatedly advised by her\u00a0 attorneys that such claim was in their judgment unfounded. These are the only interests which the plaintiff, Mercedes\u00a0 Martinez, released or\u00a0 gave\u00a0 over in\u00a0 the settlement complained of.\u00a0\u00a0 Both of the claims were substantially in litigation and the legality of both was seriously questioned and strongly doubted by\u00a0 her own attorneys.\u00a0 While it is\u00a0 not\u00a0 necessary to decide and we do not decide whether her claim to either of those properties was valid or invalid, still the fact that the validity of her claims thereto\u00a0 was denied by her own attorneys strongly tends to\u00a0 impeach\u00a0 the claim\u00a0 that she released those properties by reason of duress and undue influence,\u00a0 rather\u00a0 than as a result\u00a0 of\u00a0 her own\u00a0 deliberate judgment.<br\/><br\/>In the fourth place, it must be\u00a0 remembered that\u00a0 the plaintiff,\u00a0 Mercedes Martinez,\u00a0 never at any\u00a0 time stood alone in the negotiations.\u00a0\u00a0 There was never a moment\u00a0 when she did not\u00a0 have interposed between\u00a0 her and the defendants the counsel\u00a0 of skilled attorneys and\u00a0 of interested\u00a0 relatives. Whatever came to her from the\u00a0 defendants, their demands or their threats, if any, reached her through the medium of her friends and advisers.\u00a0 She had the assistance of legal learning and business intelligence and experience.\u00a0\u00a0 She had the careful and thoughtful advice of her family.\u00a0\u00a0 She was as far as possible relieved from all fear, stress, or influence except such as were inherent in the circumstances themselves.\u00a0 It appears undisputed that she and her\u00a0 relatives and lawyers considered throughout the negotiations\u00a0 and down to and including the time of the execution of the agreement of settlement that her best interests would be\u00a0 subserved by acceding to the terms laid down by the defendants.\u00a0 From the evidence in the case it is difficult to arrive at a\u00a0 conclusion other than that the acts\u00a0 which\u00a0 she\u00a0 performed in making the\u00a0 settlement in question were\u00a0 acts which contributed to her welfare and the welfare of her whole family.\u00a0 While this fact may not be conclusive in the present case, it nevertheless is of very great importance and significance in determining the question whether duress and undue influence were exercised or whether she acted from uncoerced judgment after weighing\u00a0 the reasons pro and con.<br\/><br\/>In the fifth place, we must not overlook the fact that the plaintiff took advantage of said contract\u00a0 after its execution and required the complete fulfilling of every one of its provisions favorable to herself.\u00a0 She negotiated with Aldecoa &amp; Co. for a partition of the Malate\u00a0 property and to that end caused a survey and a division thereof to be made. She demanded\u00a0 of Aldecoa &amp; Co. payment of the P2,000 provided for by the contract, which said sum she received. She caused one-half of said Malate property to be assessed against said company.\u00a0\u00a0 She caused a change to be made in the proceedings to register the title to said Malate\u00a0 lands, previously begun by her, so as to register her title to only one-half thereof.\u00a0\u00a0 She\u00a0 caused\u00a0 to be dismissed\u00a0 the action pending against her on account of the Escano notes,\u00a0 which dismissal occurred after this present action was commenced. These acts are mentioned\u00a0 not to\u00a0 show a ratification of the contract in\u00a0 the sense that those acts estopped her from thereafter questioning the same, but rather as confirmatory of the theory that in\u00a0 the execution of the contract complained of she acted according to the dictates of good business judgment rather than from duress and undue influence.<br\/><br\/>As we have\u00a0 already stated, not every contract executed by a wife,\u00a0 even though made solely to save her husband from the consequences of his crimes, is voidable.\u00a0 Solicitation, importunity, argument, and persuasion are not undue influence and a contract is not to be set aside merely because one party used these means to obtain the consent of the other.\u00a0 Influence obtained by persuasion or argument or by appeals to the affections is not prohibited either in law or morals and is not obnoxious even in courts of equity.\u00a0 Such may be termed \"due influence,\"\u00a0\u00a0 The line between due and undue influence, when drawn, must be with full recognition of the liberty due\u00a0 every\u00a0 true owner to obey the voice of justice, the dictates of friendship, of gratitude and of benevolence, as well\u00a0 as\u00a0 the\u00a0 claims\u00a0 of kindred, and, when\u00a0 not hindered\u00a0 by personal incapacity\u00a0 or\u00a0 particular regulations, to dispose of his own property according to his own free choice.\u00a0 (9 Cyc, 455, and cases there cited,)<br\/><br\/>On\u00a0 the other hand\u00a0 contracts entered into\u00a0 by\u00a0 a wife whereby she conveys property unquestionably hers, the sole and only\u00a0 consideration for which contract is the obtaining for her husband immunity from criminal prosecution,\u00a0 are always justly the objects of suspicion, and it is\u00a0 a wise jurisprudence which holds that, where she defends upon the ground that she was duressed, the party enforcing such contract must expect the very closest scrutiny of the transaction with the presumptions\u00a0 all against\u00a0 him.\u00a0\u00a0 Where, however,\u00a0 as in this case, there is a real question as to\u00a0 the validity of claims laid by the wife to the property transferred, some of which claimed rights are involved in actual litigation\u00a0 in which she is a party, while the remainder are alleged by opposing claimants to\u00a0 be subject to seizure and sale under judgments against the husband; and competent and honorable counsel,\u00a0 after careful and extended\u00a0 consideration of the facts and the law, advise her that the rights so claimed by her in the property transferred are fictitious, unreal, and defeasible,\u00a0 having no foundation in law, and she, after abundant opportunity\u00a0 for\u00a0 deliberate\u00a0 consideration,\u00a0 releases such\u00a0 claimed rights and thereby not only secures immunity for her husband, but also quiets litigation against herself, a very different question is presented.\u00a0 It is\u00a0 undisputed that the attorneys\u00a0 for the plaintiff in this case advised her that, from the facts which they had before them, facts of which she was fully informed, her husband had been guilty of embezzlement and misappropriation in the management of the business of Aldecoa &amp; Co. and that, in\u00a0 their judgment, if prosecuted therefor, he would be convicted.\u00a0 They further advised her that the P45,000 worth of\u00a0 notes claimed by her and to recover which was part of the purpose\u00a0 of the action against\u00a0 her and\u00a0 her husband\u00a0 by the Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation were a part of\u00a0 the property of which\u00a0 her husband\u00a0 had criminally deprived the said company.\u00a0\u00a0 They advised her that she would not be able to hold such notes as\u00a0 her own.\u00a0 They further advised her that from\u00a0 the facts before them Aldecoa &amp; Co. would have no difficulty in getting a judgment for a\u00a0 very large amount against her husband, and, in that event, the interest which she claimed in the Malate property would be liable to seizure and sale under said judgment, said property being in their judgment <i>ganancial <\/i> They\u00a0 informed her that all\u00a0 that Aldecoa\u00a0 &amp; Co. required\u00a0 of\u00a0 her was the transfer of\u00a0 her claimed\u00a0 rights in\u00a0 said property.\u00a0 They further advised her that if\u00a0 she did not so transfer such property, Aldecoa &amp; Co.\u00a0 would nevertheless obtain it\u00a0 by means of the actions already commenced and to\u00a0 be commenced ; that if she did transfer it she would lose no more than she would lose by means of said actions and she would gain in addition the immunity of her husband from criminal prosecution.\u00a0 In other\u00a0 words, under the advice of her counsel, the\u00a0 situation\u00a0 was so presented to her that it\u00a0 was evident that in signing the agreement of the 14th of August she had all to gain\u00a0 and\u00a0 nothing to lose, whereas, in refusing to sign said agreement, she had all to lose and nothing\u00a0 to gain.\u00a0\u00a0 In the one case she would lose\u00a0 her property and save her husband.\u00a0\u00a0 In the other, she would lose her property and her husband\u00a0 too.\u00a0 The argument thus presented to her by her attorneys addressed itself to judgment and not to fear.\u00a0\u00a0 It appealed to reason and not to passion.\u00a0\u00a0 It asked her to be moved\u00a0 by common sense and not by love of\u00a0 family.\u00a0 It spoke to her own interests as much\u00a0 as to those of her husband.\u00a0 The argument went to her financial interests as well as to those of the defendants.\u00a0 It\u00a0 spoke to her business judgment as well as to her wifely affections. From the opinions of her attorneys, as they were presented to her upon facts assumed by all to be true, we do not well see how she\u00a0 coultf reasonably\u00a0 have reached a conclusion other than that which\u00a0 she did reach.\u00a0\u00a0 It\u00a0 is of no\u00a0 consequence here whether\u00a0 or not her lawyers advised her wrongly.\u00a0 It is of no importance whether, as matter of law, she would have been deprived of her alleged interests in the properties mentioned in\u00a0 the manner described and advised by her attorneys.\u00a0 The important thing is that she believed and accepted their judgment and acted upon it.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 question is\u00a0 not did\u00a0 she make\u00a0 a mistake, but did she consent; not was she\u00a0 wrongly advised,\u00a0 but\u00a0 was\u00a0 she coerced; not was she wise, but was she duressed.<br\/><br\/>From the whole case we are of the opinion that the finding of the court below that the plaintiff\u00a0 executed the contract\u00a0 in suit of\u00a0 her own free will and choice and\u00a0 not\u00a0 from duress is fully sustained by the\u00a0 evidence.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the\u00a0 court below is, therefore, affirmed with costs\u00a0 against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.J., Torres, Mapa, <\/i> and <i>Johnson, JJ.,<\/i> concur.<br\/><\/div>",

THE DIRECTOR OF PRISONS, RESPONDENT<br\/>\n<br\/>\nD E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TRENT, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">On October 14, 1910, there was presented in this court a petition on behalf of Juan M. Cruz, praying that a writ of habeas corpus issue directed to the warden of Bilibid Prison, requiring him to bring the body of the petitioner into court. The petition states that Juan M. Cruz is imprisoned and restrained of his personal liberty in Bilibid Prison in the city of Manila by the warden of said prison without authority of law. It is further alleged in the petition that the petitioner was tried, convicted, and sentenced by one of the Courts of First Instance of the city of Manila in criminal cases Nos. 1489 and 966, he being sentenced in the first case to imprisonment for a term of three years, to pay a fine of P1,000, and to the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency in the payment of the fine, and in the second case to a term of two years' imprisonment and to pay a fine of $2,000 United States currency; that this last case was appealed to the Supreme Court and affirmed, without subsidiary imprisonment in case the fine was not paid; that the petitioner having extinguished these sentences is now entitled to his liberty.<br\/><br\/>An order was issued requiring the warden of Bilibid Prison to show cause, if any existed, why the writ should not issue. On the return day thereof the said warden made return thereto in substance as follows:<br\/><br\/>That the petitioner is now undergoing in Bilibid Prison the sentences imposed upon him by the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, one of three years' imprisonment and a fine of P1,000, with the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, for the crime of conspiracy against the Government, and the other of two years' imprisonment and a fine of P4,000, for the crime of sedition; that the imprisonment imposed in the two cases, without counting the subsidiary imprisonment, is five years; that the petitioner having commenced to serve these sentences on the 15th of November, 1905, the same will expire on the 15th of November, 1910; that for good conduct, under the provisions of Act No. 1533 (the petitioner was not allowed the full time for good conduct under this Act on account of certain violations of prison regulations), the five years' imprisonment expired on the 4th of June, 1910; that the petitioner is now serving the subsidiary imprisonment on account of his failure to pay the P1,000 fine in case No. 1489, which subsidiary imprisonment will expire about the 9th of July, 1911, at the rate of P2.50 a day.<br\/><br\/>The writ as prayed for having been issued on the 21st of October, 1910, and the hearing having been set for the 22d of the same month, the case was submitted upon the answer of the respondent to show cause.<br\/><br\/>The respondent admits that the terms of imprisonment imposed upon the petitioner, after giving him the time to which he is entitled for good conduct, expired on the 4th of June, 1910. The only question to determine is the legality of that part of the sentence of the Court of First Instance condemning the petitioner to subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency in the payment of the P1,000 fine. In this case the petitioner was tried and convicted for having violated the provisions of Act No. 292 of the Philippine Commission, which went into effect on the 4th day of November, 1901. Act No.1732, which went into effect on November 1, 1907, provides that when a fine is imposed as a whole, or as any part of the punishment for any criminal offense made punishable by any Act or Acts of the Philippine Commission, the court shall also sentence the guilty person to subsidiary imprisonment until the fine is satisfied; provided, that such subsidiary imprisonment shall not, in any case, exceed one year; but in case the court imposes both a fine and imprisonment the subsidiary imprisonment shall not exceed one-third of the term of imprisonment imposed by such sentence. The penalty of three years' imprisonment and a fine of P1,000 having been imposed upon the petitioner long before this Act (No. 1732) went into effect, its provisions are not applicable to the question under consideration, as such Act, being a penal statute, can not have a retroactive effect for the reason that such effect would not be beneficial to the petitioner. (Art. 22, Penal Code; U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Macasaet, 11 Phil. Rep., 447.) Prior to the passage of Act No. 1732, Courts of First Instance had no authority to impose subsidiary imprisonment for failure to pay fines in cases of conviction for violations of the Acts of the Philippine Commission, and such errors when committed have been corrected by this court in those cases which were appealed. (U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Hutchinson, 5 Phil. Rep., 343; U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Lineses, 5 Phil. Rep., 631; U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Macasaet, <i>supra<\/i>.)<br\/><br\/>In the case at bar the Court of First Instance had jurisdiction of the offense described in the complaint for which the petitioner was tried. It had jurisdiction of the prisoner who was properly brought before it. It had jurisdiction to hear and decide upon the defenses offered by him, but it did not have power to sentence the petitioner to subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency in the payment of the fine imposed. It is therefore clear that that part of the judgment is void. This court at this time has no power to correct this error committed by the court below, neither has it power to remand the case to the trial court for that purpose. The fact that the petitioner did not appeal can not affect the question as the two penalties imposed are separate and distinct. The courts uniformly hold that where a sentence imposes a punishment in excess of the power of the court to impose, such sentence is void as to the excess, and some of the courts hold that the sentence is void <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">in toto;<\/span> but the weight of authority sustains the proposition that such a sentence is void only as to the excess imposed in case the parts are separable, the rule being that the petitioner is not entitled to his discharge on a writ of <i>habeas corpus<\/i> unless he has served out so much of the sentence as was valid. {<i>Ex parte<\/i> Erdmann, 88 Cal., 579; Lowrey <i>vs<\/i>.

S., 461.)<br\/><br\/>The petitioner has served out, according to the return of the respondent to the order to show cause, the entire part of the sentences which the court below had power to impose, and adhering to the rule that that part of the sentence imposed by the court below in excess of its jurisdiction is void, the petitioner is entitled to his release.<br\/><br\/>It is, therefore, ordered that the petitioner be discharged from custody and that the costs of these proceedings be. adjudged <i>de oficio.<\/i><br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

The defendants offered, if the owner would give them time, to collect\u00a0 these notes and pay him the proceeds.\u00a0\u00a0 It appears undisputed that the sales of the jewelry were made in good faith\u00a0 by\u00a0 the defendants\u00a0 and that\u00a0 the promissory notes taken\u00a0 from the purchasers of said jewelry by\u00a0 the defendants were <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">bona fide<\/span> in every\u00a0 respect.\u00a0\u00a0 It does not appear whether the notes were good, bad,\u00a0 or indifferent, collectible or uncollectible.\u00a0 Neither does it\u00a0 appear what they were actually worth.\u00a0 The only\u00a0 evidence produced by the prosecution and, therefore,\u00a0 the only evidence upon which\u00a0 the defendants were convicted, was, as before stated, that they had\u00a0 taken the property in question\u00a0 upon the terms\u00a0 and conditions mentioned in the receipt above quoted and that they\u00a0 had\u00a0 failed\u00a0 to return either jewelry\u00a0 or the\u00a0 value thereof, but, instead, had sold said jewelry on credit and taken\u00a0 promissory notes from\u00a0 the\u00a0 purchasers for the purchase price.<br\/><br\/>While the question in this\u00a0 precise form has\u00a0 never heretofore been\u00a0 presented to this court, we are of\u00a0 the opinion that the principles laid down, either expressly or impliedly, in many similar cases, are applicable to this.\u00a0 This court has uniformly required, either expressly or impliedly, that to convict there must be some evidence of <i>conversion of the property\u00a0 to the benefit of the accused\u00a0 or of\u00a0 some\u00a0 other person <\/i>- that there must be an intention to convert.<br\/><br\/>A number of cases decided by this court have been cited by the fiscal to sustain the conviction in this case.\u00a0 It may not be amiss to examine them.<br\/><br\/>In the case of .the United\u00a0 States\u00a0 vs. Pascual\u00a0 (10 Phil. Rep.,\u00a0 621),\u00a0 this court passed upon the question\u00a0 only of whether or\u00a0 not to constitute\u00a0 estafa within the terms of article 535, subdivision 5, it was necessary that the property be secured from the possession of the owner by deceit or fraud;\u00a0 and it was there held that \"deceit with intent to defraud, in obtaining the money or other personal property afterwards misappropriated, is not always an essential requisite.\"<br\/><br\/>In the case of the United States <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>.

It was clearly proved on the trial that the person to whom the\u00a0 accused claimed she had\u00a0 given the rosary for sale on commission had died of cholera in Vigan four years prior to the date of the alleged delivery.\u00a0 In that case the court said (p. 479):<br\/><blockquote>\"It should be observed, on the other hand, that the Penal Code punishes not only the appropriation but also <i>the conversion<\/i> of property received under the obligation to return it, as in the present case.\"<\/blockquote>The evidence here was very clear\u00a0 that the accused intended to convert the\u00a0 rosary\u00a0 <i>to her own <\/i>use and that she actually did do so.\u00a0 The court further said in\u00a0 that case (p. 478):<br\/><blockquote>\"That in the behavior of the accused the\u00a0 elements which constitute\u00a0 the crime of <i>estafa <\/i>are present,\u00a0 i. e., <i>the deceit by which it was intended to defraud,<\/i>\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In the case\u00a0 of the United States <i>vs.<\/i> Zamora\u00a0 (2 Phil.

As she did not do so, the son of the owner of\u00a0 the jewelry went next\u00a0 day in search of the defendant.\u00a0 He was unable to find her until after some days had passed.\u00a0 Then the defendant pleaded with the owner of the jewels that she\u00a0 be\u00a0 given an\u00a0 extension of time for their\u00a0 return.\u00a0 She failed, however, upon various\u00a0 pretexts to return the jewels.\u00a0 In explanation of what became of the jewels the defendant asserted that\u00a0 she had delivered them to a broker, who stated that she either lost\u00a0 them or that they were stolen from her.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 court held upon this evidence that the defendant was guilty of <i>estafa.<\/i>\u00a0\u00a0 The evidence of misappropriation or\u00a0 conversion to the use of defendant or of some other person was clear.<br\/><br\/>In the case of the United States <i>vs.<\/i> Ner (4 Phil.

all set with diamonds, of the total value of P869; that this jewelry had been given to the defendant to be\u00a0 sold by him on commission ; that instead of doing so the\u00a0 defendant, with the intention\u00a0 of profiting thereby, misapplied and\u00a0 embezzled the value of said jewelry to the prejudice of the owner thereof.\u00a0\u00a0 The court found the defendant guilty, predicating that decision upon the foregoing facts and upon the further fact that the defendant \"<i>did not give any account as to the whereabouts of the jewelry or the value thereof,\"<\/i><br\/><br\/>In\u00a0 the case of the United States <i>vs. <\/i> Jockers (7 Phil Rep., 464)\u00a0 it appeared, as stated by the court,\u00a0 that\u00a0 \"the accused\u00a0 was employed by Weingarten\u00a0 Brothers\u00a0 to

that he\u00a0 had a special opportunity to make\u00a0 a sale to two Turks who\u00a0 were\u00a0 to meet him that evening at the Waldorf Hotel.\u00a0 Upon this\u00a0 representation he was intrusted with goods valued at P267.18 Philippine\u00a0 currency, for which it was understood he would render an account the\u00a0 following day, the terms of his commission obligating him\u00a0 to return the goods intrusted or the money received therefor,\u00a0 less his commission.\"<br\/><br\/>The court said (p. 465):<br\/><blockquote>\"It does not appear whether this representation was or was not made in good faith, but the accused failed to return on the following morning\u00a0 as\u00a0 agreed, and he left the city of\u00a0 Manila, taking the goods intrusted to him to some of the outlying barrios and municipalities, where he remained until the 24th of February, when he was\u00a0 arrested at the instance of his employers.<br\/><br\/>\"During his absence he sold various\u00a0 articles from his stock amounting to P37.77 Philippine currency, for which he failed to make an accounting, the rest of the goods being found in his possession and being returned to his employers.<br\/><br\/>\"The information charges the accused\u00a0 with <i>estafa<\/i> of all the goods intrusted to him,\u00a0 but we are of\u00a0 opinion\u00a0 that, <i>as\u00a0 to the goods unsold <\/i> and\u00a0 which\u00a0 were returned to the owners,<i> the charge of estafa can not be\u00a0 maintained.<\/i>\u00a0 The evidence of record strongly tends to establish the fact that in taking the goods intrusted to him outside of the city of Manila he was merely seeking a better field for his peddling operations and that <i>it was\u00a0 not his intention to appropriate<\/i> these goods <i>to his own use <\/i>or to make\u00a0 away with the proceeds after selling them.\u00a0 The fact that he did not return at the time stipulated, and the fact that he went beyond the limits of the city of Manila without the permission of his employers, taken\u00a0 by themselves and without any other evidence as to his motive, might and probably would be sufficient\u00a0 to\u00a0 raise\u00a0 the\u00a0 presumption\u00a0 that it\u00a0 was the accused's intention to make away with all the goods intrusted to him, but his conduct during his absence appears to have been\u00a0 wholly\u00a0 inconsistent with such an\u00a0 intention, and we think in view of all the circumstances that it affirmatively appears that\u00a0 he at no time entertained such a plan.\"<\/blockquote>In this case the defendant was declared not guilty of the conversion of the goods unsold because of the <i>lack of intention to convert to his own use<\/i>, but he was held to be guilty of converting the proceeds resulting from the sale of the remaining\u00a0 merchandise, amounting to P37.77.<br\/><br\/>It is apparent that the cases\u00a0 above set forth do not sustain the contention of the prosecution that the defendants in the case at bar are guilty of the crime of <i>estafa<\/i>.\u00a0\u00a0 In all those cases\u00a0 there was present evidence of the\u00a0 conversion of the goods by the\u00a0 defendant <i>to his own use<\/i> or\u00a0 <i>to the use of some other person.<\/i><br\/><br\/>Paragraph 5 of article 535 of the Penal Code is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Art. 535.\u00a0 The following shall incur the penalties of the

received as a deposit\u00a0 on\u00a0 commission for administration\u00a0 or in any other character producing the obligation to deliver or return the same, or who shall deny having received it.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Commenting upon that subdivision, Groizard, volume 5, page 16, says:<br\/><blockquote>\"Other classes of<i> estafa:<\/i><br\/><br\/>\"A\u00a0 new type now presents itself for

confidence of the\u00a0 passive subject of the crime as a common factor and prevailing circumstance.\u00a0 With regard to the persons accused in the present case such fraudulent activity as is employed by the guilty\u00a0 in order to\u00a0 obtain possession of a thing, or to effect a fraud, does not\u00a0 exist, or exists in but few cases and in limited proportions.\u00a0 <i>Impudence, barefacedness, covetousness, and disloyalty employed in taking advantage of an opportunity\u00a0 <\/i>take here the place formerly occupied by\u00a0 deceit.\u00a0 It has been rightly\u00a0 stated by the Supreme Court 'that if the crime of estafa generally contains the element of deceit, the one specially (fennel in paragraph 5 of article 548 of the Penal\u00a0 Code\u00a0 (equivalent to No. 5 of article 535 of that for the Philippines)\u00a0 implies on the part of the person committing it a more or less <i>serious abuse of confidence, it being the purpose of the criminal to obtain and benefit, to the prejudice or fraud of third persons,<\/i> availing himself of any of the means specified in the code.'\u00a0 (Decision of November 26, 1884.)\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Viada, discussing this same subdivision, says in his Commentaries on the Penal Code (vol. 3, 4th ed., p. 514) :<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup><br\/><blockquote>\"In the matter of <i>estafa,<\/i> this is unquestionably the article which is most frequently\u00a0 applied in practice, it being also the one that presents the most difficulties.\u00a0 It is therefore advisable to\u00a0 take carefully into consideration the essential elements\u00a0 of the same.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 fact\u00a0 of\u00a0 having received a thing constitutes the first element, and in this the said crime differs from that of theft, the first,element of which is the taking of the thing.\u00a0 It is important to bear in mind such an\u00a0 essential circumstance so\u00a0 as not\u00a0 to\u00a0 mistake the one crime for the other.\u00a0 In Question 11 of the commentary on article 533, we have already seen that, by reason of having overlooked such an important distinction, the appeal\u00a0 in casacidn interposed\u00a0 by the public\u00a0 prosecutor\u00a0 in\u00a0 the case therein dealt with was rejected.\u00a0 The second requisite consists\u00a0 in that the thing received be money, goods, or any other personal\u00a0 property, in a word, anything which, owing to its value, may be an article of trade, among which we think are deeds and documents the appropriation or misappropriation of which might cause a material prejudice\u00a0\u00a0 as, for example, a deed of sale, a promissory note, a receipt for money,\u00a0 etc.\u00a0 The third element of this crime consists in that the above-stated things may have been received by virtue of deposit, on commission, or for administration, or under any other title producing the obligation to deliver or return them; that is, to deliver or return the same thing that was\u00a0 received\u00a0 (not an equivalent\u00a0 thereto in\u00a0 kind or quality), as\u00a0 happens\u00a0 with\u00a0 the deposit,\u00a0 commission, and administration\u00a0 specially dealt with in said article,\u00a0 and also, for example, in the contract of commodatum by which the bailee is required to\u00a0 return the same thing that he received for a stated use.\u00a0 Finally, the fourth\u00a0 and\u00a0 last\u00a0 requisite essential to the crime defined in this number consists in the <i>appropriation or misappropriation of the thing by whoever received it under such a title <\/i>and which obliges him to make restitution thereof, or denying the fact that he received it.\"<\/blockquote>The proposition that an accused may not be convicted of estafa without\u00a0 proof of the misappropriation or improper diversion of the property intrusted to his care <i>to his own use or to the use of another<\/i>, sanctioned as we have seen by the supreme court of Spain and by the great commentators on the Penal Code,\u00a0 and by the decisions of\u00a0 this\u00a0 court, is supported by the American authorities\u00a0 also.\u00a0\u00a0 (Pullan <i>vs.<\/i> State, 78 Ala.,\u00a0

Rep., 606)\u00a0 it was held that when\u00a0 an agent who\u00a0 has been intrusted\u00a0 with goods to be sold at a price fixed by the owner sells\u00a0 them\u00a0 at less\u00a0 than the price fixed\u00a0 and appropriates to his\u00a0 own use\u00a0 the\u00a0 money\u00a0 realized,\u00a0 the crime of <i>estafa<\/i> which he\u00a0 thereby commits consists in the misappropriation <i> and not in the wrongful sale. <\/i>\u00a0 In that case Ramona\u00a0 R. Evangelista delivered certain\u00a0 jewels to Juliana\u00a0 Torres under the obligation\u00a0 on the\u00a0 part of Juliana Torres to sell them at a fixed price for each jewel or <i>in case she\u00a0 could not sell\u00a0 them\u00a0 at that price to return them on\u00a0 a certain date.<\/i> She sold a\u00a0 ring for P300 for which\u00a0 the\u00a0 selling price was fixed by her agreement at P600.\u00a0\u00a0 She also sold a pair of earrings for P100 for which the price fixed in the agreement was P200.\u00a0 The question\u00a0 before the court was, Did the act of the commission agent in selling goods received for less than the\u00a0 price fixed by the contract of commission constitute the crime of <i>estafa?<\/i>\u00a0\u00a0 In discussing this\u00a0 question, the court said (p. 608) :<br\/><blockquote>\"If the\u00a0 act of selling the goods received\u00a0 on commission at a price lower\u00a0 than the one fixed\u00a0 constitutes the crime of<i> estafa<\/i>,\u00a0 then the owner of the thing sold has not lost its legal possession, and it should be restored to him either by the guilty person or by the third person who, in an illegal manner, obtained the possession of the thing illegally sold; and in that\u00a0 case the articles\u00a0 of the Penal Code above cited are applicable,\u00a0 and the thing misappropriated should be returned either by the guilty person or by the third person who unlawfully retains it in his possession\u00a0 as the\u00a0 object of an estafa committed by the one who sold it to him.<br\/><br\/>\"But, if the act in question\u00a0 does\u00a0 not constitute <i>estafa, since the act\u00a0 of transferring a\u00a0 thing\u00a0 sold to\u00a0 a third party in such a manner,<\/i> as it were between principal and agent, <i> is not punished by any statute,<\/i> although illegal on the part of the latter, yet after\u00a0 all <i>it was not illegal as between the seller and the purchaser,<\/i> and it\u00a0 is sufficient that it was not illegal (it not proceeding from a crime)\u00a0 in order that the acquisition be legal and the possession be just and lawful.

that the said Pablo Rallonza and Teodoro Evangelista\u00a0 are sufficient to represent the interests of the rest of the plaintiffs and defendants, respectively.\"\u00a0 And in accordance therewith the trial was continued in the name of the said\u00a0 Rallonza and Evangelista only, though they both represented, as it appears, all the other interested parties, who were very numerous, both plaintiffs and defendants, according to the statement contained in the\u00a0 complaint.\u00a0\u00a0 After all the evidence had been submitted,\u00a0 the Court of\u00a0 First Instance rendered judgment as follows;<br\/><blockquote>\"Pablo Rallonza, and many others not mentioned by name, claim the ownership of the land described in the complaint and situated at the place called Puritac, Paoay, Ilocos Norte, as against\u00a0 Teodoro Evangelista and many others,\u00a0 likewise not mentioned by name, the former alleging that the latter unlawfully\u00a0 occupy the same.<br\/><br\/>\"The defendant denies the charge.<br\/><br\/>\"It appears by the evidence that the original owner of the lands of Puritac and Badio or Salamanca, Paoay, Ilocos Norte, was\u00a0 Felix Duque; that the latter's heirs, whose names or number\u00a0 are not given, covenanted with the Pagdilao family of Badoc, without any stipulation as to\u00a0 who or how many composed the\u00a0 family, to divide the\u00a0 said lands and bring water thereon for irrigation, the\u00a0 same being irrigable; that the\u00a0 actual division that may\u00a0 have been made is\u00a0 not shown, nor among whom it was made; that it is likewise not shown what portions of the lands above mentioned were reserved\u00a0 undivided, and what parcels were not reserved; and\u00a0 that, finally, it is not shown who are the\u00a0 descendants of the descendants of Felix Duque, nor who are those of Pagdilao\u00a0 and their descendants who may have taken part in the work on the irrigation ditches and in the division of the lands.<br\/><br\/>\"Although it appears, by the record, that certain\u00a0 persons belonging either to\u00a0 the Duque family or to the Pagdilao family apparently executed acts\u00a0 of dominion\u00a0 over\u00a0 specific parcels of the said lands, it is certain that it is not possible to determine whether the said persons were or were\u00a0 not the owners, because the real division, which\u00a0 is alleged to have been made, is not known, so that\u00a0 the litigating parties themselves\u00a0 do not know\u00a0 and can\u00a0 not say who are\u00a0 the plaintiffs and who are the defendants, or better said, it is not known who are the owners and which\u00a0 are the properties that pertain to them, neither in general nor in particular.<br\/><br\/>\"Not being able, for\u00a0 the reasons set forth, to determine who is the owner or who are\u00a0 the owners of the lands\u00a0 in question, the court acquits the\u00a0 defendant\u00a0 of the complaint, without special finding of costs.\"<\/blockquote>In view of the premises established in the judgment, and which accord with\u00a0 the weight\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 evidence and the allegation made in the complaint that the\u00a0 parties interested in the lands in litigation, both\u00a0 as plaintiffs\u00a0 and as defendants,\u00a0 are very numerous,\u00a0 it is evident that the\u00a0 suit was improperly prosecuted and decided in the name of all the aforesaid interested parties\u00a0 to whom reference\u00a0 is made, under the supposition\u00a0 that\u00a0 the latter were\u00a0 represented therein by\u00a0 Pablo Rallonza and Teodoro Evangelista, respectively, the\u00a0 only ones who personally appeared in their own right and in representation of the former at the trial.<br\/><br\/>It appears\u00a0 that the\u00a0 parties\u00a0 proceeded as herein before related because of the provisions of section 118 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions.\u00a0\u00a0 The text\u00a0 of this section is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"SEC. 118. <i> Numerous parties.<\/i> - When the subject-matter of the controversy is one of common or general interest\u00a0 to many persons, and the\u00a0 parties are so numerous that\u00a0 it is impracticable to bring\u00a0 them all before the court, one or more may sue or defend for the benefit of all.\u00a0\u00a0 But in\u00a0 such case any party in interest shall have a right to intervene in protection of his individual interest, and\u00a0 the court shall make sure that the parties actually before it are sufficiently numerous and representative so that all interests concerned are fully protected.\"<\/blockquote>Whatever be the real\u00a0 meaning of those\u00a0 provisions, under the different\u00a0 aspects in\u00a0 which they may be\u00a0 considered, we hold it to\u00a0 be\u00a0 certain and unquestionable that they ought not to and can\u00a0 not\u00a0 apply to actions instituted, as in the present case, for the recovery\u00a0 of property.\u00a0\u00a0 This class of actions should always be promoted by the interested parties themselves and\u00a0 in the name of all and each one of them, in order that, as stated in section 114 of the aforementioned code of procedure, there may be a determination or complete settlement of the questions in litigation.\u00a0\u00a0 He who considers himself entitled to a certain property can not be ignorant as to who are his coowners, if\u00a0 he\u00a0 has any; and, knowing them, he can not neglect to make them\u00a0 parties to\u00a0 the suit under the pretext that they are numerous.\u00a0 This\u00a0 sole\u00a0 circumstance does not make their summons and appearance impossible when they are\u00a0 personally known.\u00a0 In such a case,\u00a0 the reason or motive inspiring the provisions of section 118\u00a0 would be lacking.\u00a0 The representation made\u00a0 by Pablo Rallonza, as plaintiff, and by\u00a0 Teodoro\u00a0 Evangelista, as defendant, can not bind their respective coowners, as regards the results of the trial, inasmuch as it\u00a0 is altogether illegal.\u00a0 The trial, considered from this\u00a0 point of view, was essentially null and void from the beginning.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is set aside, and it is ordered that a new trial be held wherein\u00a0 those interested in\u00a0 the lands in question shall be made parties,\u00a0 either as plaintiffs or as defendants.\u00a0 No special ruling is made as to the costs in this instance.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

The Chinaman replied: \"I do not owe you anything,\" took out his penknife, opened it, and raised his hand in the attitude of striking; that at this moment he, the accused, inflicted the fatal wound. The accused further testified that he did not know that the Chinaman was going to pass that place on that day; that he killed the Chinaman in order to defend himself and because he was tired of asking him to pay for the hemp; that he borrowed the bolo with which he killed the Chinaman from his grandfather, and further that Villarino was not present when he borrowed this bolo.<br\/><br\/>Basilio Riel, who was near by when this killing occurred, testified that he heard somebody cry \"juapia\" three times; that on hearing this cry he arose and saw the two men walking, one behind the other, the Chinaman being in front; that just at that moment he saw the Chinaman fall forward on his face, the cry and the fall of the Chinaman occurring almost at the same time.\u00a0\u00a0 This witness then ran away.<br\/><br\/>Zacarias Villarino, uncle of the accused and owner of the bolo with which the accused killed the Chinaman, testified that the accused came to his house about 8 o'clock on the morning of January 31 to borrow the bolo; that he refused to loan it to him, and that the accused thereupon took the bolo without his knowledge or consent, returning it that same afternoon; that at the time it was returned it had blood stains on the blade. He further testified that the accused is a left-handed person.<br\/><br\/>The accused was arrested on March 8, 1910, and taken before the auxiliary justice of the peace of the municipality of Carigara for a preliminary investigation. After the complaint, charging him with the murder of this Chinaman, had been read and interpreted to him, he pleaded guilty to the charge. After entering this plea of guilty he, according to the testimony of the auxiliary justice of the peace and another witness who was present, gave a detailed statement of how the killing occurred, stating that he had sold the Chinaman a certain amount of hemp; that the deceased Chinaman had defrauded him in the weight of this hemp; that on this account he held a grudge against the Chinaman and longed for an opportunity to meet him alone; that on the morning of the killing he learned that the Chinaman was going to pass along the beach; that he, after receiving this information, borrowed the bolo from Villarino and hid himself near the path where the deceased would pass and remained there until he came along; that he allowed the Chinaman to pass him about three steps when he then sprang out behind him and struck him a blow on the left side of the neck. During the trial in the Court of First Instance the accused denied having made these statements to the auxiliary justice of the peace.<br\/><br\/>The testimony of the auxiliary justice of the peace is corroborated in every detail by Urbano Banez, a lieutenant of Constabulary, who was present during this preliminary investigation. Both of these witnesses testified that these statements of the accused were made freely and voluntarily. This confession, made by the accused during the preliminary investigation, is corroborated in part by the witness Basilio Riel who heard the Chinaman cry out, saw the accused immediately behind the Chinaman, and saw him (the Chinaman) fall. The accused himself admitted on the trial that he killed the Chinaman partly on account of his refusal to pay him, the accused, for the hemp. He is a left-handed person and could not have very easily inflicted this wound while facing the deceased, the wound being on the left side of the neck. This fact is a strong circumstance showing that the accused was actually behind the Chinaman when he dealt the fatal blow. We think the testimony fully establishes the fact that the accused, feeling himself aggrieved by having been, as he thought, defrauded out of a part of the value of his hemp by the deceased, and having learned that the deceased was going to pass alone along the beach that day, secured the bolo, secreted himself, and awaited the coming of the Chinaman, and that immediately after the Chinaman passed him he sprang out and dealt the blow from behind the Chinaman. The deceased evidently did not know that the accused was in that vicinity and had no opportunity to defend himself. In killing this Chinaman the accused employed means which directly secured the death of the deceased without any risk on his part. These facts clearly establish the qualifying circumstance of <i>alevosia<\/i>, which raises the crime to murder. In the commission of this crime the aggravating circumstance of known premeditation has also been established, inasmuch as the accused deliberately formulated the plan to kill this Chinaman, having borrowed the bolo early in the morning and secreting himself near the path where the Chinaman would pass, remained there until he came along. The aggravating circumstance of <i>despoblado<\/i> has not been established, inasmuch as it has not been clearly shown that there were no houses in that vicinity or people living near by. We think the entire record demonstrates that the provisions of article 11 of the Penal Code should be applied in this case.<br\/><br\/>For the above reasons, and applying the provisions of article 11 of the Penal Code, the accused is hereby sentenced to <i>cadena perpetua. <\/i>\u00a0 With this modification the judgment of the lower court is affirmed, with costs against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

The bill of costs as presented by the attorney for the prevailing party contained several items which were objected to by the attorney for the unsuccessful party upon the ground that they were not items which could properly be taxed under the law and the practice of the court or, if proper, they were taxed excessively. <p>By agreement between the parties the question of the legality of these items of costs was submitted directly to the court.<\/p> <p>The said items were allowed by an order of the court below dated the 9th of January, 1909. From that order this appeal is taken.<\/p> <p>As to all of the items, except the one set out below, there is no evidence whatever in the record from which this court can say whether or not they are excessive. We are not able, therefore, to determine whether or not such items were properly allowed by the court below. In such case we must assume that the court below had facts before it sufficient to sustain a finding allowing those items.<\/p> <p>As to the item of P600 allowed by the court below as fees of the attorney, we are of the opinion that that item can not be allowed. The second paragraph of section 27 of the Election Law [Act No. 1582] reads as follows:<\/p> <blockquote> <p>\"Before the court shall entertain any such motion the party making it shall give a bond in an amount to be fixed by the court with two sureties satisfactory to it, conditioned that he will pay all expenses and costs incident to such motion, or shall deposit cash in court in lieu of such bond. If the party paying such expenses and costs shall be successful they shall be taxed by the court and entered and be collectible as a judgment against the defeated party.\"<\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>We do not believe that the words \"expenses and costs\" cover attorneys' fees. The word \"expenses\" as used in the Election Law has the same signification as the word \"disbursements.\" It does not include fees of attorneys. The amount of costs to which a party is entitled in the Courts of First Instance is regulated by section 492 of the Code of Civil Procedure. It will be seen from the provisions of that section that attorneys' fees are not allowed as costs in Courts of First Instance, so that attorneys' fees can not be included in the word \"costs.\" The item of P600, not being included in either the word \"costs\" or the word \"expenses\" as used in the statute, must, therefore, be disallowed.<\/p> <p>The judgment of the court below is hereby modified by striking from the bill of costs allowed therein the item of P600, and, as so amended, affirmed, without special finding as to the costs of this instance.<\/p> <p><em>Arellano, C.

B, Jeffrey appeared therein, and,\u00a0 without any apparent reason whatever, struck the woman three\u00a0 times on the hip\u00a0 with a bottle that he was carrying,\u00a0 in consequence of\u00a0 which the woman fell to the ground with an abundant hemorrhage from the womb; she was immediately taken to her home in a <i>carretela,<\/i> and being three months pregnant she had a miscarriage on the following day, according to the examination made by the president of the municipal board of health.\u00a0 The woman was ill and unable to attend to her\u00a0 usual duties for forty-five days.<br\/><br\/>Therefore\u00a0 a complaint\u00a0 was filed by the provincial fiscal with the Court\u00a0 of First Instance of said province on the 5th of June,\u00a0 1909, charging D. B. Jeffrey with the crime of <i>lesiones menos graves<\/i>, whereupon these\u00a0 proceedings were instituted.\u00a0 The trial court sentenced the accused, on the 19th of August, 1909, to the penalty of forty-five days of <i>arresto mayor,<\/i> to pay a fine of 325 pesetas,\u00a0 to indemnify the injured\u00a0 woman\u00a0 in the sum of P50,\u00a0 and, in case of insolvency in the payment of the fine and the indemnity, to suffer the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment, not, however, to exceed one-third\u00a0 of the main penalty, and to pay the costs.\u00a0 From this\u00a0 judgment\u00a0 defendant's counsel has appealed.<br\/><br\/>From the facts above related it is clearly shown that the crime of abortion, defined and punished by article 411 of the Penal Code, has been committed,\u00a0 inasmuch as, in consequence of the maltreatment received, on the evening of March 1, 1900, by Teodorica Saguinsin, a married woman who for three\u00a0 months\u00a0 had been\u00a0 pregnant,\u00a0 she fell\u00a0 to the ground, and had a severe hemorrhage and, being unable to\u00a0 return to her home, was taken there in a vehicle, with the assistance of Basilisa Pascual, who witnessed the occurrence.\u00a0 On the following day she had a miscarriage, as certified by the president of the municipal board of health of the town of San Pedro Macati who made an\u00a0 examination of and attended the victim of the maltreatment.<br\/><br\/>The defendant pleaded not guilty and denied the charge made in the case, although\u00a0 he admitted that on the night in question he had a dispute with the injured woman because he collided with her on\u00a0 the road, and he then\u00a0 simply gave her a little push with the index finger of the right hand in the back of her body,\u00a0 but without illtreating her,\u00a0 even though he carried a bottle at the time.\u00a0\u00a0 The foregoing statements to a certain extent confirm the charge that the woman was maltreated or struck three times upon the hips by the accused with the bottle that he was carrying, which fact is corroborated\u00a0 by the\u00a0 testimony of\u00a0 the witnesses.\u00a0 The testimony of the military surgeon, Raymond\u00a0 F. Metcalf, who, seven\u00a0 days\u00a0 thereafter, examined the injured woman and stated that he did not discover upon her body any signs of abortion, has not affected the preponderance of the evidence offered\u00a0 by the prosecution,\u00a0 inasmuch as, after the lapse of seven\u00a0 days, the miscarriage\u00a0 having occurred the day following the night when the woman was brutally struck upon the hips with a bottle, it is not strange that he did not find any traces of the hemorrhage or of the miscarriage, as seen by the physician who examined and attended the maltreated woman and certified to the fact of the abortion.<br\/><br\/>Even though it was not the criminal\u00a0 intent of the defendant to cause the abortion, the fact that, without any apparent reason whatever,\u00a0 he maltreated Teodorica\u00a0 Saguinsin, presumably not knowing that she was\u00a0 pregnant, as author of the abuse which caused the miscarriage, he is liable not only for such maltreatment but also for the consequences thereof, to wit, for the abortion; and it was also proven that on the said occasion the defendant was drunk, which circumstance explains how he came to strike\u00a0 the woman with a bottle without any known motive.\u00a0 It does not appear that he is an\u00a0 habitual drunkard.\u00a0 The penalty of <i>prision\u00a0 correccional<\/i> as\u00a0 fixed by the\u00a0 aforesaid article should be imposed upon him in the minimum degree, owing to presence of circumstance 6 of article 9 of the Penal\u00a0 Code, there\u00a0 being no aggravating circumstance to counteract its effect.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the question as\u00a0 to whether\u00a0 or\u00a0 not\u00a0 D. B. Jeffrey, having been accused of the crime of l<i>esiones menos graves, <\/i>can be lawfully sentenced for the crime of abortion, one which is distinct from that of lesiones, it is\u00a0 proper to consider that the complaint filed by the fiscal reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"The undersigned fiscal\u00a0 of\u00a0 the Province of Rizal,\u00a0 P. I., hereby charges\u00a0 D.\u00a0 B.\u00a0 Jeffrey with\u00a0 the\u00a0 crime of <i>lesiones menos graves<\/i> committed as follows: In that on the 1st day of March,\u00a0 1909, in\u00a0 the municipality\u00a0 of San Pedro Macati, Province of Rizal, P. L, the said D. B. Jeffrey, the accused herein, wilfully, unlawfully, and feloniously assaulted Teodorica Saguinsin, maltreating and striking her about the hips which\u00a0 resulted in a\u00a0 serious hemorrhage\u00a0 followed by a miscarriage; the patient required medical attendance for more than eight days, and was unable to work\u00a0 for an equal period of time.\u00a0\u00a0 All contrary to law.\"<\/blockquote>The accused, attended by counsel, appeared before the Court\u00a0 of First\u00a0 Instance of Rizal, and the foregoing\u00a0 complaint\u00a0 was read to him and translated into English by the clerk of the court.\u00a0 Upon being asked by the court to plead thereto, he pleaded not guilty.<br\/><br\/>Hence,\u00a0 when the defendant was informed\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 complaint, he at once understood that, although he\u00a0 was charged with the\u00a0 crime of\u00a0 <i>lesiones menos\u00a0 graves,<\/i> the charge also included the fact that he had maltreated Teodorica Saguinsin, striking\u00a0 her\u00a0 about\u00a0 the hips, in consequence\u00a0 of which she had a hemorrhage which was followed by a miscarriage; the woman was confined and disabled for work\u00a0 during eight days and\u00a0 was attended\u00a0 by a\u00a0 physician.\u00a0\u00a0 Not a single fact constituting the crime\u00a0 of <i>lesiones<\/i> is alleged\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 complaint, and there can be no question\u00a0 that, because of the translation into English, the accused must have heard and. known that the charge against him was that he had struck and maltreated the injured woman who,\u00a0 as a result of his unlawful act, suffered an abundant hemorrhage and a subsequent miscarriage.\u00a0 For this reason, when the defendant denied the charge and plead not guilty, he defended himself against the charge which consisted in that, in\u00a0 consequence of,having struck her with a bottle, he caused the abortion; and, inasmuch as the maltreatment and the miscarriage that followed in consequence thereof have been proved,\u00a0 it\u00a0 is perfectly just and legal\u00a0 that the\u00a0 penalty to be applied\u00a0 shall be that fixed by the law for the crime shown by the evidence and which the accused actually committed.<br\/><br\/>For\u00a0 the reasons\u00a0 above set forth, and holding\u00a0 that the crime committed is that of abortion and not that of lesiones, it is our opinion\u00a0 that the judgment appealed from should be set aside, and that the accused should be and\u00a0 he\u00a0 is hereby sentenced to the penalty of eight months of <i>prision correccional,<\/i> to indemnify the injured woman in the\u00a0 sum of\u00a0 P50, with subsidiary imprisonment in case\u00a0 of insolvency, and to pay the costs of both instances.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

That some time in the month of December, his wife, Clemencia Morales, died intestate.<br\/><br\/>Third. That\u00a0 at the time of the death of Jorge Capricho he was\u00a0 indebted to the defendant,\u00a0 Mariano\u00a0 Natividad, in the sum of\u00a0 P486.94.<br\/><br\/>Fourth. That after the death of\u00a0 Jorge Capricho and on or about the 15th of\u00a0 October, the said Mariano Natividad and\u00a0 Clemencia Morales liquidated\u00a0 the account\u00a0 which the said Natividad held against the estate of Jorge Capricho, which liquidation showed that there was\u00a0 due\u00a0 from the said estate to\u00a0 Mariano Natividad the\u00a0 sum\u00a0 of P486.94.\u00a0 This indebtedness was evidenced by a written promise\u00a0 to pay, signed by Clemencia\u00a0 Morales, and\u00a0 also a promise\u00a0 in case of failure to pay to pledge certain carabaos for the payment of the said indebtedness.<br\/><br\/>Fifth.\u00a0 That after the death\u00a0 of Clemencia\u00a0 Morales (the date does not appear of record) one Sotero\u00a0 Morales, was duly appointed as administrator of said\u00a0 estate.<br\/><br\/>Sixth.\u00a0 That on the\u00a0 10th\u00a0 day\u00a0 of August, 1903, in\u00a0 accordance\u00a0 with the\u00a0 provisions\u00a0 of section\u00a0 669 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions, the court appointed a committee composed of Benito Soriano and Domingo Bertram, to appraise the estate of the deceased and allow claims\u00a0 against the said estate.\u00a0\u00a0 (See\u00a0 record, p.\u00a0 37.)\u00a0\u00a0 The record does not contain the report of this committee.\u00a0 It is possible that the original records\u00a0 were\u00a0 not presented as a part of the record in the present case, for the reason that\u00a0 they were burned at the time the government building in the Province of Tarlac was burned.<br\/><br\/>Seventh. The first\u00a0 administrator, Sotero Morales, presented an inventory\u00a0 of the\u00a0 property of said estate (see record, p. 48),\u00a0 on the 5th day of January, 1907.\u00a0 There is nothing in the record which shows\u00a0 why the said inventory had not been filed with the court earlier; neither does the record show whether\u00a0 or not such inventory had been filed and had been burned at the time of the\u00a0 burning of said government building.<br\/><br\/>On the same day\u00a0 (the 5th of January, 1907)\u00a0 the said administrator (Morales) rendered his final account as such administrator and asked the court\u00a0 to\u00a0 confirm\u00a0 the same in accordance with\u00a0 sections 681 and 682 of the Code\u00a0 of Procedure\u00a0 in Civil Actions.\u00a0\u00a0 The record does\u00a0 not disclose what action the court took upon this account rendered.<br\/><br\/>The inventory presented\u00a0 by\u00a0 the administrator,\u00a0 Sotero Morales, in paragraph 8 contained a statement that there existed\u00a0 seven carabaos belonging to the\u00a0 said estate, of the value of P560.\u00a0 The said account rendered by Morales,\u00a0 in paragraph\u00a0 5, shows\u00a0 that three of these carabaos had\u00a0 been delivered to Mariano Natividad \"en garantia de una deuda,\" but it does not show when said carabaos had been delivered to the said Mariano Natividad.\u00a0\u00a0 The fact\u00a0 however, exists, and it is not\u00a0 denied that the carabaos were delivered by the\u00a0 administrator, Morales, to Natividad, within\u00a0 a few weeks after the death of Clemencia Morales and that the said Natividad had\u00a0 been in\u00a0 possession\u00a0 of said carabaos from that date, probably in the month of December, 1902, up to and including\u00a0 the time of the commencement of the present action\u00a0 (July 10, 1907.)<br\/><br\/>Eight. Later Sotero\u00a0 Morales\u00a0 died; the\u00a0 exact date\u00a0 does not appear, and the plaintiff herein was appointed as administrator of said\u00a0 estate.\u00a0\u00a0 The date of the appointment of the plaintiff does not appear.\u00a0 Exhibit A, which is alleged to have been a copy of his appointment, does not appear in the record.<br\/><br\/>The contention\u00a0 of\u00a0 the plaintiff is\u00a0 that\u00a0 Sotero\u00a0 Morales, the first administrator, had no authority to pay the claim of Mariano Natividad against the estate, by delivering\u00a0 to him the carabaos in question, without the express permission of the court.\u00a0 This contention of the plaintiff is valid, The plaintiff contends that\u00a0 it was the duty\u00a0 of\u00a0 Mariano Morales, if he had a claim\u00a0 against the estate\u00a0 in question, to have presented it to the committee appointed for the purpose of allowing claims.\u00a0 This contention of the plaintiff is also valid.\u00a0 It is not disputed, however,\u00a0 by the plaintiff that the carabaos were turned over to Natividad\u00a0 by the first administrator, Sotero Morales, and accepted by Natividad in good faith, believing that\u00a0 the carabaos\u00a0 had been turned\u00a0 over to him in\u00a0 part payment of his claim against the said estate.\u00a0 Sotero Morales, in his\u00a0 account rendered makes\u00a0 the statement\u00a0 that\u00a0 there were\u00a0 no debts existing against the said estate.\u00a0 (See record, p. 50.)<br\/><br\/>The simple question presented by the record is - Can an administrator maintain an action to recover personal property belonging to\u00a0 an estate, which has been in the possession of the defendant for a period of more than four years, he possessing the same in good faith?\u00a0 The defendant had held the property continuously from\u00a0 probably\u00a0 some\u00a0 time in the month of December, 1902, (certainly not later)\u00a0 up to and\u00a0 including\u00a0 the\u00a0 time of the\u00a0 commencement\u00a0 of the present action, July 10, 1907, and no question\u00a0 is\u00a0 raised here that the defendant did\u00a0 not possess the property in question in good\u00a0 faith.\u00a0 Article\u00a0 1955 of\u00a0 the Civil\u00a0 Code provides that\u00a0 \"The ownership of\u00a0 personal property prescribes\u00a0 by uninterrupted possession in\u00a0 good faith,\u00a0 for a period of three years.\"\u00a0 Paragraph 3 of section 43 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions provides that an action for the recovery of personal\u00a0 property shall be limited to four years. Without,\u00a0 at this\u00a0 time, attempting to discuss the effect of the\u00a0 provisions of said section\u00a0 43\u00a0 upon the provisions\u00a0 of said section 1955 of the Civil Code, and expressly\u00a0 reserving\u00a0 that\u00a0 question for future discussion, we are of the opinion and\u00a0 so hold that under the facts in the present case, the right of the\u00a0 plaintiff to recover the carabaos in question can not be sustained, and therefore the judgment of the lower court is hereby reversed, and without any special finding as to costs.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

He further testified that none of the appellants had resided in any other place except the municipality aforesaid during the thirty or thirty- two years that the witness had lived in Sagnay.<br\/><br\/>Baldomero Claudio, 58 years of age, testified that he had lived in Sagnay ever since the year 1862; that he had held the office of cabeza de barangay in the year 1870 and again in the year 1889, He testified that he knew thirty of the appellants and that none of them had held the office of municipal captain, gobernadorcillo, alcalde, lieutenant, <i>cabeza de barangay,<\/i> or member of any <i>ayuntamiento<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>Francisco Algarate, 38 years of age, justice of the peace of Sagnay, testified that he had lived in that municipality since the year 1891; that he knew personally each one of the appellants except six; that those six he knew by sight; that none of the appellants had ever held the office of municipal captain,<i> gobernadorcillo,<\/i> <i>alcalde,<\/i> lieutenant, <i>cabeza de barangay, <\/i>or member of any <i>ayuntamiento.<\/i> He testified further that he knew of his own knowledge that none of the appellants speak, read, and write English or Spanish correctly. The witness was specific and certain in his testimony, inasmuch as he had for a long time been employed by the municipality as a clerk or in some other capacity and had thereby had full and frequent opportunity to acquire information on that subject.<br\/><br\/>Jose Flores, deputy treasurer of the Province of Ambos Camarines, testified that the tax books of the province showed that none of thirty-five of the appellants whom he named owned property assessed in his name upon said books as required by said law; that said books showed that each one of twenty-six of the appellants whom he named owned or possessed real estate assessed upon said books in his name, but less in value than P500. There was presented in evidence a certified copy of the tax book of the municipal treasurer which discloses the value of the real estate possessed by those of the appellants who own property.<br\/><br\/>Gregorio Almazan, deputy municipal treasurer of the municipality of Sagnay, charged with the collection of the established taxes for the province, testified that none of the appellants had paid internal-revenue taxes amounting to the sum of P30. A certified copy of the books showing this fact was introduced in evidence.<br\/><br\/>Nicomedes Chavez, municipal treasurer of Sagnay, corroborated the testimony of the last witness in regard to the fact that none of the accused paid the established taxes in the municipality of Sagnay in an amount equal to P30. <br\/><br\/>It thus appears proved by the best evidence procurable that not one of the appellants in this case possessed, on the 2d day of November, 1909, any of the qualifications required by the section of the Election Law above referred to.\u00a0\u00a0 The prosecution had the difficult office of proving a negative. In making proof under such circumstances it has, perhaps, not presented either the best evidence or the completest evidence. This, however, is due to the fact that what may be considered, technically speaking, the best or the completest evidence is entirely within the control of the appellants themselves, who refused to produce, or, at least, refrained from producing, it. Under such circumstances, there rests upon the prosecution the necessity of producing simply the best evidence obtainable under the circumstances. That such evidence may not be the best evidence, legally speaking, is no fault of the prosecution. That inability is the result of the attitude of the appellants themselves. Under such circumstances the prosecution need do no more primarily than make a <i>prima facie<\/i> case from the best evidence obtainable under the circumstances. Justice and the law require of the people only that they establish, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">prima facie<\/span>, the guilt of the accused by producing for that purpose the best evidence within their power. If that evidence is otherwise free from legal objection or exception, it may properly serve as the basis of a conviction.<br\/><br\/>An accused person sometimes owes a duty to himself if not to the State. If he does not perform that duty he may not always expect the State to perform it for him. If he fails to meet the obligation which he owes to himself, when to meet it is the easiest of easy things, he is hardy indeed if he demand and expect that same full and wide consideration which the State voluntarily gives to those who by reasonable effort seek to help themselves. This is particularly so when , he not only declines to help himself but actively conceals from the State the very means by which it may assist him.<br\/><br\/>Under the Election Law of these Islands, there is no presumption that anybody is entitled to vote. In fact, the contrary presumption prevails. This presumption, taken in connection with the evidence of the prosecution, clearly and effectively establishes a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">prima facie<\/span> case against the appellants. Their conviction naturally and necessarily follows, unless they overcome the effect of the case made against them. In order to meet a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">prima facie<\/span> case, that is, in order to destroy its effect and shift the burden of producing further evidence, the party denying it must produce evidence tending to negative the claim asserted to a point where, if no more evidence be given, his adversary can not win by a preponderance of evidence in a civil case, and beyond a reasonable doubt in a criminal case. In this case it was only necessary for the accused for a complete destruction of the complainant's <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">prima facie<\/span> case to take the stand and, by a few words, bring themselves within the provisions of the law. No hardship was imposed upon them. No advantage was taken of them. (U. S. <i>vs,<\/i> Chan Toco, 12 Phil. Rep., 262.)<br\/><br\/>Where the subject-matter of a negative averment in an indictment, or a fact relied upon by defendant as a justification or excuse, relates to him personally or otherwise lies peculiarly within his knowledge, the general rule is that the burden of proof as to such averment or fact is on him. (The People <i>vs.<\/i> Boo Doo Hong, 122 Cal., 606; Com. <i>vs.<\/i> Thurlow, 24 Pick., 374; State <i>vs<\/i>. Wilson, 62 Kan., 621; United States <i>vs<\/i>. Chan Toco, <i>supra.<\/i>)<br\/><br\/>None of the appellants took the stand as a witness in his own behalf. The case made out by the prosecution remains entirely unmet.<br\/><br\/>The appellants call attention to the fact that the trial court, after the proofs had been closed and the arguments made, reopened the case for the purpose of recalling Francisco Algarate, a witness for the prosecution. The testimony given by this witness on recall does nothing more than corroborate that given by him upon his first examination. This court has already held that the trial court, exercising his discretion within reasonable limits, may reopen the case for the purpose of hearing further proofs upon either side, (U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Cinco, 8 Phil. Rep., 388.) The appellants have not shown that they were prejudiced in any way by the act complained of. In fact, the exact contrary appears from the record.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the appellants asserts that even though it has been shown by the prosecution that the appellants voted illegally, nevertheless, the record fails to demonstrate that they did so knowing that they were not qualified voters. He asserts, in other words, that, to sustain a conviction, it is necessary to prove not only that the appellants voted illegally but, in addition, that they voted knowing their lack of qualification. It is well known that a presumption of criminal intention may arise from proof of the commission of an unlawful act, it being the general rule that, if it is proved that the accused committed the unlawful act charged, it will be presumed that the act was done with a criminal intention, and that it is for the accused to rebut this presumption. While there are certain crimes of which a specific intent to accomplish a particular purpose is an essential element and for which there can be no conviction upon proof of mere general malice or criminal intent, the case at bar does not fall within that class. It is a wellsettled principle that everyone is presumed to know the law of the land, and that one's ignorance of it furnishes no exemption from criminal responsibility for his acts. The appellants, therefore, necessarily knew the law which prohibited them from voting unless they had the qualifications expressed in the law. They knew also, and that far better than anyone else, whether or not they actually had those qualifications. The necessary consequence is that when they voted they voted knowingly. They, being fully aware of their lack of qualifications when they voted, may not now be heard to plead their ignorance. No one may be heard to plead ignorance of a fact which from the nature of things he must necessarily know better than anyone else.<br\/><br\/>In the case of the United States <i>vs<\/i>. Concepcion (13 Phil. Rep., 21) it appeared - <br\/><blockquote>\"That on the 28th day of June, 1907, said accused were holding the office of election inspectors for the first precinct of the municipality of Calibo, Province of Capiz, the three persons above named constituting the board of inspectors of said precinct, and as such board of inspectors they held on the aforesaid day an ordinary meeting in the precinct of the municipality of Calibo, for the purpose of registering the voters duly qualified in said precinct for the election of a Delegate to the first Philippine Assembly; that Juan Policarpio, being a duly qualified voter of said precinct, appeared before the said inspectors and asked that he be registered as a voter; but that the said inspectors willfully, intentionally, illegally, and feloniously refused and prevented the registration of the name of Juan Policarpio in the registry, and refused to administer to him the elector's oath prescribed by section 17 of the Election Law, thereby violating the provisions of section 29 of the said law.\"<\/blockquote>Upon an appeal to this court from a judgment of conviction, this court, after quoting the provision of the law applicable to the case, said (pp. 25-26):<br\/><blockquote>\"It will be noted that this paragraph provides that if any inspector <i>knowingly<\/i> enters, etc., the name of any person as a voter, etc, who is not a voter, or who refuses or willfully votes to refuse or willfully neglects to enter the name of any qualified applicant, etc., shall be punished.<br\/><br\/>\"It will be noted that in said section 17, above quoted, the board of inspectors were given the right to decide in the first instance whether or not a particular applicant for registration was legally entitled to be registered or not. This authority is in the nature of a judicial capacity conferred upon the inspectors. Having thus been given judicial capacity or quasi-judicial capacity to decide the question whether or not a particular applicant is entitled to register, we are of the opinion, and so hold, that such inspectors of election can not be punished under the provisions of section 29 until it is shown, beyond question, that such inspectors <i>knowingly, willfully,<\/i> and <i>maliciously<\/i> entered upon the poll list or <i>knowingly, willfully<\/i>, and <i>maliciously refused to permit <\/i>the entry upon such list of the name of any applicant for registration.<br\/><br\/>\"Under the provisions of the law evidently the inspectors of election have a right not only to call witnesses for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not a particular applicant is entitled to be registered, but they may act upon their own knowledge with reference to the qualifications of such applicant, and if they act honestly and without willfulness or maliciousness they can not be held to be criminally responsible. It is only when they knowingly, willfully, and maliciously register or refuse or vote to refuse to register one who is not entitled to be registered or one who is entitled to be registered that they can be punished criminally. The mere fact that they have registered or refused or voted to refuse to register one who is entitled to be registered or one who is not entitled to be registered is not sufficient, under the law, to make the inspectors of election criminally responsible. It must be shown, beyond peradventure of doubt, that the acts of said inspectors in such a case were done knowingly, willfully, and maliciously.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It will be seen at a glance that that case is no authority for the position taken by counsel for the appellants. There the appellants voted upon the facts presented to them. They had no knowledge outside of those facts. They acted, in a sense, judicially. Mere proof that they made a mistake in judgment as to the legal significance of those facts is no proof whatever of willfulness, or of a specific intention to commit a wrong. Men's judgments may differ upon the probative value of facts. Two men, equally honest, may draw different legal conclusions from the same facts. Proof that the appellants decided one way and not another is no evidence that they decided wrongly. Proof that they were actually wrong in their judgment upon the facts is no proof of intention to commit a crime. But, even if it were, the knowledge or the intent to commit a crime need not be proved specifically. It may be inferred from circumstances. The case at bar is quite different in its essential nature from the one cited. In the case at bar there is no requirement that the appellants' judgment be exercised.\u00a0\u00a0 There is no necessity for the drawing of inferences or the use of discretion upon facts presented. As we have already stated, the appellants knew the law and knew the facts. The act of voting was, therefore, done knowingly and willfully.<br\/><br\/>Neither can the case of the United States <i>vs<\/i>. Lopez (14 Phil. Rep., 155) be successfully cited in favor of the contention of the appellants. The court in that case said (pp. 156-158);<br\/><blockquote>\"Paragraph 7 of section 29 of the Election Law reads:<br\/><br\/>\" 'Any person who knowing that he is disqualified assumes any office shall be punished by a fine of not less than five hundred pesos nor more than one thousand pesos.'<br\/><br\/>\"It is an undoubted fact that the accused, according to an official letter signed by a deputy of the provincial treasurer of Occidental Negros (folio 14), was required to pay the land tax due for the year 1905 on the 19th of July, 1907, and for that purpose delivered on the same day, a Friday, to Pedro Puentebella, who was in charge of his estate, the sum of P110.52, which was the amount of the tax owed by him, to be paid by the latter to the municipal treasurer. On the following day, Saturday, the 20th of July, as the accused was going by the house of his manager, on his hacienda, he asked him if the said tax had been paid to the aforesaid treasurer, to which Puentebella replied in the affirmative, whereupon Lopez went on his way in the direction of Silay. This appears from the testimony of the defendant, confirmed by his manager Puentebella, although it is also a fact that the aforesaid amount was not paid into the municipal treasury, nor did the treasurer receive it on the said date for the reason that Puentebella failed to find the said official when he called at his office and the money was delivered to Simplicio Adeva, a clerk in said treasury, and believing that the latter had turned it over to the said treasurer, Puentebella, when questioned on the following day, the 20th of July, by the accused, Marciano Lopez, replied that the tax had been paid as ordered by him.<br\/><br\/>\"From the foregoing facts which have been duly proven it would appear that when the accused took the oath on the morning of Monday, the 22d of July, and took possession of the office of acting municipal president of Silay, he did so believing that he was not a delinquent taxpayer, and that he had paid his indebtedness three days before, basing his belief on the affirmative answer given him by his manager when he asked the latter on the following day if the sum handed him on the day before had been paid into the municipal treasury.<br\/><br\/>\"In order to establish the fact that the defendant, Marciano Lopez, knowing that he was a delinquent taxpayer and as such ineligible.to hold the office of municipal president, nevertheless took the oath, stating that he possessed the necessary qualifications therefor, and actually entered upon his duties as municipal president of Silay, it is indispensable to prove that the accused performed said official acts in bad faith and with certain knowledge that, on the 22d day of July, he was still delinquent in the payment of the tax, which, according to his manager, had been paid on the 19th of the said month. The honest belief and firm conviction that his indebtedness to the Government had been paid on the 19th or 20th of July are incompatible with the charge preferred against him of having taken possession of the presidency with malicious intent to violate the Election Law.\"<\/blockquote>The distinction between the case just cited and the one at bar is evident. No words are needed to distinguish them. We might add, however, that in the case cited the court, when it said \"it is indispensable to prove that the accused performed said official acts in bad faith and with certain knowledge that, on the 22d day of July, he was still deliquent in the payment of the tax,\" did not mean that, in order to establish his guilt, it was necessary that a specific criminal intent, a guilty knowledge, apart from the general criminal intent which is presumed by the law from the act performed, be proved.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the contrary, it was held in that very case that the proof by the prosecution of the fact that the appellant was disqualified, without proving any knowledge upon his part of such disqualification, was sufficient to establish a <i>prima facie<\/i> case against him, and he was, for that reason, obliged, in order to meet the prima facie case thus made, to present facts which demonstrated that he had made a reasonable effort to pay the tax required by the law to make him eligible to the office, and honestly believed that that effort had been successful, and that he entered upon the discharge of the duties of the office under an honest mistake of fact induced by no fault of his own, but, rather, by the deception of a servant. What was held and decided in that case was that, the accused having been proved guilty, <i>prima facie,<\/i> by evidence showing his disqualification merely, and having then produced evidence in his own behalf demonstrating clearly that his act was a perfectly honest one, it was then incumbent upon the prosecution, before the accused could be convicted, to rebut and overcome such proof by showing \"that the accused performed said official acts in bad faith and with certain knowledge that, on the 22d day of July, he was still delinquent in the payment of the tax.\" That case did not hold that it was necessary for a conviction to show specifically <i>in the first instance<\/i> the guilty knowledge of the accused apart from the general criminal intent and guilty knowledge presumed by law from the act performed.<br\/><br\/>A case more nearly in point is that of United States <i>vs.<\/i> Maravilla (10 Phil. Rep., 233). In that case it was charged that - <br\/><blockquote>\"On the 29th day of June last the accused, in order to qualify as an elector in the elections held to fill the office of Delegate to the Philippine Assembly, maliciously and feloniously swore, among other things to the fact that he was not delinquent in the payment of any taxes, though in truth he had not paid the road tax for the ensuing year, as provided for by section 19 of Act No. 1396, the term for payment having already expired. This act was committed at Calapan, Mindoro, within the jurisdiction of this Court of First Instance, and contrary to the Election Law.\" The court quoted in its decision paragraph 4 of section 30 of the Election Law, which says:<br\/><br\/>\"Any person who knowingly takes or subscribes any false oath, affidavit, or affirmation before any election officer, or before any court or other officer in relation to any material fact in any registration or election proceeding, shall be punished by imprisonment for not less than three months nor more than five years, or by a fine of not less than two hundred pesos nor more than two thousand pesos, or both, in the discretion of the court.\"<\/blockquote>The court then said (pp. 239-240) :<br\/><blockquote>\"The only question presented by the appellant is whether or not he knowingly violated the provisions of said law; that is, whether he knew at the time he took the said oath that he was delinquent in the payment of said road tax. He admits that the law was read to him just before he took the oath. The law is plain. It simply provides that those who do not pay the tax 'shall be deemed to be delinquent after the first day of February of each year.' It seems to be difficult to understand the contention of the defendant. During the trial he admitted that the reason for not paying the tax for the year 1907, as he had done in the year 1906, was that he did not have the money.<br\/><br\/>\"Suppose, for instance, that the defendant had been prosecuted for a failure to pay said tax or to perform the work in lieu thereof, and had made as his defense in that action that he did not know that he was delinquent. Could he thereby have defeated the imposition of the penalties provided for in paragraph (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">b<\/span>) of said section 19 above quoted? In other words, could he have plead his ignorance of the law as his defense? Under the penal clause of paragraph (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">b<\/span>) of said section 19 he could only be punished upon the theory that he was delinquent.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We are not of the opinion that his ignorance of the provisions of the law would have constituted a defense in that action. And, moreover, the defendant resided in the capital of the province. The provincial treasurer, long prior to the 29th day of June, 1907, had prepared a list of the persons of the province who were delinquent in the payment of the said tax. Had the defendant been anxious to know, as a matter of fact, whether he was a delinquent or not, he might easily have ascertained this fact upon inquiry of the provincial treasurer. But, as was said above, the mere reading of the law was sufficient to give him the information that the said tax was due and payable prior to the 1st day of February of each year, and those who had not paid said tax prior to said date were delinquent.<br\/><br\/>\"From all of the facts disclosed by the record, we are of the opinion that the defendant did make the said affidavit knowing that he had not paid said tax in accordance with the law, and was therefore delinquent, and that, therefore, he knowingly took and subscribed to a false oath before the election officer. Those who desire to participate in the affairs of the Government must be willing to comply with its laws and to support the same.\"<\/blockquote>In conclusion, we again assert the proposition that when it was proved that the appellants committed the unlawful acts charged it was properly presumed that they were done with full knowledge and with criminal intention, and it was for the appellants to rebut that presumption. Not having done so, their conviction stands.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below is, therefore, affirmed, with costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa<\/i>, and <i>Carson, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><\/div>",

If for such reason the healing of the wounds required longer than if they had been properly treated,\u00a0 the defendant must suffer the\u00a0 consequences thereof, which in\u00a0 reality\u00a0 are no other than the consequences of his own act in inflicting the wounds; and\u00a0 it does not appear, nor is there the least indication that the injured man did anything to retard or to prolong their healing.\u00a0 He who executes\u00a0 an act must respond for all\u00a0 the consequences arising therefrom which can not be imputed to the fault of the injured party.\u00a0 As the injuries above alluded to\u00a0 required more than\u00a0 ninety days to heal, the crime should be classified as graves, not menos graves\u00a0 as erroneously concluded by the court below in the judgment appealed from,\u00a0 and it falls\u00a0 within paragraph\u00a0 3 of article 416 of the Penal Code.<br\/><br\/>It appears from the evidence that the injured party was entirely unable to\u00a0 take any precaution against the\u00a0 aggression of which he was the victim and which resulted in the injuries in question.\u00a0 He was\u00a0 engaged in a friendly conversation with other persons\u00a0 in the house of the defendant when he was suddenly attacked by the latter; not the least trouble,\u00a0 dispute, row, or anything in fact from\u00a0 which\u00a0 an aggression might\u00a0 have been feared or expected preceded the act.\u00a0 It was,\u00a0 owing\u00a0 to\u00a0 the\u00a0 sudden character of the attack, a markedly treacherous act, which brings the present case within the provisions of\u00a0 the last paragraph\u00a0 of said article 416 which, in relation\u00a0 with paragraph 3 of the same article,\u00a0 imposes the penalty\u00a0 of <i>prision correccional<\/i> in\u00a0 its medium and maximum degrees.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is hereby reversed, and the defendant is sentenced to the\u00a0 penalty\u00a0 of\u00a0 three\u00a0 years six months and twenty-one days\u00a0 of <i>prision correccional<\/i>, to pay the sum of P6 to Antonio Castro, president of the municipal board of health, for fees due him for the treatment of the wounds of the injured party,\u00a0 to indemnify the latter in the sum of\u00a0 P25, or\u00a0 to suffer subsidiary imprisonment\u00a0 in case of insolvency\u00a0 at the rate of one\u00a0 day's imprisonment for every twelve and a half pesetas that he fails\u00a0 to pay, with one-half of the period of his detention to be\u00a0 credited to him, and to pay the costs of this instance.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

As Mallari did not fulfill his agreement to deliver the value of the cloth or the cloth itself,\u00a0 should it not have been sold, the owner of the goods made a demand upon him, at the time the agreement was broken, and on several\u00a0 occasions afterwards, once in writing and the other times verbally through Nicolas Quiambao, for the return of the cloth or the delivery of its price; but\u00a0 Mallari always replied that the cloth was not yet sold, when Taliri knew that it was; wherefore the latter, believing that he was the victim of a fraud, made a complaint to the court of the justice of\u00a0 the peace of San Fernando, Pampanga,\u00a0 and the record of the proceedings in the case was afterwards\u00a0 forwarded to\u00a0 the Court of First Instance.<br\/><br\/>On the basis of the foregoing facts, the provincial fiscal, on November 5,\u00a0 1908, filed\u00a0 a complaint with the\u00a0 Court of First Instance of the\u00a0 said\u00a0 province charging\u00a0 the spouses Gregorio Mallari and Julia Sunga with the crime of<i> estafa,<\/i> and the cause having been tried, the judge, in\u00a0 view of the evidence adduced, rendered\u00a0 judgment therein\u00a0 on\u00a0 October 12, 1908, and sentenced each of the accused to the penalty of six months' <i>arresto mayor<\/i>, to the accessory penalties, to indemnify Emigdio Bundoc\u00a0 Taliri severally and jointly in the sum of P198, with subsidiary imprisonment in\u00a0 case of insolvency, and each to pay one-half of the costs.\u00a0\u00a0 Gregorio Mallari died on the\u00a0 4th of the said month of October, in the pueblo of Macabebe, wherefore, by order of December 24, 1908, the case was dismissed in so far as it concerned him, and an appeal was taken by the surviving defendant, Julia\u00a0 Sunga.<br\/><br\/>Starting from the hypothesis that due proof was actually adduced\u00a0 in this cause\u00a0 of the existence\u00a0 and reality of the crime\u00a0 of <i>estafa <\/i>herein charged, and of\u00a0 the\u00a0 guilt of\u00a0 the accused Gregorio Mallari, although, on\u00a0 account of the latter's death on October\u00a0 4,\u00a0 1908, a few days before the judgment\u00a0 appealed from was\u00a0 rendered,\u00a0 the case was dismissed with respect to the deceased, by order\u00a0 of December 23 of the same year (p. 101 of the record), withal the proceedings had in the case\u00a0 do not show full proof of the\u00a0 guilt of the other\u00a0 defendant, Julia Sunga, the\u00a0 wife\u00a0 of the\u00a0 deceased defendant, Gregorio Mallari, as a coprincipal of the crime under prosecution.<br\/><br\/>The circumstance of Julia Sunga's having been present when her husband Gregorio Mallari received from the aggrieved party the 66 pieces\u00a0 of embroidered <i>jusi<\/i> cloth, and when the instrument of contract was executed, expressive of the delivery and receipt of the cloth and of the obligation to deliver the price thereof, or to return the cloth, in case it should not have been sold by December 30, 1905,\u00a0 to its. owner,\u00a0 Emigdio Taliri, does not determine, on account\u00a0 of the husband's nonfulfilment of his agreement, criminal liability on the part of the wife.\u00a0\u00a0 Because she\u00a0 accompanied her husband on that occasion, it does not follow that she was criminally liable for\u00a0 the deceitful and fraudulent conduct of\u00a0 her\u00a0 husband, so\u00a0 long as it\u00a0 is not shown that the wife participated directly or even indirectly in the appropriation or abstraction of the cloth received\u00a0 for its sale on commission by the husband.<br\/><br\/>Between the document Exhibit A, on the one hand, which contains a\u00a0 copy of the memorandum written by the notary Simplicio Mangila on page 37, back, of the registry book of instruments executed\u00a0 or\u00a0 ratified\u00a0 in\u00a0 his office - a copy subscribed\u00a0 by the notary Cosme Garcia, because the said Mangila who wrote the\u00a0 copied memorandum afterwards died - and on the other hand, the Exhibit B, which is said to be a transcript or reproduction of\u00a0 the instrument alleged to have\u00a0 been\u00a0 executed by the said spouses and in which record was made of the receipt of the cloth and the agreement to return it\u00a0 or its\u00a0 value on December 30, 1905, since the authenticity\u00a0 of this document Exhibit B does not appear to have\u00a0 been\u00a0 proved at the trial, the\u00a0 contents, of the memorandum copied in Exhibit A must necessarily be relied upon, inasmuch as\u00a0 it is\u00a0 a proven fact\u00a0 that the defendant\u00a0 Julia Sunga did not appear before the notary\u00a0 to ratify the contents of\u00a0 the document alleged to have been written by the witness\u00a0\u00a0 Fulgencio Jaime\u00a0 which,\u00a0 having disappeared,\u00a0 was substituted by the Exhibit B, an imitation or reproduction of the same.\u00a0\u00a0 The memorandum copied in Exhibit A reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Don\u00a0\u00a0 Gregorio Mallari, executor of the instrument, D.

It would not be hazardous to affirm that were\u00a0 the notary Mangila\u00a0 now living he perhaps would\u00a0 not\u00a0 have exhibited the\u00a0 said document, Exhibit B,\u00a0 after\u00a0 the disappearance of\u00a0 its original authentically abstracted in the instrument Exhibit A.<br\/><br\/>The fraud or the deceit must not\u00a0 be looked for in the act of making the contract of commission and of executing the instrument\u00a0 annotated\u00a0 by the notary according to Exhibit A.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 malice and\u00a0 the elements constituting\u00a0 the crime of <i>estafa<\/i> supervened after the receipt\u00a0 of the cloth, and under this assumption the record of the cause does not disclose conclusive proof that Julia Sunga participated in the\u00a0 punishable acts committed by\u00a0 her husband who,\u00a0 according to the testimony of the aggrieved party himself,\u00a0 was\u00a0 the sole person who took charge of the cloth for the purpose of selling it on commission and came\u00a0 to terms of agreement with\u00a0 the\u00a0 owner\u00a0 thereof,\u00a0 wherefore the demands\u00a0 made through a third party in behalf of the offended person were addressed to the said Mallari.\u00a0 The criminal liability of the appellant can not be established by the circumstance\u00a0 that her name appears beside that of her husband in the charges preferred against the latter in connection\u00a0 with the alleged <i>estafa.<\/i><br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons,\u00a0 and in view\u00a0 of the fact that the trial of\u00a0 this cause disclosed no conclusive proof\u00a0 of the guilt of\u00a0 the defendant\u00a0 Julia\u00a0 Sunga, it\u00a0 is\u00a0 proper,\u00a0 in our opinion,\u00a0 with a reversal of the judgment\u00a0 appealed from, to\u00a0 absolve Julia\u00a0 Sunga,\u00a0 with the\u00a0 costs\u00a0 of both\u00a0 instances <i>de\u00a0 oficio<\/i>, and it is so ordered.<br\/><br\/><i> Arellano, C.

that the defendant company, upon being informed of said claim and of the\u00a0 decision rendered therein, took part, being the bidder at the\u00a0 sale of said property, and defended its right\u00a0 of possession,\u00a0 a proceeding which required an expenditure of P300, and that the plaintiff, being aware of the question in the matter of the possession of the said property, did not intervene or take\u00a0 any part therein; the defendants therefore prayed that they be absolved of the complaint, and that the plaintiff be estopped from claiming the said property, and that she be perpetually enjoined from further action,\u00a0 and\u00a0 sentenced to pay the costs\u00a0 of the proceedings.<br\/><br\/>The case came up for trial, evidence being adduced by both parties to the\u00a0 suit,\u00a0 and their exhibits and the arguments of their respective lawyers were made of record; on the 24th of April, 1908, the trial court rendered judgment against the plaintiff, and dismissed the complaint with costs.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff, upon being informed of the foregoing decision, excepted thereto and on the 25th of April moved for a new trial,\u00a0 requesting the court below to amend the said judgment, clearly and specifically stating the conclusions of fact that resulted from the evidence, and which served as the basis of the decision; and that\u00a0 a correction be made in the fourth paragraph of her complaint, causing it to appear that the plaintiff constructed a new camarin on the same spot where the\u00a0 camarin destroyed\u00a0 by the cyclone of 1904 formerly stood,\u00a0 in which new building some of the timbers of the old one were used.<br\/><br\/>On the same\u00a0 date, April 25th, the plaintiff presented a motion requesting a reopening and a new trial on the ground that the above judgment was not\u00a0 supported by and\u00a0 was openly and manifestly contrary to the weight of the\u00a0 evidence, to law and to equity,\u00a0 and\u00a0 because the testimony of the witnesses was not properly taken down by the stenographer, as required for a review of the said judgment.<br\/><br\/>On the 27th of April, the court below, on the ground that the facts stated in the judgment were sufficiently described therein,\u00a0 and\u00a0 in\u00a0 view\u00a0 of the fact that Attorney Imperial stated in the\u00a0 presence of the adverse party that it was unnecessary for the stenographer to take down the testimony of the witnesses who were examined at the trial, for which reason the plaintiff was not entitled to a new\u00a0 trial, over-ruled the two motions filed by the latter, who excepted to the order and to the final judgment and gave notice of intention to appeal.<br\/><br\/>The bill of exceptions was prepared, to the approval of which the appellee\u00a0 objected because it contained testimony of witnesses not included in the record of\u00a0 the case;\u00a0 the court below\u00a0 ruled\u00a0 that the bill be amended and the\u00a0 said testimony eliminated, but the appellant excepted thereto and again insisted that the amended bill of exceptions, with the testimony of the witnesses according to the minutes, should be approved.<br\/><br\/>The court\u00a0 below\u00a0 held that if the parties would agree in writing as to the testimony of the witnesses included in the bill of exceptions, the clerk\u00a0 of the court must submit\u00a0 the same to this court;\u00a0 that, in case of disagreement, then both parties should present their respective bills for the approval of the court below, which could not be done because\u00a0 the judge found that the notes were\u00a0 so brief that they did not comprise all\u00a0 of the said testimony; therefore, as the bills presented by the parties could not be corrected nor harmonized with certainty, it was ordered that all the documents be submitted to this court.<br\/><br\/>Section 1\u00a0 of Act No. 1596, enacted February 25, 1907, amending section 497 of Act No. 190, the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions, prescribes in paragraph 2, among other things, the following:<br\/><blockquote>\"If the excepting party filed a motion in\u00a0 the Court of First Instance for\u00a0 a\u00a0 new trial, upon the ground that the evidence\u00a0 was insufficient\u00a0 to\u00a0 justify the decision, and the judge overruled\u00a0 said motion, and due exception\u00a0 was taken to his overruling the same, the Supreme Court may review the evidence\u00a0 and make such findings upon the facts by a preponderance of the evidence, and render such final judgment\u00a0 as justice and equity may require.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Act No. 1123, enacted April 27, 1904, amending, among others, section 143 of said Act No. 190, provides in substitution of the penultimate paragraph the following:<br\/><blockquote>\"Immediately upon the allowance of a bill of exceptions by the judge, it shall be the duty of the clerk to transmit to the clerk of the Supreme Court the original bill of exceptions and all documents which by the bill of exceptions are made a part of\u00a0 it. The cause shall\u00a0 be heard in the Supreme Court upon the bill of exceptions so transmitted, all duly certified by the clerk\u00a0 of the\u00a0 Court of First Instance.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It is fixed doctrine which constitutes a rule established by this court, in accordance with the provisions of law above quoted, that if the appellant desires that the Supreme Court shall review the evidence offered at the trial, he must see that all the\u00a0 evidence is submitted to this court upon appeal.<br\/><br\/>He can not bring in a part of the evidence only and\u00a0 then claim a reversal on the\u00a0 ground that the evidence presented to this court does not support the judgment.\u00a0 (Ferrer <i>vs.<\/i> Abejuela, 9 Phil. Rep., 324; Valle <i>vs. <\/i> Galera, 10 Phil. Rep., 619.)\u00a0 The oral evidence taken\u00a0 in the present case has not been submitted to this court for the reason that, as stated in the order of the trial court of the 27th of April, 1908, Attorney Imperial for the plaintiff, as well as the attorney for the defendant,\u00a0 stated in open court that they did not desire\u00a0 the court stenographer to take down the testimony of the witnesses who had been\u00a0 examined; hence the judge believed that the representative of the plaintiff was not entitled to\u00a0 move for a new trial.\u00a0 It\u00a0 has\u00a0 not been possible for the appellant to have the\u00a0 clerk of the lower court transmit the oral evidence together with the documentary evidence, because it was not taken down at the trial, and for this reason the conclusions of fact in the judgment can not be reviewed,\u00a0 since\u00a0 to that\u00a0 end it would be necessary to examine all the\u00a0 evidence\u00a0 presented at the trial,\u00a0 and certainly this court has not before it the oral evidence.<br\/><br\/>The attorney who appeared for Francisca Breta, under agreement with the defendant's lawyer, expressly renounced the\u00a0 right to have\u00a0 the testimony of the witnesses taken down by the stenographer, for, even though no stenographer had been\u00a0 available, the testimony might\u00a0 have been taken in longhand\u00a0 or typewritten by a copyist, to which means the representative of the plaintiff did not have recourse,\u00a0 when, in the event of\u00a0 an unfavorable\u00a0 decision, it was his duty to assemble all the evidence and see that the same was\u00a0 all transmitted to this\u00a0 court, if he\u00a0 desired a review of the judgment, which could not be accomplished on account of the express waiver of the appellant, that is to say, through\u00a0 his\u00a0 fault.<br\/><br\/>Therefore\u00a0 we are forced to accept\u00a0 the\u00a0 reasoning and conclusions of the judge in the judgment appealed from.<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing, it is\u00a0 our opinion that the said judgment should be and\u00a0 is hereby\u00a0 affirmed,\u00a0 with\u00a0 costs against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

THE DIRECTOR OF LANDS, OBJECTOR AND APPELLANT.<br\/>\n<br\/>\nD E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">On the 17th of August, 1908, Mariano Escueta filed an application in the Court of Land Registration, soliciting the registration, in conformity with the Land Registration Act, of a property or parcel of land of which he was alleged to be the absolute owner, situated at No. 173 Calle Ilaya, of the district of Ton do, Manila, bounded on the north by property of Manuel Abreu and Juan Mauricio; on the northeast by Calle Ilaya; on the southeast by property of Susana Marquez, Macaria Villareal, and Donato Miguel; and on the southwest by property of Macario Cui-Malay and Timoteo Lanuza. The application states that this land contains 798'34,16 square meters, the description and boundaries of which are given in the detailed plan inclosed therewith; that there is no encumbrance of any kind on the said land, nor any person who may consider that he has a right to or a share in the same, according to the applicant's best knowledge and belief, and that the latter acquired the said property, through purchase, from Ildefonso Ramirez y Apostol, according to the deed ratified by the vendee, on May 8, 1908, before the notary public, Fermin Mariano. Among other particulars, the applicant states that he is the present occupant of the land. The application is accompanied by a plan of the land, a deed of sale executed by the said Ildefonso Ramirez in favor of the applicant, and another instrument executed by Telesfora Apostol in favor of the said Ramirez, on August 25, 1905, before the notary Fernando de la Cantera, recorded on folio 73 under No. 1045, fourth inscription; and by another instrument executed by the spouses Francisco Rojo and Susana Modesto, in favor of the aforementioned Telesfora Apostol, on July 7, 1903, before the notary public Calixto Reyes y Cruz, recorded on folio 72, back, of the registry, under No. 1045, third inscription.<br\/><br\/>After the conclusion of the regular legal procedure and the receipt of the report from the register of deeds, this case came up for hearing on the 15th of February, 1909, and at the trial the petitioner presented in evidence several documents which were admitted by the court. In view of the proofs so presented the judge, on the same date, issued an order decreeing the adjudication and registration of the said property in accordance with the petition of Mariano Escueta y Bernabe.<br\/><br\/>On the 23d of the same month, the petitioner stated in writing to the court that, after the hearing, he had learned that the true boundaries of his land on its southeastern side were the properties of Susana Marquez, Macaria Villareal, Protasio Cabrera, and of the deceased Gregorio Pineda, these two latter instead of Donato Miguel Castro; that the said Protasio Cabrera was then residing at Boac, Marinduque, and was represented in this city by his sister, Placida Cabrera, domiciled at No. 152 Calle de Uaya, Tondo, and that the deceased Gregorio Pineda was represented by his judicial administratrix, Ignacia Lopez, residing at No. 105 Calle Folgueras, Tondo; that both representatives of the said adjacent property owners agreed to the amendment which he petitioned to have made in the description of his land; that the measurements and true degrees of the said southeastern side were those given in the writing, and that in view of the amendments specified the area of the land should be\u00a0 806'40,17\u00a0 square meters\u00a0 instead of 798'34,16 square meters, as appeared on the plan attached and which was annexed to the application. The petitioner therefore asked the court to admit the amendments aforestated. The court, on March 18, ordered that the honorable Attorney-General should be granted a hearing on the aforesaid petition, so that he might make such opposition thereto as he deemed proper, and in order that the case might be forwarded to the Supreme Court.<br\/><br\/>The Attorney-General, by a writing of March 27, 1909, and for the reasons therein expressed, opposed the amendments solicited by the petitioner, except upon a new description of the land, other due notifications and previous publication.<br\/><br\/>By another writing of the same date, the Attorney-General excepted to the judgment rendered in the case, announced his intention to file a bill of exceptions, and asked for a new trial, on the grounds that the court's findings of fact were manifestly contrary to the weight of the evidence, and further stating that the latter did not sufficiently justify the said judgment, which, he declared, was also contrary to law. A date was set for the hearing of the motion for a new trial.<br\/><br\/>After a red line had been drawn on the plan, Exhibit A, by the surveyor of the court, as provided by order of August 23, 1909, on the 28th of the same month a decision was rendered by the court granting the proposed amendment solicited, without new advertisement or notifications, and disallowing the claim made by the Director of Lands. The Attorney-General, in the name of the said Director, took exception to the decision mentioned and announced his intention to file the proper bill of exceptions, which, on being filed, was forwarded to the clerk of this court with the appeal submitted.<br\/><br\/>It is a mere question of law that is raised in this case, through the appeal filed by the Attorney-General, in representation of the Director of Lands, against two decisions of the Court of Land Registration, and is, whether or not new notifications and publications are necessary in cases where, after they once have been made and the registration of the realty has been decreed, the applicant requests an amendment of the description of the land and of its plan, with an increase in area and the statement of the name of a new adjacent property owner not mentioned in the previous notifications and publications, or substituting the same by other names.<br\/><br\/>The judge of the Court of Land Registration decided that in the present case it was not necessary to issue new notifications and to republish, and, for the reasons set forth in his order of August 28, 1909, aforementioned, decreed that the amendment solicited was proper, without new advertisement or notices.<br\/><br\/>From the whole of the provisions contained in Act No. 496, it appears that the procedure required in the case of an application for registration is that denominated in law in rem, that is, one against all persons who may allege any right to the property that is the subject of the application for registration, and the decree of the court granting it constitutes a valid and effective title, not only against all the owners of the adjacent properties who appeared at the trial, but also against all the parties who may have an interest in the land.<br\/><br\/>In order that the registrations decreed by the Court of Land Registration and the titles in consequence thereof issued might be vested with greater guarantee of security, the said Act No. 496 provided for an assurance fund wherewith to pay the claims filed against the property registered in accordance with the provisions thereof, and prescribed the due procedure to be followed and observed on the basis of publication. For this reason, it is provided that the applicant shall attach to his application for the registration of the land a plan and a description thereof; that all the owners of the adjacent properties and all other persons who may have any interest in the said land shall be notified, and that the notifications shall be published in the Official Gazette and in the newspapers, together with a description of the property to which the application refers, which description, with the plan, must be the basis of the record, and the decree, in case the applicant's petition is granted, must contain an exact and detailed description of the land, in accordance with the final decision of the court.<br\/><br\/>If amendments or alterations were permitted in the description of land sought to be registered, after the publication of the application in the newspapers and the issuance of the decree for the registration of the property, on the petition of the interested party, without new notifications and advertisement whereby to make known to all persons the said alterations and amendments concerning the situation, boundaries, and area of the land, the mandate of the law would be violated relative to the publicity of the proceedings prescribed for the registration of real estate, a publicity which permeates the whole system of special trial established for the registration of landed properties. Moreover, third parties who have not had an opportunity to present their claims, might be seriously affected in their rights by not being notified, it being natural and just that they be not injured in consequence of the rectification that is sought.<br\/><br\/>The alteration or amendment of the plan of the land in question and of its description may affect other persons besides the adjacent property owners Protasio Cabrera and the heirs of Gregorio Pineda: wherefore the agreement of these owners or of their representatives is not sufficient in order to comply with the Land Registration Act, for there might be other persons who have a right in rem in the properties of the said adjacent owners who would be injured by the diminution of the area of the property encumbered by such a right in rem. This possible injury to them should be avoided by means of new notifications and publications concerning the rectification or amendment desired. Moreover, a third party, who did not appear to allege his right in consequence of the previous publication of the description of the land, in accordance with the original plan, in the belief that the property concerned is one in which he had no interest whatever, would afterwards find that the said land, by a subsequent decree of the court, has a different situation and different boundaries which affect his right, of which differences he was not duly informed, on account of the omission of the indispensable notification and publication ordered by law.<br\/><br\/>This omission might give rise to the possibility of claims being filed against the Government for losses and damages on the grounds that the claimant, without negligence on his part and through the lack of notification and publication of the rectification and amendment of the boundaries and situation of the land, was unable to appear at the trial and was prevented from defending his rights and presenting the proper claim. Such a case should be guarded against as should also a decree of registration of a parcel or tract of land which does not conform exactly to the parcel which is the subject of the proceedings or that the description of the same should not coincide with that set forth in the decree ordering the registration.<br\/><br\/>For the reasons above expressed, it is proper, in our opinion, that, with a reversal of the decree of February 15, providing for the registration of the said land, and the decree of August 28, 1909, the case be returned to the Court of Land Registration, in order that, by due notifications and new publications of the amendment or rectification of the description of the land, as expressed in the applicant's petition, the judge may proceed in accordance with law and render in due course of time such decree as justice demands.

Southworth, assistant prosecuting attorney of the city of Manila, in the first of which the said prosecuting\u00a0 attorney swears to said information, and\u00a0 in the second of which the said official swore that he had practiced the preliminary investigation in the office of the prosecuting attorney of the city of Manila prescribed by section 39 of Act No. 183 of the honorable Philippine Commission, being the charter of the city of Manila, as amended by section 2 of Act No. 612 of said Commission.\u00a0 Said affidavits were\u00a0 signed and\u00a0 sworn\u00a0 to before the judge presiding over the criminal branch of this court.\u00a0\u00a0 A warrant\u00a0 was thereupon issued for the arrest of the defendants who,\u00a0 in pursuance of said warrant, were brought into the court on the same day, the said information was\u00a0 read to them and they were\u00a0 allowed\u00a0 until\u00a0 the morning of the 7th day of November to plead thereto.\u00a0 At the conclusion of the reading of said complaint the defendants, with the assistance\u00a0 of their counsel, all presented a bail bond in the sum of Pl,000 each, and were then released from custody, being ordered to\u00a0 return to court the morning of the\u00a0 said 7th day of November.\u00a0 At the\u00a0 time last before mentioned the defendants with their counsel all appeared in court and presented in writing a motion to quash the proceedings herein, which motion is based upon two propositions:\u00a0 (1) That the preliminary investigation required by law has not been practiced in this court; (2) that no specific order has been issued by the court in which it\u00a0 has been determined that the crime complained of has been committed and that there is reasonable ground\u00a0 to\u00a0 believe that the parties charged have committed such crime.<br\/><br\/>\"1.\u00a0 The charge in this case is a violation of the provisions of chapter 297 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 Compiled Laws of the Philippine Commission.\u00a0 The punishment prescribed\u00a0 for\u00a0 such violation is 'a fine of not exceeding four thousand pesos, or imprisonment not exceeding one\u00a0 year, or both, so that the case is\u00a0 only triable in this\u00a0 court.\u00a0\u00a0 Section 13\u00a0 of General Orders, No. 58 (being section 3261 of the Compiled Laws), provides that - <br\/><br\/>\" 'When a complaint or information alleging the commission of a crime is laid before a magistrate, he must examine, on\u00a0 oath,\u00a0 the\u00a0 informant or prosecutor and the\u00a0 witnesses produced, and take\u00a0 their\u00a0 depositions\u00a0 in writing,\u00a0 causing them\u00a0 to be subscribed by the parties making them.\u00a0 If the magistrate be\u00a0 satisfied from the investigation that the crime complained of has been committed, and that\u00a0 there is reasonable ground to believe that the party charged has committed it, he must issue an order for his arrest.\u00a0 If the offense be bailable, and\u00a0 the defendant\u00a0 offer a sufficient security, he shatl\u00a0 be admitted to bail; otherwise he shall be committed to prison.'<br\/><br\/>\"This\u00a0 was\u00a0 the law\u00a0 promulgated\u00a0 during the\u00a0 military government of the Philippine Islands under American sover-eignty,\u00a0 and after the establishment of the civil\u00a0 government\u00a0 here and the volume of business in\u00a0 this court was found to be substantially larger than was anticipated, the law hereinbefore mentioned was\u00a0 enacted by the honorable Philippine Commission to furnish relief to this court in the city of\u00a0 Manila.\u00a0 Thereupon\u00a0 such relief was\u00a0 provided by means of Act No. 612 of said Commission, the second section of which, so far as the same is applicable to this case, is as fallows:<br\/><br\/>\" 'In cases triable in\u00a0 the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, the defendant shall have a speedy trial, but shall not be entitled as of right to a preliminary examination in any case where the prosecuting attorney, after a due investigation of the facts,\u00a0 under\u00a0 section thirty-nine of the Act of which this is an amendment, shall have presented an information against him in proper form: Provided, however, That\u00a0 the Court of First Instance may make such summary investigation\u00a0 into the\u00a0 case as it\u00a0 may\u00a0 deem necessary to enable it to fix the bail or to determine whether the offense is bailable.'<br\/><br\/>\"The validity of this law and the sufficiency of the provisions thereof in the matter of criminal procedure treated therein were submitted to and considered by the honorable Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands\u00a0 in\u00a0 a very able decision of\u00a0 that court in the case entitled\u00a0 'United States, complainant, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>.

A specific separate order of the\u00a0 court as to probable cause, etc., is no longer required by law in\u00a0 criminal causes (felonies) instituted in this court (city of Manila).\u00a0 The practice prescribed in said section of\u00a0 General\u00a0 Orders, No. 68, was only required in cases in which the\u00a0 preliminary investigations therein were conducted by the trial judge or magistrate; in\u00a0 fact, said section\u00a0 of\u00a0 General\u00a0 Orders, No. 58, does not provide that a written order to this end must be made by such magistrate.\u00a0 However, as to\u00a0 the city\u00a0 of Manila, said practice has been entirely substituted by section 2 of said Act No. 612, the prosecuting attorney of the city of Manila, according* to the provisions of section 486 of the Compiled Laws (sec. 39, Act No. 183 of the Commission), is a\u00a0 judicial officer, having full\u00a0 authority\u00a0 to\u00a0 make\u00a0 preliminary investigations and\u00a0 present informations in all criminal cases, and when he\u00a0 as\u00a0 such officer\u00a0 presents\u00a0 in court an information sworn to by him accompanied by an affidavit that he has practiced the preliminary investigation required by law,\u00a0 in pursuance of\u00a0 said Act No. 612, and takes such\u00a0 oaths before the magistrate, who is the judge presiding1 over this (criminal)\u00a0 branch of the court, probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, appears of record in the case.\u00a0 In reality at the time of\u00a0 the presentation\u00a0 of said information,\u00a0 together with said\u00a0 affidavits, the\u00a0 trial judge (magistrate) considered and determined that probable cause, etc.,\u00a0 had been shown.\u00a0\u00a0 The issuance of the warrant signed by the same magistrate or trial\u00a0 judge must\u00a0 be\u00a0 considered as\u00a0 a\u00a0 determination on the part\u00a0 of the court or magistrate as to probable cause, etc., if such a determination is now necessary\u00a0 under\u00a0 the\u00a0 amended\u00a0 laws applicable\u00a0 to this\u00a0 feature of the case.\u00a0 Through the assistance of defendants' counsel\u00a0 a bail bond\u00a0 was provided by them\u00a0 and approved by the court\u00a0 at the\u00a0 time\u00a0 of\u00a0 the reading of the complaint and one\u00a0 and one-half days before the presentation of the motion.\u00a0\u00a0 Under the rule laid down in text-books and in the American\u00a0 and English Encyclopedia of Law, the questions raised in said\u00a0 motion\u00a0 are unseasonable.<br\/><br\/>\"In the said Wilson case, the honorable Supreme Court considered this very question, and there not appearing in the record a specific order of the trial judge (magistrate) as to probable cause, the Supreme Court held that the same is not now an indispensable legal step in\u00a0 a\u00a0 criminal cause instituted in this court\u00a0 (city of Manila).<br\/><br\/>\"During the last two years it\u00a0 has\u00a0 been impossible to conduct preliminary investigations before the judge (magistrate)\u00a0 presiding over criminal sala,\u00a0 and\u00a0 it has not\u00a0 been considered necessary in view of the doctrine promulgated by the honorable Supreme Court of the Philippine\u00a0 Islands in the said\u00a0 Wilson case.\u00a0 The rule of procedure approved and settled in the said last-mentioned case has been followed by all the judges\u00a0 presiding over this branch of the court, and very properly so in view of the great magnitude of business pressed upon the court for its attention.<br\/><br\/>\"Following and being governed by the interpretation of the law as found in the said decision of the honorable Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands, this court must and does overrule the said motion as to the said second proposition.<br\/><br\/>\"It is\u00a0 therefore ordered that\u00a0 said motion be denied and that the\u00a0 defendants each and all plead to said information forthwith.\"<\/blockquote>The defendants\u00a0 duly\u00a0 excepted to this order denying said motion.<br\/><br\/>On the 10th of November, 1908, the defendants presented another motion as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Come\u00a0 now Martin Ocampo, Teodoro M.

It was the duty of the\u00a0 prosecuting at torney under\u00a0 Act No.\u00a0 183,\u00a0 to which Act\u00a0 No. 612 is an amendment, to investigate all crimes and misdemeanors occurring in the\u00a0 city of Manila, and to prepare and present complaints and informations\u00a0 to the proper courts, but to these investigations there is not given such solemnity under Act No.\u00a0 183 as to render subsequent investigations by the court before issuing warrants of arrest unnecessary.<br\/><br\/>\"The lawmaking body in passing Act No.\u00a0 612 evidently had a twofold purpose in view, namely:<br\/><br\/>\"(1)\u00a0 To prevent the publicity which was necessarily incident to\u00a0 such investigations before the\u00a0 judge\u00a0 in\u00a0 open court.<br\/><br\/>\"(2)\u00a0 To expedite\u00a0 the criminal business in the\u00a0 Court of First Instance\u00a0 in the city of Manila\u00a0 (with\u00a0 dockets\u00a0 usually crowded) by having\u00a0 these preliminary examinations held by the prosecuting attorney.<br\/><br\/>\"The Supreme Court of the\u00a0 Philippine Islands has expressly decided that it\u00a0 is not necessary for the judges of the Court of First Instance\u00a0 of the city of\u00a0 Manila to hold preliminary investigations, when an information is presented by the prosecuting attorney, certifying that a preliminary investigation has been held by him.\u00a0 (See U.

It would be impossible for the judge to issue an order saying that he found probable cause to exist unless he personally conducted\u00a0 the\u00a0 preliminary examination.\u00a0\u00a0 He\u00a0 would have nothing upon which to base the order.\u00a0 It might be said that the judge could issue the order upon the faith of the preliminary examination held by the prosecuting\u00a0 attorney, as certified to in the information.\u00a0 If\u00a0 this be true, if the judge has the right to accept the preliminary\u00a0 examination made by the prosecuting attorney, and\u00a0 from it, as certified in the information, find that probable cause exists, then the court has found that probable cause exists in\u00a0 this case by the issuance of the warrants of arrest.\u00a0 But conceding that it was absolutely\u00a0 necessary for\u00a0 the\u00a0 court to\u00a0 hold\u00a0 a preliminary examination; that it was absolutely necessary for the court to find that probable cause existed before issuing the warrants of arrest, these matters could only render the arrest illegal, and it is perfectly\u00a0 immaterial as to whether the arrest is legal or illegal.\u00a0 The defendants are before the court, and\u00a0 the court has the legal right to try them upon\u00a0 a valid information.\u00a0 The courts have held\u00a0 that if a party is arrested\u00a0 without warrant and brought before a\u00a0 court of competent\u00a0 jurisdiction,\u00a0 that the\u00a0 court\u00a0 will proceed to\u00a0 try the accused\u00a0 notwithstanding the illegality of the arrest.

The legislative department of the Government, therefore, must have had in mind, when it denied to defendants the right of a preliminary examination in\u00a0 the city of Manila, the provisions of the Philippine Bill.<br\/><br\/>By reference to the proceedings in the court below\u00a0 preceding\u00a0 the\u00a0 arrest of the defendant (all\u00a0 of\u00a0 which\u00a0 is\u00a0 set out above)\u00bb\u00a0 it will be seen that the\u00a0 procedure adopted\u00a0 by\u00a0 Act No.\u00a0 183 (Charter of the city of Manila), as\u00a0 amended by said Act No.\u00a0 612, was followed; therefore the question\u00a0 is presented: Does\u00a0 such procedure\u00a0 constitute due process of law?\u00a0 This\u00a0 phrase has been discussed a great many times by the Supreme Court of the United States, by the supreme courts of the different States, and by all of the writers upon questions of constitutional law.\u00a0 The\u00a0 requirement\u00a0 above quoted from the\u00a0 Philippine Bill\u00a0 relating to due process of law\u00a0 is found\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 constitution of practically all\u00a0 of\u00a0 the States of the\u00a0 Union.\u00a0 It is sometimes couched in the\u00a0 language that\u00a0 persons \"shall\u00a0 not be\u00a0 deprived of their life, liberty, or property\"\u00a0 except by \"the law of the land.\"\u00a0 In others, the phrase is \"due process of law.\"\u00a0\u00a0 These different phrases, however,\u00a0 have been\u00a0 given\u00a0 practically\u00a0 the same definition by the\u00a0 different courts\u00a0 which have attempted an explanation\u00a0 of their meaning.\u00a0\u00a0 The phrase \"due process of law\" has been variously defined.\u00a0 Judge Story, in his work on Constitutional Law, defines it\u00a0 as \"The law in its regular course of administration, through the courts of justice.\"<br\/><br\/>Judge Cooley, in his\u00a0 work on Constitutional Limitations, says\u00a0 (p. 434) :<br\/><blockquote>\"Due process of law\u00a0 in each particular case means such an exercise of the powers of the government\u00a0 as the settled maxims of\u00a0 law\u00a0 permit\u00a0 and sanction, and under such safeguards for the protection of individual\u00a0 rights\u00a0 as those maxims prescribe for the\u00a0 class of cases to which the\u00a0 one in question\u00a0 belongs\"<br\/><br\/>But even though\u00a0 it be\u00a0 contended that a preliminary examination is a\u00a0 necessary step in \"due process of law,\"<br\/><\/blockquote>then\u00a0 we reply that a preliminary examination was held in the present case by the prosecuting attorney\u00a0 of the city of Manila, as\u00a0 will appear from his sworn\u00a0 statement.\u00a0 Certainly it will not be contended that he is not as competent to conduct a preliminary\u00a0 examination\u00a0 as\u00a0 the average person designated\u00a0 by the\u00a0 law\u00a0 for that\u00a0 purpose.\u00a0 He is a sworn officer of the court and the law makes it his\u00a0 duty to make these investigations.\u00a0 The legislature may designate whomsoever it pleases, within the judicial department, for that purpose.\u00a0\u00a0 The prosecuting\u00a0 attorney\u00a0 is a sworn\u00a0 official of the\u00a0 Government and is\u00a0 just\u00a0 as likely to be free from prejudice\u00a0 as any other\u00a0 official\u00a0 who\u00a0 might be\u00a0 appointed or designated.<br\/><br\/>It may be argued also that Act No. 612 is\u00a0 a special\u00a0 law applicable to the city of Manila alone and is for that reason unconstitutional.\u00a0\u00a0 In reply to\u00a0 that\u00a0 argument it may\u00a0 be said:<br\/><br\/>(<i>a<\/i>) That there is no requirement that all the\u00a0 laws in the Philippine Islands shall be alike\u00a0 applicable throughout the Islands;<br\/><br\/>(<i>b<\/i>) That the city of Manila\u00a0 is governed\u00a0 by a\u00a0 special charter and has such powers as are expressly or impliedly given to\u00a0 it\u00a0 without reference to the powers\u00a0 given\u00a0 to\u00a0 the other municipalities;<br\/><br\/>(<i>c<\/i>)\u00a0 That it has\u00a0 special\u00a0 courts with\u00a0 special jurisdiction which other municipalities do not have;<br\/><br\/>(<i>d<\/i>) It has its own method of levying and collecting taxes, which is different from\u00a0 the method of other municipalities;<br\/><br\/>(<i>e<\/i>)\u00a0 It has its own officials with special functions, some of which other municipalities do not have;<br\/><br\/>(<i>f<\/i>)\u00a0 It has many\u00a0 special powers, such as to make and enter into certain\u00a0 classes of special contracts, which other municipalities do not have.<br\/><br\/>It would be just as logical\u00a0 to hold that all of the other special provisions\u00a0 for the city of\u00a0 Manila are unconstitutional, as to\u00a0 hold\u00a0 that the\u00a0 one in\u00a0 question is contrary to the Philippine Bill, simply because they are not applicable throughout the Philippine\u00a0 Islands.\u00a0 To\u00a0 hold\u00a0 thus would mean that the legislature\u00a0 could\u00a0 hot grant to particular municipalities any special rights or impose upon them any special obligations which\u00a0 were not\u00a0 applicable\u00a0 to all\u00a0 the municipalities.<br\/><blockquote>\"Due process of law\" is not ironclad in its meaning.\u00a0 It does not necessarily mean a particular procedure.\u00a0 The National Government may adopt one procedure satisfying the requirement and the State government may adopt still another,\u00a0 and not only that, but each State may adopt an entirely different procedure from that adopted either by the National Government or by any\u00a0 of the sister States, provided always that the procedure\u00a0 adopted in each jurisdiction fully furnishes protection to life, liberty, and property.

Worcester, was guilty of the said acts, deeds,\u00a0 and doings; all of which allegations regarding the conduct and character of the said Dean C.\u00a0 Worcester, as above set\u00a0 forth, were charged to be false and without foundation in fact.<br\/><br\/>In our opinion these charges, if false, are clearly libelous; therefore the lower court committed no error in overruling said demurrer.\u00a0\u00a0 We\u00a0 think\u00a0 that\u00a0 the information contains sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action for libel.<br\/><br\/>The theory of the\u00a0 defense\u00a0 is that the alleged libelous editorial does not apply to the\u00a0 said\u00a0 Dean\u00a0 C.\u00a0 Worcester. That is a\u00a0 question of proof.\u00a0\u00a0 It is charged that they do. If they do, then they tend to impeach the honesty, virtue, and reputation of Mr. Worcester and to expose him to public hatred, contempt, and ridicule and are, therefore, libelous;<br\/><br\/>Under the fifth assignment of error above\u00a0 noted, the defendants and appellants contend that the court committed an error in permitting witnesses to give their opinion upon the question whether or not the words in\u00a0 the said editorial apply to Mr. Dean C.

With regard to a publication in which a libel is printed, not only is the publisher but also all other persons who in\u00a0 any way\u00a0 participate in or have any connection with its publication are\u00a0 liable as publishers.\"<\/blockquote>This\u00a0 decision\u00a0 would seem to be conclusive against\u00a0 the contention\u00a0 of the appellant.\u00a0 However, an\u00a0 examination of the jurisprudence\u00a0 of other jurisdictions shows clearly that the same doctrine has been established elsewhere.

St. Rep., 629), the question\u00a0 of the responsibility of the manager or proprietor of a newspaper was discussed.\u00a0\u00a0 The court said, among other things (pp. 782, 783):<br\/><blockquote>\"The question then recurs as to whether the manager or proprietor of a newspaper can escape criminal responsibility solely on the ground that the libelous article was published without his knowledge\u00a0 or consent.\u00a0\u00a0 When a libel is published in a newspaper, such fact alone is sufficient evidence prima facie to charge the manager or proprietor with the guilt of its publication.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>\"The manager\u00a0 and proprietor of\u00a0 a newspaper, we think ought to be held prima facie liable criminally for whatever appears in his paper; and it should be no defense that the publication was made\u00a0 without his\u00a0 knowledge or consent, *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>\"One who furnishes the means for carrying on the publication of a newspaper and entrusts its management to servants or employees whom he selects and controls may be said to cause to\u00a0 be published what actually appears, and should be held responsible therefor, whether he was individually concerned in the publication\u00a0 or not,\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 * Criminal responsibility for the acts of an\u00a0 agent or servant in the course of\u00a0 his employment necessarily implies some degree of guilt or delinquency on the part\u00a0 of the publisher; * * *<br\/><br\/>\"We think,\u00a0 therefore, the mere\u00a0 fact\u00a0 that the\u00a0 libelous article was published in the newspaper without the knowledge or consent of its proprietor or manager is no defense to\u00a0 a criminal prosecution\u00a0 against such\u00a0 proprietor\u00a0 or manager.\"<\/blockquote>In the case of Commonwealth <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>. Morgan (107 Mass., 197), this same question was\u00a0 considered and the court held that in the criminal prosecution of\u00a0 a publisher of a newspaper in which a libel appears, he is prima facie presumed to have published the libel, and that the exclusion of an offer by the defendant to prove that he never saw the libel and was not aware of its publication until it\u00a0 was pointed out to him and that an apology and retraction were afterwards\u00a0 published in the same paper, gave him no ground for exception. In this same case, Mr. Justice Colt, speaking for the court, said:<br\/><blockquote>\"It is the duty of the proprietor of a public paper, which may be used for the publication of improper communications, to use reasonable caution in the conduct of his business that no libels be\u00a0 published.\"\u00a0 (Wharton's\u00a0 Criminal Law, sees. 1627, 1649; 1 Bishop's\u00a0 Criminal\u00a0 Law, sees. 219,\u00a0 221; People\u00a0 <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>.\u00a0 Wilson, 64 111., 195; Commonwealth <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>.

The court erred in holding that the defendant published and caused to be\u00a0 published the editorial referred to in the complaint, and in convicting him of said crime.\" The lower\u00a0 court\u00a0 in rendering its decision\u00a0 against this defendant (Reyes) said:<br\/><br\/>\"This\u00a0 defendant (Fidel A.\u00a0 Reyes) is the chief editor of the newspaper 'El Renacimiento' as the word editor\u00a0 is used in section 6 of Act No. 277 above referred to, and as such editor is chargeable with the\u00a0 publication of the article set forth in\u00a0 the complaint.\"<\/blockquote>The Solicitor-General, after discussing the\u00a0 evidence pro and con\u00a0 relating to the\u00a0 defendant Reyes,\u00a0 refused to make any recommendation concerning him.<br\/><br\/>The evidence shows that Fidel A. Reyes was the redactor jefe of\u00a0 \"El Renacimiento\"\u00a0 at the time of the publication of the said alleged libelous editorial.\u00a0\u00a0 Many witnesses were called for the purpose of showing the duties of the redactor jefe.\u00a0 The conclusions of the Solicitor-General relating to the said duties are found in the following quotation:<br\/><blockquote>\"The\u00a0 duties\u00a0 of the redactor jefe\u00a0 are in general to centralize and examine rough\u00a0 copy which comes\u00a0 in, requests for publication, etc., and to properly edit it, and this work he afterwards\u00a0 submits to\u00a0 the directors, without whose approval it can not be published.\"<\/blockquote>W. B. Watson was called as a witness on rebuttal\u00a0 by the Government, and\u00a0 testified\u00a0 that the position\u00a0 of\u00a0 redactor jefe corresponded generally\u00a0 to that of city\u00a0 editor on\u00a0 American papers, who oversee news matter, edit the reporter's copy, and can write editorials,\u00a0 which,\u00a0 if approved, are published.<br\/><br\/>Macario Adriatico was called\u00a0 as\u00a0 a witness,\u00a0 and after stating the experience which he had had as director of newspapers in the Philippine Islands, testified that the\u00a0 position of redactor jefe was subordinate\u00a0 to the director, and that the\u00a0 publication of\u00a0 editorials\u00a0 was\u00a0 exclusively under\u00a0 the control of the director.\u00a0 It appears from the evidence, under the system of editing publications\u00a0 in the Philippine Islands, that the redactor jefe has no\u00a0 control whatsoever of\u00a0 the publishing1 of newspapers.\u00a0 Neither\u00a0 was it proven in\u00a0 the present case that he was the author or proprietor of the said newspaper.\u00a0\u00a0 We find no sufficient evidence in the record to justify the conviction of the defendant, Fidel A. Reyes.<br\/><br\/>After a careful consideration of\u00a0 the record brought to this court, of the evidence adduced pro and con during the trial\u00a0 of the cause,\u00a0 and a full consideration of the\u00a0 law applicable to such facts, we have arrived at the following conclusions:<br\/><br\/>First. That the sentence of the lower court with reference to the defendant Martin Ocampo\u00a0 should\u00a0 be and is hereby affirmed, and he is hereby sentenced to be imprisoned for a period of six months and\u00a0 to pay\u00a0 a fine of\u00a0 P2,000, to\u00a0 pay one-fifth part of the costs\u00a0 of the action in the lower court and one-third part of the costs in this court, and in case of insolvency to suffer subsidiary imprisonment in accordance with the provisions of Act No. 1732.<br\/><br\/>Second. That the\u00a0 sentence\u00a0 of the\u00a0 lower court imposed upon the defendant Teodoro M.\u00a0 Kalaw, in view of the high character of the person libeled and the dignity of the office which\u00a0 he held at the time the libel\u00a0 was published,\u00a0 and in view of the fact that the defendant attempted to prove\u00a0 the truth of the\u00a0 alleged\u00a0 libelous publication and his failure so to do,\u00a0 thereby practically\u00a0 repeating and\u00a0 republishing\u00a0 the libel; and in\u00a0 view\u00a0 of the recommendation of the Attorney- General, we\u00a0 are of\u00a0 the opinion that the sentence\u00a0 of\u00a0 the lower\u00a0 court\u00a0 should\u00a0 be\u00a0 modified,\u00a0 and that\u00a0 the defendant Teodoro M. Kalaw should be sentenced to be imprisoned\u00a0 for a period of twelve months, to pay a fine of P3,000, one-fifth part of the costs of the action in the lower court and one- third part of the costs\u00a0 in this court, and\u00a0 in\u00a0 case\u00a0 of insolvency to suffer subsidiary imprisonment in accordance with the provisions of Act No. 1732.<br\/><br\/>Third. That the sentence of the lower court imposed upon the defendant Fidel A. Reyes, because of the insufficiency of the proof adduced during the trial of the cause, should be reversed and the complaint as to him should be dismissed, with costs de oficio.\u00a0 It is so ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Registration for the registration of\u00a0 two parcels of land situated in Antipolo, Province of\u00a0 Rizal,\u00a0 and her application received favorable action, as the adjudication and registration\u00a0 of the property was decreed on May 15,\u00a0 1908.<br\/><br\/>But subsequently, on July 13 of the same year, Mariano Limjap petitioned for a revision of\u00a0 the proceedings had in connection with one of the said parcels and a new hearing was granted.<br\/><br\/>At\u00a0 this new hearing the applicant recognized the right of the opponent, Mariano Limjap, to the portion of land which was the subject of the opposition and the revision.<br\/><br\/>The land adjudicated to Maria Salud Flores, concerned in Limjap's opposition, is that situated in Samboanga, municipality of Antipolo, Province of\u00a0 Rizal, with\u00a0 an area\u00a0 of 20,081.96 square meters, the boundaries of which are\u00a0 set forth\u00a0 in\u00a0 the application and are herein taken for granted, since\u00a0 the identity of the property, which is also admitted, was agreed upon.\u00a0 This land that is the subject of Limjap's opposition contains 437 square meters and 50 square decimeters and\u00a0 was acquired at a public\u00a0 auction held by the provincial treasurer of Rizal on July 22, 1904.<br\/><br\/>The Court of Land Registration, in\u00a0 view of the acquiescence of\u00a0 the applicant, Maria\u00a0 Salud\u00a0 Flores, decreed,\u00a0 on June\u00a0 30, 1908, the adjudication and registration of the parcel of land claimed\u00a0 by\u00a0 Mariano Limjap and his wife, Maria Escolar.\u00a0 Some time afterwards, Limjap conveyed his\u00a0 right in the said piece of land to Cayetano Arguelles.<br\/><br\/>The plan of the said Samboanga land having been\u00a0 drawn by\u00a0 the Bureau\u00a0 of\u00a0 Lands, the applicant\u00a0 signified her\u00a0 acceptance.<br\/><br\/>The facts\u00a0 thus far,\u00a0 which give rise to no discussion whatever and\u00a0 are\u00a0 stated as\u00a0 antecedents\u00a0 of\u00a0 those\u00a0 which constitute the subject matter of the present appeal, are:<br\/><ol><li>The applicant, in\u00a0 order\u00a0 to distinguish and separate the parcel of\u00a0 land corresponding to\u00a0 Limjap, presented a plan,\u00a0 in\u00a0 agreement with that\u00a0 drawn by the\u00a0 Bureau\u00a0 of Lands and signed only by herself, in which the\u00a0 said parcel is demarcated, with an area of 437.50 square meters, and the remainder, pertaining to the applicant, 18,706.50 square meters.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>On August 28, 1909, the Court of Land Registration issued the following order:<br\/><blockquote>\"Whereas, in the plan subscribed by the applicant, Maria Salud\u00a0 Flores, on the 26th of May last,\u00a0 and which is an exact copy of that drawn by the Bureau of Lands, specification is made of the portion of land adjudicated to Mariano Limjap y Nolasco,\u00a0 by a transaction entered into between the latter and the said applicant, which\u00a0 portion has been conveyed to Mr. Cayetano Arguelles y Fernandez\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 * let\u00a0 a decree be entered in favor of\u00a0 the aforementioned Arguelles for the said\u00a0 portion of land referred to\u00a0 in the technical description subscribed by the\u00a0 applicant,\u00a0 Maria Salud Flores, and by Mariano Limjap.\"<\/blockquote><\/li><li>A surveyor of the Court of Land Registration represented to the latter that the said plan was signed by a person\u00a0 not authorized by the provisions\u00a0 of Act No. 1937 to sign plans, and that it should be returned to the applicant with the requirement that\u00a0 she present a new plan duly approved by the Bureau of Lands.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>The clerk of the Court of Land Registration also called the attention of the applicant to the incorrectness\u00a0 of the statement of the area of each one\u00a0 of the two parcels of land, and suggested to her the necessity of filing an amended application, without\u00a0 which the decree of registration could not be issued.\u00a0 Both the applicant and Cayetano Arguelles filed the new application, rectifying the area of each parcel of land in the following manner: That of Arguelles's land was given as\u00a0 435.^3 square meters, instead of 487.50 square meters;\u00a0 and\u00a0 that of Maria\u00a0 Salud\u00a0 Flores's, as\u00a0 18,708.47 square meters, instead of 18,706.50 square meters.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>On February 26, 1910, the Court of Land Registration, in harmony\u00a0 with the\u00a0 representation made by\u00a0 one\u00a0 of\u00a0 its surveyors, and contained in fact No. 3 above, made a ruling wherein it ordered that the plan referred to be admitted.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>On March\u00a0 17,\u00a0 1910, the Attorney-General protested against and toolran exception to the said ruling, and prayed for its reconsideration on the ground that it was contrary to the provisions of Acts Nos.\u00a0 1875 and 1937, and announced, moreover, that, in case his\u00a0 motion to reconsider was denied, he likewise would take exception thereto.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>The Court of Land Registration, on March 22, 1910, ruled upon the said\u00a0 motion for\u00a0 reconsideration, denying the same and admitting the exceptions taken to both rulings. In this manner the question was submitted on appeal.<\/li><\/ol>Is it necessary that a plan, exactly copied from one drawn by the Bureau of Lands, in which a\u00a0 parcel of land is demarcated which must be segregated therefrom as belonging to an opponent or some other person\u00a0 not the applicant, be signed by a surveyor authorized to exercise his profession, and that it be again approved by the said\u00a0 Bureau?<br\/><br\/>Arguments for\u00a0 the contrary opinion are: (1) That, in the case of# Maria Guia Garcia, No. 5399, it\u00a0 was decided that,\u00a0 when the\u00a0 original plan has been\u00a0 approved\u00a0 by the Bureau of\u00a0 Lands, as in the case under examination, it is not necessary to require that the plan of the segregated portion be\u00a0 again approved by the Bureau\u00a0 aforementioned, inasmuch as the surveyors of the Court of Land Registration\u00a0 likewise have the technical and\u00a0 other knowledge required of those of that Bureau and the necessary ability to fudge whether the segregation made of a piece of land on a plan already approved by the Bureau\u00a0 of Lands is or is not correct;\u00a0 (2) that,\u00a0 even when the plans have been approved by the Bureau of Lands, the surveyors of the Court of Land Registration\u00a0 are\u00a0 not exempt from the duty of examining\u00a0 them before they are\u00a0 published or before the titles are decreed; and (3) that the\u00a0 procedure of a new approval by the Bureau of Lands, in the cases of the segregation of any portion of\u00a0 a\u00a0 parcel or tract of land,\u00a0 the plan of which has already been examined and approved by the said Bureau, would only mean an unnecessary repetition of labor.<br\/><br\/>The following arguments support an affirmative decision of the preceding question: (1)\u00a0 That there is no comparison between the case of Maria\u00a0 Guia Garcia and the present one, since, in the former, the applicant sold a portion of her property after it had been registered, while, in the present case, the property\u00a0 has\u00a0 not yet been\u00a0 registered and\u00a0 the segregation of a part of the same was not\u00a0 effected by any act\u00a0 of the applicant, but through a decree of the Court of Land Registration issued as a result of a\u00a0 revision\u00a0 obtained by the\u00a0 real owner of the\u00a0 land\u00a0 before the decision became final;\u00a0 (2) that,\u00a0 were the said plan admitted,\u00a0 the adjudication would\u00a0 have to be made in accord with\u00a0 the measurements\u00a0 and other data given in the plan, relative to the segregated\u00a0 portion, although the area given\u00a0 in\u00a0 the said plan, both to the lesser\u00a0 and to the\u00a0 greater parcel, was found to be inexact and incorrect, and, moreover,\u00a0 the said plan is signed by the\u00a0 applicant herself, who\u00a0 is\u00a0 not even a private surveyor,\u00a0 and no value can be attached to the\u00a0 allegation\u00a0 that it\u00a0 is\u00a0 a copy of an original, approved plan, because this original does not\u00a0 contain\u00a0 the portion segregated in that copy;\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 that the boundaries of\u00a0 the segregated portion were established by\u00a0 an unauthorized person, and\u00a0 hence the inexactness\u00a0 in area; and, finally, that, it being the duty of the surveyors of the Court\u00a0 of Land Registration, as it\u00a0 is in\u00a0 fact, to examine the plans submitted to the court, it was a surveyor of the court who complied with\u00a0 his duty in examining the plan and it\u00a0 was he who proposed the rejection of the measurements therein established by\u00a0 one who\u00a0 was not a surveyor, pursuant\u00a0 to the conditions required in section 5 of Act No. 1937.<br\/><br\/>Since these provisions of the law must be observed, the order appealed from is reversed,\u00a0 and the\u00a0 Court of Land Registration\u00a0 shall\u00a0 require the\u00a0 filing of another plan prepared in conformity with the provisions of Act No. 1937.

that the contracts\u00a0 above\u00a0 mentioned were\u00a0 executed in\u00a0 consequence of and under the\u00a0 following circumstances: The defendant, while a\u00a0 young\u00a0 laborer\u00a0 without\u00a0 experience or\u00a0 technical knowledge, a native and resident\u00a0 of\u00a0 Switzerland, was, by recommendation and at the expense\u00a0 of the plaintiff,\u00a0 employed as an apprentice in an important hat manufactory in Switzerland, under the agreement\u00a0 that,\u00a0 after he should have acquired some experience,\u00a0 he should come to Manila at the expense of the plaintiff, to\u00a0 work in the latter's hat manufactory, as in fact he did, after an apprenticeship of one year and a half in the aforesaid manufactory in Switzerland.\u00a0 That on February\u00a0 11, 1900, the defendant arrived at this port, at the expense\u00a0 of the plaintiff, on which date a contract\u00a0 of lease of services was executed between both parties\u00a0 which contained nearly the same\u00a0 clauses as that mentioned in the complaint,\u00a0 which latter contract was executed after the expiration of the term of that first contract; that in the manufacture of hats in his manufactory in Manila, the plaintiff uses various recipes, formulas, and procedure,\u00a0 the acquisition and knowledge of which have cost him more than\u00a0 P20,000; that the defendant, during his stay in\u00a0 plaintiff's manufactories\u00a0 in Manila finally became familiar with the said procedure, formulas, and\u00a0 recipes employed by the plaintiff; that since the month of November, 1907, and after having left the service of the plaintiff, the\u00a0 said defendant engaged and\u00a0 continues\u00a0 to engage in the\u00a0 manufacture of straw hats in the city of Manila, against the\u00a0 will of the plaintiff, thereby violating, to the\u00a0 serious detriment of\u00a0 the latter, the stipulations of the aforementioned contracts of January\u00a0 11, 1902, and June 30,\u00a0 1904, and that he is therefore obliged to pay the plaintiff the sum of P10,000.<br\/><br\/>On the basis of the foregoing facts, the plaintiff requests: (1)\u00a0 that judgment be entered against the defendant and in favor of the said plaintiff for the sum of P10,000 and the costs of\u00a0 the trial; and (2) that, in default of such payment, the\u00a0 defendant be prohibited from engaging\u00a0 in the manufacture\u00a0 of hats in the Philippine Islands.<br\/><br\/>The defendant filed a demurrer to the complaint\u00a0 on the ground that it did not set forth facts sufficient to constitute a cause\u00a0 for action, which, demurrer was admitted by the court and the plaintiff was allowed a term of five days to amend the complaint, should he deem proper to do so.\u00a0 The plaintiff stated that\u00a0 he did\u00a0 not\u00a0 desire\u00a0 to amend it and requested that the case be decided\u00a0 on its merits, whereupon the court issued\u00a0 an order of dismissal, to which exception was\u00a0 taken in due form by the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>The question of law here raised is\u00a0 whether the stipulation\u00a0 contained in the\u00a0 third clause of\u00a0 the contract alleged in the complaint\u00a0 is or is not valid in law.\u00a0 The trial court has decided it in the negative, basing its decision on article 1583 of the Civil Code, which declares the hire of services for life to be\u00a0 null and void, concluding that, by virtue of the said stipulation, the services of the defendant, in so far as they concern the conduct of any business or undertaking in which the defendant might engage, were pledged for life to the plaintiff, for in the said clause, it\u00a0 appears that the services are not confined to any specific business or undertaking\u00a0 the manufacture of straw hats to which the complaint refers being included therein, nor is there a\u00a0 limit to the time\u00a0 during which the\u00a0 defendant shall\u00a0 be obliged to render his services exclusively to the plaintiff in the business or undertaking in which the latter might engage.<br\/><br\/>It is\u00a0 unquestionable that\u00a0 were it\u00a0 a matter\u00a0 of the hire of services\u00a0 for life the contract would be null and void in accordance with the said provision of theCivil Code, which, moreover, is clear\u00a0 and specific.\u00a0 But, in\u00a0 our opinion, that is not the case.\u00a0 The third clause referred to contains no contract whatever for the hire of services of any kind for any period of time,\u00a0 either long or short, and still less during the whole of defendant's life; far from this, it\u00a0 refers distinctly to the cessation of the services stipulated, not indeed for life, but for only two years and a half, in the first and second clauses of the contract; so that the agreement therein contained rests on the necessary supposition of\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant's\u00a0 having left the service of the plaintiff.\u00a0 The hire of services covenanted between\u00a0 both\u00a0 parties was\u00a0 terminated at the expiration of that period of two\u00a0 years\u00a0 and a half agreed upon, so recognized and\u00a0 expressly declared in the instrument\u00a0 of\u00a0 June\u00a0 30,\u00a0 1904, and therefore there is no occasion to speak here of such a hiring.<br\/><br\/>Considering the question from another point of view, the court says in the order appealed from that by\u00a0 virtue of what\u00a0 was covenanted in\u00a0 the\u00a0 third clause of the contract, the defendant was bound not to engage, either as a member of a\u00a0 firm, as an employee, or on his\u00a0 own account, directly or indirectly,\u00a0 in carrying on\u00a0 any business in which the plaintiff Gsell might be engaged, and in case of failure to comply therewith he was bound to pay in cash\u00a0 to the said plaintiff the sum of P10,000,\u00a0 which stipulation, it may be said\u00a0 in\u00a0 addition, deprives the defendant\u00a0 of the liberty to use his abilities for his own benefit or that of any other person except the plaintiff; that it constitutes a restrictive obligation or a prohibition in absolute terms with respect to\u00a0 defendant's conducting one or various industries; it is also an infringement of the latter's liberty to remain in these Islands, because if he conducts the same\u00a0 industry or engages\u00a0 in the\u00a0 same\u00a0 business\u00a0 in\u00a0 which the\u00a0 plaintiff\u00a0 is engaged,\u00a0 he would\u00a0 find himself obliged to absent himself from the\u00a0 Islands in order not to pay the P10,000\u00a0 specified in the aforesaid third clause of the contract.<br\/><br\/>We believe that this opinion is not well founded, considering the terms of the clause referred to.\u00a0 It does not prohibit the defendant from conducting\u00a0 any industry or business, even the kind of businesses in which the plaintiff is engaged. The defendant has not\u00a0 bound himself to abstain from such kinds\u00a0 of businesses or\u00a0 industries as are\u00a0 mentioned in the order appealed from.\u00a0\u00a0 At least,\u00a0 no obligation whatever of that kind appears\u00a0 to have\u00a0 been assumed in the contract. On the contrary, the latter allows the presumption that the said defendant may engage in the same industries or businesses in which the plaintiff is engaged, and the sole obligation that\u00a0 he has contracted with regard to this feature is that he shall pay to the latter\u00a0 P10,000 in case he should engage in them.\u00a0 Consequently the question which arises is that as to whether a\u00a0 person can lawfully bind himself to pay a\u00a0 certain sum of money to another in case the former shall\u00a0 conduct a\u00a0 specified business or\u00a0 industry.\u00a0 And we certainly do not see why such an obligation should be considered null and void, supposing that it is a question of a lawful industry or business.\u00a0 Within the liberty to make contracts, sanctioned by our laws, everyone is free to execute the contracts he may consider suitable, provided they are not contrary to law, morality, and good customs, and, in our opinion, there is nothing\u00a0 in the obligation referred to that is\u00a0 opposed to any of these three conceptions.\u00a0 Apparently,\u00a0 the\u00a0 obligation essentially rests\u00a0 on a\u00a0 just desire on the part of the plaintiff to protect himself by means of an\u00a0 indemnity paid in advance\u00a0 against the\u00a0 effects of\u00a0 the competition which the defendant might make, after he had duly qualified the defendant to enable him to do so, by defraying the expenses of his industrial apprenticeship and initiating him into a knowledge of his own\u00a0 procedure and formulas, the acquisition of which, as he states, has cost him more than P20,000, and this is to be accepted as true under the demurrer to the written complaint.<br\/><br\/>But\u00a0 it is alleged that if\u00a0 the P10,000 stipulated are not paid to the plaintiff the defendant may not engage in the businesses in which the former is engaged, and in fact the plaintiff asks, in the second part\u00a0 of the complaint, that in default of payment of the\u00a0 said\u00a0 sum, claimed in the first part thereof,\u00a0 the defendant be prohibited\u00a0 from\u00a0 engaging in the manufacture of hats in the Philippine Islands.\u00a0 It is to be observed, however, that the contract does not so state. It is not an expression of its terms, but an\u00a0 interpretation, more or less direct, more or less debatable,\u00a0 of its purview and consequences, and\u00a0 it is very obvious that the validity of\u00a0 a contract is not to be judged\u00a0 by the consequences, perhaps\u00a0 unfounded, which the\u00a0 contracting parties\u00a0 with more or less correctness claim to deduce from it, but by its context.\u00a0 Speaking\u00a0 in\u00a0 general terms and without\u00a0 predetermining the question with regard to the true value of the said interpretation, from the fact of the defendant's binding himself to pay P10,000\u00a0 to the plaintiff in the case provided for in the contract, it might perhaps not necessarily follow that, by not being able to pay the said sum, he could not engage in the same kind of businesses in which the plaintiff is engaged, as would occur, for\u00a0 example, were it decided finally\u00a0 upon the merits that such\u00a0 a payment was not\u00a0 stipulated as a necessary condition in order that the defendant might undertake the class of businesses or industry referred to.\u00a0 In such a case it is evident\u00a0 that\u00a0 the defendant would not be in a worse situation than other\u00a0 debtors\u00a0 who can not pay their debts or comply with their obligations.<br\/><br\/>Be this as it may, this is not the proper time to discuss such an aspect of the question.\u00a0 It is certain that there is no obligation whatever resting upon the defendant, <i>recorded<\/i> in the\u00a0 contract, requiring him not to engage in the same enterprises in which the plaintiff is engaged, even though he might not be able to pay to the latter the P10,000 stipulated therein; and that the sole obligation that is found to be clearly and expressly\u00a0 contracted by the said defendant, with respect to that point, is that he shall pay to the plaintiff the aforementioned sum in the case provided for in the contract, an obligation which we declare to be\u00a0 valid and sufficient, together with the other facts alleged in the complaint, to constitute a cause of action.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 order appealed from\u00a0 is revoked, and the records shall be returned to the trial court so that it may proceed in accordance with law by ordering the defendant to answer the complaint within the regular period.\u00a0 No express finding is made as to the costs of this instance.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i> Arellano, C.

That in the trial of the present case in the first instance and during the period allowed to the defense for producing evidence, the said accused had summoned, the witness Joaquin Garcia Lopez, who was ready to testify that the undersigned had placed at his disposal P50 for each hectare of the lands sold, belonging to the witnesses for the prosecution, Venancio Rodriguez, Ignacio de Gala, and other owners, immediately after the respective sales of the different parcels of land entrusted to the witness by several inhabitants of Sariaya, Tayabas.<br\/><br\/>\"2. That Mr. Pastor Espinosa, municipal president of Sariaya, was also Summoned, and was ready to testify on the same occasion; that the undersigned asked Messrs. Venancio Rodriguez, Ignacio de Gala, and others, in the presence of the said president, if they consented to sell their lands to the railroad company at 50 each hectare, and that said owners agreed to it before signing the declaration of their respective property.<br\/><br\/>\"3. That if both witnesses were not produced it was due to the advice of his attorneys, who assured him (the defendant) that the evidence adduced by the prosecution was of no effect against the undersigned; and, therefore, it was unnecessary to strengthen his testimony by that of the above witnesses.<br\/><br\/>\"4. That the exponent, although he is a lawyer, was not able to understand what was the most necessary for his defense, on account of his condition at the time and owing to the natural disturbance of his mind, and that, for this reason, he was surprised by the advice and the opinion of his attorneys.\"<\/blockquote>This motion must be denied.<br\/><br\/>In criminal as well as in civil cases, it has frequently been held that the fact that blunders and mistakes may have been made in the conduct of the proceedings in the trial court, as a result of the ignorance, inexperience, or incompetence of counsel, does not furnish a ground for a new trial. (14 Enc. PI. &amp; Pr., 733, \"New Trial\" and cases there cited.)<br\/><blockquote>\"If such grounds were to be admitted as reasons for re-opening cases, there would never be an end to a suit s\"o long as new counsel could be employed who could allege and show that prior counsel had not been sufficiently diligent, or experienced, or learned.\" (De Florez <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>. Raynolds, 16 Blatchf. (U. S.), 397.)<br\/><\/blockquote>So it has been held that mistakes of attorneys as to the competency of a witness, the sufficiency, relevancy, materiality, or immateriality of certain evidence, the proper defense, or the burden of proof are not proper grounds for a new trial; and in general the client is bound by the action of his counsel in the conduct of his case, and can not be heard to complain that the result of the litigation might have been different had counsel proceeded differently.<br\/><br\/>The following citation from Darbey <i>vs. <\/i>State (3 S. E. Rep. (Ga.), 666), with which compare State <i>vs.<\/i> Elliott (16 Mo. App., 552), sets out the doctrine in all its rigor:<br\/><blockquote>\"Another ground was that Mr. Jemison, who was counsel for the accused, was unwell at the time of the trial, and neglected to put in some evidence in the case, and that on account of his ill health and irritability he would not allow associate counsel to control the case, and that in a few days after the trial he died. The court certified that Mr. Jemison's mind was perfectly clear, and that he was himself. We can not relieve the accused under circumstances of this kind. He selected Mr. Jemison as a lawyer; he was his leading counsel. He relied upon him, and the court says his mind was perfectly clear; and whether he was a man of as great ability as other counsel might have been can not avail the defendant here, if he employed counsel who conducted his case in such manner as to lead to his conviction. That is his misfortune, for which he alone must be responsible.\"<\/blockquote>It must be admitted, however, that courts of last resort have occasionally relaxed the strict application of this rule in criminal cases, where the defendants, having otherwise a good case, were able to satisfy the court that acquittal would in all probability have followed the introduction of certain testimony, which was not submitted at the trial under improper or injudicious advice of incompetent counsel. (State <i>vs.<\/i> Williams, 27 Vt., 724; State <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>. Jones, 12 Mo. App., 93, criticised and disapproved in a later decision by the same court in State <i>vs.<\/i> Dreher, 137 Mo., 11.) But such cases are extremely rare, and while this court, to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice in a jurisdiction wherein a wholly new system of judicial procedure is being implanted, might in an exceptional case relax the rigor of the rule, this, would be done only under very exceptional circumstances, and in cases where a review of the whole record taken together with the evidence improvidently omitted would clearly justify the conclusion that the omission had resulted in the conviction of one innocent of the crime charged.<br\/><br\/>In the case at bar, defendant himself is an attorney and his counsel appear to have made a vigorous and capable defense on behalf of their client. It is admitted that the testimony which was not offered at the trial was available and might have been introduced at the trial below.\u00a0\u00a0 And we are satisfied that the desirability of putting the witnesses on the stand, whose testimony is now sought to be introduced into the record, was maturely considered; and that their exclusion from the witness stand was not the result of surprise, accident, or the confusion of the trial. This seems clear from the fact that a continuance on motion of counsel for the defense was granted in the court below, based in part upon the absence of Lopez and the alleged importance of his testimony to the defense. We are disposed rather to believe that the reason for the failure to call these witnesses to the stand was that their testimony under strict cross-examination might not have sustained the testimony of the accused in all the details as to the facts concerning which they were able to testify; and however this may be, accused and his counsel, having deliberately elected not to call on these witnesses at the trial, for reasons best known to themselves, the case should not now be opened after conviction to give them an opportunity to put these witnesses on the stand. To do so would be to put a premium on the willful and intentional .commission of errors by accused persons and their counsel, with a view to securing new trials in the event of conviction on the trial wherein the errors and mistakes were committed.<br\/><br\/>Furthermore, we do not think that the introduction into the record of the testimony which the affidavit alleges these witnesses would give on a new trial would or should affect the result.<br\/><br\/>We do not doubt that Rodriguez agreed to sell his land at the rate of 50 pesos per hectare, and indeed the sale could not have been made and the crime of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">estafa<\/span> could not have been committed by the accused had he not done so. The vital question in the court below was the conduct of the accused in inducing him to give his consent and in concealing from him the fact that the purchaser was paying a much higher price than he was receiving.<br\/><br\/>Nor do we think that the testimony of Lopez, as set out in the affidavit, would materially strengthen the case for the defense. So far as it would tend to prove that the funds were paid over to Lopez<i> immediately<\/i> after the sale was made it appears to be in direct conflict with other credible evidence in the record, including the statements of the accused himself as set out in Exhibits A and B of the prosecution ; and even if this fact were admitted as true, it would tend merely to disclose that the <i>estafa<\/i> committed by the accused was committed for the purpose of benefiting a third party rather than himself, a fact which would in no wise relieve him of criminal responsibility.<br\/><br\/>Modified by substituting P101 instead of P87.40 as the amount of money obtained under false pretenses, and to be returned to the offended party, the judgment of conviction and the sentence of the trial court should be and are hereby affirmed with costs against the appellant.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

third\u00a0\u00a0 time on\u00a0 July\u00a0 10,\u00a0 1909,\u00a0 the plaintiff alleged that she was the\u00a0 possessor, in the\u00a0 quality of owner, of two rural properties in the sitio\u00a0 of Monserrate, of\u00a0 the\u00a0 pueblo of\u00a0 Dingras, Ilocos\u00a0 Norte, bounded,\u00a0 one of them, on\u00a0 the north by\u00a0 lands belonging\u00a0 to the\u00a0 heirs of Andres Castro, on the east\u00a0 by those formerly owned by Dionisio Bonoan,\u00a0 and now by\u00a0 Felipe Enrique, on\u00a0 the south by a\u00a0 river, and on the west by the property of Jose Agbayani; and the other of them,\u00a0 on the north\u00a0 by\u00a0 a ditch, on the east by land formerly owned by Dionisio Bonoan,\u00a0 now by Ramos Vicente,\u00a0 on the south by a river,\u00a0 and on the west by the lands belonging to the heirs of Jose Agbayani, said two\u00a0 properties\u00a0 containing\u00a0 an\u00a0 area,\u00a0 respectively, of 36 ares and 60 centares and 67 ares; that in or about the month of\u00a0 July, 1906, the defendant Ramos Vicente unlawfully occupied, without the plaintiff's knowledge, some 21 ares and 25 centares of the first above-described\u00a0 property and two portions of the second, one of 18\u00a0 ares and 26 centares and the other of 2 ares and 40\u00a0 centares, according to the measurements made; wherefore the plaintiff suffered damages in the amount\u00a0 of P60, the value of the\u00a0 products of the said properties which\u00a0 she\u00a0 failed to\u00a0 collect.\u00a0\u00a0 The plaintiff further\u00a0 set\u00a0 forth that as the defendant refused to return\u00a0 the properties\u00a0 she instituted this\u00a0 action for the\u00a0 recovery\u00a0 of possession of the same, and asked that judgment\u00a0 be rendered sentencing the defendant to deliver to the plaintiff the\u00a0 two aforesaid\u00a0 properties\u00a0 and to pay her, as damages, the sum of P60, the value of the products of the land which the\u00a0 latter\u00a0 failed\u00a0 to\u00a0 collect, and to the payment of the costs.<br\/><br\/>The counsel for the defendant, by a writing of July 14, 1909, reproduced in all\u00a0 its parts his answer contained in his writing of August 19, 1908, to the complaint preceding the last amended\u00a0 one, and after a\u00a0 general\u00a0 denial of the essential points which served as a basis for the complaint, alleged as\u00a0 a\u00a0 special defense;\u00a0 that the\u00a0 lands\u00a0 described in paragraph No, 1\u00a0 of\u00a0 the amended complaint\u00a0 were not in the possession of\u00a0 the defendant, according to the area and boundaries of the same therein expressed;\u00a0 that the two parcels of land held by the defendant and which apparently were those claimed\u00a0 by the plaintiff, located in the sitio of Monserrate, of the\u00a0 district of Dingras,\u00a0 had different areas and boundaries from those of the lands\u00a0 which\u00a0 were the subject of the complaint, for one\u00a0 of them\u00a0 measured 170 meters in circumference,\u00a0 equivalent to\u00a0 7 ares and 70 centares, bounded on the\u00a0 north by the land\u00a0 of Esteban Castro, and on the south, east, and west by that of Marcos Manibug,\u00a0 and\u00a0 the other parcel\u00a0 measured 190 meters in circumference\u00a0 equivalent to 17 ares\u00a0 and 20 centares, and was bounded on the north\u00a0 and east by the plaintiff's own lands, and on\u00a0 the south and\u00a0 west\u00a0 by\u00a0 those\u00a0 of\u00a0 Marcos Manibug;\u00a0 that the said two parcels\u00a0 of land belonged exclusively to the defendant, through acquisition by purchase, one of them from the\u00a0 brothers\u00a0 Angel and\u00a0 Felix\u00a0 Reyes, and the other\u00a0 from\u00a0 the sisters Marcelina and\u00a0 Guillerma Lampituc;\u00a0 and that\u00a0 by\u00a0 virtue of this title he had,\u00a0 for more than twenty years, been in the public, peaceable, and uninterrupted possession of the said lands, in the quality of owner thereof.\u00a0 The defendant therefore prayed that in due course of time judgment be rendered in his favor by sentencing\u00a0 the plaintiff\u00a0 to perpetual silence\u00a0 and to\u00a0 the payment of the costs.<br\/><br\/>The case having been heard and oral evidence adduced by both parties, the\u00a0 documents exhibited being attached to the record, the court, in\u00a0 view of the evidence, rendered judgment on August 18, 1909,\u00a0 wherein it found that the plaintiff was the\u00a0 owner of the parcels\u00a0 of land described in the amended complaint and sentenced the defendant to deliver them to the plaintiff.\u00a0 The costs were not assessed against either party.\u00a0 From this judgment' the defendant's counsel appealed and\u00a0 moved for the annulment of the said judgment and the holding of a new trial.\u00a0 This motion was denied, exception was\u00a0 taken by\u00a0 the defendant and the latter's counsel filed\u00a0 the\u00a0 proper bill\u00a0 of exceptions\u00a0 which was approved,\u00a0 certified, and forwarded to the clerk of this court.<br\/><br\/>This is a possessory action\u00a0 brought by the plaintiff for the recovery of possession of two parcels of land usurped several years ago by the defendant and which are situated in the sitio named Monserrate, of the pueblo of Dingras, Ilocos Norte.<br\/><br\/>For the\u00a0 purpose of proving her ownership to the two parcels of land the recovery of which is sought, the plaintiff exhibited her title of composition with the State, issued by the government of the province by delegation of the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Director<\/span> <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">General de Administration Civil, <\/span>on July 19, 1895, which title\u00a0 was\u00a0 shown\u00a0 to\u00a0 have been\u00a0 recorded\u00a0 in the property registry on the 16th of August of the same year.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 two said parcels of land,\u00a0 judging from their\u00a0 respective boundaries and areas, are the first and fifth parcels specified in the aforementioned composition title, and notwithstanding the denial of the defendant and the allegations set forth in his answer that the said two parcels of land can in no manner be identified with any of the five parcels of land described in the said ownership title, it is nevertheless certain that the description of the two parcels of land detained by the defendant and claimed by the plaintiff, is in accord with the description of the aforementioned first and fifth parcels as they appear in the said ownership title.<br\/><br\/>The defendant,\u00a0 while denying that he usurped any property whatever\u00a0 belonging to the\u00a0 plaintiff,\u00a0 alleged that the two parcels\u00a0 of land\u00a0 which he possessed in the aforesaid sitio\u00a0 of Monserrate\u00a0 had\u00a0 different boundaries\u00a0 and areas, and,\u00a0 in order\u00a0 to\u00a0 prove that\u00a0 they belonged exclusively to him,\u00a0 exhibited\u00a0 three private documents, marked with\u00a0 the letters A, B, and C, as\u00a0 titles proving the acquisition of the said lands from the persons whose\u00a0 names are expressed therein.\u00a0\u00a0 These documents, translations of which are found in the record,\u00a0 do\u00a0 not appear to have been duly legalized, do not state the boundaries of the respective\u00a0 lands\u00a0 to which they relate, nor\u00a0 are the signatures\u00a0 of their makers authenticated.<br\/><br\/>It is unquestionable that the plaintiff, Victoria Suguitan, held\u00a0 as\u00a0 owner lands in the said <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">sitio<\/span> which\u00a0 are\u00a0 those described in the title aforementioned, inasmuch as it appears in the\u00a0 record\u00a0 attached thereto, made by the\u00a0 provincial board of composition for the lands of Ilocos Norte, prior to the issuance of the said title\u00a0 and subsequent\u00a0 to the publication of the\u00a0 required notices and the serving of summons on the owners of the adjoining lands, that, on April 4, 1894, the lands, tlie\u00a0 subject of the composition, two\u00a0 of which are concerned in this litigation, were inspected and examined by the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">teniente de sementeras, <\/span>a subordinate agent of the Government, and an expert surveyor, who went\u00a0 to the said barrio of Monserrate, and as a result of the said inspection the board aforementioned certified to the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">capitan municipal<\/span> on\u00a0 February 28,\u00a0 1895, that Victoria Suguitan had, for the past twelve years, held and had been cultivating the lands, the subject of the proceedings, which were examined, and had acquired them by purchase from Juana and Guillerma Bonoan who\u00a0 also\u00a0 had and\u00a0 cultivated them some\u00a0 forty\u00a0 years\u00a0 before.\u00a0 So\u00a0 the said lands\u00a0 have been held and\u00a0 cultivated since more than fifty years,\u00a0 and therefore the plaintiff's ownership right therein is evident and there\u00a0 exists no legal reason\u00a0 whatever\u00a0 which may prevent her being recognized as and declared to be the sole legitimate owner of the two parcels of land in question, among others, and which must be restored to her by their deforciant, the defendant.<br\/><br\/>For\u00a0 the foregoing reasons, and\u00a0 because the judgment appealed from is found to be in accord with the law, it is proper, in our opinion, to affirm\u00a0 the same, as\u00a0 we hereby do, with the\u00a0 coats against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Arellano, C.

Espoy, the\u00a0 head of the Iloilo branch\u00a0 of the aforementioned company,\u00a0 delivered to Alejandro\u00a0 Montelibano y Ramos, among other\u00a0 credits,\u00a0 that of the defendant Escay,\u00a0 for collection; that, on\u00a0 the\u00a0 3d\u00a0 of August, 1906, Vicente Muntadas, the head of the\u00a0 said Iloilo branch, transferred\u00a0 to the said Montelibano y Ramos, by a public instrument, all\u00a0 the rights\u00a0 and\u00a0 actions\u00a0 that pertained to the Compania\u00a0 General\u00a0 de\u00a0 Tabacos\u00a0 with respect to the\u00a0 said\u00a0 debt which\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant Escay still owed, together with the interest thereon\u00a0 from June\u00a0 30, 1905; that by an\u00a0 instrument\u00a0 of\u00a0 the 20th\u00a0 of February,\u00a0 1907, Montelibano\u00a0 y\u00a0 Ramos\u00a0 transferred to\u00a0 the plaintiff\u00a0 Nolan all his rights in\u00a0 the said credit against the defendant Escay, who was duly notified of the\u00a0 transfer made by the company of his\u00a0 debt in favor of Montelibano y\u00a0 Ramos and of the transfer effected by the latter in favor of the plaintiff Nolan;\u00a0 that,\u00a0 notwithstanding\u00a0 the demands, which several times were made to Escay for the payment of his debt, he had not paid the same in whole or in part, nor the interest thereon; that, one day in May,\u00a0 1907, Emilio\u00a0 Escay died, and by an order issued by the judge of the Tenth District, on the\u00a0 14th of August following, his\u00a0 widow, Cristeta Gonzaga, was\u00a0 appointed administratrix of his intestate\u00a0 estate, she having been duly sworn for\u00a0 the purpose on\u00a0 the 2d of September of the same year; that to the amended\u00a0 complaint is\u00a0 attached as\u00a0 a\u00a0 part\u00a0 thereof Exhibit\u00a0 1,\u00a0 a\u00a0 copy\u00a0 of the public instrument of June 6, 1903, executed by the deceased Escay during his lifetime\u00a0 in favor of the\u00a0 said Compaiiia General de Tabacos; and that a\u00a0 copy of the present complaint has been filed with the land registry\u00a0 office\u00a0 of the province; and\u00a0 therefore this court is prayed to\u00a0 render a decision against Cristeta Gonzaga, personally\u00a0 and as the administratrix of the intestate estate of the deceased\u00a0 Escay, by ordering her to pay to the plaintiff the sum of P29,824.43, with interest thereon at the rate\u00a0 of 9 per cent per annum from the\u00a0 30th of June,\u00a0 1905, until its\u00a0 complete\u00a0 payment, and to\u00a0 pay the costs of the suit, and that, in case\u00a0 of insolvency, the sheriff proceed to sell the property given as security, or the part\u00a0 thereof that it\u00a0 be\u00a0 necessary to sell; and to\u00a0 provide any other just and adequate remedy.<br\/><br\/>The document Exhibit 1,\u00a0 which accompanies\u00a0 the complaint, is the instrument executed on the 6th of June, 1903, before the notary Gregorio Yulp, by Emilio Escay y Hernandez and Eduardo Cedrun, as the representative in Iloilo of the Compainia General de Tabacos, and it appears therein that, according to an instrument of the 30th of June, 1902, the said company granted to Emilio Escay a loan of 8,000 pesos,\u00a0 Mexican\u00a0 currency, wherewith\u00a0 to pay the\u00a0 expenses of the Hacienda Lanoglanog, belonging to him and situated within\u00a0 the\u00a0 district of Saravia, Island\u00a0 of Negros,\u00a0 which loan was made\u00a0 for a period of two\u00a0 years\u00a0 from\u00a0 the said date, with\u00a0 interest at 9 per\u00a0 cent per annum,\u00a0 and that\u00a0 as a guaranty and security for compliance with the obligation the debtor, Escay, mortgaged to the said company the said Hacienda\u00a0 Lanoglanog,\u00a0 subsequently called the Teresa,\u00a0 of 179 hectares\u00a0 in\u00a0 area, bounded as described therein, the same being provided with a warehouse of strong materials, a\u00a0 steam engine of\u00a0 9 horsepower, a furnace and\u00a0 other appurtenances for the making of sugar; that, according to the settlement had on the 21st of March, it was found that Escay owed the creditor company the sum of P15,086.43; that notwithstanding this debt, the Compania General de Tabacos granted\u00a0 another new credit of 7,000 pesos to the same party,\u00a0 Escay, in\u00a0 order that\u00a0 he\u00a0 might continue the work of grinding, on his\u00a0 aforesaid hacienda,\u00a0 which sum was to\u00a0 be\u00a0 delivered to him in installments\u00a0 in the\u00a0 months and for the purposes expressed in the\u00a0 instrument and, added to the previous sum of\u00a0 15,086.43 pesos, made a total of P22,086.43,\u00a0 the\u00a0 debtor being allowed, by regular deliveries of\u00a0 sugar\u00a0 in Iloilo, P1.50 for each picul of sugar; that the debtor Escay\u00a0 agreed\u00a0 to deliver to\u00a0 the creditor company the entire crop of the years\u00a0 1903\u00a0 and 1904 that should\u00a0 be\u00a0 produced on\u00a0 his hacienda, estimated at 5,000 piculs of sugar, without his selling\u00a0 or\u00a0 assigning to\u00a0 anyone else or\u00a0 deducting therefrom the smallest portion for any consideration or under any pretext; that\u00a0 the deliveries of the sugar were to be made until the\u00a0 1st of\u00a0 March, 1905, fixed as the date when\u00a0 the entire crop should be ground, the company reserving the right to place an agent on the hacienda, at\u00a0 the\u00a0 expense of the debtor Escay, whenever it\u00a0 should so consider proper; that the amounts received, as well\u00a0 as\u00a0 those the debtor should\u00a0 receive up to the total of the credit allowed, should draw\u00a0 interest at the\u00a0 rate of 9 per cent\u00a0 per annum, from the date of their receipt, the aforesaid 1st of March, 1905, being fixed as the date for the settlement\u00a0 of the\u00a0 payments of capital and interest; that it was agreed that, if the sugar of the crop of 1903-4 should be insufficient to balance the accounts of the\u00a0 debtor, the crop of\u00a0 1904-5 should be\u00a0 delivered to the creditor company in the same manner\u00a0 and under the same conditions,\u00a0 the date for the\u00a0 complete payment and settlement of the capital\u00a0 and\u00a0 interest in such case\u00a0 to\u00a0 be\u00a0 extended; that, among other conditions and in all cases, Escay should allow the company 1% per cent as commission on the total amount of the sugar delivered;\u00a0 that as\u00a0 security and for the purpose of an exact compliance with the engagements contained in the said instrument, the debtor Escay deeded, conveyed, and sold to the creditor company\u00a0 all the fruits and crops of his hacienda, delivering them by <i>traditio manu longa <\/i>and transferring\u00a0 full dominion over them until the debt should be satisfied; that in case of failure to pay the same on\u00a0 the\u00a0 conditions expressed,,\u00a0 the\u00a0 creditor company could,\u00a0 if\u00a0 it so wished,\u00a0 take possession of the said fruits and crops, sell them or store them, .for which\u00a0 purpose the debtor Escay conferred ample\u00a0 and\u00a0 sufficient power, without limitation whatever, in favor of the creditor company, binding himself to hold as proper and final whatever proceedings might be taken by the latter by virtue of this instrument; that,\u00a0 notwithstanding all the foregoing, the debtor Escay had agreed to sell under <i>pacto de retro,<\/i> as a guaranty\u00a0 for the\u00a0 due fulfilment of the obligation assumed by\u00a0 him, the Hacienda Lanoglanog, now called the\u00a0 Teresa, of which he was the owner, together with all the buildings, machinery, and other appurtenances existing thereon, and a house constructed of\u00a0 stone and wood\u00a0 with\u00a0 a zinc\u00a0 roof, belonging to\u00a0 his\u00a0 wife,\u00a0 Cristeta\u00a0 Gonzaga, and\u00a0 situated in the town of Bacolod, for the sum of P22,086.43, on condition that if, during the\u00a0 term stipulated or before the 1st of March,\u00a0 1905,\u00a0 he\u00a0 should pay all\u00a0 the said sum, with the interest due\u00a0 thereon, to the creditor\u00a0 company, with the deliveries of sugar agreed upon, the latter would execute to him an instrument of reversion of the said hacienda and house; but if the said\u00a0 term, to\u00a0 terminate on the 1st of March,\u00a0 1905,\u00a0 should elapse and\u00a0 the debtor Escay should be unable to avail himself of his right of redemption, then this sale should assume the character of one absolutely and irrevocably consummated and the company should be considered\u00a0 to have acquired all the rights pertaining to\u00a0 it in connection with the\u00a0 said properties; that it was also stipulated\u00a0 between both parties that, if the company should take possession of the properties sold for any reason whatever,\u00a0 at any time, that it should collect the principal and interest owing by\u00a0 Escay,\u00a0 the latter or\u00a0 his heirs should recover the absolute ownership of the said properties, the debtor binding himself,\u00a0 in\u00a0 his own name and in that of his wife,\u00a0 who, for\u00a0 this purpose, had conferred power on him by an instrument executed in Bacolod,\u00a0 June 1,\u00a0 1903, to guarantee the company\u00a0 the peaceful possession of the property.<br\/><br\/>On the\u00a0 25th of November,\u00a0 1907, the defendant Cristeta Gonzaga filed, with the permission of the court, an amended answer, setting forth that\u00a0 she admitted the facts alleged in paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and\u00a0 10 of the amended complaint; that she denied the facts alleged in\u00a0 paragraphs 4 and 9 of the same, and reserved her answer with regard to the exactness of the copy of the said instrument, Exhibit 1, until she should have compared it with its original; that as a special defense she alleged that in the instrument of acknowledgment of\u00a0 the\u00a0 debt,\u00a0 executed on June\u00a0 6,\u00a0 1903, before the notary Yulo,\u00a0 the following condition\u00a0 was stipulated between the\u00a0 parties: It is agreed by both contracting parties that should the\u00a0 Compania General de Tabacos, for any reason whatever, take possession of the properties sold, as soon as the latter shall have collected the principal and interest owing it by the said Escay,\u00a0 it shall return to him or to his heirs the ownership of the properties concerned; and,\u00a0 therefore,\u00a0 the defendant prayed the\u00a0 court to absolve her from the complaint, with the costs in her favor.<br\/><br\/>The case having come to trial and\u00a0 the parol evidence having been adduced by both parties,\u00a0 the exhibits being made a part of the record, the judge, on January 30,\u00a0 1908, rendered judgment in the\u00a0 case, sentencing the defendant personally and as the administratrix of the intestate estate of\u00a0 her deceased husband,\u00a0 Emilio\u00a0 Escay, to pay to the plaintiff the sum of P29,824.43 and the interest thereon at the rate of 9 per cent per annum from the 1st of\u00a0 July, 1906,\u00a0 until paid, and the\u00a0 costs.\u00a0 Against this judgment the defendant party took exception and prayed for a new trial, on the ground that the said judgment was manifestly contrary to the\u00a0 weight of the evidence, which petition was denied\u00a0 by\u00a0 the court,\u00a0 on February 8,\u00a0 1908, and exception taken\u00a0 thereto by the appellant, who duly filed the\u00a0 corresponding bill\u00a0 of exceptions\u00a0 which was\u00a0 approved\u00a0 and transmitted to the office of the clerk\u00a0 of this\u00a0 court.<br\/><br\/>It is asserted in appellant's\u00a0 brief that the\u00a0 lower court, in passing judgment\u00a0 in this case, incurred the following errors:<br\/><ol type=\"I\"><li>The lower\u00a0 court erred in\u00a0 finding that Emilio Escay owed the\u00a0 Compania General de\u00a0 Tabacos de Filipinas, on June 20, 1905, the net\u00a0 sum of P29,824.43.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>The\u00a0 lower court erred in\u00a0 stating that\u00a0 it\u00a0 had been proved\u00a0 that the\u00a0 deceased Escay, while still living, received a demand for the payment of the said balance of P29.824.43, and that he gave no heed whatever thereto.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>The lower court erred in finding that Exhibit 1 sets forth stipulations whjch clearly show that the credit\u00a0 was a mortgage one.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>The\u00a0 lower court erred in\u00a0 deciding, when interpreting the substance of the contract, that the parties to this suit are convinced that the amount claimed is a mortgage debt, and that\u00a0 the contract,\u00a0 Exhibit\u00a0 1,\u00a0 is a\u00a0 mortgage\u00a0 credit against Escay, and not a\u00a0 sale under <i>pacto de\u00a0 retro. <\/i><br\/><br\/><\/li><li>The\u00a0 lower court erred\u00a0 in finding that the covenant alleged\u00a0 by\u00a0 the defendant\u00a0 in the\u00a0 special defense contained in her answer, is a conditional\u00a0 covenant which gave to the creditor the right to take\u00a0 and keep possession\u00a0 of the properties\u00a0 during the term allowed\u00a0 for\u00a0 the\u00a0 payment\u00a0 of the debt, and\u00a0 never could\u00a0 be understood to be\u00a0 a perpetual covenant.<\/li><\/ol>Apparently, it is shown by the statements\u00a0 set forth in the judgment appealed from\u00a0 and by the terms of the sentence contained\u00a0 therein,\u00a0 that the court, in harmony with the tenor\u00a0 of\u00a0 the complaint,\u00a0 was of the opinion that the complaint claimed payment of a mortgage credit by virtue of the stipulations\u00a0 of an\u00a0 instrument of the date of June 6, 1903.<br\/><br\/>It is true that, judging\u00a0 from the\u00a0 statements made\u00a0 by the debtor Emilio Escay in the said instrument, the latter received as a loan from the Compania General\u00a0 de Tabacos various sums aggregating P22,086.43, bearing\u00a0 interest at 9\u00a0 per cent per annum; but it is no less true that the said debtor, to\u00a0 insure the fulfillment of the engagement\u00a0 to pay his debt with the sugar that he might succeed in producing on his\u00a0 Hacienda Lanoglanog or Teresa during the years 1903,1904, and\u00a0 1905, had to deed over and convey by sale to his creditor all\u00a0 the fruits and crops\u00a0 of the\u00a0 said hacienda, authorizing the\u00a0 latter, in case of nonpayment, to take possession of the said\u00a0 fruits and\u00a0 crops, to dispose of them and to sell them, and he also agreed\u00a0 to sell to the creditor company the\u00a0 said hacienda under pacto de retro, together with\u00a0 its buildings,\u00a0 machinery, and. other\u00a0 appurtenances existing thereon, and\u00a0 the house owned\u00a0 by\u00a0 his\u00a0 wife, Cristeta Gonzaga, situated in\u00a0 the\u00a0 town\u00a0 of Bacolod, for\u00a0 the aforesaid\u00a0 sum received as a loan, the company binding itself to resell\u00a0 to him the\u00a0 said properties\u00a0 if\u00a0 the\u00a0 debtor should be able to pay his\u00a0 debt\u00a0 with\u00a0 sugar; otherwise\u00a0 the sale was to be absolute and irrevocable.<br\/><br\/>It was\u00a0 also stipulated\u00a0 between\u00a0 the\u00a0 contracting parties that should the company take possession, for any\u00a0 reason whatever, of the properties\u00a0 sold, once it had collected\u00a0 the principal\u00a0 and interest due, the\u00a0 ownership of the said properties\u00a0 should revert\u00a0 to the debtor Escay or\u00a0 to\u00a0 his heirs.<br\/><br\/>With the exception\u00a0 of these stipulations\u00a0 and the clause guaranteeing possession, the aforesaid instrument expresses no special\u00a0 contract\u00a0 of mortgage\u00a0 of the said\u00a0 properties, nor any agreement nor even a statement reproducing\u00a0 or maintaining, in\u00a0 the said instrument of 1903, the mortgage contracted\u00a0 in the previous\u00a0 instrument of June, 1902,\u00a0 for this latter\u00a0 concerns\u00a0 a loan of P8,000, and\u00a0 the mere reference made in the former to this credit, secured by a mortgage on the said hacienda, and the fact of such\u00a0 loan being included, on account of its not having\u00a0 been paid,\u00a0 in a larger one which is the subject of the said subsequent instrument of\u00a0 1903, is not sufficient to show the\u00a0 existence of a mortgage, without the manifest will of the\u00a0 interested parties, when what was expressly stipulated afterwards\u00a0 is a sale with right of repurchase.<br\/><br\/>On the foregoing hypothesis, it is unquestionably evident that the plaintiff\u00a0 party,\u00a0 the\u00a0 cessionary of the rights\u00a0 of the Compafiia General de Tabacos, is not entitled\u00a0 to prosecute an action\u00a0 for the\u00a0 collection of a mortgage credit on realty, under the\u00a0 authority\u00a0 of the provisions\u00a0 of articles 254 et seq. of the Code of Civil Procedure and by virtue of a contract of mortgage based on, articles 1874 et seq. of the Civil Code and articles 138 et seq. of the Mortgage Law.<br\/><br\/>The sum loaned to\u00a0 the debtor was converted\u00a0 into the selling price\u00a0 of the properties specified in the said instrument, according to the stipulations therein made between the contracting parties, and the term agreed\u00a0 upon for the repurchase has much more than elapsed; and although the debtor remained in possession of the\u00a0 said properties sold, notwithstanding his not\u00a0 having\u00a0 duly repurchased them, the creditor has not thereby lost his right thereto,\u00a0 provided he exercises\u00a0 it in due time, by virtue\u00a0 of the contract contained in the said instrument of June 6,\u00a0 1903.\u00a0 (Arts. 1507,\u00a0 1509, 1518, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>The defendant appellant acknowledges the fact and the legitimacy of the sale with right of repurchase aforementioned, and he has not alleged any ground whatever by virtue of which the said contract of sale may be considered dissolved and without\u00a0 legal\u00a0 effect and\u00a0 the return of its price\u00a0 demanded; wherefore the suit filed by the plaintiff Ricardo Nolan\u00a0 is\u00a0 from all points of\u00a0 view improper, and therefore\u00a0 the judgment appealed\u00a0 from\u00a0 can not be\u00a0 sustained, the court below having incurred errors 3\u00a0 and 4 of those\u00a0 alleged by the appellant, as hereinbefore shown.\u00a0 In view of the nature and fundamental basis of this\u00a0 decision, it is not necessary to discuss the propriety or impropriety of the other\u00a0 errors attributed to the judgment.<br\/><br\/>Wherefore, it is proper in our opinion, in reversing the judgment appealed from,\u00a0 to absolve, as we do hereby absolve, from the said complaint the defendant Cristeta Gonzaga,personally\u00a0 and as the administratrix\u00a0 of the estate of\u00a0 her deceased\u00a0 husband\u00a0 Emilio\u00a0 Escay,\u00a0 without special finding as to the\u00a0 costs in both instances, and to the plaintiff is reserved his rights pursuant to the agreement contained\u00a0 in the instrument\u00a0 aforesaid, and\u00a0 he\u00a0 may exercise the same, should he\u00a0 deem\u00a0 proper so to do, in conformity with\u00a0 the law.<br\/><br\/><i> Arellano, C.

The demurrer was overruled but no exception taken. In his answer the defendant alleged that the plaintiff, on the 17th day of May, 1905, asked him to admit her as a co-partner with him in a certain business known as the \"Funeraria Filipina\" (undertaking establishment) ; that he granted this request of the plaintiff after having obtained the intervention and consent of her husband, Gregorio Francisco; that the said Gregorio Francisco turned over to him the P1,000 in question, which represented the plaintiff's interest in said business; that he made and signed a receipt for this amount, in which he stated the purposes for which the same was received; and that on the 17th day of May, 1907, at the request of the plaintiff, he modified or changed the said receipt so as to make it appear in the same that he did borrow this money from the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>The trial court rendered judgment, on the 30th of March, 1909, in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of P846, with interest at the rate of 6 per cent per annum from the 17th day of May, 1908, and for the costs. The defendant appealed, and now insists that the plaintiff has no right to recover in this action until after a liquidation or settlement of the undertaking business, in which the Pl,000 represents the plaintiff's interest, has been made.<br\/><br\/>The note or receipt which forms the basis of this action is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Received from Valentina Hernandez de Francisco the sum of one thousand pesos, Philippine currency, which will be returned to her within one year from the 17th of May, last, as per agreement.<br\/><br\/>\"Manila, June 12, 1907.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: right;\">\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0(Sgd.)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"DOMINGO ANTONIO.<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"NOTE. - To guarantee the performance of the above agreement I hereby pledge my account in participation which I have in the <i>'Funeraria Filipina.'<\/i><br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: right;\">\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0(Sgd.)\u00a0\u00a0 \"D.

FRANCISCO.\"<\/div><\/blockquote>The defendant admits having signed the above note or receipt in which he specifically stated that he received from the plaintiff the sum of P1,000, agreeing to return the same at a specified time. No mention is made in this note of any previous contract or agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant. It is true that the husband of the plaintiff made and signed the memorandum on the back of this note, but such memorandum can not in any way change the contractual relations between the plaintiff and the defendant. The plaintiff's husband was not present at the time this note was executed and the money turned over to the defendant, neither was the plaintiff present at the time her husband signed the memorandum on the back of said note.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff testified positively that she loaned the defendant this P1,000 in cash out of her own private funds. The defendant corroborates in one essential feature the testimony of the plaintiff in his letter dated June 1, 1908, in which he asked for an extension of time within which to satisfy this debt, saying that on the 17th of August he would pay the same. In fact he did pay the sum of P154 on this debt after executing the note.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff in this case had a right to maintain this action under the provisions of paragraph 1, section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure, inasmuch as the proof shows that the P1,000 loaned to the defendant was her exclusive property and her husband had no interest in the same. The defendant having borrowed this money from the plaintiff without the intervention of her husband, on account of his having no interest in the same, can not now claim that the plaintiff can not maintain an action to recover this loan. He accepted the money knowing that it belonged to the plaintiff. In order to make this loan it was not necessary, under these facts, for the plaintiff to obtain the consent of her husband, neither is it necessary for her husband to be joined with her in this action.<br\/><br\/>The terms of this contract of loan are clear and leave no doubt as to the intention of the contracting parties. The literal sense of its stipulations must be observed. (Art. 1281, Civil Code; Azarraga<i> vs.<\/i> Rodriguez, 9 Phil. Rep., 637.)<br\/><br\/>The defendant in this note or receipt made no attempt to express any other meaning than that of a plain simple loan with a specific promise to return same, and the law presumes that he meant what he said. (Clark <i>vs<\/i>. Lillie, 39 Vt., 405.)<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is, therefore, affirmed, with costs against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

That the said seven parcels\u00a0 of land in the year 1902 were\u00a0 declared by Escolastico Amier as his property.<br\/><br\/>Fourth.\u00a0 That on\u00a0 the 7th day of May,\u00a0 1903, said seven parcels of\u00a0 land were sold at public sale on account of the territorial\u00a0 tax on\u00a0 the same\u00a0 not having been\u00a0 paid by their owner, Escolastico Amier, or by any other person.<br\/><br\/>Fifth. That on the 7th\u00a0 day\u00a0 of May,\u00a0 1903,\u00a0 Gaudencio Apuya bought said seven\u00a0 parcels of land at the said public sale and received a certificate of sale\u00a0 therefor.<br\/><br\/>Sixth. That said\u00a0 Gaudencio Apuya on the 23d\u00a0 day\u00a0 of June,\u00a0 1903. sold said certificate of sale and all his interest in the same to Rosalia Diasanta, and the latter, on\u00a0 the 5th day of September, 1907, sold all her rights in the said\u00a0 lands to the plaintiff herein, Serafin Belarmino.<br\/><br\/>Seventh. That on the 23d day of August, 1906, Rosalia Diasanta, as\u00a0 assignee of Gaudencio Apuya, received from the provincial treasurer of Albay, in her name, a deed of the said\u00a0 seven parcels of\u00a0 land, the same not having been redeemed by said Escolastico Amier or by any other person.<br\/><br\/>Eighth. That said seven parcels of land were later twice sold at public sale for failure to pay the territorial tax and were each time redeemed by said Rosalia Diasanta.<br\/><br\/>Ninth. That Gaudencio\u00a0 Apuya died\u00a0 on the 21st day of February, 1907, leaving as his only heirs at law\u00a0 and next of kin his widow, Atanacia Cafe, and\u00a0 a brother of\u00a0 the deceased, Juan Apuya, who are the only persons who have the\u00a0 right to be declared heirs of the said deceased.<br\/><br\/>Tenth. That Estanislao Amier\u00a0 died in\u00a0 the\u00a0 year\u00a0 1892, leaving as his only heirs at law and next of kin his nieces Miguela,\u00a0 Juliana, Celedonia, and\u00a0 Quintin, surnamed Baquizal, Severiha\u00a0 Yanzon, the deceased Escolastico Amier and his heirs and grandchildren, Bibiana Arao and\u00a0 Roque Yanzon, all of whom would be heirs in case of the declaration of heirship of the said Estanislao Amier.<br\/><br\/>Eleventh. That Gaudencio Apuya and Estanislao Amier died intestate, leaving their property undivided and without a partition of the same among their heirs.<br\/><br\/>Twelfth. That Bibiana Arao is actually administratrix of the estate of Estanislao Amier, deceased, being duly named as such by the court.<br\/><br\/>Thirteenth.\u00a0 That Escolastico\u00a0 Amier\u00a0 was authorized\u00a0 by the defendants to declare the said seven parcels of land for taxation but was\u00a0 not authorized\u00a0 to declare\u00a0 them as his exclusive property.<br\/><br\/>Upon these\u00a0 facts the court below found in favor of the plaintiffs, declaring them owners\u00a0 of the\u00a0 seven\u00a0 parcels of land and ordering that the defendants deliver the possession ojf the same to the\u00a0 plaintiffs.\u00a0\u00a0 From this judgment this appeal was taken.<br\/><br\/>The appellants in\u00a0 this court made several assignments of error.\u00a0 The only one we\u00a0 need to consider is that wherein\u00a0 they claim that the judge erred in finding that the assignment of the certificate of sale by Apuya to Diasanta was valid and that the deed subsequently made by the treasurer of the Province of Albay to the said Diasanta, pursuant to said certificate, transferred\u00a0 the\u00a0 title to said lands to the said Diasanta.<br\/><br\/>This precise question has been passed upon by this court in the case of Black <i>vs.<\/i>\u00a0 Nygren\u00a0 (8 Phil. Rep., 205).\u00a0\u00a0 In that case the court, speaking through Mr. Justice Johnson, says (p. 206):<br\/><blockquote>\"From the record the following facts appear:<br\/><br\/>\"(1) That on the 28th day of January,\u00a0 1905, the acting provincial treasurer of the Province of Pampanga issued to one\u00a0 S. S. McVey,\u00a0 a certificate of tax sale\u00a0 for certain land sold at a tax sale in said Province of Pampanga.<br\/><br\/>\"(2). On\u00a0 the 10th\u00a0 day of August, 1906, the said S. S. McVey, assigned the said certificate of tax sale to the plaintiff herein.<br\/><br\/>\"(3) On\u00a0 the 13th day\u00a0 of September, 1906, the plaintiff herein filed\u00a0 a petition\u00a0 in this court, praying that a writ of mandamus be issued against the defendant herein, as treasurer of said Province of Pampanga, to compel him to issue to the plaintiff a\u00a0 tax\u00a0 deed to the lands described\u00a0 in said certificate of tax sale.<br\/><br\/>\"(4) On\u00a0 the 30th\u00a0 day of October, 1906, the Attorney-General\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 Philippine Islands,\u00a0 representing the\u00a0 said treasurer, filed a demurrer to said petition for mandamus, upon the ground\u00a0 that the complaint\u00a0 did\u00a0 not\u00a0 state\u00a0 facts sufficient to\u00a0 constitute\u00a0 a cause of\u00a0 action, specifically stating the reasons therefor.\u00a0 Said\u00a0 demurrer\u00a0 was.heard by this court on the 12th day\u00a0 of November, 1906.<br\/><br\/>\"The question presented is whether or not the plaintiff is entitled to a writ\u00a0 of\u00a0 mandamus under the\u00a0 provisions of law in force in\u00a0 the Philippine Islands.\u00a0 It is\u00a0 the general rule\u00a0 that a\u00a0 writ of mandamus wiJl not lie against a\u00a0 corporation, board, or officer to compel him\u00a0 or them to perform any specific\u00a0 duty unless such duty is clearly defined by the law or by virtue of an official duty or relation.<br\/><br\/>\"Section 80 of the Municipal Code (Act No. 82) provides:<br\/><br\/>\" 'In case\u00a0 the taxpayer shall not redeem the land sold as above provided within one\u00a0 year from the date of sale, the provincial treasurer, or his deputy, in the name of such treasurer,\u00a0 shall, as grantor, execute a\u00a0 deed\u00a0 in form and effect sufficient\u00a0 under the laws of the Islands to convey to the purchaser so much of the land against which the taxes have been\u00a0 assessed as has been sold, free from all liens of any kind whatsoever, and the\u00a0 deeds shall succinctly\u00a0 recite all the proceedings upon which\u00a0 the validity of\u00a0 the sale depends.'<br\/><br\/>\"It will\u00a0 be noted from the above provision of the said Municipal Code that the treasurer or his deputy shall execute the deed, under the provisions of said Municipal\u00a0 Code, to the <i>purchaser. <\/i>\u00a0 The plaintiff herein is the assignee of the purchaser.\u00a0\u00a0 The law gave to the purchaser at the tax sale alone the right to have the deed executed to him.\u00a0 The law made no provision to have the said tax\u00a0 deed issued to the assignee of\u00a0 the purchaser.\u00a0 This provision\u00a0 of the\u00a0 said Municipal Code\u00a0 seems to have been taken from section 489 of the\u00a0 statutes of the State of\u00a0 Vermont, and the courts of that State have\u00a0 held, together with nearly all the States of the Union,\u00a0 that every statute which provides\u00a0 a method by which\u00a0 a person may be divested\u00a0 of his\u00a0 property\u00a0 under a special authority, must be construed strictly.<br\/><br\/>\"In\u00a0 the\u00a0 case\u00a0 of Thatcher <i>vs. <\/i>Powell\u00a0 (6\u00a0 Wheaton,\u00a0 119, 123) the Supreme Court of the United States\u00a0 said:<br\/><br\/>\" 'That no\u00a0 individual or public officer can sell and convey a good title to the land\u00a0 of another, unless authorized so to do by express law, is one of those self-evident propositions to which the\u00a0 mind assents without hesitation;\u00a0 and that the person invested with such a power must pursue with precision the course prescribed by law,\u00a0 or his\u00a0 act is invalid, is a principle which\u00a0 has been repeatedly recognized in\u00a0 this court.'<br\/><br\/>\"And again, in the case of Alexander <i>vs<\/i>. Savage (90 Ala., 383), the Supreme Court of Alabama held:<br\/><br\/>\" 'A\u00a0 tax deed made to\u00a0 one <i>substituted for the purchaser,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/i> or to any grantee other than the one <i>sanctioned by the statute <\/i>is void.\u00a0\u00a0 The statutory authority to convey must be strictly pursued and the deed made only to\u00a0 those to whom he is authorized by law to execute it.\u00a0\u00a0 (Keen <i>vs<\/i>. Houghton, 19 Maine, 368.)'<br\/><br\/>\"The law in\u00a0 the present case required the defendant to execute the deed to the purchaser under the tax sale.\u00a0 The demurrer is therefore hereby sustained and the plaintiff is hereby\u00a0 given ten\u00a0 days\u00a0 from\u00a0 the\u00a0 notice\u00a0 of this decision within which to amend his complaint, or otherwise the case will be dismissed with costs to the plaintiff.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.\"<\/blockquote>By virtue of the authority of the above case, holding that the certificate of sale is\u00a0 not assignable and that a deed to any person other than the purchaser at the sale is void, the judgment of the court below\u00a0 is hereby reversed and the plaintiffs' complaint dismissed, without special finding as to costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Castro worked in the reconstruction of this house from the 15th of April to the 23d of April, inclusive.\u00a0 The charge against the accused is that he reported\u00a0 Castro\u00a0 upon his time book as working for the city when in reality he was working for the accused, and that\u00a0 he thereby sought to defraud the city of the sum which it would have paid for such labor.<br\/><br\/>The accused was charged in the Court of First Instance of Manila with the crime of falsification of a public document by a public official,\u00a0 was\u00a0 duly tried thereon, convicted and sentenced to twelve years and\u00a0 one day of cadena temporal\u00a0 He appealed.<br\/><br\/>It appears from \"the facts as detailed above that there was an entire absence of criminal intent on the part of the accused.\u00a0 If the right of Severino Pelagio to have his house rebuilt at the expense of the city, both as to workmen and materials, was a\u00a0 transferable right, a question we do not here decide, then that right passed to the\u00a0 accused. Whether\u00a0 or\u00a0 not\u00a0 that\u00a0 right\u00a0 passed\u00a0 by the\u00a0 transfer,\u00a0 the accused evidently believed it did and acted upon that belief without attempt at concealment or evasion.\u00a0 Accordingly, believing that the city was in duty bound to rebuild the house which his wife had purchased of Severino, he saw no more harm or wrong\u00a0 in charging against the\u00a0 city the time spent by the carpenter Castro in rebuilding it than in charging against the city the time\u00a0 spent by other carpenters who were rebuilding the other houses that had been removed under exactly the same circumstances.<br\/><br\/>While the methods pursued by the defendant are subject to criticism and were very properly objected to by the city, we are of the opinion\u00a0 that he should be\u00a0 dealt with civilly or administratively rather than criminally.<br\/><br\/>The judgment\u00a0 of the\u00a0 court below\u00a0 is\u00a0 hereby\u00a0 reversed, the defendant acquitted\u00a0 and his discharge from custody ordered;\u00a0 costs de oflcio.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Upon receipt of such notification\u00a0 the Land Court ordered that publication be made of the notices required by law, and notice was accordingly issued under the\u00a0 seal of the Land Court directed to\u00a0 the owners and occupants of the lands therein described and to all persons having and claiming to have an interest\u00a0 therein, requiring them within, six calendar months from the date of such notice to present application to the said court to have said lands or interest therein\u00a0 registered under the provisions\u00a0 of the Land Registration Act, and notifying all such persons that unless such application was presented within the time prescribed that the said lands or interest therein\u00a0 would be conclusively adjudged\u00a0 to be public lands and all claims on the part of private individuals not so presented forever barred.\u00a0\u00a0 Such notice was dated July 8,\u00a0 1905, and publication of the\u00a0 same was duly made\u00a0 as required by law.\u00a0\u00a0 Prior to the expiration of the six months' period fixed in\u00a0 said notice and on the 27th day of December, 1905, the time for the presentation of claims was by the order of the judge of said court extended three months.\u00a0\u00a0 Said three months' extension expired on the 17th day\u00a0 of April,\u00a0 1906.\u00a0 The petition in this case was not filed with the clerk of the Court of Land Registration until long after the 17th day of April, 1906, and long after the expiration of the period fixed by law as extended by the court.\u00a0\u00a0 This case raises the square issue of the legality or constitutionality of\u00a0 section 4 of Act No. 627.\u00a0 The petitioners claim that section 4 of Act No. 627 confiscates the property of the petitioners without the process of law, and\u00a0 consequently is\u00a0 null and void.'\u00a0\u00a0 (Pp. 146 to 148 of case.)<br\/><br\/>\"In Twining<i> vs.<\/i> New Jersey (29 Supreme Court Reporter, 14, 20), Mr. Justice Moody says of 'due process of law:'<br\/><br\/>\"'Few phrases of the law are so elusive of exact apprehension as this.\u00a0 Doubtless the difficulties of ascertaining its connotation have been increased in American jurisprudence, where it has been embodied in constitution and put to new uses as a limit on legislative power.\u00a0 This\u00a0 court has always\u00a0 declined to give a comprehensive definition of it, and has preferred\u00a0 that its\u00a0 full meaning should be\u00a0 gradually ascertained by the process of inclusion and exclusion in the course of the decisions of cases as they arise.\u00a0\u00a0 There are certain general principles, well settled, however, which narrow the\u00a0 field\u00a0 of discussion, and may serve as helps to correct conclusions.

This testimony is not convincing, and we agree with the trial judge that it is wholly insufficient to raise a doubt as to the truth and accuracy of the identification of the defendant by the witnesses for the prosecution as one of the members of the band who entered the barrio of Carmen on the night in question.<br\/><br\/>The trial court properly found\u00a0 that the defendant was guilty, as a principal, of the crime of assassination, marked by the qualifying circumstance\u00a0 of <i>alevosia<\/i> (treachery), in that the deceased was done to\u00a0 death with his elbows tied behind\u00a0 his back, and marked\u00a0 further with the generic aggravating circumstances of nocturnity, its commission in a\u00a0 deserted place by disguised persons, and by the fact that the victim was carried off to his death from his\u00a0 own house. Upon this finding of facts, and in view of the further fact that the record discloses none of the extenuating circumstances set out in article 9 of the\u00a0 Penal Code, there can be no doubt that the capital penalty was properly imposed\u00a0 by the trial\u00a0 court, unless,\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 exercise of the\u00a0 discretion vested in\u00a0 the courts, the extenuating circumstance of race should be taken into consideration in favor of the defendant, under the provisions of article 11 of the code.<br\/><br\/>With some hesitation, we have concluded to give the\u00a0 appellant\u00a0 the benefit of the provisions of this\u00a0 article.\u00a0\u00a0 In doing so,\u00a0 we are largely influenced by\u00a0 the fact that the record fails to disclose the motive for the commission of the crime, and by\u00a0 the further fact\u00a0 that it was committed\u00a0 six years ago, at a period when\u00a0 many thousands of misguided persons were induced to become members of roving bands, organized ostensibly\u00a0 for political purposes, but in many cases, in truth and in fact,\u00a0 for robbery and pillage, and were thus drawn into a guilty participation in the commission of grave and heinous offenses.<br\/><br\/>To suppress these bands, the Brigandage Act was passed by the Commission fixing the penalty to be imposed upon members of such\u00a0 bands when convicted of the\u00a0 crime of brigandage at from twenty years'\u00a0 imprisonment\u00a0 to death, in the discretion of the courts.\u00a0 In the exercise of this\u00a0 discretion this court has uniformly declined to affirm the\u00a0 imposition of capital penalties\u00a0 on members\u00a0 of\u00a0 such bands, unless\u00a0 the record\u00a0 affirmatively discloses that the convict was either a\u00a0 chief or one of\u00a0 the active leaders of a band which had been guilty of grave and heinous offenses other than robbery, or that he had\u00a0 directly and actively participated in the commission of such grave and heinous offenses. This rule, in\u00a0 effect,\u00a0 applies the principle involved in\u00a0 the provisions of article 11\u00a0 of the Penal\u00a0 Code,\u00a0 whereby\u00a0 the ignorance and lack of instruction of native offenders may in proper cases be\u00a0 taken into\u00a0 consideration\u00a0 as an extenuating\u00a0 circumstance, recognizing as it does that, as a result of the\u00a0 unsettled conditions existing\u00a0 in\u00a0 many\u00a0 localities in these Islands\u00a0 for several years after the establishment of civil authority under American sovereignty, many ignorant and simple-minded natives were drawn into guilty participation,\u00a0 as members of brigand\u00a0 bands,\u00a0 in the commission of offenses by their more desperate leaders and associates, of which they would\u00a0 never have\u00a0 been\u00a0 guilty under normal conditions.<br\/><br\/>The facts disclosed by the record in the case at\u00a0 bar tend strongly to disclose that, when the crime in question was committed, the accused was a\u00a0 member of one of the roving bands of brigands\u00a0 which were so numerous at that time, although the absence of proof of a motive for the crime leaves the precise character of the\u00a0 band in\u00a0 doubt.\u00a0 But it is clear that in the absence of proof that the accused was a leader of the band, or that he directly and actively participated in the assassination of the prisoner taken by the band, he would not have been sentenced to the death penalty had the evidence disclosed that the band of which he was a member was a band of brigands, and had he been convicted under the provisions of\u00a0 the Brigandage Act.<br\/><br\/>Under all the circumstances, we think that,\u00a0 taking into consideration the provisions of article 11 of the Penal Code as an extenuating circumstance, the penalty imposed upon the appellant should be reduced to life imprisonment, thus securing to him the exercise of a similar degree of leniency in the consideration of the facts proven at the trial as would have been accorded to him had he been tried and convicted of the crime of brigandage.<br\/><br\/>The records\u00a0 of criminal cases submitted to this court so frequently disclose a lack of all effort to develop the motive for the commission of the crime charged, that we take advantage of this opportunity to direct the attention of all prosecuting officers, and especially of provincial\u00a0 fiscals, to the importance\u00a0 of definitely ascertaining and proving when possible the motives which actuated the commission of a crime under judicial investigation.\u00a0 It is true that it is not indispensable to conviction for murder that the particular motive for taking the life of a human being shall be established at the trial, and that in general when the commission of a crime is clearly proven conviction\u00a0 may and should follow even where the\u00a0 reason for its commission is unknown\u00a0 (151\u00a0 U. S., 396) ; but in\u00a0 many criminal cases\u00a0 one of the\u00a0 most important aids in completing the proof of\u00a0 the commission of the crime by the accused is\u00a0 the introduction of evidence disclosing the motive which tempted the mind to indulge the criminal act; and in nearly every case wherein the law places\u00a0 the penalty to\u00a0 be imposed in the\u00a0 discretion of the\u00a0 courts within certain limits, it will\u00a0 be\u00a0 found that a knowledge of the motive which actuated the guilty person is of the greatest service in the exercise of this discretion.<br\/><br\/>Modified by substituting the penalty of life imprisonment for that of death, the judgment of conviction and the sentence imposed by the trial court should be and are hereby affirmed, with\u00a0 the\u00a0 costs of this instance\u00a0 against the\u00a0 appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano,\u00a0 C.\u00a0 J., Torres,\u00a0 Mapa,\u00a0 Johnson, Moreland,<\/i>\u00a0 and <i>Elliott, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><\/div>",

He continued in their employ until the 21st day of May, 1906.\u00a0 During all that time he was the manager of various stores belonging to the defendants in Calbayog,\u00a0 Tacloban, and Jolo and for a short time was\u00a0 employed in the main house\u00a0 in Manila.\u00a0 So far as\u00a0 appears in the evidence, the only occupation\u00a0 in which the plaintiff engaged while in the\u00a0 service of\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendants was that\u00a0 of manager of one or the other of their stores referred\u00a0 to.\u00a0 It does not appear except\u00a0 rarely that he worked as\u00a0 a clerk or\u00a0 performed any manual labor whatever, unless the performance of his duties as manager may be held to be such.\u00a0 As\u00a0 shown by the evidence,\u00a0 his work\u00a0 was\u00a0 to a very\u00a0 large\u00a0 extent management.\u00a0\u00a0 We can not assume, for the purpose of bringing the plaintiff within the statute, that he contracted to do\u00a0 prohibited work or that he worked as a laborer while here.\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Gay. 80 Fed. Rep., 254.)<br\/><br\/>During such employment the plaintiff received from the defendants the\u00a0 sum of Pl,208.76.<br\/><br\/>After\u00a0 the term mentioned in the contract had\u00a0 expired, the plaintiff\u00a0 discovered,\u00a0 as he believed, that the contract under\u00a0 which he came to the Philippine Islands was void under the laws of the United States prohibiting the importation of alien labor, and\u00a0 thereupon brought this action to recover the value of his services, disregarding entirely the said contract and the\u00a0 terms thereof and asserting his right to recover on a <i>quantum meruit.<\/i><br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 defendants set up as\u00a0 their first defense that even though said contract was void, as in violation of said laws of Congress,\u00a0 still it is valid and binding upon the parties thereto for the reason that it has been fully executed by them.\u00a0 As a second defense they allege that some time prior to the\u00a0 commencement of this action\u00a0 they and the plaintiff made a full and complete settlement of their respective accounts and claims under said contract, observing strictly the terms thereof, and that it was found upon such settlement that there was due from the plaintiff to the defendants the sum of ^528.38, for which sum the plaintiff then and there gave his\u00a0 promissory note.\u00a0\u00a0 They ask an affirmative judgment against the plaintiff for that amount.<br\/><br\/>As to the first defense, the plaintiff replied and asserted that the contract was absolutely void, it being clearly within the\u00a0 prohibition of the laws of Congress\u00a0 relating to the importation of alien labor and it could not, therefore, be an executed\u00a0 contract in the sense asserted by the defendants in their first defense.\u00a0\u00a0 As to the second defense, the plaintiff admits the execution and\u00a0 delivery of the note, but alleges that the same was voidable because it\u00a0 had been\u00a0 executed by him while under duress caused by threats on the part of the defendants.<br\/><br\/>The court below in his decision found that the contract was void\u00a0 as claimed by the plaintiff, that the note given\u00a0 in pursuance of said settlement was made and executed by the plaintiff through excessive and controlling fear caused by the threats of the defendants to put him in state prison for a series of years, and that,\u00a0 for that reason, the execution of said note occurred while plaintiff\u00a0 was\u00a0 laboring under such fear and intimidation that he did not act of his own free will.\u00a0\u00a0 Approving plaintiff's claim of a right to recover upon a <i>quantum meruit,<\/i> the court below disregarded the said contract wholly and gave the plaintiff a judgment for Pl,208.86, and interest at 6 per cent from June 1, 1906.<br\/><br\/>This case does not fall within the provisions of the Act of Congress of March 3, 1903, but within the Acts hereinafter quoted.\u00a0 (Fornow <i>vs<\/i>.

Rep., 795, 798): 'The motives and history of the Act\u00a0 are matters of\u00a0 common knowledge.\u00a0\u00a0 It had become the\u00a0 practice for large capitalists in this country to contract with their agents abroad for the shipment of great numbers of an ignorant and servile class of foreign laborers, under contracts, by which\u00a0 the employer agreed, upon the one hand, to prepay their passage, while, upon the other hand, the laborers agreed to work after their arrival for a certain\u00a0 time at a low rate of wages.\u00a0 The effect of this was to break down the labor market, and to reduce other laborers engaged in\u00a0 like occupations to the level of the assisted immigrant.\u00a0 The evil finally became so flagrant that an appeal was made to Congress for relief by the passage of the\u00a0 Act in question, the design\u00a0 of which was to raise the standard of\u00a0 foreign immigrants, and to discountenance the migration\u00a0 of those who had not sufficient means in their own hands, or those of their friends, to pay their passage.'<br\/><br\/>\"It appears, also, from the petitions, and in the testimony presented before the committees of Congress, that it was this cheap unskilled labor which was making the trouble, and\u00a0 the influx of which\u00a0 Congress sought to prevent.\u00a0 It was never suggested that we had in this country a surplus of brain toilers, and, least of all, that the market for the services of Christian ministers was depressed by foreign competition. Those were\u00a0 matters\u00a0 to\u00a0 which the attention of Congress, or of the people, was not\u00a0 directed.\u00a0\u00a0 So far, then, as the evil which was sought to be remedied interprets the statute, it also\u00a0 guides to\u00a0 an exclusion of this contract from the penalties of\u00a0 the Act.<br\/><center><br\/>*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*<br\/><\/center> <br\/>\"We find, therefore,\u00a0 that the title of the Act, the evil which was intended to be\u00a0 remedied, the circumstances surrounding the\u00a0 appeal to Congress, the reports of the committee\u00a0 of each House,\u00a0 all\u00a0 concur in affirming\u00a0 that the intent of\u00a0 Congress was simply to\u00a0 stay the influx of this cheap\u00a0 unskilled labor.\"<\/blockquote>In the case of the United States <i>vs. <\/i>Laws\u00a0 (163 U. S., 258), the\u00a0 court cites and approves\u00a0 the doctrine laid down in the above case, and in speaking of the\u00a0 opinion written in that case says, at page 264:<br\/><blockquote>\"Upon the basis, therefore, that it could not be imputed as the intention of Congress, notwithstanding the language used in the Act, to prevent the introduction of religious teachers, it was held that the Act did not apply to the case before the court.\u00a0\u00a0 Both grounds were covered in the opinion; the one that the\u00a0 Act was\u00a0 clearly intended\u00a0 to\u00a0 apply only to cheap, unskilled\u00a0 labor, and\u00a0 the\u00a0 other that\u00a0 in no event could it be construed as applying\u00a0 to a contract for the services of a rector or a pastor of a religious corporation.\u00a0\u00a0 The first ground covers the case in hand.\u00a0\u00a0 The construction given to the words 'labor or service' by this court in the above case was neither forced, unnatural, nor unusual. Considering the clear purpose of the Act, the construction adopted was a natural and proper one.\"<\/blockquote>To quote further from the opinion\u00a0 in this case,\u00a0 pages 264 and 265:<br\/><blockquote>\"In Aikin <i>vs<\/i>. Wasson (24 N. Y., 482)\u00a0 the plaintiff contracted with a railroad company to\u00a0 construct part\u00a0 of its road.\u00a0 Defendant was a stockholder in the company, which became insolvent.\u00a0 It\u00a0 was indebted\u00a0 to\u00a0 plaintiff for the services of himself and his laborers and servants\u00a0 under his contract.\u00a0 Section 10 of the Railroad Act enacted that 'all the stockholders of every such company shall be jointly and severally liable for all the debts due or owing to any of its\u00a0 laborers and servants for services\u00a0 performed for such corporation.'\u00a0\u00a0 It was held that the plaintiff was neither a laborer nor a servant within the meaning of the Act.<br\/><br\/>\"In Coffin <i>vs. <\/i>Reynolds\u00a0 (37 N. Y., 640) the statute reads: 'The stockholders of a company organized under the provisions of this Act shall be jointly\u00a0 and\u00a0 severally individually liable for all debts that may be due and owing to all their laborers, servants, and apprentices for services performed for such corporation.'\u00a0 The plaintiff\u00a0 was the secretary of the company and commenced an action against the defendant as a stockholder to recover the amount\u00a0 of his salary, the company being insolvent.\u00a0 It was\u00a0 held that he could not recover.\u00a0 He was not a\u00a0 laborer or a servant within the meaning of the statute.<br\/><br\/>\"In Wakefield <i>vs. <\/i>Fargo (90 N. Y.,\u00a0 213), under the same statute, it was held that one who\u00a0 was employed at a yearly salary\u00a0 as bookkeeper and general manager was not\u00a0 a laborer, servant, or apprentice within the meaning of the Act, and hence that he could not recover against the stockholders for a balance of salary due him from the insolvent corporation.<br\/><br\/>\"These\u00a0 statutes were\u00a0 passed\u00a0 for the protection\u00a0 of\u00a0 laborers, servants, apprentices, and the like, and the opinions of the courts in relation to the class of individuals that would be included within the meaning of those terms are somewhat relevant, although not entirely analogous, to the case before this court.\"<\/blockquote>It thus\u00a0 appears that the\u00a0 Supreme Court\u00a0 of\u00a0 the United States has decided clearly and definitely that the only\u00a0 laborers to which the Act in question refers are those engaged in <i>cheap, unskilled<\/i> labor.<br\/><br\/>In the case of the\u00a0 United States <i>vs.<\/i> Gay (80 Fed.

He is chosen for his knowledge and not for his muscular capacity,\u00a0 in which latter quality he may or may not be eminent.\"<\/blockquote>In\u00a0 the case of Trust Company <i>vs.<\/i> Grand Rapids Democrat\u00a0 (113 Mich., 615)\u00a0 the question of the right of preference arose under a statute reading as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"The funds which shall be owed for labor by any person, persons, or corporation at\u00a0 the\u00a0 time he, they, or it shall become insolvent, shall be\u00a0 preferred claims, etc.\"<\/blockquote>The nature of the work performed by the person claiming preference\u00a0 \"was the writing of editorials and the performing of various kinds of editorial work required\u00a0 to be done\u00a0 on the daily and weekly issues of the Grand Rapids Democrat,\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 the\u00a0 preparation\u00a0 and correction\u00a0 of copy\u00a0 for the printers,\u00a0 the direction\u00a0 of the make-up of the paper, including full charge of all branches of the mechanical department of said paper after the close of the business office\u00a0 each night.\"\u00a0 Another claim for preference was presented by\u00a0 one who was engaged in \"proof reading and traveling\u00a0 around the city gathering news,\"\u00a0 Another claim for preference was presented\u00a0 by one\u00a0 who was engaged \"in reporting, going around to\u00a0 the different wholesale houses, collecting\u00a0 market reports and assisting in\u00a0 editorial\u00a0 work and proof reading.\"\u00a0 In deciding the case the court said, in regard\u00a0 to these\u00a0 two claimants,\u00a0 \"it was the work\u00a0 of professional men rather than\u00a0 the work\u00a0 of laborers, giving the word\u00a0 its ordinary acceptation, and is not such work as is intended to be covered by the statute.\"<br\/><br\/>In the case of Wildner <i>vs.<\/i> Ferguson\u00a0 (42\u00a0 Minn., 112) it was held, interpreting a statute providing for the exemption of wages,\u00a0 that\u00a0 the words \"a laboring man\u00a0 or woman\" did not include and protect an agent\u00a0 who sells goods by sample, driving about for that purpose with his own horse and buggy and receiving a weekly salary.<br\/><br\/>In the case of Wakefield <i>vs.<\/i> Fargo (90 N. Y., 213), the question before the court was the interpretation of the meaning of the words \"laborers, servants, and apprentices\" in a statute making stockholders \"liable for all debts that may be due and owed to their laborers, servants, and apprentices for services performed for such corporation.\"\u00a0\u00a0 It was held in that case that one employed at a yearly\u00a0 salary as a bookkeeper and general manager is not a laborer,\u00a0 servant, or apprentice within the meaning of the provision of law just quoted.\u00a0 In that case the person\u00a0 seeking\u00a0 the favor of the statute \"kept account of the receipts and\u00a0 disbursements of the company, and in the absence of the\u00a0 superintendent had the charge and control of its business.\"<br\/><br\/>In the case of Aiken <i>vs.<\/i> Wasson (24\u00a0 N. Y., 482), the person seeking the favor of a\u00a0 statute similar to the one in the case last cited was \"a contractor with the Albany\u00a0 and Northern\u00a0 Railroad Company,\u00a0 of which\u00a0 the defendant is a stockholder, for the construction of a part of its road.\"\u00a0 The court said\u00a0 (p. 483) :<br\/><blockquote>\"It is obvious from the nature and terms of this and other provisions\u00a0 of the Act, as well as from\u00a0 the general policy indicated by analogous statutes, that the legislature intended to throw a special protection around that class of persons who should actually perform the manual labor\u00a0 of\u00a0 the company.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It was held that such contractor was not a laborer within the meaning of the Act.\u00a0\u00a0 To the same effect are Balch <i>vs.<\/i> Railroad Co. (46 N. Y., 521); Ericsson<i> vs. <\/i>Brown (38 Barb. (N. Y.), 390); Stryker <i>vs<\/i>. Cassidy\u00a0 (10\u00a0 Hun.\u00a0 (N.

Leuffer (84 Pa.\u00a0 St., 168), the court said (p. 171):<br\/><blockquote>\"When we speak of the laboring or working classes, we certainly do not intend to include therein persons like civil engineers, the\u00a0 value of whose services rests rather in their scientific than\u00a0 in their physical ability.\u00a0\u00a0 We thereby intend those who\u00a0 are engaged not in\u00a0 head but\u00a0 in hand work and who depend upon such hand work for their\u00a0 living.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>To the\u00a0 same effect are Heebner <i>vs<\/i>.\u00a0 Chave\u00a0 (5\u00a0 Pa.\u00a0 St., 117); Seider's Appeal (46 Pa.

Y.), 463).<br\/><br\/>In State <i>vs<\/i>. Rusk (55 Wis., 465) it was said that the word \"laborer,\" as employed in the Act empowering the governor to expend certain moneys in paying the claims of laborers, etc.,\u00a0 for work on a line of railway,\u00a0 should be interpreted in the sense in which it is ordinarily used and understood when applied to men engaged in constructing railways.\u00a0 It was held that engineers were not included.<br\/><br\/>The court in the case of Bank <i> vs.<\/i> Shenandoah Iron Co. (35\u00a0 Fed.\u00a0 Rep., 436), interpreting\u00a0 a statute\u00a0 of Virginia giving the wages of employees of an insolvent corporation preference, held that the president of an\u00a0 iron manufacturing company, whose official designation was \"general manager,\" was not entitled to the\u00a0 preference provided by\u00a0 said statute.\u00a0 See England <i>vs.<\/i> Organ Co. (41 N. J. Eq., 470).<br\/><br\/>In Kyle <i>vs<\/i>. Montgomery\u00a0 (73\u00a0 Ga., 343), the court\u00a0 held that the \"boss\" of a department of a factory, having charge of the employment and discharge of the\u00a0 men who worked under him, who was required to\u00a0 do no manual labor, but was\u00a0 simply required\u00a0 to exercise his experience and knowledge in the direction of the operatives, can not be regarded as a\u00a0 day\u00a0 laborer within the\u00a0 meaning and\u00a0 intent of the statute exempting the wages of such persons from garnishment.\u00a0\u00a0 (18 L. R. A., 309.)<br\/><br\/>There\u00a0 are many cases holding,\u00a0 in\u00a0 some respects, apparently conflicting doctrines.\u00a0 For example:<br\/><br\/>In the case of Heckman <i>vs<\/i>. Tammen\u00a0 (184 I11., 144) a bookkeeper was held to be\u00a0 a laborer within a statute\u00a0 preferring the laborers of an insolvent employer.<br\/><br\/>The following cases have held that a clerk is a laborer: Cole <i>vs.<\/i> McNeill (99 Ga., 250); Railroad Go.<i> vs.<\/i> Baker\u00a0 (14 Kans., 428) ; Signor <i>vs.<\/i>\u00a0 Webb\u00a0 (44 111.\u00a0 App.,\u00a0 338); Epps <i>vs<\/i>. Epps (17 111. App., 196).<br\/><br\/>In the case of Heckman <i>vs<\/i>. Tammen (184 111., 144), construing an Act entitled \"An Act to protect employees and laborers in their claims for wages,\" in\u00a0 which it was provided that \"in all such cases the debts owed to laborers or servants, which have accrued by reason of their labor or employment, shall be considered and treated as preferred claims,\u00a0 and such laborers or employees\u00a0 shall be preferred creditors,\" it was held that the parties claiming the favor of the\u00a0 statute\u00a0 performed \"physical labor as typesetters, cylinder feeders, pressmen,\u00a0 and one\u00a0 also kept the books, at stipulated wages of so much per week.\u00a0 That\u00a0 in their employment they had\u00a0 acquired\u00a0 and used skill would\u00a0 not render the designation 'laborer' inapplicable.\u00a0 They labored with their hands for their employer for wages and were clearly laborers within the meaning of the statute.\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 * While\u00a0 we are disposed to\u00a0 hold\u00a0 that the\u00a0 statute must be confined to those who perform\u00a0 manual service, still it\u00a0 can not be confined to such services only that require\u00a0 no skill in their performance of them.\"<br\/><br\/>In the case of Lawton <i>vs.<\/i> Richardson (118\u00a0 Mich., 669), the court, interpreting a statute which\u00a0 gave a preference to debts for labor,\u00a0 held that debts due to employees in a dry-goods store, who act as department managers and salesmen, and perform such services as the unpacking of goods, marking them\u00a0 and placing them\u00a0 upon shelves, sweeping out the store, and\u00a0 keeping\u00a0 the\u00a0 stock in order,\u00a0 are debts for labor\u00a0 within the meaning of\u00a0 the statute.\u00a0 The court said (p. 671):<br\/><blockquote>\"The circuit\u00a0 judge found that, as to\u00a0 the work\u00a0 done\u00a0 by Mr. Lawton when in New York,\u00a0 it was not the work of a laborer within the meaning of the statute; but as to the other work done by him, and the work\u00a0 done by the other complainants,\u00a0 it\u00a0 was labor\u00a0 within the meaning of\u00a0 the statute.\u00a0 It\u00a0 is apparent from what has already appeared that nearly\u00a0 all\u00a0 the\u00a0 labor done was not\u00a0 intellectual or\u00a0 supervisional [professional] in its character, nor\u00a0 was it\u00a0 of an especially skillful kind.\u00a0 It was, in\u00a0 the main, manual labor and\u00a0 of such a character as the statute was intended to protect.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The following cases have held foremen to be laborers: Flagstaff Silver Mining\u00a0 Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Cullins\u00a0 (104\u00a0 U.\u00a0 S., 176) ; Capron <i>vs.<\/i> Strout (11 Nev., 304); Kyle <i>vs<\/i>.\u00a0 Montgomery (73 Ga., 337).<br\/><br\/>The following cases have held a\u00a0 superintendent to be a\u00a0 laborer: Gold\u00a0 Mining\u00a0 Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Bouscher\u00a0 (9 Col., 385); Coraker <i>vs.<\/i>\u00a0 Mathews (25\u00a0 Ga., 571);\u00a0 Moore\u00a0 <i>vs.<\/i>\u00a0 Heaney (14 Md., 559); Pendergast<i> vs<\/i>. Yandes (124 Ind., 159).<br\/><br\/>In the\u00a0 case of\u00a0 Williams <i>vs. <\/i>Link (64 Miss.,\u00a0 641), the court said (p. 643):<br\/><blockquote>\"Where\u00a0 physical toil is the main ingredient of services rendered,\u00a0 although directed and made\u00a0 more valuable by skill, the person performing them is a laborer within the meaning of the statute.\u00a0 The appellant is shown by the record to\u00a0 have\u00a0 been a laborer, engaged as a clerk in\u00a0 a store, and the wages earned by him as such\u00a0 laborer are exempt from garnishment.\"\u00a0<br\/><\/blockquote>In the case of the Flagstaff Silver Mining Co.<i> vs. <\/i>Culling, <i>supra,<\/i> the\u00a0 court said (p.\u00a0 177):<br\/><blockquote>\"Statutes giving liens to laborers and mechanics for their work and labor are to be liberally construed.\u00a0 (Davis <i>vs.<\/i> Alvord, 94 U. S., 545.)\u00a0 The\u00a0 finding of the\u00a0 district court makes clear the character of the\u00a0 services\u00a0 rendered by the defendant in\u00a0 error.\u00a0 He was not the general agent of the mining business\u00a0 of\u00a0 the plaintiff in error.\u00a0 That office was\u00a0 filled\u00a0 by\u00a0 Patrick.\u00a0 He was\u00a0 not a contractor. His\u00a0 services were not of a professional character, such as those of a mining engineer.\u00a0 He was the overseer and foreman of the body of miners who performed\u00a0 manual labor upon the mine.\u00a0 He\u00a0 planned\u00a0 and\u00a0 personally\u00a0 superintended and directed the work, with a view to develop the mine and make it a successful venture.\u00a0\u00a0 His duties were similar to\u00a0 those\u00a0 of the foreman of\u00a0 a gang of track hands upon a railroad,\u00a0 or\u00a0 of a force of\u00a0 mechanics engaged in building\u00a0 a house.\u00a0\u00a0 Such\u00a0 duties\u00a0 are\u00a0 very different\u00a0 from those\u00a0 which\u00a0 belong to the general\u00a0 superintendent\u00a0 of a railroad\u00a0 or the\u00a0 contractor\u00a0 for\u00a0 erecting\u00a0 a house.\u00a0 Their performance may well be called work and labor;\u00a0 they\u00a0 require the personal attention and supervision\u00a0 of the\u00a0 foreman, and occasionally in an emergency, or for an example, it becomes necessary for him to assist with his own hands. They can not be performed without much physical exertion, which, while not so severe as that demanded of the workmen under his control, is nevertheless as really work and labor.\u00a0\u00a0 Bodily toil, as well as some skill and knowledge in directing the\u00a0 work,\u00a0 is required for\u00a0 their successful performance. We think that the discharge of them may well be called\u00a0 work and labor, and that the district court rightfully declared the\u00a0 person who\u00a0 performed them\u00a0 entitled to a lien under the law of the Territory.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The reasons for this apparent conflict are\u00a0 found, not, perhaps, so much in the different ways in which different courts regard\u00a0 the\u00a0 general subject, as in the wording\u00a0 of the\u00a0 particular statutes under consideration,\u00a0 and\u00a0 in the fact that one who is called, for\u00a0 example, a clerk in one jurisdiction and performs therein a class\u00a0 of service which entitles him to that designation, will still\u00a0 be called a\u00a0 clerk in another jurisdiction, although he performs\u00a0 different\u00a0 or additional services.\u00a0\u00a0 In other words,\u00a0 while his services\u00a0 in the former jurisdiction are purely those of a clerk, in the other they are a mixture of those of clerk and superintendent, or overseer or bookkeeper, or traveling salesman. This is a source\u00a0 of considerable\u00a0 confusion to\u00a0 one\u00a0 reading the decision hastily.<br\/><br\/>Moreover, in viewing the apparent\u00a0 discordance between the holdings of many of the courts above cited and those of Holy Trinity Church vs. United States and United States vs.\u00a0 Laws,\u00a0 <i>supra<\/i>,\u00a0 we must not overlook the fact that the rules of statutory\u00a0 construction and\u00a0 interpretation applicable to the statute under consideration in the case at bar are directly opposite\u00a0 to\u00a0 those applicable to the statutes interpreted and construed\u00a0 in the other cases.\u00a0\u00a0 The statute now under consideration, being highly penal, must be construed with extreme strictness; while\u00a0 the statutes dealt with in the other cases,\u00a0 having for their object the giving of liens\u00a0 \"to laborers and mechanic's for their work and labor,\" are to be liberally construed.<br\/><br\/>The courts are,\u00a0 however, substantially uniform in holding that, where the nature of the employment is essentially of superintendence or\u00a0 management, he who\u00a0 engages\u00a0 in that employment\u00a0 is not a laborer\u00a0 but\u00a0 a superintendent or manager\u00a0 and is not\u00a0 within the letter or the spirit\u00a0 of the Act.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court\u00a0 below is hereby reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial, without special finding as to the costs of this instance.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i> Arellano, C.

He promised that if he should be elected to that office his\u00a0 electors would not be employed in any work for the town, and that if they\u00a0 ever\u00a0 became involved in any court proceedings or with the\u00a0 government,\u00a0 they would be assisted\u00a0 by him,\u00a0 the expenses\u00a0 to be paid out of the funds\u00a0 of the\u00a0 group;\u00a0 that one of the agreements made by the group was to distribute ballots among the electors bearing the names of the\u00a0 persons to be voted for, prior to\u00a0 the former taking the oath\u00a0 prescribed\u00a0 by law; the said\u00a0 electors were instructed\u00a0 to elect no other persons than such as were designated in the\u00a0 ballots; that Silvestre Arzadon held meetings for the purpose\u00a0 of influencing and inducing the electors to vote for certain persons\u00a0 and\u00a0 offered\u00a0 money\u00a0 wherever necessary\u00a0 or\u00a0 to the electors who\u00a0 did not desire employment, etc.,\u00a0 etc.<br\/><br\/>\"By the foregoing, Silvestre Arzadon appears\u00a0 to have violated the provisions of\u00a0 the\u00a0 Election Law which prohibit every action, influence, and promise of\u00a0 any kind, for the purpose\u00a0 of obtaining\u00a0 votes.\u00a0\u00a0 These should indicate\u00a0 the free\u00a0 will of the voters, and for such\u00a0 infractions his\u00a0 election\u00a0 for the office of\u00a0 municipal president of\u00a0 the\u00a0 town of Badoc must\u00a0 be\u00a0 considered illegal.<br\/><br\/>\"Therefore, it is decreed by the court that\u00a0 the election of\u00a0 Silvestre\u00a0 Arzadon for the office of\u00a0 president,\u00a0 held on the 5th day\u00a0 of\u00a0 November last, in the municipality\u00a0 of Badoc, Ilocos Norte,\u00a0 was\u00a0 not legal, and\u00a0 another special election\u00a0 for the said office\u00a0 must be held at the expense\u00a0 of the said Arzadon who shall not then\u00a0 be eligible, and any vote\u00a0 entered in\u00a0 his favor\u00a0 shall not count; the\u00a0 costs and expenses of these proceedings shall also be charged to him.\"<\/blockquote>Upon\u00a0 being notified of the above decision, Silvestre Arzadon\u00a0 appeared before\u00a0 this\u00a0 court\u00a0 and\u00a0 instituted, certiorari proceedings and prayed that said decision\u00a0 be declared null in so far as it\u00a0 held that he was ineligible for the special election\u00a0 for the\u00a0 office of municipal president of the\u00a0 town of Badoc,\u00a0 as ordered in\u00a0 said\u00a0 judgment, and\u00a0 so\u00a0 far\u00a0 as\u00a0 it provides that said\u00a0 special election be held at his expense. The matter has now been submitted to this court.<br\/><br\/>Certiorari is\u00a0 the proper remedy whenever\u00a0 an inferior tribunal, board, or\u00a0 officer exercising judicial functions, has exceeded its or his jurisdiction,\u00a0 and no appeal,\u00a0 nor\u00a0 any plain, speedy, and\u00a0 adequate remedy exists to correct such excess or\u00a0 extralimitation.\u00a0 (Sees. 217 and 514,\u00a0 Code of Civil\u00a0 Procedure.)\u00a0\u00a0 The jurisdiction of Courts of First Instance to hear and\u00a0 decide election contests\u00a0 is exclusive and final\u00a0 (sec.\u00a0 27 of the\u00a0 Election\u00a0 Law) ; consequently,\u00a0 decisions rendered by them in the exercise of said jurisdiction can not be reviewed by means of an appeal.\u00a0 As they are not appealable and as against them no other plain, speedy and adequate\u00a0 remedy exists,\u00a0 it is evident that they constitute a proper\u00a0 subject for the extraordinary remedy of certiorari.\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, if the court below has exceeded his jurisdiction in\u00a0 rendering the\u00a0 above-cited\u00a0 decision it is proper to annul the\u00a0 same by\u00a0 virtue of said proceedings.<br\/><br\/>It is our opinion that\u00a0 he has so exceeded his jurisdiction.\u00a0 The\u00a0 jurisdiction of Courts of First Instance to hear election protests\u00a0 is conferred\u00a0 upon them by the\u00a0 aforesaid\u00a0\u00a0 section 27 of the Election\u00a0 Law, and neither the said section, nor any other legal provision authorizes the court, in deciding such protests, to declare ineligible in future elections the person against whom the protest was presented, nor to sentence him to pay the expenses of the new election to be held.\u00a0\u00a0 Hence, the court below had no power to enter such rulings in the case as gave rise to these proceedings, and\u00a0 in consequence\u00a0 thereof said rulings must be entirely annulled.<br\/><br\/>The said court having ordered a special election,\u00a0 it is a question whether or not he was authorized to do so under the Election Law.\u00a0 But this\u00a0 point\u00a0 in his\u00a0 decision has\u00a0 not been\u00a0 impugned nor\u00a0 appealed from, and can\u00a0 not therefore be the subject of a ruling in\u00a0 this decision.<br\/><br\/>The judgment\u00a0 appealed\u00a0 from is hereby annulled\u00a0 in\u00a0 so far as it holds that the petitioner is ineligible at\u00a0 the special election ordered therein, and imposes\u00a0 on him the obligation to bear the expenses of such election, without any special ruling as to the costs in these proceedings.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i> Arellano, C.

Ramos brought suit in the Court of\u00a0 First Instance of Occidental Negros,\u00a0 alleging in his complaint, among other things, the following: That on the 13th of the previous month of .May, Martin Grosin, as deputy\u00a0 sheriff of the province, Manuel\u00a0 Lopez,\u00a0 on petition of the firm known as The Sons of I. de la Rama, proceeded to attach\u00a0 20 carabaos, consisting of 10 castrated carabaos, 7 female carabaos, and 3 calves, belonging to the plaintiff, which\u00a0 attachment was not set aside, notwithstanding the protest made by their owner\u00a0 who had\u00a0 already planted in seed beds 100 cavanes of rice\u00a0 required for 100 hectares of land which, without the use of the attached carabaos, would not be set out and the plaintiff would thereby be damaged to the extent of P5,000, wherefore he asked that judgment be rendered against\u00a0 the defendants\u00a0 directing them to return to the plaintiff the said 20 carabaos thus attached, and condemning them to\u00a0 the payment of P5,000 as damages, in addition to the costs of\u00a0 the trial\u00a0 and the imposition of the other penalties expressed\u00a0 in the complaint.<br\/><br\/>The defendants having been summoned, Valentin Inventor in his answer stated that he admitted the facts\u00a0 alleged in the complaint and asked that the case be dismissed.<br\/><br\/>By order\u00a0 of the court\u00a0 of August\u00a0 16, issued on\u00a0 petition of the\u00a0 plaintiff, the defendant Manuel Lopez was declared in default.<br\/><br\/>The other defendants, the firm of The Sons of I. de la Rama and Martin Grosin, in answer to the complaint, set forth that they denied each and all of the allegations contained in each and all of the paragraphs of the complaint, with the exception of those in paragraph 1 of the same; and as a special defense\u00a0 they alleged\u00a0 that the\u00a0 carabaos claimed belonged to the defendant Valentin Inventor; that the pretended right of ownership of the plaintiff Ramos is based on\u00a0 an alleged public document of\u00a0 transfer said to have been executed by the\u00a0 defendant Inventor in favor of the said\u00a0 plaintiff Ramos on the 14th of September, 1906; that the said transfer was a sham, contrary to law, and made with the\u00a0 intent to defraud the\u00a0 said firm, the creditor of the said Inventor; wherefore they prayed that the complaint be dismissed, with the costs against the\u00a0 plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>By written motion of November 11,\u00a0 1907, the plaintiff asked permission to\u00a0 amend paragraph 3 of the\u00a0 complaint so that it would read: \"that he duly protested against the said attachment, and presented the corresponding document of intervention to the defendants, Martin Grosin and Manuel Lopez, notwithstanding which intervention the attachment has not been raised.\"<br\/><br\/>On January 24, 1908, the case was heard and the evidence was adduced by both parties, the documents exhibited being attached to the record, and the court, on May 8 of the same year, rendered judgment in the case, declaring null and void the instrument of September 14, 1906,\u00a0 Exhibit No. 1, executed by\u00a0 Valentin\u00a0 Inventor\u00a0 evidencing the\u00a0 sale\u00a0 of\u00a0 the carabaos in question to Rafael 0.\u00a0 Ramos, as the sale was contrary to law,\u00a0 and\u00a0 that the said\u00a0 stock must\u00a0 therefore be considered\u00a0 as\u00a0 belonging to Valentin Inventor, and discharged all the defendants, without express finding as to the costs.\u00a0 To this decision the plaintiff\u00a0 filed exception and\u00a0 by petition\u00a0 of May\u00a0 12,\u00a0 1908, requested a\u00a0 new trial on\u00a0 the grounds\u00a0 that the judgment was contrary to law and that the findings of fact therein set forth were manifestly contrary to the weight\u00a0 of the evidence.\u00a0\u00a0 This petition was denied and\u00a0 exception\u00a0 thereto\u00a0 was taken\u00a0 by the plaintiff, who\u00a0 duly presented the corresponding bill of exceptions which was approved, certified,\u00a0 and forwarded to this court, together with the record of the evidence taken at the trial.<br\/><br\/>This litigation concerns a claim made by Rafael 0. Ramos, as intervener,\u00a0 for the return to him\u00a0 of 20 carabaos which were attached on\u00a0 petition of the firm of The Sons of I,\u00a0 de la Rama, which claim is based on the alleged fact that he is the owner of these animals and that\u00a0 they no longer belong to Valentin Inventor, the debtor of the said firm.<br\/><br\/>It not being shown in the record that when Valentin Inventor transferred the said carabaos to the intervener Ramos, for a\u00a0 consideration,\u00a0 there existed against\u00a0 the\u00a0 said Valentin any condemnatory judgment or that any writ\u00a0 of attachment of his property had been issued, it is not permissible to presume the said contract of sale to have been executed in fraud of the said creditor firm, under the provisions of article 1297 of the Civil Code.<br\/><br\/>Upon the supposition that the carabaos in question were really sold by their owner on September 14, 1906, as stated in the notarial\u00a0 certificate,\u00a0 Exhibit\u00a0 1 of the plaintiff, the provisions of the Civil Code would not apply to the contract of sale, inasmuch as contracts of purchase and sale and of transfer of large cattle\u00a0 are governed and\u00a0 regulated by special laws in force in these Islands,\u00a0 and only in case of a deficiency in the latter would the\u00a0 provisions of the Civil Code be applied, as prescribed by article 16 of the said code.<br\/><br\/>Act No. 1147 provides,\u00a0 in\u00a0 section\u00a0 13,\u00a0 that municipal treasurers shall enter in a book, duly prepared and kept for the purpose, all transfers of large cattle,\u00a0 which entry shall set forth\u00a0 the\u00a0 name and residence of the owner, the name and residence of the purchaser,\u00a0 the purchase price of the animal or the consideration for the sale, the class, sex, age, brands, and\u00a0 other\u00a0 marks\u00a0 of identification of the animal, and a reference\u00a0 by number to\u00a0 the original\u00a0 certificate of ownership, with the name of the municipality which issued it.<br\/><br\/>Section 14 provides that on making the entry of transfer prescribed by\u00a0 the preceding section, the municipal treasurer shall issue to\u00a0 the purchaser of the.\u00a0 animal a certificate of transfer expressing the details set forth in the said article, etc.<br\/><br\/>Section 22 of the said Act provides that:<br\/><blockquote>\"No transfer\u00a0 of large\u00a0 cattle shall\u00a0 be\u00a0 valid\u00a0 unless\u00a0 registered and a\u00a0 certificate of transfer secured as herein provided.\"<\/blockquote>The certificate, Exhibit E, issued by the deputy treasurer of the pueblo\u00a0 of Hog, Occidental\u00a0 Negros,\u00a0 shows that in the registry books of transfer of large cattle on file in his office, there is no entry whatever of the transfer of large cattle by Valentin Inventor to the plaintiff Rafael 0.\u00a0 Ramos.<br\/><br\/>So that, in the sale\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 20 carabaos attached, with others, as set forth in the notarial document above referred to,\u00a0 the said special law, Act No. 1147, was violated.\u00a0 This law clearly and\u00a0 expressly requires\u00a0 the registration of all transfers of large cattle made in these Islands, and to this effect section 22 declares that no transfer of large cattle shall be valid without the registration and the issuance of the certificate mentioned in the said sections 13 and 14.<br\/><br\/>Article 4 of the\u00a0 Civil Code declares that \"Acts executed against the provisions of law are void, excepting the cases in which said law orders their validity.\"<br\/><br\/>The special law to which the alleged contract of purchase and sale of the 20\u00a0 carabaos concerned is subject, provides, as already shown, that no transfer of large cattle shall be valid that has not\u00a0 been registered and\u00a0 certified to by the municipal official charged with keeping the books of registration of such acts and issuing the\u00a0 proper certificates.<br\/><br\/>If that which is\u00a0 not valid in law is\u00a0 entirely null and cannot\u00a0 be maintained\u00a0 before the courts, it is unquestionable that when the\u00a0 20 carabaos were attached on May 13, 1907, and which were then\u00a0 in the possession\u00a0 of\u00a0 Valentin Inventor, these animals were owned by the latter and did not belong to\u00a0 the plaintiff\u00a0 Rafael 0. Ramos,\u00a0 notwithstanding the notarial instrument of sale of the\u00a0 same issued on September 14 of the previous year; inasmuch as the said sale or transfer of carabaos, animals properly designated as large cattle, and undoubtedly comprised within the provisions of the aforesaid\u00a0 special law, was not valid and\u00a0 is therefore as void as if it had not\u00a0 been\u00a0 made, because the\u00a0 attempted sale was effected in manifest violation of the aforementioned special law, as\u00a0 the record shows that it was not registered, and no certificate could be exhibited showing the transfer of the carabaos.\u00a0 \u00a0<br\/>.<br\/>If the carabaos were\u00a0 not legally transferred by sale to the plaintiff and\u00a0 continued to belong tdv Valentin Inventor on the date of\u00a0 the attachment, notwithstanding his allegation that\u00a0 he held them by virtue of a lease agreed upon with the purchaser, it must be considered that they are his property and that they were\u00a0 duly attached on petition\u00a0 of the creditor firm of\u00a0 The Sons of I. de la Rama.\u00a0 The instrument of transfer and sale of the said carabaos, dated September 14, 1906, does not prevail against this consideration, for the reason that by that document the law is not complied with, nor are acts thereby confirmed which were not valid.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, accepting in\u00a0 part those\u00a0 contained in\u00a0 the judgment appealed\u00a0 from\u00a0 and denying\u00a0 the claim\u00a0 of intervention\u00a0 by the plaintiff with respect to\u00a0 the attached carabaos, which are the property\u00a0 of Valentin Inventor, we are of the opinion that the defendants should be and they are hereby acquitted\u00a0 of the complaint, with\u00a0 the costs against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

The only descendant\u00a0 of Luisa, Gregoria Meruegos,\u00a0 is not a party to the suit and therefore\u00a0 appears\u00a0 as\u00a0 a defendant together with\u00a0 Jacinto Lizares.<br\/><br\/>At the\u00a0 conclusion of\u00a0 the\u00a0 trial,\u00a0 Florentine's\u00a0 children, named Anatolio, Hilaria, and Felisa, having testified as witnesses for the defendant, Lizares, in opposition to the allegations of the complaint, were\u00a0 likewise therein\u00a0 included as defendants, by an amendment authorized by the court.\u00a0 So that, of the heirs of Benedicto Jumero, the descendant of one entire branch, Luisa, and three of those of another branch, that of Florentino, impugned the complaint and take no part in the claim for the restitution of the land of\u00a0 their common predecessor in interest.<br\/><br\/>The following facts are admitted: First, that all the heirs named Jumero are actually the descendants of Benedicto Jumero; second, that the\u00a0 land, which is\u00a0 the subject of the suit, passed into the possession of Jacinto\u00a0 Lizares,. for the sum of 50 pesos, about forty years before; and third, that the reason for this\u00a0 transfer was\u00a0 the fact that Nicolas Jumero, a son of Felix, was drafted for the army, and to secure His release from the military service, or to pay the attorney who was to negotiate the release, the 50 pesos were required.<br\/><br\/>The whole question involved is whether the 50 pesos were received as a mortgage loan, as the plaintiffs claim, or as the price of sale, as maintained from the beginning by the defendants, Jacinto Lizares and\u00a0 Gregoria Meruegos,\u00a0 and subsequently by Anatolio, Hilaria, and Felisa Jumero, the latter\u00a0 represented\u00a0 by her husband, Basilio Alferio.\u00a0 The plaintiffs claim that the land was delivered\u00a0 under mortgage in order that Lizares might have the usufruct until it should be redeemed through the payment of\u00a0 the\u00a0 50 pesos.\u00a0 The defendants assert that the land was sold outright to Lizares for the price of 50 pesos.<br\/><br\/>The Court of First Instance of Occidental Negros decided the case in favor of the defendants and absolved them from the complaint.\u00a0\u00a0 The plaintiffs appealed.<br\/><br\/>Having forwarded a\u00a0 bill of exceptions,\u00a0 with a right to a revision\u00a0 of the evidence, two errors are alleged in this instance against the judgment of the lower court.<br\/><br\/>First.\u00a0 For having admitted, notwithstanding the objection of\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiffs,\u00a0 the testimony\u00a0 introduced by\u00a0 the appellees relative to the purchase of the land in question by Jacinto Lizares.<br\/><br\/>Second.\u00a0 Because\u00a0 the trial judge entertained doubt\u00a0 as to the character of the contract,\u00a0 by virtue of which\u00a0 the defendant, Jacinto Lizares, possesses the land in question, and\u00a0 because,\u00a0 by reason of this\u00a0 doubt,\u00a0 he\u00a0 absolved\u00a0 the defendants, and did not declare that there was a preponderance of evidence in favor of the plaintiff appellants.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the first assignment of error, it is alleged that, as the question involves the purchase of real estate, the testimony of witnesses is not admissible, and that at the time the land in question was supposed to\u00a0 have been purchased, the laws\u00a0 of the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Partidas<\/span> were in force,\u00a0 and,\u00a0 in accordance with law 6,\u00a0 title 5, of the 5th <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Partida,<\/span> it was necessary for the validity of the contract that the sale\u00a0 be made by a public instrument.\u00a0 The law cited provides that the\u00a0 purchase\u00a0 and sale may be made in\u00a0 two ways - by a public instrument, and without one.\u00a0 The first is when the vendee says to the vendor: \"I wish that a document of sale be made.\"\u00a0 Such a sale, although the vendee and the vendor a!gree on the price, is not completed until the instrument is made and executed, because, before that is done, one or the other\u00a0 may repent.\u00a0\u00a0 The sale may be made\u00a0 without an instrument when the vendee and the vendor both agree upon the price thereof and exchange the thing for the price, without mentioning\u00a0 the instrument.<br\/><br\/>The first assignment of error is\u00a0 therefore without foundation.\u00a0 In accordance with the legislation of the Partidas, patterned after\u00a0 the Roman Law, the contract of purchase and\u00a0 sale is eminently consensual\u00a0 and, consequently, only requires consent for its perfection.\u00a0\u00a0 In order that an instrument be\u00a0 necessary, it was required that this\u00a0 form should also\u00a0 be the subject of consent and\u00a0 that the validity of the contract\u00a0 be made dependent thereon: <i>I wish a bill of sale to be made of the thing sold,<\/i> was what the vendee should say to the vendor, according to the law cited, in order that he might not be bound until\u00a0 after the execution of the instrument.<br\/><br\/>As to the second assignment of error, it is true that the trial judge\u00a0 while in doubt, and by reason of his doubt, which still\u00a0 existed after weighing the contradictory\u00a0 testimony, decided the suit\u00a0 in favor of the defendant.\u00a0 In so doing, he committed no error whatever, but, on the contrary, complied with the second paragraph\u00a0 of\u00a0 article 6 of the Civil Code, which provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"When there is no law exactly applicable to the point in controversy, the\u00a0 customs of the place shall be observed, and, in the absence thereof, the general principles of law.\"<\/blockquote>And it is a general principle of law that, in case of doubt, the condition of he who possesses is the better one.\u00a0 The defendant in whose favor the\u00a0 doubt was\u00a0 decided\u00a0 is\u00a0 the possessor.<br\/><br\/>But, in reality, it was not\u00a0 a case of doubt, neither with respect to the law nor the facts adduced by the witnesses, whose\u00a0 testimony,\u00a0 rationally\u00a0 weighed, does not show\u00a0 an evident preponderance of proof in favor of the plaintiffs, but all to the contrary.<br\/><br\/>By law, in conformity with article 448 of\u00a0 the Civil Code, this case\u00a0 could not but be decided in favor of the defendant.<br\/><blockquote>\"The possessor by virtue of ownership has in his favor the legal presumption\u00a0 that he\u00a0 holds\u00a0 possession by\u00a0 reason of\u00a0 a sufficient title and he\u00a0 can not be\u00a0 forced\u00a0 to show\u00a0 it.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The defendant, Lizares, who\u00a0 has\u00a0 possessed the land in litigation for forty years, alleges that he is in\u00a0 possession thereof by virtue of a title of purchase and sale, which is a title of transfer of ownership; he is,\u00a0 consequently,\u00a0 the possessor under title of ownership, and, in conformity with the law, he has in his favor the legal presumption that he possesses the land under sufficient title and he can not be obliged to\u00a0 produce it.\u00a0 A purchase verbally\u00a0 made gives a perfect title which, with the occupation or possession of the\u00a0 thing, confers ownership upon the\u00a0 possessor, provided\u00a0 that\u00a0 he holds himself out as its owner, until it be proved that he is not.\u00a0 It was incumbent upon\u00a0 the plaintiffs to prove a character distinct from that of owner, and only then could they compel\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant to prove\u00a0 (rather than\u00a0 to show,\u00a0 as very properly observes the learned commentator, Manresa) the title which\u00a0 actually confers\u00a0 upon him\u00a0 the status\u00a0 of owner.\u00a0 But the plaintiffs\u00a0 were unable to prove a character distinct from that of owner, by due and sufficient proof of a title under mortgage,\u00a0 or that of antichresis, which\u00a0 latter was certainly unknown in the\u00a0 Philippine Islands before the \u00a6publication of the Civil Code, except in\u00a0 exceedingly rare cases of pretorian pledges judicially established and approved - and this they\u00a0 were unable to do, for the reason that, as established\u00a0 at the trial, no\u00a0 instrument whatever was executed of the alleged mortgage or of Such an <i>antichresis;<\/i>\u00a0 and, at all times, at least since the promulgation of\u00a0 the Civil Code, the\u00a0 mortgage and the <i>antichresis<\/i>, as restrictions of ownership, must necessarily be recorded in writing,\u00a0 under the first\u00a0 paragraph of rule 4 of the transitory provisions of the Civil Code, in connection with articles 1875, 1279, and 1280.<br\/><br\/>On these\u00a0 grounds\u00a0 alone,\u00a0 the judgment\u00a0 appealed from should be affirmed.\u00a0 But conceding, for a moment, some value to\u00a0 the testimony taken, and on the hypothesis that it were necessary to\u00a0 consider it\u00a0 critically and reasonably in order to\u00a0 reach a conviction beyond all doubt, by a preponderance of evidence offered by\u00a0 one of the litigating parties, even then, and in such a case, this preponderance could not be admitted in favor of the plaintiffs.<br\/><br\/>The following witnesses testified for the plaintiffs:\u00a0 Dionisio Acodo,\u00a0 as to the delivery\u00a0 of the 50 pesos under security\u00a0 of the land; Gregoria Vinco, Romualda Jumero,\u00a0 and Cosme Jumero,\u00a0 to the\u00a0 effect\u00a0 that,\u00a0 twenty years\u00a0 before, according to the first two, and two years before, according to the last, the\u00a0 defendant, Jacinto Lizares,\u00a0 had negotiated with their predecessors in interest, Felix Jumero and Pedro Jumero,\u00a0 respectively, for the conversion of the mortgage into a sale; Rufino Brasileno, with respect to what\u00a0 he\u00a0 had heard Jacinto Lizares say to Gregoria Vinco and\u00a0 another woman,\u00a0 that if they\u00a0 had not\u00a0 sued him,\u00a0 he would have allowed them to redeem the land; and Aniceto Lacson, as to his attempt, at the request of Jacinto Lizares, to buy the land for\u00a0 the latter.<br\/><br\/>Examining all this testimony in detail, the following particular can not but be criticised:<br\/><br\/>First.\u00a0 Gregoria Vinco, the adjacent owner to the south of the land in litigation, testified that twenty years before Jacinto Lizares\u00a0 sent for her father-in-law, Felix Jumero, who went to\u00a0 the house of Jacinto Lizares in company with his\u00a0 eldest son, Nicolas, the husband of the witness, with\u00a0 her husband's sister, Romualda,\u00a0 and the witness herself, and that there Lizares told them that,\u00a0 as\u00a0 the land was mortgaged, he would add 150 pesos more, in order that the land might be sold to him.\u00a0 When the witness\u00a0 was\u00a0 asked\u00a0 on cross-examination when she had married her husband, Nicolas, she replied:\u00a0 \"Thirty-eight years ago;\u00a0 that is, two or four years after he was chosen as a recruit.\"<br\/><br\/>Romualda Jumero testified:<br\/><blockquote>\"When my\u00a0 brother\u00a0 was\u00a0 drafted, it happened that my father did not have the money to redeem\u00a0 him, and he went and borrowed\u00a0 the sum\u00a0 of 50 pesos from Lieutenant Jacinto Lizares, and gave him that land as security.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 Who told you that your father and Jacinto Lizares made that agreement? - A.\u00a0 I accompanied my father when we went to Lizares's house.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 Who was your companion when you and your father went\u00a0 to\u00a0 Jacinto Lizares's house? - A.

About forty years ago.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 How many times were you in Lieutenant\u00a0 Lizares's house to talk about that land? - A. I only went once.\"<\/blockquote>The conclusion is, first, that Romualda\u00a0 Jumero, contrary to the statement made by\u00a0 Gregoria Vinco,\u00a0 did not go\u00a0 to Jacinto Lizares's house, and did not hear what is asserted to have been said about the conversion of the mortgage into a sale; and, second, that\u00a0 this witness testified in regard\u00a0 to the alleged contract\u00a0 of guaranty, made as she\u00a0 herself asserted, forty years before and when questioned at the beginning\u00a0 of her testimony,\u00a0\u00a0 \"How\u00a0 old\u00a0 are\u00a0 you?\" replied, \"About forty years, I\u00a0 believe.\"<br\/><br\/>The following witnesses testified for the defendant: Gregoria\u00a0 Meruegos, Hilaria Jumero, Anatolio Jumero, Basilio Alferio as the\u00a0 husband of\u00a0 Felisa Jumero, Simon Lizares, and Francisco\u00a0 Lizares.\u00a0 Of these, the first\u00a0 four, and the last, averred that the sale was made by the Jumero family; that is, by the four children of Benedicto Jumero, because of the\u00a0 need to\u00a0 redeem\u00a0 from the military service\u00a0 a son\u00a0 of Felix Jumero, the husband of Gregoria Vinco who, as aforesaid, is an adjacent owner of land to the south of the property in question and\u00a0 the same person who, according\u00a0 to the testimony of Hilaria Jumero,\u00a0 built two houses, a large and a\u00a0 small one, on the land in dispute \"and on account\u00a0 of that the suit began.\"\u00a0\u00a0 The witness Hilaria Jumero testified that Aniceto Lacson made her an offer to buy the land\u00a0 in question for 700 pesos, inasmuch as it had been acquired very cheaply.\u00a0 This testimony was confirmed by Aniceto Lacson, in rebuttal, who stated that he had offered her 400 pesos,\u00a0 but that Hilaria Jumero replied that Jacinto Lizares had also made her an offer.<br\/><br\/>Gregoria Meruegos,\u00a0 on cross-examination, stated that she had on some occasion said\u00a0 that the land\u00a0 in question was pledged to Lizares, but that as it had not been redeemed it was the same as though the latter had acquired it by purchase.\u00a0\u00a0 \"If you had not sued me, I would have allowed you to redeem the land,\" are words that the plaintiffs' witness, Rufino Brasileno, attributes\u00a0 to\u00a0 Lizares.\u00a0 Such\u00a0 are the results obtained from the oral evidence.<br\/><br\/>With all the testimony of the witnesses, proof was not adduced of the existence of the mortgage\u00a0 contract, which, on the other hand, would not cause the debtor's land\u00a0 to pass to the control of the creditor.<br\/><br\/>It is not irrational\u00a0 to accept as\u00a0 conclusive the testimony of the\u00a0 defendant's witnesses, although they were partners-on-shares\u00a0 of, or\u00a0 in any other manner dependent on, the defendant, because they testified against their own interest in affirming that the land had been\u00a0 transferred by sale.<br\/><br\/>It is likely, considering the custom\u00a0 of\u00a0 the locality, and indeed a general\u00a0 one throughout the Islands, that the land was sold\u00a0 with right\u00a0 6f redemption,\u00a0 and hence that its redemption should be\u00a0 spoken\u00a0 of as\u00a0 possible\u00a0 or as a\u00a0 mere concession\u00a0 on the part of the creditor; but, on such a hypothesis, it was a redemption which could not be demanded of the vendee,\u00a0 by reason\u00a0 of the prescription acquired, whether the time is computed in accordance with the previous\u00a0 legislation, or whether, as it\u00a0 is strictly proper,\u00a0 such time limit, already expired, be that specified\u00a0 in the Civil Code; inasmuch\u00a0 as, even admitting that it was stipulated that the\u00a0 right to repurchase or redeem\u00a0 should last for an indefinite time, such period\u00a0 is restricted to ten years, under paragraph 2 of article 1508 of the Civil Code, and this period has already\u00a0 elapsed since\u00a0 its\u00a0 promulgation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Art.\u00a0 1939, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellants.<br\/><br\/><i> Torres, Johnson,<\/i> and <i>Moreland, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><i>Carson,J.<\/i>, concurs in the result.<br\/><\/div>",

If the principal penalty imposed is to be undergone by the criminal confined in a penal institution, he shall continue therein, although said detention cannot exceed one third of the term of the sentence, and in no case can it exceed one year:<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>*******<\/p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&quot;(6) Philippine Penal Code, article 52:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The personal liability which the criminal may have incurred by reason of insolvency shall not exempt him from the reparation of the injury caused and indemnification of damages if his pecuniary circumstances should improve; but it shall exempt him from the other pecuniary liabilities included in Nos. 3 and 5 of article 49.&quot;<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>It is the contention of the plaintiff in error that the judgment of the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands should be reversed for two reasons: First, because the judgment, was in substance and effect, an imprisonment for debt; second, because the court should have dismissed the case without prejudice to the right to institute a civil action for the rendition of accounts.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>As to the first contention, that the judgment and sentence amounted to imprisonment for debt: The Act of July 1, 1902, providing for the administration of the affairs of the Civil Government of the Philippine Islands (32 Stat. at L., 091, chap. 1369), provides among other things, in section 5 thereof, &quot;that no person shall be imprisoned for debt.&quot; This provision was carried to the Philippine Islands in the statute quoted with a well-known meaning, as understood when thus adopted in to the&#39; Bill of Rights for the government of the Philippines, and must be so interpreted and enforced. (Kepner <em>vs.<\/em> United States, 195 U. S., 100, 124; 49 L. ed., 114, 122; 24 Sup. Ct. Rep., 797; 1 A. &amp; E. Ann. Cas., 655.)<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Statutes relieving from imprisonment for debt were not intended to take away the right to enforce criminal statutes and punish wrongful embezzlements or conversions of money. It was not the purpose of this class of legislation to interfere with the enforcement of such penal statutes, although it provides for the payment of money as a penalty for the commission of an offense. Such laws are rather intended to prevent the commitment of debtors to prison for liabilities arising upon their contracts. (McCool <em>vs.<\/em> State, 23 Ind., 129; Musser <em>vs.<\/em> Stewart, 21 Ohio St., 353; <em>Ex parte<\/em> Cottrell, 13 Neb., 193; 13 N. W., 174; Re Ebanhack, 17 Kan., 618, 622.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>This general principle does not seem to be controverted by the learned counsel for the plaintiff in error, and the argument is, that inasmuch as the money adjudged is to go to the creditor, and not into the public treasury, imprisonment for the nonpayment of such sum is an imprisonment for debt. But we think that an examination of the statutes of the Philippines and the judgment of the Supreme Court shows that the imposition of the money penalty was by way of punishment for tne offense committed, and not a requirement to satisfy a debt contractual in its nature, or be imprisoned in default of payment.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Section 5, article 535, of the Penal Code, provides that those who, to the prejudice of another, shall appropriate or misapply any money, goods, or any kind of personal property which they may have received as a deposit on commission for administration, or in any other character producing the obligation to deliver or return the same, or who shall deny having received it, shall incur certain penalties. As a further means of punishing the act done in violation of the statute, he may, under the Philippine Code, be made to suffer a subsidiary imprisonment for a term not to exceed one third of the principal penalty in lieu of the restoration of the sum found to be embezzled. The sentence of the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands, including the imprisonment in lieu of the payment of the sum found due, was because of the conviction for the violation of this statute; in other words, the money payment was part of the punishment, and was not imposed as an imprisonment for nonpayment of the debt, regardless of the criminal offense committed. The sentence and each part of it was imposed because of the conviction of the defendant of the criminal offense charged.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>This situation is not changed because the sentence provides for a release from the subsidiary imprisonment upon payment of the money wrongfully converted. The sentence imposed, nevertheless, includes the requirement to pay money because of the conviction of the offense. The requirement that there shall be no imprisonment for debt was intended to prevent the resort to that remedy for the collection of contract debts, and not to prevent the state from imposing a sentence for crime which should require the restoration of the sum of money wrongfully converted in violation of a criminal statute. The nonpayment of the money is a condition upon which the punishment is imposed. (State <em>vs.<\/em> Nicholson, 67 Md... 1; 8 Atl., 817.)<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>We do not think that the sentence and judgment violated the statute providing that no person shall be imprisoned for debt.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>As to the second objection, that the court should have dismissed the cause without prejudice to the right of instituting a civil action, the argument seems to be that this should be so because the payment of the money adjudged, or suffering the &quot;subsidiary imprisonment&quot; imposed, would not, as the supreme court adjudged, bar the creditor from a civil action to recover any sum which he might prove to be due in excess of the judgment rendered in the present cabe. &quot;In other words,&quot; says the learned counsel, &quot;imprisonment will satisfy (and therefore discharge) the judgment here rendered, leaving another and wholly civil action open to the complainants, to recover any additional sum arising out of the same cause of action.&#39;&quot; This possibility is said to be so wholly unjust that it ought not to be permitted to exist in any country subject to American jurisdiction. But we fail to appreciate the weight of this argument. We see no reason why the court may not, for the purpose of the criminal proceedings find the amount wrongfully converted by the defendant for the purpose of fixing the sentence in this case, leaving the firm defrauded to recover in a civil action any sums or sums in excess of that amount which may be found due and remain unpaid to them. We are unable to perceive in this action such violation of the fundamental principles of justice as required the dismissal of the criminal action, leaving the parties complaining to the remedies of a civil suit.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>We find no error in the judgment of the court below, and the same is affirmed.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Affirmed<\/em>.<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<hr \/>\r\n<p>[1]217 U.

See, for the general functions of the Court of Land Registration, Carino <em>vs.<\/em> Insular Government, 212 U. S., 449, 53 L. ed. .594, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep., 334; Reavis <em>vs.<\/em> Fianza, 215 U. S., 16, 54 L. ed. 72, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep., 1. This writ of error is prosecuted to a judgment of the Supreme Court, affirming the trial court in refusing, on the opposition of the Insular Government, the prayer for registration.<p><\/p><p>The right to prosecute the writ is challenged on the ground that the amount involved is not sufficient to confer jurisdiction, and because there are no questions arising adequate alone to give jurisdiction. Without going into detail, we say, in view of the affidavits filed in this court concerning the value of the property, after allowing for the elements of speculation possibly entering into the amount fixed in the affidavits, we think, in the absence of affidavits in rebuttal, a sufficient showing has been made to give jurisdiction. We therefore overrule the motion to dismiss, and proceed to the merits.<\/p><p>To reduce the case to the issues essential to be decided requires a statement of the source and history of the title whose registry was asked. We therefore at once state the salient and indisputable facts on that subject. On the 24th of March, 1885, by act before a notary public, Jose Mercado. declaring that he owned and possessed two parcels of irrigated land situated in Sibul, pueblo of San Miguel de Mayumo, sold the same for cash to Juan Roura. A few weeks after, on May the 3d, 1885, the acting petty governor of the pueblo of San Miguel de Mayumo issued a certificate, stating that Jose Mercado had declared to him that he possessed and -owned three parcels of irrigated land in the pueblo, two of which are rice lands and the other serves as a building lot and garden, where he has his house erected; that he had possessed the land peaceably and uninterruptedly for more than thirty years, and asking that a certificate be issued as to the truth of these declarations. It was recited in the certificate that the \"commune of leading citizens\" was convoked and that they unanimously declared that the statements of Mercado were in effect true. The certificate was signed by the petty governor and the individual citizens who had been convoked to pass upon its statements. The purpose of obtaining the certificate does not appear, but it; is inferable that it was intended to be used in a proceeding to be instituted by Mercado to obtain a recognition from the proper administrative authorities of his alleged title to the land. We say this because, four months after, it appears among the files of a proceeding in which, on September 10, 1885, the general directorate of civil administration, under the authority vested in it by the regulations authorizing it to adjust and compose outstanding claims of title to the royal and unreclaimed lands, directed a deed to be issued to Mercado covering two tracts of land in the pueblo of San Miguel de Mayumo upon the payment of two and a fraction pesos. The sum thus to be paid, it was declared represented 10 per cent of the assessment of the land, and was exacted \"for the expense of surveying the measurement to be made by a deputy surveyor of unreclaimed lands and the fees for the title deed, according to the provisions of the decree of the general government of these islands of September 12, 1882, approved by royal order of July 25, 1884.\" On October 19, following, the director general of civil administration executed, on behalf of the directorate, a deed to Mercado of two pieces of real estate situated in the pueblo of San Miguel de Mayumo, the description of the second of which pieces in a general sense conformed as to its exterior boundaries to the description of one of the pieces which had been previously sold by Mercado to 3oura, and also of one of the pieces described in the certificate of the petty governor. In making this deed, the director general declared that it was executed conformably to the decree of the general directorate of September 7, 1885, by which decree the ownership of the land had been \"awarded gratuitously to Mercado.\" Shortly prior to the making of the deed by the director general to Mercado, that is, on September 25, and shortly following, on November 9, deeds autorized by the general directorate, to unreclaimed land in the pueblo of San Miguel, were made, the one in favor of Regino Pengson, and the other in favor of the parish priest of San Miguel. While the description of the land embraced by these two deeds, or the surveys contemporaneously made concerning the same, are not in the record, it is established that the land which they embraced was surveyed by the official surveyor who surveyed the Mercado land, and that it was not supposed by the directorate that there was any conflict between the three claims.<\/p><p>Shortly after the making of the Mercado deed it would seem that a complaint was made to the directorate of civil administration by Pengson, based upon an alleged conflict between the descriptions of the land embraced in the composition sale made to him and that described in the composition deed to Mercado. The precise character and extent of this conflict is not disclosed, but it is inferable from the documentary evidence that it related to the situation of a medicinal mineral spring, which was apparently claimed by both, Pengson under his composition and by Mercado under his. The matter was heard by the directorate of civil administration, and the result of the investigation of that body was by it reported to the governor general, with its recommendation for his action.<\/p><p>The governor-general, conformably to the recommendations made to him, issued an order annulling the composition proceedings, and the deeds issued thereunder to Pengson, Mercado, and parish curate. It was expressly directed that all the proceedings in the several compositions be annulled, reserving the right of the parties to apply for a new composition. It was further directed, however, that before such new composition be allowed, a competent surveyor be appointed, who should mark out the boundaries of the medicinal mineral spring, with the appurtenant land necessary to enable the public to enjoy its benefits, and that such spring and the land so marked out should be held as public property, reserving to private owners the right to demand compensation for any private land taken in the execution of the order. In addition, the order commanded the local authorities to demand from Pengson, Mercado, and the parish priest a return of the deeds issued to them, which the order canceled; that the order be transmitted to the proper provincial and local authorities to be executed and put of record, in conformity to law. The order was published in the official gazette at Manila, and was undoubtedly communicated through the proper administrative channels to all the administrative officers who were concerned with its execution, including local officers of the pueblo of San Miguel. The grounds upon which the directorate recommended and the governor-general annulled the composition proceedings, as above stated, were thus enumerated in the official files:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"Account having been given by this central office to his excellency, the governor-general, of the proceeding instituted by Don Jose Fores on behalf of Don Regino Pengson, relative to a claim of lands granted by composition in the barrio of Sibul, pueblo of San Miguel de Mayumo, it being found that not only the land granted to the aforesaid Pengson, but also those granted to Jose Mercado and to the parish priest of San Miguel, do not agree in their location or boundaries with those set forth in the title deeds issued by this general directorate under date of November 9, October 19, and September 25 of last year, respectively, and that these differences originate in errors committed by the expert appraiser of lands, Don Jose Moreno, when he practiced the acts relative to said lands in the capacity of acting deputy of unreclaimed lands. And it being found that the Sibul spring has never been known as private property, nor is it included in land which may have this character, but rather that those medical waters have been utilized, without any hindrance or obstacle, not only by the residents of the pueblo, but by the public in general, as is evidenced amongst other things by a certificate of the municipal authorities of San Miguel de Mayumo, and is confirmed by the unanimous and universal voice of the public, and it being found that the general inspection of unreclaimed lands and this general directorate have been taken unawares by the aforesaid expert to issue, as they did issue, by virtue of the surveys made by him, titles of ownership by composition of the lands bordering upon the Sibul springs, by reason of which it might be believed that the spring is found included within some of them, and that the public and free zone which all springs have and need for their enjoyment had disappeared, and considering that the three proceedings referred to embrace a vice of nullity from their beginning, because the data which appear in the notes of survey and measurements of the lands and the plans which accompany them are not correct, and consequently the title deeds issued do not describe the lands such as they really are, and considering that the party responsible for this discrepancy is the expert, Don Jose Moreno, who, when called to explain the errors committed by him, has not done so satisfactorily, errors all the more inexcusable in that there are involved parcels relatively small and contiguous, and surveyed and measured with an insignificant lapse of time between one and the other, giving rise to the suspicion that said errors have not been caused solely by neglect nor lack of zeal, but voluntarily, and with knowledge of the mistakes which are contained.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>We state in a summary way the further official action concerning the medicinal spring referred to in the order. The governor-general directed the proper provincial and local authorities to establish at the spring a sanitarium for the use of the public. But this not being carried out, it was suggested that the spring be placed under the control of private persons for the purpose of- creating a sanitarium for the public benefit, and a moderate subvention from the treasury. This project also fell through, on the suggestion that private capital might not be willing to venture an. outlay for the erection of the sanitarium, because of the fear of outstanding claims to ownership of the spring, and the dread that it might ultimately not be held to be public property. Subsequently the provincial and local authorities were directed by the governor-general to investigate and report concerning the existence of alleged claims to private ownership of the spring, and, as incident thereto, to expressly report concerning its possession and use during the past. This order brought out an official statement as to the previous composition deeds, their annulment, etc., as we have stated them, coupled with a renewed declaration that investigation disclosed that the spring had never been possessed by any private person, but had always been enjoyed by the public and used as public property. Finally, in September, 1895, from Madrid, a royal decree was issued, the necessary effect of which was to sanction the previous action of the local authorities. This order directed that the spring, with adequate appurtenant property, be sold at public auction.<\/p><p>Long prior to this, in fulfillment of the order of the governor-general of March 5, 1886, in that year, and on the 23d of that month, demand was made of the curate of San Miguel for the return of the deed made to him in consequence of the composition proceedings, and he declared that he had mislaid the deed and could not find it. On the same day of the same month and year a demand was made both on Mercado and Pengson for their deeds. Pengson declared that, having filed his in the proceedings to vacate which had taken place before the directorate, he did not have the deed in his possession. Mercado declared that he had sold the land, and had delivered the deed to the purchaser. Not having disclosed who the purchaser was, further orders to call on him for disclosure were made, but he was absent and could not be reached. Afterwards, in October, 1890, Mercado having died, his widow, in answer to an official demand upon her, declared that the property covered by the co:u-position had been conveyed by her husband during his life to Roura, to whom the deed had been delivered, and that Roura being dead, the deed would probably be found in the possession of his heir and daughter, Maria Roura, and she, upon demand being made upon her, declared that during the lifetime of her father she had heard the title deed mentioned, \"but at the present time I am ignorant of its whereabouts.\" Although the precise date does not appear, it is certain that Roura died testate, and that, by an amicable adjustment and extrajudicial partition of his estate, his two daughters, Juana and Maria Roura, petitioners before the court of registration, become entitled to one undivided half each of his rights in and to the land conveyed by Mercado, if any such there were.<\/p><p>With this prelude, we are brought to the initiation of the proceedings in the court of land registration, now before us.<\/p><p>The petition was filed on September 19, 1904. It is alleged that the two plaintiffs were the equal undivided owners of a tract of land, which was described, the description evidently relating to one of the tracts of land which had been described in the deed from Mercado to Roura, and in the certificate issued to Mercado by the petty governor. It was besides alleged that the title of the petitioners was derived by them as heirs of their father, and that he had derived his title from the conveyance made to him by Mercado. It was averred that \"said property described is not occupied by anyone,\" and, aside from any inference of possession to be drawn from the alleged ownership, there was no averment whatever of possession. Various documents were annexed to the petition, among which it is only necessary to mention the certificate issued to Mercado in 1885 by the petty governor and the deed made by Mercado to Roura.<\/p><p>The Insular Government appeared and opposed the prayer for registration, on the ground that petitioners had no title to the property, and that it was a part of the public domain. When the case was called for hearing, the husband of Mrs. Modesta Pengson appeared in her behalf to resist the registration applied for, on the ground that she held title to the property, and time was given to formulate an opposition, but this was not availed of, and no further action was taken on behalf of Mrs. Pengson. At the trial the petitioners offered various documents to establish their heirship of their father, which need not be referred to. Declaring that the property to which the petition related was that secondly described in the deed from Mercado to Roura (containing the spring), the petitioners offered that deed and the plan or sketch of the property, which was made in 1885, at the time of the composition proceedings. In addition they offered an official file containing one of the administrative reports which we have stated; that is, the one saying that it would be unwise to seek to procure private capital for the purpose of establishing a sanitarium until the question of whether there was a private claim to the property was clearly settled. The Government offered files of the administrative proceedings, showing in great detail the facts which we have previously stated; that is, the order for composition in favor of Mercado by the directorate, the deed to him, the controversy originated by Pengson, the decree of the governor-general vacating the compositions, and annulling all that had been done under them, and, indeed, establishing all the facts as to notice, the investigation and reports as to possession, and the ultimate making of the royal decree. The evidence being closed, counsel for the petitioner thus stated to the court the proposition upon which he relied to secure the allowance of the registration of the title as prayed:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"The court offers to hear the oral argument of Sr. Ferrer. Sr. Ferrer stated that he sought the Court of Land Registration to obtain title deed to the parcel of land which is the subject of the proceeding. The right which his principals invoked was derived from the right of the original owner, Don Jose Mercado, who acquired the same by virtue of the grant made by the council of civil administration for a stipulated sum, in exchange for the parcel of land. The deceased, Juan Roura, father of the petitioners, acquired possession of this land by virtue of a deed of sale executed by Don Jose Mercado in his favor, and from him the petitioners inherited the same. After some time had elapsed, the general government annulled that title by grant without returning the money consideration for the land, and without previously hearing the defenses which the aggrieved owner might set up, when, as a matter of fact, this matter ought to have been heard before the competent court. This is not legal; it is an embezzlement, since it cannot be conceived that after the possession of this real estate had been lawfully granted, and the cost thereof had been paid to the satisfaction of both parties, as is witnessed by the documents in evidence, all the transaction should be afterward retroactively annulled. <br\/><\/p><p>\"These points having been explained, he requested the registration of the property in the name of his clients.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The court denied the prayer for the registration of the title. Summarily stated, it was of opinion, (<em>a<\/em>) that the subject of making the composition as to the unclaimed land and awarding a deed was within the administrative authority of the officials, as was also the right to revoke and cancel the deed within a limited time for error found to exist or fraud discovered to have been practiced in obtaining the deed; (<em>b<\/em>) that it was unnecessary to inquire whether irregularities existed in the proceedings by which the deed was canceled, or whether an abuse of administrative discretion had happened in those proceedings, because the Spanish law created express and exclusive remedies for the correction of such errors, and required that those remedies should be resorted to within a time designated, and did not therefore allow such complaints to become the subject matter of ordinary judicial controversies; (<em>c<\/em>) that as the deed which was relied upon as the basis for registration was the mere result of a composition proceeding, and was, in its essence, not a contract upon a moneyed consideration, but a mere gratuitous award, without the payment of a price, the question of error committed in the annulment proceedings came within one or the other of the systems of administrative recourse provided by the Spanish law, which, not having been availed of, operated to deprive of the right to complain judicially of the cancellation; (<em>d<\/em>) that there was no room for holding that the right to registry obtained because of a prescriptive title, acquired under the composition deed to Mercado by virtue of article 1957 of the Civil Code, providing that \"ownership and other property rights in real property are prescribed by possession for ten years * * with good faith and a proper title,\" because, first, from the date of the annulment of the title good faith had in any event ceased to exist, and, second, because of the absence of the essential element of possession; since \"it has not been proved that there had been exercised, either before or after the declaration of nullity of the title, any possessory act on the part of the petitioners or of their predecessor. All effort of counsel for the petitioners consisted, after the opposition of the Insular Government was known, in proving that the former administration did not act within its powers in declaring the nullity of the title deed offered.\" The case having been carried to the Supreme Court, that court affirmed the judgment upon grounds substantially identical with those which controlled the action of the trial court.<\/p><p>Although we have concluded, from a consideration of the opinion of the court below, aided by the painstaking and full reference to the Spanish law contained in the brief on behalf of the Insular Government, that the court below was clearly right in its opinion as to the legal principles held to be decisive, we do not stop to state and review those considerations, because we think the argument at bar renders it unnecessary. We say this, because the argument for the plaintiffs in error in substance, but proceeds upon the theory that, although the Spanish law was correctly expounded by the court below, nevertheless that law was in apposite because of conditions which it is insisted existed prior to and at the time the composition deed was issued and when the administrative order of annulment of that title was made. The proposition is thus stated in the argument:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"The position of the plaintiffs may be very briefly summarized as follows: In 1885 Jose Mercado was already by virtue of his thirty years' possession, the absolute owner of the land in question. The composition deed of October 19, 1885, did not create his title, but was merely evidence of it. The decree of March 5, 1886, was wholly ineffectual to devest his ownership, and at most only affected the record evidence of such ownership. It is immaterial that no affirmative proceedings were taken by Mercado or his successors in interest to question the validity and effect of the decree of annulment. They were justified in relying on their undisturb possession and awaiting adverse action, when it would be open to them to raise all such questions. This ownership, founded on possession, was in itself a<\/p><\/blockquote><p>property right, protected by the treaty of Paris and the organic act, entitled to registration as a title in fee simple. The Insular Government is now asking this court to carry into effect even beyond its very terms a decree of a Spanish governor-general, made thirteen years before the cession, which is void on its face, as in violation of the fundamental laws of the former government, and by virtue of such void decree, to deny plaintiffs' ownership of lands which have been in their possession for fifty years\u2014a possession which the Spanish government never undertook to disturb.\"<\/p><p>And the theory of established possession upon which the contention rests is reiterated in many forms of expression throughout the entire argument. But when the statement of the case which we have made is considered, it becomes apparent that this contention misconceives the case as presented, since it proceeds upon an assumption unwarranted by the pleadings and unsustained by any proof whatever. As we have seen, the case as made by the pleadings was rested solely upon the right to register resulting from the composition deed, without the slightest ^verment of possession prior to the time that deed was issued, except as it may be considered that such possession was alleged as a necessary result of the averments as to the deed. It is further evident that the validity of the deed to Mercado was the one issue which arose on the opposition of the Insular Government. That this was understood by both parties clearly results from the fact that not a particle of proof was offered concerning the possession prior to or at the time of the composition deed, irrespective of the administrative proceedings leading up to the issue of that deed and following on its annulment. This, moreover, is additionally demonstrated by the express declaration of counsel for petitioners concerning the matter for decision, made after the evidence was in and the case was ripe for consideration. That the trial court had not the remotest thought that such issue was before it is plainly manifest from its statement that all the effort of the counsel of petitioners was directed to assailing the competency of the administrative officers to avoid the Mercado deed and annul the composition proceedings, and that no evidence whatever had been offered to prove possession of the property in controversy by Mercado or any of those holding under him, from the date of the deed up to and including the time of the submission of the cause. That this conception of the issue also prevailed when the case was taken to the Supreme Court of the islands we think is plainly apparent from the assignment of errors, referred to by the Supreme Court in its opinion. We think it also conclusively results from the opinion of the Supreme Court, when considered as a whole, that that court also thought the issue presented to it was thus limited. True it is that a concluding passage in the opinion of the Supreme Court is referred to as indicating that the court thought that the question of the acquisition by Mercado of the title to the property by preemption prior to the composition deed was involved. But we do not think the passage in the opinion, when taken in connection with its context, has the meaning attributed to it. If it had, it would be the merest <i>obite<\/i>r, since the pleadings did not raise that issue, and there was not the slightest proof concerning it. While it is not necessary, we deem it well to say that, in reviewing the action of the court below, we are, of course confined to the record and the case therein made, and may not, as the result of mistaken suggestions as to the issues and proof, disregard our duty by deciding, not the case as made, but an imaginary one, wherein issues not made and not presented below would have to be supplied, and whereby conjecture and surmise must be indulged to replace the total absence of all proof on a particular subject. So far as the unwarranted assumption concerning the subject of possession relates to acts done after the deed to Mercado, it is also disposed of by what we have said, and is besides completely answered by the express finding of both courts concerning the absence of all proof of possession during that period.

It will not be necessary to further discuss this question except in so far as it is necessarily involved in the consideration of the other question raised.<br\/><br\/>The question as to whether or not the merchandise should have been classified under paragraph 12 need not be considered, as the appellee does not now insist that the same should have been so classified; in fact he does not raise nor discuss the question, but asks that the judgment of the lower court be affirmed. It is therefore presumed that this question has been abandoned.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The only question to be determined is whether or not, by the proper interpretation, it can be held that the original protest filed with the collector at Cebu included both paragraphs 12 and 13 (b). These paragraphs are as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"12. Common or ordinary hollow glassware, G. W., one hundred kilos, eighty cents.<br\/><br\/>(<i>a)<\/i> Siphons for aerated waters, G. W., one hundred kilos, two dollars and eighty cents.<br\/><br\/>\"13. Crystal and glass imitating crystal:<br\/><br\/>(<i>a<\/i>)\u00a0\u00a0 Articles cut, engraved, painted, enameled, or gilt, G. W., one hundred kilos, twelve dollars;<br\/><br\/>(<i>b<\/i>)\u00a0\u00a0 The same,\u00a0 neither\u00a0 cut,\u00a0 engraved,\u00a0 painted, enameled, nor gilt, G. W., one hundred kilos, five dollars and sixty cents.\"<\/blockquote>Counsel for the appellee insist that by proper interpretation of the original protest it will be seen that it was made upon two grounds, which are set forth as <i>clearly<\/i> and <i>specifically<\/i> as the statute requires. The first ground was against the classification made because the tumblers were not held\" to be common ordinary hollow glassware under paragraph 12, supra, of the Tariff Law; the second ground was against their classification as cut glass. Apparently counsel were of the opinion that the second ground included paragraph 13 (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">b<\/span>) and excluded paragraph 13 <i>(a<\/i>).<br\/><br\/>The collector at the port of entry was of the opinion that the merchandise should have been returned under paragraph 12 and not under either subdivision of paragraph 13, but on account of instructions from his superiors the protest was dismissed. The Insular Collector of Customs was of the opinion that the tumblers should have been classified under paragraph 13 (<i>b<\/i>), but he dismissed the appeal, affirming the decision of the collector at Cebu, for the reason, as he said, that no claim had been made for the classification under this paragraph.<br\/><br\/>The classification under paragraph 13 (<i>a<\/i>) is admittedly incorrect and too high, so it is urged that in the interest of\u00a0 justice\u00a0 the\u00a0 merchandise\u00a0\u00a0 should\u00a0\u00a0 be\u00a0 returned\u00a0\u00a0 under paragraph 13 (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">b<\/span>) as found by the trial court. In this we agree, providing the appellee has by his original protest brought himself within this provision.<br\/><br\/>The law authorizing and governing protests made by importers to collectors of customs at ports of entry, appeals to the Insular Collector of Customs from the decision of collectors of customs at subports, and appeals to the Court of First Instance from the decision of the Insular Collector of Customs is sections 286 and 287 of Act No. 355, as amended by Act No. 1235. Section 286 provides that the decision of the collector of customs at the port of entry as to the rate and amount, etc., of duties chargeable upon imported merchandise shall be final and conclusive, unless the interested party, being dissatisfied with such decision, gives notice in writing, as provided in said section, to the collector of customs, \"setting forth distinctly and <i>specifically,<\/i> and in respect to each entry or payment, the reasons for his objections thereto.\" After this has been done the collector shall examine and decide the case thus submitted.<br\/><br\/>That the importer must present his notice within five days, exclusive of Sundays and holidays, is imperative. This is one of the principal reasons why he can not thereafter change, enlarge, or modify the basis of his protest. Section 14 of the Act of Congress of June, 1890, generally known as \"The Customs Administrative Act,\" has a corresponding provision covering the matter of protests against decisions of collectors of customs under the tariff laws of the United States. This section is, in substance, identical with that of our statute, the only material difference being that if the importer is dissatisfied with the decision of the collector, he must, <i>within ten days,<\/i> file his notice. This section also provides that he must give this notice in writing to the collector, \"setting forth therein distinctly and specifically, and in respect to each entry or payment, the reasons for his objections thereto.\" The decisions of the courts of the United States are therefore pertinent to the proper interpretation of our statute.<br\/><br\/>Before examining the original protest for the purpose of determining whether or not, from its contents, the protester brought itself within the provisions of paragraph 13 (<i>b<\/i>), we will examine some of the decisions of the United States courts which we think are applicable.<br\/><br\/>In the case of Davies <i>vs.<\/i> Arthur (96 U. S. Supreme Court Reports, 148), the plaintiff, Davies &amp; Co., in April, 1872, imported from Liverpool certain merchandise, a portion of which was described on the invoice as \"Ducape Eglington Ties,\" which were manufactured of silk, and used and known as neckties. Another portion of the merchandise was described as \"twill silk, cut up.\" The appraiser returned the ties as silk scarfs and the twill silk as silk in pieces. The collector imposed a duty of 60 per cent <i>ad valorem<\/i> upon each. The importers protested in writing against this assessment upon the ground that the merchandise \"should only pay duty, being articles worn by 'men, women, or children,' etc., and 'wearing apparel,'\" tinder section 22, Act of March 2, 1861, and section 13, Act of July 14, 1862, at 35 per cent ad valorem; the protesters further alleging that \"they (this merchandise) are neither 'scarfs' nor ready made clothing in fact, nor as known in trade and commerce.\" In this case the importers appealed from the decision of the collector of customs to the Secretary of the Treasury, who affirmed the action of the collector. Thereupon the protesters brought this suit. At the trial both parties agreed that the imported merchandise should have been classified as a manufacture of silk not otherwise provided for under the concluding clause of section 8 of the Act of June 30, 1864, and that it was dutiable at 50 per cent ad valorem, differing from the theory of each party as assumed at the time of the appraisement and liquidation of the duties. Notwithstanding this agreement and statement of facts, the protesters insisted that they had a right to recover the difference of 10 per cent between the proper duty and the duty exacted by the collector.<br\/><br\/>Inasmuch as the protesters specifically alleged that the merchandise should have been classified and assessed as above stated at 35 per cent <i>ad valorem<\/i>, and inasmuch as on the trial it was agreed that this merchandise should have been assessed at 50 per cent, the question was squarely before the court as to whether or not the protesters were entitled to the refund of the 10 per cent. The court held that they were not entitled to this refund, saying:<br\/><blockquote>\"Mistakes and oversights will sometimes lead to irregular assessment, and the object of the requirement is to prevent a party, if he suffers the mistake of oversight to pass without notice, from taking advantage of it when it is too late to make the correction, and to compel him to disclose the grounds of his objection at the time when he makes his protest.\"<\/blockquote>H. Bayersdorfer &amp; Co. at various dates in the year 1899 imported into the port of Philadelphia certain bleached wheat stems or wheat heads, which the collector assessed for customs duty at the rate of 25 per cent <i>ad valorem<\/i> under paragraph 251 of the Taritf Act of 1897. The importers filed a protest, addressed to the collector, against his action, setting forth the reasons for their objections in the following words:<br\/><blockquote>\"We claim that your assessment of duty at the rate mentioned is erroneous for the reason that the goods are free of duty as provided for in paragraph 617 of the Act of July 24, 1897, or in accordance with paragraph 548 of said Act. If not free of duty, we claim that they are subject to a duty of ten. per centum as nonenumerated manufactured articles, or at twenty per centum as nonenumerated manufactured articles in accordance with section 6 of the Act of July 24, 1897.\"<\/blockquote>The matter was brought before the Board of United States General Appraisers, who held that this merchandise did not come under any of the provisions of the Tariff Act specified in these protests and upon which the importers' claims were based.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The board expressed the opinion, however, that the merchandise in question came under paragraph 566 of the free list but held that the collector's classification must stand, inasmuch as no claim was made by the importers under this paragraph but under other specified provisions of the Act; and accordingly the board affirmed the collector's decision. The importers appealed from the decision of the Board of General Appraisers to the circuit court, claiming in their petition to the court that the merchandise was free of duty under paragraph 566. In the circuit court and in the circuit court of appeals the Government contended, as stated by the court in this case, that the importers upon their appeal to the court could not depart from or amend their protest against the classification and assessment by the collector of customs by setting up a claim under a paragraph not mentioned or referred to in their protests; and, second, that the bleached wheat stems or wheat heads could not be classified properly under paragraph 566 of the Act of 1897, and that the classification by the collector was correct. The circuit court, however, held that the protests were sufficient to enable the importers to avail themselves of paragraph 566, and that the classification should be made under that paragraph, and entered a decree reversing the decision of the Board of General Appraisers and in favor of the importers. The circuit court of appeals in passing upon this question said (p. 736):<br\/><blockquote>\"Upon the whole it is our conclusion that, as paragraph 566 was not mentioned or suggested in the protests here involved, but the importers' claims were based on other specified clauses, the Board of General Appraisers rightly held that paragraph 566 was not available to the importers, and we think that the decision of the board sustaining the action of the collector should have been affirmed by the court.\"<\/blockquote>The decree of the circuit court was reversed and the decision of the Board of General Appraisers was affirmed. (U. S. <i>vs. <\/i>H. Bayersdorfer &amp; Co., 126 Fed. Rep., 732.)<br\/><br\/>Practically the same question was raised, discussed, and decided by the same court in the case of U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Knowles &amp; Son (126 Fed, Rep., 737).<br\/><br\/>In the case entitled <i>In re <\/i>Austin et al. (47 Fed. Rep., 873), the protesters alleged that the classification of certain chocolate under the provisions of paragraph 239 and section 5 of the Tariff Act of October 1, 1890, was incorrect in making the merchandise dutiable, first, under paragraph 318, or, second, under section 4 of the said Act. The court found that the article was properly dutiable under paragraph 319, but said:<br\/><center><br\/>*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><\/center> <blockquote>\"Inasmuch as it appears by the protest that the importers did not call the collector's attention to paragraph 319 as being the one under which their goods should be classified, they can not avail themselves of the provisions of that paragraph in the appeal that they have taken from the collector's decision.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In the case of Herrman <i>vs.<\/i> Robertson (152 U. S., 521), the importer filed the following protest:<br\/><blockquote>\"The goods in question are liquidated by you as being liable to a duty of fifty cents per pound and thirty-five per cent <i>ad valorem.<\/i> We claim the goods are composed of hair and cotton only, and, as such, should pay a duty of thirty-five per .cent ad valorem as a nonenumerated article under the second half of section 2499 of the Revised Statutes, being the highest rate of duty which any of the component material pays.\"<\/blockquote>This merchandise was classified under the first clause of said section 2499 by the customs officers and the duties were assessed accordingly. The circuit court held that the decision in the case of Arthur <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>. Butterfield (125 U. S., 70) applied, and that the goods were \"manufactures of hair\" and as such provided for by the clause in schedule (m) of section 2504 of the Revised Statutes, under the phrase \"and all other manufactures of hair, not otherwise provided for, thirty per cent ad valorem,\" and therefore, being enumerated, were not within section 2499.<br\/><br\/>The Supreme Court of the United States affirmed the decision of the circuit court, saying (p. 526):<br\/><blockquote>\"In the case at bar the goods were apparently classified under the similitude clause, but that was not correct because they were to be regarded as 'manufactures of hair,' and therefore enumerated.<br\/><br\/>\"But the importers also insisted that the goods were non-enumerated, and did not assert that they were not within the clause relied on by the collector, save as it was objected, that they came under the last clause of section 2499, which was likewise incofrect. The protest failed to point out or suggest in any way the provisions which actually controlled, and in effect only raised the question which of two clauses, under one or the other of which it was assumed that the importation came, should govern as being most applicable. We agree with the circuit court in holding the protest to have been insufficient.\"<\/blockquote>On June 23, 1891, Salambier imported into the port of New York certain merchandise consisting of sweetened chocolate and known commercially as such. This chocolate was classified for custom duties at 50 per cent ad valorem under the provisions of paragraph 239 of the Tariff Act of October 1, 1890, and the duty was liquidated accordingly. The importer protested against this exaction and duly filed the following protest:<br\/><blockquote>\"Sir ; I do hereby protest against the rate of 50 per cent assessed on chocolate imported by me, str. <i>La Bretagne,<\/i> June 23, 1891.\u00a0\u00a0 Import entry 96,656 - M. S. No. 52\/53.<br\/><br\/>\"I, claiming that the said goods under existing laws are dutiable at 2 cents per 3b., and the exaction of a higher rate is unjust and illegal, pay the duty demanded to obtain possession of the goods, and claim to have the amount unjustly exacted refunded.\"<\/blockquote>The collector on receipt of this protest transmitted to the Board of Appraisers the record. The board rendered its decision, reversing the collector and holding that this merchandise was dutiable at 2 cents per pound under paragraph 319 of the Tariff Act, and that the importer should not be deprived of his remedy by reason of having failed to specifically claim classification of the imported merchandise as a manufacturer of cocoa under that paragraph. From this decision the Government appealed to the circuit court, which court affirmed the decision of the Board of Appraisers. The Government then appealed to the circuit court of appeals, and that court (circuit court of appeals) upon the facts in the case certified to the Supreme Court of the United States the following question of law for determination:<br\/><blockquote>\"Was the protest hereinbefore set forth a good and sufficient protest under existing law against the decision of the collector in his assessment of duty upon the appellee's importation of sweetened chocolate under the Tariff Act of October 1, 1890?\"<\/blockquote>The Supreme Court of the United States held that this protest was sufficient, saying:<br\/><blockquote>\"A protest is not required to be made with technical precision, but is sufficient if it shows fairly that the objection afterwards made at the trial was in the mind of the party and was brought to the knowledge of the collector so as to secure to the Government the practical advantage which the statute was designed to secure.\" (170 U. S., 621, 627.)<\/blockquote>As to the policy of the law and the authority and power of the court to order a' reliquidation of the entry in accordance with the paragraph which it may hold to be the proper one under which the classification should have been made, our attention has been invited to the case of <i>In re<\/i> Solvay Process Co. (134 Fed. Rep., 678), in which it is said (p. 680):<br\/><blockquote>\"It does not seem to be left to the Board of General Appraisers on appeal from the collector to impose the correct rate of duty when they know what the correct rate is, even as established by decisions of the court, unless the importer has pointed out specifically, in substance or effect, the error made, and the section, clause, or subdivision of the law under which the assessment ought to have been made. It seems to be the policy of the law, as enunciated in the decisions, to have the Board of Appraisers and the circuit court pass upon the correctness of the allegations of the protest, rather than on the merits of the case, even when the merits are perfectly apparent and gross injustice will be done by failing to correct the action of the collector.\"<\/blockquote>Paragraph 12 refers to common ordinary hollow glassware only. Note (<i>a<\/i>) under this paragraph has nothing to do with the question involved in this case. Paragraph IB is divided into two subdivisions and deals, first, with crystal and glass imitating crystal, cut, engraved, etc., and, second, with crystal and glass imitating crystal not cut nor engraved, etc. The phrase \"crystal and glass imitating crystal\" is equally applicable to each subdivision. Either subdivision is meaningless without this phrase. Neither can be applied without it. The merchandise was returned under paragraph 13 (<i>a<\/i>) as common ordinary glass imitating crystal in tumblers,<i> cut<\/i>, at $12 per hundred kilos. Against this classification the appellee protested, saying that the same should have been classified as common ordinary hollow glassware under paragraph 12. The appraiser held that the tumblers were glass imitating crystal, cut. The protester said the tumblers \"do not represent in any way an imitation of crystal, * *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *. We can not imagine that it was the intention of the tariff makers that tumblers of such a nature should be considered as cut and classified under paragraph 13 (<i>a<\/i>).<br\/><br\/>While we can not consider as forming the basis, or any part of the basis, of this action, the ground set forth in the appeal to the Insular Collector of Customs nor to the Court of First Instance, we can consider these grounds for the purpose of aiding us in the interpretation of the original protest.<br\/><br\/>In its appeal to the Insular Collector of Customs the appellee again stated its position clearly and distinctly, saying the tumblers \"do not in any way represent crystal, nor glass imitating crystal, and we are therefore of the opinion that the same should be classified under paragraph 12 as common ordinary hollow glassware and not under paragraph 13 as crystal and glass imitating crystal.\" It was not until an appeal was taken to the Court of First Instance that the protester even conceded that the tumblers might be returned under paragraph 13 (<i>b<\/i>) and this was after the Insular Collector had pointed this out. The protester not only did not include this paragraph (13-5) in his original protest but expressly excluded both subdivisions of that paragraph. The protester said that the tumblers are not \"cut,\" and do not represent in any way an imitation of crystal. Then if they were not cut they could not come under the first subdivision of paragraph 13, and if they did not represent in any way an imitation of crystal they could not have been classified under the last subdivision of that paragraph, as it is clear that before goods can be classified under either one of these subdivisions such goods must be either crystal or glass imitating crystal. Before they can be classified under the first subdivision they must not only be glass or glass imitating crystal but they must be cut, etc., and before they can be classified under the last subdivision they must either be crystal or glass imitating crystal not cut, etc. The law compelled the protester to disclose the grounds of its protest at the time of making the same. This the appellee did by specifically pointing out paragraph 12. The tumblers were so described in this protest as to exclude all possibility of returning them under either subdivision of paragraph 13. The goods, as we have said, were returned under paragraph 13 (<i>a<\/i>). The importer specifically stated that the goods should be classified under paragraph 12. The Insular Collector and the Court of First Instance were of the opinion that neither one of these provisions was applicable. We can not grant any relief in this case, as the importer only raised the one question, which of the two paragraphs, 12 or 13, should govern (Herrman <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>. Robertson, supra). When an importer specifically states his position in his protest he can not change. (Davies <i>vs<\/i>. Arthur, <i>supra<\/i>.)<br\/><br\/>An importer specifically pointed out three distinct paragraphs, one of which was a free-duty provision. It was found that the merchandise should have been classified as nondurable, but under a different provision from that pointed out by the importer in his protest. No relief was granted.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (U. S.<i> vs.<\/i> H. Bayersdorfer &amp; Co., <i>supra<\/i>.)<br\/><br\/>The case of United States <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>. Salambier, supra, is easily distinguished from the case at bar and the other cases cited in this opinion. Salambier imported certain sweetened chocolate which was classified by the collector at 50 per cent ad valorem. The importer claimed, without naming the provision of law, that the goods were dutiable at 2 cents per pound. There were only three paragraphs under which the merchandise could possibly have been classified, viz, paragraph 239, at 50 per cent, applied by the collector; paragraph 318, at 2 cents a pound, and paragraph 319 at the same rate, 2 cents a pound. In this case the Supreme Court of the United States said (p. 626):<br\/><center><br\/>*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*<br\/><\/center> <blockquote>\"The collector could not have been perplexed by the omission to name the specific paragraph which the importer sought to have applied, for there were but two paragraphs, besides 239, which dealt with the subject, namely, paragraphs 318 and 319, and under either of them the duty was that'claimed by the importer, 2 cents per pound.\"<\/blockquote>As was said in the case of In re Solvay Process Company, supra, it is the policy of the law to have the courts pass upon the correctness of the allegations of the protest, rather than on the merits of the case, even when the merits are perfectly apparent and gross injustice will be done by a failure to correct the action of the collector.<br\/><br\/>Two objects were intended to be accomplished by the provisions in the Act of the Commission: First, to apprise the collector of the objections entertained by the importer before it should be too late to remove them, if capable of being removed; and, second, to hold the importer to the objections which he then contemplated and on which he really acted.<br\/><br\/>In its original protest the appellee did not intend to include any provision except paragraph 12. He acted upon this theory and the collector at the subport so considered it. Neither of the parties thought for a moment that the importer wished the provisions of paragraph 13 (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">b<\/span>) applied. For these reasons the judgment appealed from is hereby reversed and that of the Insular Collector of Customs affirmed, without any special ruling as to costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

therefore,\u00a0 the exception thereto is hereby overruled.<br\/><br\/>The fourth assignment of error is of no\u00a0 importance; the intention was to state that there was no truth in the affirmation that\u00a0 the\u00a0 appellant had\u00a0 designated any\u00a0 property on which the sheriff might have brought\u00a0 an execution.<br\/><br\/>As\u00a0 to the second assignment of error, which\u00a0 is\u00a0 of more importance in\u00a0 connection with this question, the record shows that Exhibit A is a copy of the instrument of sale issued by the notary public before whom the\u00a0 same was executed, and by whom\u00a0 it was certified in accordance with the provisions of the Spanish notarial law followed at the time by the\u00a0 contracting parties and the notary.\u00a0 As required\u00a0 by\u00a0 said\u00a0 legislation,\u00a0 the original instrument was drawn up by the notary in his protocol, and a true copy of the same was issued by him to the interested parties.<br\/><br\/>The said exhibit A was offered\u00a0 in evidence,\u00a0 whereupon the representative of the appellant objected because it was not the original instrument; but\u00a0 as it was admitted by the court below, he limited himself to the following cross-examination :<br\/><blockquote>\"Q. Is the original of this\u00a0 document\u00a0 on file at your office? - A.\u00a0 I\u00a0 have now\u00a0 forwarded\u00a0 it to the keeper of the archives in Manila.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. And formerly did you only issue a copy of the original instrument? - A. Yes, sir.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. For\u00a0 what reason\u00a0 did\u00a0 you keep the original instrument? - A.\u00a0 To comply with\u00a0 the notarial law in force at the time.\"<\/blockquote>He\u00a0 said\u00a0 that the\u00a0 original had been\u00a0 forwarded to\u00a0 the custodian of the archives of the Philippine Islands on the 1st\u00a0 of March, 1904.<br\/><blockquote>\"Q. Have you any record in your office regarding the remittance of the original of this document? - A. Yes, sir; I have an inventory which was sent\u00a0 to me by the chief of the\u00a0 division of archives.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 Can you produce the record of the remittance of the original of\u00a0 said\u00a0 document? - A. Yes, sir,\u00a0 as soon as the court orders it.<br\/><br\/>\"The Court.\u00a0 If it is only an inventory it is all right, go and get it.\u00a0 (This the witness did.)<br\/><br\/>\"Witness. Here is the inventory and receipt\u00a0 from the custodian of archives wherein he acknowledges receipt of the documents sent in the protocols.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. That\u00a0 is all.\"<\/blockquote>With\u00a0 regard to the sixth and seventh\u00a0 assignments of error,\u00a0 not having before us case 133, with reference to which the court below has stated that neither in the record of the sale nor in the advertisement of the same had the provisions of the law been complied with, nothing\u00a0 can be established\u00a0 in this\u00a0 decision as a ground for\u00a0 affirming the first of the findings in the judgment, in so far as the sale made by the defendant sheriff is thereby held to be null and void.\u00a0 Therefore the said\u00a0 finding is hereby revoked.<br\/><br\/>The fifth\u00a0 assignment of error is directed against the second finding in the judgment, whereby the\u00a0 claim for the recovery of possession is granted by virtue of the evidence offered at the trial.\u00a0\u00a0 With the exception of two points the trial court\u00a0 has\u00a0 not\u00a0 committed the error attributed to\u00a0 it. It has rendered its decision upon the evidence and, judging by the preponderance of\u00a0 that offered\u00a0 by\u00a0 the plaintiff, it has held that the property now claimed was owned\u00a0 by the intestate estate of Bias Gerona when the same was attached by virtue of the order of execution\u00a0 issued in favor of the appellant in\u00a0 an\u00a0 action brought against the\u00a0 original owner thereof, Celestino Montero, who sold it to Bias Gerona prior to said\u00a0 execution,\u00a0 after\u00a0 which he died intestate.\u00a0 This preponderance\u00a0 of evidence arose,\u00a0 in the\u00a0 opinion\u00a0 of the judge,\u00a0 because of Exhibit A and the testimony of the\u00a0 witnesses\u00a0 who identified the property.<br\/><br\/>Against such preponderance of evidence thus considered, we find in the proceedings\u00a0 in.general nothing\u00a0 to destroy it, nor in\u00a0 so considering it has the court\u00a0 below violated\u00a0 any law.\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, the\u00a0 second finding\u00a0 in the judgment must be affirmed,\u00a0 with the exception\u00a0 of two points which are outside the scope of the finding.<br\/><br\/>In the\u00a0 complaint, the right of ownership of Bias Gerona is set forth in paragraph (c) to:<br\/><blockquote>\"One house of strong materials with a wooden floor, nipa sides, and cogon roof, erected on the said lot of Belison (<i>b<\/i>),\u00a0 being 6 <i>brazas<\/i> frontage and 5 deep, which house\u00a0 and lot are assessed at $150 Mexican currency.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In the\u00a0 letter (<i>a<\/i>) another house is described as a wooden house with its corresponding lot within the suburb of\u00a0 San Pedro with the boundaries\u00a0 as described\u00a0 therein.<br\/><br\/>Hence, claim is made for\u00a0 two houses,\u00a0 and as they no longer\u00a0 exist, the\u00a0 trial court\u00a0 orders the defendant to pay P300 as the value of the house described in paragraph (<i>a<\/i>), and P50 as that of the one described in paragraph (<i>c<\/i>).<br\/><br\/>In the first\u00a0 place, the second finding\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 judgment can not be affirmed, in so far as it declares that the intestate estate of Bias Gerona is\u00a0 the owner\u00a0 of all the\u00a0 property claimed, for the\u00a0 reason that it does\u00a0 not own the house mentioned in paragraph <i>(c<\/i>).\u00a0 The real proof of said ownership\u00a0 adduced by the plaintiff is the public instrument marked as \"Exhibit A,\" and\u00a0 in no manner does\u00a0 it appear therein that said\u00a0 house, which was erected on the lot in Belison (<i>b<\/i>), was ever sold by Montero to Gerona.\u00a0 Therefore, whether the\u00a0 building\u00a0 was destroyed or not, the plaintiff has nothing to do with a house of which he\u00a0 does not seem to be\u00a0 or ever to have been the\u00a0 owner,\u00a0 and\u00a0 this disposes of the indemnity\u00a0 of P50\u00a0 that\u00a0 the court\u00a0 below awarded him by the second finding.<br\/><br\/>In the second place, even admitting that Gerona and his intestate estate\u00a0 owned the\u00a0 house described\u00a0 in paragraph (<i>a<\/i>), and that if it existed, the judgment, in so\u00a0 far\u00a0 as it orders the same to be restored to the\u00a0 owner, would be in accordance with the law, yet\u00a0 as it has been shown at the trial that the loss\u00a0 of the house was not due to the fault of the possessor, Capadocia, but to superior force\u00a0 exercised by the municipal authorities of San\u00a0 Jose, Antique, proven in the\u00a0 proceedings\u00a0 by the testimony of said\u00a0 municipal president and by that of another witness, neither of whom have been discredited, the possessor in good faith can not be held liable for the value of the house.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, that portion of the second finding which orders that the defendant Santos Capadocia shall pay to the plaintiff P300 as the value of the house described in paragraph (<i>a<\/i>) of the complaint, and P50 for the house described in paragraph\u00a0 (<i>c<\/i>), can not lawfully be affirmed.<br\/><br\/>For the reasons above set forth, the judgment\u00a0 appealed from is affirmed in so far as it orders \"that the plaintiff, as owner of the property claimed, shall recover the possession and enjoyment of the same,\" in so far as it \"adjudicates to the said plaintiff the products that the said lands may have yielded from the 19th of July, 1907, until the date of their delivery,\" and in so far as it \"orders the defendants to pay the costs of the proceedings.\"\u00a0 With costs of this instance against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i> Torres, Johnson, Carson, <\/i>and <i>Moreland, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><\/div>",
